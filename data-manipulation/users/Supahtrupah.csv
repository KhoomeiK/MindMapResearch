But i understand them, they are waay poorer than the average tourist so they employ those extortion tactics since they ask around 10€ or smth for the photo. But these big companies with entire marketing and merchandising departments who still think this shit is a good idea...

I figure 90% of them go to waste.

Futurology,fe72ofe,t1_fe6zd9g,1578909127.0,"Exactly, precipitation like rain and snow require some form of planing by the government/country in general. When happens out of the blue it fucks shit up. 
Im from Serbia and in ~2015 we had a rainy period that lasted for weeks. Its not unusual in autumn to rain this long, but the amount that was falling was something we weren't capable of handling, this caused floods in many villages which included their farm land, all ruined. Cities like Belgrade had to build barriers around the major rivers in order to prevent flooding of areas near the river shore's. A city called Šabac had to redirect the flow of Sava river into nearby villages and flood them in order to prevent the flooding of a chemical dye factory on the shore. If that factory flooded, all the chemicals would have went downstream to Belgrade and later mixed into the Danube river. It would have been an international catastrophy.  To this day there are protests by the christian community in Belgrade because the redirection flooded an church that was in a valley. It's not pretty.

Futurology,fe6xnf6,t1_fe54tzr,1578907308.0,"I was talking more in a general sense, about the dangers of unpredictable climates. Does UAE have some factories close to rivers, are there inhabited areas close by, maybe areas with green houses. All that is at risk when flooding happens. Basically you don't want floods almost sa much as you don't want fires. You want manageable rain fall yes, that is good. You don't want unmanageable rain fall. Now think like this, if you want to be able to manage so much precipitation, you need to invest in infrastructure. Irrigation, sewage, dams, water barricades around rivers. And then next year there is no rain fall and you spent billions for rain that comes once in a blue moon. Governments don't tend to invest in uncertainty. And that is what UAE are experiencing, an anomaly that you cant prepare for."
Futurology,fe3hms7,t3_ennx14,1578849356.0,"This much rain brings more harm than good for countries not used to having such weather. Floods will absolutely devastate farming infrastructures potentially causing smaller yield of crops while racking up millions of dollars of structural damage to both government and civilian owned buildings. I see people seem to think in comments this is a good thing, but it really isn't. Unstable climate is a dangerous climate and we should be doing everything in our power to stabilise it across the globe, instead of changing it."

explainlikeimfive,fdmrtfm,t3_eluost,1578562628.0,"Think of it this way, if you stopped eating right now and just sat in your chair all day you would loose around 1500-2500 cals per day (less the subsequent days since your body would switch on battery saving mode). This is, of course, depends on your body's physiology. And of course this is over the period of about 24 hr. Whereas if you ate nothing and decided to go for a 15 min run, you would add about 50-100 cals to the previous number. This is why dieting and exercising is the perfect combination for loosing weight. You measure your base consumption (around 2k cals) then you form a 5 meal plan that adds up to 1500 cals (5 meals to avoid hunger and get used to eating small quantities of food) and add an hour of exercise a day (around 200-300 cals) and you get a daily deficit of 700-800 cals a day. Keep it up for 3 months and you will have shaved of quite some fat while developing muscle mass (which raises base body consumption), while also developing healthy habbits like frequent physical activity, healthy diet and removing negative habbits like overeating and a sedentary lifestyle."

Not in the sense of randomly attacking PC-s but would say thing to distressed PC-s that would make them feel worse. This char in combination with a friend who has a tendency to play lone wolf characters that often try to abandon the quest resulted in my char provoking his char to magic missle me in the face. As one other pc jumped on him to try and restrain him, my char out of vengeance used burning hands on both of them.
