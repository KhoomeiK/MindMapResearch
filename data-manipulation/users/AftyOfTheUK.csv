Regardless of that, CO2 changes the efficiency at which heat is radiated from the earth, reducing that efficiency meaning more heat gets trapped. Do you disagree?

When energy arrives at the the earth it does primarily as UV and visible light, with a smaller component of infrared.

When the earth radiates energy, it does so primarily as infrared, with some visible light.

CO2 (and other greenhouse gases) absorb infrared light far more effectively than they do UV or visible light.

This means that increasing CO2 concentrations has little effect on energy inbound - most of it just passes right through. But when energy is outbound from the earth as infrared - which CO2 can absorb more easily than UV some of that heat gets trapped by the CO2. The CO2 particle in the atmosphere heats up when it captures the energy from the infrared emission... and that heat energy eventually dissipates to other particles in the atmosphere. Hence, the atmosphere warms. Some of that heat dissipates into the oceans over time (at the atmosphere/ocean boundary).

Are you starting to get it now?

CO2 traps heat in the atmosphere that WOULD have been radiated away from earth if the CO2 was not there.

Understand?

(And you can experimentally verify this trivially, and it has been done. Simply emit infrared radiation from one side through a chamber containing an atmosphere-similar mixture of gas, varying just the CO2 concentration. As you increase CO2 concentration, the temperature of the gas rises with it - and the amount of energy from the infrared radiation which manages to reach the other side of the chamber decreases. You can do this experiment with simple equipment, and it's been done time and time again in universities)

EDIT: Also, for your benefit, when I said ""prevents energy reflected or released from the earths surface from reaching space with 100% efficiency"" the meaning was intended to be ""without greenhouse gases, the energy emitted from the earth would reach space with 100% efficiency. Greenhouse gases prevent that 100% efficiency"".

Because it works far, far better than any other system we've ever tried to use. Every time people try to use a different system, people end up starving and killing each other for basic necessities.

Our system is based around people providing goods or services to others - the more you provide, the more you're able to get. It's inherently extremely fair. Some people see a problem with that, and seem to think everyone ""deserves"" a certain standard of living - often a very high one, complete with all manner of goods and services that are scarce or rare. I'm not sure why we feel that someone who doesn't give anything back to society deserves so much stuff for free.

As an example, in my country people are provided with housing for free, to a standard far better than I've lived in most of my life, despite me earning over 2x the average income and paying a ton of tax on it. I've always lived in shared rooms in a shared house - but if you lose your job and have no money, my government will pay for you to live in your OWN house (not having to share with others).

Making money has nothing to do with tax. Tax is what is taken AFTER money is made.

Those wealthy people made the money, tax takes it away from them. Yes, they could be paying more tax, but THAT is the wealth redistribution. With ZERO rates of tax there would be no wealth distribution.

It's worth bearing in mind that the top 1% pay 23% of all tax. It might not be as much as you like, but it is a huge amount.

You are attempting to redefine the phrase to mean something it doesn't.

> I also don't believe, at a more fundamental level, that just because a number exists on a paycheck or on a stock dividend portfolio, that that means that the person receiving that document has 'made' that money.

I'd suggest you get in sync with the rest of the world then.

> Nobody makes money in a vacuum. We're all part of society, and that money flows between us due to our values, principles, rules, and expectations as a society. 

Nope, money flows between when we provide goods or services in return for money. You can have whatever values you want, but if you don't do things for other people, you're not making money, you're a drain on society.

> When people begin earning more than a family can reasonably spend to live in extreme luxury, I think as a society, we have an expectation to step in and say 'no, you're not reasonably earning more than that.'

What if doing that makes everyone poorer via two mechanisms? One: removing the profit incentives causes people not work so hard or so smart, reducing overall wealth. And two: by spreading resources around you prevent the gains in efficiency that are found when smart people manage the resources.

> So that means we probably have a difference of opinion.

Yes, massively. You seem to think people have some moral right to the fruits of others' labour."

Wealth redistribution might not mean what you think it means. Wealth redistribution is about taking the money from the people who made it, and giving it to people you feel are more deserving.

The right is all about leaving the money with the people who made it."

Checking Wikipedia, most of the allegations of his inappropriate dating are  from women 16 and older. There's just a single one from a girl who claims she was 14 - he admits the others, and denies this one.

Now of course, I've no idea whether he's telling the truth or not, but our discussion that led us to the conclusion was based on a guy of 32 and a girl of 16. A bit creepy, yes, but by the standards of the time would have received a beating from a father or brother, rather than a jail sentence.

Personally, I wouldn't have voted for him either way, but it served as an example of how changing times can affect the views of an incident. Attempting to judge people of yesterday by the standards of today is what has resulted in people in my country villifying one of our greatest leaders (Churchill) because he could sometimes be an asshole - ignoring the fact that for his time he was a standup man.

They seem to forget that in 50 years time, or 100 years time, people will look back on today and judge us. Should we be judged by the standards of our time, or theirs? For example I suspect in a hundred years or so the concept of owning residential property for profit will be viewed as pure evil... but I don't think a landlord renting out their house today is pure evil."

While this is a very difficult thing to quantify, you should be made aware that it's probably untrue. States which voted Trump in 2016 had a turnout rate of 50.2% while states which went for Clinton averaged 52.7% - a significantly higher turnout.

This is completely and utterly incorrect and is VERY dangerous advice. PLEASE anyone reading disregard this.

Your statement here is true ONLY if you are travelling to work in the US under a VERY specific set of circumstances. For example, you are travelling for internal meetings within your own company - then you are fine to travel on an ESTA.

However, if you fall into ANY of the following categories you MUST apply for a business visa (or run the risk of a ten year ban from the US, something which two people I know have done - including one I would like to come to my wedding in California, but who cannot).

* Providing services as a sole contractor or freelancer in any capacity to any company within the US
* Negotiating contracts
* Providing consultation to client companies not owned by the company you are employed by (and permissively this extends to companies within a group ownership scheme, though I'm told this is only by convention and not by law)
* Being paid additional recompense specifically for the time in the US (if you're paid more because you're visiting the US, you need a visa)
* Engaged in sales or sales processes with clients in the US, for a company based outside the US
