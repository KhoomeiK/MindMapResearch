AppleWatch,ffdzxtp,t1_ffdzups,1579833132.0,I’d restart the watch as well.
AppleWatch,ffdzk1z,t3_et3chu,1579832856.0,Did you try restarting both the watch & the phone?  That usually clears up any glitches for me.

AppleWatch,ffaznx3,t3_eslp3v,1579748211.0,"No, you don’t. I had cellular on my 3 but wasn’t used as I always have my phone with me.  When I upgraded to the 4, I didn’t get the cellular & haven’t missed it. Was a waste of money for me.  Just depends on you personal situation. If you’re a runner or something like that, it could be helpful as you wouldn’t have to carry a phone."
AppleWatch,ffayog3,t3_eslq8l,1579747551.0,Doesn’t sound like a good idea!
Twitter,ffayk4k,t3_eslwax,1579747471.0,Glad it’s not just me!  Been wondering where all this garbage is coming from.
AppleWatch,ff7xc4q,t3_es4cn0,1579660586.0,Happened to me tonight when I tried to set up a replacement 4th Gen watch.  I restarted the watch & then the phone & was able to set up & pair the watch successfully.
cats,ff7x2mb,t3_es4egz,1579660405.0,So sweet!  Hope you feel better soon!
