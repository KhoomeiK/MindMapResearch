""Authoritarianism"" is used in the neutral context all the time. The most common form of the ""political compass"" will have one axis dedicated to authoritarianism, and the other axis dedicated to left/right. It doesn't have to do with good or evil, and it doesn't have to do with left or right, it simply has to do with the degree to which you'd like the state to take an active part in pursuing an objective.

So things like feminism and social justice in the *modern* sense would not fall under liberalism. Earlier movements of feminism and the Civil Rights movements were absolutely liberal, because they were looking to allow women and minorities equality under the law and economic access to markets. Modern social justice is about collectivization of identity by racial/gender/economic status and fundamentally rejects individualism. Modern social justice is about seeking specific economic outcomes by these group identities. The assertion that women should earn as much as men, for example, would be an illiberal assertion, because it is collectivizing men and women and searching for an arbitrary economic objective.

Art,fel1yd7,t1_fel02cs,1579212302.0,"Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet."

But there is a reason that every single flourishing state is a free market economy, and it is in large part precisely because of its resistance to cronyism. Cronyism is clearly not a feature of either capitalism or socialism, but the power of a state in a capitalist economy can be orders of magnitude smaller than the minimum state necessary to maintain a socialist economy, so there is the capability for far diminished cronyism."

What you're talking about with companies controlling entire markets and stifling competition within the markets themselves is monopolistic/anti-trust behavior. This can exist entirely independently of the state, and would only be crony capitalism in the case of an abusive collaboration with the state.

Crony capitalism has nothing to do with beginning or late stage capitalism, it is simply a reflection of how much capitalist entities have to gain from seeking corrupt relationships with the state, and to what degree the political system allows for it (citizens united, lobbying, etc). None of that has to do with free markets/capitalism, but are reflections of the power and structure of the state."
todayilearned,fdmfu0v,t1_fdlxmob,1578548485.0,"No, it's not. Capitalism can exist perfectly fine with minimal to no state at all, in fact that is what *most* capitalist entities engaging in crony capitalism actually pay off politicians to *do* (lower taxes and deregulate, minimizing state power).

Late stage capitalism has all sorts of negative inevitabilities, like the diminishing capability of people to contribute meaningful value to a market in the face of hyper-optimization and automation. That is an inevitability. Cronyism is not required at all, it's just highly likely to occur in the cases where the wealthy have anything to gain from interacting with the political system, and the political system itself allows it to occur (citizens united, etc)."

In regards to private companies building roads wherever they'd like, that's not how private property works. Do they own the land? They can build roads wherever they'd like on their own property, sure.

There's also the matter of negative third party externalities. Free market advocates want people to be free to do what they want, and be able to engage in transactions by terms agreed to by all parties involved, but acknowledge that there is a role for the state to intervene in the case wherein you are impacting unconsenting third-parties. If I run a factory that spews excessive carbon emissions, that affects parties that have not necessarily transacted with me, or in any way consented to my behavior.

So, no, I'm not conflating anything. Corrupt politicians are not unique to capitalism, they exist in every political system. The purest capitalists, the libertarian type, simply tend to want to limit the degree to which corruption can even take place, because they consistently want to limit the power of the state altogether.

politics,fdjfg3a,t1_fdiwt24,1578468532.0,"Basically, because very few libertarians believe in the total erradication of the state, or a 100% unobstructed free market.

Most libertarians like me are actually more correctly classified as ""liberals,"" but in the US that word simply doesn't mean what it actually means.

So to answer your question, UBI definitely **is** antithetical to libertarian ideology, but it's a favorable concession to make regarding one of the new perverse elements of free markets: the erradication of jobs to technology/automation. Free markets only make sense so long as people can actually provide value to one another, and the hard reality is that technology is constantly raising the minimum barrier to entry for people to provide any utility. If 15 million transportation jobs go out the window, those people aren't just going to be able to be useful. Some are, but it's clear where this is headed.

So for a libertarian, what is the solution? Government bureaucracies micromanaging the relations between individuals? State run businesses? Incompetent officials making high level decisions regarding what should be done and by who? No. We like markets, we like people being able to do what they want, and the things that get done being rewarded by the weighted input of the people they willingly transact with. So UBI doesn't sound so bad. If you're gonna give people something, give them money and let them choose what they want for themselves. Hopefully out gives them the freedom to pursue areas where they can still provide value to other people, but if they don't, at the very least at least they're still spending money and dictating what products and services should succeed with they own dollars, rather than a state coming to intervene and make these decisions on their behalf."

That being said, I think it enters the realm of being willfully obtuse if we pretend like there is no weighted anchor points for the concepts of masculinity and feminity. Take the pool of all men and all women, and overlap their similarities, leaving out the areas where the populations tend to differ. The areas where men tend to differ from women and women tend to differ from men, across the population at large, are definitionally what masculine and feminine traits would be defined as.

So having a high pitched voice doesn't mean you're not a man, but that doesn't mean that a high pitched voice isn't a feminine trait, because it is. There is nothing wrong with that. Individuals are made up of all sorts of characteristics that make them unique, and that's perfectly fine. Some women have facial hair, a masculine trait, and that's fine.

I have worked for people and have had people work for me, at no point in that process has there been a violation of consent. I currently choose to work for someone, because they had an idea I liked and were willing to give me what I asked for in exchange for my labor. Likewise, I have a personal project I have been working on on the side that I just hired my own engineers to help with. Nobody in this entire process is facing a violation of consent, but there are clearly hierarchies in place.

What you describe as a ""just"" hierarchy is an example of a free market decision. When a building needs to be built, they hire an architect to design it, an engineer to review it, construction workers to build it. That is simply people freely associating among themselves; free market capitalism. That is how the vast majority of the world operates. Who gets to work in Facebook servers? Competent engineers. Who gets to be your pilot? Competent pilots. These all exist within hierarchies formed entirely of people freely associating with each other. What you are proposing is either exactly what already exists in a capitalist society, or you are proposing that there exist some governing body that is constantly evaluating the nature of people's relationships with each other, that this bridge builder is more qualified than this other, and that certain arrangements are not just, irrespective of how the individuals involved have chosen to characterize the nature of their own arrangements.

Your example of an ""unjust"" hierarchy is literally just an example of political corruption, which has absolutely nothing to do with capitalism, communism, anarchism, or any other political or economic system. You think democracies are incapable of corruption? Do you think they're incapable of authoritarianism?

This is where libertarians and anarchists agree, right? They both think of the state as a highly corruptible entity which is actually capable of violating consent. I, a libertarian (I'm actually a liberal, but bear with me), agree that this is something we should attempt to minimize. But where I disagree with an anarchist is what to do from here. An anarchist is deeply concerned with outcomes, and ensuring that no individual is capable of gaining an advantage over another along any hierarchy. And the degree to which this is not true is the degree to which they're simply not an anarchist, and actually just a libertarian. But because the anarchist is so concerned with the way society is ultimately structured, they invariably end up describing a political structure that is highly authoritarian.

In the simplest terms, so long as I am able to own what I produce and freely associate with people, I am going to amass several advantages over the average person. If you want to prevent this from happening, you need a system of governance that prevents me from owning what I produce or freely associating, or you are a libertarian. That's it."

politics,fdeuj2g,t1_fdecopr,1578346887.0,"From Anarchy Works, a perfect example of why anarchism is the most self-contradictory nonsense available:

>All people deserve the freedom to define and organize themselves on their own terms. Decision-making structures should be horizontal rather than vertical

They literally say that you have the freedom to define and organize themselves on their own terms (which is what capitalism is), and then **immediately** say that structures must be horizontal rather than vertical. Capitalism *actually* lets you organize yourself along your own terms, which is why you have worker co-ops, Mondragon, mom and pop shops, contractors, consultants, employees, partners, however the fuck you want to structure your relationships with other people. It is *actually* a state-less, mandate-less philosophy that only requires that you adhere to the contracts you agree to with other parties. Anarchism, on the other hand, claims to be state-less and yet invariably insists on the structure of the arrangements people are capable of forming within themselves.

Mind you, not only is anarchism insanely authoritarian in this regard, but their claims that they can eliminate hierarchies is **NOT POSSIBLE**. Who gets to live on the California coastline? Not everybody who wants to, can, so how is it resolved? Who gets to date the most attractive people? Who gets to partner with the most intelligent people to collaborate on projects? Those projects will consistently be more desirable to more people. Whoever benefits from all forms of inherent privileges naturally has immense power over other people, completely independent of the economic system. If I build a house and am particularly good at it, am I allowed to own it? Can anybody just come in and live in my house? Am I allowed to trade it? If the answer to all of this is a populist direct democracy, why is the assumption that this necessarily results in just and free outcomes, and what are the precise logistics of this? If there is some legal concept that entitles me to have some semblance of ownership over the things I make, at what point does this fail to definitionally fit your notion of anarchism and simply turn into a free market (which is clearly capable of immediately producing hierarchies)? Or is who gets to live where simply something that is voted on, leading to the highest resolution bureaucratic nightmare of a popularity contest dictating who gets to do what?

The only way any of this is ever laid out is in the vaguest of terms, that when examined in any level of specificity, reveals what is clearly an authoritarian nightmare that accomplishes none of the things it claims it can do. And the degree to which it can actually eliminate hierarchies, the greater degree of authoritarianism and diminishing personal liberty."

Okay, get rid of money. I trade a chicken for your basket. The next day you want another chicken but I don't want another basket, I want a fish. You go to the next village, trade for a fish, and come back to get a chicken from me. At a certain point we all want to be able to trade with each other without having to have exactly the end product we each want, so we rely on some intermediate abstraction. A paper IOU that's just an arbitrary abstraction of value. As long as it's verifiably scarce, as any legitimate currency is, we know that we can use it to hold value. So we start trading fish, baskets, chickens for IOUs, and eventually we arrive at an accurately priced abstraction of value stored in the form of IOUs.
