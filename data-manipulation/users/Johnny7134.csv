todayilearned,fenfq8i,t3_eq2u0o,1579283713.0,Oh yeah? Bet you this study didn't look at Aborigines.
todayilearned,fcw7tu4,t3_ej3wsi,1578019131.0,"Yep this is propaganda that misrepresents the actual story.

Lost of people buy into it because it's put forth in schools, sad really that these people twist facts."
HighQualityGifs,fcv3ido,t1_fcuxome,1577993891.0,"Vader is stronger than Anakin mate.

He hunted down many Jedi after Order 66, even taking on multiple masters/knights at the same time, not every Jedi died after Order 66, so Vader was tasked with hunting them down.

Vader isn't weak, he's just weaker than he should be because of his injuries. The Force seems to work the opposite of real life, the older you are typically the stronger you are. (Yoda, Palpatine)

If Anakin is at 100, Vader is at 150, Palpatine was hoping for a 250 though."
