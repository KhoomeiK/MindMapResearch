AmItheAsshole,fefgyao,t1_fee0rl2,1579056102.0,"Also female checking in. I've been seeing a male gynecologist for years now, currently pregnant and still seeing a male doctor, and a male doctor will be delivering our baby and my husband has never had a problem with it. I can't imagine the kind of mental gymnastics it takes to think there's anything sexual about a pelvic exam."
AmItheAsshole,feenudy,t1_fee1poi,1579037530.0,My first thought was that this guy should befriend poop knife guy. I fucking love reddit.
AmItheAsshole,fdoc5d7,t1_fdo3smn,1578602503.0,We have 3 cats and 2 dogs and I'm literally never in a room of our house without at least 2 or 3 of them. That's the entire point of having a companion animal as a pet.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdgwmbz,t1_fdgukdc,1578410138.0,"I never said it was an excuse not to cut them, just that you don't know anything about this dog or their owner lol. This isn't really worth arguing, I hope you have a great day!"
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdgthkv,t1_fdgtdyj,1578407913.0,I'm aware. Ours was a rescue and her nails were atrocious when we adopted her. They've definitely gotten shorter over time but they're still insanely long even with a year of regular clipping.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdgsz2j,t1_fdgrslw,1578407534.0,"She could also just have really long quicks though. We have a pit mix who we can only trim her nails so short without nipping her and making her bleed, and even clipping them as short as we can they still look really long and unmanaged."
educationalgifs,fct21fe,t1_fct0yhu,1577930835.0,20 weeks here and I just started feeling human again a week or two ago.
AmItheAsshole,fch4g66,t1_fch4bwu,1577647213.0,It's an 09 and it's a great car. Thanks!
AmItheAsshole,fch23i5,t1_fch0ipk,1577646546.0,"That's all great if you have plenty of money and aren't 17. Your every day vehicle owner doesn't typically buy a car for an exorbitant amount of money to commute in. I didn't write anything off, but for the majority of people, cars depreciate quickly. You're talking about a large minority."
AmItheAsshole,fcgv1xm,t1_fcgisi9,1577644283.0,Cars are never really an investment to begin with because of how rapidly they devalue. I doubt we will ever own a brand new vehicle and I'm fine with buying 2-3 year old ones with low mileage. I bought an 09 Civic in 2012 and drove it until this fall when we bought a 2017 Rav4 (and only did this because my husband's car was totaled). We still have the Civic and it's my husband's daily driver now.
BabyBumps,fc3syba,t3_efyzmt,1577397828.0,I lived off of toast and plain pasta with butter and salt from weeks 9 till about 15. 19 weeks on Saturday and things are much better these days. You can do it!
