I’ve personally never gone to a puppy class by a real company (aka not Petsmart) where the attendees legitimately didn’t know how to teach their dog to sit. Most people in the class already knew sit, but it’s about getting all the pups to listen and focus while around a bunch of other pups."
reactivedogs,ffpen0c,t1_ffkbj4p,1580093140.0,"Sorry but I wouldn’t say anything if I were you. I cannot believe commenters are even advising you say something. you have no idea if it was even the groomer that said something. You even admit it could have been the other lady. 

You are literally making mountains out of nonexistent mole hills. 

I understand anxiety sucks but you should not try to ruin other peoples livelihoods for something that you don’t have a clear grasp on. 

Unless you are 100% certain that it was the groomer talking, and that they were talking about you, reporting this would just make you a giant asshole."
