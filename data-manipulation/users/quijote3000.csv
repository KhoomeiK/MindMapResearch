Then I heard a shot. Number 4 was killed and number 7 assumed command in the radio. Then I heard another shot. Nobody talked in the radio. Suddenly I was alone.

I was told how worthless I was and I  believed it. It took until I reached 9th grade for me to become more  confident, but I carried that experience with me. Cut to freshman year  of college when my first love cheated on me with my childhood friend and  neither would admit it, until I called my childhood friend on it 22  years later.

Rasputin. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori\_Rasputin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Rasputin)  Sure, he was kind of ass, he eventually caused the fall of the popularity of the russian imperial family, which eventually brought Lenin and Stalin

But, oh, how he died.

After Rasputin recovered from the by-all-accounts gnarly stab wound  delivered by the prostitute, a group of Russian nobles decided to finish  the job by poisoning him to death with tainted wine and cake.

So, Rasputin continued to hang out, eating cake, until one of the  nobles finally grew impatient and shot Rasputin in the back. Content  that he was dead, the murderers left the palace. One member of the party  forgot his coat though, and when he returned to collect it, Rasputin  sprang up from the floor like Skeet Ulrich in *Scream* and started strangling him.

The others arrived in time to shoot Rasputin three more times in the back, dropping him to the floor. But was he dead? *Fuck no*. He was still struggling to stand, so the conspirators clubbed the everloving shit out of him.

They wrapped Rasputin's body in a sheet and dumped him in the  freezing Neva River. When they found Rasputin's body later, riddled with  poison, gunshot holes and club wounds, they determined he had died... *of hypothermia*.

It was evident the bastard had managed to partially claw his way out  of his wrappings, and if he had done it a few minutes faster, he  probably would have wound up on the assassins' doorstep, dripping wet  and pissed off."
