minipainting,ffc2xlh,t1_ffc2rm9,1579790220.0,"Most primers have a formula that bonds to the surface - especially those by GW - those stick to the models and are nearly impossible to rub off. 

I personally enjoy Army Painter black/grey/white primers myself, during the warmer months."
minipainting,ffc22us,t3_ests0b,1579789591.0,"You noted above, it just gives your paint a better surface to adhere to. 

Also, priming white when using bright colors is a must, as the translucence of paint needs a brighter layer underneath. Using black or grey will mute those colors a lot."
