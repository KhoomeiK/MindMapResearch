The moral hazard in delusion is arrogance- the idea that our world model is superior to someone else’s. It might be a better (more truthful, more useful, more beneficial) but to be ethical we need to be continually asking “could I be wrong”. In denying flat earth theory, or antivaxxers, we’ve looked carefully at the world and verified that our model is reasonably accurate. We can be grateful for what we do know as well as being grateful for what we don’t. The moral hazard happens when we start to claim a certainty that we’re not entitled to. 

Regarding number 3- denial- is (I think) what is meant by “militant ignorance”. From my own experience the times whenever I’ve fucked up *really* badly I sometimes knew what I was doing was wrong but did it anyway. 

Part 1 of the denial process is an active blindness to the consequences of our behavior to ourselves or others. It’s a refusal to think about them.
