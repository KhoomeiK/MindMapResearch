ireland,ffwe4cd,t3_evkdqv,1580297450.0,"To me it's fine if a person does it so long as they move it without fuss when you ask. I travel a *lot*. Buses rarely have adequate luggage racks, and keeping your bag on your lap or at your feet is a pain in the hole, especially if it's heavy. You also want to keep it near if it's got valuable stuff in it.

The only unacceptable part is if the person was to show any resentment in moving the bag.

To me the worst people are the ones who sit on the outside seat to block access to the window seat on regional busses. When the bus starts moving they change to the window seat. Their plan was to sit alone all along. They were just seat blocking. And when you ask if the window seat is available they just resignedly move over to the window instead of letting you in: they wanted that seat all along."

As audio is getting as far as the software output on reaper - the master fader - there must be something not right from that point onwards until it hits your ears: Incorrect outputs selected in reaper, incorrect settings in Focusrite Software, driver not working, headphones/speakers connected to the wrong hardware output, broken cable, broken headphones,.....mmm...you've gone deaf?

How is your audio output hooked up? Speakers? Headphones? Where are they connected to? Can you post a screenshot of your audio settings in Reaper?

Have you got the latest drivers installed?

Have you got Focusrite Control installed and configured correctly?

Have you looked at YouTube videos on installing and using Focusrite interfaces with Reaper such as this:?

Have you followed this Focusrite guide to Reaper? https://support.focusrite.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207546025-Reaper-setup-guide

Have you contacted Focusrite support as it suggests you do on the bottom of that page?

Have you followed along with any ""Your first song in Reaper"" tutorials in YouTube?"
AskReddit,ffvk2xj,t1_ffvgpk8,1580265972.0,"Which one? If you're referring to the Bible, there is almost literally nothing in the historical record that supports any of the events described in the Bible, and literally nothing in the historical record that supports any of it's supernatural claims. At best, the Bible is a book that was begun to be written 30 years after the events that it claims to report, that contains no eyewitness testimony, only reports of what the early adapters of this religion *said* that the eye witnesses said. I know you probably be trollin', but for those that don't realise that..."
