MechanicAdvice,fg0lbk1,t1_fg0jp4q,1580410099.0,"Definitely, cars are designed to take the brunt of an impact. It's quite worrying how much damage you can do in a low speed bump. 

Years ago in my first car I had a 15/20 mph head on with a much larger car on a blind corner. Drove home thinking everything was fine. When I tried to start her up again she wouldn't turn over, had the car recovered to a garage and on inspection I had bent the chassis and the whole engine was shifted on its mounts.

Stay safe and hopefully it's just cosmetic damage."
