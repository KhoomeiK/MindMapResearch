redditsings,ffj1wzr,t1_ffj1riu,1579988327.0,"So now laws against hate speech are bad and not just the other hypothetical laws they might lead to? So the problem is *not* that it's a slippery slope, even though you argued so twice? Just give up man lmao"
redditsings,ffj0xvc,t1_ffj0dtd,1579987621.0,"Yeah, you're saying that laws against spreading nazi ideology is bad because you think it will probably possibly lead to other bad laws in the future. That's literally what you're saying, that's what *if you do this then you go down a slippery slope means*, that's what *give them an inch they will take a mile* means: you are saying that the government preventing widespread and hate and violence against minorities by controlling a specific type of speech(which you think is bad, right? right? right?) will lead to bad things in the future, that's what you are saying lmao

I don't think it will but if we get a fascist regime and a second holocaust(that's the worst case scenario, right? right?) as a direct consequence of cracking down on nazi speech and not that because of widespread hate against minorities then feel free to in that hypothetical future track me down and say *I told you so*."
redditsings,ffj07zu,t1_ffizz90,1579987098.0,"So you aren't arguing against laws that prohibit hate speech by themselves, you're really against the further oppressive laws that you think will logically follow? Because that's what ""slippery slope"" means my dude."
redditsings,ffizfpg,t1_ffiz7io,1579986525.0,"So you agree that laws against hate speech itself are good, since you say that spreading hateful ideologies is bad, just that it's a slippery slope that will give the governments of the world free passes to pass any oppressive laws they want?"
redditsings,ffiymrr,t1_ffiydw5,1579985940.0,"Fascism suppresses opposition to the regime, not ethnic majorities oppression of minorities.

Like dang calm down, you don't have to get that offended just because I think that spreading hateful ideologies such as nazism is bad."
redditsings,ffiy8dk,t1_ffiy1dx,1579985652.0,"Yes, the thing that we should definitely learn from the Nazi regime is definitely that turning people on minorities and giving fascism a platform to spread and grow hate against them can never ever go wrong. That is definitely the anti-fascist way to go about it, for everyone who cares about peoples' equal rights to life and safety no matter their ethnicity, religion or sexuality."
redditsings,ffixpy7,t1_ffiwtdb,1579985283.0,"So you don't support governments controlling hate speech against minorities because you think that protecting minorities will make the government suppress minorities? ok lmao

I think that systematic hate against minorities is a problem since it leads to systematic violence, and since I think that minorities safety is more important than nazis right to hate, oppress and target I think that we should prioritise that higher.

I don't know what to say, I'm just struggling to believe that you are genuinely against hate speech and are a champion and supporter of minority rights and just don't think that any courts of law should be able to decide what's illegal or not. You aren't morally obligated to defend nazis, and you certainly are not obligated to help them spread their ideology by giving them a platform.

I don't like checking peoples' profiles so I guess I'm just assuming that you're a genuine anti-nazi who is, as you say, regularily arguing against nazis to convince people that they are bad?"

redditsings,ffivz7d,t1_ffiv26z,1579984026.0,"Ah yes, the Nazis, famously known for suppressing hate speech and systematic oppression towards minorities. We can truly learn something from them about how to protect minorities from systematic and organised hate that leads to violence. After all, that's what they're known for fighting. They were most certainly known for never ever using hateful speech to turn people against vulnerable minorities, no sir.

Seriously though, do you disagree that regimes that use institutionalized violence against minorities and other violent hate groups use hate speech to turn people against minorities which leads to violence, or do you think that minorities rights to life, liberty and security of person are less important than those poor nazis' rights to dehumanize and attack them?"

Also, cishet people talk about things related to their sexuality all the time, but for people like OP it's only *shoving it in people's faces* when an lgbt person is doing it.

OP should put on some makeup and a dress for a week, and see how much people care about your gender and how much cis people care about their gender identity when it's actually being challenged."
