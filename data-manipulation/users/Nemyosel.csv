therewasanattempt,fe09oz7,t1_fe00o4q,1578807031.0,"r/antinatalism.

Pretty much every philosophy (besides optimism) and religion has concluded that life is suffering. If you're broke, your kid can't drive his own car, can't go to a doctor if he's sick, can't eat high quality food, etc. If you're rich, well, it is better but humans have a problem where if you get too comfortable, life becomes boring.

The rich are often seen as depressed or drug addicts or both. They are also suffering, even if it is 1/100 of what broke people experience. Life sucks for everyone.

Life is suffering. Especially now, life sucks and will very likely continue to suck. Bringing another human into this crappy planet is only to continue your legacy. Making someone else suffer so your name can live long after you die.

Think about it. Why have a child? To give the gift of life? Nope, life is no gift, and even if it is, why not give that gift to countless children and just breed humans all day if you're that selfless?"
