gadgets,ffitnm1,t1_ffinqmf,1579982435.0,That's why they should force all power bricks to comply to the USB Power Delivery protocol and have a USB-C output. No mandatory requirement on the cables. That's it. That solves everything.
gadgets,ffit7ho,t1_ffil6mw,1579982116.0,"This is stupid because it's a catchy headline. As you say, it's about chargers.

The problem is not with the iPhones but with the HUMONGOUS amount of micro usb, proprietary round chargers around.

Forcing everyone to use usb-c for charging is a nice idea to avoid an insane amount of plastic and electronics."

gadgets,ffisqna,t1_ffiducy,1579981778.0,"Maybe the US is a special case. If like to remember here that in many countries 1/10 of the people use an iPhone. In most cases 2/3 generations old iPhone. (I'm not talking about China uh? Take Germany or Spain as an example)

That means 3/100 people, maximum, will have a wireless charging phone.

Meaning, nobody will bloody care. And those 3% will not be able to charge their phone almost anywhere unless they carry around the damn wireless charger.

And let's remember, they will either carry a massive charger, or they'll carry a slow one. And it will be much slower than for everyone else anyway.

And even better. There's a really nice chance they carry around a MacBook, with a USB-C charger too. How bloody stupid would that be? I want to scratch my brain thinking in such infuriating situation."
gadgets,ffirvgi,t1_ffic8xz,1579981155.0,"Not a chance. Forcing people to carry around a wireless charger sounds suicidal. It means they can't even carry a usb-c to lightning adapter. It's bring the entire charger, or nothing. It's an instant ""do not buy"" point for me. Especially when EVERYONE else would have a compatible charger. Especially when a bloody SEVEN percent of the population has an iPhone in my country.

Because remember, this is a massive factor outside of the US. Maybe you all people use an iPhone, but if Apple goes wireless charging good luck trying to borrow a charger in the office/airport/train etc... In Germany, Spain, Italy... You are done 

 I can even charge my phone with a MacBook charger right now. How damn stupid is the situation???

Next iPhone will be USB-C, mark my words. Apple would be really really really stupid otherwise."
PS4,ffiq0if,t1_ffibvby,1579979848.0,"It's a matter of taste. Japanese have some WEIRD games we don't even see in our countries. But those are not in XBox. The exclusives in XBox are not very popular in Japan. And the rest of games run in a PS just fine.

So simply, why bother?"

Absolutely basic in the industry world. You just don't connect your billion dollar machines to the internet. Usually even pendrives are basically forbidden or under strict rules.

There are MASSIVE efforts by bad actors out there to sabotage or highjack industrial equipment.

Bloody hell, they even got a worm to destroy 20% of the gas centrifuges in the nuclear plants of Iran spinning them out of control. No clue how much did that cost but the damage was massive."
