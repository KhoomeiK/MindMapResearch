It was a new gym with an experienced coach who started up a gym out of nowhere; before that there was only the YMCA.  The head coach started offering some of the gymnasts about my age ""sports massages"" and it seemed creepy and wrong, though perhaps not illegal (still, it's a position of power).

But then rumors started up about younger kids, and soon after the coach and his wife packed up the whole gym and left.  I always wondered what exactly happened, and if they just moved on to a new town and started up again.

Then the Larry Nasser thing came up, which was just shocking.  To see it at such a high level, and covered up for so long.

The issue is that clinical study registration is absolutely required if you ever want to publish something, even things well below what the FDA wants to hear about.

We attempted a small open label pilot study at my institution using an approved drug for a new indication.  IRB approval was obtained, and an IND was not required as it was too small for any future approvals or practice changes (so no FDA reporting).

Goal was 12 patients.  Only managed to recruit 3, and time /funding ran out.

No one was going to make any strong conclusion off of 12, and you can't really make *anything* out of 3.  But we had to report it, and it took months.  Every secondary endpoint ever mentioned in the protocol needed reporting, with endless queries about the results.  One exploratory endpoint turned out to not even be possible to measure due to a change in what the clinical lab could do, and they wanted us to amend the protocol (in the IRB ) for this over and done study to make the results consistent with the official protocol.

>OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety of abortion compared with childbirth.

>METHODS: We estimated mortality rates associated with live births and legal induced abortions in the United States in 1998-2005. We used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, birth certificates, and Guttmacher Institute surveys. In addition, we searched for population-based data comparing the morbidity of abortion and childbirth.

>RESULTS: The pregnancy-associated mortality rate among women who delivered live neonates was 8.8 deaths per 100,000 live births. The mortality rate related to induced abortion was 0.6 deaths per 100,000 abortions. In the one recent comparative study of pregnancy morbidity in the United States, pregnancy-related complications were more common with childbirth than with abortion.

>CONCLUSION: Legal induced abortion is markedly safer than childbirth. The risk of death associated with childbirth is approximately 14 times higher than that with abortion. Similarly, the overall morbidity associated with childbirth exceeds that with abortion."
