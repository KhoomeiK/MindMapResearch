I know right now is awful but speaking from experience it does get easier. One of the most eye opening things I ever read was that grief is like a box with a ball and a pain button. At first, the ball is huge and fills the box constantly hitting the pain button. Over time the ball shrinks but still bounces around and every so often triggers the pain. You never forget but you do learn to keep going."
