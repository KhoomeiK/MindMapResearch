CasualConversation,ffd8778,t3_esux4p,1579815313.0,"Me too! Whenever someone talks to me about their pet, especially children, I always ask its name. I also love the evolution a pet name can have as the nicknames start to morph it into something totally new."
happy,ffch580,t1_ffak7hr,1579799354.0,You might be right. I personally don't have much experience with jealousy and I'm thankful for that. I've seen people ruin their lives over it but I just haven't felt that feeling before. Maybe a little envy but only so much that I am motivated to work harder or change the direction of my focus towards achieving something similar.
happy,ffcgucx,t1_ffb8nb0,1579799168.0,Thank you for your kind words. Working for our rewards is sweeter! I think we appreciate it more in the end.
happy,ffcgs80,t1_ffc5n22,1579799131.0,So sorry to hear you've had such a bad day. I hope today is looking better for you!
relationship_advice,ff6tc30,t1_ff6l10j,1579634460.0,She was 17 when she started the lie. A LOT of teenage girls lie. She did come clean as she's matured. We should at the very least give her that. He wasn't asking questions and she could have kept it up until it was time to get that marriage license.  Not defending her - just saying... she was a kid.
relationship_advice,ff6t58b,t1_ff6rbdd,1579634349.0,You think so until it happens to you. I was the opposite and always looked younger than I was but all my friends looked like they were in their 20's instead of teens. And this was before girls were actively trying to look older.
relationship_advice,ff6frfq,t3_erxewl,1579626234.0,"It is creepy, yes. You have every right in the world to be pissed off and to even end the relationship if you want to. However, there is now a child in the picture. I assume she's keeping it as you mentioned her wanting to conceive. That means, if you want to be a part of your child's life, then she is also going to be a part of your life for the duration of your life. Honestly, a lot of people have ""How we got together"" stories that they may not be proud of and choose not to share. If you love her and end up wanting to forgive her and continue life with her as you had previously planned - you can also choose to do so and there's nothing wrong with that. You do not have to share your age gap with anyone. People may judge, but they judge anyway (and for far stupider reasons) and that's not a reason to stop living your life the way that makes you the happiest. If you love her and she makes you happy and you get along then do what you want. Time heals and you shouldn't hate yourself or find yourself disgusting because you didn't know. This is not your fault so you should not carry those feelings with you. If you set the lie aside how do you feel about her as a person?"
relationship_advice,ff6exxf,t3_ertsws,1579625721.0,"This guy is not a keeper. He's so immature and it doesn't seem like he thinks of women as real human beings. Unless he gets a total re-education on how to treat you like an actual person with feelings and needs I would end it. And I wouldn't pull the whole, it's me not your thing. It's him - and this is why we're over. He can't even stand to hear the word Yeast Infection?! Forget about asking him to pick up any tampons or go with you to any appointments should you decide to have children!"
relationship_advice,ff5vrru,t3_errja4,1579611919.0,"You may love him, but the feeling is not mutual. If he loved you he would have stopped the moment you said owch. You may not want to leave him but he is not who you think he is, so how can you really love him? Have some self respect and leave this asshole so you can find someone who will treat you like a human being and not a sex toy."
relationship_advice,ff3tun2,t3_eregee,1579548726.0,Do not have kids with her. Maybe it's the optimist in me but this doesn't mean that YOU HAVE to leave her. Answer her ultimatum that you are not going to have children and that you're sorry. The ball is now in her court. Would she truly rather have children and lose you in the process? That's up to her. There's a small chance that she might reconsider when she really thinks about life without you in it.
relationships,feogcjq,t1_fenqx9l,1579299754.0,So you're not allowed to be a whole person since you are a mother? This guy's ignorance is overwhelming.
relationships,feofh3m,t3_eq31jc,1579299464.0,"My stepdad used to do this every single day after work. He'd be in there for like an hour! I mean, at least he was scheduling it so we all knew what to expect when he got home and could use the bathroom before he got home. I would bet he's just using the bathroom to have some quiet alone time. Maybe you could have a chat where you insinuate that if he needs some alone man time during the day he could do so in your bedroom instead so that the toilet isn't off-limits for so long. Maybe as soon as he gets out of the bathroom after one of his long sessions you could just say hey, if you need some alone time I hope you know you can always just go hang out in our bedroom. Just let me know so I don't bother you."
relationship_advice,feoe5cc,t1_fenxx7k,1579298894.0,"I want to disagree with the second option but I can't. I would absolutely do the ""hey, it was great to meet you and I hate to cut things short but we have plans this afternoon. Maybe we can plan a gaming get together sometime soon."" I wouldn't go with the surprise option because it's not a surprise. This is a trip you and your boyfriend planned and you'd like to get on with the original itinerary. Nothing wrong with that. Unless the surprise activity you have planned is a full-on fight LOL! Honestly, though, you keep saying that you wanted to enjoy this trip, etc, etc, but is that even possible at this point? Has his lie by omission and this awkward tag-along session completely left you with a bad taste in your mouth? Are you even going to be able to enjoy a single second of this trip now? He needs to be told just how royally he screwed this up for you so that he doesn't make that mistake a second time (provided you continue to see him)."
relationships,feo0hsk,t3_eq08uz,1579293506.0,"This happened to my MIL's best friend. She married my FIL's brother after dating for 2 years. She'd just gotten out of an abusive marriage and they were attached at the hip for those 2 years. You never saw one without the other. After the vows, we all started hearing insane stories about how he won't pay for anything even though he owns his own business and makes bank. He instead gives it all to his ungrateful daughter and her wife, who are perfectly capable people. He destroys anything nice she buys including the outdoor building. He threw spaghetti all over the ceiling and walls in one of his many outrageous temper tantrums 15 minutes before all their friends were supposed to show up. The list goes on. 

Get out before you end up worse off."
internetparents,fel429z,t3_epnxl1,1579213610.0,"Moving out sounds like the best option in my opinion. You have a safe place to be and a child on the way then you need to prioritize the safety of your child. While it remains inside you that means you have to prioritize your own safety. The stress alone from remaining in such a hostile environment while pregnant cannot be a healthy choice for your baby. Being a new mom is going to be hard enough so start making decisions now that will make your life easier moving forward. You cannot make anyone else happy, only yourself. You cannot control or change the way others think or see you. You can only control your own perception. Do what makes you happy and safe. 

That being said, maybe moving out and giving your parents some space will also give them a change in perspective. If they learn that by treating you and your family like shit that they won't see you or be able to control you, then maybe they will change their tune. They have a grandchild on the way! This is happy news and they should be excited to be as involved as you will allow. If they aren't then don't have them around. Endings are hard and mostly painful, but in order for you to start this new chapter, you have to close out the old one."

relationship_advice,fcvh95p,t3_eiyhsn,1578002050.0,"If no one has told you yet, please check out the Keto diet. I literally lost 20 lbs sitting on the couch last winter. Doesn't matter what diet you try, losing weight is one of the hardest things ever. This diet is literally saving lives and I know that from my own personal experience I feel a million times better (because isn't that the real reason to lose weight). Good luck and I hope this year brings you joy, happiness and self love!"
