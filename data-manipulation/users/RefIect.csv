LegendsOfRuneterra,ffh5nvh,t3_etddsm,1579923795.0,It is progressive because gay people exist? It's literally a fantasy world why would a fantasy world have the same hang ups about that kind of stuff as we do ?
LegendsOfRuneterra,ffh50dv,t3_eta6ma,1579923284.0,The entire deck building UI needs to be tweaked and made more user friendly. I'm sure riot is on it. At the moment it's very unintuitive

leagueoflegends,ffas43b,t3_esf4wk,1579743201.0,"Considering there are over one thousand people in the class action I understand how it could be 400 million; especially if an employee worked there for 5 years, lost wages and was sexually harassed during that time I could see how they could be owed upwards of half a mil for their trouble. Thing is, it also stunts you for the rest of your career having to accept a low salary for so long as well as never being promoted due to sex. So not sure if half a mill is even enough"

AnnieMains,ff750bi,t3_er7biv,1579641244.0,"CSing ""perfectly"" (getting at least 85% cs)  for the first 10 minutes will get you a completed lueden's echo  with 0 kills, which will make you able to clear waves quickly for the rest of the game and thus increase your cs for the rest of the game, so focus hard on getting good at csing for the first 10 mins"
leagueoflegends,ff727lp,t3_erv0by,1579639646.0,Gag for the taste. Yay for LCS getting a big brand sponsorship <3
LegendsOfRuneterra,ff56q6r,t3_erba6v,1579581817.0,I don’t see how owning all the cards puts you at an advantage against someone who only bought the most op deck at the moment. We want to be able to try all the decks for fun not because we want to win with our wallets. I don’t even want to grind out the cards through normal means because I get bored of one deck far too quickly. We also want to support the game and keep it free for everyone. Cosmetics are not really something I’d purchase for legends of runeterra anyways I don’t see the point unless it’s extremely high quality and immersive (which they aren’t from what we’ve been shown)

exercisepostures,fescz8n,t3_edj4xh,1579363978.0,Everyone having their little critiques but this is an amazing feat. It’s more of a mental win to me than physical. You disciplined yourself to do something challenging every day for a month. Good work !
science,femjiht,t3_epvwk7,1579258776.0,"The act of observing the particles is what causes them to be ""entangled"". Like the process used to determine if its up or down causes the supposed ""entanglement"" that spans across time and space. Much less remarkable"

books,fe1ps33,t3_engjt3,1578829471.0,I didn’t like how the characters (who are children) had the thoughts and skills of adults; they didn’t seem like children to me and were both Mary Sues types just inherently good at everything they did. The third book is my favorite

leagueoflegends,fdpzhof,t3_emnkcz,1578647368.0,"It’s easy if you’re smurfing, which is a pitfall a lot of coaches and content creators fall into. They fail to see the game from the perspective of a silver player who actually is silver skill wise trying to climb. Saying things like “it’s so simple just do x” are really not helpful. Study some champions, learn more about the game (talking about how waves push, spawn timers, wards, etc). Take notes during the games or after. Most importantly protect your mind and if you’re getting emotional during a game (rage / tilted) you need to use logic instead. Those are the advices I like to hear from coaches more"

leagueoflegends,fdpyqss,t3_emnkxs,1578646355.0,Same is happening to me: what I have resorted to is playing 1 game of support then 2 of mid. After you play support you can’t be auto filled. I just play brand support and do tons of dmg while trying to ward and I’ve actually learned a bit more about support doing this (still a lot to learn)

leagueoflegends,fcl2gxs,t3_ehpv2w,1577738368.0,I think this is why Riot stopped doing ranked rewards - they realize they just aren't good at clothing / textiles.

akalimains,fcaz0li,t1_fcayio2,1577579418.0,"I’m not saying you did but using this an example of bad creep block is not great. This is an excellent example of why creep block is in the game. You dashed into Darius pull with 2 low hp ally minions. After they die the only thing the minions will target is you. You were also up against a wall. The melee minions will not move because you’re right in front of them, so you’re blocked in. You could have flashed but I’m assuming you didn’t have it. Creep block isn’t unreasonable in this situation. Working as intended."
