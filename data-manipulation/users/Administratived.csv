I’m thinking about doing miracle noodles (angel hair style) with 1 tbsp butter, parsley, crushed garlic, basil, and oregano in a pan with a side spinach salad, but the noodles might be a mega letdown. Any experiences?"

Other than that, got right back on the wagon after a big binge last week and so far so good! I did end up eating dinner that night and calling the day a wash, but I stopped bingeing."
fatlogic,feo5ahp,t1_feo54vc,1579295346.0,That actually makes me feel better and puts things in perspective. I’ll take the hit as 1280 because that’s what it felt like volume wise

I just want to hit myself. Hard."
fatlogic,fenixob,t1_fendd4t,1579285682.0,Everyone should keep track regardless of anything imo. In my “recovery” for an ED (I didn’t have an ED but was falsely diagnosed) I didn’t weigh myself for three months and gained 5 lbs. I now weigh more than is appropriate for my frame and carry a decent pot belly. All because weighing myself and tracking calories was the devil according to my doctor.

I got really into weight loss and healthy living in college and became just slightly underweight.

To an extent. I am reaping a much vaster net gain by losing faster. And I overindulged previously which has led to this issue in the first place. So it’s time for discipline.

I’m thinking a 300 cal lunch and 900 cal dinner might not be a bad compromise though. Small meals leave me constantly hungry though."
