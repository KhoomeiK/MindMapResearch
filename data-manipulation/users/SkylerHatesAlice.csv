>it seems like the employer’s belief in God has lead to a positive action

That's like almost saying ""I need a God to tell me not to be a dick"". Like you're admitting you have to be told to be a good person if you're going to be a good person, for some reason you just can't be good. Doing XYZ ""because God told me to"" is usually reserved for crazy people."

Not supposed to say anything and 2. Call the police. In fact I'm almost 100% sure that's how every job I've worked has been, you do not interact with the customer.

Reason being they don't want employees fighting a customer over a misunderstanding. No actual company will defend their employee touching a customer just because ""but but but he started it"""
