Buttcoin,ffvbi3s,t1_ffv3gb3,1580260214.0,Oh sure.  But the only real use case for crypto is crime. For everything else blockchain is totally unnecessary or makes the process near unusable.
Buttcoin,ffvbatn,t1_ffuwywz,1580260080.0,I'd say you got about 60% right
Buttcoin,ffv9fzx,t1_fftfr9l,1580258832.0,And u/kellysmith vanished into thin air. Not a big fan of nuance and actual thoughtful discussion
Buttcoin,ffuc3uj,t1_ffu7bhk,1580238845.0,"Bahaha you just did it again.  Now you're talking about email and livestreaming.  

You're a member of the pyramid scheme.  That makes it your pyramid scheme.  You need an absolutely massive amount of new recruits to buy out the current crop of bagholders."
Buttcoin,ffu5uir,t1_ffu4mj2,1580235128.0,"Why do you keep doing whataboutism?  *What about gold, what about USD.*. Just respond directly to my arguments, okay?  You're trying to obfuscate and muddy the argument by making it about anything else.  To take the focus off your pyramid scheme."
IdiotsInCars,ffu330z,t1_ffu239q,1580233441.0,Hehe whoops.  That's my bad.  Mea culpa.
Buttcoin,ffu30fj,t1_ffu1evl,1580233398.0,"Whether or not the price goes up has nothing to do with anything except finding a absolutely massive group of greater fools to buy out the huge layer of current greatest fools.  All the people from 2017-current.  

There's now a massively thick layer on the bottom of the pyramid and it will taken an order of magnitude of people to buy all the existing fools out.  Otherwise the price ain't going anywhere."
Buttcoin,fftlpqa,t1_fftgv6k,1580223766.0,I don't downvote and what about what I said?  There was that.
pittsburgh,fftlnqi,t1_fft8s2o,1580223728.0,Lmfao trying to defend it.  You guys are worked up about this?  My god.  The rabid social media mob.  Constantly on the lookout for people to lynch.  Just scouring the internet for shit to get mad about or offended.  The internet fuckin sucks.
IdiotsInCars,fftd4r5,t1_ffsrxty,1580216984.0,Lmao this is in the UK.  Sorry for your narrative.  Is this what you do?  Just run around a bitch about the US and trying to turn any story you see into an angle for your made up bullshit?
Buttcoin,fftctyr,t1_fft87he,1580216708.0,"You can't even explain why Bitcoin is the special spreadsheet and not some other one.

Spreadsheet cells are greater fool schemes.  All of them"
Buttcoin,fftbj4t,t1_ffszs6a,1580215477.0,"Bahaha you think u/squiz1000 will answer this?  They get sweaty when you ask where they are going to get enough greater fools to buy out everyone from 2016-2019.

There's a THICK motherfucking base on the bottom of this pyramid now.  It's going to take Hercules, Atlas and Jupiter to pick this pyramid up another notch."
Buttcoin,fftb5vv,t1_ffsnwk8,1580215112.0,"There's nothing anyone could be 'wrong' about.  We don't have opinion.  Everything we talk about here is fact.  The only thing that would be possible would be that there's a tsunami of greater fools left who are going to swell the prices one more time and buy out our current crop of greater fools.

I dont see anyone guaranteeing they know how many greater fools are left.  So what you just said is garbage.  But hey - that's why you and u/squiz1000 are butters."
Buttcoin,fftb0rt,t1_ffsgcih,1580214971.0,"Oh God you even do stuff like 'my friend!' at the end of your posts.  You really are just a butter and this post is pretty much about getting attention and maybe a little bit of cope, I dunno.

Stay well, my friend!"
