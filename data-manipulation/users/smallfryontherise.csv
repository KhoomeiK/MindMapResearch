YouShouldKnow,ffvkzu0,t1_ffuvk54,1580266588.0,fat reserves are only used up by caloric deficit. hitting  arms wont use up arm fat stores any faster than anywhere else.
YouShouldKnow,ffvkugq,t1_ffuvpev,1580266489.0,its been observed that the most recently added fat is first fat to be used for energy - generally. im actually having a hard time finding the study on this though so take it with a grain of salt.

EverythingScience,ffstfe7,t1_ffssypd,1580191804.0,could you point me in the direction of this plan? ive checked and found nothing other than him claiming it's safer than uranium and making other claims that get disproven by fact checkers
EverythingScience,ffss8q8,t1_ffss0pb,1580190586.0,i really disagree. im pretty firmly of the belief that we are potentially 20-30 years away from a global economic/societal collapse and these nuclear reactors are just going to be spewing nuclear fires for hundreds and hundreds of years in that case. we have to find a way forward without nuclear imo. unless we find adequate CO2 sequestration methods

MMA,ffhv8ug,t1_ffgiydi,1579955495.0,youre actually correct. he wraps around DC's hips which takes a ton of weight off for him. when you hike you get a backpack that puts the brunt of the weight on the hips for this reason

bloodborne,febfg0y,t1_febd04k,1578958233.0,"oh i started with the cleaver it hits so fucking fast. ya i will say there is a lot i dislike about this game. one of the biggest things is that you have to level up vitality a lot otherwise you can just get one shot by so many things. armor options are very limited in their usefulness imo

of course its still a from soft game i still love it"
bloodborne,febby9v,t3_eobavm,1578957299.0,i just got this game friday and beat it last night. imo it is the easiest from soft game (although i beat the game before getting the dlc because i didn't realize ng+ started automatically). just abuse this rally system. like it's crazy you can heal all your health back after getting hit. and staying unlocked and using roll is very good. don't bother with counter hits/parry/guns/whatever you wanna call it either. that shit is pretty unnecessary and makes the game harder than it needs to be. just roll/dodge and attack. cleric beast is top 3 easiest bosses tho so idk
