Thank you for your advice."
TrollXChromosomes,fgulghw,t1_fgul3i4,1581123763.0,"Thank you. He got sick last week and just couldn’t recover... he had been physically declining etc..so it wasn’t a shock. 

I am choosing to think my acceptance right now is more on the fact that I am thinking of happy memories with him..and that the grief will hit me later.."
TrollXChromosomes,fguk3h0,t3_f0jwsk,1581122780.0,"He was old, physically couldn’t get around as easy as he would have liked. I saw him last a month ago, still the same grumpy old man I loved.  He was put on hospice mid-week, I was planning on seeing him one last time this Saturday..but now...

It’s just hard because no one really tells you how to grieve. I have lost an uncle before to cancer but..this is different. I am not utterly sad or anything like that I just feel..numb. 


Not to mention I have never been to a funeral before...I don’t when it is. Etiquette? Dealing with grieving family members..

How horrible is it I am thinking about work as well. What do I tell my boss..now? When I find out the funeral is? What the hell is wrong with me.."

bestof,fgo2f2b,t1_fgo2beq,1580958195.0,"Oh yes for sure. She is using a butterfly, so chances are she is dosing them with something so it’s probably going to take a bit longer than just taking a bit of blood."
bestof,fgnz3or,t1_fgnvs9x,1580956084.0,"The third and second question would most likely make the dog move too much or get excited. She is placing an IV needle, you want the dog sitting still or else you won’t be able to hit the vein properly.

As for muzzling, the dog may have not shown aggressive behavior that warrants the action etc and could cause more stress to the animal.  

She is keeping calm and trying to get the IV in as quickly and efficiently as possible.

But normally IVs are assisted by someone restraining and or rolling the vein for the person performing the IV."

The man hustled and it paid off for sure."
