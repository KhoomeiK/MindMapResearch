depression,fdqotrw,t1_fdp6oje,1578671657.0,Noted. This is why I’d like one around the same age but I understand where you’re coming from
depression,fdohl1y,t1_fdoef1d,1578605298.0,Why is that?
Advice,fdjba6a,t1_fdhg8v4,1578464045.0,"True, I’m not technically an employee. That is a possibility, the one of leaving to a competitor, but I know that I don’t want to entirely quit this company either. Besides, nothing says that I can’t do both. Appreciate the reply, I’ll dedicate my time in accordance to where I’m seeing the most returns."
OCD,fcovglr,t3_ei5w86,1577842672.0,"I can relate except everyone thinks I’m nice but my family. They’re the only ones convinced I’m a total douchebag. I can pretend to be nice to the point that everyone thinks I’m nice, and I opened up to my family about this and how it’s all fake. So now I’m labeled as a douchebag for being honest with them and telling them that I don’t care about anyone. It’s a mad world guys"
love,fcnf0o4,t1_fcn9r3l,1577810376.0,"Thought my coworker inviting herself to a movie at my place was a sure sign until she cancelled 10 minutes prior. Never assume you have her until you actually do.

Best of luck"
love,fcmwqui,t3_ei06r1,1577795728.0,"Do it my man. I [24M] was in a similar situation with a coworker [23F] just one month ago and waiting turned out to be a terrible mistake. I suspected that maybe she felt the same way at first but I never acted on it. Now all I get is her friendship and spaced out text messages. She and I understand each other so we are great friends but just the thought that we could have been more hurts to think about.

I am 100% convinced that I had a shot in the beginning but I threw away my shot.

Do not throw away yours."
snapchat,fcmmmr6,t3_ehwg1u,1577781783.0,Messaged you
depression,fcleyvm,t1_fcjdrrh,1577746242.0,Haha no idea how you strung that together but I appreciate the concern mate
depression,fcleqw2,t1_fcjcd6b,1577746097.0,"To keep suffering, yes. For no reason, no. Read my reply to the first comment on this thread"
depression,fclejx8,t1_fcisx0g,1577745971.0,"I’m 24 and have a solid career plan for my future. That’s literally the only thing keeping me sane, that no matter who doesn’t like me and no matter how lonely / apathetic I am, I will be successful. And I am driven to do so with every ounce of blood running in me, with all of my soul, because goddamn it something has to make this all worth it. I know people will say that money isn’t the answer, because it’s not, but it will allow most other parts of my life to improve drastically. 

Hence, it all starts with a successful career, and very few things get me as passionate as working in my career. Even my ex didn’t get me this passionate since she didn’t fully understand me and where I am headed.

In other words, keep the faith that things will improve and take charge of that improvement."
depression,fciez7h,t3_eh9up7,1577661535.0,"I nearly witnessed a man jump in front of a bus two nights ago in Dublin. Sad sobbing heap of a man with an amazing friend that psychically stopped him from jumping. One of the scariest things that I ever saw but it made me realize just how common suicidal thoughts are. Don’t do it man, from one depressed human to another—do not do it. I‘m also tired of it, lonely for years now, apathetic, feeling empty, and even my family doesn’t like me at this point. And I’m still here. Keep the faith that things will improve."
lonely,fc3mv80,t1_fc1hy75,1577393496.0,"I know how you feel, except that I can still meet new people effortlessly. Little do they know that it’s all fake but I can pretend and have great introductory conversations with anyone. 

This is what gets me the most, that a lot of people think I’m so “well put together” and so “extroverted” when in reality I’m just 1,000 meters past the point of giving a shit.

I’m rediscovering myself as well, but this time venturing into the unexplored dark sides of myself and realizing just how fucked up I am. Apathetic, careless, impulsive, depressed, etc. There’s some good in me too but exploring this side has led to a lot more of a revelation than I thought."
lonely,fc3mann,t1_fbxfbiv,1577393090.0,"Agreed, I’ve noticed that I feel less depressed when I am working out more consistently and feel more motivated as well.

I don’t blame you, I have hardly any female friends for this exact reason. It’s just easier to avoid them and not get your hopes up unnecessarily, along with getting their hopes up if they liked you initially.

Might as well use that time to focus on the mission and big picture than random girls."
lonely,fbw88qg,t1_fbv7vxz,1577143174.0,"So true, the deepest conversations I've ever had have been with someone who shared her dark places with me and vice versa.

Knowing someone's damaged soul is always better than knowing their pretty face."
