I seriously have nothing against this policy, but as a nurse, whether we work 8-hour or 12-hour shifts, someone has to be there to care for the patient. If Finland is going to mandate or suggest 6-hour shifts, then there will be 4 nurses required per day instead of 2 or 3. It means they need to train a lot more nurses, CNAs, lab techs, respiratory therapists, physicians, radiologists, housekeepers, and dietary/catering personnel."
