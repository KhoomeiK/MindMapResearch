NeckbeardNests,ffe4e20,t1_ffe33bd,1579836395.0,"No worries. It wasn't about her opinion. I understand that point of view.  Everyone has preferences in who they find attractive and want to be romantically involved with. It's just the way it came off as an insult to OPs husband,  that's when some of us tried to explain that to her and she took it wrong. (maybe we also didn't do the best in making it clear enough with what we meant) I really never meant to get under anyone's skin. 

I mean honestly, living with a messy person would drive me crazy as well because I'm such a neat freak and because being clean and organized keeps me on track with my recovery, but I also don't judge those who do live that way because when I wasn't sober,  I did live that way and I know what it's like to be in that type of headspace and having no order in life. Thankfully I was able to help myself out of it. Not everyone gets to be able to say that. So, I can definitely understand both sides of that equation. 

But either way, I appreciate the no hard feelings. Miscommunication is common when talking to people through the internet, so no hard feelings here,  either!"

LMFAO that would be really fucking cool to be able to aim when I pee.  I would never have to sit on the toilet again!"
NeckbeardNests,ffdykc3,t1_ffdy41e,1579832136.0,"I'm not invalidating their opinion. An opinion can't be wrong. It's the way they expressed it,  it came off as an insult to OPs husband. 

I'm actually pretty OCD about my own cleanliness.
Your insults don't hurt me. They just make you look like a jerk.

NeckbeardNests,ffdo33t,t1_ffdnk07,1579824995.0,"Because your comment wasn't just you talking about your personal preferences. It was insulting someone else's. 

Maybe now you know how that feels."
trashy,ffdnnwc,t1_ffdgoyv,1579824739.0,"Don't ever be afraid or uncomfortable talking about it. With anyone. It's a part of who you are now and you should acknowledge and embrace it. The more you talk about it, the less power it will have over you in the long run. 

I talk about it with EVERYONE. New people I talk to,  my doctors (even the ones who didn't already know about my addiction),  my family,  even complete strangers as small talk. I'm proud of how far I've come in my recovery and I want the world to know who I am now and that I am not the mistakes that I have made. It helps spread insight that not all addicts are bad people and that we CAN be saved and DESERVE love, help and respect from the community. That not all of us are completely helpless.  Maybe it will make some of the ignorant people out there, a little less ignorant and a little more knowledgeable. Maybe it will make people want to support charities for rehabs, etc. Maybe our stories will help other people like us in what they are going through. 

You don't have to if you don't want to, but I highly recommend being very open about it and talking about it with the people in your life. It will feel great to get off your chest and it's put you at peace with yourself and it will make staying sober much easier.  

All of us have a story worth being told. We beat the odds! We struggled through the horrors of addiction and we came out the other side! That's worth talking about! You are worth talking about. 

My optometrist told me he's talked about my story to other people,  so has my dermatologist because she has a brother who's an alcoholic who is trying to get sober and she shared my story with him. The story of OUR lives have the ability to touch and inspire so many other lives out there. 

Either way, 

Do what you feel is right for you.  <3"

Very big accomplishments for both of us!  We strong AF! Hell yes"
trashy,ffbd6wn,t1_ffbc9bu,1579760379.0,"It won't. As long I stay clean and sober. 

I was temporarily put on antipsychotics when I was first trying to get clean and that helped a bunch to bring me out of it,  happy to say I don't need them anymore and I'm pretty much back to normal. 
The only thing I currently struggle the most with is social anxiety.  It's hard for me to be in social situations outside of family right now but I'm working on it and it will get easier with time.

But yeah,  I was in a deep psychosis going through all of that and more, for about 2 years. 
I wouldn't wish that on anyone. 
It's part of what's motivating me to never use drugs again."

Congratulations!! You can do it. I believe in you! Try to stay positive. What you're doing is a great thing. The hard work pays off. Even when it doesn't feel like it is. It's worth getting your family and friends back. It's worth the feeling of accomplishment every time you hit those mile markers! And don't forget to reward yourself with a little bit of cake or something. You deserve the treat. 30 days is huge and I'm proud of you! Now you can make it to 60!"
trashy,ffb5n99,t1_ffb2v5x,1579752440.0,"Weed gummies are VERY powerful. I'm not surprised that happened to you.  Sorry you had to experience that. Any form of psychosis from any use of anything at all is a frightening and confusing experience. You arent tethered to reality at all and you can't distinguish what's real from what isn't. Those type of hallucinations aren't fun. For example, what happened to me was:  thinking people are following me, thinking everyone around me was the FBI. Hearing voices in a house that I'm alone in. Hearing people breaking into my house in the middle of the night and me walking down the street wielding a goddamn machete looking for literally no one & also hearing footsteps on my roof every night.

That's just a few things I went through during my psychosis. Lol 

I know what it feels like and I would never, ever invalidate someone else's experiences."
trashy,ffb2og9,t1_ffb20lr,1579750266.0,"Taking a moment away from cooking to respond- Recovery is very hard. There's nothing easy about it. Not for him and not for  family. There will be light. It will just take time. I don't know how much time because everyone's experience is different. It could be a couple months or it could be a couple years. Just hang on with him.  He's trying his best. For four months, all I did was sleep, I woke up to eat and use the bathroom then I would go straight back to sleep. My temperament was terrible, I couldn't control my emotions. It's very difficult and at times it feels so lonely,  even if there are people around who support you. There will be light,  don't give up on that. He will persevere, just remind him that he's loved and that he's strong enough to keep pushing forward. Give him his space but be there for him when he needs you. Recovery isn't an overnight thing. Recovery is a lifelong process. He will be okay  and he will find happiness again.  So will you and your family. Stay strong."
