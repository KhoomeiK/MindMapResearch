college,ffztse2,t1_ffzca4y,1580392668.0,I did ask and I am currently still waiting on a reply. Thank you for the suggestion.
college,ffztph2,t1_ffza0pu,1580392604.0,"If I walk away now, I am done. I make $900 a month. I will never be able to save up to that amount, plus what ever I might owe after 11 more classes. It would have to be a complete career change."
college,ffz2lfq,t1_ffyzhst,1580361918.0,"They were the ones that contacted me. They have not mentioned anything about a payment plan, but they also waited until I had maxed out on everything before contacting me. The other school I attended wouldn’t even let me start a class until it was fully paid for, these guys just kept letting me go until I maxed it all out and then let me know that my student loans had not covered anything."
GetMotivated,ff44ab9,t3_ere89c,1579555216.0,"I started college at 17, I am now 33 and by the end of this year will be receiving my BA. That piece of paper  represent my 16 year journey through having to lose the possibility of an athletic scholarship because my knees decided I was done, working 5 part time jobs at once, multiple mental breakdowns and anxiety attacks,  my nephews unexpected death, the birth of four nieces, stopping school to take care of my grandmother when she broke her hip and my dad and his multiple hospital stays (who may be going back in today to see if he needs to have toes or his foot amputated), four different colleges all saying they cater to students that work (they don’t), the death of two of my uncles, my aunts death, and so much exhaustion that I cannot even begin to tell. I won’t be starting my career job until 35, but I will get there."

cuddlebuddies,ff39t6n,t3_erc193,1579537043.0,"I would LOVE to cuddle up and go fishing with you, unfortunately, I live in California. 
Saw you post on your one eye, that a hell of a catch!"
asexualdating,ff1w6i3,t1_ff1uwfc,1579487554.0,"I have a few students that have that issue, it’s not an issue until one of them doesn’t want to look at the math problem either. Then we have to find a new solution.
I am horrible at buying gifts for people. My friends like to make fun of me for it. Oh well."
asexualdating,ff1thr3,t1_fet4f7w,1579485820.0,"I prefer to either talk through text or by face to face because my being able to pick up on audio social cues sucks. 
I only really play puzzle games, and even those I will play for about a month and then find a new one."
asexualdating,fesyu30,t1_fessajy,1579370269.0,"I was always okay with the early parts of dating, I have always loved getting to know people. It’s after that stage when expectations of physicality started to happen that I had issues with.
I have always been so bad at gaming that I don’t even try to play anything anymore. That being said, the music attached to some games is epic."
asexualdating,ferkl8s,t1_ferjk96,1579355101.0,"I pretty much had the same experience with regards to my asexuality. I was never someone who was interested in dating in jr high and high school, I did have a couple of boyfriends but the relationships never went too far. Even going through college, I just wasn’t interested in sex but still didn’t have a word for it until about five years ago. Then it was like a lightbulb went off."
asexualdating,feoz300,t1_feoxcm5,1579308512.0,"Hello there.
It’s a little difficult to speak about a different experience because I knew a lot of students in RSP (sped students in gen ed classes) when I was in school and we also had a class of functional skills students at our school that everyone interacted with. I will say that I see a lot more administrative willingness for inclusiveness. It has created an environment that is awesome to see in teenagers. There are still a lot of students who are unsure how to act with some of our students, but not mean. Is there anything more specific that you want me to address?
I would love to discuss all of your other topics as well. It’s fun to speak to others about things they are passionate about."
asexualdating,feos9mq,t1_feoqmiy,1579304721.0,Thanks!
ApplyingToCollege,femwpaj,t3_emuo8a,1579271587.0,"This was me in high school. 4.2 GPA, 28 ACT, and 940 on the SAT. I tanked it. I also only took it once, never took the PSAT, and never had any SAT specific study materials. 
It also didn’t help that I was involved in leadership, cheer, and band, then scheduled to take the test the day after homecoming. 
Shit happens."
cuddlebuddies,fem4kdj,t3_eptzde,1579239540.0,Let me know if you ever make your way into the Central Valley. You sound like someone I would love to cuddle with :)
college,fdqeq2s,t1_fdqdszx,1578664746.0,"Agreed. I found Calc II to just be undoing everything I learned in Calc I, but Calc III introduced a third axis and conceptually that broke my brain and failed it."
