IncelsWithoutHate,fgfkkn1,t3_exxv4m,1580741252.0,">It is not just being incels. I could accept it. It is having to struggle just to keep a very mediocre and pathethic life. Seeing ALL others doing better than you. It is overwhelming. The more people I met (like on Tinder) the more I realize how cast away and hopeless I am.

comparing yourself like you do entertains overinflated expectations

>Before I saw again the video of Elliot Rodger and felt like I understood him completely and could feel his pain in my pain, under the look of the spoiled self entitled kid. I know the pain of understanding you have no real chance (not only with girls but inside society in general) 

Elliot was a rich kid from a rich hollywood movie director. He had a ton of chances. He just was chronically depressed. That was his downfall. What made him notable is that he turned his depression into cultivating rage, hate and drive to kill other people. But he's just a depressed person among hundreds of millions of other ones (depression is a rich countries' disease). Most depressed people just hurt themselves, they dont turn on other people.

>When you are lonely at a level that you feel totally detached and rejected from society you start to see the others in a different way. It is you, alone, vs the world. 

Now you're touching the core issue. What makes you or Elliot so radically lonely and - I assume - depressed? Can it be healed and how? What can you do about it? What, among the things you do and decide to feel or think, helps you getting better or makes you worse? Short, medium and long term? What are the motives behind such an attempt at getting better, where do these motives actually come from, and who? How do these motives influence the outcomes referred to above? Advice is cheap and can be free. Actual help or self-help is harder. It's the difference between a personal gear that grips onto another bigger, more collective or nature-related gear, and a gear that fails to grip any and just wastes itself turning.

I'll give one piece of advice before leaving though: feelings are fine. They arise from reality and arguing with them is pointless. But thoughts are another matter. We direct our own thoughts, and we better not make up negative false thoughts that we convince ourselves are true. Because that is on us. We are not forced to think these thoughts. In the thinking realm we are masters of our own domain (or we can and should be) and we do have agency. A negative feeling can feed a negative thought, but it takes self complacency to believe in a negative yet false thought just because our negative feelings are feeding such a thought. Careful there. It's not because you are feeling something negative that the thoughts that arise to justify and set up this feeling as something necessary, are true or good for you in any way."

for what purpose? At the behest of whom? The claim that men do that to make themselves look interesting or feel good is largely deluded. They do this to get a chance of reproducing. Because the females select the males for reproduction, and they select a lot of violent ones, then give those a better reproductive success. Then they push them to be violent and they crush them if they're not. 

**Male violence is a tool of female agency.**

Are you seeing fathers going to court to secure their ""right"" to genitally mutilate and neuter their own daughters against their daughters' moms opinion? (As if an opinion whether to do such a thing should be relevant at all BTW)

Are you seeing guys accusing women of crimes that may have been committed years prior, without any evidence available, then lobbying to get the very notion of presumption of innocence and the requirement for evidence removed from our judicial system?

Are you seeing men open their mouths to get female society to do the work and shoulder the blame for ruining the lives of females they had interactions with at one point in the past by accusing them of crimes just because these men feel like it for the dumbest reasons you can imagine, then getting rewarded for doing so by society as a whole and supported into doing it by most institutions of power?

Are you seeing men complaining they sometimes lose half the custody of their children after having grossly wallowed in removing all custody rights from mothers for 3 generations, by abusing false accusations in family court? Do you see a judicial culture in which such a behavior of falsely accusing mothers of child abuse is openly encouraged to ""speed things up""?

Do you see alarming female suicide stats, especially among women who suffered such crushing divorces and removal from their children? Do you see almost nobody mentioning such alarming women suicide rates or any abuse of women for that matter as if such a notion was offensive, ridiculous and comical, while the ""men as victims"" narrative is touted everywhere by everyone, every corp, every academy, every government? 

Are little girls taught in school that girls are abusers and rapists? Are they faced with 90% of male teachers and caretakers teaching them such anti-female trite from wake up to bedtime as soon as they're in age to go to school?

Are you living in a culture that blissfully ignores all this abuse that it keeps pushing by the other hand because who the fuck cares about women and girls suffering anyway?
