NoStupidQuestions,fek08bz,t1_fejtw3r,1579189815.0,"Do criminals announce their crimes before they commit them? No? So being prepared for as many scenarios as I can improves my survivability, my families & others around me. No one is responsible for your own safety besides you. Take that to heart. Your average police time is 10 minutes. Try holding your breath for that long and tell me how that works out. The bad guy with a gun can create a lot of destruction in that time unless there’s a good guy with a gun willing to stop him. Mass shooters worst fear is someone shooting back at them. That’s why they pick gun free zones where they know they will have the maximum amount of time to do what they want which is kill as many people as they can. I pray to God that I’m never in one of those scenarios but being prepared and trained could be the difference between life and death. So if you want to wait for someone to come save you that’s fine. But not me."
