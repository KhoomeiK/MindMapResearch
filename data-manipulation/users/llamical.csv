He can't do anything for himself, including assess what is realistic for him to shoot for. I mean, if you've been sheltered from the world your entire life first by your parents and then by your girlfriend, you think that being a video game streamer or a microbrewer is possible without any experience.

As someone with an ASD myself, I know that when we fall in love with someone, we fall in love hard and fast. Here's this seemingly amazing person who loves US! The weird person, the person that everyone can sense is not quite right, so ""normals"" keep their distance. But because of the nature of our disorder, we can be very trusting. Too trusting some times. 

I'm sure the your parents and the other people in your life that truly love you have told you this already, but she was most likely a trying to manipulate your trusting nature to get something from you. Maybe you live in a first-world country and she lives in the third world, and she was trying to get a plane ticket/eventually a green card out of you. Maybe she just liked having someone who adored her and made her feel special because she was too afraid to leave Javier, and he made her feel like crap. Whatever it was, she did not have your best interest at heart, and she probably never actually wanted to be with you.

The flipside of this coin though is that when we do find a good person, we are some of the most loyal and caring partners anyone can have, neurotypical or otherwise.

relationship_advice,fefnugy,t3_eowqsj,1579060428.0,"I think what may be happening here is they want to be your boy friend. As in your male platonic friend. You may be interpreting their friendliness incorrectly, and when they realize that you want to get serious, they distance themselves because they were obviously interested in someone else. 

What helped me a lot was online dating. Nobody's motivations there can be misinterpreted, and the self-esteem boost you get from knowing that you're not undateable is really nice."

The long answer: not every guy is a money pit. You can't expect him to drop 50 bucks on flowers (because that is what a ""cheap"" arrangement costs) on you constantly ""just because"" at three months together. Especially since he most likely pays for all your dates together too."
relationship_advice,feffg85,t3_eovnkb,1579055201.0,"She doesn't love you. She's infatuated with you. She's riding high because for the first time in her life her crush has seemingly reciprocated her feelings. But let me warn you: as soon as she realizes that you can't possibly live up to her idealized dream of you, or that you're not equally as infatuated, it'll get messy. Like someone else said, it's time to rip the bandaid off.

relationship_advice,feevk4a,t3_eostqz,1579042140.0,"Some guys are just terrible at giving compliments, because most straight guys rarely if ever receive them. He probably jokes about it not to put you down, but because he's uncomfortable complimenting people. Unless you see him actively complimenting his female peers more than you, I wouldn't say you have anything to worry about."
relationship_advice,fee37dx,t3_eooscq,1579025455.0,"I think two years is enough time to get over a person... it's one thing if she never blocked him and he keeps contacting her without her initiating. (This happens to me with my toxic ex all the time for instance) But she has made the CONSCIOUS decision to unblock him multiple times so she can talk to him. She should be honest with you. If she wants to still be just friends with him, that's fine. But if she keeps lying and hiding, that's suspicious, and probably means that she doesn't just want to be friends with him."
whatsthisbug,fecjvhg,t3_eofzlf,1578975686.0,"Well, it's kinda hard to tell with just that picture. But if they seem to die on their own without you trying to kill them, they're probably mili/centipedes. If they don't die that easily, they're probably some sort of beetle larvae.

relationship_advice,fecg5rm,t3_eofg94,1578973118.0,"Heres the multitude of unsexy reasons why she might think she has an STI that have nothing to actually do with you: Maybe she has a latex allergy? Maybe she got a yeast infection? (those are pretty common if she didn't clean herself properly afterwards or douched with something that didn't agree with her, or douched in general if she's sensitive to chemicals), maybe she wasn't expecting to bleed or for it to be uncomfortable because it was her first time? Maybe she panicked and took plan b just in case? (That stuff can REALLY screw up your chemistry).

relationship_advice,fea6vdi,t3_eo921j,1578945039.0,You may be overreacting just a little bit. I doubt anyone would be careless enough to openly admit their love for a man in a relationship where that man's SO can see.
relationship_advice,fea12cj,t3_eo8jet,1578943259.0,"If it was, it's a pretty underhanded way of hinting at that she wanted to get back together. I think it's pretty clear that when an ex tells you that they can't be ""just friends"" when the breakup was amicable, they still have romantic feelings for you. 

If she's the sort that thinks you would be willing to blueball yourself potentially forever for the off chance she might de-friendzone you, she's a pretty selfish person."
relationship_advice,fe9k3rr,t3_eo7mfk,1578938560.0,"I think she's just angry because she's coping poorly with ""losing"" you. I think the best thing you can do is take a step back and give her space. She owes you an apology, and she'll probably give it when she calms down.

However, you mentioned that your friend has social anxiety, which she seems to be self-medicating with weed and religion. Those two things are often at odds with one another, so she's lashing out at you for effectively doing nothing wrong. 

This is probably the cycle: she smokes because she probably feels like she can't go out in social situations without smoking, and it helps treat her anxiety 
She goes to church and they feed her some BS about how weed is evil
She blames you for ""enabling"" her

She's a blamer, so until she can acknowledge that it's her that's the problem, you're going to be supporting her expensive habit with little thanks in return."
relationship_advice,fe9bggt,t3_eo6o7z,1578936057.0,I think a key point here is that she keeps insisting that she doesn't want to see you with another girl. Translation: she doesn't want YOU to move on until she's good and sure that T is the better option.
