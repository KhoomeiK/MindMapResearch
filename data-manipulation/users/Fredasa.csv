This is the best way to approach this problem.  Leaving it on means you're hearing it 100% of the time, and that kills opportunities for soaking in the game's atmosphere.

As for credit?  I frankly understand where they're coming from.  Ask anyone to name the top three companies who are doing the best job of bringing the future to us right now, and chances are pretty good SpaceX and Tesla will both land spots on that list, justifiably so.  The guy started and then single-handedly rescued both companies from the kind of oblivion that would have made them just a fascinating footnote in history.  And he doesn't just run them; he's one of the main engineers, self-taught.  Anyone who owns Tesla stock (and isn't pulling short-sighted shenanigans with it) is riding high and there's basically zero chance that's going to change.  The only thing I can even begin to compare this to is how the iPhone changed everything, forcing everyone to rip them off to survive, and really that was far more inevitable than what's being ushered in by SpaceX/Tesla and their latecomer copycats.  My next car will be a car of the future.  I might have died before getting that opportunity, but it's going to happen, because somebody took the risk.

I feel a little bad for that subreddit because even though there are certainly things to take issue with, with a car company, a space company, or one fallible man, 90% of the people there are harboring irrational hatred, like flat-earthers or climate deniers who think they're fighting the good fight against uppity know-it-all scientists.

Let's face it.  They obviously couldn't keep it the same as it'd been in two-thousand-and-freaking-eight.  What we got was inevitable.

There's a nasty bug in FO4 that makes it to where, under many various conditions, traveling around the world while in third-person is literally slower than keeping it in first-person.
