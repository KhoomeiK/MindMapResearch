AskReddit,ffheqqw,t1_ffh8yip,1579932206.0,"""closing time"" us when the establishment is supposed to be *closed*, not *starting* to close. When you show up to a place like a restaurant 20-30 minutes before they close, KNOWING they are about to close, you are preventing them from doing their normal closing routines in a timely manner, raising their frustration, and just being an overall selfish jerk. Yeah it's their job, but if you're hungry, go to a place that's open later or come in earlier. No need to make someone's job harder just cuz you ""really like this particular restaurant"". If they changed the hours, jerks would very likely still come in way too late."

All it took after 4 years of being mistreated and lied to was my supervisor telling me to my face that I was her least favorite employee for me to finally go ""wtf? I've given this company 4 years of my life and this is how you treat me? I'm worth more than this"" and I found a different job. I'm not even giving this place two weeks notice after how they've treated me lately. They don't deserve that from me. Know your worth, people!!"

The next day they had a safety meeting with every supervisor in the company and every employee in every account associated with the company had to sign a safety sheet about being careful when it's icy outside. They reeeeeally didn't want someone getting L&I involved because they broke their back slipping on ice while on the job."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fecfu3m,t3_eodqgu,1578972900.0,"I worked at a gas station that didn't have pay-at-pump gas pumps so people could just pump gas without paying then we had to trust them to come inside and pay (this was due to our cheap ass boss that lived 6 states away being too tight fisted to buy card reading pumps) so of course we frequently had people who would pump and dash, and if course he was also too tight fisted to update his 25yr old security cameras so we could never read license plates or identify faces, but they were just good enough to tell who was on shift in the gas station at the time. His policy was ""whoever is on shift when a gas theft happens loses the cost of that theft out of their paycheck, regardless of the circumstances."" I myself lost $30 to this policy, but I worked with people who lost more than $400. Of course, this was illegal for him to do, but it was a small town with not a lot of job options and he knew that, so if we didn't pay, he'd ""find"" a reason to fire us. Talk about a piece of utter shit."

I'm with you on your previous comment. They were also heavily inspired by Princess Mononoke with world design, so that on top of all the other inspirations makes me very hopeful that the second one is only going to add to the beauty and wonder of the first. I am beyond excited"

I'd hope it wasn't the case, but she may be feeling guilty about how long it's been since she's seen them and feels like the trip is a necessity. I know that feeling. I try to make it over to visit my family once a year, but last year we weren't able to make the trip due to job issues, and now my family is hardcore guilting us into visiting soon this year...and our job issues still haven't been solved. There isn't much we can do about it and I'd love to see them, but it's just not in the budget. 

That is a very long way for her to drive, especially if she's going alone. The wear and tear on her car alone could be costly, not to mention the $140+ a day in gas it will cost her. I hope she's fully thought out her costs, and I'd hope her family would understand if she decided to put it off until she could save enough to make it."
