MealPrepSunday,ffzttps,t3_ew0f3q,1580392697.0,"I'm always amazed at how many different names thes have, Pasties, empanadas, etc. Every culture has a food like this and they all call them different things."
AnimalsBeingDerps,ffz53z0,t3_evsihz,1580364292.0,"Fun Fact: Cats don't have collar bones, so generally speaking if their head will fit, so will the rest of them. Unless they're too pudgy and break the cat door off."

ImGoingToHellForThis,ffuo1wl,t1_ffuffw9,1580245998.0,"I agree completely. I think this is a shitty thing to do the day the guy dies, and I have my doubts to the veracity of his claims, but it is not and should not be illegal to be an asshole. 

When did a simple stupid comment become grounds to grind someone to a pulp?"
AnimalsBeingDerps,ffulsj7,t3_ev83rh,1580244660.0,"It's sad, But I'm laughing because the derp is like ""Hey, were makin' a video, cool. oop hair"" I love how animals are just in the moment."

AskThe_Donald,ffpqj0u,t3_eue093,1580102192.0,"I personally think it's a good idea to have a (One) government run media outlet as long as there aren't restrictions on independent outlets. It's a good way to disseminate important information (Emergency situations, Political debates, important speeches, etc) and potentially a platform for transparency. 

However NPR is not that. It's still less biased than say, CNN or MSNBC, but it's fallen into the same hole the American College system fell into."
