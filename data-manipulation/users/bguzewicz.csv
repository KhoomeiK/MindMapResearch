And in my view, it’s not the petition that’s creepy and weird, but the proposed legislation. I looked up the bill, and in it there’s a lot of vague language about “community standards” and “general pornographic content.” Essentially communities would decide for themselves what is and is not acceptable for minors to rent from libraries, which on the surface doesn’t seem so bad. But the thing is, community members would need to be present at those meetings to be able to vote on it, so realistically, a small handful of people would be able to dictate to the community at large what they can and can’t read. And holding the librarians personally responsible is disgusting. I don’t give a damn about the politics of the librarians, that’s irrelevant. What is relevant is this sets a precedent for censorship in a “free” society."

books,ff0kelw,t1_feyxqzp,1579469703.0,"The subreddit rules allow for discussion on all topics related to books, even tangentially. And in my view, itâ€™s not the petition thatâ€™s creepy and weird, but the proposed legislation. I looked up the bill, and in it thereâ€™s a lot of vague language about â€œcommunity standardsâ€ and â€œgeneral pornographic content.â€ Essentially communities would decide for themselves what is and is not acceptable for minors to rent from libraries, which on the surface doesnâ€™t seem so bad. But the thing is, community members would need to be present at those meetings to be able to vote on it, so realistically, a small handful of people would be able to dictate to the community at large what they can and canâ€™t read. And holding the librarians personally responsible is disgusting. I donâ€™t give a damn about the politics of the librarians, thatâ€™s irrelevant. What is relevant is this sets a precedent for censorship in a â€œfreeâ€ society."

It's disguised as ""protecting the children,"" but if you're a conservative that believes in small government and personal liberty, then why would you be for more unnecessary rules and regulations?
