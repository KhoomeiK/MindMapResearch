politics,ff76b03,t1_ff6mhpb,1579641972.0,You took the words right out of my mouth. I was just going to add “the smug son of a bitch”.

politics,ff3l1sa,t1_ff33uga,1579543316.0,"It’s possible that by picking candidates who have no chance of winning, that’s a way to ensure Trump gets re-elected. I’m Democrat or vote independent and I loathed Hillary, as many people did."
politics,ff3kdq7,t3_erd01f,1579542909.0,"We knew they weren’t going to endorse Bernie. Last time they endorsed Hillary. I used to have a great deal of respect for this paper until I started asking myself-why are there so many ads for properties in the millions that most of us would never be able to even walk through, much less buy? And ads for jewelry that’s incredibly ugly but a “must-have” in the thousands of dollars. Absolute decadence catering to the 1 percent. You only have to see this to realize the publishers want the status quo to keep going, thus the endorsements make sense. They just endorsed someone I also respected until I realized what an absolute LIAR she is (Warren) and a total zero (Klobuchar). So sick of the way the wealthy control everything. This is why Bernie is my only pick. He does not LIE."

PoliticalDiscussion,fefczf1,t3_eom9vr,1579053649.0,Not at all. The main stream media is just dying to find a way to tamp down the enthusiasm for Bernie. We're all supposed to love Joe Biden (not working).

gadgets,feazhpp,t3_eo4f03,1578953869.0,You raise an interesting point about how the opting in part actually works.
gadgets,fear1xf,t1_feajcoz,1578951454.0,"Well, I would love to use one for all the reasons just listed. I don’t kid myself into thinking I’m in an impenetrable bubble by not owning one. I just think it’s frightening that we’re all willingly handing over any last vestiges of what privacy we have left because that’s just the”way it is”. It’s not perfect but in the EU they’ve passed the GDPR to force data collectors to be transparent and put in writing so anyone can read and understand what’s being collected. The biggest difference is that there, the default is an individual has to give permission BEFORE data is collected. Here, we have to read through reams of legalese to figure out how to opt out (which, BTW, I just tried to do with another article on here and after literally pages, had no opt out options even though I clicked on “privacy management of data”)."

If the system has allowed you to benefit, why are you so selfish you aren’t willing to pitch in? Other points on this-I can’t understand mean-spirited people with an attitude of “if I didn’t get it, you shouldn’t get it either” when things are a LOT different now (there were actually places of higher learning that charged no tuition). And lastly, why wouldn’t we want to leave this situation better when we leave?"

news,fcg7jxd,t1_fcfntfn,1577637217.0,And another point to this entire issue of not buying Chinese: Walmart started out as selling “American made” and later became one of the largest U.S. importers of Chinese goods. They would definitely feel it if everyone boycotted buying Chinese goods. Their imports from China into the U.S. have been so huge it contributed to the U.S. trade deficit.
