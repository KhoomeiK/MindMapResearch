tampa,ffpv7iq,t3_euhvqa,1580106970.0,"If you applied to 200-300 places and only got 10 replies then you're applying to jobs you don't have the experience/skills/schooling for or your resume needs a major overhaul. There is a sub here on Reddit that will help with the resume but I don't know the name.


There are tons of jobs here but you're looking in the wrong places or don't want those types of jobs. There are tons of restaurants and bars you could be a server or bartender at and they make killer money. There's a lot of call centers and insurance places that need people. 


Seriously though look at your resume and make some changes. I would also ask around for that sub. Then try recruiting places like Kforce, Insight Global, Skybridge, Robert Half, Thrivas Staffing, Kelly Services, USA Staffing, Crawford Thomas Recruiting, Randstad Staffing, and there's a ton more. I think Amazon is always hiring but heard it's a shit place to work for.


Send out a resume to all those places I listed and I bet you'll find something. I wish you the best and hope you find something soon!! Beat of luck!!"

You can run a rifle or pistol length upper on lower with pistol brace but can't put a pistol length upper on a lower with rifle stock as that's an SBR. There's also the 26in rule I think it is where a vertical grip would be ok if overall length is greater then 26in I believe.
