If your house is a complete disaster, you look like shit, nobody has slept, and you’re eating garbage food because you’re too disorganized to cook, but you hold and cuddle your baby a lot, you are doing parenting right. That’s like 90% of what they need – to be fed, to be warm, and to be cuddled. Read the book “the boy who was raised as a dog” for some great insight into early brain development and its long-term impact on health and wellness. it’s easy to get overwhelmed and feel like a complete failure, especially in those early months, and knowing that you are doing the one thing that is going to give your baby a better chance of developing into a healthy, emotionally well-adjusted child can be what it takes to let yourself relax and just enjoy them. I know I certainly would have had a better time! I held my babies lots because one took forever to breast-feed and the other one just didn’t like being put down, but I always stressed about the other things I wasn’t getting done."

But she was so obsessed with it that she’d give me a look and say “we don’t use the word ‘fat’” if my kids called our fat cat (who is objectively fat) “fat”. I mean I get teaching your kids that they are not to comment on people’s weight or appearance, but “fat” is a legitimate term applicable to far more than just people.  And can we please pretend like not acknowledging weight is the only means of giving a person a healthy self image.

She wasn’t freaking out, and was starting to remember where she was once she saw someone in scrubs.

news,fdh6a2u,t3_el8hqr,1578416290.0,"A British Columbian man was charged with starting a fire that ended up as a massive wildfire - he inadequately stomped out a cigarette close to the woods behind his house.

When we camp with a group in a remote cove on a lake in a forested area of BC, there are forestry officials who go up and down the lake and check campsites for signs of camping fires. They don’t just watch for smoke, they pull their boat up, go to any fire pits set up before the fire ban and feel it to see if it’s warm. If you’re caught with a fire (other than contained and suitably located propane fires like BBQs) during a fire ban, the fines are [PHENOMENAL ](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/wildfire-status/about-bcws/governance/legislation-regulations/summary-of-fines) . Lighting a fire is $1150 and every person (including juveniles) present at the fire can be fined $575 as well. Even failing to immediately report a fire nets you a big fine. 

Fines and criminal charges don’t deal with the root issues of climate change that promote fire activity, and they don’t do anything to help prevent ones started by lightning strikes, but they do help change the culture surrounding fire risks and reduce behaviours that could spark a wildfire."

awfuleverything,fcyjr4a,t1_fcxqcwv,1578081240.0,This is the worst thing I’ve ever read in my life.
nursing,fcygqt9,t1_fcxedbo,1578079823.0,"People see TV where people arrest, get CPR, and wake up in perfect shape and kiss the protagonist. What they don’t realize is that only a very small percentage of WITNESSED arrests will go on to get back to normal. What TV doesn’t show you is that CPR is not always successful, it’s not permanently successful, and the end results even if it is successful are not pretty and may be lasting. 

 [This website that studies CPR rates](https://www.the-hospitalist.org/hospitalist/article/124220/what-are-chances-hospitalized-patient-will-survive-hospital-arrest) in hospital explains it well - people over-estimate their likelihood of being revived by CPR by 60.4%, but “the average survival-to-discharge rate for adults who suffer in-hospital arrest is 17% to 20%”. That means that IF you arrest in a hospital with trained staff and a readily available defibrillator and code team, you a 1 in 5 chance (or less) of ever leaving the hospital. Sure, they might get your heart beating on it’s own, but that is often only temporary. You’ll have broken ribs (which are a bitch to heal even in young healthy people), you may have sustained extensive and permanent brain damage from lack of blood flow to your brain during the arrest. You might die of the incurable thing that led to arrest. 

So it’s not that CPR is always bad, it’s that it’s not the best choice for a lot of people in hospital. If a relatively healthy-ish person arrests due to a treatable cause (like a dude in his 40s with no other illnesses who has a heart arrhythmia and just needs an AICD) and it’s witnessed and they can be coded immediately, they have a better chance of surviving the trauma of CPR. Doing CPR on a 90 year old with heart failure, previous strokes, limited mobility, and cancer is just straight up cruel. She’s going to die soon regardless, and all that CPR is doing is making sure she dies a week or two later in excruciating pain. The cost is not even close to being outweighed by the benefit. A kid who has been face down in a pool for an unknown period of time and is cold and white and pulse less might be that one miraculous case to come back, or they might be pretty much vegetative for the next 4 to 5 decades. 

Our doctors ABSOLUTELY discuss the realities of CPR with patients at the start of admission and with any changes in their health and they are honest about the odds of survival and what CPR looks like, but there are some families who feel like DNR is the same as giving up or suggests that they don’t want their loved ones to live. They will put their loved ones through HELL for a few extra days, and even thought their loved ones body is just DONE and beyond the ability of modern medical science to repair, they cannot come to terms with human mortality. 

I had one person whose spouse was unable to move on his own, required total care, couldn’t really talk and couldn’t keep his airways clear of secretions. He’d been in and out of ICU on a ventilator because he’d get repeated bouts of horrific pneumonia because he couldn’t clear the secretions. He’d never walk again, was on a tube feed permanently because he couldn’t eat without choking to death, couldn’t even move his own arm to scratch his face, had a catheter to drain his urine and had to be changed for every bowel movement. Even with frequent turning and diligent changing and a special mattress he was starting to develop little bedsores. He required suctioning almost every 15 minutes, and I’d get huge globs of mucus out every time - he was basically always feeling like he was choking because of how affected his swallowing and coughing reflexes were. I’d have to get RT to come up and pass a tube down his nose to get the deep ones that I couldn’t get with the oral suction. This guy’s life was NOT GOOD, and it was not a question of IF he was going to die of pneumonia, it was a question of WHEN. The doctors has had multiple conversations with his wife, who staunchly refused to make him a DNR because she loved him and “didn’t mind taking care of him”. She loved him so much that the idea of losing him was worse than the idea of caring for the tortured shell of the man who used to be her husband. She just couldn’t put two and two together and realize that what she was choosing for him wasn’t really loving, and that he might not choose it for himself if he could still talk.

So read up on resuscitation, talk to your loved ones about your wishes, make out your advance medical directives for what you want done in the event of different illnesses and changes in function, and amend them as needed. Do this while you are well, because illness and accident can strike at any time, and you want your loved ones to be able to make decisions for you based on what they KNOW you want and not out of guilt or fear or even misguided love."
