GetMotivated,fcdd3il,t3_egxsa4,1577608916.0,"IDK man, to try to control one's thoughts is not a feasible process. It's like building a wall to stop a river altogether, eventually the wall will break if we try to stop the flow. Instead of focusing on trying to stop the negative thinking, its better to change your actions even if you're thinking negatively. For me, it's like the dark knight quotes “It's not who you are underneath, it's what you do that defines you.” "

I am not saying that she should date a guy with mental issues if she doesn't want to, but labelling someone in a demeaning way while going through the same is, infact a lack of empathy. Not a great trait to look in someone's personality."
