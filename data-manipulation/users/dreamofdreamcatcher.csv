Dreamcatcher's [""There's Nothing Holding Me Back""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F95WZZ0_y0s) as well as Siyeon's [""Eraser""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5ozyxgEcws) are both amazing. 

Not sure if this counts as a cover or not, but Ysabelle's English cover of [Psycho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k4pOWB7uJ0) was really nice to hear and matched the lyrics well."
superstarsmtown,ffjvtpu,t3_eu120y,1580008338.0,"Basically there's a monthly score challenge for each song that ranges from 2.5 mil to 4.0 mil. If you press on the lower left of the screen while in the music lobby (where all the songs are) and then click on 'check monthly challenge reward' then it will show you how many songs you need to get those rewards. Each song can only be counted once and will only be counted if you pass the score threshold listed for the song. 

Prizes include artist tickets (which are rather useless since they only give you a random A/S/R card and a random theme for the selected group) and diamonds."

depression,ffj2ef1,t3_etvtrv,1579988672.0,"Aw man I'm sorry dude. It's always so tough when school forces people together. I hope to give you strength to push through that one college class. Also, if they are pricks then they aren't your friends. College is full of wonderful people, but those ""friends"" definitely don't fit in that category. It's not too late to try and still branch out and find another great friend, although that'll take time and patience. I wish you luck."

Sat,ffedbij,t1_ffed8cy,1579843854.0,Oof yeah you should try to do that perhaps during your spring break? I've gone on a local one and it really has helped me open my eyes to that school and more that they have to offer. It helps you figure out and visualize if you could really fit in with the culture or not.
Sat,ffed6qe,t1_ffed462,1579843729.0,Oh dang lol that sounds real tough. I hope we can both last through the tough season of college apps and find colleges that really stand out to us for their unique features and programs rather than their national rankings.
Sat,ffec71t,t1_ffebynk,1579842798.0,"Ah man yeah college admissions are just overwhelming and too unpredictable. Preparing for 4 years just for one college decisions just kills me. They take the fun out of high school. Good luck with college admissions though (if you're a senior, I'm a junior right now)!"
Sat,ffeb4zh,t1_ffeauz9,1579841839.0,"Hm honestly I'd be so unsure on how an experiment like that would turn out. I know some Asians are definitely more cookie-cutter in terms of being forced to play an instrument or participate in STEM activities, but I also know some Asians do just happen to love STEM and aren't trying to be cookie-cutter. 

Unfortunately I think that the bar just keeps getting raised higher and higher, making the rules near impossible to beat unless you cure cancer at a crazy young age or something lol"
superstarsmtown,ffeah5p,t3_et4r7q,1579841252.0,"Probably not, but just wondering, how long did they have that message of ""Coming soon in another update!""? They probably forgot about this feature lol"
superstarsmtown,ffeafof,t1_ffe9jr6,1579841216.0,"If you view your cardbook and click on a particular artist, there should be a mystery box on the right of each theme. When you click on it it says something like ""prize coming in the next update""."
Sat,ffeacwn,t1_ffe7y2p,1579841150.0,"This is what makes college admissions so tough. There are infinitely many factors to consider, and even if admissions is 'holistic' they still will never know the full story or know truly the classroom environment that we learned in. Some people get luckier with the environment they group in while others aren't as lucky. 

I do think that standardized tests are terrible ways to determine college readiness, but again, how do we create a universal scale to really measure something as subjective as college readiness."
Sat,ffea0wz,t1_ffe7lh8,1579840859.0,"True point, I do recognize the effectiveness for affirmative action. SAT standards (as well as all other academic standards) definitely are higher for Asians. It is quite unfortunate to see that affirmative action is working against Asians by unintentionally raising the standards for us (I'm Asian) as well."
Sat,ffe097u,t3_et1dl7,1579833360.0,"Take a quick break (for a day or two of no studying) if you feel like you're getting too frustrated. I would also recommend going to your local library for prep books. Also, try doing old practice tests and QAS tests (linked in the sidebar). When you get a math question wrong, first do the question over again until you get the right answer. Don't rely on the explanation to help you learn - doing it yourself the right way is the only way to learn. Good luck!"
depression,ffe01sw,t3_et0xtj,1579833211.0,Some people just don't understand emotions well enough. But don't feel bad for venting your feelings - venting feelings is a human thing!
Sat,ffdy63t,t1_ffdxfe8,1579831852.0,"College admissions aren't solely based on SAT scores either. Essays and extracurriculars often have extra weight in admissions that I'm sure schools consider. I believe most colleges would view a 1580-1590 the same as a 1600 because they are both top scores. 

I still believe that the removal of the SAT in general for everyone, regardless of whether they apply to a top school or a local state school, would tighten competition even more for everyone regardless of race. Students don't compete against those of the same race, they compete against those of the same caliber and same stats."
