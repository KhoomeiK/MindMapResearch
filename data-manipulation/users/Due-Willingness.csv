Personally, after a binge I see it 2 days later- then takes like 4-5 days for me to lose the “stupid fake bloat weight” to get back to point A. If you keep doing what you should be, the weight will come off. It’s easier for it to fall off in the beginning and then it slows down. Don’t let it demotivate you."

Not to say you couldn't be, but keep an eye for ice chomping desires. Look out for weird bruising too.

-had my annual checkup for work, saw the highest number on the scale
-insurance contacted me about signing up for a weight loss program they pay for
-did nothing for a few weeks but feel like a fat loser
-bought a scale
-signed up for the weight loss program (ignored it for 2 more weeks)
-started just logging all intake with guesstimates on loseit
-started making healthier food choices (and being honest w myself that I really was eating a lot worse than I imagined)
-added CICO
-got a food scale and do my best to meal prep and weigh it
-got a gym membership
-started weighing daily
-actually went to the gym and walked on treadmill
-got happyscale app to save my sanity as long as the average weight is going down and ignore daily flux
-working out more consistently

This is leading to much slower progression in my weight loss vs when I lost weight in college 10 years ago, which is frustrating, but I know I’m making actual habit changes that I’ll add up 4-6 months from now. I’m only 3-ish months in this go around, and know I don’t have enough data yet to extrapolate conclusions. (I’m an accountant, so when I break it down to numbers it helps me take the emotional component out of weight loss.) Meditating and coming on this board to talk about my experiences helps a lot too. I like the website losertown too, which helps me stay focused on the long term. I feel like I’m in a groove now that I can sustain for the whole year to get where I want to be. If I only lose about 3-4 lbs a month, that’s still huge over the course of time. It’s about the long game, baby! You’ll get there, I believe in you!
