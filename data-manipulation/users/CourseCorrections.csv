bipolar,fcwt1mm,t1_fcwr1b0,1578036440.0,"Ah sorry.  Yeah you're right, Cleaning up after religions is a headache.    I have been visiting churches , mosques  and temples meeting people.   My brother is Gay.  I stand up to them if I don't like what they have to say.   I carry dialogue from one  group to another.   Ideas are toolboxes for humanity.  Mostly I wish good ideas and values to spread.  I will often listen to what they have to say and come up good responses to bring up in the future.      We need to get everyone working as defenders of creation.   If there is something bad rooted in one community often costs everyone.  Take bedbugs for instance.  I will make sure to help my neighbor deal with them regardless what groups they belong to.   Bad ideas and conflicts between groups spreading can be fought to some degree with understanding, reason  and transparency.    Go in peace my friend."

Life has been good.  I have been there for my family through tough times.   I have grown.  I still see things others don't notice.   I have forged the chains holding my mind into wings that carry me.    I'm glad I can keep walking this earth and seeing people find their way.  I see people grow.  I see cities grow.  I see love grow.  Find  love thats love you back.   Know that blessings lift curses so cast blessings.  Selfless blessings are the most magical.   There is hope. There is love.   Great stress and difficulty can be used to forge powerful love.
