offmychest,ffgzp9r,t3_etikhf,1579919229.0,"something similar happened to me, was traveling from FL to CO and stopped in missouri for gas. it was about midnight. some guy came up to me and my bf repeatedly asking us for change, for food, for a dollar, then eventually for a ride somewhere. kept telling him no, we have a car full of stuff and people, no we're on a tight schedule. he kept pushing while following us from the store to our car and finally i just said ""please back off we have somewhere to be, sorry i can't help you but please leave us alone"" glad i wasnt alone"

MealPrepSunday,ff6zscr,t3_erw9bo,1579638255.0,"i cant believe no ones asked yet, but where did those cookies come from? 😍 store bought? homemade?"
trashy,ff3gybn,t1_ff3g9f2,1579540811.0,i used to love twitter. now its just a cesspool of people begging for a smidge of attention. they'll say anything just to get some retweets
trashy,ff3gsge,t1_ff3g5d4,1579540718.0,"im assuming she said it so that other people will quote it with captions like ""crazy bitches think this way"" and they'll get 100k+ retweets which in turn gets the crazy bitches twitter account some attention too. its literally an endless cycle. people will say dumb shit JUST for the attention, whether it be good or bad because all they want is attention. that's twitter bud"
trashy,ff3ew3q,t3_erf8nl,1579539657.0,it was literally a joke and thats not even her husband its her boyfriend. clearly half this sub doesnt use twitter and doesn't get twitter comedy. it may not be funny to you but thats how it is on that site
NoStupidQuestions,feakoje,t3_eo1eer,1578949932.0,pat their head
StonerEngineering,feajqcc,t3_eo6it5,1578949648.0,this is the dumbest post on here. tips cost like 2 dollars. also smoking bleach?? have fun slowly killing yourself
StonerEngineering,feajf5t,t1_fea32s2,1578949580.0,what??
MadeMeSmile,feaervb,t3_eo4nsu,1578947818.0,"maybe you can ask the owners if its okay for you to walk him/play with him a few times a week? tell them you wouldn't expect any pay, you just love dogs"
trashy,feacihi,t3_eo56i7,1578946999.0,and what is this supposed to be written on? looks like a binder.
relationship_advice,fdfnef4,t3_ef2yhl,1578365717.0,have you told your wife yet that you're obsessed with someone? you're a fucking creep ass loser and/or a liar
trashy,fdc3do6,t3_ekjnra,1578266301.0,"ah my favorite music genre, roll and roll"
offmychest,fcwxuxh,t1_fcwx9cn,1578042286.0,"you're really looking to pick a fight with someone over this huh? i saw your comment. wasnt going to say anything until now. honestly, you seem like you dont know what its like to be TRULY bullied. let me guess, some girl called you a slut? said you're fat? you seem to be forgetting that OP was also a CHILD during this as well. in the 8th grade you're 12/13 years old. thats old enough to know not to make EVIL comments like that to an innocent person. OP gave him a taste of his own medicine. shitty things happen to shitty people, i 100% believe in karma and this kid got a big spoonful of it."
offmychest,fcwvzbg,t1_fcwvn2k,1578039932.0,"im not at all! tbh i didnt even think it was gonna be long because i didnt look ahead of time, i was so interested in what this was about that i just kept going until the end"
offmychest,fcwv9wr,t3_ejcacb,1578039066.0,this was an incredible story. wow. let me tell you i was on the edge of my seat as i was reading to see what you said/did. absolutely blown away. kudos to you
ZeroWaste,fcw9ce5,t1_fcvwykb,1578020134.0,did you read the article?
offmychest,fcusg22,t1_fctz4un,1577987595.0,i am aware. ive had cops come to my door asking to look inside. just is it really worth it to have cops being nosy as well as your neighbors?
trashy,fctb839,t3_eisd9z,1577937896.0,so how is this trashy?
offmychest,fctacv8,t3_eirilf,1577937185.0,its funny until cops show up at your door asking to take a look into your backyard
AmItheAsshole,fccpaaf,t1_fccnc8z,1577601038.0,"as long as he made it clear to her he didn't want to go with her anymore, then NTA. based on her response though it seems like she either thought they were still going together, or she's crazy"
AmItheAsshole,fcbs7vc,t3_eh0p75,1577590385.0,"YTA she didn't say she didn't want to go at all. she said she just wanted to go as friends which is perfectly fine for a female to do. so to her understanding she was going to see a movie with a good friend, and then you decided to pick a different girl to go with AFTER you made plans. thats a dick move, of course she got upset.

Edit: Changing to NTA after seeing the edit. thanks for clearing that up OP"
ZeroWaste,fcamufa,t1_fcaly6j,1577572385.0,"it only has become synonymous because of people like YOU. do you see what im getting at? no one is asking you to hide it away, theres nothing wrong with adding a warning before making a public post if you know you have trans friends, it takes 2 seconds. and if you don't, i doubt anyones going to shame you for it. not everyone knows to add a trigger warning when talking about periods."
ZeroWaste,fcalen6,t1_fcagj9t,1577571541.0,"there's a difference between being triggered by something, and being offended by something. maybe get off this site and do some research before spouting nonsense."
offmychest,fbxuhec,t3_ef1yjd,1577200838.0,wow spoilers much
