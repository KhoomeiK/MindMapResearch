depression,ff26r5x,t3_er74kb,1579495401.0,"Hey! I'm sure you've got some great qualities about yourself that other people like in you, now it's just time for you to try to start noticing them in yourself. Even people that say there's nothing good about them almost always have some things to appreciate. For starters, I can appreciate your honesty and self awareness haha ;P

Keep fighting friend, we all gotta work on loving ourselves more eh"
getdisciplined,ff1kpnt,t3_eqynxb,1579480748.0,":) this sorta story sounds soso nice, I think you both are so lucky to have each other! I'm sure you know that though 😉

Best wishes friend!! She's a keeper"
depression,ff1j4tw,t1_ff0n1so,1579480031.0,"Personally I find making other people happy is very fulfilling, however you accomplish that. Don't know if that's the answer for you too but I think it's worth a shot. Plus I feel like when you have felt the worst parts of life, it allows you to help people better because you know how bad feelings can be and don't want the same for others."

depression,fe0e2xp,t3_enivpx,1578811490.0,"Just as you would love for us to continue fighting for a better life, we all would love the same for you. I'm sure there are people in your life that also think that way even if you don't realize it.

Something that helped me a bit was to take life one day at a time - don't focus on having a great life, just focus on today. This one day. Try to make today an okay day. Maybe sometimes even a great one. And when you wake up the next morning, just worry about that day being a great one.

Easier said than done but don't settle for having given up - keep fighting as much as you can, even if it's almost nothing. ""You can't go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending"""
depression,fe0d71o,t3_enifx6,1578810516.0,I would check it out :)
depression,fe0d2ju,t3_eniont,1578810381.0,"You can work towards being a person that people do want to be around, it'll feel impossible but it can work with time.

Even if you don't do that, there would be that 1 in 1000 person that will actually like you for you, I met someone like that this year. First time I've made a friend since school. Gotta put yourself out there, be patient, and hope for the best.

This is all a LOT easier said than done but I thought I should maybe mention it in case it might give you even an inkling of motivation or even just hope.

Good luck friend"

LogitechG,fd587cd,t1_fcxhrgi,1578175098.0,"Ohh so it looks like when I try storing the settings on the mouse, it only allows basic mouse buttons and keystrokes. When I store settings on my computer (""automatic game detection"") I get loads of different features for the buttons. Didn't realize that.

Thanks for the reply :)"
DepressionRecovery,fd27sbj,t3_ejumwh,1578143031.0,"Hm can't say for sure what's right, but I feel like sometimes in these situations you have to force yourself to do interesting things even if they're outside your comfort zone and even if you don't feel particularly enthusiastic about it. At least, for me, I find that I oftentimes don't want to do things but when I do, I never regret it. Sort of just fake it till you make it - fake the enthusiasm and you'll realize it'll actually start becoming your own. Going out and doing things that interest you is also how you can meet new people - another daunting task but the good things don't come easy. Maybe you'll meet 99 people and not click with any of them, but the 100th person becomes a friend. Just gotta keep putting yourself out there, keep working for that future you want.

Also if you want some motivation in life, I find humans love to feel productive and work towards a goal. So set goals for yourself as to what you want in life - probably all of our first goal is to get to the point where one day we can look back and leave our depressed selves in the past, and be proud that we've learned how to live a fulfilling life. And set smaller, more achievable goals every day so that you feel like you're making progress and accomplishing things every day.

Sorry, my thoughts were pretty unorganized there and I don't know if this is the ideal way of thinking of things but this is sort of my thought on it.

Good luck friend :)"
depression_memes,fcv83rn,t3_ei7xwc,1577996610.0,Word for word what I was thinking!! A few more years is doable for me but 60 more sounds like way too much..
selfimprovement,fbuyy3c,t3_eems6w,1577122650.0,"I think another small reason that I found with myself is that when you look at yourself in the mirror, it's a reflected image of yourself. Any slight asymmetry (e.g. if your hair is parted on one side, one eye is slightly differently slanted than another, etc) appears on the opposite side of the mirror compared to in real life. You're usually closely analyzing yourself in the mirror and so you get very used to these asymmetries. When you see a picture of yourself, everything is the normal way (not reversed like a mirror) and so it's not what you expect of yourself since you see yourself in the mirror so much and so you look extremely weird to yourself.

To see if this is the problem with you, try taking a picture of yourself using the selfie camera and then using the front camera. The selfie camera reverses the image like a mirror does. That's how I first noticed it - when my brother took a selfie of himself, I found he looked a tiny bit odd but he thought he looked normal. When I took the same picture but with the back camera, I thought he looked normal but he thought he looked really weird.

And on a side note, looks are nice but you can be the ugliest person and have everything that you could ever desire. You can easily be more happy than a lot of ""good looking"" people. So it's easier said than done but try not to dwell on it I think and look to improve yourself as a person.

Just my opinion, good luck 😊"
