While she could change her mind, and is perfectly allowed too, I don't think OP should base making this workout on the idea that she could possibly change her mind in the future."
relationships,ffyamti,t3_evvont,1580341905.0,"People can know though. I have many friends who know for sure they do or don't want kids. 

While nobody can for sure say they will have kids, you can absolutely plan and ensure you never have kids. 

If you don't honestly don't know and it's her deal breaker you need to just say you can't make a choice either way and then let the breakup happen. It isn't terrible that you don't know. But if you cannot say you know either way then that is just your truth and you need to let this relationship go."

If there is a moment that feels right maybe lean in and say you would love to kiss her or ask if she wants to kiss you. There is nothing more sexy then consent, making sure you are on the same page... And kissing! Haha"

askwomenadvice,ffugzhn,t1_ffu9b4d,1580241750.0,Thank you. Solid. That feels appropriate to say without coming across as overly feeling/hurt. Thank you.

In my experience just ignoring issues leads to burning bridges or letting the issues linger. I just don't know how to best discuss with him.

Ghosting in our circles describes what he did. I get that it's defined differently then my area uses it."
