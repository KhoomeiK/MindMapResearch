mildlyinteresting,fckdenj,t1_fcjju8j,1577722826.0,"Yeah realize it my last post could just come off as random word salad so let me try to put it as easily as possible. 

The King county metro system has approximately 230 routes, assuming each route has a hundred stops each, that's 23,000 in the system. Each bench cost maybe $10,000 and each small structure upwards to $50,000... Yeah they're way more expensive than you expect. So if you were to structure all stops that's $1,380,000,000. That kind of money you just don't have. Whereas just paying for 20% of your stops and focus in heavy traffic areas that brings that total cost down to 267,000,000."
nevertellmetheodds,fcj5r28,t1_fci4bdi,1577677942.0,it's 6969 6969 6969 6969 and 420
mildlyinteresting,fch8xnl,t1_fch24zl,1577648363.0,The metro bus system is probably the best in the world and they try to keep that kind of infrastructure too busy stops. Any ruro stops and housing is just a basic stop like this. It makes sense cost wise as well. Paying for just 20% of your stops to have seating and cover makes a lot more sense then paying for 100% especially when you have thousands of stops.
