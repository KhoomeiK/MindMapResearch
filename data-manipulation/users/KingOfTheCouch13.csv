WouldYouRather,fgiqsd7,t1_fgietgq,1580828809.0,Tricking sometime into thinking your a good guy just to have sex with them is bad but still not as bad as brainwashing them solely for your physical pleasure.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fghrbk5,t1_fghqb0j,1580791678.0,"That's not really how it works. Ive heard of people cheating and still taking everything in divorce. Unless both parties are reasonable and willing participants, divorce can get ugly no matter who was at wrong."

GooglePixel,fg6mcii,t3_ex7e6j,1580571711.0,Between this month and next month target has done a $450 discount on the latest pixel the last 2 years.

GooglePixel,fg4xhew,t3_ewwvsh,1580513296.0,I have been going through the same thing! You'd think google at least had the search function down. It's had several major errors since last year when Android 10 beta came out.
AskReddit,fg3a44f,t1_fg2owri,1580475835.0,"Some processes and concepts fade out with new technology. For example with autonomous cars 100 years from now, we won't need traffic lights, signs, or lane markings. Hell even traffic cops and car insurance may cease to exist because accidents and poor driving will be pretty nonexistent. If the aliens had teleporters, they may have a much more advanced process for organization that doesn't resemble ours, called flump."

facepalm,ffth05k,t1_fft4dm9,1580220288.0,Tbh I'd love a feature that allows you to download entire threads to read for later offline. Just no need to print it lol.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffsb3iy,t1_ffrjyc2,1580177502.0,"Yeah they don't. It's just that when legends do die it's well past their era so the current generation doesn't realize how impactful they really were. If Michael Jordan does in 20yrs, me and you will say he was a legend. But the kids of that day will look at him like kids in 2006 looked at James brown."

Whatcouldgowrong,ff9csgj,t1_ff9aukn,1579710106.0,You seem a little too upset over some people online who misunderstood whats happening in a 10 second video.
nothingeverhappens,ff9cf68,t1_ff72oso,1579709825.0,Yeah everyone in that thread seems to be overreacting. If it is or isn't scripted its supposed to be a light-hearted clip. I guys some people will argue over everything though.
