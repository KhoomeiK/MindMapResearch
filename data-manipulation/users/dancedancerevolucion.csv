creepy,ffocnu6,t1_ffnn1mk,1580076305.0,"It's a bigger issue than that. Many people will have loved ones who were very friendly and happy who became bitter and mean with dementia. Part of it is also from the frustration; Imagine having ""tip of the tongue"" but for broad strokes of your life, your loved ones, yourself. Suddenly being incapable of a tasks you've done all your life.  The fear of not knowing where you are, who people are and why they won't let you do what you feel you need. 

It's not just adapting to being in a facility."
AskMen,ffo26ii,t1_ffkpu1f,1580073409.0,"This is an old post but wanted to add to yours:

As a woman the idea of my partner getting into a fight is absolutely terrifying. Even if you're a big and burly dude you never know what the other person has. Additionally what happens if you do go down? What if the fight doesn't stop when you do? I now have to try and physically protect you cause there's no way I could ever leave. Pride can take a few blows, my body can't. 

It speaks way more as a partner to ensure everyone's safety than to start a fight over pride."

He grew up down the street from the owner and randomly put one on the truck as a joke when he was a pre-teen. The guy spent forever trying to figure out who it was but also refused to remove it. When it started fading my boyfriend swapped it with a new one. When he went into the army he convinced the guy's kids to do it for him while he was gone.

Scams,ffcmjdq,t1_ffc5mkq,1579802622.0,"My ex fell for this too. Random really pretty girl with an obvious professional photo added him on Facebook and started chatting with him. It barely made sense and was basically her being cutesy.  She had like three photos and seven friends. I told him it was a scam playing off him being young, dumb and hormonal and he came back with ""but she knows my dad!"".

She mentioned his dad's name, which is listed under relations on his profile, and some other various info that you could easily pull. He never questioned how someone 30 years his dad's junior and from another state could know his hermit like dad. I finally asked his dad who confirmed he had no idea who it was and that it was probably a scam. 

We broke up around that time and he called me in a panic asking what people could and couldn't track online, some bullshit about if the FBI would send emails and questions about links sent by other people. I checked and ""she"" was off his profile at that point and a bunch of his stuff was suddenly on lock down."

They knew the man well enough to be comfortable letting him into their new home in a sketchy area late at night. When she hangs up to ""talk"" things quickly get heated and one or more of the kids try to intervene, possibly being familiar and feeling somewhat safe with the man while still protective of their single mom. Things reach a peak and it is now a battle between the family trying to protect one another, and the assailant. 

The twins while still young were at that age where they can begin to feel responsible for their family or that they need to be the man of the house; I also wouldn't be surprised if they were very protective of one another. 

The older sister was only a year and some change older than the boys so I am sure she was not only very close to the boys but felt responsible for them as well.
