leagueoflegends,ffqxolo,t1_ffqui8b,1580145980.0,"Law follows from culture, it's a perfectly fair comparison. Without rules, there can be no cheating to begin with.

I'm not sure we're staying on the same topic here, since there's already been some issues communicating. If you define encouraging as requiring an explicit support, rather than circumstances, sure, nowhere encourages cheating, because nowhere, anywhere, can encourage breaking their own rules, since if you explicitly support something, it's an understood part of those rules.

But, to be frank, that's a meaningless distinction, and that should clue you in that they mean something else."
leagueoflegends,ffqsc0l,t1_ffqp2aa,1580142512.0,"Easily.

For instance, lax enforcement of rules encourages abuse. That doesn't mean the abuse is condoned, because then those abuses would have been made part of the rules to begin with. But conditions encourage that behavior.

So, for instance, the US approach to certain drugs encourages their spread. Not because the government won't nail you if you're caught, or wants you to use them, but because it's not a high priority, and the drugs in question are largely destigmatized. You can buy weed-themed merchandise everywhere, to start.

So, not legal or desired, but conditions encourage the act."
leagueoflegends,ffqc92r,t1_ffpr6py,1580130055.0,I think it's you who is misunderstanding here. There's a fair difference between encouraging and condoning. Encouraging something isn't always intended or desired.
