bipolar,ffis548,t3_ett0gh,1579981347.0,"I thought it was your home. But unmistakably this is truly inspiring. I was diagnosed last year at 36. I’ve spent a lot of time crying and upset but prior to my diagnosis I decided to go back to school and it’s the best decision I’ve made. I just have a great deal of grief for all the years lost and I don’t know how to process that and take the reigns of life right now. My family was intended to be my support structure, but I find I get more grief and lack of understanding from them. It’s like, “Cool! You’re taking some medications. Who cares. Everyone has their own problems.” What’s worse is I’ve been taking care of myself and my parents for the last 4-5 years and eventually I crumbled 2 years ago. Recently my sister had a baby and so there’s some joy in the family, but turns out my “bullshit” won’t be tolerated anymore. Going back to school has been mentally difficult. Body issues. Age issues. Amazing friends. Great courses. It all has been an overall good experience. But I can’t see beyond the week. In a year I’ve done a lot, but can’t wait to see what the next year has in store for me. I’m just taking it a moment at a time. Thanks for the inspiration. Hopefully I’ll have a home like this one day."
HairTransplants,ffiqxrh,t3_eknfof,1579980495.0,Is it the MedHairClinic? I spoke to them and the price seems good but I wasn’t so happy with the hairlines their patients have. They look really artificial/obvious. I’ve seen other Canadian clinics’ work and it seems more natural. But I wish you luck!
bipolar,ffiqnac,t3_etl6mr,1579980290.0,As long as its not the pokey.

Biochemistry,ff56w85,t3_erla7v,1579581957.0,"This happened at a university I worked at. The PI was a terribly demanding person and essentially pushed his post-docs (all Indians) to work harder even after bringing in better and better work. Eventually, I was hired as a tech and brought on to help one of the post-docs and the workload only expanded. I was working the same hours as the post-doc because the culture in the lab was that we work for our PI to get results. Not money. 

So I eventually had to take a weekend off and requested it well in advance. But the work still needed to be done, so I ended up working almost every day leading up to the weekend from 9 am till 1 am preparing experiments so I could run them overnight. And then I took 3 days off in 5 months. I was always in and out of the lab and eventually, I couldn’t take it anymore. The breaking point was my laptop got stolen from the lab and the PI wouldn’t claim the loss because his insurance would go up. I filed a police report, and lost a $2000 laptop, but the PI was more worried about his data than an employee/student losing this amount of money. I also wasn’t being paid for a month and a half. This was because I was being promised a contract as a tech but the situation was that I was originally a student in the summer. When fall term began, I was asked to hold on, and I would be made a tech. Eventually I stopped going to the lab and was fired. They paid me the money they owed me, but because it was all accumulated in one pay period I lost a larger amount to taxes. I was also yelled at by the PI when I came and visited the lab with assurances from PhDs that it would be okay, as they were trying to mend the situation. Worst. Employment. Experience. Ever. 

Go into another industry. Government is way better. Private is way better pay. Working in research is a lost cause. Especially because the competitiveness is to publish in a reputable journal. Science. Nature. PNAS. It was a horrible experience to see that the people you looked up to did not value the people who worked for them and paid them slave wages. I would work for somewhere between $2.50 and $3.40 an hour with the stipend I received weekly. And this was a full time job for me."

McMaster,ff2heac,t3_er6ecy,1579506227.0,The guy before WillyDog was way better.
worldpolitics,fep8kq3,t3_eq6pyk,1579314558.0,There’s still time.

bipolar,feiuotl,t1_feiujmj,1579147704.0,I have an aquarium. The fish don’t really care.
bipolar,feiuijm,t1_feituhz,1579147571.0,No risk of fire there. #toosoon?
bipolar,feit6ft,t1_feisyop,1579146559.0,Haha. I sat a friend’s dog once and he was terribly clingy. He needed to sleep in the bed with me and eventually started humping my leg. It was honestly the worst. I ended up giving the dog back a day early to their neighbour. I have also seen dogs that are not as high strung. I would move a cocker spaniel (Spaniel Charles Cavalier).
Biochemistry,feisxt9,t3_ep6yev,1579146387.0,If you’re encountering an HR person they should know these details about their industry but it’s definitely appropriate to a different industry other than biochem.
