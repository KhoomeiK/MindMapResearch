Christianmarriage,ffgyins,t1_ffgy14u,1579918344.0,"That article that you just linked to says that women have more responsibilities (which equates to more stress), but are also *better at handling their stress*. Which is the opposite of what you said."
Christianmarriage,ffgxmjd,t1_fff0d18,1579917681.0,"""Women do not handle stress as well as men"" is nonsense."
GradSchool,ffgrmlw,t1_ffgh8hn,1579913295.0,That's amazing—congratulations!!
GradSchool,ff4mh6p,t3_erj4gc,1579567184.0,"I know this doesn't solve your issue, but I want to point out that it sounds like the people who really matter recognize the good work that you do. You wouldn't have passed your comprehensive, or had research scholarships all of these years, or have your role on the review papers you're working on, if there weren't people recognizing your abilities, saw the good work you have done, and believing in you and your intelligence."

writing,ff47ch4,t1_ff2gg2n,1579557134.0,Absolutely.
writing,ff476w5,t1_ff20nrr,1579557036.0,"I'm glad that somebody mentioned this. Sometimes people have stories that they make up in their heads, get invested in, and want to write; it's about the story more than it is about the writing."
GradSchool,ff3gly4,t1_ff1t3uo,1579540618.0,Thanks :-)
GradSchool,ff15dxb,t1_fepdqyo,1579475398.0,Thanks :D

GradSchool,feousli,t1_feosz9n,1579305898.0,"Since you posted it here, I'm assuming you also passed your thesis defense yesterday . . . ? Congratulations!"
GradSchool,feoupnf,t1_feo16x5,1579305848.0,That sounds like a wonderful feeling—keep up the good work!
GradSchool,feoukqs,t1_feo9o4h,1579305764.0,How do you calculate a percentage complete for your dissertation?

GradSchool,feou4en,t1_fenkyw0,1579305557.0,"Ooh! Do you have fun/exciting weekend plans, or is simple relaxation and recharging on the decks?"
GradSchool,feotz5n,t3_eq4jhu,1579305470.0,"I finally got my mark for the course that I took last semester, the course that always ended up at the bottom of the priority list, without adequate time reserved for readings and assignments . . . and I got an A!"
GradSchool,fekaoi3,t3_epgqnw,1579196099.0,"I agree with the other poster that you are likely not going to solve this via Reddit. However, r/PersonalFinanceCanada would be more likely to have ideas for you than r/GradSchool"
GradSchool,fek9wpv,t1_fek7do8,1579195648.0,"I'm not trying to be kind, I am saying what I believe to be true."
GradSchool,fek36tp,t1_fejppds,1579191639.0,How many courses do you need? What if courses you want are not offered in your first year?
GradSchool,fek1t17,t3_epjhvk,1579190789.0,"I don't think asking for help is a sign of weakness, I think it is a sign of *strength*. I admire when people figure out where they need help, and seek the help that they need."
getdisciplined,fea1xiw,t1_fe9ml1e,1578943511.0,It might even be *necessary* to focus on just one thing at a time. That's how actual progress gets made. Humans aren't generally very good at multi-tasking.
GetMotivated,fe92bt6,t3_en3b2s,1578933379.0,"I encourage you to broaden your gratitude practice to include finding new details of things that you are grateful for every day. I like to write these things down in a type of gratitude journal, but the main point is being specific and creative when you think about what you're grateful for. Mine are usually related to things that are going on in my life at the time; if I was cold outside, I might be particularly grateful for the warmth of my apartment; if I witnessed an accident scene, I might write down something about being grateful for first responders; if I'm feeling particularly happy about something, I might be deliberately grateful for elements that led to that happiness."
GradSchool,fe5inat,t3_enumv1,1578869930.0,"I also would like to develop this skill, and am interested in what suggestions you might get here. What I've found most useful so far is taking some time away from the particular piece of writing, and then printing out a hard copy, sitting down, and going through it with a coloured gel pen, making notes of things that seem to be working well, things that maybe don't actually make sense, ways that things might be reworded to be clearer or smoother, etc."
GradSchool,fdwtgtj,t3_en8s4m,1578762182.0,My masters was much more similar to my PhD (currently first year PhD) than to my undergrad.

SubredditAdoption,fdsi6f3,t1_fdsfkds,1578703212.0,That sounds like it could become a fun sub to browse.

SubredditAdoption,fdsg876,t1_fdsey4w,1578702096.0,What do you want the sub to be about?
GradSchool,fdrnxhr,t1_fdqtsos,1578687226.0,Oh I like this idea! Numbers on a physical calendar + a graph on the computer sounds perfect.
books,fdo5knw,t1_fdny1zc,1578599285.0,People today are essentially the same as they were in Shakespeare's time. A lot of classics have valuable lessons about the human condition which are as relevant today as they were then.
GradSchool,fdnnohe,t3_emc7h3,1578589561.0,"I don't know what you should do in this situation re: applying or how you should talk to this prof and/or your advisor about the situation, but I strongly urge you not to lie. Be tactful, but do not lie."
GradSchool,fdldbxo,t1_fdl7ng3,1578521591.0,Maybe it is time for OP to write a book.
