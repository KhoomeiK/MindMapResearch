This means that pill and sow bugs would have no problem living in an old mining area that might be contaminated with lead, cadmium, arsenic or other toxins. While this may seem like a great way to clean up contaminated land, the heavy metals do not actually leave the area. Instead they are just concentrated in the pill and sow bugs. Once the bugs die, those toxins would likely go back into the soil.

If you did mean MD, then /u/busybody1 got it pretty much, biomechanics.

If you're just starting a path though, then in 10 years I'd imagine it would move in a similar fashion to VR/AR - you could work on integrated haptic-feedback controllers (perhaps neuro-integrated in 20 years) or some version of body modifications/medicine administration.

There are two one-way highways of nerves in your body (sympathetic and parasympathetic). When a big, scary monster comes, tons of chemicals like adrenaline go down the first highway. This helps you run away or beat up the bad guy.

But after that's done, the chemicals can't go backwards on the highway. So the second highway sends a bunch of different chemicals like noradrenaline (inventive, right?) which help make the body normal again. Since you can only add to the situation, usually the second highway needs to flood the adrenaline with a counterpart so your body doesn't burn itself out. That's the noradrenaline that makes you sleepy."
