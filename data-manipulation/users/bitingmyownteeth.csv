[God Damn The Sun](https://youtu.be/5jpVtYQIols)

[Verse]

When, when we were young

We had no history, so nothing to lose

Meant we could choose, choose what we wanted then

Without any fear or thought of revenge

But then you grew old, and I lost my ambition

So I gained an addiction, to drink and depression

They are mine, my only true friends

And I'll keep them with me until the very end

I'd choose not to remember, but I miss your arrogance

And I need your intelligence, and your hate for authority

But now you're gone, I read it today

They found you in Spain, face down in the street

With a bottle in your hand and a wild smile on your face

And a knife in your back, you died in a foreign land

And they found my letter rolled up in your pocket

Where I said I'd kill myself if she left me again

So now she's gone, and you're both in my mind

I've got one thing to say before I am drunk again

[Outro]

God damn the sun

God damn the sun

God damn anyone

That says a kind word

God damn the sun

God damn the sun

God damn the light it shines

And this world it shows

God damn the sun"
