SuicideWatch,ffeoeud,t1_ffem2iw,1579857285.0,Exactly. I’ve had people tell me “oh so you want to take the easy way out” in a really condescending tone and it really made me wonder lol. Like yes I’m a spineless weak person what do you care?
NCT,ff9cmp3,t1_ff968nx,1579709984.0,"I actually had a hard time watching this lol. I think what you see at the left on the side of the street at 08:10 in the video is what really made me think what kind of (to me) surreal setting it is.

I think in a way they are probably used to it, but whenever I see people following them around all day I can't help but wonder if such fans ask themselves why they do that; don't they have other things to do? I suppose this is not as bad as airplane stalking but there's a very fine line between them (got me thinking of Haechan lol)"
NCT,ff7gjur,t3_ers3v9,1579649042.0,I know this is standard for kpop but the amount of bodyguards and fans/fansites following them around still fascinates me
Interpol,feahj70,t3_eoa4qh,1578948849.0,Top two albums I'll listen on the train on my way to school. It's incredible how the music intensifies my sadness and consoles me at the same time.
NCT,fe4g3bk,t3_en5i0h,1578858941.0,Haechan kissing his hyungs and their reactions lolol
twinpeaks,fczddtc,t3_ejm9r8,1578098687.0,Thank you for this!  I didn't know he had written this. This was really insightful and in a way articulated what I had been thinking of the show yet couldn't properly formulate for myself. I wish he would still be around too.
SuicideWatch,fcn8qqt,t1_fcn6oln,1577806175.0,"I suppose it differs per person but I see it like this: in some way I emotionally compensate the fact that I utterly despise myself, by romanticising and fixating on someone else (or a fantasy of myself). In short, one way or another you're gonna try to let that person or your relationship with that person compensate for your lacking relationship with yourself, which will usually end up in co-dependent relationships or having unfair and unrealistic expectations of that person (because in a way, you probably have those of yourself too)."
Got7,fcmphie,t1_fcmjjyk,1577785767.0,"I wonder if he will be part of the first day of shooting since Gayo Daejejeon is tonight (in like 2 hours)? So maybe he did before that during the day but that seems like a lot. Then again, idol schedules are a lot

Edit cause I misread your comment: I’m not sure about this but even though they use the solar calendar I don’t think NYE is that big of a deal in South-Korea compared to Western countries. Or maybe they had to start today for some kind of logistical/contractual reason"
SuicideWatch,fcit7v6,t1_fcilul5,1577669241.0,"yep. I haven't read it yet, but I bought it recently so I hope to start reading it soon. Even if it's just for a moment, reading familiar painful thoughts is comforting in a way."
SuicideWatch,fcijbgh,t1_fcie006,1577663502.0,"David Foster-Wallace. He wrote a book about (his) depression right? Is this quote from that?

Edit: found it."
unpopularkpopopinions,fcefjn6,t3_eh3xhm,1577620032.0,"I really wonder what you all mean with “returning to HYYH/YNWA for the next comeback”. 

Trying to replicate the feeling would be silly, it’s like making a sequal to the biggest success which is a flop pretty much always (if not proft-wise then creatively), and I’m certain both BTS and BH know this. I assume that’s why they’ve continuously been making new/different stuff (which HYYH/YNWA were as well) which was/is a good decision, it  just didn’t result in good music imo.

So I don’t really understand what is meant with this phrase. Could someone elaborate?"
