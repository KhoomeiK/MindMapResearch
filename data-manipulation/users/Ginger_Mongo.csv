To anyone who reads this post, just remember that it’s rare :) The most common type of meningitis is viral meningitis and even though the symptoms can feel scary, it is hardly ever fatal and will fade away just like a cold. The second most common form of it (bacterial meningitis) is also prevented by a vaccine that most people have had."

ZeroEscape,fcjjnua,t3_ehinus,1577690250.0,"I just recently found out about a visual novel called ‘Raging Loop’ and it is enjoyable so far! There aren’t any puzzles or anything like that I believe, but there is sort of a flow chart in which you will need to have certain endings in order to unlock some choices (similar to the ones in ZE). This also ties in with the second similarity, which is how the MC is able to retain information about something from another timeline/ending but I’m assuming it’s because the MC is in a time loop (hence the title). 

The story is interesting. It has an eerie feeling, or at least it does for me. It basically revolves around Japanese folklore and spirits. There also seems to be a sort of Town of Salem thing going on but I’m not sure if we will be able to make decisions during those moments. I actually want to ramble more about it but I don’t want to give out too much that could some aspects if you are interested:)
