Black athletes, actors, musicians, inventors etc have made their mark and proven that you can succeed in this country. Given that, I feel it's more likely that they have people reminding them that they are victims. That's another beef I have with democratic policies and leaders. Instead of aiming to lift inner cities out of poverty, they want them to stay dependent on the government and remind them of their victimhood. I'm not saying that's the end-all be-all on the matter but those voices are certainly out there and it's not healthy. I think it's apparent when, in 2020, we're still treating poor inner cities with this almost nauseating patriarchal oversight. Something seems off."

todayilearned,ff9o992,t3_esasvv,1579717146.0,"The context here is a little fuzzy. OP makes it out to seem like the captain just had the ultimate gall to ask for more ammunition from his opponent. Upon reading the story, the Norse captain sent an envoy to basically dap up the opposing captain for a good duel, and quite possibly joking about acquiring more ammo. After the request was denied, they both drank to eachother's health and went their own ways. This seems to me like a genius move by the Norse captain to avoid being capsized, but who knows."

OfficeDepot,ff8gtjc,t3_es4uzf,1579677848.0,"This is partly why I left. Full-time, according to Depot, is 32 hours or more per week. I was getting told I couldn't go to school - that I needed full availability if I wanted to be a full-timer. The hours were being cut from everywhere. Only 2-3 people at a time. Office Depot wants customers to be physically chaperoned to the items they're looking for (which explains the no aisle numbers) yet they can't afford the payroll required to make this happen. 
One day my friend told me he could land me a job with him. That same day at work, I was helping a customer with a printer when a slew of customers started to pour in for our noon rush. We had 1 person in CPD, 1 cashier, myself, and a lazy store manager hiding in his office. Register gets packed, nobody to flex up. CPD has its daily line already formed, and I radio to the SM I need backup on the floor. He radios back ""ah.. it's going to have to be you, man. I'm tied up."" In other words, customers can wait. Meanwhile, I hear a voice by the ink section belt out a helpless, yet aggressive ""hello?!""
So I tell the customer waiting behind my printer customer that someone will be out as soon as possible, so I don't have to hear her huffing and puffing. As I do this, printer customer gets offended that I acknowledged another customer with the douchiest ""ugh.. are you going to focus on me now?""
At this point, I took a deep breath, cracked a smile, and said ""just a moment"" as I took off for the break room. Took off my badge, threw it in the trash along with my shirt, put my radio on the charger and walked out. SM called me twice, sent his ass to VM. I don't get paid 600 measly dollars biweekly to deal with this nightmare."
