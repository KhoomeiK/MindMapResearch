Virginity is a social construct and you can define it personally how every you like. There is not technically about it."
tipofmyjoystick,ffev32t,t1_ffe00mi,1579866817.0,Got it in one! Thank you so much! Now I get to spend the afternoon watching gameplay videos and basking in nostalgia. You are the best.
oddlysatisfying,ffdzfpf,t3_et16pi,1579832766.0,What? Can I actually have a job where I do this?
politicalcartoons,ffcjk8z,t3_esw2xh,1579800825.0,I really don’t understand why she said that. What was she hoping to achieve. It’s pretty fucking obvious he is popular. She can’t be that far up her own ass to see that.

twioat,ff9l2dq,t1_ff86nlh,1579715257.0,Honestly I thought that was the best part of the movie. Liza rocked it. It’s pure boredom after that.
theocho,ff2jex1,t1_ff1tr43,1579508835.0,So many awesome videos from that period of their lives.
accidentallycommunist,feyks2q,t3_eqtyjj,1579446916.0,“Anticop” “antifreedom”. Isn’t that a contradiction of terms.
accidentallycommunist,feykghe,t1_fexb5cz,1579446747.0,It is but personally I don’t like it. Reminds me too much of the 88 nazi dog whistle and all that. I try to avoid hinting at my politics views and say them out right instead. All Cops Are Bastards by the way.

worldnews,fenvbjn,t1_fenu4md,1579291431.0,I don’t really mind either way. It would be mildly more convenient to have the euro but then I would have to get used to another damn currency so swings and roundabouts and all that. And everyone is always welcome for some hygge. :D
worldnews,fentu1q,t1_fenb0eu,1579290673.0,The Danish Crown is pegged to the euro anyway. It’s one of the reasons we get away with it. Functionally we pretty much might as well be using the euro. But then there might not be cute little hearts on our coins and that would suck.
worldnews,fenstbo,t1_fen1bjt,1579290206.0,Not sure about Sweden but the Danish Krone is pegged to the euro. So we are pretty much using the euro anyway except I have to change money when ever I visit Germany.
worldnews,fenrnsq,t1_femwnrt,1579289755.0,I have a feeling that reentering the EU will be just as much of an expensive shit storm as leaving has been as we will be so stubborn in trying to get as good a deal as we had when that deal does not exist anymore.
LeopardsAteMyFace,fejdnp7,t1_feitgq6,1579168916.0,They totally are. My dad said he would have voted for Bernie in the last one. Now during the past 3 years he has been totally poisoned by Alt-right media. If I even bring up Bernie now he has 2 or 3 new bullshit claim about him that he will spout as if they are facts.
worldnews,fef242h,t3_eolof1,1579046376.0,As a smoker I’m pretty okay with this. But I think it would be better if everyone just got a few 5 minute brakes through out the day. It honestly helps my productivity.

COMPLETEANARCHY,feae44m,t3_eo6uc0,1578947484.0,It’s so fucking annoying. I love the comedy that this guy has made and then all of a sudden he doesn’t even think it’s possible for me to exist.

COMPLETEANARCHY,fe41tx4,t3_eno01o,1578854983.0,You don’t retire so you can have a good time and you don’t retire because you have earned it. You retire because you no longer have a use in capitalism and it’s not really appropriate to just kill you.
tifu,fe3sq5y,t1_fe3oe3n,1578852539.0,It’s not even considered pedophilia when they are post pubescent. It’s called ephebophilia and it’s pretty normal and natural. Pretty much ubiquitous actually. The problem is not that the person is physical attractive but that they are not mentally old enough and it would be taking advantage of them.

worldnews,fdqbgib,t3_emlovi,1578662051.0,I had an old employer try and do this. It’s illegal here in Europe. I was not very popular with the upper management when I pointed it out during the meeting where they tried to implement it. I got a “siding with the management” conversation afterwards. Quit a few months later.

sports,fd5s7lc,t1_fd5rfgu,1578180899.0,I used to play American Football. If anyone other than a captain speaks to the ref they could be ejected. You always treat them with respect. Same in rugby. I’ve never seen anyone treat a ref like that in ice hockey. Only maybe tennis? But even then there are repercussions.
sports,fd5551g,t3_ejyo49,1578174250.0,I hate how the step so closely to the referees in soccer. If you did that in any other sport you would be out of the game straight away but in soccer it’s the norm. It gives me anxiety to watch them act like that.

todayilearned,fcws0ie,t1_fcwhyx7,1578035274.0,I went to a catholic school in the UK. It was pretty well known that the more obviously religious students would get better grades with certain teachers and those of us that were openly not religious would have a harder time. Teachers can be awful.

mildlyinteresting,fcl6j19,t1_fckg23y,1577740877.0,I can’t even stand working in an open kitchen never mind ones with mirrors. Chefs are weird. We do weird shit while we are working. We can’t do weird shit when the covers are sat there watching us so instead we slowly go insane.
