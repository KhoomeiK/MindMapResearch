Causes

The causes of pedophilia (and other paraphilias) are not known. There is some evidence that pedophilia may run in families, though it is unclear whether this stems from [genetics](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/genetics) or learned behavior.

A history of [childhood](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/child-development) sexual abuse is another potential factor in the development of pedophilias, although this has not been proven. Behavioral learning models suggest that a child who is the victim or observer of inappropriate sexual behaviors may become conditioned to imitate these same behaviors. These individuals, deprived of normal social and sexual contacts, may seek gratification through less socially acceptable means.

Physiological models are investigating the potential relationship between [hormones](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/hormones) and behavior, particularly the role of [aggression](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger) and male sexual hormones. Pedophiles have been shown to be shorter on average and are more likely to be left-handed, as well as to have lower IQs than the general population. Brain scans indicate that they have less white matter—the connective circuitry in the brain—and at least one study has shown they are more likely to have suffered childhood head injuries than non-pedophiles.

Individuals may become aware of their sexual interest in children around the time of puberty. Pedophilia may be a lifelong condition, but pedophilic disorder includes elements that can change over time, including distress, psychosocial impairment, and an individual's tendency to act on urges."

Advice,feob0kr,t1_feo2bpd,1579297608.0,It's a very complicated issue. I posted my thoughts to OP: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/eq1won/my\_friend\_of\_5\_years\_was\_convicted\_of\_paedophilia/feo9ffp?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/eq1won/my_friend_of_5_years_was_convicted_of_paedophilia/feo9ffp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)
Advice,feoaro8,t1_feo7ikl,1579297471.0,We can't just go burning people at the stake because you THINK that  they raped kids. You obviously haven't read up on scholarly articles and studies about pedophilia and are obviously not involved in the legal system.

Advice,feo9ffp,t3_eq1won,1579296903.0,"I request that y'all hold back down-votes unless y'all feel I haven't contributed to the conversation. This is going to be pragmatic and controversial. If you disagree, please express so with a comment explaining why and even cite some evidence that's not anecdotal.   


\--------------

  
Consider the following:

1. this claim is currently unverified. If it's true, take a step back from the emotional response. Did they choose to be attracted to children? Did you choose to be attracted to people?  


2. If it's true remember: alcoholism is never cured, only managed. Do we distance ourselves from recovering alcoholics? I get that alcoholism is self inflicting, however, it's still a disease that never goes away - we can't control the desire only abstain from the behavior. Do we abandon alcoholics on their road to being pro-social?  


3. Pedophilia has been studied and, unless new evidence presented itself, is a sexual orientation that happens to be a perversion. Again, can you choose to be straight/gay/pan/bi/asexual/aromantic? No. In this case, they can choose to NOT ACT ON IT, but they can't stop how their brain works. This makes it complicated. It's literally not their fault how their brain works but they can be held responsible for their behavior. People also fear seeking help because of the potential consequences. Imagine if it was illegal to be attracted to who you're attracted to. How would you safely seek help? How could you cope?  


4. All people who have a mental disorder need a support system more so than an unaffiliated person. You can care about a person who is a pedophile just as you can care about a person who is a thief, an alcoholic, or someone convicted of involuntary manslaughter. 

5. Read this:  [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/08/what-can-be-done-about-pedophilia/279024/](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/08/what-can-be-done-about-pedophilia/279024/)   


While all is worth reading, here's a quote:

>**Sometimes people like David Goldberg, the author of the essay, are seen or referred to as ""gold star pedophiles"" or ""good pedophiles."" Can you explain what those seemingly incongruous terms mean?**  
>  
>It is extremely important not to confuse pedophilia—meaning the sexual interest in children—with actual child molestation. Not every person who experiences sexual attractions to children acts on those attractions. People who are pedophilic but who work to remain celibate their entire lives are being increasingly recognized as needing and deserving all the support society can give them.
