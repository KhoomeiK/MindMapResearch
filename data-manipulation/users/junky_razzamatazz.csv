Not that I have any studies on it or anything. I just think this because whenever you look up old interviews with actors or musicians, even going back to the 40s, they all have a list of stories about obsessed fans doing creepy or crazy shit. Robert Redford started cutting up clothes and pouring bleach in his trash because crazy fans kept stealing it and selling or wearing his old dirty shirts. Debbie Harry had someone who’d record speeches about her and play them on a stereo in her street. There are so many stories we probably never heard unless the celebrity affected happened to bring it up on Dick Cavett or Johnny Carson."

SubredditDrama,feg8kgd,t1_fedro0s,1579082199.0,"Here's my reasoning as a shoes-in-the-house person:

I live in sweltering tropical heat and high humidity. If everyone comes over and takes their shoes off, the entire house absolutely reeks of feet. Try having a dinner party when you can *taste* twelve different strains of foot juice in the air. It's better to keep shoes on until you take your cool shower at the end of the day, which we all do because otherwise you're taking a whole day's sweat and grime into bed with you each night. Because it's so consistently hot here there isn't much carpeting, and it takes very little effort to swish a mop through the house regularly and keep everything clean.

I've been to some homes that maintained a shoes-off policy, and they usually smelt of feet.

Some people here say it's gross to keep shoes on inside, but I always wonder how many of them take evening showers or wash their dog's feet. Because usually people say it's gross, but then take all their sweat and dirt from the day into their bed, which their dog has been jumping all over after pissing on its feet and running through dirt for hours. I've seen people whose dogs will eat shit (their own and other animals'), lick their feet, then walk all over the couches, beds, and carpets. Or indoor-outdoor cats who walk through filth and then climb all over the kitchen counters."

They’re 10 and 12 so they have like 50 hours of free time a week, when they came over for Christmas break they were finishing one of my games every 2 or 3 days.

As an adult I’ve gained more of an interest in shorter games I can beat in a reasonable timeframe with limited free time. I loved a 50 hour Final Fantasy growing up but now I love a tight solid 5-10 hour experience with no fat. And a lot of indie games like the ones Epic gives away suit that nicely."

So it becomes a point of pride in the local graffiti culture to say you've had something stay up on Hosier Lane for a long time. There used to be a Tumblr that took photos each week tracking the changes. Unfortunately it seems to have gone downhill the last few years.

Neither of those things are fun, but they still feel like valuable experiences to us by showing us what life is like for other people, providing stimulating emotions or thoughts that are incompatible with fun, etc. Why shouldn't interactive software be used for the same reasons? A realistic work simulator would be (generally) un-fun but for a short time it could be very interesting to see what life is like in different professions, maybe help us get a better understanding of the difficulties and challenges different people face, show us different paths we could have taken in life, and could be very emotional besides by forcing us to notice and experience dilemmas other professionals often face.

You can upload it yourself, but there’s a limit on the amount you can upload, so you can’t just dump your whole collection on there. The only solution is to check availability piece by piece for your whole collection to figure out what you should upload—and then you’re only good until the service loses something from its catalogue, which is happening more and more frequently.

Rachel’s haircut was a fad, they fully embrace a lot of fashion trends, they namedrop forgotten celebrities and watch Baywatch, etc. But it also feels more dated socially. Friends has more frequent “see men want the sex, women want the commitments” humor that feels really dated, the guys regularly panicking about gayness feels really dated, it highlights how the culture has changed in a way that Seinfeld doesn’t.

The gameplay is more of a mixed bag. It's absolutely a great game worth playing, it's just a question of whether it's better or worse than its predecessor. It trades off some level design and polish to achieve big, ambitious levels that interconnect. It has some of that Zelda design, where you'll encounter obstacles early on that you won't be able to bypass until you gain a new ability 10 hours in and backtrack to the starting area to re-explore it, now able to smash boulders or bomb walls or what have you. 

I think simply knowing that before you go in makes Banjo-Tooie more enjoyable. Part of the problem is that the game doesn't tell you it's doing this, so you can get frustrated spending half an hour trying to figure out some puzzle that isn't actually a puzzle at all, it's just an area of Level 1 you won't be able to access until late game. Many people had the natural instinct to 100%-complete a world before moving onto the next and that's impossible.

But when that feature is used well, it can add a lot to the feeling of a large, interconnected world that these characters actually inhabit, making you feel like it's no longer just a series of isolated platforming courses. It's nice to help a character late for his train in one world, repair the train station in the next, then go to another and meet the character getting off at the connected train station for a new chapter. Or to have things fall off the clouds in the sky level and actually land on the ground in another level, with characters in both areas commenting on it."
