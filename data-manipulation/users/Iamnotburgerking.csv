Not how taxonomy works. Modern taxonomy (as opposed to the outdated Linnean classification of life) is based on evolutionary relationships, not anatomical differences that are relatively superficial. No matter how much change happens, a lineage can’t become a complete separate group from the group that lineage arose from.

All land vertebrates and their descendants ARE fish due to evolving from a lineage of fish.

> Tazzie devils do actively hunt, but are dominantly scavengers

I keep seeing this thrown around without any sort of primary data to support it.  This seems to be yet another iteration of the “spotted hyenas are scavengers” myth. 

> There are tons of large bodied flightless scavengers

None of them actually rely primarily on scavenging, being either generalist omnivores or large predators instead. 

> its part of the reason why carcasses are so hard to find in nature

Actually this lack of carcasses is why there aren’t any large-bodied flightless scavengers. None of them can actually rely on that carrion as a reliable food source (due to lack of availability). They won’t pass up carrion if they happen to find one, but they don’t get that chance that often (at an individual level), so are forced to hunt or forage. 

> You just have to have a really good sense of smell, which Tazzie devils do.

Aside from the fact a keen sense of smell is more of a predator trait, it doesn’t matter how good your nose if if there are not enough carcasses around to feed yourself reliably.

> ""Tasmanian devils can take prey up to the size of a small kangaroo, but in practice they are opportunistic and eat carrion more often than they hunt live prey.""

You’re incorrectly assuming that terror birds were all one build and were doing fine before 2.5MYA, when there were many terror bird builds and all but one of them had been already rendered nonviable by that point (and that one remaining build, *Titanis*, wasn’t doing that well either due to climatic reasons). So whatever set them down on the path to nonviability had nothing to do with raccoons. Granted, other procyonids were around and actually entered South America by the Late Miocene, but the data we have indicates they failed to have much of an impact in South America.

Yes, because that’s the logic behind the “terror birds became nonviable because their spawn points kept getting raided” idea-the supposed raiders being placental mammals. 

If a build’s spawn points keep getting raided that build flat-our can’t exist in the first place due to lack of spawns. Since terror birds existed, and since they were in South and later North America (both of which had many builds that could presumably attempt to raid spawn points), this wasn’t that big of a problem for them.
