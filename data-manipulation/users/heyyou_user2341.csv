There's also making good friends after moving (They're way better than the peeps at my home town), and even finding out how good I'm at on the drums and guitar. It turns out most of them were sad, so I helped them out with their problems, and now they gave me a reason to live. I'd also miss out on telling you that your life matters, it may seem hallow but it really does. Live life, it's yours, not God's, not your parents\~Yours, and explore it. Make friends. Eat like shit in that restaurant, date her/him; I could just think of 100 reasons, and maybe that wouldn't be enough.   
Life may suck for now, but you can't have a happy life without the sad times."

She was getting better until her boyfriend cheated on her, and then put her anger out on me. I then also helped her out again. Two weeks pass by, and then she got better; Although I tried to tell her how her day was, but she just fucking acted as if I wanted to have sex with her, even though I was more into men than women. Fuck, all I did was help her and then she tried to convince me that life wasn't worth living. She moved now, and she hasn't still apologized, and we haven't talked in three months. Glad that's over."

AskReddit,ffvyvmp,t3_ev5zdg,1580277649.0,"This story may be a little complicated. I was 16, it's now October 2018. I was tired of being isolated, pill addicted and all my parents do was fight, hollar and drugs. Then, because of that I have developed psychosis and due to their arguments throughout my life. So back to October, I had the balls to attempt to summon a demon, yes I was that lonely. I thought it worked, and I could she her, she kept me calm throughout the fights my parents had, and also convinced me to be alive. Then, I moved to a dormitory far from my town, and actually made friends. Fast forward and it's December 2019, I was sort of happy. I then called one of my friends, who knew I had psychosis. We talked about the demon I'm with, but then she doubted she was real. The only problem was that I could see her, and when that came up I realized something: ""Is she real? I tried a lot of different methods to contact her, nothing. I then realized that she isn't real. She was never there when I was down, crying or alone in my room. It was all in my head. I then got into Slipknot (Before all of this) and when the song Vermilion Pt. 2 came on, God I lost it. I went bonkers remembering all the times being with her, only realizing she is not real. I was trying to convince myself ""No, you'll find a soulmate, let the demon go"" and dammit, every thought of her haunts me. To this day, I miss her and realized that it was a coping thing due to being extremely alone and isolated."
