I can't stand black coffee, and I'm not crazy about it with milk and sugar but at least then I can drink it for practical purposes. But there are loads of things that taste awful without assign spices herbs or sugar. I absolutely love rhubarb, but no one can eat rhubarb without adding a lot of sugar to it.
