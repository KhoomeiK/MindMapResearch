socialanxiety,ffs0pf7,t1_ffs06zt,1580170304.0,It’s fine I’m really socially awkward to the point where I legit will not start conversations while the morning guard is a huuuge extrovert and he’s been there for 3 years while I just started about 4 months ago so they’re just not accustom to someone like me. Or at least that’s what I tell myself to get through it lol
socialanxiety,ffrybii,t3_euvubh,1580168680.0,People at my job don’t even say hi or bye to me anymore. I’m a security guard and I relieve the morning guard when I come in for the afternoon and everyone is like “BYEEE MORNING GUARD” then I wave or say hi and I just get stared at then when I leave and say bye I just get ignored
XXXTENTACION,ffpaxgl,t1_ffp78v9,1580090517.0,.... I don’t get it ?
XXXTENTACION,ffp4nat,t3_eueh8g,1580086133.0,Should’ve just added “to me” at the end
