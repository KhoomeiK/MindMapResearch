homeautomation,feyofp3,t1_feyed8a,1579448262.0,"Seconded. RGB White will never look quite right, it's worth having pure white only as an option.

And for price, Aliexpress is probably the cheapest option (though takes longer to ship). In my experience, more local companies (like Adafruit, whose Neopixel strips are fantastic, quality-wise) have much better quality control, but you'll pay for it. Just make sure you order more length than you need, because different batches of strip will have different colour balances, so if you need to swap out a section it will look the same."

Also there are also plenty of ways to ethically source meat from farms where animals are treated well, not all meat is factory farmed.

EngineeringPorn,fd2k5wg,t1_fd29c0f,1578148390.0," I work for a company that builds these models.

We built a model years ago (Philip House in NYC) for a building that was adding penthouses to the top floor, so they had us build a model of just the top of the building, with walls that slid down into the base so people could see the interior layouts.

EngineeringPorn,fd2haja,t1_fd123f4,1578147215.0,"1. There are companies that build only architectural models (I work for one), but a lot of architectural firms do their own models in-house. Our company mostly builds models for condo sales centres, but we've done work for a few movies (Pompeii & Crimson Peak are the two movies I've built models for), and TV studios borrow old models for set dressing every once in a while (we sometimes get old models back after sales are done, because the client doesn't know what to do with them)
