BackYardChickens,ffa12du,t1_ff9v8yp,1579725742.0,"Our BarredRock pecked my daughter under the eye. That hen was fun to watch move around the back yard - she was the only one in the mixed flock to jump up and peck at the tall grass seed heads. It was adorable. 

All but one of my Flock were butchered by a red fox who found a way to jump up and over into the run. I feel bad about it, but was also motivated to outsmart that Fox in the future. He hasn’t gotten any of my new girls (knocks on wood) and I do have a rooster now."
