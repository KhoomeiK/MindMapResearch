Around the time the movie came out I distinctly remembered an ""alternative medicine"" type getting his bubble popped. He'd commented *somewhere*.. A movie review in a newspaper? A blog? Somewhere small with only half a dozen comments.. He was just straight up PERPLEXED at why Jude Law wasn't the hero of the film and why ""big pharma"" were the good guys.

You could see he'd been mainlining that narrative for so many years it just didn't compute that the ""little guy"" wasn't good.

You get a MTG card of your work, that's going to get attention. You add a depression based story to your artwork and it's not horrible? You'll get more attention.

I don't think it's necessarily a man vs woman thing. It's unearned vs earned from a largely male perspective (which makes it seem more of a man vs woman thing than it is).

I think if you had a very conventionally attractive man that was obviously the focus of the picture and the artwork was decidedly average/not good but it was getting a ton of upvotes, other men would complain (unless maybe it's a bit ""gay"" to notice another man is good looking and compliment him by inference?). 

It's the unearned or unfair advantage that ruffles feathers. Knowing that Reddit skews overly male (to the point it's a meme that to get on the front of r/art you paint a hot girl with shadows over her face etc) they are going to detect what they perceive as unearned advantage or manipulation a lot more clearly in a shot of a woman given it's far more likely to be upvoted based on attractiveness of the artist in the first place (given more men are voting) and they're a lot more used to that dynamic.

I mean. Don't you see the lack of any kind of unifying argument you have when you look at the MTG guy? I won't pick his appearance apart because there but for the grace of god go I, but no man looks at that and thinks ""Look at that sexy bitch, using his chest hair to attract upvotes from the minority of female and bear/otter-loving men""."

I mean I understand national spirit and being happy to be from a particular place and certainly being proud of traditions you take part in, even down to the food you currently eat as an active part of the culture. But I dunno. If Europeans arriving in Australia 200 years ago were all perfect saints and the best humans in all of recorded history, would I really get to be proud of that today commenting on Reddit while whacking off on Pornhub?"

Only bothers me because it doesn't seem like there should be a problem for a Christian to accept this fact. I accept it. Like, flip it around - I'm an atheist. That's probably 80% to do with growing up in a fairly irreligious country. If you said I'd believe in Allah if I was born in Pakistan I'd say ""Yeah, most likely"". What is there to be butthurt about? ""No, with an entirely different set of experiences I'd still be the exact same person with the exact same beliefs""? lol."

unpopularopinion,ff4bwmw,t1_ff49icn,1579559991.0,"The largest single % of dogs is cross breeds at around ~30% so we love out mongrel bitsi's (bit of this, bit of that). Most surprisingly is the most common cross breed is a kelpie staffy cross. I can't think of anything more likely to bite something. Kelpies are bred to nip the ankles of sheep etc.

Purebreds are a pretty big thing here though, pure ""blue"" staffys are highly prized. Look, I'm a bit out of toich being older than average for Reddit but I think the adoption thing is a bit more American.  But we also didn't have SO many puppies in pet shops as my visit to LA 15 years ago. I'm not saying we don't do it, my inlaws adopted their dog from a shelter, just I see more of it from Americans. That might just be hanging around Reddit which is mostly American though."

unpopularopinion,ff2rvke,t1_ff24fip,1579521402.0,"People seem to be referring to all bull terriers collectively. The American Pit Bull from OP is an entirely different class of animal to a staffy which also has an American and non American version. American Pit Bulls are BANNED in Australia but Staffordshire Bull Terriers are either the #1 or #2 most popular dog breed depending on the year. American staffys are more violent than non American staffys and it appears this non American Staffy in particular is the dog that is better with children.

*edit* I just looked it up, American Staffys are about 3 times more aggressive than non-American Staffys bases on incident rates in NSW and ownership rates. Amstaffs have the highest incident rate of all dogs and are 2.8% of the population, Staffys come second but they are the most popular breed at 9.5% of all dogs. German Shephards look more agressive. ~60% of the incidents of a staffy but so low in ownership its not listed (=<2%) so both German Shephards and Amstaffs are worse than staffys. Bear in mind these are incidents reported to council and arent just dogs biting people but agression towards other dogs and animals as well."

It is an inherent part of the criticism and will be as correct as a subjective opinion ever is. However, ""your house, your rules"". It doesn't bother me in the slightest if you rule it with an iron anti-porn fist. By being upfront you are more likely to find the partner that agrees with your values.

Your experience isn't a magical shield that let's you do or say anything you feel completely free from criticism.

I say this as someone who has their own issues and has some unreasonable attitudes to things. I know they're unreasonable for a number of reasons such as their deviation from the norm but mostly that they come from a place that is hard to reason with so I would never defend them in an empirical sense only that they make me feel better personally."
