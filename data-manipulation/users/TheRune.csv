MadeMeSmile,fenzvxy,t3_eq1wkw,1579293182.0,"Congratulations! What an amazing story! Im so happy for you. I was in a similar but very different situation. My wife went into a very excessive pre-emp that started with massive pains and a impossible heart rate (285/230). When we got to the hospital they prepared me to go home a lone. They where pretty sure my son was already dead and my wifes odds where slim (she had developed HELP and PRES syndrome and her body was shutting down) - as soon as her bp was low enough for a surgeon to cut her, she went in to the OR. When she was stable enough I was allowed in. I was mentally picturing having to go home to my empty home, and pack up the infantry and clean up after my wife. A lone from now on.

How ever, when they pulled out my son (C-section) he was crying. I was so relieved. His APGA was at 2, but at 8 after 5 min - he was close but made it. The pre-eclampsia had caused his heart to overgrow so he had to go to neo for a week till he could oxidize properly by him self. My wife was moved to intensive care at the Grand national hospital of denmark, she was in critical condition (and stayed that way for 5 days) - so I was preparing to be a solo parent to this amazing fighter.

They both made it, and he is 3 next week. I can't believe they pulled though, and with no permanent damage.



Why do l feel the situation is similar? I figure the feeling of having the best thing ever, to suddenly be a situation of 'if I ever get to take him/her home I'll be so thankful' which would, normally, be given. I had this fantasy of carrying the baby carrier over our door step. It was like the ultimate goal for me and I broke down when it happened. No one knows what will go through your head in such a situation till you are in it. Monday was a normal pregnancy where we where expecting a normal kid with a smooth birth. Next day I was being prepared by the doctors that I would most likely lose everything. A week'ish later, we where home.

I'm lucky that my son was 'out of danger' when he was born, where your risk started at birth with surgery. I'm thankful l could enjoy my little guy once he was out, and not have to worry about him. I'm so happy you got to take your amazing kid home and get to live an amazing life. God speed."
