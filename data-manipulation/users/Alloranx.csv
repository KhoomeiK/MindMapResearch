fatlogic,ff62x5s,t1_ff5xgph,1579617788.0,"Not OP, but can speak to the ""why was it banned question.""  Mainly because the drug has what's known as a ""narrow therapeutic range"".  In other words, the difference in dosage amount between what will be effective in causing you to burn fat, and what will straight up kill you from hyperthermia, is fairly small.  Everyone's tolerance for it is different, which means you have to slowly increase the dosage to the effective level, and even under medical supervision in the years before it was banned, there were lots of ""accidents"".  In addition, even at ""safe"" dosing ranges, DNP also sometimes causes people to rapidly develop eye cataracts, or their bone marrow to stop producing neutrophils (called agranulocytosis, spoiler alert: results in fatal infections)."

Nothing about fishing is ""time respecting.""  Fewer people have the Grandmaster Caster title than Ultimate titles.  It's not supposed to be anything but a test of your patience and resistance to disappointment.  RNGesus is a just god, though.  No one with a completed fishing log has avoided suffering, I assure you.  All of us have had our ""white whales."""
Eloping,fcm3p25,t1_fcl759o,1577763422.0,"> My parents (who were upset about us eloping) even said they didn't truly get to enjoy their own wedding day because of the obligations involved. They forgot to eat, they were busy entertaining guests, etc. So I'm like ok, now do you get why I don't want that?!

We may in fact be distant relatives, lol.  My folks said essentially the same thing.   They were still deeply offended by our plans.  /shrug

I had similar concerns too about what my parents (and hers) would think of our decidedly non-religious vows (yet to be written, but sure to be God-free).  It'll be way better with just the two of us, I am 100% sure.  We hired an expensive photographer so they can at least enjoy the beautiful place where we'll get married, and be able to experience it vicariously without having to digest what is actually said.

Anyway, I wish you the best of luck in getting the word out to your family.  I'm sure that it will turn out alright, regardless :)"
Eloping,fckx1rj,t3_eho8gw,1577735030.0,"I feel for you.  My fiancee and I are in a very similar position with our reasons for wanting to elope.  Her family is sort of ""in the habit"" of eloping (her brother, grandparents, several aunts and uncles all eloped) so they aren't too miffed about it, but my family is extremely religious and all of them got married in a traditional church ceremony.  I felt like telling my parents/sister and grandparents in advance to give them time to ""cope"" would be better than springing it on them after the fact.

So, over Thanksgiving, I told my parents and sister, separately.  My sister was very supportive, but my parents freaked out about it pretty severely.  Lots of guff about not having a church ceremony, and especially about them not being able to be present for it.  Some of which, I get, as no doubt they've been imagining how my wedding would be since I was very young, and this definitely isn't how they pictured it.  But, lots of disparaging words were said, to the point where I, like you, have questioned the wisdom of spending so much money and time and effort on a post-elopement reception for these people, many of whom I assume will be just as salty as my parents about ""not being invited to the wedding"".

Ultimately, I think we probably will have a reception for them, and will just put up with whatever passive-aggressive nonsense occurs there.  It's important to us both to have our families meet each other.  I do plan to have another hard conversation with my grandparents about the elopement in the next few days.  And I suspect that will suffice to get the word out to most of my other family (they are primo gossipers).  But yeah, we plan to send out announcement cards to spread the words about the reception to the rest of the family with whom I don't want to spend the time digging into the details of our explanation for the elopement.

At the end of the day, I'm very excited for our elopement in a few months, and the reactions of my family, while hurtful, haven't changed that.  I plan to enjoy the hell out of it.  And whether they want to celebrate with us or not is up to them."

pathology,fc65ir2,t1_fc62k5b,1577472746.0,"I'd also mention that the normal ranges for some lab tests change as kids age.  It's difficult to have sufficient granularity of validated reference ranges to account perfectly for these aging changes.  I don't know off the top of my head if the 3 tests that are mildly abnormal in the results you posted are ones that change significantly with age, but just consider that these may not even be *truly* abnormal.  

Just more reason to not worry too much, and let your doctor interpret them."
