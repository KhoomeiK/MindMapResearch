YangForPresidentHQ,fekhups,t3_epn7ya,1579200360.0,"Here are some arguments I've heard. You can run with them and verify them, but know that I'm just parroting.   
  
I think I see two clear concerns:  
1) Some people need more help, more than $1000/mo    
For some, 1000/mo is not enough, but it is still a big step in the right direction. Where 1000/mo doesn't help them, such as in health coverage, there are other policies better suited. The 1000/mo helps people in ways that they aren't already being assisted. It is very flexible. Where current benefits might leave out car repairs, new clothes, equipment for work, and other life expenses that the government isn't strong on, the UBI is here to help. For other concerns, they are addressed by other policies.  
  
2) FD (UBI) could leave people in a worse situation.  
FD is opt-in, which means if you currently receive more than 1000/mo in welfare, you can decide to keep those benefits. You take the better of the two, not the worst. In addition, FD Does stack with many benefits, not all welfare benefits have to be sacrificed to receive UBI, you can find details on this list, which is likely to evolve as implementation comes closer and impacts are studied. Furthermore, it's not a binary decision. If you receive 500 dollars in welfare, you can still accept 500 dollars of FD. It is striving to be fluid in this regard.  
  
Hope that gives you enough to begin your research of these policies on https://www.yang2020.com/ and other sources."

YangForPresidentHQ,fehd44c,t3_ep5fra,1579114086.0,"Unfortunately abortion related policies are very polarizing, and talking about them at all is going to cost supporters. The moment he was asked about abortion he was already in damage control no matter what his beliefs are, this is the case for anyone.   
  
I think in this situation his motivation for making changes to part of the government is not precipitating from an abortion policy. I believe he was trying to steer the conversation to another policy point as quickly as he could. The link he made unfortunately paints this very controversial topic with a focus that I don't believe he truly has. He is running on economy and technology policies first and foremost, and reproductive rights isn't a hill I imagine he would want to die on. I'd wager that it could be one of his bottom priorities.

You start by rubbing it under your arm or onto other sensitives parts of your skin. Think armpit, wrist, or other soft parts.   
After waiting some time you move on to more sensitives areas around your face, such as your lips. The risk at this stage is hives and swelling and itchy reactions. You don't want to make your airways swell.   
  
After that test, you move on to a simple taste test, do not consume! The next step is to chew it, and the finally you eat a small sample. As the steps progress so does the waiting period after the test. It's time consuming and should take pretty much all day (not that you can't multitask).   
  
If at any point during the test you get any kind of reaction, stop the test and mark that as inedible. Another thing to note is that cooking (boiling) raw foods is a good way to make them safe(r).
