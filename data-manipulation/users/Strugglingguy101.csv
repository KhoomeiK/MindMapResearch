BreakUps,fd3zzg6,t1_fd3w8zj,1578163122.0,This is great advice!
BreakUps,fd3vkt1,t3_ejzxjs,1578162007.0,"Your therapist is a moron. Telling you to reach out was bad advice. I was in a somewhat similar situation as you. You are only setting yourself up for a world full of hurt and you will ruin any progress you have made. You cant get closure from someone else my friend, and especially not from some stranger who you dont know anymore. she is not the same person you knew. You have to try and find the closure you are looking for with  yourself."
BreakUps,fd3utb3,t3_ek037d,1578161798.0,"Do not reply. I've been where you are now, and it ruined all of my progress when I did. It lead me down a rabbit hole that I'm still struggling to climb out of."
BreakUps,fcsbley,t1_fcgixxa,1577914262.0,I've been single for for the last half decade. Dating here and there but I've never committed to anyone again. And being alone doesn't get easier after time. At least not for me. I hope it does for you though
BreakUps,fcsb3j4,t1_fcs456n,1577914057.0,You're right. I would not be the person I am today if we hadn't broken up. Doesn't make it hurt any less though.
BreakUps,fcgh2uo,t3_eh6pj3,1577639934.0,"I had this same realization. I miss being in a relationship, but I dont have it in me to go through all the hurt again, and it seems inevitable that you will get hurt in a relationship. Just about everyone I know are either in a miserable relationship/marriage and are unhappy, or they have been absolutely destroyed by a significant other after a breakup. I only know a handful of legitimately happy couples, and they are few and far between.  There is a chance that you can find that kind of love and relationship, but there is no guarantee. You are guaranteed to get hurt though."
SuicideWatch,fcgetvu,t3_eh59rn,1577639270.0,I feel you man. But there is not much others can do to help you besides listen and give advice. Most people are too busy with their own lives to go further then that. I hope you feel better in the near future.
depression,fcfs445,t1_fcfd6td,1577633244.0,"Well, you are already ahead of the game then. I'm not sure what to tell you because I'm in a similar situation as you. Doing well in school, eating right, exercising, good friends. My problem is I obsess over the past, about things I cant change and have no control over, and it gets me in a cycle of negative thoughts and feelings. Are you dwelling on anything that makes you feel down?"
depression,fcfr1bm,t3_eh6m7q,1577632879.0,"I haven't been able to get through it tbh. But some people I know have. Saying this is like beating a dead horse, but exercise is a big thing for me. It gets me out of the house, keeps me healthy, forced me to socialize somewhat, releases stress, and makes you feel like you a progressing. It's really hard to get and stay motivated though. Good luck."
depression,fcfg65c,t3_eh5xlx,1577629657.0,"I know how you feel...

There are things you can do to help. It's not a definite fix, but exercise is a great way to feel better about yourself, like you are making progress, and also for meeting new people. It's really hard to get and stay motivated, but it really does help. I've been very depressed, isolating myself aswell, and honestly, if I didn't go to the gym to get out I probably would be dead by now. 

If your job makes you unhappy, you need to find something else. That's easier said then done, but it is a must. Working somewhere you dont like for an extended period of time will suck the soul right out of you. 

Hope you feel better soon."
depression,fcfe6c9,t3_eh61fl,1577629035.0,"This is something that is going to be tough to overcome, but in order for your doctor to help you they need to know what's going on with you. If you have a friend or family member who knows what you are going through and are comfortable having them join you, maybe you could bring them to your appointment for support. I was in this boat for a while aswell, eventually I just said fuck it and told my doctor everything. She was very kind and understanding. You dont need to tell him everything right away either. Maybe write down a list of the things that are troubling you and bring that with you as well."
depression,fcfcetu,t3_eh61et,1577628603.0,"Yes. Most people can get past this with therapy, exercise, healthy eating, socializing, proper sleep, etc. Its not easy to get motivated, but you have to start somewhere. Staying in bed and isolating yourself will only make it worse, in my experience. Most people I know who try to better themselves end up getting through it. Best of luck."
depression,fcfbd3v,t3_eh60gf,1577628352.0,"You need to go no contact with her. Dont drag it out. The longer you take to remove her from your life, the more painfull it's going to be. She isn't doing anything wrong here, you are. I dont mean that to sound harsh, you cant help how you feel, but knowing that she is causing you depression and anxiety but keeping her in your life anyway is entirely on you. Hope you feel better soon brother."
depression,faf3r8s,t1_faf2fqs,1576013908.0,I'm sorry I got so offended. I'm just not in a good place mentally.
