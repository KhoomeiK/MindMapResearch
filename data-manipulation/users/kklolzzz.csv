It is at a minimum educational to see what goes on outside of my safe bubble of reality, and to witness the barbarism and evil of man. It's at least a bit comforting to know that this type of thing is much less common than it was in the past.

Overall I think the stuff like car accidents and  random deaths like a bridge collapse are the ones that bother me the most as they are the most likely to happen to the average person.
