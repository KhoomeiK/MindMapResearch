CasualConversation,fed7ocj,t1_fed7hxt,1579002691.0,Thanks! I’m stoked :)
CasualConversation,fed7me2,t1_fed7jgi,1579002624.0,I’m glad to hear you guys enjoyed the experience! Makes me feel a little more sure about it :)
CasualConversation,fed6p9w,t3_eoht1r,1579001488.0,"Yep, I teach middle school English and I had some 8th graders last year reading at 3rd and 4th grade levels. This year I teach 7th grade and have a few students at 4th grade level still. These are native English speakers with no identified learning disabilities. Sometimes when there is so much stress in their life (trauma, etc) or little to no value placed on education due to lack of expectations (my mom dropped out of high school and we do alright, what’s my motivation to learn?) there is no motivation to learn.
Similarly, they may have fallen out of the habit of reading early on in elementary school and feel like they’re “too far behind” to catch up. They may feel it’s better to deal with their current ability level than to deal with the “shame” of having to work hard to improve their reading ability."
CasualConversation,fed6dwn,t3_eoio0y,1579001082.0,"Speaking as a young teacher... it will be hard, it will be difficult, and it will be extremely stressful and disheartening at times. That being said, it is so worth it. Coming home after knowing you made a difference for a kid is one of the most fulfilling feelings you can have. It’s the kind of work that makes your soul feel peaceful. If you’re unsure about staying in one country forever, consider looking into teaching in international schools in japan. I’ve known many people who have taught in international schools and then come back to the US to work without much fuss. Best of luck to you!"
CasualConversation,fed682s,t3_eoj8ch,1579000868.0,Awesome! Feeling productive and just enjoying time are some of the best feelings.
CasualConversation,fed64xe,t3_eojrja,1579000751.0,That must be so nice to have that completed with. Congratulations!
bulletjournal,feczqlh,t3_eogvo7,1578991496.0,Simple and gorgeous. Love the habit tracker and the monthly calendar on the side!
bulletjournal,fdcv9ll,t3_ekmdef,1578285301.0,Looks gorgeous! I’m starting intermittent fasting too. I added a collection to my journal with “go to recipes” so that I’m not always scavenging for something to eat for dinner.
bulletjournal,fdcv10k,t3_eknw1q,1578285106.0,I love the sitting on the butterflies. Super cute!
bulletjournal,fdcuv02,t3_ekjkkc,1578284971.0,Looks super cute and very functional!
bulletjournal,fdcurp2,t3_ekmr36,1578284896.0,This is so beautiful!
bulletjournal,fdcuo16,t3_ekoqwf,1578284814.0,"I’ve been looking to try bullet journaling for several months and the new year felt like a good time to start! This is my first monthly spread that I compiled from lots of ideas from others. February’s spread might be totally different depending on how this one works out!

Next order of business... buy better pens and markers..."
bulletjournal,fd30eix,t3_ejxg9x,1578153540.0,Looks gorgeous!!
CasualConversation,fc2fw8p,t3_eftrxr,1577357914.0,Not really what I got for myself but I got my fiancé a really nice camera so he can start shooting his own YouTube videos. I subtly found out that he knew what it was for most of this month but once I told him about all the features he was so excited.
