My parents said whatever I didn’t use for undergrad will be used for a grad degree. However, if I pursue a doctorate (clinical not research) like I want, any expenses will come out of my pocket. But I’m determined to have that covered by an institution or work somewhere with tuition reimbursement which is common for nursing."

Nanny,feohkof,t3_eq4epu,1579300288.0,"I actually have a temp nanny job now and it works well since I’m hoping to go back to school at the end of my 6 month contract. I also work odd hours since both parents are full-time professionals (with one parent working out of state) and I sometimes need to stay later. I’m paid within your proposed range, which is good for the DMV area. I agree with others that starting at $22/hour will attract quality applicants due to cost of living.

Communication is key of course. However, you seem like a reasonable and fair MB so you could definitely make it work!"

college,fe4zyfu,t3_cwufdh,1578864378.0,"This is my first time filling out FAFSA (for a second Bachelors degree) and I struggle with tax documents.

In 2018, I received a 1098-T form for a scholarship I received from my university. The only box with information in it is Box 5, which has ""$32,545.00"". The other boxes on that form are blank or $0.00. 

I'm not sure what to put down for the following question on FAFSA: 

>Student college grant and scholarship aid reported to the IRS in your income. Includes AmeriCorps benefits (awards, living allowances, and interest accrual payments), as well as grant and scholarship portions of fellowships and assistantships.

Do I need to report the full $32,545.00? Even though I received a 1098-T, does that count as reported scholarship to the IRS? I don't think the scholarship was included in my income for 2018 (but I could be wrong). I'm sorry if this is a stupid question or confusing. I can provide more information as well."

Flute,fdxw3wu,t3_enafil,1578773473.0,"I can’t tell you how many auditions I butchered. It really does suck and I understand how disappointing it can be.

Take a little break and when you come back, identify what’s specifically went wrong (besides the accident of the head joint).

Dry mouth? Fingering? Sight-reading? And then make a game plan to address those over time.

What helped me to combat nerves is playing when no one else is. I would arrive early to band since it was my first period and just started practicing while people came in and dropped instruments off. Feeling so exposed allowed me to practice playing in front of others.

Another tip: envisioning a good audition, warming up and not practicing too much the day of, playing one of your favorite up-beat song before auditioning (bring headphones)"
CasualConversation,fdxobox,t3_en8jsm,1578771211.0,"I’ve been through all the Dateline podcasts episodes and there are some absolutely bizarre and interesting cases. 

My personal favorites and descriptions from the Apple Podcast app:

* **She Never Left** - “A missing mother in Jacksonville, Florida leaves behind a three-year-old son, whose memory of their last night together offers some clues as to what happened to her. The case remains cold until two decades later when the son, Aaron Fraser, solves the mystery that haunted his childhood. For the first time on network television, Aaron speaks out...”

* **Reckless** - “Lead detectives and family members speak to Dateline about the case of teenager Michelle Carter, who was convicted of bullying her boyfriend to kill himself...”

* **The Overlook** - “Two young women are shot and left for dead on a beach in Texas. After one miraculously survives, she is determined to find out who the attacker is. When a young man is eventually convicted, the long road to justice seems to be complete until a stunning twist raises a question - could the wrong man be in prison?...”

* **A Deal With the Devil** - “In this Dateline classic, Keith Morrison reports on a notorious serial killer, nicknamed Hannibal, who murdered several people while working as a confidential informant for the FBI...”

* **A Villinous Plan** - “A Connecticut bank executive is targeted by a crew of criminals who invade his home, take him and his mother hostage and order him to rob his own bank. If he doesn’t commit the crime, they threaten to blow him up with a bomb strapped to his waist. Investigators think it looks like an inside job but after a string of similar crimes in Tennessee, they learn the victims were picked based on social media posts...”

* **Unraveled** - getting too lazy to copy descriptions 

* **Death Trap**

* **The Match**

* **Deep in the Woods**

* **The Prussian Blue Mystery** - if you’re interested in toxicology, this is a great one 

* **The Thing About Pam** - has it’s own podcast

* **The Pink Skirt Plot**

* **Deliberate Evil** - this one is wild"

RBNLifeSkills,fdgo028,t3_el3rvn,1578403610.0,"I just came out of a toxic work environment.

The very first day, the office manager pulled me aside and told me that the doctor who owned the practice would get into moods easily and that I “shouldn’t take it personally”. That same day, I watched as a patient stormed out of the office because he was so condescending towards her.

Be vigilant the first week and be wary of people’s attitudes. If it seems off or odd, it’s only going to get worse"

AskWomen,fd43hf8,t1_fd0wwgb,1578164052.0,"You can get a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), but not all universities/colleges have it. Schools that do have it have a dedicated Nursing or Professional Heath school. 

If a school doesn’t have a BSN, then there is usually a pre-nursing track. Your degree won’t be in “pre-nursing” - basically you can major in anything as long as you take the courses specified in the pre-nursing track. Pre-nursing can help you get into accelerated or second-degree BSN programs or into entry-level Master programs (MSN or Clinical Nursing Leadership (CNL) programs). 

My university didn’t have a BSN, so anyone interested in nursing would do the courses necessary as part of the pre-nursing track and then would get clinical hours when they could. They then applied for entry-level Masters and/or Doctorate programs in Nursing. 

I was pre-med/pre-health in college and I’m now applying to accelerated BSN programs. After working with a BSN, I then plan to apply to a Doctorate of Nursing (DNP) program to eventually work as a Nurse Practitioner."
AskReddit,fd240ft,t1_fd071o5,1578141333.0,"I just left a toxic workplace where I put in a lot of extra work to help the office still function. I would come early, juggle my responsibilities and try to help my co-workers whenever possible, and took on extra responsibilities without complaint (or a pay raise). I was always complimented for my skills, etc.

When I gave my 2 week notice, it was like a switch flipped. Barely anyone would talk to me, lots of passive aggressiveness (my supervisor refused to say ‘bless you’ anytime I sneezed for those 2 weeks). Any time past employees would leave, they would get a nice catered lunch with flowers and balloons. I got nothing - not even a generic card. 

However, before I left, I had to train 2 of my co-workers how to do some of my most complicated jobs. I’ve already heard that neither one of them can do those tasks properly, which will cause problems later. Plus, my other co-worker, who I was friends, with is also planning to leave. It’s a small office and they haven’t even found someone to replace me yet lol. 

There’s so many things wrong with that office and I’m hearing how they are finally starting to crack. That place deserves to shut down."
