I was mocking the content of your comment, not the structure of it.  Your whole comment reeks of someone who thinks about girls rather than interacts with them.  Like, how many hours of porn roughly do you think you watched to form all those opinions on butts and boobs, and is your search history something like

""Cute butts""

""cute boobs""

""Big gross butts with cute boobs""

""Big ol cute butts""

""big titty sex""

""big butts sitting on cute boobs""
