If I met someone, fucked them and went on my way I don’t see how would it even be possible to feel something other than attraction and that’s not really relevant because I have it for a lot of people."

tumblr,ff8t041,t1_ff8sl6j,1579694957.0,"It’s not about men being incapable simply because they’re men. The point is that the brothers are the types of persons who most likely wouldn’t engage in a fight unrelated to gender, while the sister is someone who would, also unrelated to gender. It’s challenging the boy protects girl and boy likes to fight, girl can only scream stereotypes. I wouldn’t say it does so in an especially good way but that’s the point of it."
unpopularopinion,ff5ztxl,t3_eroexl,1579615435.0,"I agree with some of your points - definitely not the one where you dismiss other people’s hardships. You can’t really say something’s a non-problem if you got nothing to do with it. I mean, you can, but that’s not a relevant perspective. 

I do agree that calling a whole race racist is racist, and here’s why: there’s a bunch of countries - maybe small and not very powerful, but still existent - that are populated with white people whose ancestors had nothing to do with the racism that happened in other countries or by their doing, yet they still get judged. 

My ancestry is mostly from European countries that had absolutely nothing to do with slavery or segregation or in any way harming another race, but I’m still always put in the same box with the people who descended from the perpetrators. 

Not saying that someone should be blamed simply for being a descendant, but it’s reasonable to expect them to take a stance about an issue in their country that their ancestors contributed to. It’s not reasonable to expect me to be apologetic when not only my nation did nothing, it also suffered from the same or similar groups that people or color did. We were also seen as ‘lower’ in many parts of Europe and we still are, and we’re barely seen as white by those groups, if at all. But we’re apparently white enough to be judged in the race centric society. 

Me being dominantly white doesn’t say enough about my heritage or opinions - nowhere near enough to be judged at a first glance. In USA, and some other countries, the basic division is just by race - in most of Europe, there’s much more to add. But if you find yourself in USA, it barely counts. I have to give a whole presentation to explain my lands of origin as they are. My self identity and beliefs aren’t based on the simple grounds of being white - I have a whole culture and national identity to add to that which does not in any way include all the negatives attributed to whites in the western world today."

unpopularopinion,ff5ytoa,t1_ff5vn1q,1579614617.0,"I’m a girl, but let me say I was pretty much what you’d expect from a boy in terms of what you’re talking about (like many other girls but that’s not the point), and I haven’t thought of that. I’ve thought about a lot of other things in that manner, but not that. I think we should keep in mind it’s a deathly hallow gifted by Dumbledore, previously owned not only by Harry’s deceased father but generations of their family, so even looking from a teenage boy’s perspective, it makes sense to respect it at least enough not to use it for perving around Hogwarts, especially considering the situation Harry lived in. Most people aren’t one dimensional horn blobs even as teenagers though they might seem to be in certain situations. The focus of the teenage life shifts to exclusively boobies only if you got no other problems to deal with and he was kinda dealing with a lot."

tumblr,fdkklxa,t1_fdkkfn8,1578505545.0,Well I think it generally is. I’m against actual disrespect being normalized but I’m definitely against arbitrary rules being imposed on people and punishing children for perceived slights.
tumblr,fdkjydx,t1_fdkdehd,1578505221.0,"Cultural and depends on the period it’s happening in, I guess. Relationships in general aren’t as formal as they used to be and with time the change is  probably going to happen everywhere unless there’s a sudden trend shift. 

It’s a shame it does but hopefully it happens less with time as well."

depression,fdcab8e,t1_fd9ms92,1578270237.0,"Eh, while that’s all technically true, it’s safe to say that in most modern societies  (and probably even more so in the not so modern ones) it’s a thing not to fuck your friends’ exes. It’s more reasonable to expect a person that’s against those rules to speak up on time, rather than the ones who adhere to them, because they’re pretty much the norm, as you can see by it even being a popular ‘code’ and the responses here.

Like it’s totally fine to have an open marriage if both parties agree, but the one who wants to start the open part of it would be expected to say so, not the monogamous one to say they want it to be monogamous because it’s the norm that it is. If you just open it without a discussion, that’s basically cheating, even if in your mind it’s normal to be in an open marriage - most people don’t feel that way."
depression,fd9jw8e,t1_fd76tb7,1578234394.0,"It’s not about ownership of the other person, it’s being a friend which means not participating in hurting your friend’s feelings. 

Exes will go on to fuck other people, it’s probably going to hurt and that has to be accepted, but friends don’t need to participate in the whole ordeal. 


It’s not about choosing between one person’s feeling of loss or another’s of attraction in a vacuum of objectivity and with disconnection from all the subtleties of interpersonal relationships or the relationships themselves, it’s actually weighing if fucking someone you’re attracted to is worth hurting a friend to you.  

To some people it is, to some not, but that’s the choice being made, not a philosophical decision on what and whose feeling would take precedence. It’s a subjective thing - how much is this worth to me? ‘Hurting a friend’ as a price gets a place on the scale and for people who appreciate and respect their friends, it’s often going to be too high of a price for sex with a hottie."
unpopularopinion,fchobj5,t3_eh5l56,1577652373.0,"Can we boycott other things from the past if we feel they’re not okay now? I’d say that’s not only something we should be able to do - it’s in some cases vital

This is like saying I can’t boycott a political ideology because if I lived in a particular country in a particular time I’d be all for it because it was alrighty over there back then.
Sure it was - lots of people didn’t know better.
It’s not alrighty now where I am. Because we know better. 

Yes, maybe the quality overall is good, but I have no reason to accept and pretend to enjoy something that is, actually, offensive for people living in civilized countries of today."
