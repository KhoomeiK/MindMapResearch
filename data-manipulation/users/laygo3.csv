There are some other books when you find those that are related: Eyes of the Eagle, Phantom Warriors, etc. My Dad has a chapter in book 2 & has a mention in book 1.

Gary Linderer, the author of several, was going to help my Dad get his book published, but my Dad passed away. I'm not sure of the status of the manuscript.

There's SOME stories on this website, but none are as interesting as the book. You can search around & find plenty of association websites related to LRRP/LRP/Rangers in VN. My Dad wrote an article on this site, but for privacy sake, I'm keeping names to myself.

Side note: when Battlefield Vietnam (the game) came out, I bought it on release day. I have always had an affinity for VN related stuff. Randomly, I was on the EA BF:V forum & someone asked the staff if they had permission to use the Shark mouth on the Huey depicted on the cover of the game. Turns out, the 174th  AHC (Assault Helicopter Company, aka Sharks (gunships)/Dolphins (slicks)) [got permission from the WWII Flying Tigers](http://www.174ahc.org/174ahc6.php) to use the nose art. Someone linked to the 174th website & I spent MONTHS reading every website I could with stories from VN units. In turn, I'd ask my Dad about things I read, but didn't understand. I have a lot of fond memories of those conversations with my Dad.

It comes down to investment. Learn the shortcuts, force yourself to use them.

I loved learning about Live Templates (type a short string & it auto expands into something much larger: type `pubf` & then hit tab, it becomes a full `public function () {}` block ready to start typing the function name, hit tab/enter & it's ready to start with params, tab/enter again & it's now in the body.

It helps to really want to use a LOT of keyboard shortcuts. Being able to navigate panes w/o grabbing your mouse as well. Start with CTRL + TAB, keep holding CTRL, you'll see a number/letter next to the panes. You can hit that number/letter (while still holding CTRL) & be taken to it. ALT + F12 to close that pane & back to the editor or ESC will leave the pane open & take you back to the editor.

Sure you can auto-run tests after a specific timeout of saving, but learn the shortcut to run it: CTRL + SHIFT+ F10. Debug the test with CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + F10.

Working with xdebug . . . I can't ever work without it. Makes your work correct so much more with being to step thru it. And being able to debug tests? Extremely helpful."
