I had been interested in going for an aluminum one like Roofnest's Falcon or the upcoming Odyssey tent from Freespirit, but it seems that the simple ones have all been designed without sufficient room to store bedding, which largely defeats the purpose in my eyes. To get enough room to close one with pillows inside, it seems you have to commit to $4k (or more) and bunch of luxury features (and weight) that don't strike me as necessary.

That being case, I keep coming back to the Sparrow Eye. I actually have 2 more questions, if you don't mind:

Do your feet feel cramped by the slope of the ceiling? I'm 6'1"" — do you foresee any clearance issues between my feet and the roof when lying on my back?

Do you have any tips or guidance about securing the contents of the tent? There are over 30,000 homeless people here in LA, and at least a few of them would love to have a thick mattress and warm bedding. Have you had to look into options for locking mechanisms?

I have a 5th gen with about 3 inches of suspension lift and 275/70r17 KO2s. After the lift, the truck looked pretty awkward with the factory-offset Trail wheels because they were so inset. To combat this, I added Spidertrax spacers, and that made it look natural.

Many people struggle with completing a single push-up when first starting off. If you find yourself to be at that common starting point, try dropping your knees to the floor and using them as the pivot point instead of your feet. Doing so will make things easier. If it's still too difficult or if your wrists are hurting, you can also start with your hands elevated using something stable like the edge of a couch so you're not having to get quite as horizontal. If you do use one of these modified push-up exercises, always try to do at least one from the standard push-up position (if you aren't experiencing pain). You'll see significant improvement fairly quickly, and it will feel incredibly rewarding when you nail your first standard push-up."

The claim is that the airbags are deployed when a computer (presumably buried somewhere deep in the vehicle) detects G forces beyond a certain threshold, which will happen in a collision regardless of bumper type. The truck's ability to absorb impact through crumpling may be compromised meaning that collisions may potentially be more violent due to the increased rigidity, but the airbags should supposedly still deploy as soon as the deceleration is extreme enough to warrant it.

That being said, many (most?) bumpers bolt directly to the chassis's bumper mounting holes, just like the stock bumper. I believe the crumple zones are situated behind that, surrounding the engine compartment. Assuming that's the case, they should still function as Toyota designed.

At least that's what I tell myself ;)

The part we haven't touched on yet is the risk of being launched into the air and/or rolling over. Many bumpers are angled in such a way that the front of the truck will be lifted over something like a boulder if the truck is driven into one so that the tires can make contact and the truck can drive up and over it.
