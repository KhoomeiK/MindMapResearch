college,ffj38lm,t3_etuh50,1579989265.0,I failed college my first time around miserably so when I went back 5 years later I needed a refresh course for my college algebra because I forgot how to do things. My professor straight up said if you don't remember how to do these from your previous math class then you should drop this class cause I'm not going over it. I dropped it.
dating_advice,ffj1uck,t1_ffj1ok6,1579988275.0,No it does. I know acting angry at her and assuming she's ghosting would just make the situation worse than it is. I just wanted to talk to her in person to see what's up. If she says she's not interested then by all means I'll back off.
dating_advice,ffj1hw9,t1_ffir02w,1579988023.0,Well I'm not angry. Confronting was probably the wrong word to use. I meant more so just be like hey if you're not interested anymore it's cool. More of just ask her.
dating_advice,ffj1ded,t1_ffipxd0,1579987934.0,"Well yeah I figured, I haven't texted her since."
dogs,ffhkrga,t1_ffhkmsd,1579939857.0,"Perhaps, I haven't heard anything but his hearings better than mine. It stormed pretty bad on Wednesday however in which he hid but he seemed normal on Thursday."
dogs,ffhke6h,t1_ffhjv8x,1579939321.0,"I gave him the recommended dose of Pepto in the mean time, maybe he just has an upset stomach. But yeah I'll take him to the vet first thing I can."
rockets,ffh6qoe,t1_ffh6la3,1579924662.0,We have a new captain now.

dating_advice,ffe3gs6,t1_ffdy120,1579835709.0,"The sooner you quit online dating the better. Takes some getting used to having to approach a random girl and talking to her but you'll be surprised how often you actually get dates from it. I kid you not but I actually get more girls saying yes rather than no, around 75% I'd say."
MurderedByWords,ffdrtmv,t1_ffcx9xw,1579827359.0,I remember when I was desperate for a job after moving I got an interview at big lots. They told me theyd pay me $9 and I'd get 20 hours a week. I was like alright I'll just get a 2nd job on top of that. They said well the shifts vary from 4am to 5pm so so we need you available 24/7. Noped out of that one fast. Like who the fuck is that job for?!
dating_advice,ffdq9lh,t1_ffdpv2n,1579826358.0,"Yup, deleted that shit and never looked back. Confidence has improved immensely. Online dating is only good for supermodels, otherwise it just lowers your confidence."
dating_advice,ffd189n,t3_esv912,1579811412.0,"From what I've learned you don't need to, you just need to work on your confidence. I used to only use online dating and figured since I didn't get any matches I needed to lower my standards. When I started gaining confidence and asking out girls I found attractive in person I almost always got a yes."

college,ff9emgo,t3_es78zw,1579711359.0,Same scenario sort of. I dropped out of school years ago and had like 2.5 gpa or something. Had to get 12 As to bring it up to a 3.0 so I could transfer to University. Well after this semester if I get all A's again I will finally have that 3.0.

seduction,fehweb1,t1_fehvzmp,1579125196.0,I mean they are but it's still worth a shot. If all I get is a study friend kind of vibe I won't pursue anything but 2 of the 3 seemed pretty interested and asked me about my personal life and even what I was doing later. The other one was kind of shy so no idea what to expect there tbh.

depression,fd5cxtj,t1_fd5cqnq,1578176393.0,Honestly from experience nothing will happen. No one ever wants to be honest no matter how much you ask them to be. They'd rather just be distant than to tell you the truth.
depression,fd5beu9,t1_fd5b3v7,1578175973.0,Yeah I've just given up. If she texts me cool. But we're definitely not as close as we were before and doubt we ever will be again so I'm trying to move on. I tried talking to her about it and she just gives me the usual don't feel like talking sorry. It's been 3 weeks... Really shows how much she cared about me.
depression,fd59kks,t1_fd4psvr,1578175422.0,That's literally what my current friend who's ghosting me said. I didn't want to cause I figured she'd judge me. She's like no I won't. As soon as I opened up she stopped talking to me. Fucking bitch.
