relationships,fckqyum,t3_ehnyjk,1577731290.0,"My husband not only went to law school, but was a divorce lawyer and we’re very happily married. Your position, while on the surface appears to be logic-based, lacks depth. Divorce rates scare you? Look them up for your demographic (college educated, over 25, first marriage). They’re heavily skewed by people who aren’t like you. They’re also going down. Alimony scares you? If your wife works throughout your marriage, it won’t come up. If your wife, by mutual decision, agrees to take a career hit to raise your children (look up daycare prices in your area for an idea of what that labor is worth) — shouldn’t she be financially compensated if you leave her ass down the line? 

Marriage isn’t necessary for everyone, but it is for some people. It comes with legal, financial, social, and emotional benefits. If you can’t think of ANY reasons to get married, you’re not thinking."
caninebehavior,fc49fgt,t3_efvoqj,1577410225.0,"It might be that, like the other person said, she is missing the other dogs – it can be beneficial to show the corpse to the other dogs in a household when one dies, for this reason. A possible alternative explanation is that she's bored, due to fewer dogs in the household and/or her health conditions limiting her mobility (and therefore her exercise). If the other dogs are buried locally, you could try taking her to their graves, she might be able to smell them and understand. To address boredom, try googling ""scent games"" – nosework would be perfect for a basset hound with limited mobility, since it's all about sniffing and is generally very low impact."
