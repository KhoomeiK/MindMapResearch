I go through cycles of sleeping till 10 for about a month, then like 2-3 weeks of waking up in the middle of the night multiple times and not being able to fall asleep. I think it was just because the week before that I couldn't sleep and also was constantly surrounded by people (that also exhausts me quite a lot). I was most likely just so tired after that that my mind just needed a break and couldn't really function properly because of that."
