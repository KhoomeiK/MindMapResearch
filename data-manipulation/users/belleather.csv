90s,fffxzc4,t3_etcosa,1579894252.0,Omg this is so great!! You need to arrange by genre and alphabetize them with the little dividers like blockbuster did!
findfashion,fffxp78,t1_fffg2z4,1579894078.0,It’s definitely a gamble but one I think is worth taking!! I’d say about 60% of my purchases have turned out great or better than expected. The other 40% are shitty quality and immediate returns....but def worth the price I pay for the good 60%!
MakeupLounge,ffedh7b,t3_esve7c,1579844003.0,I hereby forbid you to ever “keep it simple”.
CrossStitch,ffed600,t3_esyaa7,1579843710.0,Wow!! It’s gorgeous! I’m a beginner and this is great motivation for me to keep practicing. Great job!
sewing,ffarsa5,t3_esb9rq,1579742979.0,Omg!!!!! I absolute HAVE to attempt a version of this for my boxer!! I grew up with boxers and now have one of my own and I adore him beyond words. Thanks for the motivation! It’s beautiful!
deadmalls,ff7awzc,t1_ff78xyy,1579645013.0,"My first job was at Hollister in 2006 and I will never forget my first shift - I was handed a spray bottle full of what I thought was cleaner, but it was FULL OF COLOGNE. Like at least a quart. My task was to “spray everything”......the merch, the floors, the fake plants, the wood around the doorways.....If it got low we popped the seals on new bottles to dump in (apparently factored in to inventory??) I had a constant headache and quit after 11 days."
