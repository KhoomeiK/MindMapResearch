WTF,ffqghyf,t1_ffoao6q,1580133913.0,"The goal of the two sock system is to keep your feet as dry as possible and lower friction. Neither nylon nor cotton are great at absorbing moisture, but wool is great at it. If you only wear a cotton sock as the single layer, the inability to absorb moisture becomes a problem, since the shoe often absorbs the excess moisture the sock can't, which typically increases friction. However, in the double sock case the bad absorbtion ability is used  intentionally. The purpose of the inner sock is to let most of the moisture pass through it, so it gets absorbed by the thicker outer wool sock, keeping more moisture away from your feet and avoiding friction against the foot. The two sock layers slip against each other rather than between the inner layer and the foot. The point is not whether cotton is a great material for socks in general - it's not - but rather how the inner or outer layers interact with each other to keep your feet more dry and reduce rubbing directly on the skin. If I were using a single sock layer, wool would also be my  choice."

WTF,ffo0gec,t1_ffmtpei,1580072903.0,"I've honestly never heard anyone recommend using a single pair of socks for long marches before. I've always been told to avoid it. Wearing two pairs of socks, a thinner cotton (or women's nylon) inner pair and a thicker outer wool pair, has been common practice among experienced hikers for a long long time. Your boots should be somewhat bigger than your normal size, to accommodate the socks and avoid compression. I've used this both for hikes and for long military marches with full gear. We were even issued cotton and wool socks specifically for marching, meaning somebody had probably looked into the matter. Make sure you don't have any wrinkles on either pair of socks before putting on shoes. Wrinkles can lead to chafing and blisters. Bring extra pairs of socks and switch whenever you can to keep your feet as dry as possible. Hang your wet socks to dry on your backpack while marching. Weirdly enough, some also recommend marching with your fly open to ventilate properly and avoid sweat crystals forming in your groin area, especially over extended marches. Over time, that can lead to chafing of the worst kind, having your skin rubbed raw with salt, in areas you really don't want it."

I'm not at all blaming you for this, Mikey_dude, but when you say it should all be reported, that was just as true in 1920, 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020, or any other time for that matter. It's plainly obvious that it should have been reported! The question is why that didn't happen before? Why did people instead try to hide it? Why did so many people in the church, that were not the actual perpetrators, put in so much effort to make sure it wasn't reported? Why should anyone expect that the next case will be handled any differently now? What has changed?

That stuff like this happens is to some extent beyond the church's control. However, what the church can control is how it responds to such incidents. What they chose to do was pretend that it didn't happen, cover it up, protect the perpetrators, and even at times blame the victims. This is where the church really failed its victims. How the organization responded is not about individuals, it's about the organizational culture. People did what they felt was expected of them. That's where the real problem lies. Once established a culture is very hard to change. I sincerely hope that the church is trying to change this culture, but the ""it was all done by a individuals"" does not make me hopeful. It still reflects the same underlying culture of not dealing with the problem and trying to sweep it under the rug. There's a reason that people say ""Culture beats strategy"""

He's a high level manager type of guy who was sent to a developing market by his company. When he got there the local company asked him how many he needed in his domestic staff. Being an egalitarian guy, he felt super awkward about the whole thing and told them that he didn't really need anyone. He could take care of stuff himself. Some weeks go by and he spends most of his time working, but also does a bit of garden work and repaints something just to relax. 
  
I don't remember exactly how he found out, but it turned out that everyone at the office and his neighbors considered him a raging asshole. Here was this rich guy who was so miserly that he refused to provide a livelyhood for even a single one of the country's many poor families. He could easily afford to employ 3 or 4 people, but he was so stingy people had even seen him do their jobs himself rather than even hire someone temporarily. What a dick, right? 
  
This was definitely not how he saw the situation himself, but he realized that by trying to be a decent guy by his own standards, he had become an asshole by theirs. Once he figured that out, he quickly employed some domestic staff with the help of someone at the company. As the word spread the people he worked with also started becoming a lot friendlier and not just treating him professionally correct.

nextfuckinglevel,fedb2u5,t1_fecnvi5,1579006256.0,"While this is not necessarily the case for all of Asia, where many countries have very high literacy rates, advertisers in countries with lower literacy rates are often forces to work more creatively to enable people to find their product without being able to read the product name. They have to rely much more on other types of visual cues to build recognition, for example more distinctive colors, patterns, fonts, mascots, and highly recognizable ads, which often turns out more interesting than when they lazily can rely on just the product name. After seeing this film once we may not remember the name of the spray, but all of us would almost certainly recognize a picture of the insect guy on a store display and think, ""hey, there's that spray that the insects bring back to their nest so it wipes all of them out"".
