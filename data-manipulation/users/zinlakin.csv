Note that not a single link addresses a single one of those points.

Stop arguing against the strawman of climate change denial. I clearly believe it does exist. I stated it has never been stable which means it is always... thats right! Changing. Good job.

I simply believe that the mechanisms are not fully understood and I tire of the constant preaching from people using devices created from strip mined and toxic materials. Im not agaisnt nuclear energy or emissions reductions. I would also love to see the end of petroleum reliance if for no other reason than to make every country a more stable place politically. In fact part of my job is enforcing environmental protections.

>What is the angle for your argument? Just to be right and make certain people look stupid?

I take issue with the blind worship that climate science has turned into. It has caused people like you to follow blindly without wanting to understand the issue, all the while running around belittling anyone who dare ask questions.

>What if you're wrong? Worst case scenario from my point of view is every climate science organization is incorrect and in turn we have a cleaner world propelled into renewable, sustainable energy and technology.

Worst case scenario? You have huge swaths of land destroyed to make wind and solar farms while producing a fraction of the required energy using unreliable methods. Destroy more land mining the toxic materials required for your panels and batteries. Also, you lose support for the whole cause by disenfranchising people like me who are tired of the harping and higher energy prices that follow the implementation of wind/solar. Then you'd get no support for ideas that might actually work like nuclear or fusion. Seriously, go look at the numbers for California or Germany, then go look at France."

Thats your statement right? Since the dawn of civilization there have been peoples where women had rights where there were male slaves who got none.

You should also note civilizations who served under queens, fought, and died for them while the queen (a woman) enjoyed many more rights and privileges. 

As for men abandoning women, what does that have to do with me and the current state of things? Family courts clearly discriminate against men currently. It needs to stop. Its been over half a century since women have fully entered the workforce and got the means to support themselves. Women still advocate for preventing automatic 50/50 parenting standards and ending forever alimony.

""How will society operate if we lose our free labor force?! You cant free the slaves!""

It may surprise you to find out that roads are regularly designed for the average travel speed and not the actual posted speed.

For example, per IMSA guidance, the time given for yellow lights (time for a car to clear the intersection from a stop bar at speed) is based on the average traffic study speed, not the posted speed limit.

While Im not condoning do 100 in a 30, going 15 over is not some mortal sin in certain situations (interstate travel for instance) given that some roads move at an average of 10 over."

And to be honest, any non vertical structure that doesn't support vertical elements will only be tested at a 1 per 100 CY frequency. Also, ACI (worldwide concrete testing certification) guidance is to take samples from the middle 3rd of any mixing truck (in separate parts) due to inconsistency in the mix in the beginning and end of the load due to the way the mixer operates.

Thats your statement right? Since the dawn of civilization there have been peoples where women had rights where there were male slaves who got none. Turns out that people in power just prefer to keep others away from it. This isnt always based on sex. You should also note civilizations who served under queens, fought, and died for them while the queen (a woman) enjoyed many more rights and privileges. 

As for men abandoning women, what does that have to do with me and the current state of things? Family courts clearly discriminate against men currently. It needs to stop. Its been over half a century since women have fully entered the workforce and got the means to support themselves. Women still advocate for preventing automatic 50/50 parenting standards and ending forever alimony. Id also like to add that discrimination to ""solve societal problems"" isnt a reasonable justification. That line of thinking is detestable. ""How will society operate if we lose our free labor force?! You cant free the slaves!""

And again, you failed to touch on the fact that men are sentenced in criminal cases much, much more harshly than women for the same crimes. You got any more of them justifications for that?

Are/were women discriminated against? Sure. But discrimination isnt exclusive as you seem to imply. Turns out anyone can be discriminated against. Even men! And even men need their interests advocated. Weird right?"
