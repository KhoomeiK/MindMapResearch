We stayed in Salinas with a lovely Airbnb family and visited Point Pinos Lighthouse. The food, rent, gas, everything was so high priced that I was grateful to return to Texas after the end of the week."
aww,fgohxmn,t1_fgo2aph,1580970590.0,"Anywhere in the south. I grew up with horses, our 3000+ sq/ft house with 3+ acres, horses, and a barn only cost $250,000. 

We’d have been poor in northern states but enjoyed excess in less desirable southern states. I can’t imagine wasting thousands trying to live in a small apartment in NY when I could live on land for a steal like my parents did."
HumansBeingBros,ffkue7r,t1_ffkshmr,1580029071.0,"They dumped them, probably out of a car, and they froze on their own. Likely from huddling together for warmth.

I’ve had a few rescues that I’ve found dumped from cars. One I had to wrestle out from under a mesquite tree on the side of the road (tree with huge thorns). She had an eye leaking pus. The vet said she likely got the injury being thrown from a car, it was a puncture wound.

The eyeball didn’t have to be removed, but it healed smaller than the other and cloudy grey. She also makes strange snorting noises due to the puncture wound injuring her sinuses. She sounds like a piglet. Enyo’s happy here years later, as I didn’t know if she was adoptable so I kept her."

This assumes you like reading btw (I love reading but struggle with listening to audiobooks/podcasts)

On each episode I pulled up the Magnus Archives Wiki. The wiki has a summary for each episode that is suitably short if you want to go through that way. I wouldn’t recommend it but if you’re struggling it’s helpful.

The wiki also has a link to a transcript of each episode. I would pull up the transcript for the one I was listening to. I would listen to the parts where the characters were interacting, and then as soon as a “statement”/story began, I would pause the podcast and then speed-read the statement using the transcript. I read far faster than the podcast moves. This means each podcast’s audio that you actually listen to is only a few minutes long.

There’s usually a few minutes character interaction at both the beginning and end of a podcast. In the middle is a statement that is just as enjoyable read as listened to.

This differs when it gets close to season finales. That can be anywhere from 2-4 episodes away from the season ending. Those podcasts absolutely need to be listened to in their entirety, there’s usually no “statements” involved. Each season is 40 episodes.

Feel free to message me if you have more questions.
