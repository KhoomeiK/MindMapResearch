Good then you understand why I do not respect Christopher Tolkien.

He didn't like Jackson's films so he wouldn't license anything else.  He shut it all down, disallowing any other interpretations of the works of fiction.

Hate?  Of course not, that would be absurd.  ""I'm not mad, I'm disappointed."""

It was the flame retardant oxidizing that caused the yellowing.  It can be mitigated but not quite eliminated with newer retardants, so plastics that remain white are usually not protected with flame retardant."

It did take remarkable images, though.  That is still astounding resolution for that altitude and is impressive even today.

To keep the pictures clear the cameras required a special motorized mirror system.  The computer (or pilot) would input the speed of travel and the mirrors would rotate in the opposite direction to compensate and prevent the image from blurring."

I am not the guy to explain the formulas but online calculators are available.  The math is undeniable.  Input the camera specs and the distance and you can figure out the size of each pixel.

The camera was made by a company called ITEK and it was called the Technical Objective Camera (TEOC).  At 80,000 ft it had a pixel density of **2 pixels per foot.**  An entire license plate would be 2 pixels (so it would be impossible to read).

It's seriously as simple as `reg import C:\RegistryExport.reg`

It has other commands like `reg load` and `reg compare` that you could use for comparison and stuff, but you'll be writing all that conditional logic yourself.  Everything in the registry happens in ""force""/""overwrite"" mode.  So if you do not want that, your code has to be the thing that says ""don't set this value"" meaning you cannot just import the .reg file.  In that case you'd have to have a bunch of if/then statements, and call `reg add` for every single value, instead of just a single `reg import`"

Based on experience I think your car, house, and yard will make more of a difference than your neighborhood as far as how much you notice the wind.

Because I can't really say anywhere in particular is super windy or super not-windy, as far as I've noticed.

Generally speaking:

* Higher elevations are windier
* Dominant wind direction most of the time is somewhere between South and Southwest.  Therefore somewhere in the Northeast, just on the leeward side of a mountain, would be the most sheltered.  But I don't think the homes are really built close enough to the mountains for this to work."

There is a process for dealing with domain registrars and O365 and GSuite and every other vendor.  It's somewhat unique to each vendor with their own paperwork and evidentiary requirements to seize control of the account.  These processes are also slow.

OP provided a great amount of detail, obviously did research of their own, and then posted here to see if anyone had experience with this.

If, for example, you can just log into GSuite some other way and disable his account immediately, wouldn't you want to know that?  That's the sort of tip OP is looking for and it absolutely belongs in /r/sysadmin if you ask me.  Or something like, ""Don't use their online process, they'll never get back to you.  I called in and got control of our account on the phone in 5 minutes"".  That's the sort of thing that you sometimes get by posting here.

So what you're saying is not wrong, but it's also not really our part of the story.  THAT is the part of the story that the Owners/Chiefs/Attorneys can sort out.  But getting access to GSuite?

Person launching the strike can't do that.  THEY need to have all the evidence first.  But I have that luxury.
