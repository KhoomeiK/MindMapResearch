androiddev,fedltvi,t1_fedk5rl,1579014699.0,"Thank you for your answer. I was thinking about creating a database and using SQLite.  So I can normally use SQLite, install the application on my phone and the application will store it in the same way, i.e. save to the database, delete, edit it as during testing in the Android Studio environment? I still wanted to ask about the dynamic creation of categories and answers to my application, i.e. using ordinary database inserts?"
androiddev,fedji54,t1_fea9jou,1579013101.0,"Do you have any idea how I can add question and categories dynamically?  Can I just use a simple crud and just how can I later pull this data out for the quiz? I don't want questions, answers and categories written rigidly in the code, I want to modify data through applications."

node,fe267bz,t1_fe25uox,1578834918.0,"Thank you, the point is that the teacher insisted on using javascript in this application and this is to work without reloading the page. I was thinking about js node unless there is something easier if it come and backend js."

I need to create an application for bloggers within the university, but I'm worried about possible HTTP-related errors. Everything should take place without reloading the page, can you think ajax can be used normally?"

Polska,f878d8h,t1_f84j8s1,1574320257.0,Czyli generalnie znowu wracamy do punktu wyjścia. Chciałbym żeby wszyscy byli szczęśliwi czyli ci co mają więcej niech się coraz bardziej dzielą i rewolucja kulturowa. Masz przykłady państw gdzie bogactwo nie zostało wypracowane drogą socjalizmu.
