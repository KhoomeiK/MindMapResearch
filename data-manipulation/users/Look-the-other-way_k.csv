cavalierkingcharles,ff2ah8o,t3_er36bf,1579498690.0,My heart breaks for you.  I have a 3 year old tri that looks just like yours.  I had to give him a hug after seeing this.
cincinnati,ff1c807,t1_feks0b2,1579477414.0,"I gotta say, I don't agree with Delhi not being a good option.  I'm a transplant to Cincinnati and I've lived in Clifton (2 years), Oakley/Hyde Park (3 years), and now Delhi (3 years).  Delhi has the quickest and easiest commute for me and I work downtown.  I never run into commute issues except for the rare and occasional accident.  Also, my location gives me quick access to pretty much anywhere I need to get to in the city within 15 - 20 minutes (i.e., Hyde Park/Oakley, Newport, etc.) and I get to avoid the nightmare of 71 and 75. I'd HATE to live in Oakley/Hyde Park now. Traffic is a nightmare and it's way too expensive for what you get and the congestion of people is awful.  I also wasn't impressed with the ""attitude"" of the people in Oakley/Hyde Park.  Clifton is good if you're in college - that's about it."

dogs,feit5wj,t3_ep5jpm,1579146549.0,"For what it's worth, I've been in your shoes.  This description hits home for me.  My two cents - make the decision.  I waiting too long and it is one of my biggest regrets.  Be kind to her and show her compassion to go out with dignity.  It will hurt.  You will cry.  I went through this October 2019 and it still hits me at random times and I'll be fighting back tears.  Be there for her in the moment.  Pet her. Hold her. Maintain eye contact.  Do it before you fight to keep her around to the point where you wake up one day and see her lying immobile and in pain on the ground, but awake and conscious, with you rushing her to the vet in a panic and being an absolute wreck.  It haunts me to this day as I backed out of an appointment the weekend prior.  I would have done things differently if I could - hindsight is 20/20.  I knew when it was time. I let my fear and emotion get in the way.  I kept making excuses.  A good day or moment hit and I pushed it off.  Then the bad days and moments started to outweigh the good.  Don't let the minority good days/moments outweigh the bad days/moments.

YOU KNOW when it's time.  You posting this means YOU KNOW.  Trust your gut."
managers,feiodn3,t1_feijhwf,1579143244.0,"Thank you for taking the time to write a very thoughtful reply.  It helped a lot.  I got the news at the end of the day and I managed to work myself into overthinking it on my drive home and it turned negative. 

Apparently, it wasn't just my direct manager, but the management team, that said ""no question, those direct reports are going to LooktheOtherWay over colleague.""  I do believe it's because I'm stronger than my colleague (which played a part in me being somewhat jealous over who was assigned to my colleague because it will be easier, their more advanced, and will have more ""publicity"" - so to speak) and I expect my new direct reports will be happy about me over colleague as their manager."

dogs,fefwti1,t1_fedxszk,1579067793.0,"This was a huge concern for me.  I planned buying my house with my desire to have dogs.  I knew I wanted to be able to go home for lunch so it limited my options.

3 years in and I go home every day at lunch to let my dogs outside to play/potty, feed them, etc. 

I've never left my 2 dogs alone for more than 8 hours.  99% of the time, they are only alone for 4 hours at a time before there is human interaction for, at a minimum, 30 minutes to break up the day."
dogs,fefw9j2,t3_eomrod,1579067256.0,"This!


I had a co-worker that was so excited about getting a great dane someone was trying to rehome.  Everyone at work was so positive and excited about it - telling her what food to get, what to expect, etc.


I inserted myself into the conversation and started bringing up some hard truths.


* They were a family of 4 with 2 kids under 5.
* They were living in a 2 bedroom, 2nd floor apartment.
* The parents had a 2 hour round trip commute each day.  
*This dog would be alone for 10 hours minimum a day. (Cruel...)
* They had little kids!
* This was a big dog and would be there 1st dog EVER.


She didn't like my comments.  The lady gave them her dog.  Co-worker posted all over facebook about the new family member.


I went on vacation for a week.  I came back - no mention of the dog.  I found out co-worker was surprised at how much work the dog was, how destructive he was (being large in a 2 bedroom apartment by himself - in a new place!  - for 10 hours...), and was upset he kept knocking her kids over.  Duh. 


Found out - thankfully! - the original owner missed her dog so much she was happy to take him back as she was able to work out a deal to keep him with her landlord. (She was willing to pay a pricey monthly fee to keep the dog until her lease ran and she could move.)


Some people need to use their head and be realistic.  Dogs are a lot of work and require a lot of attention."
