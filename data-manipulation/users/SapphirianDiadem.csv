creepyencounters,ffa5a4f,t3_esblr0,1579728156.0,Wow. Your post shows you as an awful person. You don't know what's going on but call someone a serial killer? These comments are awful too. How can you with even 1% certainty decree the father a rapist when you all literally know nothing? Jesus. This is trashy
tifu,ff7udq8,t1_ff7u6q4,1579658589.0,"How do you know the devices are high cost? How do you know they didn't mean only snacks or such? They've said they can't afford Wi-Fi, and that most devices are handmedowns. We can't gauge the situation enough. It also isn't a competition. Just because somebody is poorer, doesn't mean that you can't be poor."

It's not normal. You're not going to convince me 99% of teens screw on their parent's beds 
Kid can fuck on her own wrecked bed, she threw a tantrum. Deserves to get kicked out, it sounds like she's been awful forever. She's heading for 19."
AmItheAsshole,ff25hi3,t1_ff25cl7,1579494358.0,"I have. I was left home alone a lot sometimes. But I never fucked somebody on my parent's bed
