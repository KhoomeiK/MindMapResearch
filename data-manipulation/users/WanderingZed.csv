I'm learning that I need to process/confront/explore/heal what my discomfort is about. I'd like to find a way to be comfortable around people that are displaying affection."

hsp,feat78i,t3_eoahrr,1578951998.0,"I really struggle with this too. I'm learning to give it space, to be kind to myself, to give myself permission to be angry and not make myself wrong for these types of feelings."
capricorns,fe66hct,t1_fe62ihi,1578882871.0,Well I'm still new to astrology but I'm slowly learning to see the intricacies of how the other planets play into our lives beyond just the sun. Seems good to share those compatibilities.
hsp,fe6227q,t1_fe6097p,1578880034.0,Well my guess is that we find whatever coping mechanism works in childhood and then stick to it. Different for everybody.
capricorns,fe61z5x,t3_enwssz,1578879980.0,"I think in order to get a good idea of compatibility, much depends on where your other planets are placed, I think especially moon, venus and mercury."

capricorns,fdyynad,t3_encg92,1578784863.0,"u/Novasex & u/DrankTheHemlock, there are a lot of planets currently passing through Capricorn and Capricorn tends to be a very restricting sign, especially with Saturn currently in Capricorn. So a lot of people are feeling tense and constrained at the moment, things are likely not flowing very easily for most people during this phase. Hence, all the blame towards Capricorn right now."

capricorns,fdolx4x,t3_emgoe0,1578607815.0,"I've certainly been feeling the tensions of this build up to the  Jan 12 conjunction. It's been rough and I've been dreading it as well. But an insight has come to me. I realized that while there is a lot being shaken up at the moment and it's bloody uncomfortable, it's ultimately a healing process designed to guide and help and support us to fulfill our life's purpose. If we approach it from the perspective that this conjunction is here to enlighten us, not hurt us, I think it will be much smoother.  Wishing you well fellow Cap!"
introvert,fdmjqhf,t3_em5g4r,1578552441.0,"I certainly relate. What comes up for me is exploring a deeper understanding of what ""connection"" means to me. Does connection mean safety? Does connection mean enjoyment? Does it mean an inner sense of calm, that everything is ""okay"" for the moment? Perhaps what I thought was connection was really just a sense of me feeling that I'm alright in the moment. Perhaps what I'm really wanting is to feel whole inside of myself and my strategy for doing that in the past was spending time with others.

Just reflections..."
interestingasfuck,fdlz5cu,t3_elzkz3,1578535973.0,"Anyone see the movie Colossus: The Forbin Project ([1970](https://www.imdb.com/year/1970/?ref_=tt_ov_inf))? A great movie very relevant to today about AI, the same thing happens in that film. [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064177/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064177/)"
socialanxiety,fdlyxd2,t3_elz98t,1578535819.0,"ugh, yes. that's why I typically avoid it. it's so lifeless and meaningless to me. I would rather be alone and contemplate the deeper mysteries of life than deal with it."

gaming,fdlq53s,t1_fdln0l2,1578529833.0,"You start out with very little, as you progress in the game, you learn blue prints for building items for bases, you can grow, gather, mine materials to build up these bases. The cool thing is that you can build your base almost anywhere on any planet you want to. Billions and billions of planets to choose from, some beautiful and stunning, others very harsh and rugged (but with good minerals to mine). By farming or gathering materials to get more money to then better ships that helps you carry more materials and upgrade your weapon and suit.

If you play connected to the internet, you can also visit other people's bases or play cooperatively, share materials, etc.
Unfortunately the 
game isn't always the best at explaining some details so I find that the reddit community for No Man Sky is very helpful. Also plenty of youtube tutorials helping you out with any questions you have."
gaming,fdlmubz,t3_em0xah,1578527602.0,"I really enjoyed it. Played around 100 hours on it. If you like exploring, sci-fi, base building, farming or survival games, you will likely enjoy it."

hsp,fdjbryi,t3_elkpz3,1578464533.0,"I struggle with something similar, borderline agoraphobia - it comes and goes for me. I don't have any conclusive answers. My process has been to take things very slow, to give myself permission to say ""no"" if things don't feel good, to keep listening very closely to my body and emotions, lots of self kindness and compassion, to keep processing any trauma from my past that I haven't worked through yet. 

Wishing you well with this challenging process."
capricorns,fdhoic2,t1_fdg6ies,1578426987.0,"Well my concepts of spirituality have changed and evolved over the years. At the moment, spirituality for me means a process of becoming conscious of who I am and the nature of reality. So I explore and investigate my beliefs, ideas, thoughts, feelings and sensations in the body, noticing their temporary nature, being with the discomfort that often arises, and becoming aware of the ""me"" that is always here, always conscious, despite all the coming and goings of that which is impertinent.

Perhaps that sounds a little too lofty, a more down to earth description is that it's a messy process of me falling down over and over and over again and not having a clue who I am or what the hell is going on, being angry and frustrated and lonely and heartbroken and afraid but somehow still going on, working through all of these difficult layers to find something that lasts, something that is ever present. 

A pleasure to chat with a fellow capricorn about such meaningful topics."
