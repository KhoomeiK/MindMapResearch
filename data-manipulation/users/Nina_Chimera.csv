Whatcouldgowrong,fffn987,t1_fffmop7,1579887612.0,"This is such a self centered and weirdly ignorant view of how things actually work in the real world. 

Also, she did have an idea of how to use it. She just didn’t know how to hold it because a lot of people really don’t give a shit about guns or how they’re held."
news,fffiv61,t1_ffff5xn,1579884912.0,"Yeah you don’t have to tell me. I dragged my cat on a 14 hour drive to talk to a specialist that thought they could help when nobody else in my area could. They did help, and we ate ramen for a month lol. We always joke about that because her special diet was so expensive that she ate better than us. That was like eight years ago and she’s going on 19 with great quality of life so it was worth it!

So I’m absolutely not in any way saying pet insurance isn’t worth it. I work in auto insurance so I’m pretty big on the whole insurance thing in general. Insurance is a scam might as well be my theme song with how much I hear it!

I’m just saying I know some people that don’t bother because they literally couldn’t scrape the money together on the spot. Reimbursement or not. I know this because I’m the sucker that ends up helping them out because I love their stupid cats too. :|

Maybe I should just start low key taking out insurance on other people’s cats once I get attached to them lmao."
facepalm,fff8i2b,t1_fff0p6r,1579878352.0,So we’re back to Australia again?
news,ffebkt5,t1_ffe0ura,1579842233.0,I don’t know why someone downvoted you. A simple google search shows that mountain lions did actually die from rat poisoning. It’s royally screwing over bobcats and other wildlife too.
news,ffeasvc,t1_ffdy30h,1579841538.0,I think movies have kind of skewed people’s view of poison. Tragic women take the poison and swoon prettily to their death. Or their mouth foams a little bit and they die. Media makes it all seem pretty short and painless.
news,ffeakn5,t1_ffdyezt,1579841339.0,But not glue traps. Those things are just nasty. What a terrible way to die.
news,ffeaiak,t1_ffe6n4h,1579841280.0,The main issue a lot of people have with pet insurance is that it tends to be a pay for it yourself and get reimbursed type of deal. At least it was last time I looked around. Lots of people don’t have a few grand lying around.
aww,ffe8bet,t1_ffbqu7a,1579839441.0,It took gratuitous amounts of chicken but we were able to buy his love back for now lol. He’s getting neutered tomorrow so I guess we’ll just have to rinse and repeat.
Wellthatsucks,ffe7v15,t1_ffe7pki,1579839072.0,I don’t actually have a dog so my cats don’t have anyone else to blame. Except each other... kinda hard to figure out who to be mad at then the dipshits all run away at the loud sound the bad one makes lol.
Wellthatsucks,ffe7n8w,t1_ffe7lv9,1579838898.0,That was the cat.
aww,ffe7ikf,t1_ffe00jv,1579838792.0,"[Here you go](https://i.imgur.com/WJ5u111.jpg)!

aww,ffao3e7,t1_ffaein7,1579740500.0,He tested as negative for FeLV and FIV so we are keeping him! He’s currently under the bed and having none of it right now. I’ll edit in a pic later if I remember. I don’t wanna do anything weird to him right now. He still hasn’t forgiven us for the vet lol.
Wellthatsucks,ffamn6k,t1_ffajylc,1579739517.0,"Usually stuff that happens to your car, especially if you’re not in it, is Comp. If not it would be Collision but I’d be looking towards comp first if I had that claim."
Wellthatsucks,ffaiypt,t1_ffaiuu8,1579736874.0,Not in the US. Comp over here is also called “other than collision” sometimes. Comp does cover fire though. It doesn’t cover wrapping your car around a tree or hitting another vehicle. My point was that Collision exists here for the stuff that comp doesn’t cover. I guess it has a different more expansive meaning in other countries.
WinStupidPrizes,ffa9xz8,t1_ff9quth,1579730759.0,Do you think so? I think it’s comforting to know that most of them couldn’t manage to handle a normal social situation let alone deal with being part of a mob or something that requires human contact.
WinStupidPrizes,ffa9pyo,t1_ff9zml9,1579730631.0,I guess to that I would just say maybe don’t try to car jack the elderly around a bunch of (according to you) racist people? Pretty simple stuff.
WinStupidPrizes,ffa9jp8,t1_ffa5sz5,1579730531.0,Imagine helping some elderly guy that’s getting carjacked and some asshole mob kicks the shit out of you lol.
WinStupidPrizes,ffa95e0,t1_ff9k1mg,1579730306.0, Don’t worry too much. The cat will find a way to punish him if he forgot to feed it.
WinStupidPrizes,ffa8zz5,t1_ff93ijy,1579730223.0,Lucky for that old guy that someone acted and kicked people out of bystander mode and into mob mode.
science,ffa7tli,t1_ff9z260,1579729565.0,"I was one of the people that got bitch slapped by the swine flu years ago. Never have I ever been so sick in my damn life. It was awful. My whole life for at least two weeks was waking up, taking the cough syrup, and going back to sleep so I didn’t have to feel anything anymore. 

On the bright side I haven’t had the flu since then. If I have it was so mild that I just brushed it off as a cold. Reading through these comments though I’ll probably go ahead and start getting flu shots just so I don’t end up carrying it around to other more vulnerable people. I’d hate to cause someone else the hell of a bad flu."
assholedesign,ffa4v9w,t1_ffa3wbc,1579727924.0,So we’re not allowed to criticize anything about California if we want to benefit from some of the laws they have? How is wanting consumer protection laws in other states without wanting to live in California a bad thing? This is some silly nonsense right here.
aww,ffa41p1,t1_ffa0wz7,1579727460.0,"We just finally caught a feral kitten that’s been sleeping under our car for weeks. We took him to the vet to get checked out yesterday and he couldn’t hear anything over the crazy loud purring. So he’d back off, wait for it to stop, and the second he touched the kitten it started again lol. I was worried about the little guy being too wild but it turns out his main defense mechanism is to go limp and purr as hard as he can until the scary things go away."
specializedtools,ff8eiro,t1_ff8e6dw,1579675100.0,That makes more sense lol.
specializedtools,ff8b67a,t1_ff8b1r6,1579671563.0,I’d never say that either. Why would you think I would? If you understand where I’m coming from then why did you accuse me of not having empathy in the first place? If you’ve been there you should know better.

ScottishPeopleTwitter,feu8d2a,t1_fet6rba,1579384147.0,Wow a joke about cops and donuts. The boomer humor didn’t end with the comic I see.
rareinsults,fet81c5,t1_ferofcd,1579372602.0,It’s just you sinking to her level and being a complete hypocrite.
