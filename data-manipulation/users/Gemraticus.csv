A cat not very familiar with this bird would not have tolerated the bird even sidling up to it, let alone place foot, lean in, and get right on its face.

CaregiverSupport,fgbzs5n,t3_exegwq,1580667643.0,"Have you brought any of your feelings and frustrations up to your siblings at all? They are doing their own things, and trusting in you to care for mom. Maybe you are doing such a good job (and not complaining) that they haven't really given much thought to your needs. 

You might consider writing to them collectively (without blame or guilt) to let them know how this is effecting you and ask that they consider coordinating together with you in order to give you real, regular breaks. If they don't have the time, maybe they can pool some funds to help out. A weekly maid service, a person to watch your mom once a week. Or one of those prepared meal services. Maybe a gym membership for you (not for looks but for your mental health!). Whatever out takes to make your life a little more bearable.

And if your mom is mentally fine, and you have a good relationship with her (seems like you do) then maybe consider talking to her about your feelings (again, without blame or guilt) and tell her that she hurts you deeply when she is snippy with you and you never hear a word of praise from her. 

Caregiving is draining (it honestly sucks to feel obligated to put all of your energy into caring for others--ni matter the relationship--with no time left to care for yourself). Living with the person just increases the drain and ultimately tension between you. Being open about that tension can maybe allow you to work together to alleviate it.

You are dealing with a lot. I wish you the best."

CaregiverSupport,ffukkcp,t3_ev3fs9,1580243912.0,"""Pick your battles"" is good advice. And just as you are trying to get some compassion from those who were not talking care of his daily needs, an estranged daughter may have a very different perspective that also warrants empathy and compassion.

I know a lot of parents who were absolute crap parents the first time around. After some growing up and self-reflection, they then managed to do a better job of it the second (or maybe third) time around.

Estranged kids feel abandoned by their parent and don't understand how their parent could have treated them them so poorly while treating following children *so very well*, comparatively. It's a hard thing for somebody to wrap their head around. With the death of your father, there may never be any sort of resolution emotionally.

I don't know your situation but I think that compassion when dealing with this estranged daughter - even perhaps in the face of her animosity - will bring about the best resolution you can hope for."

I don't like the smell of a lot of things: cigarettes, brake dust, paper plants, any industrial animal farms, diesel engines, KFC, etc. Some of these smells are from legitimately hazardous things. They are not made illegal for their smell, though there are often *restrictions* on use.
