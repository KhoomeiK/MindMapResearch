ps3homebrew,ff3tnow,t1_ff3q9z1,1579548608.0,"well there are some preventative measures, but some of them are very extreme like pulling the Integrated Heat Spreader off the CELL and RSX but those have a very very high chance to brick your console. For me personally i jailbroke mine, swapped out the thermal paste with thermal grizzly kryonaut and kicked up the fan to keep it below 63C and its been fine since june. It does however get pretty loud sometimes so its a trade off low temps but loud fan or high temps and potentially dead system but lower noise.
