tumblr,ffp2zxv,t1_ffn7r53,1580085211.0,I have ADHD and this is one of my biggest problems along with hyper fixating. If I start to do something I can get totally lost and look up and it's fine from being 8pm to 11pm and it always confuses the hell out of me because my brain can't process the time difference.
disney,ffk0rnq,t3_etxrht,1580012302.0,This is amazing. This is some of the best stop animation I've seen in a while.
rupaulsdragrace,ffjmeu1,t1_ffi2fg7,1580001607.0,I feel like with Britta's name you don't need the Filter part exactly. Britta still sounds like a full name but poor Jan is just Jan now rather than Jan Sport.
AskReddit,ffjm5lm,t3_etouc5,1580001434.0,Me and my oldest cousin are close in age and both were involved with band but we went to two different high schools. When my cousin was a junior the band teacher at his school got accused of having sex with students and was arrested at the school during lunch time. It later came out that he had done it at several other schools he had previously worked at. The big thing that was shocking though was that it turned out his wife had known about at least the girl at my cousin's school and had talked to the girl about how she should stop sleeping with her husband because they were married and had kids. It spread pretty quickly because everybody at my high school knew people at the other high school. He ended up going to jail and his wife lost her teaching degree for 5 years and then she wasn't allowed to teach in certain areas following those 5 years. AFAIK she's gone back to teaching just in a different county and I think they're still married.
TheGoodPlace,ffjla77,t3_etw626,1580000839.0,"My favorite part of this scene will forever be the quote ""not with that attitude we can't."" As though Eleanor is down with murder in general. Always makes me laugh."
tumblr,ffjl3vq,t3_etsmgx,1580000719.0,Reminds me of when Sir Arthur Conan Doyle killed off Sherlock Holmes and his wife forced him to bring him back to life.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,ffjjxr4,t1_ffj6pt4,1579999921.0,A lot of phones once you officially disconnect them can't call other numbers. But most phones still allow you to call 911 because it's an emergency number. I have an older phone that can still call emergency numbers. The parent probably just didn't know.
tumblr,ffjjhma,t3_etxz7p,1579999626.0,My void likes to sneak around at night and lie in very inconvenient spots so that if I get up in the middle of the night to go the bathroom I have to shuffle around like an idiot.
AskReddit,ffjj91j,t3_etsjhz,1579999466.0,Queen Victoria's personal diaries had to be edited by her children before being released to the public because of how sexually explicit they were.
tumblr,ffjizpw,t3_etw13x,1579999299.0,I remember my school had these and I used to think they were special made because my schools colors had orange but then I found out they're all orange.
tumblr,ffjhx5p,t3_etw41k,1579998586.0,I always like the edge piece because if they're baked right then you get a crunch on the outer part and soft towards the middle.
rupaulsdragrace,ffjhamx,t3_ets7c5,1579998215.0,She's giving me sexy school marm.
AskReddit,ffibamn,t1_ffi1bec,1579969776.0,This is the one episode I will always watch the full credit ending because it's such a good and sad ending.
AskReddit,ffib5sp,t1_ffi23jk,1579969681.0,This one and the one where Homer thinks he's only has 24 hours to live so he spends it all with his family and then listens to the bible as he's waiting always kill me.
weddingshaming,ffia8fy,t1_ffi6pnz,1579969047.0,I feel like it's been around for a while now. I've seen a lot of camo weddings but I also live in the south.
tumblr,ffghlqp,t3_et8157,1579906416.0,"I hate when teachers do this just because it's not constructive at all like is the problem my grammar, structure, or does the thought just make no sense. Beats me because all you did was ?"
cats,ffggoit,t3_etdzrm,1579905823.0,Reminds me of the post about cats being taken out of burning buildings by firefighters and the white cat who looks insane.
AmItheAsshole,ffggc37,t3_etd5nx,1579905598.0,NTA sounds like a messy friend who is willing to talk about people behind their backs and then lie to their face. Also sounds like he's trying to be high and mighty just because he's a vegetarian. I think it's fair to say you got tired of it and cut contact.
AmItheAsshole,ffgfvzw,t3_et8jhn,1579905314.0,NTA. Your daughter is at an age where it's normal to want to try makeup. Just because your ex doesn't like it doesn't mean your daughter can't wear it when she's with you and the makeup you bought sounds like basic makeup not anything insanely expensive.
AmItheAsshole,ffgfecm,t1_fff8tnp,1579905005.0,Also OP didn't even invite Miles. Miles was invited through OP's friend from high school who was organizing the trip and the other girl dropped. Friend is acting ugly over something that OP had no control over.
AmItheAsshole,ffgegmt,t3_etfdp5,1579904416.0,NTA. But I think the bigger problem is that she's currently pregnant and planning on keeping the child and staying in the apartment which you don't want. You have the right to speak up and say you don't want to live with a child. Since she's early in her pregnancy she has time to look for a new place but the longer you hold off the more likely you are to end up living with a child.
AmItheAsshole,ffge2l8,t1_ffg3g4b,1579904171.0,The only orange I can think of that people might wear in the fall are more of a deep orangeish brown. Most can't wear regular orange because it's such a toss up color when it comes to shades.
AmItheAsshole,ffgdr18,t1_ffg1cmu,1579903972.0,Also it's not connected to the ex in anyway other than they were the artist. Sounds like the boyfriend is jealous which is stupid. NTA
AskReddit,ffgcd29,t3_et8871,1579903110.0,The Loch Ness Monster. The idea that there's just a prehistoric monster chilling in the lake and every once in a while it shows up is so fun to me. Also has the cute nickname of Nessie.
AskReddit,ffgbtfi,t1_fff9zr8,1579902778.0,Oh my cat does that too. I can throw her a soft toy and if she wants to play she'll go and get it and bring it back for me but people don't believe me because she's a cat. It's one of her favorite things to do.
tumblr,ffgbeht,t3_etbdib,1579902525.0,"""Do all my friends hate me or do I just need to go to sleep?"""
UnexpectedMulaney,ffgbair,t1_fffngue,1579902457.0,The image this comment provided me with is wonderful and hilarious.
rupaulsdragrace,ffe0y7o,t3_esz3dw,1579833862.0,I personally liked getting both because the themes were so opposite each other that I felt like I got to see more of each girls style.
asexuality,ffe0q3g,t1_ffdzqud,1579833699.0,You take your cars/house etc. keys usually on some sort of key ring and you put them in between each finger so that if you have to you can stab or scratch at someone. I do this if I'm walking alone.
AmItheAsshole,ffb0ba7,t3_escpq6,1579748649.0,NTA. My father is considered pretty good looking for his age and used to be a model and I will often get friends who make comments about him and how good he looks and they're always so awkward because he's my dad and I'm his daughter. I've had to tell people in the past to stop making it creepy especially when they start to go on about it.
AmItheAsshole,ffaz8qf,t1_ff9jezq,1579747927.0,Yeah at first I thought this was gonna be about OP having the change but not wanting to give it back but a nickel seems like a weird hill to die on when it comes to money.
TheSimpsons,ffayc4v,t3_esflvt,1579747326.0,This is one of my favorite scenes within one of my favorite episodes. The entire thing is hilarious especially the Mr. Thompson bit.
OSHA,ffaxf8b,t3_eshars,1579746724.0,Reminds me of when I was in highschool and they had the container where the first aid/AED machine was suppose to be in the gym but no first aid/AED. I had taken classes because I worked with children a lot and knew it was a violation. I went to the principal and asked if they could fix it and she said they would look into it. It took me bugging them for 6 months before they finally fixed it. Probably one of the proudest things I did during school.
MurderedByWords,ff9fdf3,t1_ff8z6fa,1579711827.0,Also some stores don't use size numbers for their women's clothes. I've seen stores that say plus size starts after 2XL or 3XL and after that the item is considered plus size.
MurderedByWords,ff9f45o,t1_ff8z0j1,1579711667.0,"My family has a lot of tall men, all around or over 6'5 and god forbid they want clothes that fit. People always ask why they can't find stuff at big and tall stores and they have to explain that they almost always only have stuff for big AND tall not just big or tall. A lot of my dad's clothes are bought and then adjusted."
AmItheAsshole,ff7yiaf,t3_erso9x,1579661392.0,"Even as someone in the LGBTQ community I know other people both in the community and not who don't like that word because of the history behind it. I personally don't mind it and it sounds like her friends don't mind if she uses it around them but that doesn't mean that every person she uses it around will agree with that. You have the right to say ""I'm not comfortable with that word, please stop."" Just because the pass works with her other friends doesn't mean it works with everybody. NTA"
AmItheAsshole,ff7x0je,t1_ff6ukjn,1579660366.0,"When I had to read it back in high school I remember the teacher prefaced us reading it by saying there were words in it that were considered okay for the time period but that when reading she would not force us to use the word and that if we didn't want to say it we could either skip it altogether or possibly use ""negro"" when reading aloud for context. I'm so glad our teacher didn't force us to have to read it and nobody should be forced to read something that makes them uncomfortable out loud. Definitely NTA"
tumblr,ff7uo1v,t1_ff6aayn,1579658782.0,That's my favorite part of the Winchester House just because it is literally a door to nowhere. It always makes me laugh.
AskReddit,ff6okcf,t1_ff69gn6,1579631606.0,This is what I do except mine is a white nightgown that could easily be thrown on but still covers everything.
AmItheAsshole,ff1v71r,t3_er1g9h,1579486907.0,NTA I know plenty of men who like to take care of themselves and their bodies with things such as mani-pedis or skin care routines. Just because those things are seen as typically feminine doesn't mean they're bad.
AmItheAsshole,ff1uw58,t3_er0svn,1579486719.0,NTA my family had a lab who was older and had several health problems that couldn't really be fixed because they came from old age. We tried to do everything we could for her but eventually it just got to the point that we had to put her to sleep because her quality of life was so low even with us regularly taking care of her. It sucks that it has to happen but it'll be better for the dogs rather than keep letting them suffer.
AmItheAsshole,ff1tsz8,t1_fey9g0y,1579486025.0,I think the big thing also is this isn't like it was one of OPs family members/spouse. You can't count this as a medical emergency. Most people aren't close enough to their roommates to drop everything at work and run to them.
AmItheAsshole,ff1tglh,t3_eqxw87,1579485800.0,NTA you're being paid to babysit the 3 year old. At the most you can ask the 16 year old to study but since you're actively babysitting a 3 year old you don't really have time to stand over the 16 year olds shoulder and force her to study.
rupaulsdragrace,ff1rvzg,t1_ff0fyr5,1579484808.0,I've heard some people say that the stadium was also way smaller than what was needed.
UnexpectedMulaney,ff1axgt,t3_er25mw,1579476940.0,My grandmother's dog does this. He'll start to sit and stare until you take him and put him in bed and turn out the lights.
AskReddit,fepss7d,t1_fep7tr6,1579330039.0,"Thought about going to see them back when Lindsey Buckingham was with them for a little bit a couple years ago and they happened to come  near but then he dropped out and we we're like ""nah not worth it without all of them"" and didn't go."
cats,feoushu,t3_eq08u8,1579305896.0,My cat does this. Especially when she wants attention. I call it her chirping call.
rupaulsdragrace,feott0c,t3_eq4yb4,1579305383.0,I love her so much almost every thing I see her in online is her smiling or being happy and it makes me happy.
tumblr,feltyko,t1_felsfk5,1579230868.0,Yeah I usually watch through it because it's so integral to the plot but I always feel so awkward.
tumblr,felosfr,t1_felfykw,1579227289.0,I worked a job in the Midwest over the summer and I got used to asking if they had sweet tea because a lot of places didn't have it and one time I asked and the waitress said yes they did so I happily ordered it because it had been forever since I'd had it. She brought me back unsweet tea that somebody had sprinkled sugar on top. I tried to mix it in but it was still unsweet. I stopped ordering sweet tea after that until I got back home after that.
aaaaaaacccccccce,feln0v1,t3_epo493,1579226078.0,I've had several people ask me this both about clothes and makeup. Like how dare I feel good about myself without having the dual purpose of attracting a mate.
tumblr,felmrzz,t3_eprqys,1579225910.0,I always do this whenever I'm watching any version of Pride and Prejudice because that first time Darcy proposes and gets absolutely destroyed by Elizabeth makes me want to crawl into a whole and never come out.
tumblr,felm5bf,t3_eprq9q,1579225474.0,Oh my god. I've done so many papers on health care for my college classes that I actually read it as the World Health Organization. I'm so done with college.
tumblr,felkk1d,t3_epi36k,1579224395.0,The craziest story I've ever heard was from my dad who ended up with a guy at the hospital ER at like 2 in the morning over a minor fall. My dad said if you want to see crazy shit just go stand in the ER and watch.
tumblr,felk76k,t3_epp585,1579224149.0,I've always had trouble with this because I have trouble comprehending speech a lot. You might have to say something more than once before my brain decides to put it together.
tumblr,feljypf,t3_epjw9k,1579223991.0,Reminds me of when Sir Arthur Conan Doyle killed off Sherlock Holmes and people straight up morned him like he was real and it wasn't until Doyle's wife forced him to bring him back to life that people calmed down.
weddingshaming,feljkt6,t1_fejw044,1579223726.0,Yeah or maybe send them to only close family and friends that you knew would find them funny. Like I know my aunt would find this hilarious but my grandparents would not. Gotta know your audience.
insaneparents,felh79u,t1_fekz8v2,1579222092.0,This is why I'm so happy that a lot of schools/daycare programs have started to require that children have their vaccinations. Anti-vax people who have insane ideas like this shouldn't be allowed to put their unvaccinated kids anywhere near.
AskReddit,felgs9w,t1_fejtfrs,1579221813.0,Reminds me of a pair of twins I knew in elementary school. Their parents didn't want them separated so they always had the same teacher and were often dressed similarly and occasionally they would do things like switch names and other things to confuse the teacher and everybody in class.
bridezillas,felghs5,t1_fej3995,1579221622.0,I did this with a pair of gloves that my family has. They're a pair of cloth gloves that belonged to my great great grandmother and my aunt and grandmother allowed me to wear them to a ball. I was incredibly careful with them the entire night and made sure they stayed safe until I was able to return them.
lgbt,fekbm9x,t1_fek0beg,1579196651.0,"I can't wait  to see people's response when I use this in the future. ""This is my joyfriend."" ""You mean boyfriend/girlfriend?"" ""No """
cats,feim6jg,t3_epa6jy,1579141782.0,Please tell me it's name is two-face.
asexuality,feiljjf,t3_ep9zog,1579141349.0,I had a prescription for a drug and it was packaged similarly. Always made me laugh that they reprinted it all over rather than just one big warning.
lgbt,feikz5k,t3_ep8yir,1579140963.0,This makes me want to buy a treadmill just to practice walking in heels.
tumblr,feikf0i,t1_fei12fh,1579140588.0,"Or the whole ""no tolerance policy"" that is such bullshit when a kid finally snaps back. They tried to fuck my brother over with it when he was in school."
tumblr,feijngy,t1_feif6dh,1579140068.0,Eh I think it depends on what you have to travel through from my college town back home is about 2 hours and it's pretty boring because it's mostly just rural area but coming back to my college town is better because there's more things to see as I get closer.
Scrubs,fei48j6,t1_fegdvor,1579129932.0,I was rewatching X-files and he's in a small part in an episode and he was so young looking I didn't know it was him until I saw his name.
rupaulsdragrace,fee8clf,t3_eom0cu,1579028490.0,She's serving spy coming for James Bond's job realness.
weddingshaming,fe9z1t2,t1_fe95ogb,1578942692.0,Also it's not like the pants had to be high end they just had to make it through one day and then he could go back to jeans.
asexuality,fe6pjkk,t1_fe62w3t,1578899447.0,The style must be coming back because when I got my new pair I got ones similar to this and there were a lot of them.
AskReddit,fe584q0,t1_fe2d4sy,1578866470.0,I'm from a small town and my cousin's uncle through their father committed suicide and my aunt told me that she had to go and help the wife scrub blood from the room because there was no official crew to help clean only to remove the body.
AmItheAsshole,fe56pj3,t3_ent15f,1578866098.0,NTA I hate when people do this and expect you to understand what they want. If she truly wants to go then she just needs to outright ask. If not then I would continue to ignore these hints.
AmItheAsshole,fe55h18,t1_fe3ba1i,1578865801.0,Also most of that stuff isn't exactly cheap. He's regularly using stuff that she's buying with her own money and then getting mad when she asks him not to because she bought it. NTA
AmItheAsshole,fe54ocw,t3_enqsbe,1578865620.0,NTA nobody wants to hear her conversation whether they're studying or not. I'm sure you asking her to turn off the speaker made a lot of people happy especially if it was as crowded as it sounds.
AmItheAsshole,fe54bsc,t1_fe1u54a,1578865502.0,I think this is the big thing. It's not that OP doesn't want her to smoke it's that she's regularly spending so much money on so little and quickly blowing through it.
AmItheAsshole,fe53mpr,t1_fe3l3od,1578865377.0,Yeah and I've even met bartenders who do this because if the person is drunk enough they can't tell and it gets them to back off.
AmItheAsshole,fe521j2,t3_ensbqt,1578864992.0,NTA this mother claims you're the one keeping your son from the deaf community but it kinda sounds like he's already decided that he doesn't want to be in contact with that community as much anymore. As for being honest she asked why and you told her why so that's that.
AmItheAsshole,fe51aq0,t1_fe4g4vt,1578864739.0,I get why people have emotional support animals but I've never quite gotten why they can't just be kept at home. Somebody who knows more about service dogs might be able to tell me but if you had some sort of mental health issue where you needed a dog in order to go outside wouldn't you be able to get an actual trained dog? Also I've had people tell me to register my cat as a ESA so I don't have to pay for her in apartments and I feel like that's probably illegal.
AmItheAsshole,fe4zrvn,t3_enriuc,1578864313.0,NTA. It's one thing to feed the cat when it comes around but to purposely take off the collar and change it after you've explained that it's your cat and just happens to like being outdoor is just absolutely rude.
AmItheAsshole,fe4x19l,t3_eno7q1,1578863580.0,NTA you don't pay money for her to get to test her new skills on you. Also it sounds like it isn't the first complaint so if it wasn't you it would've kept happening until someone else complained.
tumblr,fe4wq52,t3_enoup0,1578863466.0,If this is real then this sounds amazing. Especially as a introvert for a date. Sit in silence and read.
IAmA,fe4t1x9,t1_fe4iyzq,1578862518.0,Seriously as a college student I wouldn't be able to afford my therapist if my school didn't provide free counseling. Why would a school that supposedly wants to help students ask for that much.
asexuality,fe4ncgf,t3_enqswf,1578861085.0,Oh my god I love blackberries so much. We get fresh ones from my grandfather in the summer and I ways make cobbler with them. Maybe I should try something like this.
AmItheAsshole,fe4lwhm,t1_fe2pe5k,1578860669.0,Also birth control is a pill that you have to take everyday for it to work like I take mine for epilepsy if I stop taking it I might have a seizure. It's not like Viagra where you can take it as needed.
rupaulsdragrace,fdz9wes,t1_fdylnq7,1578788087.0,That one was so weird for me because I could never tell if they actually knew who Vanjie was or if they were just saying it.

AmItheAsshole,fdxrvs8,t3_en6hb4,1578772268.0,NTA everybody reacts differently to a person's passing and you reacted in what would be considered a happy way. Your family seems to think that because you didn't cry that means you didn't love him which just isn't true.
rupaulsdragrace,fdxpiw9,t1_fdwz5jy,1578771563.0,I always assumed it had to be either Trixie or Shangela because they were the two who had been doing the best and could be considered a threat.
HistoryPorn,fdxp51v,t1_fdxjpz4,1578771425.0,I thought The Crown did a good job of showing what the the Great Smog was like. I can't imagine living in a place with that much smog.
weddingshaming,fdxlnzk,t1_fdt87xt,1578770235.0,Yeah I enjoy doing makeup and experimenting with my own makeup but I would never be able to do somebody else's especially if it meant having to buy new products. I don't think this bride realizes how much it costs for a full face of products.
cats,fdnzkux,t1_fdndmsr,1578596055.0,"I do this too and I always tell her ""we're almost there then you can be free"" she always sounds so upset to be in the carrier but she's not calm enough to only be in her harness in the car."

tumblr,fdmmv21,t3_elyxkf,1578556045.0,Honestly though I feel this like I just want to see how you've decorated your rooms. Don't want to steal items just ideas.
cats,fdmmsnv,t3_em468d,1578555967.0,Sounds like my cat. I have a sliding closet door and I openedit to look for something and when I wasn't looking she snuck in and I shut the door. Looked for hours and it wasn't till I heard her meows that I found her.
AmItheAsshole,fdm533v,t1_fdkum27,1578539997.0,I can say as someone who grew up in a small school in part of the Bible belt that even in school you didn't ever hear about somebody being gay. I only knew because of my parents. I didn't meet someone who was anything other than straight until my final year of highschool and they transferred in.
AmItheAsshole,fdm4vir,t1_fdkdsi6,1578539850.0,And it's not like they described it in a overly explicit way. Sounds like the parents are just bigoted.
insaneparents,fdm1wa2,t1_fdluznk,1578537842.0,"We learned about these in my biology class and I was like ""hey, sounds familiar"""
AskReddit,fdm1l5w,t1_fdkwqa2,1578537634.0,"Reminds me of that post about the dad mowing the lawn really early in the morning and the kid asking him how he saw and he just answered moon.

AmItheAsshole,ffaz8qf,t1_ff9jezq,1579747927.0,Yeah at first I thought this was gonna be about OP having the change but not wanting to give it back but a nickel seems like a weird hill to die on when it comes to money.
TheSimpsons,ffayc4v,t3_esflvt,1579747326.0,This is one of my favorite scenes within one of my favorite episodes. The entire thing is hilarious especially the Mr. Thompson bit.
OSHA,ffaxf8b,t3_eshars,1579746724.0,Reminds me of when I was in highschool and they had the container where the first aid/AED machine was suppose to be in the gym but no first aid/AED. I had taken classes because I worked with children a lot and knew it was a violation. I went to the principal and asked if they could fix it and she said they would look into it. It took me bugging them for 6 months before they finally fixed it. Probably one of the proudest things I did during school.
MurderedByWords,ff9fdf3,t1_ff8z6fa,1579711827.0,Also some stores don't use size numbers for their women's clothes. I've seen stores that say plus size starts after 2XL or 3XL and after that the item is considered plus size.
MurderedByWords,ff9f45o,t1_ff8z0j1,1579711667.0,"My family has a lot of tall men, all around or over 6'5 and god forbid they want clothes that fit. People always ask why they can't find stuff at big and tall stores and they have to explain that they almost always only have stuff for big AND tall not just big or tall. A lot of my dad's clothes are bought and then adjusted."
AmItheAsshole,ff7yiaf,t3_erso9x,1579661392.0,"Even as someone in the LGBTQ community I know other people both in the community and not who don't like that word because of the history behind it. I personally don't mind it and it sounds like her friends don't mind if she uses it around them but that doesn't mean that every person she uses it around will agree with that. You have the right to say ""I'm not comfortable with that word, please stop."" Just because the pass works with her other friends doesn't mean it works with everybody. NTA"
AmItheAsshole,ff7x0je,t1_ff6ukjn,1579660366.0,"When I had to read it back in high school I remember the teacher prefaced us reading it by saying there were words in it that were considered okay for the time period but that when reading she would not force us to use the word and that if we didn't want to say it we could either skip it altogether or possibly use ""negro"" when reading aloud for context. I'm so glad our teacher didn't force us to have to read it and nobody should be forced to read something that makes them uncomfortable out loud. Definitely NTA"

AmItheAsshole,ff1v71r,t3_er1g9h,1579486907.0,NTA I know plenty of men who like to take care of themselves and their bodies with things such as mani-pedis or skin care routines. Just because those things are seen as typically feminine doesn't mean they're bad.
AmItheAsshole,ff1uw58,t3_er0svn,1579486719.0,NTA my family had a lab who was older and had several health problems that couldn't really be fixed because they came from old age. We tried to do everything we could for her but eventually it just got to the point that we had to put her to sleep because her quality of life was so low even with us regularly taking care of her. It sucks that it has to happen but it'll be better for the dogs rather than keep letting them suffer.
AmItheAsshole,ff1tsz8,t1_fey9g0y,1579486025.0,I think the big thing also is this isn't like it was one of OPs family members/spouse. You can't count this as a medical emergency. Most people aren't close enough to their roommates to drop everything at work and run to them.
AmItheAsshole,ff1tglh,t3_eqxw87,1579485800.0,NTA you're being paid to babysit the 3 year old. At the most you can ask the 16 year old to study but since you're actively babysitting a 3 year old you don't really have time to stand over the 16 year olds shoulder and force her to study.

tumblr,felosfr,t1_felfykw,1579227289.0,I worked a job in the Midwest over the summer and I got used to asking if they had sweet tea because a lot of places didn't have it and one time I asked and the waitress said yes they did so I happily ordered it because it had been forever since I'd had it. She brought me back unsweet tea that somebody had sprinkled sugar on top. I tried to mix it in but it was still unsweet. I stopped ordering sweet tea after that until I got back home after that.
aaaaaaacccccccce,feln0v1,t3_epo493,1579226078.0,I've had several people ask me this both about clothes and makeup. Like how dare I feel good about myself without having the dual purpose of attracting a mate.
tumblr,felmrzz,t3_eprqys,1579225910.0,I always do this whenever I'm watching any version of Pride and Prejudice because that first time Darcy proposes and gets absolutely destroyed by Elizabeth makes me want to crawl into a whole and never come out.
tumblr,felm5bf,t3_eprq9q,1579225474.0,Oh my god. I've done so many papers on health care for my college classes that I actually read it as the World Health Organization. I'm so done with college.
tumblr,felkk1d,t3_epi36k,1579224395.0,The craziest story I've ever heard was from my dad who ended up with a guy at the hospital ER at like 2 in the morning over a minor fall. My dad said if you want to see crazy shit just go stand in the ER and watch.
tumblr,felk76k,t3_epp585,1579224149.0,I've always had trouble with this because I have trouble comprehending speech a lot. You might have to say something more than once before my brain decides to put it together.
tumblr,feljypf,t3_epjw9k,1579223991.0,Reminds me of when Sir Arthur Conan Doyle killed off Sherlock Holmes and people straight up morned him like he was real and it wasn't until Doyle's wife forced him to bring him back to life that people calmed down.
weddingshaming,feljkt6,t1_fejw044,1579223726.0,Yeah or maybe send them to only close family and friends that you knew would find them funny. Like I know my aunt would find this hilarious but my grandparents would not. Gotta know your audience.
insaneparents,felh79u,t1_fekz8v2,1579222092.0,This is why I'm so happy that a lot of schools/daycare programs have started to require that children have their vaccinations. Anti-vax people who have insane ideas like this shouldn't be allowed to put their unvaccinated kids anywhere near.
AskReddit,felgs9w,t1_fejtfrs,1579221813.0,Reminds me of a pair of twins I knew in elementary school. Their parents didn't want them separated so they always had the same teacher and were often dressed similarly and occasionally they would do things like switch names and other things to confuse the teacher and everybody in class.
bridezillas,felghs5,t1_fej3995,1579221622.0,I did this with a pair of gloves that my family has. They're a pair of cloth gloves that belonged to my great great grandmother and my aunt and grandmother allowed me to wear them to a ball.

asexuality,fe6pjkk,t1_fe62w3t,1578899447.0,The style must be coming back because when I got my new pair I got ones similar to this and there were a lot of them.

AmItheAsshole,fe56pj3,t3_ent15f,1578866098.0,NTA I hate when people do this and expect you to understand what they want. If she truly wants to go then she just needs to outright ask. If not then I would continue to ignore these hints.
AmItheAsshole,fe55h18,t1_fe3ba1i,1578865801.0,Also most of that stuff isn't exactly cheap. He's regularly using stuff that she's buying with her own money and then getting mad when she asks him not to because she bought it. NTA
AmItheAsshole,fe54ocw,t3_enqsbe,1578865620.0,NTA nobody wants to hear her conversation whether they're studying or not. I'm sure you asking her to turn off the speaker made a lot of people happy especially if it was as crowded as it sounds.
AmItheAsshole,fe54bsc,t1_fe1u54a,1578865502.0,I think this is the big thing. It's not that OP doesn't want her to smoke it's that she's regularly spending so much money on so little and quickly blowing through it.
AmItheAsshole,fe53mpr,t1_fe3l3od,1578865377.0,Yeah and I've even met bartenders who do this because if the person is drunk enough they can't tell and it gets them to back off.

As for being honest she asked why and you told her why so that's that.
AmItheAsshole,fe51aq0,t1_fe4g4vt,1578864739.0,I get why people have emotional support animals but I've never quite gotten why they can't just be kept at home. Somebody who knows more about service dogs might be able to tell me but if you had some sort of mental health issue where you needed a dog in order to go outside wouldn't you be able to get an actual trained dog? Also I've had people tell me to register my cat as a ESA so I don't have to pay for her in apartments and I feel like that's probably illegal.
AmItheAsshole,fe4zrvn,t3_enriuc,1578864313.0,NTA. It's one thing to feed the cat when it comes around but to purposely take off the collar and change it after you've explained that it's your cat and just happens to like being outdoor is just absolutely rude.
AmItheAsshole,fe4x19l,t3_eno7q1,1578863580.0,NTA you don't pay money for her to get to test her new skills on you. Also it sounds like it isn't the first complaint so if it wasn't you it would've kept happening until someone else complained.

IAmA,fe4t1x9,t1_fe4iyzq,1578862518.0,Seriously as a college student I wouldn't be able to afford my therapist if my school didn't provide free counseling. Why would a school that supposedly wants to help students ask for that much.
