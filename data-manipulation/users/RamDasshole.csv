They used the purchase price parity median income which is used to do an apples to apples comparison by adjusting for different cost of living across countries. So that much is valid, but if you're curious as to the economic reasons why this person is making poor arguments, here it is:

>Checked it out and their interest rate on mortgages is quite a bit lower than in the US. Denmark even has a 10 year fixed loan with a negative interest rate. 

Since debt servicing is highly correlated to housing price changes, and mortgage debt makes up a majority of personal debt, it makes sense that a country with lower proportional debt servicing costs would have a higher amount of debt. Additionally, I would argue that mortgage debt isn't really net debt because its backed by an appreciating asset. You can sell the house and the longer you hold it, the more likely you are to sell at a higher price than you bought it at. This is in contrast to student debt where there's literally no asset attached or consumer debt where the asset is likely worth much less than the purchase price over time. 

The tax rate you cited appears to be the maximum level, not the average. The average single person in Denmark pays 35.8% compared to the US at 23.8% according to this OECD table.

https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=Table_I6#

I'd gladly pay higher taxes for guaranteed healthcare (even if you lost your job, which can't be said in America) and paid higher education. All in all it's probably around 25% higher taxes. 

However, considering that healthcare easily costs over $10k per person a year in the US and considering the average debt that Americans take on for higher ed is now around $37k, it more than pays for itself unless you're wealthy, in which case you don't need to be too worried about money anyways. And let's not forget that they have a better overall social safety net as well. For example, guaranteed paid family leave and 6 weeks of vacation a year! 

You cited that their unemployment rate is higher. This is misleading because they actually have a higher employment rate (73.2 vs 70.1), which is a better metric. Unemployment rate is deceiving because it only measures people looking for a job, and not those who have dropped out of the labor market, whereas employment rate shows the total number of employed divided by total population.

television,ff2hzxx,t1_ff1tldz,1579506979.0,">I don't disagree with anything you said, nor did the framers. 

They weren't a monolith. Some of them clearly did or else we wouldn't have these ridiculous laws. 

>Thus they created a bicameral legislature and it is known/was known as the great compromise. 

I hate when people romanticize this. You know they decided to make black people worth 3/5 of a person at that convention too, right?  

They created a system that is designed to force compromise that benefits small states. It causes gridlock when the will of the small states isn't congruent with that of the majority of the people.. either the majority gives in to the smaller states or nothing gets done. clearly its a flawed system to say the least. 

>So California has vast influence in the lower house but exactly the same as either Dakota in the upper house.

39.5 million people in California. 40.3 million people in the 22 smallest states COMBINED. Just about the same population, but because of where they live, the other states get 44 senate seats to Cali's 2.  The 4 largest states have a third the population and only 8 seats. That's stupid as fuck.


>The electoral college issue is another beast. 

The result of this system is that in this election the state of Wyoming cast about 210,000 votes, and thus each elector represented 70,000 votes, while in California approximately 9,700,000 votes were cast for 54 votes, thus representing 179,000 votes per electorate. This creates an unfair advantage to voters in the small states whose votes count more than those people living in medium and large states.

It would seem to be a similar beast as far as fucking over people in large states. 

>All I know is the framers wrote the Constitution and I have to believe that they thought about these issues and what they would mean far into the future. 

Dude, a mere 2 years after the constitutional convention, they had to make the first 10 amendments...  They were nowhere near omniscient, and they knew it. Stop putting them on a pedestal. 


>But that also makes me an originalist and I know many disagree with the strict interpretation of the Constitution.


People disagree with you because it's not a fucking proclamation from god, its fallible laws written by fallible men. Why the fuck else would the founders have made amendments possible? They knew the situation would change and the constitution would have to as well. Your position assumes a static equilibrium, which is flawed thinking. Our inability to pass sensible reform and adapt to new challenges is our greatest weakness and it's mostly because of the electoral college and senate. 

>Our country is coming to a head and God knows how it ends. 

We're an empire and we've overstretched... how does that usually end? 

>Virginia is literally getting ready to take rights guaranteed within the Constitution. And since it's a Federal law and a literal constitutional amendment, many would argue the citizens have every legal right to say fuck you. 

I know nothing of the politics of Virginia besides that it flipped blue. Not sure what you're talking about.

2. The Dakota's COMBINED have 1.6 million. 

That means that someone from Dakota has 23 times the voting power of someone from California in senatorial elections.

Whether that's worth it or not is up to you to decide. 

My brother has a masters in chem and does research in industry.  its a field where a bachelors pays ~40k starting out and a masters substantially more, but a phd only pays slightly better than a masters in industry. This is according to him at least, and is a big part of why he didn't go for a phd."
