JUSTNOFAMILY,ffijs4e,t1_ffibs1j,1579975546.0,It’s also a regionalism.  Some places are more likely to use different word choices than others.
fatlogic,ffiimcu,t1_ffi6bj6,1579974755.0,"I have a friend I’d call 50% gluten free.  His wife is sensitive enough that’s she’s reacted to what he eats if it’s the same day, but travels a fair bit for work so he’s gluten free at home but he eats it when he’s away from her.  I doubt that’s what she means."
WritingPrompts,ffclwso,t1_ffcgnkv,1579802242.0,Dogs aren’t.  They’re more obligate omnivores than anything. They don’t do well on either entirely vegetarian or vegan diets or on all meat diets.
actuallesbians,ffciqvm,t1_ffcf0c0,1579800333.0,Big mood.
fatlogic,ffcfxvu,t1_ffa087q,1579798614.0,Yep where as I wear high waisted pants so that they come up right under my navel and don’t make my legs look short.   I’m all torso I swear.
fatlogic,ff9klht,t1_ff95ovh,1579714980.0,I’ve been there and progress can be so slow when you’re starting off but there are places that can and will support you.  I lost most of my first push with r/loseit and it and this subreddit have been huge helps in teaching me how to eat in a sustainable way.
news,ff60o7d,t1_ff4jbz1,1579616103.0,They didn’t do that in 1991 though which was the last time he was on police radar.
JUSTNOMIL,ff3die9,t1_ff39nr0,1579538932.0,"Crossing state lines in general depends on location.  In this case the crossing is egregious but when I was growing up the state line was half a block from my house.  We would go out of state to pick up pizza.  My grandparents wouldn’t have asked specifically to take us over that state line, but they certainly wouldn’t have taken us on a plane."
fatlogic,feflfc8,t1_fef2nr4,1579058828.0,Don’t stop taking your meds.  Do talk to your doctor.  If you’re sure on your calories you might be retaining water.  Sometimes that can happen when you start a new med.
fatlogic,fefgfbn,t1_fefcvzp,1579055786.0,Rants can be happy.  I’m super proud of a friend of mine who is down thirty so we can be happy and supportive together.  I love it when people support each other’s goals instead of tearing them down.
ABraThatFits,fecrnao,t3_eod8mx,1578982023.0,Coobie makes comfy stretchy bralettes.  They’re pretty decent with my sensory issues.
AmItheAsshole,fe9rgcf,t1_fe9lion,1578940866.0,"Legally, a receipt is a form of contract.  It’s a simple contact with terms of money for a good but they still fall under contract law.

fatlogic,fe6wn8v,t3_en8h4h,1578906697.0,I’m back to eating at a deficit after taking December off for maintenance.  Sadly the scale is being stubborn but I’m hoping I can convince it to move soon.
news,fe3yg3i,t1_fe3wc6r,1578853978.0,Exactly.  Death to traffic is what you yell in Iranian if your commute took you an extra ten minutes.  Death is their go to annoyance swear.
fatlogic,fe2jp39,t1_fe0mlzw,1578839192.0,"Because they’re talking about going to a surgical consult, not the actual surgery."
fatlogic,fdy9oxj,t1_fdy4ep0,1578777514.0,Yep.  Plus sized petite is even a thing.  At 5’4” you’re petite the same way I look for tall shirts at 5’10”.  It’s the height axis not the width.
fatlogic,fdrjfz9,t1_fdraz31,1578685341.0,"Honestly, go with either empire waists or dresses that you belt instead of having a defined waist on their own. That way you can move the waist around."

FondantHate,fdrh2ss,t1_fdnw4x0,1578684486.0,It’s clearly full of love and it shows. Love feels a lot like safety when it’s this pure and warm.
fatlogic,fdnnz95,t1_fdneyn6,1578589712.0,Korean food has the best pickles.  So many tasty pickled things.  So tasty.
fatlogic,fdm3a6r,t1_fdkm007,1578538784.0,And some people try really hard while not knowing what the fuck they’re doing which leads them to failing.   See me before I found CICO and I couldn’t out gym my fork and my healthy food still had too many calories.   I was taking all sorts of diet advice and working hard.  I just was taking bad diet advice.
fatlogic,fdln6be,t3_eltwdx,1578527824.0,"I’m plateauing hard but I’m trying to get on track by cooking everything from scratch.  Today was lamb stew for lunch, carrots and humus for breakfast, and mashed cauliflower with cheese for dinner."
ladyladyboners,fdk5ufu,t1_fdjxfff,1578496753.0,She leans into them.  Adds a little dark around her eyes so they help make her eyes look larger.  Sometimes the trick isn’t to hide who you are.  Just lean in.
TrollXChromosomes,fdj4m15,t1_fdj1h26,1578458304.0,"I stick mine in a ponytail, braid the pony tail, then wrap the braid around itself again and again and again, tuck the end under, and then jab a giant metal spike through it.  Works pretty well for me. Of course I do the same thing without the pony tail or the braid half the time.  Metal pointy things seem to be the important bits."
lesbianfashionadvice,fdhv5vi,t3_elgdpi,1578430713.0,I live in mine three quarters of the year so yes.
bigboobproblems,fdhnnji,t1_fdh3r7g,1578426478.0,Bowling. I keep knocking my arms out of position with my boobs when I try to bowl straight because my boobs are wider than my ribs.

fatlogic,fdej2z3,t1_fdeef45,1578340097.0,No more than 1% of your body weight a week.  It scales as you get heavier and lighter.  1-2 is generally a good rule of thumb for most people but there are outliers.
pagan,fd9xt3y,t1_fd9js2d,1578239311.0,Not OP but spritz them with alcohol and hydrogen peroxide. Blow dry them.  Then stick them in an airtight bag for a week.
fatlogic,fczg8wb,t1_fcz50t7,1578100580.0,I’m 5’10” 170 and a woman and I am called thin way more than justified. I carry all my weight in my hips and thighs so I look thinner than I am.  Weight distribution can trick the eye.
fatlogic,fcnrobo,t1_fcnaae2,1577817140.0,I hope they sort things out so you can get back up to a healthy weight.
fatlogic,fc9d933,t1_fc91lia,1577550857.0,"It depends on what you mean by can be changed.  Religion can technically be changed, but faith is not so easily swayed and religious discrimination is still discrimination.  People used the argument that gay people could change to discriminate against them.  This was horse shit but they still did it.  

Diet is proven to be a cure for obesity, but obesity is also a symptom of addiction so one should be compassionate for their struggles while still realising that it’s unhealthy and that most of their “oppression” is not caused by people but by physics."
TrollXChromosomes,fc0x1o2,t1_fc0h7mr,1577301969.0,"I look super jaundiced in pink.  It’s just a bad colour on me.  I like it on other people, it just doesn’t suit me and that’s how colours should be."
