I am all for getting rid of fat shaming, I think we should positively encourage people to be healthy. 

To me, celebrating and praising an unhealthy lifestyle solely as opposition to overly harsh criticism of said unhealthy lifestyle, had led to enabling a, well, unhealthy lifestyle. 

Should you insult and slander anyone who is overweight? No. 

Should you compliment and potentially encourage overweight lifestyles? *Hell no.* 

Being fat is being unhealthy. *Period.*
