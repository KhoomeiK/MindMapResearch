I've heard a lot said about the excellence of the doubling dice, which honestly is a great bit of design. It says to the opponent, ""forfeit now, or this round will be worth twice as much.

They are not particularly social creatures, and if I put a male in the same tank then it would stress her out as she'd constantly be having to move to not be pestered (two females might bicker, but would probably ignore each other). A human needs socialisation and stimulation appropriate to their level, and you must know your comparison is bunk on that basis.

My turtle ownership is win/win, where she gets an easy life and we both get to enjoy each others' company. Sure, it's different to in the wild, but in the wild she'd be dead already."

I know she has less space, but like I said - the tank is not a fortress, and she is not exploring outwards. She's very friendly towards people that walk in front of her tank, though, because she knows that's where food comes from.

In the same vein, if you lived in the woods you'd have more space, and be closer to how humans lived in the wild, right? What keeps you away from that? For me, it's because it's harder, and colder, and if I didn't find enough food I might die. The same logic is true for my turtle, except she's likely to get eaten by predators too."
CasualUK,ffeuw6e,t1_ffeurqg,1579866585.0,"Not even a little. The turtle lives a life free from danger and stressors, and gets easy regular food. I think it takes a very romanticised view of the wild to think that they're living better lives."

It's not a tightly sealed tank and she could escape if she wished, but her life there seems pretty great. In the wild, something would probably have eaten her by now (as so few make it to adulthood), but here she can live until she's 30 years old.

Suggesting she'd be happier in the wild is a bit like saying a human would be happier living in the woods without central heating or electricity, scavenging for meat rather than farming it.

This is super interesting. It is data which could have alternative interpretations, though. For example, what if fathers are likely to only report abuse in the most extreme cases, because society conditions people into thinking that men are bigger and can't be abused?
