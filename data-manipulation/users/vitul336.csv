AskReddit,ffg54ax,t3_etbrdf,1579898657.0,"I had a welsh corgi when I was a kid that was an absolute mad lad. A few notable things this dog did were:     
    
- Climbing up on the top of our fence to watch for birds flying by. He would jump off and catch them mid- air so he could leave them dead on my doorstep. This was an almost daily routine.    
    
- My mom left him at my dads while we went to visit family. He escaped, and made the 20 mile trek from my dads back to my moms in a week by himself.      
    
- Did the same thing again, but first he somehow climbed out of a 10 ft kennel my dad set up on an attempt to keep him contained.    
    
- He had been run over by a vehicle twice. Both times I witnessed him being run over. Both times he went under the tire. Both times I took him to the vet, only for them to tell me he had no injuries. Not even a limp. One of the vehicles was a uhaul. 
     
- He almost killed both of my neighbor’s two German shepherds, who came into our yard one night and attacked our other dog. He came out of that with a small cut above his eye, and our other dog was unharmed. The two sheps both had wounds to the throat and face, and one had a broken front leg. The neighbor had my dog put on the registry as “dangerous”, and we were then required by local law to have him muzzled when we took him for walks. Again, my dog was a welsh corgi, and had never bitten anyone human.       
    
- He escaped my fathers house a third time, after being locked in the finished basement. He somehow climbed up the brick wall and broke through the tiny window that was just above ground level. He made the same journey he had done twice before, but unfortunately was shot along the way this time. He was taken to the vet, but passed away from infection.     He was 12 years old when he died.       
       
God that dog was a handful but I adored him. His name was Porkchop. I’ve never had another dog quite like him ever since."
