pics,fe49l5l,t1_fdyml1d,1578857066.0,"Teddy Roosevelt split 30% of all of his time writing and another 20% reading. The other 50% went to his ruggedness upbringing. 

Teddy came from the arguably aristocratic Rosevelt family. His father was a great philanthropist who helped the poor and tried to support many civil causes. 
Theodore Senior died at 46.

Teddy always placed most of his admiration for his father since without his father's words of encouragement to overcome his health weaknesses, Teddy wouldn't have gone along the path he did. 

""You must make yourself stronger to overcome your weaknesses"" - because of his Asthma which was a life threatening condition back then. 

He took similar words of encouragement to heart and took it upon himself to forge himself into a stronger man and a better person.  

Ron Swanson is not Teddy. I'm sure he admires him. I'm sure most people admire Teddy when they can further understand his accomplishments despite his own issues. And for having a very left leaning mindset in regards to serving the people, something sorely lacking in the modern day. TDRs resolution to stick behind his principles & morals shows itself when he went against his entire party to create his Bull Moose party in opposition of his former colleagues.  

Teddy was blinded in his left eye when he partook in a boxing fight in the white house.  
Years later after he lost his Bull Moose party initiative he continued on his adventure plans. He traversed the River of Doubt successfully. A place filled with innumerous risks & dangers into uncharted territory. 

His only folly characteristically was on this voyage where instead of bringing a man to justice, he let the Jungle dispense its justice upon him, due to their dire situation and the situation of his remaining crew.  

Teddy. Was a grand old lion. 

His children suffered. One committed a form of modernly understood suicide - just like Teddys brother. Another died as a war pilot. 

A life INTENTIONALLY filled filled with suffrage and toil and one afforded the ability of some family wealth to foster himself into a Titan. 

Typically with wealth, we seek to avoid suffrage. Teddy embraced and sought it out. That's the image of a truely selfless individual. 

Have a great day. I strongly suggest reading some TDR books.  He wasn't called Teddy until in the White House. His family nickname was ""TD"" cause he was Tiny. (Like Teenee). But he still attributed much of his character and direction to his unfortunately short lived father Theodore Rosevelt Senior."

He proceeded to laugh at me calling me a moron while I finished my statement...

""Knowing how to best use that knowledge is what actually makes you intelligent, since if you can't put it to use or get someone else to, it makes it completely irrelevant, besides to inflate your self esteem by trying to impress others with what you know"".
