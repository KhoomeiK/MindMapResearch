bulletjournal,ffiln22,t3_etr3j0,1579976830.0,"I have been using [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07RT8LRGC?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title) as my bujo supplies bag since the beginning of the month, and I LOVE it. There are a lot of bags not marketed as pen/pencil cases that have nice setups. I wanted something that I wouldn't have to dump everything out to see the things I want use in that journal session. You can get smaller ones similar to this too."
