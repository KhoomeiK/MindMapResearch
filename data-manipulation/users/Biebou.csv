Sorry, but he's a 13 year old idiot asshole, who finds it amusing to make people uncomfortable. You can do better, and you will.
My husband has rancid farts, and he has them often. But, he apologizes and will usually try to leave the room when he can. Most of the time we laugh about it, but only because he acts like a normal person. If he acted like your dude, I never would have stayed long enough to have married him. There's no excuse for your bf's behavior."

I do know how to use an umbrella, but aside from a light weather resistant jacket, I have no idea what I should buy. I don't want to buy cheaply made stuff, but I also don't want to buy stuff that's over priced. What type of jackets, boots, pants, and other type of gear should I focus on initially? What brands are reasonably priced and stand the test of time? What about gear for toddlers? I tend to run cold, so I want stuff that'll keep me dry and warm.

Edit: we'll be moving to the western side, most likely close to the sound, maybe in the rain shadow."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fep8y9g,t3_eq8it9,1579314798.0,"I never realized just how much strength and agility it takes to be a professional ballet dancer until I went to a free outdoor performance in my town. It was awesome; before the performance, the dancers were warming up on the open stage (no music) and I was surprised at how loud their breathing and thuds every landing of a leap was. You don't hear any of that when the music is playing and the dancers make it look so effortless and graceful that you'd think they would be silent like butterflies or something. Ballet dancers are beasts."
