One day, we heard this loud crash just outside her bedroom window.  I told her to stay where she was and ran out to see what was going on.  A drunk driver had crash into this huge oak tree in her yard.  The car was totaled, but the tree just had a small bald spot.  I went back in for the cordless phone and my mom (a nurse) went to help.  There was a little girl, maybe 8 or 9, in the front seat with a huge gash on her forehead and a broken arm.  The dad, who was driving, was a little scratched up and trying to move around.  My mom stabilized the little girl’s neck and I tried to stabilize the dad but he was belligerent, so I just got out of the way and let him wander the yard to keep him away from mom helping the little girl.  The police showed up a few minutes later and then an ambulance.  We never found out what happened to either of them. They were from a few towns over, I think."

I explained to her my concerns and histories, and she prescribed a single Valium to take at my next appointment.

She walked me through the appointment slowly and stopped when I asked, and we got everything done.

That would be my recommendation.  Ask for a pre-appointment and explain your history.  Ask for something to relax you, and for a doctor (female was important to me) who can take her time and talk you through everything.  That way you still feel like you are in control.  Make a game plan at the first appointment.  What’s the most important thing to accomplish?

No, at the very beginning this country was a country of indigenous people (my people, by the way, feel free to peruse my history) that let swarms of illegal invaders come in.

I know my history, and I know this is a repeat of what happened.  You lose your land, you get exposed to diseases that kill you, you lose your language as the invader language takes over, and eventually you are relegated to becoming a fourth rate citizen in your own country.
