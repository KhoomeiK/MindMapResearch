news,ffa1nlo,t3_escsj6,1579726085.0,"I got laid off from my office job in 1981, after almost six years of employment. It wasn't a ""mass layoff"", per se, since the company didn't close or anything, but 10 other employees in my department were laid off the same day, as were employees in other departments. I was only 21 years old, this had been my first job, I didn't know anything about unemployment benefits, etc. Anyway, I was instructed to go to the Personnel Dept (this was before it was called Human Resources) and I was given a check for all of my unused vacation days and told that my health insurance would be paid for the next six months. I was given no severance pay.

At that time, collecting a bi-weekly check from Unemployment meant standing in line at the MESC office....a ""fast"" appointment was a wait time of 30 minutes; most times I stood in line with others for up to three hours (luckily I had my Walkman to make the wait a bit more endurable). I went to umpteen job interviews in the meantime, which, as a female in the 1980s, meant donning pantyhose and at the very least a skirt and blouse (sooo uncomfortable during the hot and humid months, especially when your car had no air conditioning). I remember at one interview (after I'd driven 45 minutes to get there) the Personnel director telling me ""You might consider doing something about your hair for future interviews."" (I'd used a curling iron and hairspray on my very fine, straight hair before leaving home, but the hot weather was no match against the hairspray that promised ""hold"" no matter what the atmospheric conditions.)

Anyway, as it turned out one thing in my favor was the [TRA](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/uia_TRAFactSheet102_76398_7.pdf) law that was enacted at the time, so my Unemployment benefits were extended long beyond the traditional 26 weeks.

science,fdl02mc,t1_fdkjtna,1578514660.0,"True enough, but just try and find a Primary Care Physician, much less a specialist, that accepts Healthy Michigan (our state's Medicaid). In my experience, once you *do* find such a doctor, you are treated not only like a third-class citizen, but also as being, well, stupid. For example, when getting approved for Healthy Michigan (via telephone interview), you must listen to a presentation about the food groups and why you must incorporate fresh fruits and vegetables into your diet. And then - I am not making this up - you have to take a quick ""quiz"" afterward to ensure that you understood the benefits of healthy eating. I won't lie - I made the caseworker/whatever the title of the person on the other end of the phone laugh when I told her ""Thank God I was sitting down when I listened to that....did you know that eating fresh vegetables is actually *healthy*?! Knock me over with a feather!""

I get that some Medicaid recipients might need to be educated vis-a-vis healthy foods, but a lot of us are well aware of the four food groups, the Food Guide Pyramid, etc etc, and incorporate produce into our diets as best we can. But that does not cure Lupus or Cancer or MS or other diseases for which we need a doctor's care and regular prescription medicine.

Anyway, back to the doctors who accept Healthy Michigan (Medicaid)....they spend a very minimal amount of time with you (my PCP flat out told me ""We've got 15 minutes, let's not waste time with questions""). The ophthalmologist I saw rushed me through my eye exam and dismissed my question about a field exam - I've been taking Plaquenil daily since 1989, and it can affect the retina - by saying ""Plaquenil concerns have been overstated."" The nearest optometry store that accepted Healthy Michigan when I went to fill my new eyeglass prescription (the ophthalmologist just did exams, he didn't accept Medicaid for ""hardware"") was 45-minute drive from my home. When I showed them my Medicaid card, I was presented with a small tray of frames that were covered by Medicaid.

A French man must have overheard us because he approached us and very enthusiastically told us in halting English: ""No, you can go up! You can go inside! Is allowed!"" He was so sincere that we thanked him and actually walked in the direction of the Eiffel Tower until we were sure he'd left the area. We then scurried back to the train station."
AskReddit,fcv23ya,t1_fcultj4,1577993055.0,"I've only vacationed on the Continent twice in my whole life (been to the UK 17 times, though) and I'll always fondly recall Austria. The subways in Vienna were so clean (I'm talking the tiles in the train stations were glistening white) and the people we encountered were very friendly. (Even in emergency situations; there was this very strange incident on one of the subway platforms....my friend and I arrived to catch a train, and there was a small group of people standing there, surrounding/supporting a man who was bleeding *profusely* from a head wound. I always end up with a huge wad of napkins in my purse because I always stashed unused ones from restaurants to use instead of tissues, etc, so I grabbed and handful of paper napkins and extended them out to one of that crowd. He repeatedly thanked me (""Danke, danke!"") and used them to sop up some of the blood. ""Shouldn't someone call an ambulance?"" I asked aloud. One person replied in halting English ""No, it is OK"". Our train came about that time and my friend and I went on our way, but I still vividly remember Bleeding Head Guy..."

I'm not talking about sympathy cards, but actual gifts of floral arrangements or plants or even food brought to the house. (I've heard of folks contacting the bereaved weeks later just to make sure they'd receive the flowers or whatever. A ""thank you"" note seems to be common courtesy.)"
LifeProTips,fcs5abn,t3_eilqnx,1577911659.0,"Maybe I'm misreading or misunderstanding part of your post...you need a ""friend with benefits"" to compensate for your lack of physical interactions...? Your wife passed away  just a few weeks ago?

In any case, I agree that offering a specific type of assistance is probably appreciated. For example, when my Mother-in-Law passed away, many friends and neighbors brought food (which was much appreciated), but the ""niche"" assistance I found necessary (and provided) was collecting the cards from the floral tributes and helping him write and address a multitude of ""thank you"" cards."
IAmA,fcrur9s,t3_eih87o,1577906882.0,"My Dad got me into DXing when I was a teen. We lived in Metro Detroit, and he recalled that years ago he could pull in WWVA-AM from Wheeling, West Virginia on Saturday nights. (He loved C&W music, and those ""hillbillies"" - his term, not mine - played the best tunes.) He explained to me that cloudy nights were the best time to pull in distant signals because of the signals bouncing off of the cloud cover. 

He had an old Zenith tube-set radio that had a Shortwave band on it, and he and I would often see what stations we could pull in late at night (had to be at night to pull in, say, Europe because of the time difference). I still remember us finding an English-language program broadcast from a station in Amsterdam. It was Father's Day and they were playing a selection of dad-related songs.....and one of them was James Brown's ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"". The DJ said, in his accented English, that he wasn't sure what the title meant, but it had ""Papa"" in it, so it was appropriate."

My Dad was in a Senior Care Facility (euphemisms; they're what's for breakfast) for several months before he passed. My Mom used to visit with other residents after visiting with Dad - Mom is Nature's Talker, and she'll gab with anyone, and also listen to their stories. A lot of the residents didn't have regular visitors, so Mom became their friend. After Dad passed, Mom continued to go once per week to visit her friends, old and new. Mom is 87 now and still visits regularly....but one day last year there was a new person at the reception desk. Mom was leaving after a visit and this person called security because he thought a resident was trying to ""escape"". Luckily the security guards both knew Mom and they all had a good laugh."

Often it's her favorite toy (a ball), which means Hubby drops everything and plays ""fetch"" with her for a few. Sometimes if Mommy hasn't been fastidious in her daily cleaning and all of Zelda's toys are still under the sofa or somewhere else unreachable, she'll bring Daddy a shoe or a rubber door stop or whatever she can quickly find.
