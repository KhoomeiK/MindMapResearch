cats,ffueztn,t1_ffuelas,1580240564.0,She bounces off of it but seems dazed for a second and this happened while on carpet so it’s not like she lost her footing. After the second she just kinda walks of and does something else.
cats,ffuei3o,t1_ffuef9r,1580240271.0,That’s possible
cats,ffuecdh,t1_ffue66g,1580240177.0,"Yeah that’s what I’m worried about but she’s able to play with toys just fine, she loves to play fetch so I’m just kinda at a loss."
Pets,ffsw2sj,t3_euv52a,1580194801.0,"It’s not too long, cats tend to sleep 15-20 hours a day as long as the cat has toys and a scratching post it shouldn’t be a big issue. Now I’m assuming you have at least two days off from work. During those two days and when you get home from work; you should set aside some time to interact with the cat. If your super worried maybe get two? Of course if you get two that means more of everything is needed. If you can financially get two then great if not getting one wouldn’t be absolutely awful."
Pets,ffss30k,t3_euxsbe,1580190427.0,"Give him time cats can be finicky when it comes to new places. Let him only have access to one room for a few days then expand that. Make sure his bowls, liter box and any toys he might have are in that area. Don’t try and force him out unless he’s not getting out from hiding to eat/ drink.

Add on: If possible ask your friend if they can send you a shirt or blanket that has their sent on it to help him get comfortable"

dogs,ffhhp9r,t3_etng9y,1579935721.0,"Doesn’t sound like animal cruelty yeah it sucks for the dog to be in the cage but he’s not physically or mentally harming the dog. If the dogs just chilling in there it’s not that big a deal probably feels comfort being in it

Edit: spelling"
Overwatch,ffhech4,t3_etawwy,1579931778.0,I feel extremely lucky as a female OW player to have have dealt with this that often most of the community is pretty chill to females unlike some other communities in my experience.

dogpictures,ff4gk2j,t1_ff4gb1o,1579563085.0,"Next time you see your doctor ask them to refer you to one so you can work on your autism and grief you’ve been dealing with, now you may not need the therapist for the autism but that could be an easier way to get referred to one. Hope you can find one soon"
dogpictures,ff4fidt,t1_ff4f8ju,1579562375.0,Don’t go to a regular doctor look for a therapist that works with people that are grieving. It might take a few therapists the find the right one for you.
