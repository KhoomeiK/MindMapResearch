I hope she snaps out of it. Unfortunately, she likely won't do so in time. I hope this dude enjoys divorce because that's his future."

cscareerquestions,fcarakz,t1_fcaj8u1,1577575064.0,"Thanks for the response and insight. Your point of view makes sense and it's likely the same point of view as the employers.

First, I've been building my portfolio and projects. After that, I took six JS courses at Frontend Masters as well as two Node courses and a React course. After that, I studied for the technical interviews with Leetcode. I feel pretty good about JS but the courses and interview prep aren't really things to put on the resume.

Second, I've had several jobs out of college, but I didn't want to fill up the resume with irrelevant experience. I'm guessing you didn't mean ""your only job"" in a bad way but it's good to know how someone looking at my resume might perceive it.

In terms of certificates, I've got either 3 or 4 of the certificates from Free Code Camp but I don't see those as valuable. Do you have certificates in mind that actually hold any weight?

Finally, for better or worse, I've made the decision not to attend a bootcamp. At this point, besides the ""resume bump"" I feel that I'm too far in for a bootcamp to be a viable option. If anything, it makes more sense to spend money to attend events or travel to tech hub cities and network. However, I could be wrong here since I haven't been in the position of an employer deciding on whether or not to interview a bootcamp grad.

Edit: Maybe I should focus on drafting cover letters that explain what I've been up to since leaving my last job? Almost all of the applications have just been resume only."
cscareerquestions,fc9vfc0,t3_egnp3r,1577558786.0,"Hey all, here's my resume.

Out of 100 applications, only got 1 coding test and 2 phone screens. With a 3% response rate, I'm sure there's room to improve. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Edit: Updated numbers above"
