NoStupidQuestions,ffwloxb,t3_evm324,1580304880.0,"When you sing higher and lower notes outside your comfort range, you may struggle a bit. Maybe your voice strains, sounds tight, or you can’t nail that breathing technique yet. 

Keep training your voice and you may be able to expand your range a little bit."
educationalgifs,ffwke5z,t3_evmf8w,1580303810.0,"Why not peel the apple and core it regularly? Then slice?

It seems like they removed too much apple. A regular corer doesn’t take as much away."
RoomPorn,ffvt063,t3_ev6t04,1580272392.0,Yeah. It’s beautiful and I would die falling off the top.

BrandNewSentence,ffujsll,t1_ffu4vtg,1580243445.0,"I mean you both are correct-ish though. 

Many, not all, black American people code switch. Speaking a certain way at home or amongst people of the same culture vs among people outside those groups. 

Also, black Americans do have some distinctive and nuanced tones, inflections, timbres, etc to our voices. 

And this is similar to other races/ethnicities. And there’s nothing wrong about that or racist about it. 

I find the nuances of people fascinating. 
I also hate how reddit makes everything all or nothing all the time."

WhatShouldICook,ffsjwta,t3_euuw4r,1580183524.0,"Oh I thought I was on the r/gastritis sub with my people. We must live and die by the ginger. All hail ginger!

We make ginger tea, and put ginger in everything. 

I make a cold and gastritis remedy. Ginger, honey, lemon, turmeric, peppermint tea, apple cider vinegar. Fix a sore throat or a cold right up! Add váyanse if you’re feeling bold. 

A little different than a meal but it may come in handy."

I just ordered him a Toho SFX book, 1989, from Japan. He’s all excited. I guess I’ll be buying a lot of them since there’s one for every movie it seems."
