OldSchoolCool,ffx7au2,t1_ffx6a13,1580319246.0,"No where does it say that the prisoners were put on guard duty, and I don’t think that was something that happened at all. This was most likely a photo opportunity and at worst they gave him the gun to kill the guard. 
The prisoners were usually treated and screened at the camps and not immediately hauled off to hospitals.

You are completely missing that war is more horrific than anyone could imagine and these prisoners saw some of the worst of it and sure it’s easy to sit and judge a photo for not ‘following the rules’ but this was obviously relevant to whatever was going on. If the prisoner was sick, weak, and on the verge of dying he wouldn’t be able to even hold the gun up. 

There’s more to this than ‘right or wrong’ and I’m sure the soldiers could give little to no fucks about protocol. The prisoner is empowered for the first time in god-knows how long and worrying about how a photo looks is the least of any of these people worries."
OldSchoolCool,ffx4ybt,t1_ffww07w,1580317844.0,You are missing a big pierce of the picture; psychological trauma. These guys have had seen unseen horrors so obviously they aren’t thinking about protocols. They probably wouldn’t have given a shit if this prisoner blew a hole in that buys back and he’ll probably would have encouraged it.
OldSchoolCool,ffwvmbx,t1_ffwvcdh,1580312038.0,"Your opinion seems based in logic, however the horrors and nightmares these men (both prisoners and soldiers) witnessed has nothing to do with logic.
