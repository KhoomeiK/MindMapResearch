Dr. Bouer and Dr. Kinter were the ones we usually saw, both were amazing vets (and we've lived in 6 cities and been to dozens of vets over the years). Dr. Olliver is the only one I'd say to try to avoid, and only because if your cat is nervous around new people, she's a little loud and high energy. Great with energetic, friendly dogs though. My husky really liked her."

For the trim stripes and other accent bits, there should be a way to get them off to paint. It would be easier than masking them and painting them on the vehicle.

I was mostly wondering about numbers. If you assume that the scientists' IQs were around 125, and the officers 105, would the grunts (at say 90) be numerous enough to pull the total down below 100. Not that IQ really means anything, but to get something like we'd need to do any sort of mathematical average, it would work well enough."

Hell no. A wheelchair isn't a pass on waiting in line with the rest of us."
nevertellmetheodds,fdgjff4,t1_fdfjbij,1578399246.0,"Yeah, catfish and carp are basically water vultures. If it looks like it might possibly resemble some food-like substance in any way, and it fits in their mouths, they'll eat it."
nevertellmetheodds,fdeuu4s,t1_fdetfab,1578347068.0,"Ok. A kill it and break off pieces thing. I was thinking swallow it whole. (Which is what i meant when i said roughly the same size)

I've seen my chickens swallow a mouse, a snake, and a rather large lizard. (Not at once) The mouse was roughly the size of the chicken's head, btw."
nevertellmetheodds,fden9xu,t1_fdelfal,1578342607.0,"How? They're basically the same size.

I have seen a video of a pelican eating a seagull though."
nevertellmetheodds,fdeizji,t1_fdeh9sw,1578340038.0,That's actually not even a particularly large one.
nevertellmetheodds,fdeiv1h,t1_fde99dc,1578339963.0,Yeah. Everyone knows that curry seagull is the best seagull.
nevertellmetheodds,fdeiqkk,t1_fdegaig,1578339887.0,Fuck Suzan. That lazy bitch just needs to walk her ass around the table.
nevertellmetheodds,fdeidfn,t1_fdea9zq,1578339667.0,"There was a nature show i saw explaining that river carp in Paris have taken to eating pigeons when they go to the edge of the water to bathe.

That's not much different than a tuna eating a seagull."
science,fde3rm8,t1_fddlgor,1578330528.0,"Yes. This incorrect use of 4D bugs the shit out of me.

And for the rest of you, time isn't 4D. It's not a ""dimension"". It's a totally different variable applied to the 3 special ones. Otherwise you could made a 2D object 3D by adding time rather than up."

Alonetv,fddv5j9,t1_fdbr1ea,1578324751.0,"Of course Jordan knew. ""Hey, I'm gonna go try out for that show you won, any advice on how to get through the other 2000 people trying out? And wanna help me make my casting video?""

""Hey, i got called in for final interviews next week."" (Hasn't signed a NDA yet)*Two weeks pass*""Well, how did it go?""""I can't talk about it."" *wink, wink*

*Disappears for 3 months*

""How did you do? You were gone awhile.""""Well, you know i can't say, but let's go buy that expensive sports car I've always wanted."""
Alonetv,fdd0u8k,t1_fdax7ts,1578290360.0,Look through this sub. The trailer was posted this weekend in here.
Alonetv,fdd0sx6,t1_fdakath,1578290320.0,"Yes, any standard NDA includes (not) telling family members, and if he got caught telling his brother, he'd at least lose any winnings, and at most get taken to court for violating a contract.

Jordan knows it's his brother, either because his brother told him... or because his brother told him he couldn't tell him (effectively telling him); and Jordan is letting everyone know in a way that skirts the contract, or it simply resembles his brother: who Jordan isn't great at recognizing, making his post mostly pointless (not likely).

So basically, we just got told Jordan's brother will be in this (in a way where neither Jordan or his brother directly violated any contacts)."
