WTF,fcnmxf3,t1_fcneizd,1577814540.0,"Also, the receiver is the part of a firearm which integrates other components by providing housing for internal action components such as the hammer, bolt or breechblock, firing pin, extractor and trigger mechanism, and has threaded interfaces for attaching (""receiving"") external components. The magazine has a spring which pushes the bullet up into the receiver. Where it is then fired from."
WTF,fcnm5dy,t1_fcneizd,1577814121.0,"The only point I was trying to make was that the receiver is is the most important part of the gun. All the other parts of a gun can be purchased online without background checks and are relatively cheap. but you could print them as well.

And the machine doesn’t have to be cheaper than a single gun. Your assumption is that an individual is the only one who can use it. All it takes is one arms dealer with a low interest loan and a clientele list. A gang or cartel could also purchase one and make receivers that way they would have guns with no serial numbers, which means the firearms can’t be linked to any crimes.  I don’t know if it is profitable at the moment but it wouldn’t be hard to check. Just subtract the loan, interest, and cost of materials and electricity x number of units made from the profit over the given time frame. And you could up sell the untraceable receivers because they are untraceable.

So the real concern is that criminal elements will get their hands on this before the public and the public will have no way to proportionally defend themselves because the cops can’t be everywhere. I wouldn’t carry a gun if I could carry a cop with me everywhere I go.

The most fundamental human right is the right to life and the right to defend your life at all costs.

Rage attacks are inevitable, I would rather have a whole venue armed that way the crazy guy gets capped after two shots instead of a crazy guy getting off 200 shots before the cops show up and kill him. Compare this attack to bar attack a few months back."

So the receiver is the part of the gun that takes the bullet out of the magazine, chambers it and fires the bullet down the barrel. Every other piece of the gun can be purchased without a background check. It is currently illegal to produce your own receiver. So most people don’t openly brag about it. And most of the guys on reddit claim that they turn in the receivers to the police after it breaks or before then. 

Also, I kept using the word “will” in my initial post, emphasis on the future tense because, as you pointed out, 3D metal printers and boring machines are expensive. However in 10-20 years these machines will be much cheaper and likely more prolific. As a result, the governments of the world won’t be able to effectively regulate guns. 

Defense Distributed and other 2A companies are working on making cheap boring machines designed specifically for making receivers."

Most would argue that is a social good to strive towards. And the world is filled with a lot of evil men who wanna ruin that peace.

AskReddit,fcbwc0p,t3_egroo0,1577591690.0,"Last Christmas. 

I work retail in a mall and ever since Thanksgiving my store has been playing the same Christmas playlist, but it is shuffled so there is some “variation”. Well that shit doesn’t work too well because in one shift (5 hours) the song played 23 times. Sometimes back to back.  The store closed at 8pm so we turned the music off and start to clean and fold cloths. 

As we start to fold, outside the door, in the mall, I hear it. A faint... 

“Laaaast Christmas I gave you-“

Suffice to say I lost it. 

And said “If I have to hear that song one more time I am going to blow my fucking brains out.”

The next day I came in and my manager sat me down and asked me if I was feeling alright and if I ever had any dark thoughts to come talk with him about it.

TLDR: heard the song two dozen times at work, said I was gonna kill myself, manager sat me down the next day to talk."
