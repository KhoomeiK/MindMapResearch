Cassandra finally confronting Rapunzel? Awesome.

Another episode ending on a cliffhanger? Not awesome!

This feels less like them building suspense and more like them prolonging the ending."

Not necessarily. A show's rating doesn't determine a character's morals. Rapunzel wouldn't just turn into a killer based on the show's rating."

I suppose not everyone put the pieces together, but come on. They lose Zane and arrive to see tons of people completely covered in ice? Then they fight against magical ice creatures. Then we see an ice-themed emperor holding an ice staff. Come on! lol.
> 
> I'm still say wait out for Nya's Ice.

I don't want her whole ice thing to take over the show, but I feel like more time can be given to it. We had a whole episode about some criminals making a prison break with some 2D animation thrown in. Really? That was a waste of an episode in my opinion.
> 
> They say they took out the dragons to make them less overpowered (and honestly with what people said, maybe it does help)

Ok, yeah. I suppose the dragons would be overpowered. But doesn't Zane have his? Or is that a different dragon?"

Accepting things as they are isn't defeatism. Tulip had to accept that her parent's marriage wasn't always great and that they're divorced. The show didn't have her defying the odds and bringing them back together because it was a happier ending.

> so it's not like it's trying to sell a fantasy that everything will always work out.

That's exactly what the show does though. She didn't have to learn anything to get off the train."
