I remember four years ago I caught an episode of that show ""The Good Wife"" (well, about four minutes of it) which is I guess meant to remind us of Hillary and Bill Clinton, and since it's mostly a propaganda show they were trying to establish that people shouldn't take the results of the Iowa whatever-the-fuck-it's-called seriously, probably since the writers expected Sanders to win and they didn't want people to make much of it if he did. (Yes, it was a fictional episode/show, but those sentiments bleed into real life.) They were talking about how people from Iowa were ""... different"" -- i.e. not likely to reflect the attitudes of normal Americans. It was condescending in the extreme. It was a weak effort, but they may have just been getting their feet wet with that kind of propaganda."

There are a couple of things wrong with your view. First, this isn't humorous at all. It's just an accurate characterisation of many of Trump's supporters. Humour should be detached from mere bandwagoning. The merriment that's associated with feeling like you finally have a position that no one can shake you out of because of how many people are supporting you in it is not the same as humour, and it's dangerous to conflate the two. And it's not merely subjective. Sometimes people report that they found something funny when it was really just a different sort of merriment that they don't know how do differentiate from humour or don't want to admit motivates them.

Secondly, using ""tiny dick jokes"" as a bulwark against criticism is a socially destructive behaviour. You're warning us that anybody who disagrees with you will be associated with having a small penis. Why are you okay with making that more important to people than it ought to be just so that you can feel comfortable that you won't face any criticism, and what makes those jokes funny in the first place?"

People care when they expect other people to care.

If there was no compulsory voting, there'd be no expectation that the person next to you had any interest in politics and it wouldn't be discussed as small talk. But there is. And politics does qualify for small talk apparently, which means that every ignorant piece of shit with eight opinions he received from the news or Facebook thinks it's fair game to spout them all because political discussion is part of the status quo. The thing about Facebook, Reddit, and other such venues is that someone inclined to adjudicate their opinions based on how little resistance they're likely to receive can do just that. They see shitty opinions packaged with hugely inflated confidence and in many cases aggression, and they think that since the person issuing them either doesn't get much criticism and/or succeeds in seeming confident when he does, this is an effective way to deal with the problem of being a complete fucking idiot without taking an enormous hit to the self-esteem.

In many cases, the stupidity of an opinion is a feature, not a bug.
