docker,ffw47y0,t1_ffw3v2x,1580283605.0,No one would call a tractor simulator a “virtual machine” although it is one.  The term “virtual machine” has certain ideas attached to it that might not be applicable to other things that are technically a machine that is virtual.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffw438z,t1_ffuyolh,1580283444.0,"There’s probably a middle ground between “record your crimes in a national database” and “destroy all electronics because they are bugged by the CIA”.  

I’m just making a point.  My doctor knows I smoke weed and it’s fine."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffuvr1f,t1_ffuuas3,1580250260.0,"Ya believe what you want but they do enter it into your record and it is shared between doctors.  

When I go to a new doctor they can look in the computer and see what I told my last doctor."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffuvj7k,t1_ffuu2eb,1580250139.0,Thanks for the advice you just made up.
kittensgame,ffuv8jd,t1_ffulfsl,1580249979.0,"I will play your game.  Post about it here when you’ve got a cut released (or in beta).  This game has changed the way I think about games and even prompted me to learn Unity and begin trying to write an idle game (before I got distracted by learning LED design and hardware programming).

Is any of your ML code for StartCraft or any other games available online?  I’d really love to check it out just for curiosity’s sake.

“Success” is so hard to define in kitten’s game that I can see why it would be challenging to use ML on it.

I almost think it could be more tractable to refactor the code into a set of equations and run optimization algorithms on them.  My intuition says this should be possible but I wouldn’t be surprised if there is some mathematical reason that idea is not applicable."
docker,ffsnhgs,t1_ffq60tf,1580186265.0,"Thanks, I’ll check it out.  Just wanted to throw out the warning because the TCP socket was disabled because it’s too insecure.  I didn’t realize it was even still possible to enable it."
facepalm,ffsndtw,t1_ffptbaz,1580186182.0,Thanks!
kittensgame,ffsnd3b,t1_ffqt5et,1580186165.0,I think it would be super cool to use machine learning or some sort of optimization theory to try to discover optimal strategies that might not occur to human players.  I don’t have the time or experience to realistically make that a reality but it would be very cool nonetheless.
intermittentfasting,ffqnihm,t1_ffpw8ce,1580139243.0,"Thank you, Asian man.  Long days and pleasant nights."
kittensgame,ffqndb9,t1_ffqczva,1580139143.0,"Ah I completely understand, good point.

IMO it doesn’t make sense to play on a PC, only mobile.  If I’m on a PC there are hundreds or thousands of other activities or games I could be doing.  However it’s easy enough to pull out my phone and tap a few upgrades here or there.  Been playing for over a year, maybe two on mobile."
lifehacks,ffpst3l,t3_eubthi,1580104401.0,Any way to do this without throwing away shitloads of plastic all the time?  Or do you wash and reuse the bags?
