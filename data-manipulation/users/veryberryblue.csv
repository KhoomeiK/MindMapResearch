PartyParrot,ffh52uu,t3_eta5ex,1579923337.0,The gracefulness of that take-off and landing...
depression,ffbxj8a,t1_ffbumxc,1579785977.0,"Yeah, I've never known why but for years now, during periods of hightened stress, anxiety and depression, I often have these multiple mini-dreams right before I wake up. They usually involve complex, imaginary problems that I must solve (or else!) and they are always catch-22 or unsolveable. I wake up super stressed, anxious and gloomy and it messes up my mood for most of the day. I hate them so much but am powerless to stop them ):"
depression,ffbrc25,t1_ffbqu6p,1579779687.0,"Your therapist really nailed it because that is exactly what I've been dealing with for a very long time. Just lots of stress and a bunch of different things going on. I'm a really sensitive person so even the little things pile up over time and bother me a lot. I replay various things in my mind over and over again (ie; conversations, outcomes of different things, etc) and it drags me down.

No, I don't really have anyone I can talk to (in depth). Only people who just say things like ""oh, well I hope you feel better"" or stuff like that."
PartyParrot,ffbqvp2,t1_ffalhyn,1579779114.0,Haha...beat me to it (:
depression,ffbqo25,t1_ffbqh2a,1579778838.0,"Sorry. Yeah, it hurts so bad. Even physically."
depression,ffbqllw,t1_ffbqchj,1579778750.0,"Yeah, I think your probably right. I even forgot to feed my beloved pet and felt very guilty about it because I had planned to give it a treat that evening. I've had a pretty good and productive day today and yet ever since a few hours ago, I can sense that feeling of deep depression slowly creeping back up on me again. It always seems to happen that way and then is at it's absolute worst when I wake up."
depression,ffbqcxm,t1_ffbq78u,1579778432.0,"I'm sorry you are going through this too ): . Yeah, it's just a dreadful feeling. Some days...even when I get lots of things done and feel like I'm finally getting somewhere in life, I still wake up feeling aweful. Ugh."
aww,ffazywi,t3_esgxxu,1579748418.0,Beautuful dog and the look on his face is priceless!.

depression,fey35tq,t1_fey1uqf,1579440158.0,"Yeah, this morning was a real doozy for me. Like a flood of thoughts hitting me all at once. Ruined a good part of the morning and put me in a garbage mood ):"
depression,fey2kuk,t1_fexz2el,1579439902.0,"You mean imposing on someone?.

It usually hits me worse when I first wake up but I feel slightly better as the day goes on. I say slightly because right now I have a tooth absess, tons of pain and the antibiotics are tearing up my guts. Plus I have to come up with $$ for my dental appointment and impose on a friend to take me (which I hate doing). But yeah, normally the evenings are better."
depression,fexvksg,t1_fexr0oz,1579437146.0,I'm a night-owl so I can relate so much. Nothing like being up all night and alone with your thoughs while everyone else is asleep. Very lonely and isolating.
depression,fexv3hk,t1_fexo3ck,1579437033.0,"Yeah, it feels wonderful until the nightmares begin or you wake up with racing thoughts and can't get back to sleep. Ugh."
depression,fexuz6j,t1_fexmqvz,1579436946.0,"Also, having to wait for just about anything and waking up with all of the ""what if's"" and anticipatory anxiety/depression about everything that could go wrong."
depression,fex8y9f,t1_fex7y4q,1579427028.0,"Yeah, I was just posting about how blissful I felt when I had surgery years ago and they pumped me full of anesthesia. Out like a light and it was the best feeling I've ever had in my life."
depression,fex8ml7,t1_fex7p1d,1579426893.0,"I remember years ago when I had surgery and they were pumping the anesthesia into my IV line...it was the best feeling I've ever experienced in my life. No problems. No pain. No life stress. No worries. Peaceful bliss.

Then I woke up ):"
depression,fex6hd7,t1_fex63w0,1579425327.0,"Yeah, it's like you know you have things you need to do but your brain and body just shut down...almost like a self-defense mechanism. Then, you just roll over, go back to sleep and when you finally wake up again it's like 3:00 in the afternoon."
depression,fex3tde,t1_fex2zrv,1579423837.0,"You know, sometimes I feel like some of the dark thoughts ocurr during sleep so I'm not sure if I'm ""thinking"" in my sleep or just having a bunch of thought-like dreams. Like this morning I had about 5-6 super-gloomy thoughts but then woke up so I guess maybe I was dreaming these thoughts. Also, some of them didn't seem to make any sense at all. I woke up and was really affected by them for most of the day. It makes it so hard to get up and get moving and just destroys my motivation to do anything. Ugh."
depression,feww57d,t1_fewuw1q,1579420417.0,"Yeah, mental exhaustion can be worse than physical exhaustion. Your brain just wants to shut down so it doesn't have to deal with all the modern day stressors that life thrusts upon us each day. Life can be overly complex on so many different levels and just thinking about it can wear you out sometimes so it's easier just to roll over and go back to sleep."
depression,fewv8kq,t1_fews0ls,1579420016.0,"Yeah, I have feelings like that myself. Every day feels like the one before it and I feel like whats the point of doing anything because it's always the same each day."

depression,fewksgh,t1_fewj8cp,1579412936.0,"Yeah, sometimes you can't even escape the dark, gloomy thoughts during sleep because then, they just invade your dreams."

depression,fewh0fm,t1_fewetsc,1579410437.0,"What kind of gloomy or racing thoughts make you just turn over and go back to sleep (if you feel comforatble to share)?. For me it's the life I'm stuck in at the moment (health issues, caring for a friend who also has health problems as well as a pet with health problems, no transportation, bills that need to be paid, having to impose on other people, etc)."
depression,few5s63,t1_feuo8h2,1579405798.0,"I hear you!. Yeah, I feel like giving up just about every morning. So tired (literally) of feeling so gloomy, hopeless and doomed."
depression,few58cp,t1_feuq7my,1579405575.0,"Wow, we must be twinzies!. Yeah, unexpected things are a big one for me (or having to wait for/anticipate something). Also, I over-analyze every conversation and at the end, feel like I've said something horrible and offended someone. A lot of the really negative emotions seem to hit me hard when I first wake up. Like right now, I'm obsessing over a dental appointment, feeling like I acted wierd around a friend of mine and feeling guilty about imposing on someone. Ugh."

depression,fdtqs9y,t1_fdtptg1,1578720749.0,"No, never heard of the apple juice one but it's definitely worth a try. Over the years, I've had all kinds of strange experiences at night (ie; exploding head syndrome, sleep paralysis, hypnopompic/gogic hallucinations, etc). Nighttime can be very wierd. Ugh."
depression,fdtpjxc,t1_fdtoc1n,1578720214.0,"Yeah, to be honest, I'm kind of afraid to go to sleep again because I don't know what to expect. The insane asylum one last night was the worst. There was actually a lot more to it than what I typed. Like I tried to escape through an AC vent in the wall and got cornered in another room by a kind and understanding doctor who gave me an ativan. Several of the rooms had various activities where patients were playing board games, painting, doing arts and crafts and even dancing under a disco ball. There was even a dining room and kitchen where people were eating. Lots of people. So wierd!."
depression,fdto4lc,t1_fdtnmz9,1578719601.0,"You know, I've heard of that a few times. It's some kind of alpha/beta blocker isn't it?. Anyway, glad your getting relief from it (:"
depression,fdtk1cf,t1_fdti0it,1578717878.0,"Thanks. Yeah, what really gets me is that the stress and anxiety caused by these nightmares can sometimes last throughout the day, even after the dream itself has long since been forgotten. I guess the cortisol and adrenalin take awhile to flush out of your system or something like that."

ShiptShoppers,fdmxy8i,t1_fdm0w3x,1578570758.0,Thanks for your reply. Everything seems to have worked out fine.

ShiptShoppers,fdm1rm4,t1_fdm1iom,1578537753.0,That makes sense. I'm kind of hoping for a 50% off membership fee at some point. Not sure if they are doing that though or if something like that will be offered in the future.
ShiptShoppers,fdm1364,t1_fdm0tv1,1578537296.0,"Thank you. Yes, 2 customer accounts at the same address in order to share the cost. Why would it be better to split the cost of a single account?."
