interestingasfuck,fg0hh7s,t1_fg08ew2,1580407893.0,"I find this similar to dogs ""smiling."" Showing teeth does not mean the same thing to humans as it does dogs, and it's always weird to see people on the internet saying ""he's so happy."""
interestingasfuck,fg0hcoh,t1_fg0eb53,1580407818.0,"You'll notice i put more nuance into my post than you give me credit for, which I would argue is disingenuous. I'm not saying dogs don't ""feel"" things. They just don't have emotions the way we do. They respond to things the way a dog does, which generally tend to follow guidelines based on dog evolution. When you punish a dog for tearing up a cushion hours earlier, the dog does not feel shame, because the dog doesn't have the capacity to understand that they're being punished for something they did much earlier. Like the guy said above, it's reacting to a pack mentality that ""pack leader is mad, I must show submission.""

If you project human emotions onto an animal, you're both gonna have a bad time. If you think your dog ""hates"" you because it's acting out, or that it does things out of spite, you are not properly taking care of the dog. If you think your cat is pooping outside the litter box or tearing up your couch because of ""emotion,"" then you're ignoring why the cat is likely miserable."
interestingasfuck,fg0bqn4,t1_fg09lzo,1580404448.0,"Yep, people do the same shit with cats. My cat must HATE me because it scratched or bit me. It couldn't be because of a behavior problem, it must be because he hates me! Cats and dogs don't have emotions (at least not a human way), they have complex behaviors that human beings believe are feelings. Dogs literally can't feel shame the way a human can, but we'll keep telling ourselves they do because we can't believe that they're just animals. Great animals, cute animals, but without an evolved frontal cortex that gets them anywhere near complex emotions like ours. 

When you punish an animal for something they did earlier in the day, they don't even connect what they did to the punishment, so how could they feel shame?

While typing this, i realized that this is apparently something that also bothers me."
iamverysmart,fg0adw2,t1_fg02yip,1580403632.0,Yep. I remember doing some stupid presentation. I was just wondering how it was a reward to have to skip recess.
iamverysmart,ffzyzxd,t1_ffzu59b,1580396457.0,I got kicked out of gifted classes because I wanted to go to recess instead. It was a waste of time for someone like me. As in a person who didn’t have study skills and needed to expend energy more than he needed to sit around and watch people outside playing.

aww,ffvtjgl,t1_ffvt5mp,1580272833.0,Didn’t bother to downvote you. And of course your dogs smells like a dog. They all do. But I can’t say I’ve ever had litter in my bed.
aww,ffvsk43,t1_ffvinh8,1580272036.0,Lol. Cats smells significantly better than dogs. And dogs can be much louder. And that’s coming from a guy who loves both.
aww,ffv3isp,t1_ffv357t,1580254830.0,That bastard. He’s just perfectly ok with torturing his humans.
aww,ffv3gnx,t1_ffv2xlc,1580254791.0,"Yeah, the best way to fix that is to not reward the bad behavior when it’s happening. Don’t do nice things to get them to stop bad behavior. Just ignore them until they’ve stopped making noise. Though that’s much easier said than done, especially with an adorable kitten."
aww,ffuzrcg,t1_ffuriox,1580252476.0,"The purring is just because it's a kitten. Purrs USUALLY get quieter as they get older and put on some weight, but that's not always the case. But yeah, the little yelps are (probably) because it was so young when they found it and is being needy. Very cute neediness though. Might grow up to be as annoying as my cats though. The yelling at you is much cuter when it's little squeaks. When they get older and are still yelling at you for food, it can be a not so fun way to get woken up."
aww,ffuzgdh,t1_ffuqwq5,1580252303.0,"In my experience, kittens generally have purrs that sound like a running motor. As they put on more weight, there's more sound insulation."

UpliftingNews,ffqipdb,t1_ffpxksy,1580135697.0,"They were both starving, full of worms and wandering outside near a busy road. One looked like he was 4 weeks old and he was actually 6 weeks. If someone owned those kittens, they didn’t deserve them.

Edit: also, if you let your cat outside without a collar or microchip, then don’t be surprised when that cat ends up somewhere else."
UpliftingNews,ffplgg2,t1_ffpla7o,1580097971.0,"I might steal their adult cat and do a neuter and return.

Edit: spay and return, in this case."
UpliftingNews,ffple51,t1_ffpjfmy,1580097922.0,"Wow, I read that as ‘pound’ at first and now I’m pissed off. It’s not the 1800s. You don’t have to put them in a sack and throw them in a river like there isn’t a fucking infrastructure for this sort of thing. 

And both of my cats actually came from the streets. one wandered up to my ex at a bike store and I gave him the wildly unpopular name Schwinn."
UpliftingNews,ffpfu2s,t1_ffo8pno,1580093999.0,Why don’t people just abandon them on a random doorstep or just google the nearest humane society sort of place? Kittens always get adopted unless they’re super sick or something.
politics,ffpcdp5,t1_ffoihrt,1580091530.0,"This is actually a problem most media have had for a while. Especially since trump came into office AND especially because NPR tries to stay objective and calm in a period of serious misinformation on a scale that we haven’t seen here before. How do you call someone a liar when they refuse to tell the truth, without looking like you’re taking a side? It’s something they haven’t figured out yet, and desperately need to. 

You either go along with it, or at least don’t call it out directly, and get called soft or a shill, or you can really hammer them and get called a ‘shill working for the Democrat party’. I don’t know what the answer is, but a lot of smart, caring people are trying hard to figure it out.

Edit: Jim Lehrer talked about this recently before he died. Thought it was interesting."
AbruptChaos,ffiimhm,t1_ffih1os,1579974757.0,"Nah, I don’t believe so. It’s still there, so that’s something. They can end up in trees if they get caught in strong enough winds. But it’s possible he coincidentally saved himself by not being in the house, though he’d be the exception to the rule in that regard. You’re nearly always safer in an interior room in your house than outside."
AbruptChaos,ffiejb7,t1_ffie5yx,1579971973.0,"I mean, if the house and garage were both blown away down to the foundation and the car is still repairable for the insurance, that’s seriously the most amazing thing I’ll have ever seen. Stuff like that does occasionally happen, but seeing the car blown around really doesn’t make me optimistic in that regard."
AbruptChaos,ffie7lr,t1_ffie18h,1579971752.0,"Scuffed isn’t the right word. The tornado took out his house and garage, which means it was powerful. There are debris bullets flying through the air. My parents’ cars looked like they had been shot up with an assault rifle after a direct hit. I guess it’s possible it’s not, but that would be some sort of act of god in itself."
AbruptChaos,ffie2xh,t1_ffidqsh,1579971667.0,"You ever seen the aftermath of a tornado? Cars just don’t survive direct hits. Too much debris. It may still be drivable but as far as insurance goes, there’s almost no chance it’s not totaled."
AbruptChaos,ffidako,t1_ffi9s3q,1579971138.0,"Yep. A tornado is a gun and your car is basically paper.

Also, since I haven’t found a good reason to tell this story, in 2014, I think, my parents’ house got hit by a tornado. It was built I to the side of a hill, so it was intact, though they had to rebuild. But when we went the next day to start getting stuff out of the house, there was a lamp in the corner. It was still standing up, but the cord was inside the wall. The tornado picked up the second floor of the house, and set it back down, and the lamp’s cord was inside. That’s when it really hits you what kind of power you’re dealing with."
AbruptChaos,fficud0,t1_ffi3nud,1579970834.0,"That could be the case if it wasn’t a direct hit and the garage was sturdier, but that car would’ve been totaled either way. Because that vehicle is definitely totaled even if it didn’t get swept away. Debris flying around in the air acts like little bullets."
AbruptChaos,fficofi,t1_ffi5beb,1579970721.0,"His vehicle is 100 fully totaled. The pieces of crap flying around in the air have likely scratched the pain, put dents in it and based on how strong the tornado, it can even punch shit through the metal like bullets. Tornadoes are insane."
AbruptChaos,fficjwh,t1_ffi9oop,1579970633.0,"Dude’s obviously never seen tornado damage in real life. Though most Americans haven’t either. This house wasn’t exactly super sturdy but I’ve seen very sturdy houses be totally obliterated. It’s not something most houses, even well built ones, can withstand. Tornados are pretty hard to fathom if you haven’t seen the damage firsthand."

Especially since the patriots are going to have a really tough time this year. I’m just saying that you shouldn’t take some dumbass saying we can’t win as the general sense of the sub. Most people on here are pretty cool. Until we actually lose a few games, and they get pretty negative. But I promise you, that’s every sub for every team ever. We are not special in that regard. I’m a fan of some real shit teams (Arkansas Razorbacks, anyone?) and that shit gets pretty goddamn negative. As saints fans, we just have the  privilege of being good right now, and when Brees retires and Peyton probably goes to coach Dallas, we’ll know who really sticks with us.

Edit: just to be clear, I agree that the other dude is an asshat. I just think that largely the sub is good. I really just believe that people who can take a punch should contribute more when the chips are down, because we all take a day off because we’re bummed and let the shitheads take over the sub.
