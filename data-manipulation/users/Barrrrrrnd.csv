todayilearned,ffca473,t1_ffc813a,1579794989.0,Oh yeah I wasn’t even thinking of submarine launched middles!  Those are another engineering marvel all on their own.
todayilearned,ffc5b1a,t1_ffc4x31,1579791868.0,"I suppose.  We are both saying the same thing in different ways.  Sound creating vibration failures that result in catastrophic damage = shake the vehicle apart to a layman.

I read a thing once - I can’t remember where - that was a hypothetical for the Saturn V about what would happen if the hold down bolts didn’t fire and release the vehicle and the engines kept running.  If I remember correctly they said the vehicle would have lasted less than 15 second before it failed because of said “acoustic loding”.

Interesting stuff. I see where you are coming from with your way of looking at it, for sure."
todayilearned,ffc4ln4,t1_ffc43mq,1579791392.0,"True, though I’ve read several articles and engineering studies that showed that if the acoustic reflections and shockwaves weren’t attenuated that the damage to the vehicle would have been catastrophic and resulted in loss of the vehicle.  This is especially true of the Saturn V and the Space Shuttle.  It’s way too early in the morning for me to go hunt them down but you sound like you know how to look that stuff up.

There is an excellent video floating around out there if a Saturn V night launch and you can see the shockwaves from the exhaust reflecting off the ground and bouncing all over the place. If you can find it is a pretty awesome display of the power of the sound that monstrosity is putting out while it’s still on the pad."
todayilearned,ffc3scr,t1_ffc17rw,1579790832.0,"From What I understand they diver the exhaust away from the vehicle and vent it out somewhere else. If you make the sound referent somewhere else than the vehicle it’s mostly as
Effective as using water to block the reflections from the flat land under a human rated vehicle."
