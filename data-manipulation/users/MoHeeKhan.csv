AskReddit,fexcieh,t1_fex9tgn,1579428644.0,"That’s a great answer, thanks very much.

When I wrote the question I was thinking about Anne Sacoolas receiving diplomatic immunity from the US after killing a British citizen. She fled the country after giving assurances to police she would remain for the investigation, and the US are not due to waive immunity and grant extradition.

Considering the similarity of laws and penalties concerning the crime, would you say that it’s correct that it remained that way, and that the US should not waive immunity for a relative of a diplomat?"

The only bit of hope anyone can see coming out of that shitheap right now is Sanders, because he genuinely wants to drag the US kicking and screaming into line with everyone else where government is run on the will of the people instead of how much money private companies can give it, where the police are not a militia of barbaric thugs and where people’s kindness extends beyond family and friends to strangers resulting in not baulking in abject rage when someone suggests that paying a bit more in taxes means you won’t go bankrupt and homeless when a family member gets cancer.

Vote for Bernie Sanders.

AmItheAsshole,feagh62,t3_eo9ue5,1578948460.0,"NTA. A lot of people these days seem to assume that if you apologise for something, the other side is under a forced obligation to forgive and forget, and if they don’t then they’re awful and the person who apologised is totally vindicated. I think it stems from it being so incredibly hard for people to admit they’re wrong these days and just say sorry sincerely, everyone would rather double down or completely ignore the facts and the issue, destroy or end friendships because they cannot be wrong.

You are under no obligation to forgive anyone. They might have genuinely apologised and be trying to repair the relationship but that doesn’t mean any feelings of resentment or negativity about what happened are wrong, and you’re not a bad person because they didn’t instantly melt away when she said sorry. You’re perfectly within your right to listen to the apology, understand it and then carry on not being friendly with them anymore."
