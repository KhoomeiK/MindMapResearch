Frugal,ffg15j4,t3_etfmkb,1579896209.0,I use my keurig for hot water more than anything. Works great for oatmeal as well as ramen and tea
FinancialPlanning,ffg06vc,t3_etfbbc,1579895621.0,"Pay them off right away, you want to pay as little interest as possible. It will make your credit utilization score lower and increase your credit rating. There's no downside that I am aware of to paying off credit card debt as much as possible.

When applying for a new credit card it will decrease your score a bit but will go back up to what it was within a few months as long as your are paying off the balance."
ps2,ffb9p1d,t3_esogrx,1579756419.0,The Tekken games are all great as well as virtua fighter 5 and Soul Caliber 2 & 3
financial,ffaydy3,t1_ffas4uo,1579747359.0,"Actually, your debt load does play a factor but not nearly as much as on-time payments"
mbti,ff7aigd,t1_ff6n400,1579644663.0,I agree. I'm economically right leaning and definitely more libertarian than authoritarian. I am socially left though but that's not reflected on the chart.
financial,fep6gu4,t3_eq9p6v,1579313207.0,"Keep it in the matching work program. It's free money. If the growth rate is low, you should be able to change what mutual finds it's invested in. If you let them choose the default, It'll put you mostly in bonds and low risk stocks to play it safe. That may be why it is not growing as quick as you expect."
nfl,fep5xud,t1_fep2biw,1579312861.0,You should throw down a big bet if you're that sure about it
financial,fenh3n3,t3_eq0rib,1579284553.0,"When I had to start doing taxes, my parents sat down with me and told me what to do but made me do it all. This helped me learn a lot. I started off just doing the 1040EZ from when I didn't have much to report but then switched to TurboTax. Now, my wife and I have been filing on TurboTax for about 10 years and it makes it really easy."
playstation,fegyopm,t3_ep0nn2,1579105467.0,"I only had 262 hours, so less than an hour a day on average but I probably have about the same amount of hours on PC so only like an hour and a half per day. I could not imagine playing games 12 hours a day"

crtgaming,fdkas7y,t3_elq3bf,1578499924.0,I have the same TV and I love it. So glad it came with the stand too
crtgaming,fdimvxj,t3_eljgvo,1578446460.0,"I paid $20 for a 36"" Sony Trinitron w/ stand. People are practically giving away CRT's these days."
detroitlions,fdi334b,t3_elg6jp,1578434859.0,"What if they create this huge smokescreen that we want Tua really bad, so then we trade up with the Redskins one spot to get him, but then we surprise pick Chase Young out from under them."

BackyardPork,fdcffwk,t1_fdcfarw,1578273581.0,And any one that knows any thing about training animals is that you don't punish them when they return. That does the exact opposite of what you intend it to do
BackyardPork,fdcekac,t1_fdcdomx,1578272972.0,That second paragraph is the stupidest thing I've heard in my life. In no universe will that training method work and it will do the exact opposite of what you intend for it to do
MagicArena,fd03011,t1_fczx2cc,1578112879.0,I love that you have that username and you made that comment
MagicArena,fd02h3l,t1_fczz9k6,1578112663.0,"I meant that Nantuko Shade was good because the meta supported mono black with much better support, not because the meta was weak. The meta was actually pretty strong at the time. Mono black was strong even with UG madness and Tog in the meta."
MagicArena,fczxuib,t1_fczx4p2,1578110487.0,Obvious point is obvious
MagicArena,fczv2ni,t3_ejqqn5,1578109108.0,Sounds like some one who never played Nantuko Shade in standard. Dread shade would've been better if mono black got better support but it didn't. We got a card that's almost as good as Cabal Coffers but not much else.
howto,fcztf8f,t1_fczsqrt,1578108303.0,Never said that
howto,fczrxhp,t1_fczpkgu,1578107593.0,I know in Colorado you don't need dependents and I assumed he was a citizen since he moved here. He can always apply and see if he's approved.

gamecollecting,fcuczzv,t3_eiyhe8,1577978078.0,I recently picked up an OG Xbox and am having a blast. It has the superior versions of a vast majority of the multiplatform titled of that gen. PS2 had my favorite exclusives of that gen but 99% of them have HD remakes now so I tend to play those instead
fo4,fcu9377,t3_eiyt72,1577975471.0,I have no idea who Fudgemuppet is
Fallout,fcpnk3k,t3_eig4rl,1577868155.0,Yes. Much better. Fallout series has better performance on xbox or PC.
howto,fcawogq,t1_fcaw3vc,1577578096.0,First stop talking like that. It makes you sound super creepy. Woman are not be entrapped. Find interesting activities to go out and do where there are women. Find a common interest and do that together.
istp,fcaw6cq,t3_egybf9,1577577806.0,Sure hope this was reported to law enforcement
pcgaming,fcac4ny,t1_fcaagkj,1577566538.0,"That's interesting because I would say I finished a higher percentage of games when I was younger because I couldn't afford to buy new games. I tried as hard as I could to finish every game I had but of course in that day many games were just too difficult for many people to beat. I'm talking NES, SNES, and genesis mainly"
nfl,fca7g2j,t1_fca6rm5,1577564191.0,Came in to say this. Justin Simmons and Kareem Jackson too
pcgaming,fca78kr,t1_fca6da7,1577564096.0,This. It's the exact opposite problem as when you're a kid gamer.
FinalFantasy,fc973hv,t3_egr9i8,1577548080.0,I think the trophies/achievements are fun to go after so I prefer it on ps4 or xbox. 2 great games either way though
