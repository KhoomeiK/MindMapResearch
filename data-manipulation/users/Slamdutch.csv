RocketLeague,ffi3rgd,t1_ffi1av3,1579964232.0,Well I don’t know if Psyonix has a way of tracking how many micro transactions each and every player has made since the game came out. Expecting refunds for every micropurchase is a little silly. If Costco closes I don’t get my membership and all of my groceries refunded.
RocketLeague,ffi3jx6,t3_etljph,1579964057.0,"Blueprints aren’t all that bad and are infinitely better than loot crates. They just need either a trade-in system or the ability to get credits through playing. And the macOS/Linux thing honestly is blown of out proportion. Less than 1% of the playerbase, and they still have ways of playing via boot camp etc., and it allows them to update the skeleton of the game out of the Stone Age. 

It’s ufortunate that it’s just another negative headline, but honestly I think it’s good for the future of the game."

RocketLeague,feqhkkw,t1_feqehts,1579342021.0,"What has changed since Epic obtaining RL? They pissed off the entire fan base with a poorly implemented item store with jacked up prices, dropped a broken update right before the biggest LAN of the year, which was held in a country where most of the playerbase doesn’t speak the language at a shit venue, they still don’t allow other parties to have big tournaments, they fired another one of the best and most beloved analysts for no reason, and they still haven’t given any quality of life improvements this game has needed and people have been asking for for years now. They don’t give enough incentives for new orgs and they haven’t updated the esports shop in a long time. They made a fantastic game with a ton of potential, but they do not do nearly enough to capitalize and grow the scene. So many little things that would be incredibly easy to implement haven’t been addressed after 4 years, and there’s no reason to believe they will be.

Edit: AND it’s been announced they’re pulling the game from the steam store, the biggest and most well established online gaming store out there."

todayilearned,feowdtk,t1_fenrney,1579306837.0,"Hi. I have schizophrenia so I feel somewhat qualified to answer this. The answer is it depends. Being aware of your own mental illness and being able to distinguish its affects from reality is called “insight” and levels of it vary widely from person to person and disorder to disorder.

Some people, probably the majority, don’t have very little to no insight and believe they are healthy and what they perceive as reality is true. But some people are able to recognize when they are having psychotic episodes or becoming manic, etc. So generally yes, “insane” people don’t know they are out of reality, but it’s not a 100% of the time thing."

We’ll never get another Mac Miller album. We’ll probably get another Eminem album in two or three years complaining about all the same stuff. This Eminem album in the grand scheme of music really isn’t that important. Mac’s is. 

Like I said, I’m a huge Eminem fan. He got me j to hip hop, I’ve listened to him my whole life and I have all his albums. But it is a little disappointing that he didn’t have the respect or the ability to humble himself and realize his album is not where attention needed to be today."

RocketLeagueEsports,fcku9bn,t1_fckqvyx,1577733317.0,">If you really wanted a certain item you could trade it with the community for a certain value.

You can still do that. The prices have moved around but trading is still a thing. 

>Blueprints are worse because they removed that random chance of getting what you wanted for a very low price, forcing us to use what is pretty much the same as the player-to-player trading market, except with worse prices and the currency goes to Psyonix/Epic instead of players.

Getting rid of gambling is a good thing. Money from keys went to psyonix too just like credits. You can trade credits just the same. 

>You have to be a complete idiot to go and actually spend that many keys instead of trading it with the community, cause it'll for certain be cheaper than 400 keys. 

Except some people *do* do that because this game has a young, impressionable audience and gambling is a toxic addictive disease.

99.9% of people who got painted BMs from crates DIDN'T sit one day and decided to spend hundreds of keys until they got a specific BM of a specific color. Most people got it by sheer luck.

Except plenty of people did. RL you tubers and streamers held crate openings where they opened hundreds of crates at a time, and more players did the same. If you have people willing to pay a thousand dollars for alpha boost people aren’t going to have a problem opening large amounts of loot boxes. 


>So basically, before blueprints if you wanted a certain item you had to be lucky (via gambling) or rich (via trading) to get it. 

How is that more fun?

>Now you have to either be rich (by crafting the blueprint or by buying from the store) or be lucky AND rich (by getting a blueprint of a specific item of a specific color AND crafting said blueprint).

Except the items that people actually want are almost universally cheaper and are fixed at a maximum of like 25 dollars. And you can still trade blueprints from drops and credits just like you could crates and keys. The only difference is now you can’t get credits after games like you could with keys. If they changed that then all of the outrage goes away. At the end of the day, trading is not the main part of the game. Having gambling in a video game was going to hold it back in many countries’ markets and dissuade people from accepting it. (And you can just use alpha console or bakkesmod so you could get anything you want for free anyway.)"
