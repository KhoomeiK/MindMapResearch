This made me actually break down in tears. This woman was tortured for hours. People heard her screams and witnessed her being flung into the trunk of his car in more than one location. Video and pictures of the torture were disseminated to this pathetic loser’s pathetic friends. And they didn’t call police. They didn’t jump in their car to find and rescue her. She was left to her unimaginable suffering. She must have felt so helpless, so abandoned by the world. It’s hard to accept that this still happens, but this is the fate of so many women around the world. Brutalized by insecure macho men who can’t accept female autonomy. Who are so threatened by any demonstration of female power and independence. She wanted to leave him and he would rather she was dead than she assert her power to leave. 

He murdered her. This was first degree murder and torture. And that’s what he should be charged and convicted of. Every person who had an opportunity to help, specifically those who received pictures and video and did nothing, should be prosecuted."

https://m.huffingtonpost.com.au/2016/07/21/we-found-out-if-you-can-actually-shrink-your-stomach-through-d_a_21436038/

Even in extreme cases of morbid obesity it appears that capacity is altered, not size. However, regular over-consumption and stretching does appear to damage the anatomy of the stomach and it’s ability to signal fullness, even after weight loss. This study suggests that once damaged, these changes may be permanent and may explain why obese people are generally unable to keep the weight off.

horror,fdjf9dq,t1_fdjehak,1578468316.0,"Horror evokes prolonged fear and dread, regardless of how or why. Psychological horror and slashers are sub genres that fall under the “horror” umbrella. Sci fi horror, like Alien or the Thing, are not technically supernatural, but they are horror. 

Supernatural horror is a sub-genre of horror. Which is why it needs a name distinguishing it from the other sub-genres. 

Just because you don’t find “possible” horror to be scary personally doesn’t mean it’s not horror. I’d agree that it’s not as scary in general, which is why I prefer supernatural horror. Some non-supernatural horror movies: Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Saw, The Devils Rejects, Jacob’s Ladder, Alien, Life, Funny Games... even zombie horror movies aren’t considered supernatural because they exist in a fictional universe where zombies are a natural, if novel, phenomenon.

fatlogic,fdj8rht,t3_elhicv,1578461714.0,"Don’t these people get that the concept of “restriction” is as arbitrary as they say calorie requirements are? 

Technically, I have access to almost unlimited calories every day. Even if I stay home all day, I technically have access to hundreds of thousands of calories which I could technically eat. Every time I don’t do that, I’m restricting my calories. I can restrict my calories to 3000 per day or more, like many FA and HAES advocates do, or I can restrict to a reasonable number that satisfies me and doesn’t make me fat, which for me is somewhere around 1600 to 2000. 

Avoiding restriction altogether is the definition of gluttony. Restriction is good. Restriction is about discipline, sobriety, and being mindful and conscientious of my impact in myself and the world. I restrict how much I spend, how much I drink, how much I drive my car, etc etc. restricting my calorie intake absolutely makes me a better person. If you truly aren’t restricting yourself at ALL, you are an addict and you’re sick, or you’re living with food insecurity/starvation. Anyone with access to the standard American diet is restricting to some extent, or is one of the lucky ones who doesn’t need to restrict due to low appetite"

As opposed to I spit on your grave, where you see almost everything and the attack is drawn out from the unbelief of what’s going to happen, to the pleading and reasoning phase, to the shame and exposure, to bargaining to spare yourself certain acts (take this, don’t take that, do this but don’t do that) to the end when everything was done, nothing was left and she barely cared if she died... that scene is just about unbearable."

DeadBedrooms,fdc6fa4,t1_fdc5pul,1578268014.0,"No, it doesn’t. It’s not a perfect transaction. It’s the compromise.

Of course, this only works if both parties are making a genuine effort. If the LL feels no reason to ever have sex again, well, it’s not gonna work. But in this situation, she obviously is.

DeadBedrooms,fdbnxwk,t3_ekdnak,1578259265.0,"It sounds like she’s making a genuine effort, you had great sex the first might which from context it seems is a big improvement for you two. But when she’s not in the mood, you weren’t understanding. She was probably enjoying the closeness, the intimacy of being with you by a fire. She probably felt pretty rejected, like the progress she’d made doesn’t mean anything if she’s not in the mood at any point. 

I bet that if you had been understanding, held her close, talked to her, expressed your love non-sexually at that moment, you would have found yourself having sex a whole lot more that trip. 

It sounds crass, but in this kind of situation, where the LL is making an effort, it’s almost a quid pro quo type deal. When you have sex, shr earns your gratitude and future understanding when she says no, and when she rebuffs and you respond with compassion and love, you earn sexual intimacy in the future. It sounds weird, but when libido is mismatched, this kind of exchange can result in more regular sex, and better relations in general. That is, so long as no ones “keeping score” in too literal a way. 

I’m not saying it’s all your fault, but I do think you would have experienced a better outcome if you had accepted her non sexual intimacy in that moment and savored the fact that you did have great sex earlier."

fatlogic,fd3km6g,t1_fcypy5i,1578159171.0,"“Diabetes is a social construct” oh good lord. If this is the kind of thing that website is spouting, they are assuredly the worst of the worst of a fundamentally flawed movement. I agree that encouraging people who are already at risk to ignore their doctors advice and eat themselves as fat as they want because “set points” is tantamount to violence against another. I equate that to pro-ana garbage. This is the dark side to the FA movement, and it’s the dogmatic aspect they need to denounce and eradicate if they want to be taken seriously and gain traction. 

we are agreeing that losing weight is technically possible for almost everyone, which means that not attempting weight loss, or giving up on weight loss, is a choice. But if we’r saying it’s a VALID and morally neutral choice, we’r also saying that for some people, continued weight loss attempts harm quality of life more than temporary weight loss (which is what they’ve all experienced over and over) helps it, at least in their opinion. If we agree on these things, we also have to agree that obesity isn’t going anywhere anytime soon and the FA movement is probably right about society needing to accommodate larger bodies (larger sturdier seating, bigger seats on airplanes in particular, larger sizes available in regular retail stores, accommodations for the mobility challenged, and most importantly fixing medical bias), not to mention the moral obligation to stop treating fat people as problems needing to be fixed, or assuming that weight loss is always the right solution for all fat people. The problem is, can we do these things without denying the scientific fact that obesity makes people sick and shortens their lives? How can we accept fat people as they are, which is a moral imperative, without encouraging the spread of a painful and harmful disease? I don’t have the answers, but I don’t think the solution is to exalt Tess Holliday, a morbidly obese, narcissistic bully, on the cover of Cosmo JUST for being fat. If Tess Holliday were doing something important and just happened to be very fat, then sure. But all she is is a very fat model, which means putting her on Cosmo has no purpose but glorification of her body, which is objectively an unwell body. 

I’m getting off topic. I don’t think we’r going to agree on thin privilege. I don’t believe privilege is something you need to be born with. If you are born in a trailer park, you are not born with class privilege. But, if you are adopted by a very wealthy family family at a young age, you inherit class privilege. If you go from fat to thin, you inherit thin privilege. If you go back to being fat, you shed the privilege. IMO, having privilege doesn’t negate your accomplishment, or devalue what you did. Its another flaw of the FA movement that they demonize people for their privilege. It’s an unjust system that treats some people better than others based on all kinds of factors, but it’s not the fault of the individuals. Privilege is desirable for those that don’t have it. It’s a big reason people lose weight- to take advantage of thin privilege and beauty ideals (in addition to obvious health benefits) and enjoy a better life in this society, and who could blame them for that? 

It’s interesting, I just watched a YouTube video by a girl who lost 150 lb on keto. She’s pretty popular but I forget her name. Anyway, she was listing ways her life has changed since losing. I decided to make a point to keep track of the changes that were due to gaining privilege, and which were health consequences. The vast majority were the result of gaining privilege, things like “I don’t feel embarrassed to go out in social situations”, “men offer to assist me with physical tasks”, “I’m not afraid I won’t fit in seats and chairs”, “I’m not afraid to eat what I want in front of people”, “I don’t shy away from the camera for photos”, “I can find my size in any store”. The most damning was this: “people are nicer to me. Their attitude towards me is more positive right away”. She didn’t seem to realize how people treating her worse when she was fat was wrong on their part. Only a few things from the list were actually related to her physical health. Anyway, I totally sympathize with not wanting to be associated with having thin privilege, but I think it’s so important to be able to identify and recognize the privileges we have for virtue of our race, sex, size, able bodies, class, etc etc. 

I can definitely see why you feel how you do, given how you lost your weight and under those circumstances. It’s an achievement, it shows strength of character, resolve, and discipline, all admirable qualities. I just think we need to be wary of stripping fat people of those same qualities in our minds, because they are often exhibiting the same strengths in different areas of life. Their priorities just aren’t the same sometimes."
fatlogic,fcynj8b,t1_fcy55mb,1578083370.0,"I have to disagree. I’m no fan of the FA movement, mostly due to their denial of established medical science and misrepresentation of same, but I think it’s a big mistake to boil obesity down to personal responsibility. First of all, it’s intellectually dishonest, and secondly, it breeds contempt and mistreatment of people suffering with obesity. We don’t know all the factors that contribute to obesity, but we do know it’s way more complicated than personal responsibility. Genetic predisposition is one of many factors, influencing the body’s ability to regulate hunger and fullness, and the brain’s ability to recognize those cues. Other include: unprecedented access to addictive and cheap foods, socioeconomic status, age at which a person becomes overweight or obese (people that become obese in childhood or adolescence are less likely to permanently reverse lifelong habits, and are more likely to identify with their larger bodies as part of their sense of self), cultural traditions (southern and comfort food culture, for instance), access to relevant education and medical care, mental health factors, the objective long-term ineffectiveness of dieting for most people, unsustainable diets and weight loss plans, which burn people out and wear people down every time they fail, etc etc etc. One of my favorite quotes on the subject goes, “You may not be obese because you eat too much. It’s possible you eat too much because you suffer from the disease of obesity.” 

I think the FA movement has some good goals: eradicate fat bias and hate, which is absolutely and undeniably a thing and helps no one. Promote healthy habits and self love regardless of size, because fat people still need to live and love and work and enjoy their lives, and the constant striving for thinness can interfere with those things.

I think the FA movement needs to avoid arguing with the science around obesity, because the science is pretty clear that it’s not healthy. That said, I understand why many fat people are done trying to lose weight. They’ve decided that the psychological stress of never ending weight loss and maintenance attempts aren’t worth the health benefits, and I think that’s a valid choice, so long as it’s an educated one. What’s not valid is discouraging, discrediting, and bullying people who want to lose weight, and especially influencing children to become and remain fat. The decision to remain fat needs to be an educated one, and the FA movement is miseducating their members. But obesity is not going to go away by trying to force individuals to take personal responsibility. It’s like telling poor people to “pull themselves up by the bootstraps”. The solution to both these issues, which are more interconnected than people realize, is systemic and institutional change that makes healthy living easier and more attainable for more people and most importantly for children. It’s in policy changes.

I do not blame this woman one bit for being annoyed that a thin person is coming into a FA space and complaining that she feels bullied blah blah blah. Thin people do not experience socially acceptable body shaming and open hostility. Having a privilege is not a personal judgment on the person who has it. White people aren’t bad for having white privilege. Just because weight loss is possible doesn’t make thin privilege not a thing. That doesn’t mean I agree with how the FA community goes around crying thin privilege about everything from asking for a smaller slice of cake to not wanting to date fatties. But they are correct that it exists, and most people aren’t educated enough on obesity to practice compassion and understanding instead of disgust and judgment. This skinny girl is trying to equate her feeling judged by the FA’s to widespread, acceptable hate and contempt against fat people. I don’t think there’s a comparison. And the FA girl is right to point that out, even if her wording isn’t perfect.

Sorry for the long ass comment. I think this is important, and trust me, my thinking on this has evolved a lot. Just a couple months ago, I started my 5th attempt at losing 40 pounds, after having lost it and gained it all back a couple years ago. I’m loving the process and I’m down 15 pounds, but it really made me think. This has been really hard, but I’m in an ideal situation: I didn’t grow up fat, I come from a culture of health, I am starting on the low end of the obesity spectrum (starting weight 183 at 5’5), I’m relatively young and able bodied, I have the support of my family and SO, I don’t have any mental health issues... If it’s such a process for me, if I could yo-yo like I have, what’s this like for someone trying to lose 200 pounds, who has been fat for most their life, whose family is also fat, who has made attempt after attempt after attempt from middle school on, losing then gaining then losing... I’ve decided my best bet when it comes to this is compassion and support for people like that who are embracing their fatness, even if it means they’ll never be as healthy as me or you."
