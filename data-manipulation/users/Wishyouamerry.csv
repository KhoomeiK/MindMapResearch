IdiotsInCars,ffvbc9y,t3_eveveg,1580260107.0,I like how she acts all pissed off and indignant. Like the cheetahs are seriously inconveniencing her.

I get embarrassed to share my spreadsheets because they seem so janky compared to the smooth stuff you guys do.  :-/  I have come a long way though."
mildlyinteresting,ffv3kmz,t3_evciaw,1580254863.0,When I was a kid I wrote a letter to Jimmy Carter asking him to give my dad a raise (dad was in the Army.) I even included a stick of gum. Jimmy sent back a handwritten postcard with a picture of a white tiger on it! It wasn’t until I was an adult that I realized my mom never mailed my letter and my dad wrote the postcard.

news,ffthms6,t1_fftf1qm,1580220781.0,"Fitness is one of the state requirements.  Also, why would she want to graduate early and miss Prom and senior trip and the graduation ceremony?

EDIT: Also, her school does block scheduling.  She had English IV and Stats last semester.  It's just this quarter she only has fitness and yoga.  Next quarter she'll have Advanced Foods and (I think?) another math elective."
news,fftcjc4,t1_fft7tcn,1580216426.0,My daughter works at Chipotle. The store closes at 10 and they all leave at 10:30. What the hell were you doing for 3+ hours?
