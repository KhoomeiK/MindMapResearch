prozac,ffg24an,t3_et921o,1579896807.0,"People are right to tell you to talk to your doctor.  Your brain can do terrifying and unanticipated things when you abruptly shock your neurotransmitters. 

However if you are unable to consult your doctor or hesitant about how they will go about it, there are a lot of guidelines and resources online for tapering gradually.  One commonly recommended approach is to cut back 10% of your current dosage every two weeks to a month.  [More on that here.](https://www.survivingantidepressants.org/topic/803-dr-peter-breggins-10-taper-method/)  

This does mean mixing your Prozac in a liquid solution (like juice or water) and carefully measuring the dosage unless you can get the liquid form of Prozac or have a compounding pharmacy make it for you.  I tried it summer of last year and gave up after a few months when it became way too cumbersome trying to count each drop of the Prozac cranberry juice solution I would mix each day, and I couldn’t really feel certain that the dosing was accurate.  I went back on my regular 20 mg dose, and then quit cold turkey at the end of December.  It’s been rough but I’ve been managing it, and I think (and hope) the worst is behind me. 

You haven’t been on it all that long, so you’ll probably have less difficulty than other people who have been taking it for years.  But don’t take my word for it, everyone is different.  On the plus side, Prozac has a much longer half-life than other SSRI’s so the withdrawals are less abrupt.  

Whatever you do, put your own well-being above all else even if that means you have to go back on it until you consult your doctor and get on a medically supervised approach to coming off them.  Also bear in mind that there can be a lag of a few weeks until you’re back at the therapeutic dosage should you choose to stop taking it and then resume."
prozac,ffg0akh,t1_fffh9eg,1579895684.0,"I quit cold turkey a month ago yesterday.  This was after 14 months of Prozac 20 mg daily preceded by about four years of other SSRI’s.  Yes, the first two weeks were kind of rough.  Overwhelming brain fog especially when talking to others, staring off into space and getting called out on it more than once, crazy and terrifying dreams that had me consistently waking up covered in sweat, debilitating muscle soreness and tension, flu-like symptoms, and a kind of raw emotional numbness (that might not make sense but I can’t find better words).

I think it’s getting better though.  My circadian rhythm is becoming more normal and I feel less of a buffer between myself and the world.  Some periodic spats of raw depression, but generally I don’t feel much more negative than when I was on it.  I have to remind myself that any weird feelings over the next couple months could very well be post-acute withdrawal symptoms."
selfharm,ff5mfje,t3_dqyu21,1579600156.0,"I used to do this as an infant.  I don’t say this to be condescending.  My younger brother and I, we would get so pissed about the littlest shit and slam our heads into the walls and floors.  I don’t know what triggered it, but something tells me we had a more fucked up childhood than we remember.  He’s been gone for 9 years.   

Miss him everyday.  We were complementary in that he was the charismatic, always in trouble, funny, popular with everyone, day-late and dollar-short guy who always had a smile everyone loved and the drugs to keep them smiling even more. Whereas I was the geek who no one wanted to talk to but just explicitly assumed would be a huge executive or politician and implicitly assumed would be a serial killer (half joking about that last part,  I like to think my peers actually saw better in me even though I was the pretentious weirdo who could never maintain a real conversation).

Entering the dreaded realm of actual adulthood (like 30’s, not late 20’s teens P2) without him here to balance me out makes me want to slam my oversized head right into the fireplace mantel and hope it’s not just a concussion.  Not just the aftermath, but the pure irrational rage is what calls me."
prozac,fetq5us,t1_fes74nd,1579378276.0,"So my general physician put me on Prozac in October 2018 starting at 10 mg everyday for the first two weeks, and then moved me to 20 mg which I stayed on for about the next 14 months.

Taking it every other day at first seems kind of odd, but I guess it’s the same intake as taking half the dose everyday?  Prozac does have a longer half-life than most other SSRI’s so maybe your psych is assuming that the dosage will kind of level out.  Might not be a bad idea to clarify it with him/her."
stopdrinking,feor8fn,t3_eq5wmz,1579304344.0,It's pretty amazing that alcohol is the only food product that doesn't have to have nutritional facts listed on the label.
stopdrinking,feoquf4,t3_eq4ovz,1579304199.0,"Definitely.  The person I was in high school who didn't smoke weed (well hardly smoked weed), drink alcohol, or drink coffee was a hell of a lot more driven and clear-headed.  I was also a lot more naive and yet to face several life-changing personal setbacks, but I'd really like to have that level of mental clarity and ambition that I had back then."
prozac,feoqfj7,t3_eq8ali,1579303950.0,"It could be dryness, maybe?  If you ever wear glasses, do you experience the same effect?  I stopped taking it (still very much adjusting to not taking it), but I noticed it made me significantly more dehydrated."
prozac,feo7i24,t3_eq693f,1579296202.0,"Definitely take it easy when drinking on it, especially the first few times.  Some people find that they can get drunk and even black out much more easily (with SSRI's in general, not just Prozac).  I was starting some med years ago and got to a scary level of being fucked up one time when I went out drinking with friends (I honestly can't remember which med, it was a chaotic time in my life and I stopped it after a short while).  I definitely drank a ton, but the blackout came out of nowhere, and my friends told me that I was a complete asshole.  It was honestly kind of terrifying.

Also, don't be surprised if the hangovers are significantly worse."
stopdrinking,fenpoo7,t3_epz8kp,1579289045.0,"Just curious, do you measure your sobriety in 3-day intervals because they seem more significant?  I only ask because I’ve noticed the first three days are the hardest and maybe acknowledging that small but substantial milestone could help one feel more accomplished."
antidepressants,fe6oncs,t1_fe6grdj,1578898371.0,"I think more people in our generation than we realize (I'm 29) face a lot of similar challenges that we're more likely to open up about when it's anonymous.  At least we have the internet to give us a broader perspective.

Great to hear microdosing is working well for you.  I'm really curious about it, and have been following the sub for a while.  I should stop hesitating a grow a batch.

But good for you to be able to hold down a steady IT job while dealing with the changes in meds and all that comes with it.  Benzo's are supposed to be some of the hardest drugs to get off of, and I can't believe your doctor would be so nonchalant about it.  Even if your current job is not ideal, tech is certainly a growing and demanded field.  Plus a sense of purpose and self-sustainability makes a huge difference to one's self-worth."
prozac,fe67vg8,t3_enp55p,1578883733.0,"I can only somewhat speak from experience having quit cold-turkey three weeks ago, but what I've read online indicates that it can take about 2 months for Prozac to be 90% out of your system.  Unfortunately withdrawals from SSRI's can last many months (boy, do I wish I knew that before starting them but of course stopping antidepressants is a topic of little value to the pharmaceutical industry).  I'm somewhat terrified of what the next couple months have in store, but I don't know that I will ever be able to get off them if I don't now.  Best of luck to you, and treat yourself with ease."
antidepressants,fe6724u,t3_enn92s,1578883243.0,"Please take it easy on yourself as much as possible.  Venlafaxine has a much shorter half-life than other antidepressants, hence the withdrawals hit hard and fast.  Just know that what you are going through, as strange and terrifying as it may be, is the effect of your brain rapidly readjusting to the drastic change in neurotransmitters.  

On the bright side a shorter-half life can potentially mean that the withdrawals might not last as long as they do for other drugs, but it could still be several weeks (or maybe months) of debilitating physical and neurological effects and of course a possible return of depressive symptoms.  

Don't feel bad if you need to go back on them.  Most people will tell you to never go off psychotropics cold-turkey and always consult your doctor about what you are doing.  They are probably right, but I would be a hypocrite if I said the same, having quit Prozac cold-turkey about 3 weeks ago.  Right now, I'm just trying to get through each day one at a time and hoping that I'm a somewhat functional person a few months from now.  Best of luck to you."
antidepressants,fe65ug0,t3_enq1jn,1578882463.0,"Yes, I definitely can empathize with this.  I was put on Adderall in early 2015 and then SSRI's about a year later.  Fall of 2016, I too went for my MBA and the combination seemed to be working, but perhaps a little too well.  I was taking too many classes and stressing myself out about my internship and I eventually had somewhat of a breakdown in 2017 that forced me to take a leave of absence from school.  

Fast forward over 2 years later and I have my degree but not much else to show for it.  I stopped seeing my doctor because I felt ashamed explaining to her that I have yet to find a job, and I'm nervous that she won't want to refill my Adderall because it seems like I'm not doing anything in life.  Being on Prozac without any kind of stimulant leaves me feeling foggy, lethargic, and anxious which certainly doesn't help in interviews.  I quit the Prozac cold-turkey about 3 weeks ago (still in the throes of withdrawals and probably will be for a couple months; I don't recommend this approach to anyone but my last attempt to slowly taper became extremely cumbersome and I gave up).  

Just taking taking life day by day and hoping my neurochemistry returns to a point where I can live with my depression, anxiety, and ADD without any chemical intervention."
stopsmoking,fdh5xzq,t1_fdg2hfv,1578416084.0,Thank you.  Absolutely right.  Both are just feeding a bottomless need instead of providing any kind of benefit.
Sober,fdh4fs0,t1_fdg6otm,1578415160.0,Lol. Thank you but I did not mean to submit this when I did. Had some late night ideas I wanted to jot down and elaborate on later so I tried to save the main ideas as a draft and ended up posting it accidentally.  So deleting now but thanks for the well wishes!
stopsmoking,fcwgs1f,t1_fcweux9,1578025224.0,"Thank you, that gives me a good idea of what to expect.  For personal reasons this next week is probably an ideal time for me to do it.  I’m at my parents for an extended holiday trip and if I can hold off for that long, then I think I’ll be able to keep off of them when I go back to my regular day-to-day and deal with the stressors of job interviews, paying bills, etc.  

I just need to remember that they don’t actually make my life any better and there was a time before I put nicotine or booze in my body and I was overall just fine.  I also need to remind myself that acknowledging stress and discomfort without relying on a chemical crutch is all a part of learning to live with oneself."
antidepressants,fcwfpnk,t3_ej38wv,1578024444.0,"I’ve been on Prozac 20 mg for over a year.  While I will say that it has worked to lift the more debilitating physical symptoms of depression and help with sadness, it also has caused me to have many of the side effects that you are concerned about such as weight gain, tiredness and dullness.  While it’s somewhat circumstantial, my depression has worsened over the past few months.  For me personally, every drug I’ve ever been on “poops out” after about a year.

The brain fog got to the point of being intolerable, and I can’t stand the fact I feel so inarticulate and empty especially when I see it causing me to bomb one job interview after another.  So I stopped cold turkey about a week and a half ago.  Many people will probably say this is stupid and reckless, and they might be right but I desperately want to remember what my brain felt like before starting SSRI’s 4 years ago. I also really could stand to lose about 20 pounds and I am concerned about potential health and neurological effects from long-term use.  I tried tapering off earlier in the year, but mixing it with water and counting out each drop from an oral syringe got to be extremely cumbersome."
stopsmoking,fcwbgw4,t1_f7rf1rs,1578021547.0,"I know this is an old post, but just curious if you cared to share about your experience quitting Zyn.  I am on my Day 1 of not using them (Velo brand actually, but switched to those from Zyn a few weeks ago because they have dosages as low as 2 mg and they’re cheaper).  

I’ve been addicted to 6 mg Zyn pouches for over 3 years after having switched to them from Camel snus.  Before smokeless, I smoked about 1-2 cigarettes each day.  Strangely I never got that strongly addicted to cigarettes, I suppose mainly because they were inconvenient and I had to hide them from my parents, but I’m definitely dependent on nicotine pouches."
stopsmoking,fcwaqu2,t3_eiz6u3,1578021066.0,"I actually came here as a non-smoker who is addicted to Zyn because I was curious as to whether anyone here posts about quitting smokeless alternatives.  They are certainly addicting but they at least do not pose many of the health hazards that cigarettes do.  

The one thing I think might make them advantageous for quitting cigarettes is that you could possibly taper down to lower nicotine doses like 2-3 mg as you feel you are more able to give it up.  I want to make very clear that I’m not aware of any research that backs up this approach, but they are somewhat similar to gum/lozenges in that the  nicotine is dosed by mg and you can purchase lower dose ones.

I am trying to quit them currently having used half a tin of the 6 mg version each day a few months ago and now using only about 3-5 2 mg pouches of a different brand each day.  Today I managed to not have a single one and I feel the itch for it, but it will be a step forward if I can make it to bed without it.  I have got to quit nicotine and seriously cut back on or quit the booze ASAP if I want to be any less of a degenerate this year than I was in 2019."
depression,fcjdr7w,t1_fchniuh,1577684073.0,I just hope it’s quick.
depression,fcjdouh,t1_fcipgqi,1577684014.0,"Agreed.  And I’ve always resented those people who right around New Years are always, “Yeah, fuck this year! Bring on next year!” But 2019 has been really shitty overall. Like literally nothing right went according to plan for myself or anyone I know."
socialanxiety,fcjcbnj,t3_eh352s,1577682843.0,Anyone else wish it hit?
depression,fci1o03,t1_fci0i6f,1577656673.0,"It is, the whole process can break you down.  I've been dealing with it for about 4-5 months.  From what I've been reading on the jobs subs, actively searching and applying for 6 months to a year is not uncommon.  Just give yourself credit for putting yourself out there and trying.  It's hard and humiliating but it's more fulfilling than doing nothing."
depression,fchzufw,t3_eh95ho,1577656080.0,"I am very sorry.  I am in that boat and I will say that it absolutely sucks being stuck in the catch-22 of needing a job to improve your circumstances and self-worth but being unable to get one because of your depression.  Forgive yourself and keep in mind that we're all just numbers to employers, whether we're mentally healthy or not.  It's a matter of beating them at their own game and giving them the right line of BS to get our foot in the door; easier said than done, but my point is don't blame yourself."
antidepressants,fchw367,t3_ehajou,1577654817.0,"Of course this is ultimately up to your doctor, but I will mention that Prozac is commonly prescribed to people who are on SSRI’s with shorter half-lives and are looking to get off of them.  The reason is that Prozac has a much longer half-life and thus leaves one’s system more gradually than other SSRI’s. You should have no trouble finding more info about this online if you want to familiarize yourself with it  more before speaking with your doctor."
depression,fchumc3,t3_ehamy2,1577654331.0,"People hate people, especially on the Internet.  Doesn’t mean we are all douchebags.  Some of us genuinely want to have empathy for others, even for those with whom we have zero connection, simply because we desperately want to feel human.  

Others are more superficial and at the end of the day it will only contribute to their ego getting in the way of their well-being.  

I’m giving you the requested upvote because I believe that we can maybe, just maybe, live in a world in which at least some of us acknowledge and respect each other without there being any judgement or self-absorbed expectation."
prozac,fcaito9,t1_fcagg2n,1577569987.0,Thanks! Saving this.
prozac,fc9dok6,t1_fc8puvo,1577551060.0,"Thank you.  I’ve been seeing a lot of positive responses to fish oil from people on this sub, and I think I will have to step mine up.  I usually take 1000 mg of a store brand variety once a day, but I very often forget and I don’t think it quite does enough."
depression,fc9cpme,t1_fc63w84,1577550616.0,"29, same, decent education including a graduate degree I got this year and what I thought was decent job experience.  Still no prospects and facing the possibility of moving back in with my elderly father.  It’s frustrating to think that trying to do all the things that seemed right at the time can amount to absolutely nothing, at least in the short term."
prozac,fc7m9pj,t1_fc1ayzx,1577512083.0,"I think you should be okay after only 13 days.  SSRI’s take 4-6 weeks to reach the full effect anyway.  You will probably still feel depressed without any other kind of approach, but I don’t think withdrawals will be noticeable after quitting so early.  Honestly you probably haven’t reached the therapeutic level yet and you’re likely feeling the side effects more as you adapt to it, but I can’t blame you for quitting if you’re confident you can do without them.  They are not 100% harmless and they don’t come without potentially serious drawbacks.  

I quit cold turkey myself after a year plus of use about a week ago and I honestly feel pretty weird.  Ton of pressure in my head and feel very on edge.  I know it’s not the smartest thing to do, but I tried slowly tapering over 2 months earlier this year and got tired of dealing with it and went back on.  I’ve got to get off eventually.  Anti-D’s are not good for the kidneys or other organs over long-term use, and I can’t stand the mild confusion and feeling of blandness.

Good luck, and I hope you can find a non-drug approach that helps."
depression,faiyomr,t1_faixvlt,1576119816.0,"That runs through my mind throughout each day.  The only thing keeping it from becoming an intention is my parents.  I'm living for them at this point, at that's not sustainable.  I can only do my best to get through each day and hope that something shifts in the meantime.

I've been wondering lately what ""alternatives"" to suicide are as in getting rid of all my possessions, giving up on my supposed dreams, and living life as if I were never myself.  It's just a vague thought bubble that doesn't amount to anything at this point, but it might be my only hope.  That or a better drug.  I sincerely hope you and I find some more forward-looking ""what ifs."""
