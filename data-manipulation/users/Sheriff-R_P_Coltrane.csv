You only have to choose a major field of study that can generate an actual salary once you've graduated.

Compare mechanical engineering to some social studies program and it's obvious who had to actually work for their degree.  
Now for all you painters who are already triggered, my advice is learn a useful skill in college and take elective art courses to break up the insanity.  Keep art as a hobby while you make a great living in a useful field."
