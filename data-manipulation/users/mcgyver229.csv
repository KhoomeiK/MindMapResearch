electroplating,fffwo9f,t3_eter7j,1579893439.0,the old plating needs to be completely stripped off.  the base metal must be buffed completely clean so there is no rust.  then you can acid etch and plate.  you'll never be able to plate over that.  it could be chrome which is a whole nother ball game.  leave that to the pros.
