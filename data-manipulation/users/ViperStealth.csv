""Well, back in the day, we used to artificially inseminate cows with bull's semen to get them pregnant, then we hooked them up to milking machines when they began lactating. When they gave birth, we separated their baby calf from the mother to increase the amount of milk produced from the mother cow. When we got the milk, we'd then make it into cheese and sell it to people""

""You guys were weird man."""
environment,ffi2qc8,t1_ffhthxi,1579963360.0,"You're absolutely right.

The world will be fine, it's just pretty much every species on it that will be fucked."
environment,fff121e,t1_fff0o1y,1579872742.0,"He's probably referring to climate change specifically - not man made global warming.

Climate deniers often point out that the climate changes naturally over time to ignore the scientific consensus that man made global warming is a critical threat."
PlantBasedDiet,ff6q7fi,t1_ff6q1u3,1579632591.0,No worries. Thanks for the tip.
PlantBasedDiet,ff6px69,t1_ff6o0iz,1579632420.0,"Dubai has cheap blueberries, so this should be easy for me to get. Indian foods are also cheaply imported here :)"
PlantBasedDiet,ff6ptev,t1_ff6omq9,1579632357.0,"Thanks. Will read the content of the link.

You said 'not true' but do you have evidence to support that claim? That's precisely what I'm looking for, if available."
PlantBasedDiet,ff6nrwk,t1_ff6l5ns,1579631131.0,"Probably going off topic as this isn't WFPB but I really struggle to back a diet that recommends the exclusion of many fruits. Can you explain the Keto position on this?

I've also met only obese people doing keto, never someone with a normal BMI / level of physical activity. I realise this is purely anecdotal but these people have also not been fans of getting their bloodwork done and ignore their LDL Cholesterol levels and fibre intake.

Would be interested to learn more on that."
PlantBasedDiet,ff6kson,t1_ff6kkms,1579629324.0,"Dates are plentiful here and very cheap. I also like them and use date sugar as my sweetener of choice, so I'll checkout your link - thanks again!"
PlantBasedDiet,ff6k0ar,t1_ff6hokm,1579628838.0,"When I moved houses (and country) I was learning where to get my shopping from - complete nutrition.

Whilst I was doing this and getting used to a new job / new country/culture I had Huel about 80% of the time for around a month. I had no complaints: My energy and gym work was great. I didn't get bored of it and my stools were a healthy shape etc.

However, just thought I shouldn't use personal anecdote as my standard for the bar of research.

I have to say, even though I enjoy using Huel, I'd like to scientificly learn why a WFPB diet is better.."
PlantBasedDiet,ff6jll9,t1_ff6ixtj,1579628590.0,"Thanks for the well thought out response. Appreciated.

I live in Dubai and Larabar hasn't made the way here yet. Maybe there is a suitable alternative though."
confidentlyincorrect,ff59475,t1_ff571dl,1579583940.0,"Well, why not both?

I think putting pigs into gas chambers, blending male chicks alive on day 1 of their life and separating calves from their mother's is gross and cruelty.

What do you think?"
confidentlyincorrect,ff542bs,t1_ff3tzqn,1579579652.0,I'm against cruelty to others.
nonononoyes,ff3pd73,t1_ff3gwct,1579545977.0,"Try reducing saturated fats and LDL cholesterol (high in animal based foods).

Eating a whole foods plant based diet is possibly the best way to lose unhealthy weight.

Carbohydrates aren't bad. Avoid carbs with a low Carbohydrate to fibre ratio and you're fine (to be healthy, divide Carbs on the nutrition facts by Fibre. If the result is over 5, put it back onto the shelf)."
vegan,ff2oct3,t1_ff2nuc3,1579516188.0,"I was always taught that if you don't say what you mean, you'll never mean what you say."
GetMotivated,ff24217,t1_ff0wxpo,1579493228.0,"Well, I wouldn't say that any amount of unnecessary animal cruelty is fine but I understand and agree with your sentiment, less harm is better than full harm.

Dairy is far more cruel than meat, so better to cut back on that first maybe."
vegan,ff23ulq,t1_ff0k74w,1579493070.0,"A weird take?

Can't means unable to. How are you techically unable to?"
