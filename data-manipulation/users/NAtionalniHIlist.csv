I don't study and therefore don't know the customs regarding Latin language in the field, but did you just decline the noun ""uterus"" to its Dative form due to the preposition *in*? Is it a common practice in medicine?"

German and Austrian using ß doesn't make them nazi, agree? 

If you have trouble explaining your thought in english then SPRICH DEUTSCH DU HURENSOHN (this is a popular joke here on reddit, deal with it). And no, I'm neither white nor do I have german nationality, so I'm inherently not a nazi, for your information."
