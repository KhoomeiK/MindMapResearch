Think about that for a while and let it sink in. “You” are in the present time, and what actions you now decide to take are a much more important part of you than your past mistakes. Show the same love to yourself that any other person should deserve, part of that is understanding your past decisions (not making excuses for them, but understanding them). What you did was operate to the best of your ability with what you had. You obviously now have a clearer outlook, so do with that what you feel you must do."

If you want to get more air you can apply pressure on the ramp and release it at the lip, I wouldn’t call it a jump though but that’s kind of what it is. It’s more like a little springier exit rather than simply skiing straight off it. But it helps to think about how far your jump will take you - by judging that correctly you can judge how much forward lean you leave the lip with so that you’ll be level at the apex of the jump and continue to move forward into the downhill part of the landing. Again it helps to imagine the entire jump as one fluid motion and it will be more natural to make these adjustments."

To be precise, one might say that “privilege of majority” is the problem.

What you need to do (at least) is provide what is called “logical charity” which is basically the position of trying to interpret what someone says in the most rational sense, instead of holding them accountable for every word or phrase they utter, chopping it up and criticizing it. This whole video and the arguments behind it come off as a pointless ad hominem from a stubbornly defensive person trying to invalidate perfectly useful advice. JP is not a perfect human, did he ever claim to be? This narrator attacks the person JP instead of his arguments. What’s your goal Narrator, is it to convince others that JP is not a perfect human (if so then you really didn’t have to make the effort to prove that), or did you want to argue against the validity of his rules? If you want to argue against the usefulness of his rules then you should pursue that instead of attacking his failure to adhere perfectly to his own advice, or speak perfectly at all times. This video comes from a clear misunderstanding of what the rules actually are - they are recommendations to live life better. Whether JP follows them perfectly is irrelevant, and to attack his failure of strict adherence is petty and misguided."
