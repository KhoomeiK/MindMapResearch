iamatotalpieceofshit,ffwc0rh,t1_ffw8m7e,1580294669.0,"PETA has a high killrate compared to other shelters because they don't believe in letting animals suffer. Other shelters will let a sick dog die slowly, whereas PETA will humanely stop their suffering.

On top of this, they operate free collection lines in areas with high poverty, meaning they get lots of neglected dogs that are in many cases not fit for adoption.

The arguments against them are largely sourced to beef industry lobby groups, which want to turn public opinion against them for obvious reasons."
iamatotalpieceofshit,ffwbkz7,t1_ffwakmn,1580294070.0,I feel for you but you're going to get a lot of hates. Dogs are an animal you aren't allowed to not like on the internet.

I'm a recent subscriber and my first thought was ""oh so this is one of _those_ channels""

The only time pizzagate should be brought up is an example of clearly false right wing conspiracies."

MapPorn,fd9smob,t3_ekbtk0,1578237592.0,"This isn't accurate. It's likely a visualization of all fire callouts or incidents, so it includes small fires that aren't really a concern i.e grass fires on empty lots. It's also likely over an extremely long period. 

The fires are extremely bad but this isn't amazingly accurate as a visualization."
