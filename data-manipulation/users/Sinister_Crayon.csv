atheism,ffwot4a,t3_evexse,1580307315.0,"I've heard this strawman argument many times while debating Christians. It really is pointless to argue because they come from the point of view that Humans require faith, and that atheism is just another form of faith; another belief system if you will. It's patently untrue as atheism is not a belief, it's a label for a position. That position being that there is no evidence for God or whatever deity you wish to insert in here, but there is mounting evidence and theory which allows us to explain the universe and our position in it without resorting to some irreducible factor that Christians refer to as ""God"".

Now, there is some weight to their argument that we cannot explain the creation of the universe and this argument almost always devolves into them claiming the position that God has always existed. This is not an explanation though they often frame it as such; it's again an irreducible factor that is akin to throwing your hands up in the air and saying ""I just don't know, so I'm going to attribute it to some entity."" Why not attribute it to random chance or something like that? Because Christians (and in fact almost all religious people) need to find meaning in existence in order to feel like their lives are worthwhile. The reason we can never argue with the religious on this point is because we as atheists don't have an answer. However, as a scientist and atheist the best argument I can give is that the reason we don't have an answer and may never have an answer is because our perception of the entire universe is incomplete and always will be because we do not have the capability to perceive it beyond our own limited physical understanding (four dimensions, one of which being time). There are plenty of good theories about why we perceive the universe in this way and plenty of theories as to how the universe itself is actually structured. These may be utterly wrong, but we can come close to proving these theories by testing the universe within our own ""perceptive bubble"" and seeing if the results fit the theory. There is literally no way to ""test God"" because he/she/it is portrayed as being some conscious entity that is beyond testing.

For my part I don't need God to give my life meaning. I don't need meaning in existence beyond the meaning I give my own existence. And that meaning has morphed and changed throughout my life as my life has changed in both positive and negative ways. The meaning I ascribe to my own existence today is absolutely not the meaning I ascribed to it when I was 20. I also don't need God to give me a moral compass because I already have one. I actually don't mind people in my life who need God for meaning or a moral compass, what I do mind though is those who feel that I am in need of saving or that I need to be converted to some religion. I don't. I'm perfectly happy as I am and most people around me would say I am a good person, good parent and loving partner. I fail to see what changing me from atheist to Christian (or other religion) would accomplish. 

Am I afraid of some Christian proving God's existence? Nope, not at all and in fact I welcome it. But not because I'd be relieved that God exists but because something will have been proven about the universe and our place in it. Thing is, when your evidence is ""Read the Bible"" I am going to just stop you there and say that the Bible is not evidence of anything but that people bound together a book of stories and distributed it claiming it to be the ""word of God"". I can easily bind together the writings of just about any group of people and claim the same thing but that collection of writings is no more the ""word of God"" than the Bible is. It's just an anthology of stories similar to the myriad books released every year that are a collection of stories from Sci-Fi writers, or Romance writers, or insert your poison here.

The thing is I also accept that without God there is no Heaven or Hell. Again, I don't need the promise of reward or threat of damnation to be a moral person. I do that on my own and I'd bet most Christians I know probably don't know that I'm an atheist unless we've specifically had that conversation. I avoid religion as a conversation as a general rule unless someone tries to preach to me. I am at least as moral as the average person who goes to church every sunday, and more moral than some of them. The strength I find in this position is that without the promise of any sort of afterlife, it is upon me to make my life today and tomorrow count for something at least to those around me and who may still be here after I am dead. I do this because I am not selfish and self-centered... well, I am a bit but I think everyone is. Again, I am at least as selfless as the average churchgoer, and more selfless than some.

Some Christians also like the strawman that science is a belief system as well. This is patently false for so many reasons I am not going to dig into here because I really need to get to work and haven't had nearly enough coffee yet. But what I will say is that I do prefer talking to Christians who will at least meet me half way on the idea that at least evolution can be seen either as the natural process by which life exists or ""the method God uses to create life"". At least from that point I can get on board with them as they at least accept one major aspect of existence that we can show clearly in the fossil record of the Earth. Those Christians who try to argue that all life was created 6000 years ago exactly as it exists today are already ignoring a mountain of evidence to the contrary and thus probably can't be argued with in any rational manner."
cars,ffqqdac,t1_ffqo6f8,1580141196.0,"LOL... definitely truth there. I do get BMW's logic though; they were trying to give a more ""luxurious"" experience which is what led some guys to come up with this turn-signal thing. The thinking was that they wanted to have something that didn't ""clunk and crack"" when resetting to the center position, thus taking away a ""distracting nuisance"" of the noise. And no, I'm not making any of this up... I remember watching a whole section of a video about it at the BMW Welt back in 2011 when I did a Euro Delivery on a 135i. They were awfully proud of this ""reinvention"" of the turn signals.

As I said though, I honestly didn't even think about the turn signals in my Alfa until your review of the Stelvio..."
cars,ffqktsq,t1_ffp720y,1580137310.0,"You know what? I don't miss manuals.

Almost all of my cars have been manuals; the only exceptions I can think of offhand were an E92 M3 (DCT) and 135i (DCT). I really thought I would be missing it now after almost a year with my QV but I really don't. Yeah, there's a lot of engagement to be had with a manual, but the QV has taught me that with enough engagement in the rest of the chassis you don't need that manual transmission. Sure, I still drive it in manual mode 99% of the time (those shift paddles are freaking glorious) and the car really has to warm up before you get the lightning-bolt shifts that the ZF is capable of (it's SUPER slow when the transmission is cold). But realistically I find as a daily driver I live with, the QV is so much easier to cruise around in... much easier to be in the right gear at all times (I don't have to worry about ""lifting"" when in a corner; I can just downshift if I want to).

Sure, it probably promotes some lazy driving habits... but I'm not a guy who dailies his car on the track. I am not trying to impress anyone with my ""mad clutch skillllzzzzz"". I just want a car that will go fast in the direction I want it to go and do what I tell it... the QV does that for me.

Kudos to ZF for basically perfecting the automatic transmission."
cars,ffqjsx2,t1_ffohl26,1580136546.0,"Yeah, the QV doesn't need more power. It already overcomes the traction of the Pirelli Corsas with ease and can get you into trouble SUPER quickly if you're not careful. 

Now, if they combined the weight savings with the rear-biased AWD system they have in the Stelvio or base Giulia then you'd have a car that'd be faster. Just having more HP I am not convinced would make much of a difference in acceleration times because you'll need some incredibly sticky rubber on them in order to use it."
cars,ffqjk3i,t1_ffpdl07,1580136358.0,"The turn signal thing was a BMW thing for a long time and Alfa just picked up on it. I guess having been a BMW driver for over a decade I just became super accustomed to it and didn't think about it until I saw u/Doug-Demuro and his review of the Stelvio I think. Basically if you want to cancel the turn signal, then do a half-click (half way, first ""detent"") the opposite direction... the same amount of travel you'd use for the ""three-flashes"" merge signal. 

It's in the owner's manual BTW.

cars,ffqj1vy,t1_ffocyzx,1580135967.0,"Honestly it's not that bad... at least with the steel brakes. It was a bit odd at first, but I quickly got accustomed to it. Now, having said that the entire car is a little ""binary"" in that it's either on or off... not a lot of nuance. Part of that is the carbon fiber propshaft that transmits every little shimmy of the drivetrain to the rear wheels; a steel driveshaft will actually flex more than a CF one and so soak up a lot of the harshness inherent in an ICE drivetrain.

It took me maybe two weeks at most to become accustomed enough to the car that I was able to accelerate and brake smoothly... which is actually about average if you really take the time to learn your cars. It's noticeable how different it is when someone else drives my car because they're not nearly as smooth... but they don't daily the QV :)"

todayilearned,ffmx1gw,t1_ffmggst,1580059770.0,"There's some truth to this... but at the end of the day it's down to YOU to control the narrative when you work from home.

I've been 100% WFH for 6 years. For the first two years of that the closest office I could've gone to was in Chicago (about 300 miles) and even since we got an office it's completely optional. When I started I made it SUPER clear to people that between the hours of 8 and 5, I am at work. No distractions, no errands, no nothing. That was tough at first as my desk was in the corner of my open-plan condo... but I moved shortly after and dedicated an entire room of my house to the office, buying a really nice desk from a company that sells furniture liquidated from companies. 

Now, is this 100% successful? Yes and no. I will admit, I do go and grab the groceries during the day, usually on a slow afternoon because it's quieter and easier than trying to go on the weekends. But I don't clean house for example, or do anything other than emergency repairs (like a leaky roof last week). But I still tell people that between 8 and 5 I'm officially at work and if they want to get a hold of me they can text or call me like anyone else. During this 6 years I have become an empty-nester so that helps. Just like people in offices go to the kitchen and talk to their peers, if I am not visiting a customer or going to the office that day then I will walk the dog to the local coffee shop in the morning and grab myself a cup of coffee to break up the monotony of work.

But you know what? Despite all this I am more productive than I have ever been at an office. On those days when I do go to the office, I often find that I spent most of my time talking to my colleagues about useless crap than actually working unless I bring my noise canceling headphones and make it REALLY clear that I'm there to work. Even then, honestly I have better Internet at home than we have at the office so I actually get slowed down by that a lot. My job satisfaction is great... and while it's not an easy job by any stretch (in many ways a lot harder than my last work-in-office job) I wouldn't trade it for the world because generally I am far happier.

All it takes is discipline and finding what works for you... but once you find your rhythm then you'll find yourself far more productive and useful to your employer."

Sure, I drive an absolutely AMAZING car now but it's not like this was my first car. Heck, my first car was a Volkswagen Beetle that was older than me and I loved it... only got rid of it because I only had parking for one car and my work (mid '90's London) came with a company car. My second car (moved to the USA) was a lump of Detroit steel the same age as the Volkswagen that got me 9 miles per gallon on a good day with a following wind and drank oil almost as fast as it drank gasoline. I both loved and hated both of those cars for different reasons.

My first NEW car was a 2000 Pontiac Grand Prix that I absolutely loved and probably would've kept until the wheels fell off except that my wife at the time hated it... said the seats were uncomfortable and the back seat and trunk were too small. With two small kids at the time yeah, I have to agree... but man I loved that thing dearly and missed it. As a side note I am 90% certain I saw my exact car about two weeks ago down South of St. Louis... it was in semi rough shape but there was a specific modification that I had made to the car (appearance) that was on this exact car I saw... the odds are definitely good that was my old car.

We all have those cars we have loved. Sometimes it's the one we currently drive, sometimes it isn't. My favourite car I ever owned was a 1995 Subaru SVX that I last saw some 10 years after I had gotten rid of it in the collection of a guy who had 3 SVX's he was attempting to rebuild into one working car... apparently the transmission had failed as well as having a lot of body issues in the time since I had sold it... I actually traded it on that Grand Prix oddly enough.

PFSENSE,fdqgbn8,t3_empv2r,1578665952.0,"You said in other posts you're using DD-WRT. While you'll hear a lot of the positives of PFSense, if what you're seeking is security you may or may not be better off with PFSense. Both platforms are built to be secure by default, but there's no question that PFSense is more scalable than DD-WRT. That's simply because there's more headroom in the hardware platform for features like IDS/IPS (Suricata/Snort) and stuff like that. DD-WRT is very limited in scope but is pretty secure by default. PFSense can also scale to larger connection sizes due to the CPU available... but since you're on 60mbps you're not going to see any significant difference, if any.

Now, if you want to be able to add features to your router like a proper IDS/IPS then PFSense is a great platform. However, be aware that it's easy to add too much and thereby hobble your security if you're not careful. PFSense is highly configurable and as such you can do a lot with the platform that DD-WRT can't. 

Depends on your use case. Sounds like you already have the hardware, so why not just go ahead and give it a shot? You can use your DD-WRT device as just an AP on your network and build a new firewall. If you don't like it or it doesn't work out for you, just switch your WAN connection back to your router and set it back up as your Internet connection device. Never hurts to play with it, right?"
AskReddit,fdowvw4,t1_fdnua68,1578614724.0,"EDIT: I posted an expanded version of this post to my own blog site if you're interested in reading it; [Best Practices for Data Integrity and Security are Frequently Written in Blood](https://www.nodecaf.net/blog/2020/01/10/best-practices-for-data-integrity-and-security-are-frequently-written-in-blood/)

Oooh… now that's sort of a loaded question with a really long (and winding) answer. But in summary for your use case? Yeah, it's probably just fine.

This is gonna be a long explanation...

Now, let me expand on that answer a little. If you're not tech savvy and want to offload the responsibility of ensuring your data integrity to a third party, then cloud-based systems are just fine. The only caveat is that none of the providers make any guarantees as to the long term viability of your data... like will you be able to retrieve it in a decade? The answer is likely yes, but they don't GUARANTEE that. Not even slightly. They don't even guarantee your data will be there tomorrow. But statistically speaking, the number of things that can go wrong that will render your data irretrievable is actually pretty small. But it does, and has happened to others. Data integrity in ""The Cloud"" is ""best effort""

There's also the privacy aspect of entrusting your data to a third party who promise to do their best to ensure your data is secure. Worked well for Scarlett Johansson… and Jennifer Lawrence (the iCloud hack nicknamed ""The Fappening"" if you want to read up on what I'm talking about). Simply put; you are entrusting your data to a third party who actually have only a passing amount of responsibility to secure your data. Depending on your perceived sensitivity of the information at-hand that could be either a ""Meh, I don't care"" or a ""WTF, that's insane!"" sort of response. Cloud storage in general relies on the general idea that in a literal sea of information, your little puddle will basically go unnoticed... but that's not always the case as can be seen with any number of hacks and cracks that have put all of our personal information out there in the last few years. Data security in ""The Cloud"" is ""best effort""

With photos in particular you also have to note that only specialist providers actually give you the ability to store raw photos in any significant quantity. Almost all of them are compressed in some way which loses data. This doesn't mean much when you're talking about snapshots of your kids at the zoo (well, it might... but that's another thing). But to me who does studio photography and portraits for professionals as a little bit of a sideline want to keep the RAW data around (and it can be huge) so I can clean up, edit and rebalance shots in ways you can't do with JPEG or other compression schemes because they've lost so much of their original data to compression. This is acceptable to most people because JPEG or PNG at 10MP resolutions and up (pretty typical cellphone camera) looks good enough on most modern monitors... even 4K. But here's the thing; you don't really have a 10MP picture; you have roughly a 4MP picture (an example, not literally) with artifacts and literal missing data. To get 10MP or above you need to be using RAW format... and don't even get me started on lenses... 

Would *I* entrust all my data to a cloud provider? Oh hell no. But that's not specifically because of any of these reasons I've already cited, though they are all factors. I don't *have* to; I am a technical specialist and build large computer systems (including archival storage systems) for a living... so doing the same thing on a smaller scale in my own home is actually a bit of a hobby to me and I can leverage the tools and knowledge I have professionally for exactly this purpose. It's *fun* to do this (to me) and I love being able to entrust my RAW photos to storage that I know is highly unlikely to lose or corrupt that data... because I can. I also back that data up in two places in my house and one outside (Amazon S3 Glacier storage... encrypted when I upload it). I intend to add another one as soon as my neighbor friend has gotten his Internet installed in his new house and we start backing up each others critical data to each others arrays. Do I *need* to do all this? No... but as I said, it's also a hobby of mine. 

Bear in mind my problem of lost data was years ago, on a technology you probably aren't using any more (spinning rust hard drives). I made a stupid decision not to have good backups... I learned that one the hard way but I've moved on from it thankfully. For you? I would say the ""Cloud"" is perfect. It'll suit your needs, statistically you probably won't ever have a data loss problem and it just doesn't require any real thought on your part. HOWEVER, I will caveat that with the idea that you *SHOULD* have another backup. Yes, you have the photos probably on your phone and computer, and uploaded to the cloud. Great. Copy them to another cloud. Sign up for SmugMug or some such and upload your photos there as well... because you never know when that data may suddenly become inaccessible. There are plenty of horror stories out there about people whose accounts got hacked, or locked, or deleted... rendering all their data inaccessible. Having multiple accounts WITH DIFFERENT PASSWORDS is vital in my opinion in case a service gets hacked. Use a password manager like LastPass (I use Dashlane personally) to ensure your cloud accounts are locked up and change your passwords often. 

Don't let stories like mine scare you. I just happen to have enough caution with technological solutions that I tend to overdo redundancy at times. But as I'm fond of saying to my customers; ""Best practices for data integrity and security are frequently written in blood."" I have had experiences I've learned from... and I've got the knowledge and skills to build something that I'm comfortable entrusting my data to. The average home user doesn't... and shouldn't. We as technology experts are entrusted with making these complex things accessible to people like yourself... and honestly your cloud backup is probably backed by something not dissimilar to what I've built... just on a far larger scale. 

Hope all of this helps, and if you have any more questions feel free to ask."

sysadmin,fde2h37,t3_ekvdzm,1578329694.0,"Unfortunately, job-hopping seems to be the thing to do in early career in IT. My first IT job I stayed for 3 years, which might not seem like much but for a (then) 21 year old it was a lifetime. My next job lasted only a year because I had my eye on another prize, namely a move to the USA... which for someone who had grown up in Northern Ireland and England was a heck of an opportunity.

The next almost decade was a lot of job hopping. It became clear that as a young IT guy I was getting pretty nicely shafted by companies who didn't want to pay, but as my skills increased and became apparent they were all too happy to pile new responsibilities on my shoulders without a raise. So job-hopping became the norm and my eye was always open for that next opportunity.

But there does come a point where you're not job-hopping. My last job before my current one was 7 years... my current job has been 5 years so far and still going strong. It's not about the money for me any more but rather the sense of satisfaction I get from doing my job. I almost doubled my pay in that last transition, but it was shifting to a very different focus (pre-sales systems architect from a sysadmin role officially that had been loaded up with a bunch of other responsibilities including management of a small team). Now if I made a transition to another company it would be more because I was unhappy with my current role than about the money. Sure, more money would be awesome but I am not in a place where it is required. My focus has shifted from immediate gain to investing in my future... guess that happens after you get past 40! But as a result I have taken that money from the job shift and am using to set myself up for retirement rather than significantly changing my lifestyle.

So yes; in summary it is quite normal to job hop for quite a while... and that's not seen as a negative necessarily in the IT field. Each new job brings new experiences which you can then use to bring value to the next employer. At least in this field, the idea that you're going to work for one company for 40 years is quite ridiculous in my opinion."

Runs Linux on it (she is quite opposed to Windows) and plays quite a lot of games, watches movies off our Plex server and stuff like that. It's been an impressive machine... not just for the price but generally an impressive machine. It's also been excellent for her school work."

The simple fact is that we still don't have a definitive answer to the question yet, but there are plenty of ongoing studies trying to figure this out. There are a number of other papers that are similar to this, but similar numbers that are in direct opposition. That's the great thing about science :)"
