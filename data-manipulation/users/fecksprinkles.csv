dndnext,ffdcmsq,t1_ffckxw4,1579818050.0,"I only came to D&D a few years back when I finally convinced my friends to give it a go after I'd been longing to play for a decade.

I couldn't work out why so many people on here disliked the Forgotten Realms. To me, the crazy pick-and-mix feel of it is exactly what I love, and I prefer it to a more mundane setting that's pretty much just ""medieval but with magic."" I saw people complaining about how overfull the world is and couldn't understand why anyone would feel like there was too much to link into. There's just so much to take in that there's always a story hook around every corner. 

About a month back I started reading the 3e Guide to Faerun and holy bloody shit are the FR stacked. You can't swing a cat without knocking down a wall into a Drow settlement. You can't fall in a pit that wasn't previously avoided by Laeral Silverhand or one of her sisters. Every magic weapon has been cursed by some archdemon in a named war between specific tribes of certain races 400 years ago, or discarded by Khelben Blackstaff while he was spring cleaning last tenday. 

By the end of the book I just felt overwhelmed - like there was no space for my stories to occur because anything I do would conflict with canon. And I have players who are as new to the FR as I am so I'd only be annoying myself. I can only imagine the pain of coming up with a new story when your players are D&D veterans."

whatisthisthing,fdogzm0,t1_fdo2k7l,1578604955.0,"Could not agree more. The article reads like doctors are required to be rough and harsh with the standard speculum but I've had loads of pelvic examinations over the years and not once has the doctor been anything but gentle, even when I had an absolute bitch of a gyno. And the new ones don't make a noise at all, which kind of sucks for me because I actually liked that clicking noise the old ones made. 

And as you said, a blow-up speculum is useless. Great. You can see the cervix. Now what? Not like you can take a pap smear with a balloon blocking it all up down there. Not like you can check the walls. 

Why would they decide to design it with the patient in mind OVER the doctor? I'm not getting a pelvic examination for the fun of it, I'm there for a bloody medical reason."
DndAdventureWriter,fdmyvg2,t3_ely20m,1578571788.0,"This one's a bit out there, but... a child. 

When I was a kid I had a sudden realisation that I would die some day and it was fucking *terrifying.* I would have done almost anything for immortality then.

dndmemes,fdls9b6,t1_fdlppb0,1578531278.0,"I can't even remember, but I'm pretty sure I just awkwardly went along with it. Those first few months of DMing were hard as hell. The first few *years,* actually. I had no idea what I was doing and became convinced I was doing terribly, even when people kept telling me they loved my games and were having fun. 

Now I care less about keeping my story intact and more about keeping my world intact. If the PCs get arrested for murdering a shopkeeper, either the next game is a prisonbreak one and they get to spend the rest of the campaign dodging high-level bounty hunters, or they get executed and make new characters. Meanwhile whatever quest they had is progressing without them. 

In all honesty though, I don't really have to deal with it anymore. We were all learning the game at the same time and we were all making mistakes like murderhoboing, or being chaotic stupid, or being weirdly sexual. In time we all realised that being idiots wasn't as fun as getting an actual story."

I was a new DM and couldn't think on the fly. I couldn't work out quickly enough how to have NPCs respond in-character and in a way that actually stopped murder-hoboing rather than encouraged it. 

I could have stopped it out of game by calling my players on their behaviour - but again, I was a new DM and wasn't sure if I was being unfair by telling my players that I didn't want them to do certain things."

Of course, that meant I'd have dirty hands from the flush button, so I constructed an elaborate routine to protect myself:

I'd finish whatever I was doing, turn the tap on and semi-wash my hands, go back to the loo, flush it with my soapy hands, then rush back to the sink to rinse off, turn the tap off, and leg it out the door before the monster arrived.

I went through about a two month period where I couldn't yawn. I'd inhale deeply and it just wouldn't finish. I'd end up trying and trying and it just got worse and worse. I couldn't sleep because I'd just be lying there trying to do my final bedtime yawn and get comfortable. After a month or so I started to have panic attacks when going to bed because I knew i wouldn't be able to sleep because of yawn failure. I genuinely thought I was going crazy from stress and insomnia. 

Then one day I yawned while distracted with something else and I realised it was from overthinking. From then on I could yawn again.
