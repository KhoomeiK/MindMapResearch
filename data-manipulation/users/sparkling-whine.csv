cats,febpkcf,t1_fe8ldal,1578961308.0,Oh my god what a horrible thought!!! I could never take that chance with my own kitties. But I sure would love to stay at an AirBnB with a cat included! I got close once in Iceland. The neighbor’s cat that we had been talking to/petting outside all week got into our apartment and would not leave. So we just enjoyed his company until he decided to leave.
