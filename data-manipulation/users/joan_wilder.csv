science,ffrnwm3,t1_ffrk3ra,1580161957.0,"no one has any incentive to be cost-conscious, anyway. as a healthcare consumer in the US, the only way to be cost-conscious is to simply not go to the doctor, and that’s how the health insurance industry likes it. 

the healthcare providers create the prices with zero input from the actual consumer. their “consumer” is actually the private insurance industry, which also has no incentive to be cost-conscious because we are at the mercy of our employers whether we’re insured or not, and we have no say in the price, except to say that we’ll just accept less or no coverage at all. the health insurance and healthcare industries simply figure out how much they can charge us, and there’s nothing we can do about it. 

a public option would actually bring the costs down because the government isn’t a business — providing a service to our people would be the goal, not profits. instead of giving a blank check to healthcare providers, a public service would be under public pressure to scrutinize and negotiate costs with the providers. 

i know people argue that putting the government in charge would corrupt the system, and a few people would get rich, but that’s what we already have. a public option would add a level of accountability that doesn’t currently exist. the people that call it communism and whatnot are irrational, and they’re against the government, in general. they’re the same people that hate USPS because they’d rather allow FedEx and UPS profit whenever you send or receive a check or a letter in the mail. they’re the same people that think it’s a good idea to privatize the justice system, and allow companies to profit when people go to prison. they’re the same people that believe all roads should be toll roads. they’re the same people that are against net neutrality. the arguments against public healthcare are propaganda. 

to be clear, the private insurance industry is massive, and it would be very dangerous to try and immediately dismantle it. there meeds to be a long-term plan to transition that workforce into the new paradigm, whatever it is."
