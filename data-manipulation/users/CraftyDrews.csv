I’m in a group on Facebook called NAUK which stands for Network for AUtistic Women (Kvinder in my language), so I can see how the groups might be hard to find... maybe just search ‘autistic women’, join a big international group, and ask there if someone knows a group for your country/area.

HumansBeingBros,ff0apot,t1_fezt689,1579466936.0,"After having weekly or monthly appointments with a psychologists or psychiatrists from I was 16 to 19 years old for social anxiety, I asked my doctor if I would go to the psych-department on the hospital because it had only gotten worse in those 4 years. 

So shortly after I had turned 20 I got appointments at the hospital (still for social anxiety). After a few appointments I got asked if I had ever heard about autism. I hadn’t. My psychologist there was the first I met who knew about girls/women with autism and it took her only 4 appointments with me to see that my diagnosis and suspected other diagnosis was wrong. 

I had been to 3 different professionals and my own doctor before and non of them saw it, as I don’t fit in the (stereo)typical male with Aspergers “box”, and they didn’t knew enough about girls in the spectrum. Because it is a spectrum, and I’d most likely fail the criteria for Aspergers, because that’s not how I am.

Anyway, I talked with the psychologist and one of the doctors from the psych department, the doctor diagnosed me less than half a year after I first got there (the psychologist aren’t allowed to diagnose, if has to be a doctor or psychiatrist). 

So if you’re looking to get diagnosed make sure it’s by someone who knows about women with autism (if you’re female), otherwise they’ll likely dismiss it or not even consider it. 

There’s a lot of networking groups online (eg. on Facebook). Find a fairly local one and ask to their experience with psychiatrists. They’ll know which ones to avoid, which ones are meh, and which ones are good and knows a lot. Those groups can be really helpful with that part, and are usually happy to help others, even if you aren’t diagnosed (yet). 

I’d also like to apologize for the long read, but keeping it short isn’t my strongest side."

Girls with autism often comes off as shy and a bit quirky. We can be good at masking. We can use our intellect to compensate for most of the problematics that can some with autism. We can mirror behavior to fit in. We often get described as “not autistic, just quirky and shy”.

wholesomememes,fewcfsp,t1_few0alm,1579408342.0,"On days when I feel like this I think of this one girl on a summer camp where I volunteered. The second year I was there her parents came to me, and told how relieved they were that I was there again. Their daughter 8-9 at the time had been talking about me and asking if I would be there again FOR HALF A YEAR. And I didn’t really remember who this girl was. But I had made a world of difference to this girl. I spend lots of time with her that week, and the next year it was the same even though I did remember her this time. They won’t go this year (which the girl is sad about) so I exchanged contact info with her parents so she can come visit me in the summer or vice versa. 

It also turned out the girl is likely autistic (like me) and I’m the first person who really understood her, accepted her fully as she is and spoke to her as a person and not just as a kid. 

I also think of the young scouts who’s life I hope I make a difference in every week.

LifeProTips,feiv7za,t1_feic6hd,1579148115.0,"I’ve been rejected by ‘normal’ therapists for exposure therapy for social anxiety. The reason is that while it works with ‘normal’ anxiety disorders it doesn’t work the same for autism related anxiety. The difference is the cause. For autism related anxiety it’s the uncertainess and variables of eg. the socializing and being among people that makes one anxious. So that’s not something a brain will get used to by exposure. 

A therapist explained to me that usually when someone with eg. ‘normal’ social anxiety goes to a social gathering the anxiety will start to rise before going, peak around arrival, be high for a bit, but then begin to fall again. And that’s where exposure therapy will work. 

On the other hand when an autistic person goes to a social gathering the anxiety won’t fall as much or at all. This is because the uncertainties that is the cause of the anxiety is still there. “What do I do if someone talks to me?” “Am I dressed right?” “What if the food is something I can’t eat?” “Do I fit in/am I masking well enough?” together with an increasing stress from masking and sensory (over)stimulation. (Examples is some she used for my case, and may therefore vary). 

So while some things can be trained with exposure therapy it’s important to look at what things is ‘normal’ anxiety, and what comes from the autism. The part from the autism can’t be cured, but one can plan around it and compensate most times. 

‘Normal’ = not autism related.

Edit: I had just read a post on r/autism and thought I was still in that sub. Therefore all the taking about autism related anxiety vs. ‘normal’ anxiety. 
Sadly I’ve seen and heard about many with autism going through ‘normal’ therapy which have made things worse for them."

For me as a kid it was the tickling which lead to laughing that was fun in itself, but also some nice bonding and laughing with the other person. 

If it’s the same tickle game here in the test, it might have something to do with the responses to physical contact and the reactions to tickling."

Showerthoughts,fdhck11,t3_ekmc70,1578419948.0,"Among with babies not being thrown into fires, there are several other factors that may play a role. 

Population. We are so many more people now on the planet than there ever was before. Which means that there are more of everyone/everything in terms of the mental health spectrum, which also means more people with autism 

‘Autism’. The diagnosis is fairly new. It was at first thought to be some kind of childhood schizophrenia, and wasn’t established as a ‘pervasive developmental disorder’ and it’s own thing until the DSM-III was published in 1980 - which is only 40 years ago. 

Girls. The diagnosis criteria was in the beginning based on young boys. As it present itself different in girls/women it has been believed that autism only affected boys/men. As we have been getting a better understanding of what autism is more girls/women is getting diagnosed. When I got my diagnosis 3.5 years ago I was told the average diagnosis age for women was 23 years old! It means that LOTS of adult women is getting their diagnosis. Also women with autism is generally better than their counterpart at masking. 

Society. The world is changing - fast. That is hard for many with autism who has a need for sameness. Things changing can be unpredictable, and cause lots of anxiety for someone with an autistic brain. We also have a LOT of sensory input that wasn’t there just 50 years ago. This means that a lot more with autism get so stressed that they can’t function at optimally, which is when many start to get their diagnosis. For a lot of women this is when they can’t keep up their masking, and generally when you can’t compensate enough anymore. 

The spectrum. As many has already pointed out, autism is now a spectrum with all the ‘pervasive developmental disorders’ which means that the numbers has gone up from just looking at Aspergers, infantile autism, and atypical autism."
