On the other hand, it may have helped create more of a buzz. Do I think it contributed to the movie? Well, it shows you that Pitt's character is a solid, scrappy fighter who also gets himself into shit he could have avoided. This foreshadows his involvement and the resulting tension you feel at the Manson ranch, and also the scene with the Manson family during the climax of the  movie.
Could this have been showcases in some other way? Of course.
What was the motive behind Quentin wanting to show Bruce Lee getting beat? Is it to reveal to the audience that Hollywood hype and legend is sometimes bullshit? I think that's probably the reason.
It was a bold move, and honestly I think it was one of the more enjoyable scenes in the movie. As opposed to the many scenes of the characters just driving around without much exposition."

His editor really made some odd timing choices on this one. Things hung too long when it didn't add anything to the scene.  

There were long shots that really broke up the rhythm of the movie.  I don't know, I guess if you're from the west coast or L.A. this movie might satisfy based on the scenery and nostalgia then maybe it made up for it.  However, I just don't think it grabbed me like his other films.    
I think there was an element of this also in Hateful Eight, but it wasn't as egregious. The timing sort of fit with the desolate nature of the film's setting.  The L.A. story in Once Upon a Time though deserved something a little snappier."
