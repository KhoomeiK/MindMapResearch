I’ve been bad and using an old Iron Banner cloak with locked perks of sniper scavenger... even though I don’t snipe, because it looks good. Sigh. I also wear my Iron Banner old chest piece and legs most of the time because I like how it looks and then run sixth coyote in dungeons when I have to sit up and try to not die.

gaming,ffeud56,t1_ffe0zpe,1579865926.0,They have a cap of how much gamerscore a game can have- 1000. Indie games used to be less I’m pretty sure.
gaming,ffdzr2b,t1_ffdz4q2,1579832996.0,"I had to give up PB for him. I’m an angel. Yes, some people say that’s how pros eat burgers because top bun is thicker and can soak up more condiments and is more structurally sound? They’re crazy."
gaming,ffdzjzc,t1_ffdy6nw,1579832855.0,We do hunt achievements. Call of Duty sent us wedding gifts but we never got an achievement. Xbox twitter liked our portal wedding cake and tattoos though.
gaming,ffdyd0k,t1_ffdxe26,1579831989.0,I touched his tomatoes. Have you ever played Overcooked? It’s very serious.
gaming,ffdxc91,t1_ffdvau4,1579831258.0,But the carton leaves dried milk around the cap and the cap screwing on and off scratches the milk flakes off into your cup or on the counter and you use the same carton for longer. Three small bags mean fresher milk. I’m biased.
gaming,ffdsjkr,t1_ffdpvau,1579827841.0,Exactly. Squeaky kids like the shock value.
gaming,ffdsa9m,t1_ffdpb06,1579827667.0,Nope. First visit was 2015 and he came to Canada. Both single... also nothing happened. People can play video games on a couch together without it being sexual. Didn’t state anything romantic or feelings related until night he broke up with girlfriend in 2017.  Very “you had feelings? I had feelings!
gaming,ffdr8k2,t1_ffdnnrt,1579826971.0,He brings me coffee every morning... but I did have to give up peanuts and nuts for him... he’s one mistake away from getting kicked out of Canada and losing his “free” health care he just got. Hehe
gaming,ffdozrc,t1_ffdmh41,1579825557.0,"Yeah, very The Office - Jim, Pam and Karen situation.  Nothing wrong with Karen, she’s great, she just wasn’t Jim’s Pam.
Difficult to understand without watching whole series/hearing whole story."
gaming,ffdm0yj,t1_ffdddm1,1579823739.0,"Wait! He just brought me my dinner and the lettuce is on the bottom of my chicken burger and I remembered HE EATS HIS BURGERS WITH THE TOP BUN ON THE BOTTOM. He assured me it’s normal and then watching Supernatural, Dean Winchester eats his burgers like that too. Mind blown. Meeting strangers you met on Xbox can cause you to be married to a crazy person."
StardewValley,ffdkpdc,t3_esv8fp,1579822925.0,"I didn’t know this, I wouldn’t have ran screaming from my chucky lookin kid every time it ran in the room."
gaming,ffdjxre,t1_ffd8ird,1579822461.0,It’s called Xbox matchmaking though
gaming,ffdjp3y,t1_ffdih6a,1579822314.0,Yeah playing call of duty I had a friend that her internet wouldn’t support Xbox party so we used  ingame chat and would hear all the people on other team and Randy’s asking if I’m a girl. Then it was mostly just me and my now husband and we just stuck to party chat -invite only. I bug him that we will never make new friends and the whole reason we are together is because he joined my friend’s party and game after being on opposite teams in Gears and my friend called him a scrub and invited him. I came along when they got call of duty.
gaming,ffdj3si,t1_ffdi40k,1579821947.0,Yes! Exactly! I think the sub is so broad with s many different types of people that it’s hard to make everyone happy.
gaming,ffditoh,t1_ffdf2rm,1579821776.0,The way I see it is it IS embarrassing but love and friendship is getting to enjoy what you love and be embarrassing without being ridiculed for it.  Those people are awesome!
gaming,ffdiep5,t1_ffde7m4,1579821525.0,"Not first time! He was too nervous and shy and didn’t think he’d ever have a chance with me. Just best friends. 

Now though... so many Overcooked fights on the couch."
gaming,ffdhzpd,t1_ffdddm1,1579821271.0,"After being best friends for so long and messaging and being in Xbox party all the time there wasn’t really anything weird other than American vs Canadian things but we knew that before living together 
- he never separated cardboard recycling from metal, glass and plastic and never had an organics bin
- didn’t take shoes off inside
- EDIT -FLOSSES after brushing teeth
- says soy instead of soya, spells check instead of cheque, doesn’t put U’s in words like favourite, valour, labour. Didn’t know what Christmas crackers were and didn’t know about Boxing Day.
- MILK - bagged vs plastic carton"
gaming,ffdh6es,t1_ffdcyqj,1579820778.0,"Not intentional, though he did propose right before Crimson days and had to leave on a plane two hours later so we spent our time at nights playing crimson days doubles and recreated an old D1 picture as our “[engagement photo](https://twitter.com/zombree_03k64/status/1186768658179280896?s=21) and he wore dead orbit T-shirt to cut our portal wedding cake. 

We were deciding what date to book wedding and  it was June or July and I like sevens- born 27th, 87. Seven year age difference, met playing seventh Call of Duty title. Got matching seven tally tattoo for our first Valentine’s Day married... which turned out to be seven months after wedding.

gaming,ffdbzgi,t1_ffdbcg7,1579817636.0,They all look so happy and share passion for gaming. I love it. I’m happy they have such a nice social group.
