AskReddit,ffkv6j5,t3_ett7fr,1580029543.0,"Not realising what depression and anxiety were. 

When I was at university I had severe depression and anxiety leading to agraphobia so I didn't leave my dorm room for weeks and months on end without having panic attacks. I had no idea what was wrong with me because I had no awareness of mental health issues or how to recognise it articulate them, neither did my parents. It just kept getting worse and worse. It led to me missing out on uni life, sacrificing friendships, missing the boat on being independent and travelling when I was ""young"".

Gradually took me years to identify and recover, only to get into a relationship with some asshole who manipulated and abused me for years. I obviously didn't have the strength to stand up to him to leave him.

Eventually I did get the help I needed, left him, set up my own company, got a job I love, and built up my independence. It took 10 years to recover to the point now where I still have ups and downs, and me and my husband now still have to deal with a few of the effects of my poor mental health and the effects of an abusive relationship. 

But if id known how to recognise the signs (in the same way people recognise a sprained ankle and then work to rehabilitate), it could have been helped a lot sooner. Now I work a lot in mental health awareness for this exact reason!"
