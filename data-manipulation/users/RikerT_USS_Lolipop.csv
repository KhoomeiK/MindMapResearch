DaystromInstitute,ffra5vv,t1_ffr9m27,1580153787.0,"By Starfleet standards when you leave one you trip over the other. Remember the episode where Sisko sailed from Bajor to Cardassia? He set out to do it because it seemed possible. Getting caught in a warp speed current was a surprise.

Memory Alpha is saying 5.25 light years. And Wikipedia has this to say about Supernova:

> A near-Earth supernova is an explosion resulting from the death of a star that occurs close enough to the Earth (roughly less than 10 to 300 parsecs (30 to 1000 light-years) away) to have noticeable effects on Earth's biosphere.

Also:

> It is estimated that a Type II supernova closer than eight parsecs (26 light-years) would destroy more than half of the Earth's ozone layer."

DaystromInstitute,ffr9b92,t3_euq8ca,1580153259.0,You make great points. The only issue is that any Supernova that would destroy Cardassia would also obliterate Bajor as well.
mealtimevideos,ffr8xnd,t1_ffqw42t,1580153027.0,"> People don't like how rich he is. Personally I think any rich person who spends all their money on houses and stuff is fine. They're spending money and putting it back out there. They have to furnish said houses, more spending. They'll likely hire people to do the lawns, clean the homes, etc, more spending. All of that money is flowing out of their hands. So go on rich people and buy your fifth house. You deserve it.

This is an example of a Broken Window Fallacy. When rich people make a lot of money and don't spend it that's good because it removes that money from circulation. This would cause deflation which would be fine, except the government prints more money and spends it on things that actually help people and accomplish something. Building houses, filling them with junk, and nobody living in them is a complete waste of resources. Resources are limited and by using them on this the price of everything else goes up. 

Only in a perverse system could wanton waste be celebrated as a good thing.

worldnews,ffqtaer,t1_ffqlarw,1580143145.0,This phenomenon has been studied extensively. And not just Anti-Semitism but all forms of prejudice. Many universities have a Genocides and Holocaust studies program. The biggest issue is lack of integration. Subcultures want to hang on to their cultures and to do that avoid integrating. It's a perfectly reasonable desire but remaining an Other in an otherwise well mixed fluid society is a natural consequence. Jews famously do not integrate.
worldnews,ffqsp4o,t1_ffq45wh,1580142756.0,"This is what gets me. Germans have learned the lessons better than anybody. And not just superficial, Racism = bad stuff. They learn about human psychology, why it happened, how it could happen again. If you asked a random sample of American, British, Russian, or Italian adults, ""Why is racism bad?"" I doubt half of them could give you a reasonable answer. Germans really, actually, learn this shit."
worldnews,ffqrqtm,t1_ffqltde,1580142124.0,"No, religion is not the biggest contributor. Throughout history Jews have not integrated into the societies they find themselves in. That is what matters most.

We see the same thing today in the US. Black Americans have held resentment to the larger White culture of the country and have invented their own culture. Sometimes it's purposefully the exact opposite of whatever mainstream culture is, ie ""Why you always readin' and going to school? Why you tryna act White all the time?"" Other times it's art, language, music, dance and literature.

Do Blacks have a reason to resent Whites? I mean, holy fuck open a history book, god *damn*. But at the same time looking down on people for ""acting white"" is not helping. Acting white isn't even a real thing. White people just do whatever it is that might make them successful. Ask yourself what ""acting Asian"" might entail. I can't even think of anything a White or Black person could do that would result in someone saying, ""Why are you acting Asian?""

Similarly Jews who keep themselves separated from larger society in speech, dress, and practices are setting up their communities for failure."

When people say they want abs what they want are large abdominal muscles and a low bodyfat percent. To get that you have to eat at a surplus, build the muscles up, then cut the fat down with a deficit. It either takes a long time or you have to ride the razors edge during puberty.

No. I'm an impartial third party and it's obvious to me that an industry sprung up, believed they couldn't market Almond juice, and jumped on the name Almond milk. And now consumers are mislead about the nutritional value of their product.
