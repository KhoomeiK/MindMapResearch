AskReddit,ffulka1,t1_ffu0hpr,1580244518.0,"Please don't think you could have stopped your friend. If someone really wants to kill themselves, nothing will stop them. And it may be because of things you'll never know about.

I talked to someone suicidal. He has a kid. He thought his kid would be better off without him. Completely insane, as it would destroy his kid if he had done it. But at that moment, there was no logic. I told him flat out this will destroy your kid's life, and he couldn't see it. He loves his kid more than anything.

The point of all that is that you can grieve over the loss of your friend, but please don't feel like you could have stopped him. You don't need that, and it's probably not true. Peace."
