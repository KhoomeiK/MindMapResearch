You're validating my claim, though. Not vilifying. Just pointing out that in your previous comments with OP you came across as argumentative for no reason and close minded to a different perspective. 

You're getting worked up now. We can end the conversation here, I won't reply any further. Have a good day."
2007scape,ffir6is,t1_ffip4ju,1579980664.0,"Why use the term fixed mindset if you don't know what that means? It means you came into these comments with a narrow mind and engage in arguments here without the openness to admit fault or ignorance, just for the sake of arguing or boosting your ego. 

OP is noting that during your time logged on and playing, doing slayer or woodcutting, notifications don't impede or intrude on gameplay. You misconstrue what they've said just to argue and it's quite clear that's the case."

IAmA,fei8rcd,t1_feh1dn7,1579132808.0,"That's quite the analysis. You talk about me derailing conversations, but you still won't address my points.

Address them or don't bother continuing this conversation for the sake of both of us.

Edit: My real issue with what you've said beyond what's noted above, is that you assumed some sort of authority and decided for everyone what the right course of action is. You spoke on behalf of all homeless and any other stakeholders in this. You want to talk about begging for an argument? That's a good way to start one."

IAmA,feearsd,t1_fedy0cb,1579029916.0,"How can you begin to understand without a story, beyond undergoing it yourself, or something similar, which even then varies from another persons experience. 

It's certainly not a fair comparison here that you gave. It's an obvious disingenuous take to what OP is doing to serve your unrelenting bias on this manner. You say lack of understanding only leads to ignorance, but what you imply is that we should all try out homelessness to understand. How silly is that? It's effectively doubling down on this ignorance you claim, since you place an unfair decision on someone just to try to understand with good intentions. Instead, you should be encouraging storytelling, something natural and ingrained in people, through a respectful, responsible avenue. Perhaps OP's mission isn't the most ideal, perhaps it is. But to discourage seemingly sincere attempts is more harmful."

Met and stayed at a locals place for a few weeks, and he was obsessed with 21 Jump Street, the film.

It's a bit disappointing to see such close-mindedness on this, when even the fact we disagree on it indicates the existence of the debate and multiple, valid theories.

That's not an exaggeration, but perhaps I wasn't clear enough in my comment. While neuroscience is progressing rapidly, there isn't evidenced support that explores and discerns differences in consciousness, subconsciousness, how it works, its limitations, its possibilities, how it forms, how it repairs itself in trauma, how it differs in individuals, how bodily maladies effect it, etc.

Truth is relative, subjective, and objective, all depending on the content being discussed. There isn't even definitive science on consciousness, so I would be reluctant to so aggressively argue for something you're not quite aware of. Do you understand that the relationship between the mind and body is up for debate? There are some serious questions, terms, ideas, and premises to unpack before you start asserting baseless claims or resorting to trying to insult me, which I assume is nearing."
todayilearned,featd2w,t1_feas17u,1578952044.0,"But that's not a valid argument to the Earth's shape. Dualism is a valid, well constructed, well argued position that explores the mind-body relationship. In this perspective, the truth, or conclusion, is that the mind is separate from the body. 

Another truth, or conclusion, would be monism. This being opposite to dualism, it's supported premises discuss the idea that the body and mind are not separate entities. 

There exists dozens others on mind-body relationship schools of thought. My point being, just because you're a proponent of one, in this case a dualistic view, and believe this to be the truth for everyone, doesn't mean it is because there are other perspectives, other subjective truths."
