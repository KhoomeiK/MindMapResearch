Berserk,ffbjgxs,t1_ffb1w0z,1579768192.0,For just a few moments it is.  Schierke's smile for example.  Real shame they didn't just do all the anime like that.  The rest isn't even anime.
depression,ffbjcnr,t3_espun9,1579768027.0,"Thank you Johanne.  I am a man who also struggles with depression.  It is really hard to find the will to live sometimes.  I don't really know if this would help at all.  But if you ever feel like chatting on the phone with someone like me in particular, I would be down."
depression,ffbj2l8,t3_esq7a2,1579767640.0,It's a common comorbidity.  Haven't had that problem personally though
ShingekiNoKyojin,ff2mana,t1_femghdr,1579512992.0,"Good point.  But in that case, genociding the rest of the world is really the only way it seems.  You could also say that titanization has already been undone though, don't think anyone will change Ymir's mind back to slave mentality now."

depression,fexkco3,t1_fexjvjm,1579432393.0,It sure does.  I've never been called toxic and I think I hide my depression very well.  The result is the same.
depression,fexjozv,t3_equv3o,1579432084.0,"I'm a 30 year old in a similar situation to you.  I think it had a lot to do with luck.  Some people are just unlucky enough to be alone like us.  It must be about luck because nobody and I mean nobody can seem to understand or explain how this happens to a nice person.  At the same time, I can't understand how everything has come so easily to them except that there are some common factors they were predisposed to that I didn't happen to have.  Despite that, I don't think I should be alone, but I am anyway.  It really really really hurts in a way nobody understands that I just don't have the literal fairy magic they apparently believe in called ""connection"" or ""chemistry"" despite looking so long and working so hard.  I wish I could blame any one person, but I don't.  I blame my luck, but in that way I'm even robbed of a real enemy."
depression,fexi5mp,t3_eqt5u8,1579431395.0,I've had similar things happen to myself as well.  I have very good friends who are Christian theists.  But there's certain kinds of theists who simply can't be friends with anyone who isn't a theist because in their mind they should be able to give you a canned line and be done with it.  There's nothing friendly about that.
depression,fexhdnf,t3_equvx8,1579431036.0,"The most important thing for me is to just start doing it.  Even just start doing it in an extremely shitty way, eventually you'll get in the mode of doing it in a not so shitty way.

For you, it may be a combination.  You're probably young so you should be young while you can, make stupid mistakes and do your best for someone else while you're young and things may actually turn out better than you think.

OnePunchMan,feu7is4,t1_feu5aqj,1579383836.0,"I have indeed read OPM (webcomic).  Even if I hadn't, that's only half of S-Class.  And even if I hadn't, even that half doesn't preclude money being a factor for them.  And the half of that half it does make sense for seems contentious.  Pig God for example, could he really make more doing stunts and expositions?  Sounds like circus work, not sure that would pay as much or not.  Who says WDM can't use money?  Metal Knight sounds like he needs money most of all!"
OnePunchMan,feu29wy,t1_feskpe0,1579382408.0,"I don't think we really have any hero statements on whether they do or don't do it for the pay.  So what we have to ask ourselves is why the HA pays them if they would save people regardless.  Remember that Raiden of the Neo Heroes say the HA is corrupt, could money have something to do with it?  Who knows?


On the other hand, why don't the would be S Class heroes help out despite not being part of the HA?  Their incentive is that their planet will be destroyed or taken over, but really they probably expect HA to at least prevent that most of the time.  Yet they don't prevent minor threats from causing lots of havoc.  Same applies to many HA S class heroes anyway though.


I don't actually think it all comes down to money or fame either for that matter.  I'm just noticing big contradictions that can't be easily explained.  My personal opinion is that for one thing it's not meant to be that deep, but for another it could be possible that much like in the anime Tiger and Bunny there is some corporate influence in the background making things complicated especially for heroes like Genos and King who seem to be living somewhat simple lives."

The other problem is that the rightist media using every scare tactic of demagoguery, scapegoating and outright lies is captivating and rallying the general public into support.  I agree that the solution is not to blame people for being misled.  The problem is the rightist corporate mass media has all the tools and we have very few.  Sure, we need to make better and better and even better socialist indie websites and youtube shows, but I'm not sure it will be enough.
