politics,ffg0gar,t3_etbvdm,1579895781.0,"Cicero, urging the Senate to apply the laws equally in order to protect the reputation of Rome and to provide justice for the victims of a corrupt magistrate (1stC BC):

""You, when you have been besieged by so illustrious a city on account of your own wickedness and crime—when you have compelled men, miserable and maddened by calamity, as if in despair of our laws and tribunals, to fly to violence, to combat, and to arms—when you have shown yourself in the towns and cities of our friends, not as a lieutenant of the Roman people, but as a lustful and inhuman tyrant—when among foreign nations you have injured the reputation of our dominion and our name by your infamy and your crimes—when you have with difficulty saved yourself from the sword of the friends of the Roman people, and escaped from the fire of its allies, do you think you will find an asylum here? You are mistaken—they allowed you to escape alive that you might fall into our power here, not that you might find rest here."""

Chapó. I could not have expressed it better than you. It is precisely that: voters in general ignore what they do not like and keep what they want to hear, hoping that what they ignore will not be carried out or even directly or remembered."

No, they don't realize. It is impossible to understand, but they really do not understand that when Vox talks about “the herds” and so on, that for the average Vox voter there is no difference between the Sudacas and the Moors, they are all wild fucking who come to steal and rape and you have to kick them all out. Latinos who are with Vox believe that because they have been here for a long time they are already one more, they are already part of the community, what they do not understand is that Vox preaches the exact opposite: That the immigrant * will never * be part of the community and that Youssef el Marroquí and José el Ecuatoriano (and their children) are a threat to Spain. It doesn't help that much of this Latino community is on average much more conservative, so Vox tells them about the herds in the same speech that tells them about ending abortion and feminism, and they ignore the first part and stay with What they want to hear Is incredible."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffap2hi,t1_ff912l0,1579741155.0,">It is literally horrible. I also have a lot of experience with that. Two of my friends, who are brothers, and their parents vote for Vox and go to every meeting they do. Once Santiago Abascal came to my province and I went to see the panorama in a while I had between classes. They sang the song of the Legion taking out the flag, so far so good. The problem is that I recorded a video to laugh in class and I realized that there were quite a few people ahead of me that I couldn't see in person, but that in the video you could clearly see that they had their hands raised. As if that were not enough, I received a message from one of the two boys asking me what I was doing there, since it is obvious that I do not vote for that game. I replied that it was about hanging out, and he clarified that he was there with his brother and his parents because they loved the game and that was his atmosphere. OK. Both boys and parents ARE LATIN IMMIGRANTS. Do they not realize?"
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffaozr1,t1_ff90mta,1579741105.0,">Those are the parents of a colleague. They are Venezuelans who have been living here for about 20 years and * adore * Vox, they were voted in the two elections and they will continue voting. In that, Vox has been cunning, concentrating on sub-Saharan immigration, they have won over the right-wing Latino immigrants who believe that immigration has to end, but the immigration of * the others *, *** we *** came to work, * those * what come is to steal. It is horrible to listen to them. What in English they call the fuck you got mine made shape."
LeopardsAteMyFace,ffaotgn,t1_ff905s7,1579740990.0,">Worst of all is that there is a group formed by women, immigrants and people from the LGBT collective supporting the party because they do not believe that they will really apply the policies against them, but the one they like (which coincidentally goes against the others from that own group). In the end it is a sentence if you are not just as they want you to be."
