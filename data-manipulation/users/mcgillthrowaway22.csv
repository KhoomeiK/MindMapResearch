This is literally given as the reason that women were paid less in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign-sexism.html) article criticising Sanders for perceived sexism. And the article also mentions that a major issue with this is that the 2016 campaign was decentralised and thus information didn't spread correctly. Which is a flaw on Sanders' part in terms of running a campaign, but means he probably wasn't actually being told that many of these issues were happening."
