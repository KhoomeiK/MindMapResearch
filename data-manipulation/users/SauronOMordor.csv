todayilearned,ffngmtf,t1_ffmeeus,1580065700.0,"Sensory overload has absolutely nothing to do with extroversion or introversion. 

Sensory overload has to do with how a person's brain processes information from their environment. 

Introversion/extroversion has to do with how a person engages with their environment. 

Extroverts are naturally inclined to seeking stimulation externally, whereas introverts are naturally inclined to seeking stimulation internally. That's all those words mean. 

For an extrovert, engaging socially comes naturally and provides the mental and emotional stimulation that they crave. 

For an introvert, engaging socially requires a more conscious effort and the longer they maintain that effort, the more exhausted they become. 

A loud, busy space is probably a lot more distracting for an extrovert because they have to make a conscious effort to ignore the easily accessible external stimulation. 

An introvert, on the other hand, can probably ignore the distractions more easily as long as they're being left alone. It's when other people are constantly trying to engage with them that it becomes difficult and draining. 

It's not the environment, it's the level of interaction. 

People with sensory issues exist all across the extroversion-introversion spectrum."

hockey,ffn7ro1,t1_ffgu4hm,1580062903.0,"I wish I had known about them before the league folded. I would for sure have gone to games! But I had honestly never heard of them until it was all over the news that they won the championship as the league was folding. 

I honestly think the market for professional women's hockey is there and ready to be tapped, it just needs better promotion. A pro women's league that's properly promoted would do so much for girls hockey by showing girls growing up today that they can have a real future in the sport. 

My niece's all play hockey and watching women's hockey is a big deal for them. My brother and sister-in-law have started taking them to university games and stuff because that's the most elite women's hockey that is accessible to them right now. I can guarantee that if they had a pro women's team priced similarly to CHL tickets, they would go to lots of those games.

It would take some serious investment over the first 10 years to establish an active fanbase though, so it's unlikely to be successful without the backing of the NHL or at least the CHL leagues.

$750,000 is not a massive sum of money in the grand scheme of things, but if you receive a lump sum like that, it can be absolutely life changing *if you use it right*.  

Blowing such a large portion of it on depreciating assets and vacations right off the bat is a foolish use of that money. 

They should use that money to pay off their existing mortgage or, if currently renting, purchase a home in cash that they can afford to pay the property taxes and services for on their regular income. 

Doing so knocks off the largest monthly expenditure most people have, which puts them in a position where they now have a significantly larger amount of expendable income each month that can go towards savings for retirement and/or education as well as trips and toys that make life more enjoyable. 

Instead of using the money in a way that reduces their monthly expenses, they've spent it in a way that *increases* them. Brand new, $60,000 vehicles are more expensive to insure and maintain. What are they gonna do when the money dries up? Probably sell the vehicles for half of what they paid for them.

AskMenAdvice,ff18ct8,t3_eqwfcd,1579476242.0,"I gotta be honest here. Your thought processes throughout this whole thing are very... Strange. Dysfunctional even.

First, you seem really torn up over something that is really just not that important in the grand scheme of thing. So much so that instead of being able to learn from the experience and put yourself back out there, you're stuck licking self inflicted wounds instead. It's weird and doesn't strike me as particularly healthy. 

Instead of beating yourself up over screwing up one date with one guy, try to figure out what can be learned from that experience and apply those lessons going forward. Everyone does dumb shit sometimes. It's how we learn. Sitting here feeling stupid and letting your friends get in your head isn't helpful. 

The lessons I'd be taking away from this are: 

1. Don't text a guy for *weeks* and let yourself develop an emotional attachment or expectations before meeting him in person. Have one or two conversations over the course of a week or so and if you think you might be interested, ask to schedule a date. 

2. Be open and honest with how you communicate. You seem to be extremely passive in your communication  with potential dates, which is never a good look and never helpful. If you are interested in going on a date with someone, tell them that. Don't waste your time or theirs texting back and forth and waiting for him to make the move. That's silly and childish. 

3. Stop worrying so much about the opinions of random people. Why are you so worked up about the things this guy might say about you to people you don't know? Honestly? It doesn't matter. 

4. Stop putting so much stock in the ""advice"" of your friends. Their advice is ridiculous and unhelpful. If you feel something, tell the person those feelings are relevant to. There's nothing ""cheap"" about that (seriously, wtf does that even mean?) 

5. If you're literally SO busy that you can't make time for one date over the course of several weeks, and then have to show up utterly exhausted to that date when you're finally able to schedule it, perhaps you just shouldn't be dating at all right now. It just isn't realistic to expect to be able to get to know someone and develop a relationship with them if you are only able to make time once every few weeks."

I do agree that in order to heal, a person needs to find ways to let go of the hurt and the anger, and in some cases that can include forgiving the person who hurt them, but often it simply means removing those people from your life so you can get them and their influence over you out of the way. 

It takes a big person to choose to take an active role in the growth of someone who hurt them in the past, and I applaud those who choose to do so, but not if they are doing so at the expense of their own health and well-being.

You do not owe your sister anything. Your number one priority needs to be your health and well-being. If you're not in a place where you feel it would be beneficial to *you* to reconnect with her or hear what she has to say, you're making the responsible choice by saying no. 

You've been through significant trauma, which was precipitated by her actions. It's neither unreasonable or irrational to not want her in your life. 

It's not about what's ""fair"" to her. It's not about what she wants or thinks she needs, or what your friends thinks she's owed. If she has grown and changed, that's good and you can be happy for her without letting her back in your life if it is too painful for you. 

But if she has truly changed and she truly understands the damage she did to you, she will understand and accept that your relationship with her is not salvageable and not something you're willing to put yourself through. If she doesn't understand that, she hasn't changed enough to make it worthwhile to give the relationship a chance anyways. 

The last thing you need is to invite her back into your life  only to have her begin pushing your boundaries and making your feel guilty for having them. She doesn't get to demand or even expect forgiveness, and if she does feel entitled to your forgiveness, that simply shows that she still hasn't developed the level of empathy that would be required in order for the two of you to have a healthy relationship.

AmItheAsshole,fetk2l1,t1_fes5iv2,1579376214.0,"See, and I think it's just logical to pick a concrete measure to determine who ""gets"" to be in family photos rather than trying to assign value to each individual relationship every year. 

At least this way, they can apply the exact same criteria to everyone without making it personal. 

I can't imagine how hurt I would be if my IL's partners were allowed in the photos because the family believed their relationship was more likely to survive, but I wasn't allowed in because for whatever reason they didn't think we'd make it or they didn't like me as much or whatever. 

But if they told me I could not be in any family pictures because we are not married, but the married partners are allowed in, I'd be fine with that. 

And if we decided as a couple that we had no intention to ever marry, I'd perhaps try to discuss it with the in-laws and see if there were any steps we could take as a couple that would help them feel more inclined to view our relationship as equal to the married ones, but if they were firm on their rule but respectful about it and generally kind to me, I'd accept it as just one of the trade-offs we have to expect by making that decision."
AmItheAsshole,fetgy2r,t3_eqf0v4,1579375337.0,"YTA

I understand why you felt hurt l those years when you were being excluded, but there is nothing wrong with them deciding that marriage is where they draw the line in the sand with regard to who they consider ""family"" for the purposes of family photos. 

It may not be where you personally would draw that line, and it may in practice have turned out not to work the way it was intended, but that doesn't make it wrong. 

And at least by using marital status as the determining factor in who goes in the photos, they were able to apply that fairly, across the board rather than making the decision personal to each individual. 

I mean, wouldn't it have felt much worse if they didn't have a hard rule about it and instead decided one of those husband's was included, but you and the other one weren't? Or to never include spouses at all? Or to decide after the first divorce not to include any future spouses? 

There's just not really any way of drawing that line that doesn't have the potential to cause hurt feelings, so it makes sense to make it an impersonal, general rule that is applied equally to everyone. 

Anyways, that said, even if they were kind of rude about it at the time, it's in the past and you're being needlessly petty and antagonistic. The fact that your wife said you pull this every year is pretty telling.

Pure capitalism stifles economic mobility and inevitably leads to inequality that grows larger with each generation.

rant,feskosw,t1_fes1bj5,1579366222.0,"You don't have to ""accept"" them or their urges, but from a practical standpoint, reducing the stigma and encouraging non-offending pedophiles to seek help, stay in therapy, and participate in research, will almost certainly yield better results than continuing to demonize people simply for having thoughts and urges they do not want to have and know are wrong. 

We need to judge people based on their actions and intentions, not on the very worst thoughts and urges they have. Often, people who develop these urges were abused or witnessed abuse as children. It isn't their fault that they have those thoughts and urges. 

If these thoughts and urges are distressful for them and they are committed to controlling them, we should encourage them to seek the help they need. 

If someone only ever hears that people like them are inherently evil, cannot be changed, cannot be trusted, etc., they will internalize those messages and feel powerless to control or overcome their urges, which could make them more likely to offend."
rant,fes6r03,t1_ferqc2a,1579361995.0,"I think they're talking about digital/illustrated CP, where it doesn't involve any actual children. 

I'm really not sure what the right answer is with regard to how to address those kinds of images. 

On the one hand I think, well maybe if that type of thing becomes more common and more realistic, that will lead to fewer children being abused for the purposes of creating CP. 

On the other hand, my concern is that looking at any images that sexualize children may feed the disturbing thoughts and urges rather than relieving them. 

I guess the question comes down to whether these images are more like methadone to a recovering heroin addict - in which case there may be value in these images for people in therapy to control and/or overcome pedophilic urges - or whether they're more like someone with an alcohol problem thinking they're fine because they quit everything but beer. 

I doubt that the quality of digital imagery could really have much impact on the amount of abuse that occurs though, because the people who produce those images probably aren't doing it just to satisfy the demand for it. They're doing it because they enjoy abusing children in that way. 

I dunno, I think it should probably be illegal just like real images are, but perhaps it could be allowed within the confines of a treatment plan for non-offending pedophiles *if* mental health professionals that specialize in this particular area determine there to be any value in it, and only if the individual is essentially prescribed those images as part of their treatment by a registered psychologist or psychiatrist."

Advice,ferv7to,t3_eqgael,1579358647.0,"You absolutely can and should report this, but I know it isn't that simple and I would not judge you for choosing not to. 

I wish it was as simple as ""person committed violent crime against me, I report them"", but the truth is there will very likely be social fallout from this and it is up to you to decide what is best for your mental and emotional health. 

I can't claim to know what it's like to be a male victim. I know there are nuances there that as a woman, I just can't understand. But I can tell you as someone who was raped and did not report it, it's ok to prioritize your well-being. 

If you choose to report, be proud of yourself because that takes incredible strength. 

If you choose not to, please don't let anyone make you feel guilty for that decision. It is yours and yours alone. 

I'm sorry you were hurt and that you are struggling. This kind of violation is difficult to process and can leave lasting damage. I hope that regardless of what your choose to do legally, you will seek some professional support to help you process and heal from this. I waited over a decade before I started talking to a professional about it - please don't do that.

ETA: I agree with others here suggesting a visit to the Dr as well. Tell them exactly what happened. You need to be tested for STIs and by telling them what happened, you'll at least have a paper trail somewhere should you continue to struggle with the decision of whether to report. They may also be able to give you some advice re: mental health support and may perform a rape kit to help with any potential legal proceedings."

It's understandable that your bio-bro wants to meet you and develop a relationship with you, and it is certainly not wrong of him to contact you and make that request. 

However, you do not have any moral obligation to accept the request and it's is both healthy and perfectly acceptable for you to choose not to meet him if you are concerned that doing so could negatively affect your well-being. 

You don't need to open that door if you don't want to, but you do need to communicate your decision respectfully, and be very clear about the extent to which you may be open to meeting him later on down the road. 

Don't give him false hope by telling him no ""for the time being"" if you don't see yourself changing your mind in the future. 

But if part of you is interested and you don't want to close that door entirely, you're just not comfortable with it at this time, you can be honest with him about that. Just be careful not to mislead him. 

You would be TA if you let him assume that your answer is ""no for now"", when it is most likely ""no, entirely"". It would be better to tell him no and end up changing your mind down the road than to tell him maybe and let him get his hopes up only to hurt him by telling him no again in the future."

Because you're doing well in school and seem to have no emotional response to the idea of reducing or quitting your videogame usage, say your habits are not anywhere close to what I would call an addiction. But it could be worth experimenting a bit with switching up your activities a bit more just to shake the default tendency to go straight to videogames when you're bored or need to relax.
