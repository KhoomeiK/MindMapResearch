The idea is that you're supposed to spend one THIRD of your income on rent, MAXIMUM. Because you WILL have other expenses.

RimWorld,fed9gul,t1_fed3xhl,1579004651.0,"I do place doctors on night shift as soon as possible. My primary reason for doing so is to help keep colonists alive because doctors will never automatically wake up to tend a patient, you have to poke them by drafting and undrafting.  


Doctor: Tending is at '1', bedrest is at '2'  
Patient: Bedrest is at '1', nothing else ranks higher.  


It's surprising to see that sometimes even three doctors can't be enough to keep patients adequately fed and medicated. I've even experimented with locking the doctors into the rooms with the patients, having food right in the prison and in the hospital, meds right there of course. Everything helps. I now start out all treatments on blue meds instead of herbal and I will sometimes cycle patients through a hospital bed if they've only got one.  


Once I have a doc with passion and level five medical skill, I have them treat simple wounds with the DeSurgeries mod so that they can hit level 10. If even the slightest thing goes wrong with tending a sick colonists, they're going to die. Medical rooms are at '0' cleanliness, 'feed patients' and 'feed prisoners' is set to priority 1 or 2 for almost all of my colonsits since hunger influences recovery time.  


I do keep my bases covered.  


One thing I haven't tried yet is just doing medical caravans with quality bedrolls. I believe that doctors DO 'wake up' to treat patients in caravan mode. A prison would not be necessitated, although mental breaks still happen. I think the 1.0 update might have even made entertainment objects automatic in caravan mode which are used when resting? Would the colonists entertain themselves in bed? Maybe.

It's frustrating that the game punishes human error so severely. If another event happens and you forget to check on patients even for a few minutes of game play, that might be all it took to put a patient on the path of death.  


Once patients have lost recreation and are in severe pain, avoiding breaks is pretty difficult. I am challenging myself by playing on 'rough' instead of 'normal' difficulty. Doing so requires you to improve all of your strategies and play style.

One has an obligation to the truth that is every bit as serious and as special as one's obligation to religion.  


The general argument on being forceful falls apart because the goal is the truth. For everybody. Getting there can be painful and ugly, and that's actually ok.  
If you're effective, the ends justify the means.  
""My ignorance is as good as your knowledge of the truth."" - No, it isn't. The truth is the truth. The only thing that matters is facts that are true, not things that simply feel true because of unchallenged ignorance.  


Atheists are very non-forceful compared to religions people. For example, if a kid decides they want to learn about theism, meh, the parents aren't likely to take that as a serious threat and then kick that kid out of the house.  


But religion... that tears entire families apart and the ignorance is crazy, going beyond the good book. For example, a bishop would ask a 15 year old girl who was raped if she enjoyed it. This is an important part of knowing the sin and knowing how much she needs to repent. Would that really happen? Yes, yes it did. In my own family.  


My mother was in on it, telling her she was asking for it by dressing in a two piece bathing suit. My father was in on it by telling her she had sinned because bad things don't happen to good people, so she should feel guilty and accept the divine punishment of the lord, even if that punishment is rape.  


Yeah, religion kiddoes... it's some totally bonkers shit and the thing is that you can't realize how wrongly people are behaving until your out of the religion. Most of my family left our church. Decades later, the damage is still with us. If we were all atheists from the beginning, then we would have had much more rational thought. We would have treated each other with greater love, fairness, and care.  


Our ideas about god and divinity lead us to behave in ways that are now recognized as child abuse. Yeah, story's not over... She was ultimately kicked out of the house, entirely rejected by those who are supposed to love her the most and without condition.  


Religion is what taught us to hate. Now before anyone lectures and says, ""but love the sinner, hate the sin..."" - No. That's not how it works. Religion it absolutely a hateful thing. I speak from experience. I nearly served a mission for the Mormon church. Leaving all that behind was one of the scarriest things I ever faced because I thought I was messing up my eternity and the idea of there being no god changed everything in my life because religion always had to come first.

Women leave men because of money all the time. That's the number one reason that men get really nervous about high earning women. It's not because we need some kind of male ego where my dollar is bigger than yours. It's because we know how women behave in those situations. I.e. we're not worried about us, we're worried about you. If a guy says he married someone who's got a lot of wealth or power, his male friends are going to kind of cringe and be like, ""oooh. Hope that works out for you in the end."" We know. We know. Everybody in the room is bracing for it.  


Women behave totally differently, and they treat men totally differently based on their social status in relation to the man.

There's a reason why there's a trope about marrying the earner, but fucking the hot pool boy behind his back. But in this situation, both men are actually losers and being manipulated by her wants. You don't want to be the rich guy she's chasing, but you also don't want to be too far below her because she's never going to be serious with the pool boy. She's serious with neither. Only a woman can pull that off.

Men, hide your wealth and also avoid women who are out of your league. The only way a woman is going to respect a guy and show loyalty is when they have some kind of parity in social value. E.g. I'm a doctor, you're a dentist, close enough. If you're a pool boy, you better be dating a pool girl because otherwise she's going to end up using you. Men get used by women all the time."

A lot of his theories didn't pan out, however the same can be true for the grandfather of psychology. The reason why he's so important is because be brought awareness and illumination to things which desperately needed it. With the right kind of awareness, capitalism can be good and OK... but that is ONLY possible if you education in capitalism includes devastating critiques of it.  


Marxism is about the people, the people, the people. And the US declaration of independence starts with 'We, the people"" - We fought off a king with our own uprising. In doing so, we inspired an era where other countries did exactly the same thing, becoming democratic in the process, all for socialist values.  


We can say that communism failed, but we can also say that capitalism is in the process of failing, and the most successful countries in the world are switching to socialism through experimenting to find out what works best and what actually IS best for 'the people'.  


In the same way that people worship Ayn Rand even though she didn't know shit about politics, government, good business, or the economy... she still had ideas that critiqued capitalism in ways that it needed, in ways that nobody else was thinking. She ultimately didn't have any answers, but she did have good questions... and that has played a part in molding the minds of national leaders.  
Bottom line, sometimes even if you're dead wrong with your ideas, the fact that you played a part in an important ideological debate will have resulted in a profoundly positive impact. By studying ideas that were wrong, people learn how to be right. While studying revolutionary thought and values, they're also going to gain some sympathy for the plight of the masses.

This story is a beautiful example that could be used to train business owners and customer service reps.  


The process that people go through is very important. You don't do unexpected work without talking first. Even when decisions are standard practice or obvious decisions, you still need to walk the customer through it because it's their decision to make. You don't do extra things that haven't been agreed to because that would violate permission. The customer is in control and gets to call the shots. As a business, you're going to educate the customer and make the right shots together.  


That process and togetherness creates a bond of trust and respect. Doctors, dentists, and medical professions of all types have 'bedside manner'. They study it and develop it. However it's not just for the practitioners, it's for sales reps too and it extends into every industry where decisions get made, such as auto shops.

However, that would require the government to own collateral, and that's not an efficient way to make economies work. A debt based economy allows greater investments and profits for everybody. It just needs to be well controlled."
interestingasfuck,fd1ondt,t3_ejfbm9,1578134375.0,"There's a lot of videos like this one that all say the same thing.  


But I gotta ask, how much is the fed actually paid for printing money? If you print a dollar and say that you're owed back nothing, then there's no profit to motivate you to print that dollar. The fact that it's printed at interest, is weird as hell.  


Goldsmiths that made coins used to have a deal similar to this: We give you X amount of gold, you keep 1% for yourself. I.e. it's a fixed rate, not yearly interest.  


Currency/money works, and these words do mean the same thing. This dude's going conspiracy theorist on us. Anyway, it works, we need it, someone needs to make it, and they need to be paid for making it. The government needs to decide how much gets made. That's why the 'debt ceiling' actually does matter, a lot. Through a democratic process, it is decided where we'll draw the line.  


It sounds like black magic fuckery how the goverment and fed and banks move money around to create it, however each step is part of a process which involves accounting. It's important to know that nobody is cheating, have good books, etc.  


It's disingenuous to say that fractional reserve lending was created for the purpose of making money out of thin air. The real deal is that there's laws so that your local bank doesn't just say, ""ok, we're going to loan a bazillion to everybody and just see what happens."" - That's related to the Black Friday event where everybody wanted their cash back from the banks because the economy was crashing. The banks didn't have any money because they'd been loaning money they didn't have. You can still loan money you don't have, but you're checked at 10%, which is extremely generous. This cap stops banks from overextending themselves.  


 These videos always state that the interest is profit... but when was the last time that the national debt was completely paid off? When? Never. Oh yeah, never. So how can there be a profit if this interest has NEVER been collected? We did have a balanced budget under Clinton, but that's pretty much the only time in the history of the nation. I think what's really going on is that the interest is so small that borrowing heavily actually puts the government ahead by growing the economy.  


If you had the choice between borrowing a million each year to start a business that earns 100k every year, and the interest is low enough... it makes sense to borrow again every single year because you're earning more than your borrow. Let it not be forgotten that the government taxes citizens and businesses. Any time spending happens, trickle down happens, and then taxes happen every single time someone buys or sells something. The government can't lose.  


The system benefits the government, the people, and the fed as well.  


If the government doesn't invest, this is putting future generations in debt?  
Nah. If the economy is strong now, and grows stronger every year, that's an investment so that future generations will have workers that are paid well because there is demand for their labor.  


I've watched DOZENS of videos exactly like this one. It's easy to be convinced that they're correct. However, they gloss over really important details such as how much profit the Fed is actually taking in. Why isn't the chairman of the Fed richer than Bill Gates? Why do they NOT just print money and give it to their friends, and quite literally ""buy the world""? - Because that'd be illegal and it's bad policy. The goal is to have a good economy.  


Now, what ought to be changed? I think that we need to end the fed, and have the government print its money directly and with processes that are more transparent. There's no reason that anyone should be getting rich by printing money and controlling banking rates. That should be a small time political career job, nothing too special or opulent.

Nobody cares if China picks up 'scientific knowledge' from the West. What we're pissed off about is that they are stealing 'intellectual property'.  
These are completely different things, and this dude is confusing the two.

  
For example, if Chinese learn how to make their own cellphones, that's fine. But if they make ripoff iPhones, there's going to be a problem.  
The IP theft has been out of control with them stealing military secrets, trade secrets, etc.  


They make their own version of Facebook, then block [Facebook.com](https://Facebook.com) (They'll do this for any popular website, product, good, or service.)  


They know it's theft. That's why they hide it. That's why they have teams of hackers trained to break in to corporate databases so that they can replicate exact products.  
If they were to design and make their own products, that's fine. But they aren't doing that, they're stealing blueprints, trade secrets, formulas, design schematics...  


Google it, there's plenty of examples. One that I remember is:  


They did this in their aircraft design industry. The latest developments and plans for jet propulsion results in a new jet engine that is copyrighted, it is intellectual property, it is protected and should not be stolen. What do they do? Suddenly, they're makings jets with the engines that WE designed... but taking this a step further, we NEVER sent any of that information TO China. We didn't want to. No part of those jets was made there. So how did it get there? It was stolen. The hack was traced. People follow the money and the trail of clues. What do they find? Government sponsored groups of hackers were involved in stealing that information. The company making the same engines in China has government ties. Most big Chinese companies do, but that's just part of how things operate over there. The government exercises a lot of control and coordination by having stooges on every board.  


Straight up at the highest levels of government, IP theft has spies, hackers, and groups running programs to systematically steal as much as possible. Imagine if the USA was caught red handed with groups that are funded with millions of dollars to conduct economic espionage to steal from our allies. China has done EXACTLY that with with of the most coordinated, well funded, and successful spy campaigns in world history."

AskReddit,fcvnkqe,t3_eixc75,1578005959.0,"I've sent over 6,000 personalized messages to women. This has taken over 2,000 hours of time. The result was lots of ghosting, lots of one word or one sentence replies to multiple paragraph introductions. I've rewritten my profile over 20 times and tried everything from bad-boy to good-boy.  


Got a few dozen dates. The change of a date (if you're a man) is literally less than 1%.  


The situation is that women often get over one hundred introductory messages per day, while men typically get less than one per year, (no matter how nice their pictures are or how their profile is written).  


In short, no, online dating doesn't work. At least not for men. In addition to women really not giving a shit or making a sincere effort, a man is put into a situation which really devalues him. Suddenly, you better be rich, tall, physically fit, and perfect in every single way... because she's literally being approached by at least 50 other men every single day of the week. There's no way to compete with that.  


Eventually, I got turned off of all dating in its entirety. The apps where you swipe right or left compounded an online dating problem that started decades ago. This explains a lot of what's wrong with women and their attitudes toward men, relationships, making a sincere effort, taking men seriously. All of it. Men became highly disposable and easily replaceable. The value that one man can have is pretty low. It doesn't matter what he says, how he behaves, etc.  


Things magically change for women in their mid to late thirties, because they lose their attractiveness. Suddenly, for the first time in their life, they have to actually try to get the man. They have to behave respectfully. The supply dries up and they don't get 50+ messages every day. Suddenly, men are less interested in sex, and they have to offer something substantial like a nice personality, the ability to make others laugh, etc. They find themselves, for the very first time in their life, doing things like paying for a meal, giving a small gift, reaching out and making a phone call instead of expecting the man to do all the work. They get their first taste of equality and it really messes with their psychology and ideas about self worth.  


When women are still young and have a high value on the sexual marketplace, they get unlimited sex, unlimited men, instantly. All they have to do is say yes to one out of dozens of guys that message them every single day. They get addicted to the perfect, crazy, super emotional and strong honey moon phase of relationships. It's almost like porn stops a man from being interested in sex because he can look at beautiful women any time he wants and then he gets super picky and can't find his girlfriend or wife attractive anymore. Well, how are men supposed to be attractive when they get thrown out every few months for a new guy that's going to be super interested and super attractive just because he's totally new and undiscovered?  


Women get the same thing going on. Their standards go through the roof and become completely unrealistic. They become really impatient with men in their lives while developing an extreme sense of entitlement. There's this idea that men are universally on a conquest to romance women and get them into bed, then go to the next woman, because it's frat-boy cool to have a high sex count. Some guys do that, but it's actually super-rare. What's actually going on is women have these men, then quickly dispose of them. Next in line!  


They have unlimited choice. You can see the psychology at play in women's profiles. After they have two children from different baby daddies and gain a lot of weight, they STILL post things like lists of arbitrary requirements like money, height, race, etc. They still think they can pick and choose even when any man that chooses them ends up with bastard children that won't respect him as their father, and a wife that's going to be ultra-financially dependent as well as extremely needy of his resources and attention because she has kids. She won't have time to be available to him for romance, love, and happiness because he's taking on a second full time job with her. But you'll see that aire of entitlement in her profile where she's going to be super-picky and have ultra-high standards about her men. She might straight up be insulting men in her profile. And they can get away with this, because they still get dozens of messages per week. It's down from 50 per day, but men are still THROWING themselves at these women.  


Modern men have no value on the dating marketplace, and women hold all the cards. It leads to women treating men poorly. Men became second class citizens."
