flask,ffi9ldd,t3_etoqtk,1579968592.0,"I would recommend it, especially if you're looking for the Swagger/OpenAPI style docs and to take advantage of python's async capabilities. 

I used to use [ApiStar](https://github.com/encode/apistar#where-did-the-server-go), but the author changed direction quite a bit. The author built another tool called [starlette](https://www.starlette.io/), which I really like and I am using.  I'm currently using starlette.config for a non-web app. FastAPI is heavily inspired by ApiStar and it wraps Starlette  for the web framework and [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) for the modeling/validation/strong typing.

I know that sounds like a history lesson, but what I'm trying to say is that you should spend some time reading Starlette's and Pydantic's documentation. I think FastAPI is really slick and intuitive, but if you dive into FastAPI directly, you may find yourself confused by things the author assumes you know about either Starlette or Pydantic. You might want to make some one-off playground code with just Starlette or Pydantic.

On a side note, I started a new command line app recently using Pydantic models. Models are not just for databases. I love it and can't imagine not using that method moving forward. I am no longer passing dicts around between functions. In a package, I define a data model (with validators) and that is one gets passed around.

HamRadio,ff2wa1f,t1_ff0mcb3,1579526564.0,"To get started ""just to see"", you can get APRSDroid and use it entirely on the internet. Then connect via the cable to your radio and see local traffic.  It's really fun getting two phone+radios setup and turn off your wifi/data to pass messages back and forth. You can do that on either 144.39Mhz, or tune to almost any other simplex frequency not in use.

One tip: set phone into DND/silent mode when connected via audio cable. Any app making noise will key up your radio, so you want to minimize the possibility of notifications and ringtones going out over the air.

The ""next step up"" from the audio cable is a [mobilinkd](http://www.mobilinkd.com/). This bumps your cost up of course. The TNC2 is about $65 and an audio cable (from the TNC to your radio) will be around another $20. With this, you keep it attached to the radio (many use a rubber band method) and your phone talks to it over bluetooth serial. This is nice in that you can set your radio in a good location, but you can freely move around in a 20-30ft bluetooth range. 

Then the big step above that is the [ArgentData Tracker4](https://www.argentdata.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=200). This may be overkill if you'r just looking for basic message sending, but depending on your budget, may be worth skipping the mobilink and going to this. This is a fully standalone unit with GPS and wifi. It can be attached to a radio, whether handheld or mobile and run whether your phone is around or not. It can be your igate, your digipeater, vehicle tracker, and you can still connect a smartphone to it within wifi range. Now when you phone is using this for wifi, the wifi won't have internet; however most android phones are smart enough to detect this and still pass data over 4G. 

There are some other options. You can find these all-in-one trackers, and some all-in-one radio+tnc+bluetooth devices on ebay, but most of these are 0.5W. Then there are the dedicated radios like HRO was trying to sell you. I have the Kenwood TM-D710G. It has APRS+GPS built in. When I'm driving down the road, I can see other APRS stations show up right on the screen. You can ""text"" with it, but text entry is slow - you need to spin the dial to select each letter. You can connect a PC to it with a special serial cable on the back (and I have made a serial to bluetooth adapter from ebay parts). So it's a nice setup for mobile, but you do definitely get more use out of it if you have it connected to a smartphone/tablet/laptop."
HamRadio,ff23z5f,t3_er3jk1,1579493166.0,"If you transmit from one the ""good"" radio to the deaf one, does it receive in that frequency? That would be the first test. If these are commercial frequencies you're not licensed for, maybe set the power low and try it in an underground iron mine.

Next, I always caution people about cloning baofeng radios. The firmware changes frequently and cloning can lead to a radio that either won't transmit or won't receive. The site miklor.com has some descriptions of this behavior and suggestions on fixing it. 

When I'm programming a batch of radios, I export the frequencies to a csv file. Then I read each radio, import the frequencies, tweak the config options by hand, then write back to the radio."

sysadmin,feybryc,t1_fewr4pu,1579443409.0,"Also agreeing with this. Even if you can't get all new, get some new gear into the new DC, setup bridge VPN networking (or MPLS if you can). Then start migrating services and data to the new gear. Consider it a gradual process of turning up the new datacenter as you work on turning down the old one. Switching service from a server in site A to site B can be done during a window, if it fails, you can roll back. 

Once you get one of your existing servers switched over, you can decommission it from the old DC and physically move it to the new one. Migrate the service over first, then the hardware. 

As you go along, you will almost certainly find room to improve the current way your services are setup and how you deploy them. You might be able to consolidate down to a smaller number of servers or even reduce the number of services you have.

NOTE: Since you OP didn't say what is running on the servers, I spoke from an OS-on-bare-metal approach. If in fact OP is running VMs or containers, this can go a lot smoother. For instance, in VMWare/vcenter VMs, just spin up new ESXi hosts in the new DC, get connectivity, and vmotion over. Due to storage latency it won't be a hot transfer, but definitely doable. If the new servers don't have shared storage, you can set them up with local for the duration of the move. This is often referred to as a ""lifeboat setup"". You might setup a lifeboat cluster in your current datacenter, migrate essential services to that, then move your SAN and other ESX hosts."

The biggest problem people have with homebrew repeaters is shielding, insufficient isolation from a cheap duplexer, and duty cycle. In most cases, it is the duty cycle. In a ""proper"" repeater setup, you want your transmitter to be operating at lowest possible power to give it the longest possible life, then you feed that into a power amplifier. Most people save money by skipping the PA, run their transmitter radio at full power, and overheat their radio every time their repeater gets busy. But even if you skip the PA and run your transmitter at the lowest power setting, you can still prolong life quite well."

If you want to access your self-hosted stuff while at home, a home server makes a lot of sense. It doesn't depend on your internet connection at all.

I've used these rest apis to help do cable validation. Understanding these and a bit of programming, you can provide a self-service portal. When we would be deploying racks of new servers, we would always have to bug network to check a port for link, it's port profile applied, any mac addresses it sees, and maybe to bounce a port.

I was working on a spreadsheet with balances only and I was also wanting to capture my savings/contribution rates, which you're doing on the ""In"" tab. I actually am not concerned about budgeting so much as tracking savings vs spending. So I think I'm going to use your sheet as a base over the other one I worked on in December. I did input my balances for each month in December, so I will probably go and backfill those (though I would have to fill in my paycheck contributions as well for the savings rate).

A couple comments/observations:

1. On your dummy sheet you put in negative numbers for debt, but on the blank copy, we need positive numbers because = Net WorthQ5: does a subtraction instead of an addition. It's fine either way, but it just threw me a bit.
EDIT: I saw in the dashboard and others that we want negative debt numbers, so I fixed the formula in Net Worths Q column.
2. I don't like only having one debt column. I like to break it between long-term and short-term debt. This distinction could be arbitrary (people often tie it to prime apr), but in my case it's 5% is long-term, while anything higher than is short-term (credit card/revolving debt). My only exception is a student loan debt, some portions of which are 6.8% I setup a separate sheet just for debt (actually I copied in the one I had been working on). Then on your sheet's Net Worth, I had the Debt cell sum up all the debts on my sheet. I'll probably poke at splitting debt between two columns, but I thought you might be interested in splitting that column up as well.
3. I liked that you put HSA on this. I hadn't even included HSA in my balances report, an oversight on my part. In fact, I even have some of my HSA invested, so I'm even considering two HSA columns.
4. (Added in EDIT): Have you tried this at a multi-year level? I'm planning to go back and fill 2019 in to give me a better view. I've backtracked a couple months and it seems to work, but not sure how it will look once you have many months in place. Is the deisign to create a new sheet each year (ie, copy 2020 in to 2021 and clear values)?"

selfhosted,fcu3f16,t1_fctwejt,1577971411.0,"Good docker containers just the their application, and you would run a separate container with Apache/nginx/traefic that handles your http ingress. Even php apps in docker should be running under php-fpm (or similar lightweight solutions).

That said, devs first learning to package their app in docker often go the all-in-one route, treating it more like a lightweight VM. Better are when they learn to separate their app from the webserver and move to a docker compose file with the separate web server container, the database container, and the app container. Then someone looking to set it up in their own environment can tie the app container into their existing ecosystem"

selfhosted,fclxux4,t1_fcjlii9,1577759132.0,"I've been using CiviCRM for about a year now for my radio club. Not sure what OP's use case is, so I can't recommend/not-recommend it. For a non-profit organization that wants to track memberships, it works pretty well. My use case is to get our membership list off of the spreadsheet and into a self-hosted webapp. I was also able to setup a report that emulates the ""membership list"" that I used to print out and distribute from the spreadsheet. Our treasurer can also go in and record payments. So that part is pretty nice.

What I haven't been able to really get working is a simple way to have people register with our wordpress site and be able to access their CiviCRM profile. I've got a civi/wordpress sync plugin going, and I can make custom forms. But I can't give a wordpress user a link to 'edit their own profile'. The best is telling them linking them to civicrm page in wp-admin, and telling them to search for themselves (and getting their wordpress role to match a civicrm role). Ultimately, I'm sure it's doable, but it's more complex. I really think I'd like it better if I can just setup a ""members.domain.com"" and not have to worry about a wordpress setup. Just create accounts or let people register with their email and be a standalone system."
