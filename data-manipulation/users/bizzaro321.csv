It says the exposure was caused by a ""misconfiguration"" of one of its internal customer support databases. The company claims it found no evidence of ""malicious use.""

>The server included conversation logs dating as far back as 2005 between Microsoft support personnel and customers from across the world. According to Comparitech, the database wasn't password-protected.

>Microsoft says the ""vast majority"" of personal data that was exposed was redacted. However, Comparitech notes some information, such as email and IP addresses, was stored in plain text. Had someone been able to access the logs, they could have used them to more easily impersonate the company's support staff in a phishing scheme.

TLDR: The info that was leaked was support chat message logs, which mainly included email addresses, IP addresses, and the specific issue each customer had. This could have been used by scammers to pose as Microsoft, which is already a major problem - but allegedly no one “maliciously” accessed such data."
