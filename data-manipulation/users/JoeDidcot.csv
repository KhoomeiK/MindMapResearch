excel,ff8uejv,t1_ff6d3zf,1579696430.0,"I think elsewhere on this thread we spoke about using filters to acheive the same result. The problem with filtering the table in excel would be that the filter would be visible, but not actually affect the data.

I think this would be a really good time to have a try at using Power Query, if you haven't already used it. With any cell in Table2 selected, click Data > Get Data > From table. 

You can then apply filters on the screen that appears, and click ""close and load to..."" > ""table"". This will create a new table which is a copy of Table2, but with your filters applied. Crucially, the new table will contain only the data shown by the filters in power-query. These filters affect not what is visible, but actually what is included. 

My own opinion is that too much effort invested in doing this by formula is unwise in that it's making the difficult-to-debug problem worse for next time, and it's depriving yourself of a good chance to move towards the power-query way of working, which many find to be faster and more fun."

excel,ff686a4,t3_eruqge,1579621412.0,"I've had a bit of a look at this. What I *think* is going on is that the previous excel fella is using Aggregate instead of COUNTA, and then loading into it an array of ""true/false"". It seems like a really convoluted way of making a sumproduct, which is what we used to do before COUNTIFS got invented.

I think this will become dramatically easier if we rip the guts out of it, and stuff a sumproduct in instead.

Edit:

I've worked out a bit more. This is a function to sort the results of the table into a new range, in ascending order, disregarding some values.

I think it works like this:

    =@IF(
    	ROWS($A$36:A38)<=$C$34,
        ...more formula....
    	    	"""")

    				(ROW(Table2[Booking Value Currency])-ROW(Table2[[#Headers]])),

Means, ""Ignore any entries in table 2 where [Currency] is not the same as C8.""

""With what's left, tell me all of the table IDs, in the same order in which they appear"".

Unless I'm missing *quite a lot*, this formula could be replaced by just using filters on Table2."
