What I'm trying to say I'd, they can't/don't enforce the rules they already have.

I've had unregistered bikes overtake me on the left, on a single lane road. Me in a car.

This was a main road too, not some quiet back road."

It's like the idiots riding non road legal dirtbikes on the road.  It's already illegal, but you can't see their faces, no number plate, highly mobile off road vehicle - how do you stop it?  I have a workmate, and he says they ride up and down his street all day, and no-one does anything to try and stop them.  What can you do?"

perth,ffjpqfi,t3_etzagn,1580003852.0,"""...is there something about Perth that we Victorians are ignorant about "" 

Just my personal opinion, but Perth always seems to have had a chip on it's shoulder about being more like Melbourne.

I've been here 15 years, and it was very sterile when I first moved here.  Seems to have got a lot better (they've been pushing to make it more vibrant), and there is certainly more of a buzz around the city than there used to be.  But Melbourne, it isn't.

I would strongly suggest coming here for a visit, see if it's for you.  Have a stroll around the City Centre/Northbridge, see what is has to offer.  Then check out the beaches, Fremantle, the hills and the Swan Valley, and a few nice spots along the river (Point Walter, South Perth, Blackwall Reach), see if the trade off in vibrancy is made up by the weather/other stuff to do.

We are very remote here though.  Check out the wiki page for towns/populations in WA, and you will get the idea:
