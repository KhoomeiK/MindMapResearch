*”That bad boy made 455 buff as f***ck horses in 1972. 1972!”*"
Rengarmains,ffdtpjz,t1_ffdru2u,1579828684.0,I’m not going to debate with someone who can’t articulate proper sentences
Rengarmains,ffbut6m,t1_ffbksrr,1579783495.0,I took a total of about 45 seconds to look at your recent comments and you remind me of the neck beard from the world of Warcraft episode from South Park.
Rengarmains,ffbthdu,t1_ffbksrr,1579782153.0,"If you’re saying when fighting two opponents with nothing but d blade that are both nearly full hp (one of them with electrocute) that it does not matter when you cast your W, then you can go canoe up three rivers"
Rengarmains,ff9jct1,t1_ff9ihad,1579714246.0,"I seem to be the minority when I say this but I think the champ is well balanced in his current state. His other abilities really aren’t anything to ride home on and his W kind of defines his damage and outplay potential. I think once people adjust to how it works they will not think it’s busted anymore. I like playing against a sett, i have not played him yet though"
Rengarmains,ff9hevh,t1_ff9fwxj,1579713073.0,I think a sett lane is much easier than garen
Rengarmains,ff8xzsi,t1_ff8qm7p,1579699707.0,I used fleet in this clip. Personally I like fleet better in all matchups because it just suits my play style better
Rengarmains,ff8vmef,t1_ff8oo1t,1579697603.0,Just looking to get the most value out of them
Rengarmains,ff85hdl,t1_ff8569d,1579666532.0,"Quick trades are your friend and trading when you have W available/his W his down. I use fleet in lane which helps with sustain and I buy a refillable first back to ensure I’m not going to be dying much, can stay in lane longer, and allows me to take ignite."
GetMotivated,fetrj7d,t1_fetrf6f,1579378972.0,I never said hard WORK. Just said HARD.
GetMotivated,fetqvbw,t1_fetfqgq,1579378549.0,Do you really believe that?

Choose your hard."
legaladvice,fep2zqb,t1_feobsmy,1579310982.0,I never resigned anything. They just sent me the letter saying I must pay the larger amount. No signing was done.
legaladvice,feo6e2c,t1_feo68dl,1579295769.0,"They are correct, I am not entitled to the money. However, they said that I was and the president and myself both signed a contract agreeing to it (Referencing the oct 10th contract)."
KhaZixMains,fedmtkm,t3_eojkp2,1579015361.0,"The “behind the scenes” of the quest is that kha zix fucked up rengars eye back when he was knee high to a squirrel. This fucked up rengars life pretty good, his dad and village and shit abandoned him and he had to fend for himself. Rengar wanted to prove to his dad that he’s actually cool af, and started collecting the bones of his kills (bone tooth necklace), and he doesn’t want to stop till he lays out the ole bug, and proves he is the cooliest hunter. That’s where it comes from. 

The quest begins once both rengar and kha have fully completed each of their passives. I.e. rengar has all 5 stacks on bone tooth necklace and kha has reached level 16 and has 3 evolutions."

single,fdx0hp6,t3_en9q4i,1578764089.0,"Honestly I think this sub is a gateway for people to socialize. I would have a very hard time believing many people actually meet up, and is more intended for people to mingle, chat, and not feel like they’re alone."
truerateme,fdqyzri,t3_emibjw,1578677087.0,"Just curious, what is the highest score one can get in this sub? I don’t understand why this is being rated a 6, and have never seen anyone rated higher than a 7. What would a perfect score entail?"
Corvette,fdqkxmg,t3_emkl14,1578669154.0,Nothing better than a vette with red interior.
police,fdhx9hv,t1_fdhwjsh,1578431820.0,"They won’t even do that. Bikes are far too fuel efficient and there is no telling how much fuel is in the bike, could go on for 100+ miles."
AskReddit,fdewcos,t3_ekx7gi,1578347966.0,"Many officers do not ask this question. This is an “old timer” thing. On every stop I made, before they even said a word, they were told my name, my departments name, and why they were stopped. I would usually ask if there was a reason for their offense, just to see how they would respond. 

It was also written in our policy that we were absolutely not to ask this question. From my perspective, it is much easier for an officer to extend their discretion to you and not give you a ticket if you are honest with them and seem genuine. Just my $.02."
leagueoflegends,fcuq48v,t1_fcu8ta0,1577986239.0,"As a rengar main, Mord is by far the easiest matchup for me."
AskReddit,fc4moes,t3_efyjrm,1577421240.0,"Not really crazy but the one that stuck with me. Context, my dad had a heart attack when I was 13 and I was so panic struck at the time I couldn’t do anything but watch. If it weren’t for my stepmom calling an ambulance, he likely would’ve died. 

I responded to a call in a building in a corporate business district for a man who collapsed at work and is unresponsive. Go inside, see a 50s-ish year old man on the ground who had turned a white-ish blue. About 25 people were sorrounding him while one person was *attempting* to do CPR. I stepped in immediately, no pulse, and began CPR. As I began, I broke his ribs (indicating guy who was doing CPR before me was likely doing it incorrectly). After a little over 10 minutes straight of me doing CPR, I finally obtained a pulse.  After 15 MINUTES of doing CPR, paramedics arrive (this was an excruciatingly long response time for my city). They begin hooking up their automatic CPR rig and begin medicating. They transported him to the nearest hospital where he passed due to a lack of oxygen to his brain. 

The entire time I was doing CPR, all I could do was see my dad. I was doing what I should have done for him to a complete stranger. I looked at his pale body and saw my dad laying their, dying. Every cop deals with different calls differently, both at the scene, and mentally after. This one personally wrenched me."
