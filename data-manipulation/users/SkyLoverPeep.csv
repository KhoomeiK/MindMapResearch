AskReddit,ffuq2pc,t1_fftmlse,1580247145.0,"Dam this hit me hard. A couple of years ago I met a long time friend from the internet, we used to constantly play an mmorpg together. We met in real life a few years after I had quit playing online games, for a few week going great. We lived about and hour and a half away from each other, at first we'd take turns driving out to see one another. I was so happy these few weeks, I grew up never having friends, this the first time I had someone other than my family to hang out with. It didn't take very long for him to start saying he couldn't drive to meet me. He he had an excuse for it everytime so I was the one who went outta my way every week to go see him. After a month of this shit and being constantly harrased to get back into spending hours of my life playing that old online game together I cut him outta my life. I threw away a month of my life going outta my way, to see someone who wouldn't give me the time of day unless it was convient for him. I was exhausted, and drained everyday from trying to make this dying relationship work. I bawled my eyes out for awhile, I felt like the dumbest person alive for being manipulated like that."

aww,feip0fc,t1_feinwzh,1579143668.0,"I agree, I don't know how anyone could just dump  a poor, innocent, kitty and have no qualms about doing so. Sweet baby boy is now spoiled to the max, he's never going back to the streets."
aww,fei1su8,t1_fei10vx,1579128415.0,"Aw thank you! He's the sweetest lil kitty boy, I'm blessed he choose me to take care of him. He's now living his retirement as a Grandpa to two baby poodles."
aww,fei1eio,t1_fei032n,1579128174.0,"I'm assuming by the other comment you kinda got the answer to this. He's the first male I've had, and the second cat I've ever had, ( other one is girl) I didn't really know much about cats before them. As for looking sick, I guess he's always kinda looked that way? He used to look worst than this, he had a uper respiratory infection that had some nasty side effects, but that is gone now since he's gotten treatment for it."
aww,fehzebz,t1_fehyc8t,1579126965.0,"We have actually, the vet did blood work on him and determined he has hyperthyroidism. He's on thyroid pills now and it's done wonders for him! He's gained some weight and mussle, which were all really, really happy about!"
aww,fehz5sa,t1_fehy02e,1579126823.0,"Cinnamon has hyperthyroidism, which has made him extremely skinny and couldn't gain any weight or mussle no matter how much he eats. He was a street cat for 10-14 years before he litterly walked into my room, took over my bed, and decided to never leave. He's on thyroid medication now for it, kinda hard to tell from the picture but before you could really feel every bone in his body. He's gaining weight and mussle now, so he's slowly but surely on the road to recovery!


Little side story: We thought he was a girl but he's actually a boy, we found out a month ago which is why he is named Cinnamon.

AskReddit,fdo0bwu,t3_em7trd,1578596493.0,"I played that Build a Bear Workshop game ( I think it was called Bearville? ) I made myself a male avatar on my first account. 

Big mistake.

I was constantly hit on by what I'm assuming was ""girls"" as their avatars were female, and often flirted back. I enjoyed the attention, having random girls fight over me and change into those ugly PG bikinis asking me if they looked cute in them, asking me on dates, ect.

Nothing crazy happened untill one day I got a private message from a random girl I was by. I will never forget what she wrote, : ""Hey handsome wanna come over to my place? Don't you wanna see what's under these clothes
?""

I started freaking out as she was constantly messaging me things like that, so I left that account and made a new one as a female avatar. Was never bothered again thankfully.

I almost feel bad for what I did, they had absolutely no idea they were flirting/ ""kissing""/ going on dates with a young pansexual girl."
AskReddit,fdlh3dg,t1_fdkgfia,1578523880.0,"I totally agree with this, I have the best time playing with kids. I used to work as a volunteer teaching young kids with mental disabilities how to sing, dance, ect. It was my first time ever working with kids, and it was the most amazing experience. I had so much fun playing and teaching them, it really surprised me how the other volunteers talk down to them and never fully engaged in any activity saying it's too embarrassing. I didn't give a dam about that crap, if I look ridiculous having fun with the kids then so be it. It was worth it to see how happy it made them."
