For example, three moments in *Cats* that elicited reactions from me: the grinning cat in the clouds at the start, the collective exhausted flop after The Jellical Ball, and the Macavity reveal. There are way more, but my point is that letting those reactions roll off my back doesn't do me any good when later trying to examine the movie critically."

The last people convicted of treason were from WWII. We've caught people spying for the USSR and even they, of all people, weren't  convicted of treason. 

A lot of people don't like to acklowledge that an American doing bad things against American interests is not automatically treason. People like the word because it feels like it is the only thing that can stick anymore. It's an easy emotional accusation. 

The crime is the only one defined in the Constitution an it has a really high bar to clear. A king could casually accuse someone of treason to get rid of them. The Founders didn't want that. So they made it the most difficult law to change beyond their initial vision. 

Anyone calling for treason charges on Trump are the ""doomed to repeat it"" camp. They are being just as ignorant as any MAGA hat dum-dum. Don't get upset that we can't use the biggest hammer in the room. Trump has done a lot of bad shit worthy of the use of lesser, but still big hammers.
