I mean, what do they even do if Diana and Qiyana go in and don't instantly get a kill (which they won't vs Xayah Leblanc)? GP just ults on top of the Aphelios and the Swain and the divers die.  

Honestly, how do you even play that comp? Felt kinda impossible if the game was even. I still think Bwipo and Nemesis kinda inted in game and they made some dumb decisions. But they got hard outdrafted. 

Don't even think their draft was bad, I just think Origen drafted really well and with a very different read of the meta. Xayah + Rakan instead of Senna/Aphelios. Gragas+Rakan priority over Rumble/Qiyana. Gangplank as a safe scaling top with global influence.  

They basically just drafted a top tier season 9 draft and apparently, those still work in this meta."
leagueoflegends,ffgvcmn,t1_ffgf1t3,1579916002.0,"They got out-comped hard too. Three Divers and Braum+Aphelios? It could work but a GP ult just divides them up. 

Then Bwipo and Nemesis just couldn't follow up on perfect set up from Selfmade. Like Bwipo flashes and misses E completely. Nemesis second time whiffs Q after Selfmade flash stuns.  

What the fuck are they doing. Felt bad for Rekkles, honestly."
leagueoflegends,ffguupk,t1_ffgu916,1579915643.0,"Yes, but if you nerf Senna's damage she becomes way better as a support. And if you nerf Aphelio's Crescendum interactions, the champion becomes way less powerful.  

The champions won't be useless, but they won't be Kai'sa/Xayah levels of broken. Utility can come from other positions. What you need in an AD is damage output. So either an AD needs to pump out enormous damage, or have the ability to remain safe to increase up time.  Nerf the damage and Senna and Aphelios have neither. And I'd rather have Ashe Arrow or Varus Chain over a conditional Gravitum."

leagueoflegends,ffgry8a,t1_fffveap,1579913528.0,"Honestly, I feel like Aphelios and Senna are just overtuned. Turn down the damage and we're back to Xayah+Kai'sa. Xayah and Kai'Sa aren't good because of their numbers, the base kit is really good.  

I mean, their ults just bring way more value. Senna and Aphelios are just stat check champions."
leagueoflegends,ffgrs72,t1_fffndib,1579913406.0,"It's honestly ridiculous that if I try to pick Senna AD in my gold games, people start harassing me that 'Senna is a support that deals no damage'... When I'm 20-8."
teenagers,fffhyiv,t1_fffgrao,1579884359.0,"Yes, but in Portugal there's a literal element of luck. No one is expected to score >90%, and if more than say 10% of the class did (2 students in a class of twenty), the teacher would assume the test was way too easy and make a harder one after. More than 2-3 students having more than 90% is completely unheard of.

To get into a medical degree (the one that requires a higher grade) you only need an average of about 86%. Depending on the competition you might need 90 in some years, but that's not really usual. That being said, if you don't want to be a doctor... it's useless. I had like a 85% average and I won a prize for being the student with the highest average in my electrical engineering program.

Also, from what I've seen from watching American University 101 classes on calculus and physics. That's very close to our high school math and physics. (In fact, my college physics I class was 100% a repeat of my high school physics class) Real Analysis  (what passed for calculus in our program) was twelfth grade math with less probability and statistics and more multivariate calculus and integrals."

coolguides,fff3sv1,t1_ffe4f03,1579874947.0,"I'm like the same but opposite of you. I'm a texture eater, which means I like my steak rare or blue rare. I like the meat in the middle to be really smooth. Even pink meat starts becoming rougher.

It's like the difference between chicken legs and chicken chest. Chicken legs are smooth and delicious. Chicken chest tastes like I'm eating sand-paper. I can only eat it if I'm eating copious amounts of water. I really dislike the rougher, dry texture in meat.

On the other end, steak meat is priced for its taste as rare/medium rare. So if you enjoy your steak we'll done, you're probably getting similar quality with cheap steak meat. It's also not that different from well done pork. I think this is why ""steak snobs"" get mad at people that prefer well done steaks, they feel like you're destroying what makes that meat valuable. Like drinking expensive whiskey with coke."

teenagers,ffewuxe,t1_ffdmomx,1579868789.0,"Yoh, English is reasonably important. You'll need to write stuff, no matter your chosen profession, and people will judge you harshly if it's not good.

That being said, this paragraph is fairly well written so I'm baffled you're failing English. I mean it's colloquially written, but it's good. And you understood the thread you're reading, so your reading comprehension is fine.

So I'm kinda baffled you're failing English. I feel like you've demonstrated enough proficiency in the language to be able to pass an English exam.

teenagers,ffew3l5,t1_ffdxf0o,1579867984.0,"I'm always so confused when I hear Americans complain about not getting 90%. I'm Portuguese and getting 90% was something only the literal top student could ever get, and even that much was more about attention to detail and sometimes random luck than just knowledge.

Like, in a math exam if you messed up your algebra you'd get docked points. A single question you don't know and you're 100% not getting 90%, and there would definitely be a question you didn't know. Like, math tests always had a demonstrate that the volume of this weird form is given by this expression. Or show that the probability of this situation is given by y... And there was no training for those, you just had to be good at math. Portuguese tests you always had a writing portion for 30% of the grade and it was honestly hard to get all the points when you get docked for orthographic errors. Even bio had long form answers asking us how a text provides evidence for darwinism over creationism or asking us to explain the conversion of glucose into atp in human cells and use that to justify the advantages of aerobic breathing vs anaerobic processes. It was *really hard* to get full marks on those questions. Like roll of the dice hard, you did your best and figured out if it was enough when you got the test back. 

 I was one of the top students in my high-school and still could get more than 90% maybe half the tests? It would be incredibly unreasonable to punish your kid for not getting 90% here. Most kids never even got an 80% on any exam."
soccer,ffcbgqa,t1_ffc7l10,1579795838.0,"After the scandals 2 years ago, Sporting lost their star goal keeper and 3 players that were on the top level Portuguese national team. All-star quality players. The only quality players they kept was Bruno Fernandes and a slumping Bas Dost.   

That team was incredibly shit on paper... yet somehow we managed to come third, Bruno Fernandes, pretty much a base to base midfielder, was the third top striker in the entire league. His team came third and he got best player in the league, and I saw no one in Portugal complaining. Sporting was literally Bruno Fernandes and 10 other dudes at points.  

Personally, I think he needs some coaching with his emotions, he gets really mad for silly reasons and gets unnecessarily carded. He also tilts like no other. However, there's no denying on his quality as a player. He's a *beast.* With a level headed coach in an environment where he doesn't have to literally play alone and gets to play in his attacking mid-field comfort position like he did in his first season and gets to be creative with his passing? He'll be godly.

Do I think he's worth 65 mil? I'd be *mad* if Sporting sold him for less. We can't get reinforcements that match the hole he'll leave on the team. Even for 65 mil that will totally sacrifice our season (which is already shit anyway) and I'd rather we didn't sell."

Yeah, it's just a bunch of in-jokes that aren't all that funny out of context. But in the end you just find some accounts that are funny as fuck and eventually you even get the dumb trends and find them funny.

Why are we all complaining? Because giving our info to China is more harmful than giving it to the western mega corps? That seems flawed.

bernieblindness,ff2yi4h,t1_ff2xzmf,1579528669.0,"I know this isn't how news have worked in a long while... but I really feel like news should work like this:

You report the facts. 
You're done.

There should be some bias inherent to the selection of the facts you choose, but you shouldn't give *opinions*. If anything you can interview experts and share their opinions, but even then you have a duty of reporting an accurate picture of expert opinion, not pick and choose the experts you agree with.  So the New York Times interviewing an economist saying 'Bernie will be bad for the economy'? That's the sort of bias you can't really control. But the New York Times saying 'Bernie is bad, Warren is good.' That's not *journalism*.

I wish we could start some sort of non-profit foundation like Wikipedia that's based on reporting news impartially. Just reporting what happened. Sometimes I'd like to hear 'There's a fire in x and y, the firefighters say x, the police say y, the prime-minister said yxz' That's like 2 paragraphs of news. Maybe three.  And I'm *informed*.  I hate that all the newspapers try to do the thinking for me, instead of just reporting the facts."
TumblrInAction,ff2ssym,t1_ff2e98d,1579522635.0,"Not always. Some people are just legitimately confused about their gender identity. Say, they like skirts and looking pretty, but they also enjoy parts of male identity. Such 'non-binary' people simply prefer to not be identified as any gender as they don't want people's views of them, and (perhaps as importantly) their view of themselves, to be defined by societies' gender constructs.   

To be honest, I find the entire thing just another example where the new-age identitarian left perpetuates the things they're trying to fight. It seems obvious to me that if there's any problem, is that of strict gender roles and labels: Say, I probably wouldn't mind dressing up all pretty and cute once in a while with make up and all. But since that goes against what society thinks of as 'male', I'd instantly be thought of as queer, perhaps even homosexual, if I voiced that thought to *anyone* I personally know. I don't want to look cute enough to upend my life, so I shape my personality to fit what society considers 'normal'. This, to me, feels like the actual issue. The fact that society molds us to be a very specific person with very specific interests. It restricts personal freedom at a very fundamental level that I don't think is beneficial to society.

However, by focusing so much in all the labels, the LGBTQ+ (The name seems like satire of the point I'm about to make) instead of eroding the molding pressure of labels, simply creates new labels that define and mold someone. I might not fit entirely in the label 'Man' that society puts on you, but I definitely feel like it approximates my feelings more than the label 'transgender' or 'non-binary'. It's silly. We should be vying for normality in these things. And the quickest way to make things normal is to *not* label them and create activist groups that generate division between members of different labels.

It feels incredibly flawed that to assert your independence in choosing your own interests and desires independently from your biology you must identify yourself as another identity that similarly constrains you in the eyes of society."
