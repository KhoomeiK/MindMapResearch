mazda,ffilkrp,t3_ettcgp,1579976786.0,"1. I would recommend OEM mazda brakes if you dont drive it like a race car for one simple fact. Once you have them replaced at a dealership, they have a lifetime warranty.
2. Rear pads and machining rotors will usually run you $200-300 depending on if your dealer sells parts at MSRP or mark up, and what their labor rate is
3. No, Front and rear brakes can be replaced independantly of each other.
4. I think you may be misuderstanding the terminology. The ""brakes"" are part of a system comprising of a very ehaustive list of parts. When someone replaces their brakes they are usually replacing Brake Pads (Disk brake system) or Shoes (Drum Brake system) and either machining or replacing Brake Discs or Brake Drums.

A few caveats on the lifetime warranty. It applies to the brake pads or shoes only. It does not cover rotors or drums and does not cover labor."

With warranty repairs, Vw will require the Guided Fault Findings and possibly even an ODIS printout. That will read all the parameters at the time of failure (boost, speed, oil temperature, etc). If any of those parameters are out of spec (For example, if the mothership sees your turbo was pushing 40 psi when it failed but dont see any turbo related codes), they will know its tuned and will flag your car as TD1.

It will also check the ECU ""Flash Counter"". That is a counter that keeps track of how many times the ECU has been flashed. For example, Right now, your counter is probably at 3. One was when the ECU was first loaded with the program for the vehicle. Two was probably when the first stage of the emissions fix was done. Three was probably when the final fix was applied. So Vw has their internal check at 3 flashes for your car. If you flash it with Malone, it would go to 4. If you flash it back to stock when you take it in for a warranty claim, that would be 5. So when Vw checks your car and sees 5 when they show 3, They would flag you TD1.

Once you are TD1, any warranty claim can (and most likely will) be denied."
