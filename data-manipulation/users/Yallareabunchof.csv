Like the internet exists and while it can be hard to cross reference the data it's there. For instance your girl this guy she wants would have to be at least a 1% in income (in the US) to afford that stuff. So seeing as some of the 1% are women you're literally down to less than 1% of the population of the US just from money. Now you add in other stuff like height, looks, age, fitness, dick size. Like how many men fit the bill? 

The best part is your girl was 18 so her choices (back then) were like Justin Bieber and 3 other guys on the entire planet. Like how out to lunch can you be?

TL;DR Ladies it's okay to have standards, in fact you should. But do yourself a favour and run the numbers and see how realistic your standards are."

California must be a special place then."
canada,fd7g7ut,t1_fd4tbn3,1578203998.0,LOL elites. Dude the conservative assholes that own the businesses want cheap labour. THAT is what is going on as it always has been. Give your head a fucking shake.
canada,fd7bh14,t1_fd4axi8,1578201956.0,Sadly it will always be this way.
canada,fd7bbv0,t1_fd2v2eb,1578201900.0,You're right but I'm not sure public transit can really work for a country as big as Canada. We need MUCH smaller personal vehicles. to match our climate.

Something something vegetarians caused world war 2. ;)"

Except for food and coffee especially coffee. Even my company gives out all the free go juice you want."
todayilearned,fd77wnw,t1_fd60f8j,1578200593.0,LOL you're such an idiot.
todayilearned,fd54fwb,t1_fd3pgsr,1578174127.0,"Yeah everyone should share the load. Today things are better guys do  the cooking, the cleaning, the laundry and most of the other traditionally ""pink"" jobs plus all the blue jobs and work more hours to boot. 

God I can't wait to get married ;)"
AskReddit,fd52rko,t1_fd3oy6y,1578173708.0,"Unless you at a *minimum* top 5% wage earner in virtually every country you should be economising and watching the expenditure of every dollar ruthlessly.

If that person isn't they don't realize how ""poor"" they really are.

TL;DR Generally people are REALLY bad with money."
insanepeoplefacebook,fcxu9g0,t1_fcwxvcx,1578070587.0,This is awesome. I always have a good laugh when some moron ends up off themselves especially when it's for *bullshit social media.*
PublicFreakout,fcxtfwc,t1_fcx5by1,1578070181.0,"You mean it was only at that point you realized that men put up with terrible shitty women just because they are attractive?

That's pretty important to know since that one factor shapes a lot of our society."
trashy,fc9grf6,t3_egk4m4,1577552445.0,Could have killed him. This old man should be locked up for attempted murder. If I recall correctly most falling deaths are from 7 feet or less.

canada,fc6g6w3,t1_fc6ada6,1577479814.0,"Yeah this is a good point. Arguing otherwise is business ""logic"" which is as always bullshit.

If you want to state salaries you state them by the hour or by a 2080 hour a year work week if that's what you're offering full stop. You can say ""there is overtime available/mandatory"" but don't pretend it part of the base.

Saying I am paid 400 dollars an hour makes it sounds like I am a rich man until I tell you they only have 2 hours a week of work for me."
canada,fc6fuf0,t3_egeksr,1577479581.0,"As people have already said here every time there isn't enough people will to do X job the wages aren't good enough.

Try paying 50 dollars and hour you'll have thousands of resumes so fast you won't know what to do. Oh offer to train people without skills at that pay and you'll triple that amount. 

Fuck you business world start getting real and you'll start getting employees."

Got it."
todayilearned,fc6dlga,t1_fc5szer,1577478065.0,But how will anyone know you're a big manly man if you don't drive some kind of massive jeep? /s
canada,fbjn9sj,t1_fbis568,1576936721.0,If that's the case why would the prosecution proceed with trial trying to convict a clearly innocent man?
