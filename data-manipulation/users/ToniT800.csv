embedded,ffw9ldr,t1_ffw8vsx,1580291111.0,Because I speak from my own experience and because I had to work with such half assed projects/partners. It is a huge PIA.
embedded,ffutb4g,t3_evb5nu,1580248941.0,"Arduino gives people false belief that they understand electronics and hardware programing. After flashing few LEDs and using premade I2C library with some fucking sensor shield these people start to work on complex projects, in which every fucking problem is ""solved"" by an Arduino or even several arduinos.


 Consequently, these projects don't work as intended, and because the person has zero fucking understanding of what they are doing and fully relying on premade hardware/software they don't know what to do and the whole project ends up as a half assed mess.

Believe me, every engineer or scientist I have yet worked with, who was using Arduino as their primery tool, was a useless stupid cunt.



Arduino is a toy for amateurs. Do you want to be amateur or an engineer? Choose your tools properly."

When I was very young I have drunk so many coctail which made me regret my life choices for the rest of the night and the following day. Nevertheless, I was totally fine later. No brain damage, no nerve damage, no addiction etc. 


Now tell me what would happen to me if I take a tripple dose of heroin and chase it with lsd later. Will I be fine 24h later?"
