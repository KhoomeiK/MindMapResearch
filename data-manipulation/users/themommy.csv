aww,fectcq7,t1_fech322,1578983835.0,"I like that I got a NSFW warning about this sub. All the adorable dogs, houseplant and car pics are entirely unacceptable for workplace viewing. Thank you, Reddit."

OldSchoolCool,fdjgj13,t1_fdj81d3,1578469819.0,"The older one IS on the left. For women as they age, everything spreads and gets fluffier long before it all starts dragging the ground.

mildlyinteresting,fcpj57p,t1_fcphnfz,1577865560.0,"Meh, he was on after the ball dropped and all the kissing concluded."
mildlyinteresting,fcphvbb,t3_eiehli,1577864742.0,What is satisfying to me is that you have Herdez on your shelf.
UlcerativeColitis,fbx9l50,t3_eefonu,1577175700.0,"Nope, not yet. Finally diagnosed almost 6 months ago. Also the reason I've barely left the house for 2 years. Sooo much dread for what will inevitably happen."
