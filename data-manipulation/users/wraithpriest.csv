Undergrounds,ff36m6q,t1_ff2wv6b,1579534926.0,"I'm actually really grateful and kind of flattered by your comment, the lighting was actually all set up by me - it's simply a pair of Big Larry's, a couple of handheld led lensers and then a good exposure on a Canon 4000D controlled from my phone. 

 It's not a tourist mine, though we don't need gas meters as it's a stone mine so doesn't carry the associated risks of places such as iron or coal mines (for others: bad gas, low oxygen levels). We do have bump caps (you can see mine on backwards) but removed them as the reflective strips on the edges made it hard to account for during the shot. 

The main risks in this are actually just slips and falls, or simply getting lost if unprepared, as its a single level that extends a long way horizontally instead of vertically (ie no false floors etc)."

Undergrounds,femc2kt,t1_felnddf,1579247997.0,"Fox kill I reckon, I think most of it is likely a rabbit or similar,  there probably was a surface access nearby it. Now it seems to have no surface access at all, not even for small animals."
Undergrounds,fel6fnu,t1_fel542i,1579215062.0,"It is, surveys are purchasable online but I would recommend tracking down a knowledgeable guide as the entrances are difficult to find internally and there are around 20km of passages."
