There are often volunteers who come in around the clock to feed hatchlings who've been blown from their nests. It's incredible the lengths people go to for these birds.

They have large enclosures where fledglings can go out with older birds who are recovering from broken wings and other injuries to learn proper bird behaviours, including what to do about predators -- they're protected by the enclosure, but they don't know that. Birds who've grown up in rehabs are usually released, and they don't look back.

Write back to the flying monkeys one time only, telling them you're disappointed in them for taking back their support. You may even want to quote their own words to them to shame them. Tell them they have one last chance to stay in your life, and if they mention *her* again, you're going to banish them, block them and they won't be able to reach you again. Is it worth it to them to lose you, just to be her evil little minions? If not, then they know how to behave. If they *can't* behave, block them without another word.

If you're feeling generous, and miss them, reach out in six months or so to see if they've had a change of heart -- you can always block them again. I'd bet that you can reclaim at least some of your family, if that's important to you, once she's driven them away and they realize what a saint you are for having endured your previous life for 28 years! Regardless, you have decades ahead of you to create the family you deserve, who will love you and cherish you as you should have been done all this time. I'd never wish pain on anyone, but the sun must be much brighter to someone who's never seen it than to a person who's always known it.

Please forgive a foolish old woman's ramblings on a sleepless night. I hope that you're going to hold your head high and be proud of yourself for your accomplishments, knowing that nobody's ever allowed to drag you down again. You're the one in charge now, and forever. We're all here for you, and we're ***all*** proud of you. Love, Granny. ♡"

EntitledPeople,fefqlfk,t3_eolusa,1579062387.0,"PayPal can handle fraud issues for up to 30 days after a charge. Credit card companies can do it for 90 days. You're well past 90 days, but you should still try your CC company to see if there's anything they can do. 

Credit cards are the final word if that's what you have linked to PayPal, BTW, though you should try to go through PayPal first."

AmItheAsshole,fee6su4,t1_fed82ky,1579027582.0,"I agree with this completely. Please, u/Throwawaysleo3i, tell your sister that she's the one who's wrong here. I'm an old granny and I'm very disappointed in her. She should have taken a stand for you, her little brother, whom she should have always protected. That's a role that older siblings are *supposed* to play. 

Maybe I'm old fashioned, maybe parents don't tell their children to watch over each other anymore; but if one of my friends had a sibling who was bullying mine, you best believe I'd have had a serious talk with that friend and the sibling would've been reined in! If my friend didn't do it, we wouldn't have been friends anymore, and I'd have taken care of the bully myself. 

You're NTA, but your sister very much ***IS***. I recommend you have her read these and open her myopic eyes. Love, Granny. ♡"

Seriously, they can -- and do -- take people away as needed. They even bar them from the hospital and from calling through the switchboard. They're brilliant at doing what patients can't."
