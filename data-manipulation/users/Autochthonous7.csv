Parenting,fg7zu57,t3_exc22d,1580605755.0,A seven year old has no clue what’s best for him. Your ex wife asking for that is beyond ridiculous and honestly pretty selfish. He needs his father. Even if he has a step father. You just explain to him that’s not an option and that he’s coming to your house. He has brothers and he will be treated equally to them because he is an equal. These life lessons are important. Imagine if you go through with that and at 17 he’s pissed because you “abandoned” him for your other kids. How would you even explain something like that? Imo what he is requesting is not even an option.

Parenting,fg5uez1,t3_ewyf8w,1580539304.0,Best course of action is to not respond. Tell your DIL that her mom contacted you and leave it at that. You should not be involving her nonsense.

AmItheAsshole,fg1845l,t3_ew2zcr,1580422548.0,"YTA- who refers to a deceased person as an ex? He’s a widower. So you’re getting married to a widower just two years after the passing of his wife, and are expecting his daughter to be okay with that? Just to be clear this wedding would never be happening if he was not widowed. Also, just so you are aware you will never be more important to him than his daughter."

askwomenadvice,ffk63te,t3_eu1q1j,1580017098.0,"I call this “work politics”. They are essentially in every business/job/what have you. You have to navigate the field and see what’s gonna be to your advantage. Sometimes you have to ask for feedback, allow for input, pretend like you give a rats booty about what so and so thinks, and other times you just stick to your guns. (But you always have to be confident in what you do. Show that you know your stuff. )The only issue is figuring out when to do what. You will find your way. Good luck and don’t let these fools bring you down!"
relationships,ffjxhew,t3_etx84d,1580009646.0,"Your ex is a total butthead. He’s mad because you stood up for yourself, made your own choices, and don’t need him anymore.

TrueOffMyChest,fewhura,t3_eqnzbu,1579410851.0,"I’m sorry you feel this way. CPS should have been called on several occasions. But I don’t agree that a teacher should have caught your autism. They are not doctors. They should have referred you to their assessment/psych team. But a doctor would have to be involved in any case. This sounds like your parent dropped the ball and you think it should have been picked up in the classroom. What people need to stop doing is relying on the educational system to solve all their issues. Teachers are people just doing their jobs... of teaching. They are not your parents, protectors, doctors, emotional support systems etc."

But to answer your question... no I have not found anything that is similar but better."
relationships,fepndb1,t3_eq81ow,1579325144.0,So let me get this straight... Your friend dies and he goes out with his friends instead of comforting you to teach you a lesson? He has no regard for your feelings or needs. The most inappropriate time to try and teach a “lesson” is when a person is grieving. What’s he gonna try to teach you a lesson about next? He sounds very pretentious and like a gigantic butthead.

unpopularopinion,femb44d,t1_femas0z,1579246773.0,Someone is very pretentious. I’m just gonna assume it’s because you’re young and have no clue what it really entails. But like I said good luck.

unpopularopinion,fema4dd,t1_fem7lq3,1579245521.0,So you think it’s completely normal to question the paternity of your baby when you are in a marriage or stable relationship... That makes sense to you?  You don’t see any red flags there? It’s not normal at all.
