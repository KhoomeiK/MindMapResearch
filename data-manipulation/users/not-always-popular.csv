canada,ffgar1c,t3_etas2a,1579902128.0,How can we be fucking this up so bad? I haven’t paid 10 a gram since the early 90s. My guy delivers it to my door cheaper than I can buy it from a dispensary. Having to over build the dispensary and having it staffed by 6 people at all times has got to have something to do with it and the insane amount of packaging

hockey,ff1s1z5,t1_ff1r6b5,1579484913.0,If Zack does that too MT I’m certain you’d be on here saying Zack has no place in the NHL. I have zero problems with old timer hockey but MT can’t play the douchebag and not answer the bell. The NHL fucked up and now something ugly is going to happen and imho it’ll be on Parros head. Call a penalty on MT for that first hit to the head/charge and none of this even happens
hockey,ff1rg38,t1_ff1luyy,1579484540.0,I think you’re forgetting the /s because I have zero faith in the NHLs DoPS
