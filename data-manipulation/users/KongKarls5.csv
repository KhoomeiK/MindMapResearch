worldpolitics,ff3t4fe,t1_ff3risp,1579548279.0,"Lol I believe in being generous of my own free merit, people who think that being more open to being taxed somehow makes you a better person is ludicrous. It sounds like you made the most of your life and did your own thing, that's great. I believe that people have individual rights that should enable them to make their own decisions and take responsibility for bad ones and to learn. I believe in going out of your way to help people in your community, not because you are required to but because it is right. I do not trust the way the US government or any other government wants to spend the money I earn. I think taxes have a value to an extent, but I do not support universal healthcare, or free tuition. I know way too many people who advocate for those things because they feel like they are victims when the reality is they really don't try very hard and were raised poorly. 

Billionaires are greedy, yeah, but I don't envy them, I just try to build the best life I can for myself and I am happy. I believe I have an opportunity to do that in the US, where if you make $30k a year you are in the top 1% of the world."
