KitchenConfidential,ffgkcjm,t3_etfen3,1579908223.0,"Was in the industry for 14 years, spent 8 as the executive sous at a high end Applebees/gastro pub. 400 people on fridays and saturdays was the standard most of the year and because the owner was a money grubbing POS he would happily seat 25 er 40 walk ins at 6 on top of it. Servers would work 4 hours make 450 tax free and the kitchen staff wouldn't get so much as a shift drink er family meal.  When we started catering outside of normal hours I finally got an arrangement that of the 18% gratuity charge that 50% would go to the kitchen. After 5 parties and not a sent I finally got fed up with it and walked. 

Went to a lil shithole country bar and the first night I was there the servers tipped out 25% to the kitchen and everyone stopped working at 9 and sat down to a meal and a beer. A week later the owner asked if I needed some money for glasses cause he thought I was having trouble reading tickets and told me to just have the Dr send em the bill. I broke down n cried I couldnt believe it. The disproportionate pay rate for the service industry and especially back of house is grotesque!"
