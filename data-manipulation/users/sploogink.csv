tales,ffxqkfw,t1_ffvy4iy,1580330453.0,Found a 160 GB ps3 slim at a game store for 100 bucks with a 2month return policy so I am good. Way cheaper than  random ones on Amazon. And they are literally across the road from my work so if it doesn't work I'll just go tell them. They said they just cleaned and tested it a week ago so hopefully its good.

todayilearned,ffui6op,t1_ffs5xyv,1580242474.0,When people have these types of beliefs any sort of evidence even if its vague just goes right over their head. One bad cop does not spoil the bunch you are speaking like humans are just apples.

todayilearned,ffs5qj8,t1_ffrgl6u,1580173806.0,"Has movies, literature, history, everything not fucking taught us just because one group has a couple bad apples that we should not assume all of them are bad. Because I remember that always being a life lesson in a huge majority of shit I have seen.

I am not all for "" the world is a great place you dont know what you are talking about."" Half the time I hate this world. It's full of hate violence and racism and it makes me sick to my stomach. But your sort of thinking is not progressive and I hope you can see that. It helps no one.

You are literally being the definition of ignorance. I dont mean that as an insult I am just stating the way I see things man. Let's work on actually bettering this world. The way we keep thinking these days is not going to allow us to move forward as mankind. We are blocking our own evolution."
todayilearned,ffs3m34,t1_ffrgl6u,1580172298.0,"I'm sorry to say but that doesn't happen like you think it does lol. Your quite entitled to your opinion and I may be far from police officer material but a huge chunk of my family was on the force so I see a lot more than you do my friend. Both my dads brothers are county sheriff's. So they are the top brass of the county police. And I see them a lot. And hear a lot. And see a lot. More than you ever could. And it's not what you think.

This stigma of anti police started with people breaking the law and getting fined or arrested and instead of admitting their own fault they blame it on someone else(because that's what most people do) and that person was a police officer. And then you get some stories about some officers doing horrible shit, because like I said earlier they are just humans and some are bad and some are good, and you combine both those together and you get this huge anti police movement.

Now do I believe the justice system is broken and fucked? oh hell yes it is. Do I believe some counties might have some pretty corrupt cops? You are damn right? Do I believe some bad eggs makes all of them bad eggs? No I fucking dont and that is an absolute ignorant way of thinking and why we are no longer progressing in peace and everyone getting along but regressing.

My uncles know some cops are corrupt and some academies are doing a shit job training these days and he is trying his damndest to fix it so not every fucking cop is seen as this horrible terrible entity when most are putting their fucking life on the line everyday to protect you. But you are not going to hear stories about the cops doing good because that's not news worthy. You are going to hear the bad stories which makes it seem like the bad stories completely outweigh the good because that's all that's 4reported. 

I look like a fucking punk, I talk like a punk, and I've done my fair shit of stupid shit in my life. But I have encountered primarily on helpful and respectful officers. I have schizoaffective disorder and have had huge psychotic breaks where the neighbors think its domestic violence and call the cops to find me just alone, scared, and out of my mind(looking like a pothead or a punk)and instead of arresting me or getting scared and shooting me when I tell them I am having a psychotic break they help me. Talk to me the whole time, drive me to the hospital, stay with me the whole fucking time until I am put in inpatient.

Last time it happened they of course had to handcuff me because I said I was suicidal so they have to handcuff me as part of their training but I was so nuts that when they handcuffed me I tried to resist because I thought all sorts of weird shit about who these cops were and yes the young one with no experience freaked out for a second until the older officer told him to calm the fuck down and sat with me the whole time at the hospital telling me it breaks his heart to see young adults deal with something so terrible like schizophrenia. And he stayed with me the whole time trying to help me be calm and be there for me. He even checked in on me at inpatient a few days later.

I have had situations like this several times.

When I was 18 downtown in my city high as fucking shit on molly to the point my eyes were rolling in the back of my head a police woman instead of arresting me or following me around helped me find my friends and had them take me home and watch me to make sure I was alright and take me to a hospital if anything bad happens. I remember her walking me to my friends telling me that she is not going to think about arresting me or anything of the sort and that I am a nice young man and it's sad to see me like this. And she knows a lot of young adults go through partying drug phases but she hopes I can snap out of it soon and continue on my path in life.

I have met a few asshole officers mainly state patrol but most of my experiences have been incredibly respectful and kind.

I lived with people when I was younger that some of them did hate cops and call them pigs and say how corrupt they were. These were people that were arrested for intoxicated driving, numerous graffiti tagging, etc. Shit that hurts other people and their property.

So I'm just saying dude I have fucking experience in my family and out. Stop spreading so much negativity you arent helping anything."
todayilearned,ffrfou0,t1_ffqvbnh,1580157165.0,"Sorry to say that's not every police officer I hope you do realize that. Some people join the force to legitimately protect people and their loved ones. There is good and bad people in this world and both those good and bad people can become good and bad police officers. Some trying to help while others are power hungry and want money.

It's not the police force that's corrupt its humans please get it in your head.

Both my uncles are county sheriff's and have had to arrest quite a few corrupt officers trying to remove this stigma against the police force. My uncles are the cops that arrest someone but then constantly work with those arrested for their issues to get them back on track and have a good life.
You would be surprised how many previous inmates are close to my uncles. And they share those values with a lot of their officers.

So stop thinking every cop is some corrupt power hungry asshole they are just people like you and me and some are fucking assholes just like every other damn human."

Futurology,ffhg2lc,t3_eteahl,1579933729.0,"I drive a delivery truck all day monday through friday and I have to say a couple things why traffic jams happen from what I see everyday.

People need to stop constantly changing lanes trying to move 2 seconds ahead of traffic. All this does is make the traffic jam worse.

Stop riding each other bumper to bumper. This makes everyone have to stop and accelerate more and creates a ripple effect making everyone eventually stop. 

Cutting people off forces all traffic to slam on their breaks.

Most of the time it's always a ripple affect from people not letting people in, people aggressively cutting through traffic, and people driving bumper to bumper.

Traffic jams happen because people are so inpatient they cant manage to lose the two seconds they would lose by driving normally...except if everyone drove normally there wouldn't be a bunch if traffic you have to try to force your way ahead of.

Also one other thing I have noticed for traffic jams is if you are on a highway or freeway and see someone in the other traffic direction pulled over or any type of fender bender or crash. Do not slow down to stare at it. I think most people don't even realize they do it. But, they do. And it causes huge traffic jams and doesn't help the people that got in the accident and it honestly sucks to just have people stare at you as they drive by.

But I do agree if every car was on the same automated system traffic jams would not happen. I dont know why it apparently takes mathematicians to figure this out it's kind of a no brainer if every car was on the same automated system traffic would move near flawless."

So them instantly being skeptical and assuming it's a rapist is fucking retarded. Its that stupid culture that thinks they are so ""woke"" but instantly assumed some guy just trying to relate with kids and and people is a fucking rapist. This is what's wrong with our culture we let a few fucked individuals ruin the majority of the populations outlook on everything.

I can give you about a 99.9 percent assurance the dude is just trying to relate with the younger crowd and just trying to play some fucking pokemon go.

I am not christian or catholic I am just saying everyone claims to be so woke these days yet they instantly assume someone is a rapist due to their religion, racist, homophobic, etc. Like it's the god damn witch hunts all over again.

Why can't people just go to work and suck it up. Sorry I'm being an asshole but man I got so pissed cause all the fuckers at my work calling in sick hungover. When I was 18 I went to work 6 hours after I fried on mushrooms(I got out of that stupid stage). I go to work when I have the flu if I can stay away from people. If you are hungover you did it to yourself suck it up because it starts to make employers paranoid when people call in sick.

If you have the type of job where someone else has to pick up the slack because you called in sick and you are calling in sick lying because you are hungover fuck you."

tales,fd5agk9,t1_fd4mnrb,1578175711.0,Itll probably be better than most f2p mobile rpgs. Most are the most trash formulaic things I have ever played. And I bought a Galaxy 10 just so I could try out mobile games. So I have definitely been waiting for this since Tales of is my favorite JRPG series and I can get some use out of my 900 dollar phone lol.
tales,fd4jral,t1_fd3fq82,1578168159.0,As long as I have enough time to beat the main story I'll be good. I'll spend a little money to support the developers though.
tales,fd4bg2y,t1_fd3cvy5,1578166083.0,I look it up every day desperate for another Tales game even if its mobile and yeah it's going to have an english release. They just delayed it but are going to. It will be fully VA on the main story but it won't be in English.
