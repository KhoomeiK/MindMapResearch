Pointing out that the high costs of college is a detriment is a valid point, and it doesn't mean they hated college.  It means they're advising others to think more about whether they really want to go or not because depending on one's goals, it might not be worth the cost.

But I guess part of the problem is that a lot of teens feel like their problems aren't important enough to ask for help.  Plus one of the downsides of individualism is that people feel like they have to be capable of solving their own problems and never asking for help.  So they think if they need to ask for help, there must be something wrong with them.  They also live in a culture where expressing negative feelings is frowned upon, which often gives the idea that it's feeling those feelings that is bad, not so much how they manage them.

It's not just teen delusion, though.  A lot of adults in their lives contribute to that problem (deliberately or not) thinking it'll make their kids stronger if they're told just to suck it up and deal with it on their own.  I've mentioned before an example of problems with schoolwork.  We should encourage kids to ask for help, get some tutoring or advice instead of just yelling at them for not studying enough. On a proportionate level, encouraging them to seek help will get their problems solved and will likely head off a lot of issues before they balloon into huge problems that leave non-depressed teens desperate to the point of suicide."
unpopularopinion,fewcz8b,t1_few98nv,1579408574.0,"Depression can present differently.  Sometimes people have unbearable sadness, anger, or other negative emotions or it can mean numbness.  

I was sad a lot during my childhood.  I couldn't seem to control my emotions, and I hated it, and I've had this problem since as long as I can remember (since I was three or four years old.)  I wish I could have been one of the numb ones.  Then maybe people wouldn't have kept accusing me of faking it.  Apparently everyone thought I enjoyed crying over every trivial thing because it sure (/s) would make me more popular instead of have everyone avoid ""the weird unstable kid."" (Though I did have periods of numbness later.) I certainly didn't want to be special.  I just wanted an answer for what was wrong with me.

The point that I was making was that everyone seems eager to jump on the idea you either have depression or you're just faking it for fun.  Somehow it's never that someone is genuinely feeling bad, if only for a short time, but they can't tell what is wrong with them.  

And why is it I hear gobs of stories about how nobody believed them and then I hear gobs of stories about someone they knew that was ""obviously"" faking it?  Doesn't it ever cross your mind that the two might overlap?  People with depression or other mental illnesses can often act out because they need attention but they don't know how to ask for help or what kind of help they should ask for.  They just want the problem to go away.  And there are a few assholes, but assholes aren't immune to depression or feeling bad about themselves either.  Not everyone with depression is a perfectly mannered dainty wallflower."

unpopularopinion,feuwbho,t1_fete40m,1579390569.0,"This is just my opinion, but I don't believe that.  A diagnosis is a huge relief when people are struggling and wondering what is wrong with them and why can't they just fit in and act like everyone else?

I'm pretty sure that most people aren't faking their depression, although it doesn't mean that they have clinical depression: it means that they have a problem and they don't know how to address it.  They too can get help by seeing a therapist who can help them manage some of the stress in their life or get them through a tough time.  It could even help head off some deeper problems that they might face later in life.

I'd advise everyone to take their claims seriously.  If you feel like someone is taking advantage of you, it's okay to put up some boundaries, but just because they have bad behavior doesn't mean that they aren't suffering.  Not every depressed person is graceful and modest about it.  

As for mentally ill, that's becoming to be defined as how much it interferes with you living your life.  Being diagnosed as mentally ill but manageable isn't damaging.  It's certainly better than waiting until it gets much worse to address it.  If you notice how more people are talking about it, maybe it's because they're surviving it, and our progress towards mental illness is actually working to some degree, rather than it's just people who think it'll make them popular."

The point is it's not just serial killers or psychopaths that are capable of harming others.  A lot of murders are committed because the killer believes that they are good people but they have a good and justifiable reason for killing so and so, and anyone in their position would agree.  I can't help but despair at the lack of self-awareness many of these killers have in believing that they are exempt from the law because they have a good reason to break it -- because someone else insulted them or something.

We all are capable of inflicting harm, to some degree or another, and as such we have to learn to be conscious of how our own behavior affects others.

Whether they are capable of rehabilitating is a complicated issue, though I believe that many people could have avoided going down that path if things were different: if they had learned to control their anger better or had better guidance from the adults around them.

You're the one going through the adversity, not them, so you might have worries and other negative emotions about what happened and how it will affect your future.
