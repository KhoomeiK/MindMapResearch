So, a good country to start if you want to go with English speakers, to be honest English is pretty much the lingua franca everywhere, and most people speak it, but if you want to start in an English speaking country, SCOTLAND!  Sure, their English is kinda hard to understand, but that makes it a good bridge for traveling to more ""exotic"" place.  I quite like Scotland, that people seem a bit rough around the edges, but are really helpful and kindhearted.  Maybe, it is because we try to be so polite in the US, and when they just get to the point it puts me off.  So, the Highlands of Scotland, you know Braveheart shit!  Take a small trip there.  I did two weeksish hiking on the West Highland Way and Great Glen Way, and it is one of my favorite memories.  That is a hiking camping type O deal, if you are into it.  You can camp pretty much anywhere in Scotland as they have an old law called Everyman's Right, that allows you to roam and set up camp as long as you don't bother anyone.  But in its own right it is a wonderful country even by car!


So good luck with the interview, I bet a job in Alaska pays fat stacks!  That will help you fund your first trip.

I am super hype about getting others out there, so I am open for all questions.  Everything you state is true, ancient humans were natural travelers, and I think doing it meets some ancient desire.  I love traveling by myself, as I am forced to interact with the environment and the people that live there.  In the end you will have amazing memories and pride about what you have done.



First recommendation, Iceland, everyone should go once in their lives.  I spent about a month there, and have so many ideas about it for you!  The main thing, despite it being a bit spendy, the flights there are cheap if you are from the US.(I am assuming you are)  There are solo hikes that are world class, or stuff designed for solo travelers.  If you are out going, you could meet a group at a hostel and rent a car to drive around.  It is an amazing place to go!


A place like Bolivia is awesome as well, I tried to stretxh my budget one day, and it was less than 10usd for everything!  The salt flats there, and the volcano Tunupa is amazing!

He started playing his, I kid you not, digiredoo in the middle of the ""authentic"" ceremony, while the shaman waved branches and blew tobacco smoke while throat singing; I was kinda like ""Come on man, let the shaman do his thing!""  

The next day Spanish lady and me we getting devestated by moquitos, and the shaman had us walk out into the rain, to a tree by his house.  He grabbed some leaves, chewed them and indicated for us to rub it all over us.  The Spanish girl smiled and enthusiatically asked me if I knew what it was.  ""CITRONELLA, like the candle, haha!"" she explained.


Later we ate lunch, where I was asked if I wanted bush meat, and I agreed.  She was vegan and declined, while the English guy proceeded in cooking like 12 eggs.  She directed a question at him, ""Aye de mi!  How many eggs are you going to eat, this is not good for anyone much less a man your age.""  He stared at her and said, ""AS MANY AS I WANT!  I have lived one life for society, I am now living this life for myself!""

She went on to start talking about how beautiful it is here, the chicken taking shelter in the hut with us, the kids playing in the rain with that giant boa, the  pet turtle that crawles around in here. (Oh, donde es tortuga?  Where is the turtle!?)  She looked at my plate as I gestured with my eyes.....  She let out quick scream of exclaimation, and lamented something like, ""NO POOR TURTLE!""  They wanted me to stay, but I needed to get down river to Manaus; I should have though, Spanish girl was adorable, and the old dude had so much wisdom!

I got a canoe into the small village, as the shaman lived in the forest.

First travel tip, I bet you could get a 500$ ish flight to Iceland, and it should pretty much be a prerequsite for being human.  It is SO wonderful!  I spent almost a month there, and want to go back!


Be well!  I always like to encourage people to get out there!"
CampingandHiking,fem4w0d,t1_fem4d36,1579239854.0,"Hey, thanks!  Not rich, well not with money!  I just prioritize travel and making memories.   I have tons of stories though!  I am frugal to a fault, but for reasons!  You can get there as well!  My next step is finishing my grad degree in EFL/ESL language instruction, and getting to travel for my job.  Sure most only pay like 20k+usd, but I get to live all around the world!


Seriously, I drive a crap car, and eat rice and beans I make, or similar food at night!  Go for it though, I want to see you out on the trail!"
CampingandHiking,fem4eae,t1_feke1uy,1579239377.0,"I must be blessed, as I had no rain or biting bugs on the WHW and then did the Great Glen.  It is such a beautiful trek, and I am glad you got to experience it!!  That walk down Conic Hill, Loch Lomond at the end, Glen Coe; that would be enough, but the people, the whole atmosphere was amazing!


The Great Glenn is awesome as well, it starts in Ft. William!"
travel,fem2bzm,t1_fem1ur5,1579237449.0,"I love seeing all the volcanos around it, and the lovely lake!  (I also had a good blackjack night at the cassino there!)  Across the border, half a day bus ride, Bariloche is also awesome.  You can got to Mt. Tronador at the border, and it is so cool.  It thunders as the glacier breaks apart and seracs fall into the moraine lake; so cool!"
CampingandHiking,fem0n6b,t3_epu831,1579235959.0,"Elsewhere someone asked me about this trail, so:


 This is on the west end of Loch Ness, along the really cool Caladonian Canal that makes up the Great Glen Trek. It is a trek across Scotland that takes 4-5 days if you are at a good pace. You can camp almost anywhere as Scotland has a ""Everyman's Right"", to camp or roam as long as you are respectful.
Right after this part of the trail the ground began to rumble. I thought earthquake, as it is on a fault; Loch Ness monster? Then two RAF Tornados came screaming along the Loch super low. The second pilot was close enough to see me waving while I fumbled with my camera. The pilot did a wing waggle to acknowledge me, they were that close!!!



I made my way into dusk, and as I try to camp about 100 meters from any trail as to not disturb others experiences, I went deep into a fir forested moss covered treeline. I found an old stone wall in the forest, likely older than the trees themselves! I made camp, and sat down to read The Brothers Karamazov over dinner. My only worries were if I was sleeping on some ancient cemetery, and the Loch Ness Monster. I ended having a wonderful night of sleep on a moss bed at least 6 inches thick!



The Great Glen Way is an amazing trek, and starts right after the West Highland Way that I had just finished. I am not sure if the places or the people I met along the way were more wonderful; perhaps they are the same!"
travelpartners,felysjj,t1_felramb,1579234424.0,"Cool cool!  Um.... my number one is that it is super SPENDY!  As a backpackerI assume you will be hitting up the grocery stores instead of eating out, because everything costs so much!  My simple single person MSR tent pitch in an empty field in Lauterbrunner was 25usd a day!  They have facilities there though; shower, store, kitchen.


Speaking of Lauterbrunnen, I'm not sure where the Haute Route goes exactly, but you owe it to your memories to try to get to Lauternnen, as it might be close to the most beautiful place on Earth.  Sure the tourists are bad in town, but it is worth it, and they thin our as you venture out, and are almost nonexistent if you go to the far end of the valley.


My go to food was boiled eggs at the markets.  I stumbled open them because they were colored like Easter Eggs, but it was June!  They explained that is how we do them to tell the difference from ""raw"" eggs.  I thought that was kinda neat!


Anyways, I might have an answer or two for any Qs you got, so feel free to ask.  I only spent like 2-3 weeks, so I am no expert by any means!  But I know what I know!  Be well!"

I did Switzerland a bit a few years ago, and it is amazing!  I am an experienced backpacker, having done many solos all over the place.  That said, I might not be your ideal demographic being a M/37/USA.  Just thought I say hey, and wish you safe travels!"

I was satisfied when I got to see Villarica erupt and marked volcano off my bucket list, and than this happened in Puerto Varas!
