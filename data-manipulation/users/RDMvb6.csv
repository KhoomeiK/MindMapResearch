The most likely situation that can land a renter in this situation is they get behind on rent, the landlord files an eviction suit, but they leave voluntarily before the suit is final, so it is dismissed. Plenty of people due this in an attempt to steal a month of free rent. Just sign a new lease starting three months from now when your current lease is up in two months and simply stay because they know it will take longer than that for an eviction lawsuit to go thru. I think it should stay on their record so that they have a harder time doing this in the future. If you actually pay your rent (you know, don't steal) then you have no reason to be concerned about eviction records on your record.

Most replies to this will be anecdotal, so here is mine- I've been a skydiver for about 15 years and I seem to know about one friend or local jumper a year who manages to break a major bone. Seven dead friends so far, but two of those have been from BASE. One injury myself in \~1400 jumps. Pretty much everyone I know has gotten a couple scrapes and bruises along the way. If you do a couple thousand tandems, expect to put a lot more wear on your body too.

  
Whether or not you can do this for your whole life without major injury will depend on your attitude, skill, awareness, and a little bit of luck. Keep in mind the average skydiver does like 3 years in the sport and 500 jumps before moving on. If you plan on doing this for life, your chances of eventual injury go up. Reference the USPA annual fatality stats showing that the most common license among those who die is the D license, because these people are probably also making the most jumps."

SkyDiving,fen658d,t1_fen3pcz,1579277824.0,"Ya, there is a big different between line twists on a lightly loaded canopy (or military static line)  and a modern high performance elliptical and/or cross braced. Also differences on how they behave when it is twisted with the risers still symmetric vs twisted with the risers offset. If the risers are still symmetric, you may be able to get out of it by kicking. But if the risers are asymmetrically twisted (offset) bringing them together will allow that offset to be sorted out much quicker and hopefully before it starts to violently spin and get horizontal to the ground. Bringing them together is the more modern approach that works in both circumstances and should be taught over spreading and kicking, IMO.

Also, if line twists are a common occurrence for you, you should really look into what is causing that and fix it. I did \~300 jumps last year and had maybe two line twists. My WL is 1.7 on an elliptical canopy and I quickly got out of both of them before they could start spinning by pushing the risers together."

The vast majority of commuters drive less than 100 miles a day and if they make something not much bigger than a smart car but not so ugly I bet it would fly off the lots. Something like this probably only needs like a 60kwh battery pack to get >150 miles out of a charge, which is plenty for most urban drivers. Make it no frills and no options, let the aftermarket handle modding it. Maybe don't even include autopilot, just adaptive cruise control, which minimizes the amount of cameras that it needs. There is a huge market for cheap cars without a lot of features that people who don't make a lot of money could afford."

civilengineering,fdnpr39,t3_em99hs,1578590557.0,"Its worth noting that while engineers often specify a 28 day strength, most mix designs are chosen to hit that strength well before 28 days as no one has that long to wait around on a construction site. If you see a major slab pour, the forms are usually removed the next day after the pour is done and people are working on that slab not long after. You can order 3 day or 7 day breaks and the concrete is almost always making design strength by that time."

I have applied to roles with USACE for which I have 10 years of related experience and am a great fit for the role. I have worked side by side with USACE staff as a contractor on a major overseas project for over a year and have great references from within the corps itself, including upper management, who can personally testify that I did a great job for them. Have a PE and almost always at least get an interview if I apply elsewhere. But I still can't get a call back from USACE no matter what I do. I have applied at least 5 times over the last 7ish years. I have gotten interviews for other federal jobs.

I think my resume is getting filtered out by a computer before it is ever seen by a person. Some staff told me to rate myself a 10/10 on every question no matter what the truth is because a computer just filters out anything less. Do you know if this is true? I tried it on the last one and still got marked as ""not referred"". Only interested in living in Colorado but willing to travel for projects. Any tips at all on applying would be great, thanks!"
triathlon,fdi3ale,t3_eli51x,1578434969.0,"Its the best gym I've ever been to by far. Well worth the price of admission. Mine in Colorado is around $90/ month and when you consider that you get amenities far above what budget gyms offer, its worth it. Consider that a smaller gym near me costs about $30/ month and has basically just cardio machines, weights, and a sauna. Lifetime has 4x the amount of those things, then adds 3 pools, yoga, rock wall, lockers with keys, steam room, running and tri group training, cycling and body pump classes... the list goes on. If you want a budget gym, sure go to any of the cheaper competitors. But if you want variety, it really is a great value for the money and its so nice to get all of those in one location."

A background in yoga and gymnastics or any other finesse sport that teaches body awareness is going to be more beneficial than anything that involves throwing a ball or riding something with a motor. Also helps to have a stack of cash.

You should probably not learn to skydive on your own if you have a history of panicking or shutting down in stressful situations, blaming others for your failures, not listening to teachers, or an unwillingness to learn from other people's mistakes.

civilengineering,fden82n,t1_fdemezg,1578342577.0,"I guess it depends. Saying ""Bob didn't work out at my last company because Joe thought he was awkward"" is not really useful feedback as this may just be Joe's opinion. If you have demonstrable, quantifiable things that he did poorly, sure go ahead and say that but that is different than just saying ""some people don't like him"", which it seems like here. Not everyone on the planet gets along and I've seen people that just get rubbed the wrong way to easily. Maybe ""Joe"" was like that."
civilengineering,fdeligy,t3_ekyplr,1578341563.0,"There is approximately zero realistic chance of having it ""blow up in your face"" if you give an overly optimistic review to someone who ends up not working out for a particular job. What exactly do you think is going to happen, his new employer (your company) chews you out because they had a bad time working with him? Interpersonal issues are complicated and someone who doesn't get along or fit in at one company might just do fine somewhere else. IMO, you should entirely avoid mentioning any ""company fit"" issues when giving references as this is so subjective and makes you look petty. Seems like you really screwed over someone who thought they could rely on you."
