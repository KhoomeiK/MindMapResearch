Her brother, family, friends... everyone is far away right now. I’m all she has. 

She’s an emotional wreck and is already anxious and mildly suicidal.

She has direction but a poor sense of purpose. 

And its more than just what I can think to express now.

I do feel very guilty though and plan to break it off, but for the time being lay low and help both of us just form better versions of ourselves."
