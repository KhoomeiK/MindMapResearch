Showerthoughts,ffhhbe1,t1_ffhgp6x,1579935231.0,That’s exactly where this shower thought is coming from. They have to travel between planets and different parts of the planets meaning they have to adjust to the timezone of that part of the planet. This isn’t something only you know.
AskReddit,ffevg0m,t1_ffevcfl,1579867242.0,People like you ruin that sub. This wasn’t suspicious or specific.

Caitlynmains,ffbgxtr,t1_ff9scjx,1579764809.0,"One tricking any champion is fine. One tricking an op meta champ just because they are op is different. Most roles you can get away with one-tricking any champion even if they get nerfed, unless they get completely gutted."
todayilearned,ffb6r38,t1_ffb5nf6,1579753297.0,If they were different sized then aren’t they still wasting shoes? How are they trading the shoes if they aren’t the same size?
gaming,ffb5ere,t1_ffb2dwp,1579752261.0,That’s refueling yourself not healing yourself.
CrappyDesign,ffb4xp9,t1_ff74u93,1579751903.0,I mean it’s not really Satan’s name.
CrappyDesign,ff5r3mg,t1_ff5owwp,1579606913.0,Yes and no. Lucifer isn’t a name and neither is morning star really a nickname. The place morning star comes from that is talking about Satan (and/or the king of Babylon) is in Isaiah 14:12. Jesus calls himself the bright morning star in revelation 22:16.
Showerthoughts,ff2r26m,t1_ff2oir3,1579520242.0,That’s not how it works.
Showerthoughts,feqiyc0,t1_feqgoa4,1579342436.0,You’re picking at nothing. The thing you responded “yes true” to already explained what you just tried to pick at. An incomplete amount of whales is less than 1. A full whale is exactly one. Op used it exactly as it should have been used. You’re just attempting to pick at it for the sake of being contrary.
gaming,fepu9hz,t1_fepizez,1579331500.0,I know you meant as trophies. There isn’t a single non video game character as a trophy. Otherwise they can start adding things like Goku and literally anything else.
gaming,fep0rkx,t1_femvyp5,1579309575.0,They are characters that appear in a video game. They aren’t original video game characters. Did you read the first half of my first sentence only? There has not been a single non video game original character added in to smash ever.

gaming,femnvfq,t1_feme8xi,1579264107.0,Donald and goofy aren’t video game characters. Are there any support trophies that are not video game characters? They wouldn’t even ask Disney for those characters because they originate from a cartoon.
gaming,femnbs2,t1_femkouq,1579263538.0,"Battle passes feel pretty bad when you miss a day or if you stop playing and try to come back at some point. They’re good if you can commit your time to a game, but they shouldn’t completely replace the ability to buy cosmetics in a game."
Neverbrokeabone,femm11z,t1_feme073,1579262053.0,I wouldn’t use bubble wrap as a comparison to try saying how harmless it is. Once bubble wrap pops it’s done and can’t be repaired. That’s like the opposite of what’s happening.

Showerthoughts,fejepz0,t3_epbose,1579170519.0,The parking space isn’t making money for itself. The business is taking all the profit just like they take from people. Minimum wage worker gets paid a small amount of money. Parking space gets paid nothing.
Showerthoughts,feir4ja,t1_fehea1z,1579145110.0,"I understand what the core idea of his statement was, repeating it doesn’t make it true. 3rd top comment quotes George Lucas. https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/eovijj/when_the_jedi_believe_that_anakin_is_the_one_who/fegf21i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"
Showerthoughts,fegfx6c,t1_fefl62j,1579091423.0,How is he not 100% wrong? His assumption on how the balance of the force works is wrong. It has nothing to do with number of force users.
Showerthoughts,fegflzh,t1_fegcnkf,1579091120.0,How is it the point of the movie when it is wrong? You and op both misunderstand what the balance means. It doesn’t mean there is an equal amount of good and bad force users. The unbalance comes from dark side only.

Showerthoughts,fdjpxjm,t1_fdji683,1578482835.0,Foods are named for their uses not for their scientific makeup. That’s why we have so many “misnomers”
Showerthoughts,fdgj5i9,t1_fdg4jcs,1578398945.0,"Pretty sure the reason zombie movies don’t even use the word zombie is that zombies are magic. Zombies originally  are dead people brought back to life by magic/voodoo. So a supernatural zombie plague wouldn’t really be weird, that’d be exactly how it should be."

explainlikeimfive,fddfs8o,t1_fdde9gi,1578310316.0,He said “my physics students” which would mean the students in the physics class that he teaches. I don’t know how you assume physics degree from what he said.
explainlikeimfive,fdde04m,t1_fdddbmk,1578307847.0,He didn’t specify which kind of physics class he was teaching. Why are you assuming he’s teaching a high level class?

todayilearned,fd22jbe,t1_fd1nhyg,1578140681.0,I’d define an accident as dropping something and it mixing with something else and then you try it. Intentionally putting stuff together in the hopes it might taste good isn’t an accident. I don’t see how “technically” they were all accidents.
funny,fd1zpmg,t1_fczpvz6,1578139355.0,"But my brain did notice. Isn’t it just supposed to be that your brain is able to understand what it’s supposed to say, not that it won’t notice?"
Showerthoughts,fczgue1,t1_fcz5ihj,1578100953.0,"Which video games are you saying you are objectively the bad guy? And what makes you say that most are like this? Don’t use Skyrim or other open world games as examples, because most games aren’t open world."
tifu,fctzt9w,t1_fctwduk,1577967481.0,The overall takeaway is that this verse wasn’t talking about creation. You shouldn’t be using this verse to interpret the time used in genesis. This verse isn’t saying that God is confused by time.
dataisbeautiful,fcjxbmz,t1_fcjugvv,1577709134.0,"Is New York the only place in the US you’ve been in? And do you mean just the city or did you travel throughout the state? Most places in the US will be very different from New York City. 

Eating healthy should always be cheaper than eating unhealthy because for the most part it’s just how much you eat, and eating less should cost less. 

Idk where you live but do you eat out for all your meals? That’s going to be expensive either way whether you’re eating healthy or not. It sounds like you only went out to eat when you were in the US."

gaming,fc8c2ro,t1_fc868j0,1577531547.0,"5 seems a bit young. Do they normally play video games? I played the first Luigi’s mansion and I’m positive I wouldn’t have figured it out at 5. I don’t know how this one compares in difficulty, but it doesn’t seem like a game that would be easy. For it being scary, as long as you don’t have the volume too loud and you have lights on it shouldn’t be something they can’t handle."
