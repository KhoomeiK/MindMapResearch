I do business and marketing at uni so here is a quick rule of thumb: Take how much you think a marketing campaign costs. Double it. Now times it by ten.

A 100k subcriber count youtubers sponsorship can net around 10,000 Dollars a pop at the high end. Id say everage is around 5,000. Thats per sponsorship.

Now a million subscriber channel? Whooo boy they get real expensive.

Now lets say you do a sponsorship maube once every week. Thats a looooot of money.

You are a stakeholder in ever company you buy from, your actions determine the companies axtions. It is not the other way around.

If you want coke to produce less plastic bottles, then buy less plastic bottles. They have alternatives, both glass and cans. Buy them instead.

Do not blame a company for your own irresponsible purchasing habits.

Yes The Coca-Cola company is a fucking awful company that has done a lot of harm to the planet. But guess who finds them? You. Guess who decides what they do? You.

Either stop buying coca cola products or purchase cans or glasses of coke.


Tldr: Stop blaming companies for your own behaviour, instead change the buying behaviour of you and the people around you. Companies will respond appropriately to get you back, in turn helping the planet.
