PlasticSurgery,fdot7z5,t1_fdn59go,1578612343.0,ahhh i see. yeah i'm pretty sure mine is genetics too since my sister and i both have the same problem when we're not really overweight. thank you for replying~!
socialanxiety,fdmt160,t1_fdmsrea,1578564356.0,thank you : ) hope yours is too~!
PlasticSurgery,fdmszjx,t3_elvxli,1578564291.0,omg the results look amazing! this might be a personal thing to ask but may I ask if your weight was something that could have resulted in the double chin issue. I'm asking because I have a similar problem with my double chin (genetics) but I'm 100 pounds so losing weight isn't something that could get rid of it. I was wondering if yours may have been genetics too. Because if it's still possible to get rid of it despite genetics this is definitely something I want to do in the future!!
socialanxiety,fdmsqup,t3_em1qd6,1578563942.0,I'm terrified to take the required speech class when I already have problems with regular participation in class :(
