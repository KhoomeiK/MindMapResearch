It's that it's not as economically good as **renewables**. Governments should have invested heavily in nuclear plants around 1990-2000.

It encourages both party infighting and partisanship, limits voter choice, and entrenches the existing parties. Going to go into each of those points in greater detail below, but tl;Dr primaries are a hot mess 

The primaries don't really entrench two-party, that's caused by first past the post voting.

>Party infighting. This one was pretty noticeable in the last election on both sides, where the Clinton/Sanders and pro-Trump/anti-Trump splits still exist to this day (though the Republicans have mostly gotten round to the pro Trump camp). The whole point of parties is to gather like-minded senators and politicians into a bloc so that they can actually get things done, but they've spent as much time fighting each other as fighting the other party, and it makes it hard to work together when you spend up to a quarter of your time running attack campaigns against each other. 

Party infighting tends to arise from the two-party system even absent primaries - in Australia, for example, the standing members of a political party elect the leader of their party, and the leader of the party with the most seats in parliament is the prime minister. Hower, no prime minister has yet to serve out a complete term for the past decade and a half, because factional disputes within each of the two major parties have led to leadership spills (i.e. different wings of the current ruling party have called for an in-party vote about who should lead the party, and the then-current leader has lost said vote and been replaced, so the replacement is the new prime minister).

As long as there are only two dominant parties, there will be different views within each party as to particular policies or ideologies, and that will create infighting as each view's proponents jostle for control of that policy.

>Limiting voter choice and entrenching existing parties. Because the primaries are such a large part of the campaign, the 2 major parties get months of coverage and whoever wins their respective primary basically gets those months of advertisement that is denied to anybody else. Also because of how the voting system works (which tbf is another topic), a party can't run multiple candidates and if a candidate isn't selected to be the presidential candidate, they can't run, even if they're extremely popular, and depending on how harsh the faction infighting got during the primaries, those voters might choose to not vote or even vote for the other party out of spite.

This actually gives **voters** more choice - it gives **candidates** less choice.

Compare to Australia and many other western parliamentary democracies - voters do not get to choose who leads a political party - the party chooses itself, and the voters get to choose which party of the two or more gets to represent their constituency.

Primaries let the voters pick who will lead the party, not just which party will rule the country."

As I said - I'm responding to the question OP asked, not the question you wish they asked.
