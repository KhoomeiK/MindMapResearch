dogs,ffb2z9x,t1_ffb2qbr,1579750475.0,I just checked. It’s a medium but he has an unusually large chest for his breed and it fits a bit loose. Also I think I bought it at a local store that lets you bring in your dog and tried it on. I’ve had it 3-4 yrs so I don’t recall exactly.

I have this for my 50lb Viszla and works great. I love the handle on the back to use to quickly pull him out if harms way.  Pulls over head and snaps on the sides.  Easy on and off."
