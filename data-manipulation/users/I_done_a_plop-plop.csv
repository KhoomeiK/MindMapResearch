In the encounter and story she is a general and not an idiot, she has Wizard courtiers casting Glitterdust etc., but she's still reliant on magic, other people's magic. 

Sure, if she catches you at the wrong end of her sword, she'll beat the shit out of you, she can slice you up, but she's using actions not protecting herself from my flying, invisible, Ice Form Sorcerer casting Enervation on her etc. 

She's tough, but not built like a PC. What Dex would your level 20 Swashbuckler have? 36, right? Max it, make it that you can't miss and can't get hit. She has 23 or something."
