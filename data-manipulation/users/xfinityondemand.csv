bisexual,ffef24b,t1_ffe8rnv,1579845573.0,"I'm with Spock. No need to hide it, but there's no reason for a megaphone either. Do what works for you and if someone asks, just be honest. There's really no reason for any more or any less. 



Have fun, be safe, do you."
bisexual,ffeesei,t3_et1k2h,1579845294.0,Sexual attraction is like 90% girls but romantically it's 90% boys. I'd much rather give head to a guy than a girl though so it flip flops for me in pretty much every level lol.
OldSchoolCool,ffbdtfd,t1_ffb97iy,1579761073.0,Literally my entire family.
LeanManufacturing,ffacoaf,t1_ffa8z4s,1579732424.0,"I'm not sure about you, but I have headphones in most the day. It doesn't take long to knock out books while you work but I find I have to listen to them a few times to catch all the info."
LeanManufacturing,ff9u9l6,t3_esar6m,1579721464.0,Paul Akers 2 second lean. I listen to it a few times a year on Spotify (most of his material is available for free in audio form). I definitely recommend listening to the whole book a few times to get the most out of it. Good luck.
trashy,ff2bob1,t1_ff2abs8,1579499853.0,If you're in/around a decent sized city it's fairly impressive how quick they can get a helicopter in the air. It's expensive but so is trashing a dozen squad cars bombing through a cornfield.
AskReddit,fephoqz,t3_eq48n1,1579320766.0,"I found a picture in a family photo album of a guy in a KKK outfit and a guy in a Reagan mask wearing an SS officer hat, swastika and all. No one knows. Every family gathering is now spot the Nazi(s?)."
politics,feiy655,t1_feixrr8,1579150500.0,"""If a continuous flow of new information keeps coming out, that looks damning to Trump it is increasingly difficult for all GOP Senators to ignore.""

Immoral maybe, but not difficult if everyone else is ignoring it. It's always easier to go with the flow, and as long as the keep pretending that the flow is strong... It will be."
news,feixuht,t1_fehe203,1579150226.0,"""Prosecutors, on the other hand, have immense power over defendants’ fates: whether or not to 
charge a defendant with a sentencing enhancement triggering an LWOP sentence is within their discretion""

Why are we leaving this up to the prosecutors? It's their job to prosecute not judge. Blaming the prosecutor is like blaming the sheriff for executing an eviction."
bipolar,fcnowbg,t1_fcnopim,1577815635.0,"I'm pretty cautious about my bipolar and sexuality. I don't actively hide either, but I don't take about it or made it known. It'd have to be a pretty open church, definitely no old school Catholic sermons like childhood."
bipolar,fcmgpl6,t3_ehxnwx,1577774600.0,"I got this way, just but with music. My passion was/is Motorsports. Cars/motorcycles/jet skis/etc. I got burnt out real fast working at a Motorsports shop and also keeping up with my own stuff outside of work. After a crazy few years I have found a line of work where part of my job is building things and I dig it. Being in an apartment I don't have a garage so I cant really express myself through projects that I like, but I'm working towards a house where I can... One day. 

My point is, especially at 22, don't feel like it all needs to happen. NOW. Life is a long road, if you're burnt out take a break. 

As a side note: think about the drinking, at least be aware of why you want that vodka. 

(I can't say any of this is right, it's just my experience)"
bipolar,fcmfzxg,t3_ehw82h,1577773850.0,"I have one friend, pretty sure he'll be moving cross country soon. I work salary so I voluntarily work most weekends just because. I'm not a believer but I've recently given serious thought to joining a church. I'm not sure why, but I think it'd give a sense of community and opportunities to help people. 

I don't have any answers, but I'm right there with ya."
AskMen,fcklxbv,t1_fckeisz,1577728192.0,"I don't think it's about treating a hook up the same as a girlfriend. I think it's the fact that the boys will never know the hook up, but they'll probably know the gf. Don't need the boys looking at your girlfriend thinking about that kick-ass thing she does with her tongue."
DaveRamsey,fcistuo,t3_egwztz,1577668977.0,"Dave Ramsey or not, a $350 car is just about never the answer. I've done it, my friends have done it, I've owned a lot of cars, no $350 car is worth it."
