Some  have had toes amputated, legs amputated, gone blind, etc.  Soda is definitely not worth it.  I have one who had both legs amputated above the knee.  I just can't imagine going through that."

fatlogic,fd3i06k,t3_ejgni9,1578158468.0,"I'm late, but I am reading the book ""How Not to Die"" and decided to do the daily dozen the book suggests, in addition to CICO.  I've been able to lost weight in the past with CICO while still eating junk food, but this time I want to overhaul my diet completely.  I'm vegan anyway, but a lot of junk foods are vegan so it is easy to gain weight even with a vegan diet.  I am going to focus on eating to live, and not eating things because they taste good.  I work with people with disabilities, and I have seen so many people have amputations due to diabetes, or they are confined to a wheelchair at 50 because of health problems related to being overweight.  I already have high blood pressure so I need to make lasting changes."
