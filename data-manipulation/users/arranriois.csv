D&D made something great (admittedly by adapting something great) and for a while it literally seemed like they could do no wrong from a money making perspective. 

Each season of GoT brought more fans, new money and would call people back to rewatch. It really managed to cross all sorts of social strata and become a phenomenon. 

Toward the end cracks very clearly starting to emerge. Corners were cut, some sour notes were hit, the writing floundered a bit but a lot of people were still hooked and hopeful on the ending. 

At this point HBO COULD have stepped in and said ""no we're getting someone else"" or exercised more control, but, why would they? In many ways it seems like they had their concerns (as seen by their desire for more episodes) but they also trusted D&D to do what they had been doing-keeping the gravy train running. 

Instead they run the train off the tracks and into the local hospital.

Because either
1. The kingdom was rich and that's why you want it.

Firstly, they acknowledge that Juliet really is way too young to be married in the play. The elder Capulet himself says: 

""She hath not seen the change of fourteen years. 

 Let two more summers wither in their pride. 

Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride""

When challenged by Paris that women do wed early Capulet also says ""too soon marr'd, are those so early made."" 

The implication in the play is that sure you can marry that young, but it's weird and abnormal even among the nobility. 

Secondly, English teachers have no business talking about history and no specific clout. They're *not* even close disciplines. 

If you're interested, Romeo and Juliet didn't even start with Shakespeare. It was based on earlier works where both youths were roughly the same age (16-18 depending on versions) and they were *still* considered too young to marry."

unpopularopinion,fe04eir,t1_fdzzkyk,1578802793.0,"Well...no. there's plenty of other systems of ethics that do not require a higher power to define right and wrong and they don't all rely on popularism. 

Plus, even if in theory that was not the case, in practicality through both history and across the world even religious organisations and states are not always consistent in enforcing their laws. So even the alleged higher power in this instance clearly does not apply. 

But that's irrelevant anyway. The point is saying be nice and respect each other doesn't work well when one person is advocating hate. 

Would you really just walk by someone, for instance, claiming that say, native american people are sinful by their very nature and should not be allowed to marry each other? 

Fuck no, such people should be called out and dragged through the mud."
unpopularopinion,fe03ca5,t1_fdzw06z,1578802033.0,"That's not true, actually. 

Modern medicine made death in childhood less likely and death from old age less likely, but a healthy adult could easily still live passed the point of fertility. 

Having a child that young is also incredibly dangerous as the body is not fully developed. 

All this is compounded by the fact that modern people actually reach sexual maturity earlier than previous gens (as part of a general descending trend likely linked to better nutrient availability). 

So a 14 year old in, for instance, the middle ages is not only actually definitely *not* middle aged. But they would be physically less well developed than a 14 year old today."
