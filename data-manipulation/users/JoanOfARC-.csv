Homogeneous nucleation is allot harder to occur and requires a larger change in energy than heterogeneous. Heterogeneous occurs on the walls of the container and impurities in the substance, this all has to do with something called surface energy. Certain substances like bismuth can undergo supercooling, (not freezing when we think they should) because not many things cause heterogeneous nucleation in bismuth so it can go lower because sometimes it has to nucleate homogeneously."
