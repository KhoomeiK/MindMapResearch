We do have that with cigarettes. ""Here is cigarette, here is cell, in this petri dish you see cell react to cigarette like this and you can actually see the cancer form.""   


That linked article connects obesity to diabetes. What I'm talking about is direct link between sugar and diabetes. AGAIN NOT SAYING SUGAR INTAKE IS FINE! Not at all! We have enough circumstantial evidence and studies to know that yes, sugar intake leads to obesity leads to diabetes without hesitation. I'm a small person, fit, etc so not defending HAES. Just defending proper science. HAES are science deniers and if we say something not true, that gives them power. So (that I am aware of) there are no studies with a direct link of sugar intake to diabetes as there is say of cigarettes to cancer. We rely on indirect links. So it is important that we educate HAES on the reliability of indirect links instead of ""sugar makes diabetes"" which it doesn't, directly, that we have found (that I know of or can find)."

xxfitness,fcnrtvd,t3_ei10z0,1577817224.0,"My community has a fitness center which is only open to local home owners or long term tenants, though it seems during the holidays the rule is relaxed. A lot of people rent their homes here, big vacation rental market, and I've seen a lot of new faces and heard questions that suggest the person is only here for a bit. I don't care, get your swole on! The homeowner renting the house out is still paying fees so <shrug>. As long as they are respectful to the rest of us, it ain't no thing.  


The fitness center closes at noon on Sundays. Today, I forgot that and showed up just at noon with a man right in front of me. The front desk woman, sweet as could be, always polite, in her early 20s, small framed, quiet spoken, informed us the gym closes at noon - laughing at me because this is far from the first time. I never know what day it is! I just head out walking to the gym after breakfast and my morning routine. Some days that is 7 am, sometimes 3 pm. When the gym was closed for a week for updating, I showed up THREE times having forgotten. My schedule is hectic and I'm going for walks anyway! It's become our running joke. (punny!)  


The man argued, saying there were other people still there. She said they were informed and wrapping up. He said he should be able to stay til they left, she explained that she had wiped down all the machines and is only paid until 12:05. He said he won't be longer than they were. She repeated the fitness center is closed.   


After her first reminder it was closed, I had turned to leave, but upon hearing him, I stayed to make sure she was safe. I repeated, ""It's closed"". He ignored us both and walked in and sat down at a machine. I asked her how she felt about the exchange and she said it wasn't ok. I asked her if she wanted me to approach him, wanting her to know she is in charge of how this proceeds. She said she was afraid he would become more angry. I offered to stay until he left, and be the one to tell him it it closed. She agreed, noting that made her feel safer. I'm not much bigger than her, but I'm older and a LOT meaner having put up with 20 more years of handling men that think ""no"" from a woman is meaningless.  


She told the only other two people there that it was time at 12:02. They respectful left immediately. I began to approach him but he was cleaning up. All in all he got maybe 8 full pushes in on the chest press machine. He left and I watched, then told her to have a good day. She thanked me for staying and I followed him. He was in his car by the time I got out and I watched where he drove. Unfortunately it was into the more populated part of the community and I soon lost sight. I walked the long way home, looking for his car. I don't know what I would have down if I found him. I have his license plate imprinted on my brain, though. I am tempted to find him, but I wouldn't knock on his door. He's already shown his complete disregard for women. I might write a note and leave it on his door, where he'll see it but maybe his wife or kids will too? I don't know. For now, I'm venting here, and will inform fitness center management tomorrow about him so they can handle him if he makes further issues.   


I don't care the context. When a woman says no, that's the end of it. His disregard for her, her job, her feeling of security was maddening. She was put in an uncomfortable position. There were only two other people in the gym. What if he had refused to leave, or tried worse, after those two left? Guaranteed those thoughts were in her mind. Her hands were shaking. What about when he comes back? I hope he's a holiday person and not a new long term tenant. He did tell her he was coming back tomorrow in a tone that was almost more threat than informative. We all know she isn't the only woman he's treated this way. He saw she wasn't going to fight, and took advantage of it. Human garbage.   


You may say I should have spoke up more, but a woman in her position needs to handle it as she sees fit. It wouldn't have helped for me to become aggressive. What did help was her knowing I was there. My body language doing its best to say I WILL match his aggression, but I won't escalate. I'm not sure I handled it right, but at her age, having someone back me up by my side instead of taking over the fight was always more helpful in the long run. She gets to find her voice in a safer space."

My mother was in a wheelchair for much of her life. It wasn't her doing. She was bipolar and was given a nearly lethal dose of lithium in the hospital which destroyed her ability to walk and mostly talk.

Because of these things (and others, like ... reality) I take excellent care of my body. I want to do all in my power to avoid developing type II. So I eat well and exercise, my weight is low, my sugar intake is low. Because.. science. And I walk and hike and use my body because my mom wasn't able to do so. She loved life and died way too young. I will do all I can to avoid that. I'm already considerably more healthy than both my parents at my age through factors they didn't choose.

[Literally reams of science contradict what this person says](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=diabetes+obesity&btnG=). Yes, once you have cancer, extra weight can help one survive chemo but now with medicinal marijuana and newer cancer treatments, weight loss isn't as big of a factor as it once was. So even that is no longer a major variable in survival of chemo and radiation. Yes. Type II is 100% linked to weight.  My brother works in the field. In their business they had several hundred test subjects that used monitors and an app to strictly control diet. 98% of the type II subjects are off insulin. That's.. there's no arguing that. Especially as his observations are repeated again and again by other groups.

Meanwhile, I had two obese friends die this year, both in their 40s, for weight related reasons. Another friend had to have his gallbladder out and have knee surgery because his body can't handle his weight. Two were diagnosed type II in the last two years. One traveled to San Francisco and had to go home early because walking the hills even a short distance was too much. Life is better when you are a healthy weight. Full stop.

So no, fuck that. Obesity needs to be a word, and it needs to be addressed. I am a firm believer that weight loss for obese people involves psychological treatment, as an unhealthy relationship with food is a major player. In addition, the hatred of 'diet' and exercise needs to be resolved.  I have sympathy for people that struggle, but not for those that deny, ignore science, make excuses, and blame those of us that work our asses off (literally) to avoid excess weight.
