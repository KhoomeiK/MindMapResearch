And most of the men deal with it, en masse - some because they feel they can do no better, some because they don't want to get their ass handed to them economically via child support / alimony, and some because they're just lazy and / or insecure.

Not to mention Tony fundamentally being completely and totally unsympathetic about Chris working hard to do his job while staying away from the Bing and various ""triggers"" (the beer at Satriale's), and Tony comparing Chris' hard core drug addiction to the fact that Tony ""can't eat Eggplant"".
