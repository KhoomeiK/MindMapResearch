selfimprovement,fchzqag,t1_fcfbykm,1577656043.0,"Hey, I can actually help you a bit with that!

You did great on reflecting where you want to work on yourself! That is a trait not so common :)

Well, self esteem, or described differently, standing behind your own persona, is a thing that come with time. But can be very clearly worked on!

Just ask yourself why are you not happy with who you are? What kind of person you would like to be? Somebody that gifts others joy? Somebody with a successful work path?
Shape a kind of person in your head, how you would like to be. 
Once you define the things that are important to you in your life, start working on them. Cause once the difference of who you are and who to be becomes smaller, you can begin to stand for the person you are. And once you can stand for the person you are, you can be proud for the person you have become!
That was my approach for feeling better for the person I am. The process is not simple, but baby steps, will make it possible. 

I guess comparing yourself is a social trap that is really hard to escape. I guess being proud for who you are will help you to stop comparing yourself with others to some extend.

I hope you are at least a bit satisfied with my advice. I wish you the best for your future and best efforts in building a health self esteem!
And a happy new year, too, that will hopefully be the Kickstarter for a better health :)"
selfimprovement,fchxi60,t1_fcf1jog,1577655284.0,"Hey, first of all, cheers to you for being so reflective!

As I see it, you kind of have high expectations for yourself! That is normally a great thing, but it may cause some problems sometimes.

Are those expectations really yours, or are you trying to fit them into a certain image in your surrounding? I am really sorry if that sounded stupid, but it’s a thing that happened to me.
I had a couple friends, or rather a group of friends, that I would understand with perfectly fine. But never got the feeling to actually be part of the group. It just felt that I had to adjust myself and do this and that cause it was expected. 
In the end, I have no contact to that group of friends whatsoever. 
But I got to meet new people, which instantaneously gave me the feeling that they understood me, including my rather exhausting traits. Those people are sticking around me till today, even when I’m in the wrong mood.
What I’m trying to say here, gather people around you or explain to them, that you are the way you are, and even if you can change to some extend, you shouldn’t just because of them.

For the second topic, I would recommend the same thing as above, but with a twist:
Don’t think over it too much. It’s not really a science you can approach with logic. Sure, manners and humour will help you a lot, but in the end, it is coincidence who you meet. 
Just be patient, and keep looking. Some meet their soulmate in primary school without real effort, while others have to struggle for years. In the end, it’s just luck or coincidence, doesn’t matter how you want to state it.

But nonetheless, I wish you the best for the next year! Give yourself some breaks and try to reflect on things that matter to you personally :)"
selfimprovement,fchuczq,t1_fcck7xy,1577654238.0,"Hey, I guess that is just how life goes. People come and people go, those that we have or want to have close too.
Well, I know it’s more like a bandaid to an open wound, but let me tell you this:
If you had to spend almost a year to date somebody, the hassle is just not worth it.
I am more than sure, that you will find somebody, that will appreciate you for who you are and how you are way faster than a year, and will express it more clearly for you. This will not only make the whole thing easier, but also a lot more pleasant and natural. 
Just don’t let yourself be brought down by such an incident! And in the end, time heals all wounds, even if that sounds stupid right now
I wish you a great new year and good luck on your future path! That it may be the best :)"
selfimprovement,fcfzpnh,t1_fcce6nw,1577635171.0,"So I guess you live the live of an extrovert person, but with the struggles of approaching new people. And let me tell you one thing: that’s the majority of earths population! 

I would recommend you to scout out for a specific event, for example a New Year’s Eve party, a “chill house” club night, a specific event that is going on in your town etc. These are more with the approach that everyone goes to them, so people and groups are way more open to interact with each other. 
Cause on usual nights, people go out with a group of people they have agreed to meet earlier. 

But once you get to go out, look for that event or party, go there, and just order a drink. U don’t have to talk to anybody, you don’t have to look for anybody, just go and grab a drink. That’s the first step. 
Once I actually in, just enjoy ur time there, maybe on some occasion you get to talk to somebody, maybe not. That is up to luck.
But actually being in there and drinking increases the chances enormously:)

Well, to the second topic:
It happens :|
People come and people go from our lives. If it changes into a hassle in the long run, it’s not worth it, trust me :) 
For that weird uncomfortable feeling in your guts: don’t be worried that she is the one.
You ARE going to find someone else that is willing to invest their time and willing to give you the feeling of being noticed. 
Cause if you have to work your ass off for a simple answer, imagine the hassle for an evening out hahaha.

I wish you the best and good luck for meeting the right persons in your live and on your evenings out :)"
selfimprovement,fcfwnny,t1_fccbzob,1577634400.0,Kudos to you! Wish you a strong will and the best efforts in pursuing your goals!
selfimprovement,fcfwec7,t1_fccad2g,1577634315.0,"Well, I would start of with reflecting and understand what kind of person u want to be. What would help you to break those circles, is a point of view onto your life that gives you a reason to stop. Cause why should u quit now? If it is what makes you -long term- happy, go ahead. But if it won’t make you happy, why keep doing it? 

If you strive to be a better person, you could start of with a healthy body, cause a health body hosts a healthy mind :)
And that is more than just a metaphor. These healthy habits will, I’m pretty certain, help you get rid of the other unhealthy habits.
Always keep in mind who u are striving to be.
Once that difference between who you want to be and who your are is no more, your inner feeling of fulfilling should slowly show. And that feeling is a strong tool to handle illnesses like depression or anxiety. I’m speaking here from experience :)

Kudos to you for being already so self reflective! I wish u the best and stay strong! And a happy new year :)"
selfimprovement,fcfu45t,t1_fcez9gx,1577633793.0,"I’m rooting for you! 
I can recommend something new as a break for the thoughts.
I started actually enjoying classic music, especially Einaudi or producing some music myself.
Heads up and a happy new year :)"
selfimprovement,fceli47,t1_fccftni,1577621582.0,"God I don’t how to react. Legal advice is actually a topic I’m completely lost at. 

Injustice is a horrible feeling. The worst part is that no one expects it... 
Don’t let it doubt you though. 
I don’t really know the situation you are in, but if a person would feel such a need to invest so much effort into staying away from ... I would just think about my own health and how such a person is supposed to help me in my life... cause I don’t think that person will help.
I would say, let them have it. Just walk away if possible. I imagine that would be one of the hardest things in life, but i think I wouldn’t be the first that would need to do it. And if somebody else did it already, why shouldn’t I be able to...
If the order is for your child, get in touch with it if it truly thinks that way. I can’t imagine a harder step to take, but if it really thinks that way, there isn’t much of a choice neither.

I don’t really know what to say, as you might have noticed.
I guess that is my point of view best described. 
Thank you for giving me to opportunity to see the world from a different perspective. I wish u strength and only the best."
selfimprovement,fcehy99,t1_fcdywk3,1577620622.0,"Hey man. So... let’s approach all of this in baby steps.

First thing is that urgent feeling that you don’t like yourself... and I think you are missing a small bit I actually never noticed too.
You don’t like yourself, but it’s because you don’t like how you are. And as you probably noticed yourself, it’s a huge difference. Cause you can actually change how and who you are. 
As much as I know, that feeling comes from the difference between who you are and how you are. 
You don’t have to be perfect, and maybe give yourself a break too :)
Think for yourself, who u want to be, why you want to be like that and how to achieve that goal. Then, slowly but surely, you can approach the goal of becoming who you want to be. As in my case, the feeling seemingly unnoticeably faded and now I merely feel it. I know you can do it.

Now to the second issue I think I noticed.
That forgetfulness of yours or that feeling of being lost. I would recommend to you some exercises for your temporary memory :) there are some great methods. 
Another possibility is to get a planer, for example google calendar. 
While adding useful notes, I can use it to recall something I wanted to remember. Getting used to using it takes time but it helps me a lot!

As I mentioned, giving yourself a break will pause that stress, even for a bit. Getting creative is in my opinion the best way to give my brain some rest :)

PS. Stuttering is horrible. In addition to fast speaking it’s one of my main issues. I just kinda accepted it, if I need to get something across I take a deep breath to collect myself... but I think I might need to visit a logopedist... so that’s a thing I can’t really give an advice :P"
selfimprovement,fcebddz,t1_fcca8pw,1577618892.0,"Hey your welcome :)
So first of all: Baby steps. I had massive projects that felt like they would completely overwhelm my. But slowly and surely, with a plan in mind, I somehow managed to finish them.

Well, I guess those are two different question: 
“Are you doing the right thing”
to define the right thing for you I would say would be the right thing that resonates with your goals as a person. If the thing you are doing are fitting to the person you want to become, then logically saying, they are the right thing :)

Efficiency is a different story... learned it the hard way hahah
So to make the process the most efficient planning is crucial. How and when things have to be done is key to evaluate what something is worth. But... sometimes you can’t take everything into account, and being inefficient in the moment doesn’t mean that the whole process becomes inefficient. 
Let me give u a fitting metaphor... 
if you are fishing with a net, that has a whole or two in it, you are losing a few fish. But you are still doing way better than you would do with a fishing pole.

Keep doing your thing man. Great mindset and I hope I helped you a bit :) and I wish you only the best for the future!"
selfimprovement,fce8veq,t1_fcck9q5,1577618049.0,"I’m sure she’s not just a rebound. She managed to give you the feeling that she is important to you. It’s really hard to give you yourself that feeling, so I thing the bond you have is genuine. 

Well spending New Year’s Eve alone too, I learned for myself that there are two approaches:

Buy yourself the best snacks and the best food you can, get yourself a great streamer/great series/ great tv livestream, and enjoy it by yourself! Write the people u want the best wishes and then put the phone down for an hour or so.

The second approach would be just going out to a pub or bar. Order something and enjoy it with a bunch of random people! In less than a few minutes they won’t be so random anymore and you will find new contacts. Btw drink safely, sometimes less is more :P

But well, nonetheless, I wish your relation the best and a great New Year’s Eve and a better year 2020 :)"
selfimprovement,fce6a4r,t1_fce07lm,1577617311.0,"Alright, alright... so that means there are a lot different possibilities to meet new people. I felt alone for a major part of my life. And I never though that that would change. But by dumb accident I met a guy with a couple other friends, and now I trust these guys more than anyone else. And all of that by stupid accident. Well... what I’m trying to say... you will meet new people. Maybe open a bit to meeting new people in your environment. Just give it a chance :)

Till the feeling goes away or you meet somebody else... focus a bit more on yourself. Try a different music taste, maybe invest a bit more time in a hobby you couldn’t before. Or maybe just give yourself a break, start watching a series and forget for a moment.

If you feel lonely, just know, that there are others out there willing to listen. I hope that does count at least a bit for you :)"
selfimprovement,fce3ecv,t1_fccmisa,1577616517.0,"That you want to die is a state that isn’t great but, please, with all my heart, don’t let it come further than that. Stay strong, I know you managed to get here, so keep on pushing forward :)

Now, I know exactly that isn’t the right approach, but it’s important to understand the meaning right: so I met his girl a two years ago. She was genuinely an angel. But I didn’t work out. We met a couple weeks. But till today I’m not over it. Sometimes I wish I did better, but there actually isn’t really much I could have done differently. But I still can’t get over it... I know weird, but you know... happens 

I guess you don’t really hate yourself as a human being, but I think it’s more the state of who you are and how you are doesn’t really fit with how and who you -would like to be-
And that is perfectly fine, believe me, cause you can actually really change that :)
Maybe think for urself what you would like to do differently, make a list, and baby step by baby steps approach the goals on the list. 
Cause if you actually are how u want to be, why hate yourself? It’s a process that I learned over the years. I started going to the gym, learned how to change certain behaviour I expressed... and even though I’m not done yet, the feeling actually is quite weak by now"
selfimprovement,fce0zqq,t1_fccoy7z,1577615844.0,"Well, good thing is that emotions often have a meaning behind them haha.
So, as I think your Mom has changed in those 7 years, you grew as a person too! That means, that you two might have grown in completely different directions, so I think you should get that into account and give the whole process time. So you regret it and can’t change it... I think that that should be the most meaningful confirmation that you don’t want it to happen again? So don’t let it happen again! Focus on the future, with the faults of the past in mind, and slowly forge the bond between your mother you want!
(Reflecting on the past might hurt, but may be crucial :/ )
But heads up! Being scared of such a thing is normal, but don’t let the fear guide you. Rather use it as a tool to determine when you have to think sharper. It’s an advise I heard in the SAS special force. When they feel fear, they welcome it, to understand the situation and act accordingly.

Oh and one more thing! Sometimes it helps a bit to let ones thoughts cool off. Listen to some new music or start with a new series. I can recommend Einaudi, great classic music.
Or start with the Witcher. Great series :)"
selfimprovement,fcdy9uh,t1_fcd0x5v,1577615065.0,"Hm...  so, I guess, hi there internet stranger!
I don’t really know the situation you are in, but maybe that is a great opportunity to use it as a jump pad to get into a new friendship with someone else!
I would really like to say something, but it’s really hard to not step on a mine if you don’t know if it’s there, if you get the metaphor (I know it’s awful but the best I could come up with)
How did u two get in touch? Through education, a hobby, introduced by others?"
selfimprovement,fcdwtr8,t1_fcdmga4,1577614668.0,"It’s a feeling you have. I can tell you, even without knowing you, that this feeling is not a fact. The fact is, that you are doing actually ok I think. I failed often in my life. And I fucked up big time too. 
So, a few advices I was lucky enough to learn in my life:

Get some kind of job. If you are not in need of the money, it may be some kind of voluntary work. Especially homeless people and animal shelters are having a tough time around winter. 
Or just make a hobby ur job. For that I would recommend something you produce a product. Make a time schedule and create that thing, in my case music, regularly and you will find satisfaction in that process too.

If the feeling is more like a void, that doesn’t really allow the good things to stand out, create a list. A list with the good deeds you did to make the world a bit better. Picked up trash to throw it away, smiled to a stranger that seemed down, or maybe share a small meal with somebody who needs it. 
My advice, aim for three good deeds a day, and write them down.
U will quickly notice, that you are not a living failure. You are a great human being with massive potential to change the world around you for the better. 

I had these thoughts too. And these things helped. I hope, they will help you, too :)"
selfimprovement,fcdtm2l,t1_fcc0ux0,1577613665.0,"So, I had this thing with wolverine as a kid: 
I always thought that it he was the most badass character there is. That he was always this white knight under a black armour, not appreciated, and only living by his own credo. And that credo was enough to change his whole life and the life’s of others.
So, when Logan hit the cinemas, I was kinda scared to go watch it. Cause I knew, that with that film, a whole chapter of the movies, but also my childhood will be finished. 
It was a great movie. And one that really got to me on a different level."
selfimprovement,fcdsxh2,t1_fcc2l2g,1577613409.0,"Hey, heads up! Ur doing great. That’s a fact. Two years of commitment is a feat on its own. People will always doubt the things you say.
If I may give you the advice: Just let them talk, give em a nod and brush the topic off the table. Even if you don’t agree with them. 
Makes a lot of stuff easier :)"

So u straight got a new job, huge congratulations to you! I actually needed more than a couple weeks to start looking for a new one, so from my point of view you actually did amazing :)"
selfimprovement,fcbfxnd,t1_fcbe8mi,1577586376.0,"Well, what I did when I lost my job was waste a couple month doing nothing. I would advice that u should get any kind of job, even if it isn’t what u are looking for right now. Some job is better than none :P

Depression is rough man. I don’t know if u got urself some meds, or if u are fighting it by yourself. But whatever you are doing, don’t stop with it. Keep ur head up, and be proud how long u endured the pain! I truly believe, that you are gonna win the fight.

Loneliness is a difficult topic. I think it really depends on ur personality. But I would advice u to try two things:
Force urself to go out, and do something with people: cooperate with a charity, look up projects for homeless, and try to socialise a bit. 
But on the other hand, try to find something in that moment of peace to enjoy, be it producing music, making some art or maybe just enjoying things. For example I discovered classic music is a thing for me! Haven’t given it a though for at least 20 years tho!"
