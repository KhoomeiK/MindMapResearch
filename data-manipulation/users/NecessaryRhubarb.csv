personalfinance,feecsq0,t1_feeaccb,1579031099.0,"I save 40% of my income for retirement. I also spend close to $10,000 a year going out to dinner. The math here is two fold, spending down, and income up.  You have to learn to live at one level, and earn at another.

I am pushing for a $15,000 raise this year, and guess what that will mean? $15,000 more towards mortgage and retirement, not spending a penny more. I will get to my goals faster, while living at the level I am comfortable at.

I buy private label at the grocery store, look for deals whenever possible, maintain a wish list and shop based on sales, and spend an extremely high amount on travel and dining compared to the average american. I spend a crazy amount on cooking as well, but for the ingredients I value.

The best advice I would give everyone is to spend at a level where every dollar brings you happiness, or is a necessity.  I recently cut $3.99 from my monthly spend, and I reduced a bit of stress, because it was no longer bringing me happiness.

I think step one is to trim your budget so lean that only necessities (and things that will cost money to cancel and you might actually want) are left. Then slowly add items and analyze each one to see if it is bringing any value to you.  It really is a great scientific test to say ""I added Netflix to my monthly budget, did it add value at the price I paid?"" If so, keep it.  If not, ditch it. Once that is set, you realize what you enjoy, what your hobbies are, and how much you can spend on them. Don't feel bad if you love a manicure, or a massage, or buying bourbon, as long as the benefit is there for you. If you don't like spending $50 on a manicure, stop doing it!"

I like that the drink gets more complex and different flavors as you move from bourbon heavy with orange to sweeter finish the more the ice melts and the sugar water mixes. I don’t like simple syrup because of this, it doesn’t seem to change the flavor profile as the drink continues.

I also tried mixing and then pouring over ice, and that reduced the complexity as well.  I think I am going to try shaking the bourbon and straining it over the cube and not mixing it at all, so far the last sip is perfect but the first one is too bourbon heavy."
