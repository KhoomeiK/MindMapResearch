Again, let's use the original analogy.

I move into your house and start finding justification to start killing you. (Your estimates are soft considering pre-columbus estimates of the native Americans were over 3 million.) 

This wouldn't have happened if settlers hadn't been invading their lands."

White colonialists committed genocide, ""well, they were all warring savages so their genocide was justified"" 

That's about as white supremacist as it gets.

This whole response is filled with inaccuracies. To blatantly say that colonists were docile ""rich"" while the natives were more prone to violence is an insult. This isn't accurate at all. 

Should we just pretend the trail of tears never happened, and it was the natives fault for being on the colonists land before they got there?

Should we ignore the genocide that happened as a result of colonial advancement across the entire US?"

Finally, imagine I move into your house and start bringing in my family slowly taking over the entire house, and then start moving you from room to a closet, and then finally into the crawl space. 

Then I say, this is my house now and you can either choose to be a member or leave. Your response is simply, ""if those are my choices can I at least have my own sovereign space in here?"" We agree to that, but I then spend 20 years marginalizing you, and my grandchildren refer to you as the lazy person who takes up space in OUR house but refuses to play by our rules.
