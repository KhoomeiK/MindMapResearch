Had an issue with my bike, relatively similar where I would get 10l / 100km, hiccups on the low rpms and sometimes weird misfires.

Mechanic says everything is fine.  


Then an error code pops up : 3.2 pressure sensor fault.

Because of that, the ECU was in a degraded mode and was running too rich, hence the hiccups and high fuel usage.

30% is done in the kitchen (I mean the kitchen, not deliveroo).

The other 50% are the commitment you need to make.

Start by getting your nutrition in check, count your calories for 2 weeks (honestly counting), reduce them by 20% while going for walks and doing some light cardio if you can.  


If you really want to lift, I'd be happy to help you find a program but your focus should not be on that part, that will come next !  :)"

You say you wanna loose your gut but not get buff. Why the hell would you have calf raises in here, then ? :) Calf is something you isolate when your legs already are pretty built.
