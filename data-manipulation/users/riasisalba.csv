I[F] wanted to play with my bf’s butthole which he was extremely against. It had to do with social stigma and that if his friends found out it’d probably be like “bro that’s gay” kind of reaction.

So I started with sucking his dick, then to his balls. Then progressed to the perineum (between balls and asshole). And then eventually licked his butthole. I did this over a course of a month and progressed one inch closer every time. I made sure he still liked it as I progressed. Now I eat his ass.

A lot of people want to be angry at the hospital staff but it really can’t be blamed on them. The problem is the medical system. She was already diagnosed with an enlarged heart a year ago and should have had regular doctor visits but probably pushed it off because of lack of insurance (maybe maybe not). The reason why wait time is so long is because the EMTALA says that everyone that checks in insurance or not have to be examined. So people who do not have insurance go to ER for non emergencies and clog up the system.
