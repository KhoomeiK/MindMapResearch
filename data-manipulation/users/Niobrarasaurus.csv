Thanks for all the eye tips!"
Needlefelting,fe6o7qc,t1_fe6nzv5,1578897862.0,"Do the safety eyes stay in very well? It seems like if you had to snip a hole, then they wouldn’t fit very tightly into the wool. Did you glue them?

The cheap stuffed animal trick is smart! I wouldn’t have thought of that, but it certainly would work lol"
Needlefelting,fe6njbl,t1_fe6n0nx,1578897099.0,"Cool, thanks! I might try this method sometime."
Needlefelting,fe6mpl8,t3_enxwg2,1578896201.0,"How do you get the eyes to stay? It seems to me like they would fall out without some sort of support. 

Also, super cute!"
AmItheAsshole,fe68zjv,t1_fe67ku7,1578884418.0,I agree. Definitely talk to your neighbor first before you complain to anyone higher up.
AskReddit,fe686te,t3_enxxwn,1578883918.0,If you get impaled by something don’t take it out! You’ll bleed much heavier and you’re likely to cause additional damage trying to remove it.
Paleontology,fe62rlc,t3_entvst,1578880482.0,"As a paleontologist (in training): yes! We do get annoyed when people call us archeologists.

Most of the time it’s kids who mix it up, so I just tell them what the difference is. I don’t think I’ve ever seen the media get it wrong!"
Dinosaurs,fe3m4jm,t3_enpkl0,1578850579.0,"Huh, I’ve never heard of the shell-crusher mosasaur. I guess I need to do some Wikipedia-ing. This display is very cool! Everything looks very well-preserved."
TheMagnusArchives,fds55oc,t3_emxqq5,1578694587.0,I really like how you drew the extra eyes. I don’t know if I’ve seen that design/placement before.
college,fdp3jy3,t3_emjerr,1578619162.0,"It’s totally possible! I’m majoring in Spanish and Geology, which are two completely separate things, and my schedule still fits into four years. Every college is different, but gen eds should be the same for both majors, meaning adding another major just makes you have to add the core classes for that major, not extra gen eds. Just make sure you plan ahead, because major-specific classes can sometimes conflict with each other."
college,fdoyn12,t3_emcq4e,1578615872.0,"Ours are a little skittish around people, but last year I was able to feed one of them that was pregnant some peanuts pretty close up! The babies will sometimes let you pet them if they are young enough. They don’t eat out of the trash cans very often cause that’s the raccoons’ territory."
college,fdo76el,t3_embdf6,1578600074.0,"Just put it very frankly. Don’t sugar coat it, and keep it short. Try not to say anything that she could take to the RA and get you in trouble for. 
In my experience, it’s best to phrase things like “I need...” and “I feel...”. 
If all else fails, maybe you could find a new suite?"
Needlefelting,fdlncup,t3_elzhw6,1578527943.0,Omg I didn’t notice his tiny little feet/toes at first! Super cute. How did you get the thread to stay and not fall out?
