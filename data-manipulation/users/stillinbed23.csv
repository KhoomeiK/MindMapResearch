AskDocs,fg1ipw4,t1_fg11mjy,1580427831.0,"No no! I’m so sorry I was joking. Our healthcare is a mess. I was agreeing in a facetious way. I hope you didn’t feel bad. What we pay for healthcare is criminal. I spoke to the doctor again and my insurance company. The drug won’t be covered by my insurance but the office visit will be. So it’s a partial win. I’ll get the drug at least.
We have elections happening again soon and hopefully we can change leadership. It’s a scary situation."
AskDocs,fg11e6b,t1_fg0z3l1,1580418998.0,Yes. I’m in the US. Land of the weird and sad. Thanks for your help this far.
AskDocs,fg0yvuy,t1_fg0muxt,1580417728.0,Omg they called me back again and tried to tell me the fda won’t allow them to prescribe it for me. I googled off label prescribing and it says it’s legal and common. They keep trying to get me to go to the office for my appointment to talk about the financial info which I keep refusing. The fda can’t refuse me this iron as far as I know. My insurance company can tell me they won’t cover it possibly but that’s another story. Do you understand what they’re trying to do? The last person I spoke with told me they had to ask their manager about me cash paying for the iron as if cash paying is something odd. I’ve never had this much trouble with a doctors office.
AskDocs,fg0mqs8,t1_fg0d8dw,1580410908.0,They called me back and said that it’s fine I can have Venofer. They just have to run it by my insurance. Wow. I called 4 times last week and just got the run around. Maybe it was just miscommunication?  The nurse I spoke with seemed much nicer than anyone I’d spoken to on other occasions and seemed to know what I was talking about. It’s a big place so maybe it was miscommunication? Idk but I’m happy. Thanks for the push to communicate again.
ehlersdanlos,fg0h5x6,t3_ew860x,1580407707.0,Yay! Where are you going?
AskDocs,fg0d4u6,t1_fg0c6bl,1580405287.0,Okay so I called and left a message asking if she’d be able to prescribe it off label and if not could she please explain why. So she might be sick of me at this point but oh well. I’ll post what answer she gives me. Thanks for your help.
AskDocs,fg0cjym,t1_fg0c6bl,1580404936.0,Okay I’ll ask again. This medication has no lawsuits which is why I want it. It’s the safest. This doc has a very odd bedside manner and I’m not comfortable with her at all. I’ll have to leave a message for her as she’s a hemotologist/ oncologist and very busy.
AskDocs,fg0c64c,t1_fg0btxw,1580404707.0,They didn’t say they couldn’t get it. They said they wouldn’t prescribe it because of the fda. Which is bizarre I think.
AskDocs,fg0bzgt,t1_fg0bo7m,1580404595.0,I asked for it and they said they could switch me from feraheme to infed. So it’s not what I asked for. I asked the insurance coordinator and she told me they couldn’t do it as the fda prohibited them from prescribing it to me. I’ve had some trouble with this office and I’m nervous about communicating with them now. I have no way to communicate directly with the doc. Should I just call back again and ask for it again? I’m worried they think I’m a pain at this point.

Maybe if you really push that aspect your doc will give you infusions again? Also did you ever have a reaction to infusions? And what type iron did they give you?

blunderyears,ffvgyug,t1_ffv7kxw,1580263880.0,Mine was 1992 in my middle school hallway. I immediately thought it was disgusting and was like nope not for me. Took me a couple more years to change my mind.
alcoholicsanonymous,ffvgn6d,t3_evfbx7,1580263664.0,Technically I believe it’s an outside issue. For me personally It’d be a relapse. I smoked pot when I first stopped drinking for about a month in aa. I actually gave back my 30 day chip and then took it again with my new date after I had stopped both. For me I know that if I’m high all the time I won’t have the presence of mind to stay away from a drink.
alcoholicsanonymous,ffvgb3c,t3_evfdt5,1580263443.0,So normal and temporary. Your brain will chill at some point. Keep taking all the suggestions and work the steps and eventually your body and mind will shift. I’ve found reading the stories in the back to be relaxing. Also eating or drinking something sweet helps me now and I’m not new anymore. It rare though now and for me due to health stuff.
AmItheAsshole,ffvg3f5,t3_evabsr,1580263302.0,When they’re big it’s different. My 18 year old started screaming at me in the car one day when he was home on break. It scared my younger two kids. It dawned on me that I didn’t need to tolerate this. I slowed down and told him to get out of the car. Told him he can’t do that with me and that he’s big and it’s scary. He was shocked and got out and I drove home without him. Just to clarify it was 9pm at night and next to a park with a sidewalk. Not dangerous at all. He called a friend and went to eat. Later when he came home he apologized. He hasn’t tried it again.

GERD,ffovynw,t1_fforfmi,1580082474.0,"I have sibo and ibs as well. I have several methods I use to try to speed food through my digestive track. I use sugar, coffee, physical exercise, and liquid vit b 12 to try to accelerate food through my system. I can’t tolerate the coffee long term so I cycle it on and off. Sugar works great but I’m scared of what eating too much is doing to me so I try to use that sparingly. Core exercises literally push food through. I’m not sure why but this liquid b12 makes my stomach empty. I think it annoys my stomach so it dumps. If my stomach gets upset from any of these I use protonix, a prescription ppi. It’s a not perfect balance. I have other health issues that interfere too. Meh. Physical exercise is the best one though that has no side effects.
