Jeep,ff9bx09,t1_ff81oke,1579709455.0,TF is widgets.wp.com?   That’s all I can see.
PublicFreakout,fekoyx0,t1_fekhoim,1579204599.0,"You want to know the scary thing.  The national security investigations for the United States of America have been turned over to private for profit companies since the 90’s.  They are now beholden to shareholders just like every other corporation out there.  Look up USIS, Keypoint Government Solutions, CACI...The list goes on.  Not ONE of these companies cares about anything more than satisfying their shareholders.  

The entire lot of them should be turned out and sold to the lowest bidder."
cats,fehtpk3,t3_ep7cq5,1579123673.0,So sorry.  Very Sad to hear!
COMPLETEANARCHY,fehm8gm,t3_ep5q1j,1579119396.0,"I assume since the average net worth of the average American is in parenthesis, they mean for that number to be negative.   Sounds about right!"
cats,fegvtmv,t3_ep0uzv,1579103667.0,So sorry.  We just went through losing one of ours on the 4th.   Take your time with it.

cats,fdkh5uv,t1_fdejz5x,1578503782.0,It is crushing.  Thank You for the thought.

Jeep,fdirihj,t1_fdir90t,1578449421.0,Nothing really works.  I take them completely off and realign them perfectly and they stay good for about two days.   My only other solution would be a new top someday.   For now I’m good.  I love my Jeep so I’ll take her flaws.
Jeep,fdijs73,t3_eliyae,1578444483.0,Nice!   I have the exact same baby as you.   Same color and everything.   Looks like you have the same issue with the back window panels velcro.    Gotta love the Jeep!
