ADHD,ffkm1jt,t1_ffjlutq,1580024989.0," I used to pick up my bf's phone and answer with ""dave's phone, his partner here. He's just busy at the moment can I take a message?"" Usually when he was taking a nap or shower or even just sitting across from me but not in the headspace to take a call.  Sometimes I'd be able to handle the whole thing sometimes just get a name/number to call back. Less intimidating than a bunch of missed calls. Sometimes just saying out loud "" Theresa from Agency, about setting an appointment"" he'd listen and nod if he wanted to take the call and I'd say ""oh he's just come in the door. Theresa is on the line about blah blah. And hand him the phone, or just relay the message they wanted to give him. Basically treating it more like a landline that they'd reached rather than his personal phone, if you are comfortable with her answering some calls on your behalf. Otherwise you could set up a joint voip number or forward your calls to your partners phone after a certain number of rings so she can act as a message-taking service maybe?

If you don't play the role you've been cast or you undermine the role they have cast for themselves (hero, master, friend, lover, protector, doting father/mother/husband/wife, victim, martyr, successful businessperson, intellectual etc) you must be forced back into your role immediately.

As far as bullying goes, chidren and teenagers are remarkably astute at picking up what their peers are insecure about and can be merciless in that regard. It's less about the thing and more about the fact that you are  insecure, kids get bullied for all kind of reasons that have nothing to do with reality.

As far as male attention, teenage boys are not renowned for their exquisite tastes - your low self esteem and covering up probably had more to do with it than anything else. If you weren't a popular kid you wouldn't be on their radar anyway, unless you were one of the girls     trading blowjobs for affection in the school toilets. Again, awkward, low self esteem girls will be bullied and bullies go for where it hurts, otherwise it wouldn't be effective. I'm sure that you were no uglier than many of your peers.

How do we decide who is indiginous enough to take advantage of the arrangement, and if it's self designated how do we stop non-indiginous taking advantage of the system?

todayilearned,fdqiwlu,t1_fdq1a00,1578667782.0,"I'd be worried about any kind of obsessive behaviour, regardless of genre. Some kids get really into their favourite thing and/or the community regarding that thing, and parents need to step in if the child is focussing on on it to the extent that it becomes unhealthy, whether it be k-pop, instagram, horror movies or videogames. Some fan communities surrounding certain media can be toxic in their own right as well, that's another thing parents should be aware of. Like you say, talking to them like a human being to see where their head is at can help you figure out where to draw the line between encouraging an interest and keeping them from getting sucked into a negative spiral"
LifeProTips,fdq7kjb,t3_eaalpy,1578658213.0,"A lot of people use the word rude to mean ""anything I dont like or understand, or assume to be meant to be an insult"" 

Its more likely that Uncle Jim just doesn't have great social skills and has undiagnosed PTSD, than him trying specifically to offend you Aunt Karen.

It doesn't mean that you let people be insulting, mean or pushy  with you, because some people cross the line and you don't need to hang around people that raise your stress levels.

But people really need to chill on pretending like there's a universal rulebook that everybody ascribes to for social situations and that any deviation is clearly DiSrEsPeCt and not just a difference in principles.

An example I saw recently was someone bitching that their sister in law didn't bring wine to a dinner party, clearly she was cheap and unappreciative. The first thing I thought of was that if you aren't a wine drinker, or your friends generally don't drink wine, or you don't often go to dinner parties, or you are currently struggling financially, or you just plain forgot, or your family is pretty casual.... There's a hundred reasonable reasons to not bring wine with you to dinner at your brother's house that aren't ""I want to piss off my sister in law and leave a bad impression"" .

I generally think the concept of ""rudeness"" is outdated. Social convention for social convention's sake makes life needlessly hard for everyone -  but especially people who  have other shit going on in their life that's more pressing than offending the family prudes. Some people also can't tell the difference between being  assertive and being rude, so anyone who shows an ounce of backbone is an asshole, but act like a doormat to genuine assholes. Some people can be perfectly within the bounds of social convention and yet utlise social norms to bully others ruthlessly. Of course the reverse is true as well, and many social norms are in place for a reason.

Always ask yourself ""am I upset because I have been treated badly, or am I upset that this person acted differently than I wanted them to?"" And ""am I upset because I am ascribing the most upsetting reasons for their behaviour instead of any number of more reasonable reasons?"" And finally ""even if I am upset for a reason that is justified, am I responding to it in a way that makes sense or am I reacting in a way that makes the situation worse and not better?""

Just my 2c"

Worse for me personally though was guy-friends  (not great friends in hindsight) who, knowing I was bi,  tried to facilitate their bi-curious friends hooking up with me, like I could be pimped out for the authentic ""lesbian experience"" to college girls on demand. Just because you want to sleep with her doesn't mean I want to, I'm not really into frat girls my dude. You aren't really doing me a favour by trying to play matchmaker. It was never; here's a nice girl who would appreciate going on a date, you have a lot of common  interests, it was always ""we were talking about experimenting sexually and agreed you would be acceptable"".  

I think it comes from men and women generally having different approaches to dating and sex, even gay ones. A young guy might be pretty chuffed to get a msg from a drinking buddy saying there was a hot single looking for nsa sex tonight. Girls  might be on the lookout for a ""good man"" for their friend who laments the lack of good men in their life.

You are 28, there's no better time in your life to experience living overseas, marry a beautiful bride and start a new life, you can always move back later.

in a 5 gal there's only 2 things you need to know really as a newbie

1) buy ""water conditioner"" from the pet store and add it to your tap water before putting it in your tank. Use tap water don't  use bottled water or any kind of special water. Just follow the instructions on the label. Water conditioner makes it safe for your fish

 2) set your heater to  a temp suitable for tropical fish, about 26 or 27 degrees Celsius but check using Google for the temp in Fahrenheit if that's what you use. 

For a single small fish in 5 gal you can do fish-in cycling which means you don't need to be too worried about leaving it empty for weeks, if you are worried you can buy ""starter microbes"" in a bottle to speed it along. You can buy the things you need at the pet store.

Try and keep your blood sugar stable. If  it bounces around it affects your mood and triggers a binge, so keep snacks handy, something that isn't too sugary but will give you some energy. When you binge it's usually because your brain (which runs on glucose - a sugar) has run out of glucose, because you are either in a post-binge sugar crash ( binging triggers insulin which takes all the energy in what you just ate and moves it out of your blood and into your body's cells, so it's no longer available to your brain, so you get fatter but your brain is still starving) or you waited too long after your last meal and missed the subtle signs of impending glucose-depletion and instead are getting emotionally volatile or beginning to think about binging/drug use because your brain is running out of fuel and it doesn't understand that this is actually a fuel/hydration issue, and binging and drugs both feel like they are fixing the problem but in the long run just make things worse. 

If you can get your blood sugar to stabilize your therapy will go much smoother, your cravings will begin to be less intense and your ability to manage your emotional landscape will improve significantly (not to mention insulin spikes can lead to diabetes over the longer term). It's not that it will be 100% smooth sailing, but it will no longer feel impossible. Counterintuitvely this will mean eating more frequently, every 2 or 3 hours, and drinking a decent glass of water every time as well. 

Your brain is basically starving at times because of the insulin crash cycle that binging causes and the only way to break the cycle is to plan so you never hit the red zone ( either too high or too low), brain fuel wise. If it helps set  timers to go off to remind you to eat something, and don't miss meals or put off eating because if you hit that sugar  red zone your brain is basically grasping for anything it can get to run off, and suddenly you will be neck deep in timtams and pizza or whetever your drug of choice is.

Get your sugar stable, keep seeing your therapist and make little changes over time to get healthy. You may find your therapist recommends medication  to help stabilize your moods, the right medication can do wonders as well, and if you don't already take a multivitamin you can get them in gummy form which makes them a lot more pleasant to take!
