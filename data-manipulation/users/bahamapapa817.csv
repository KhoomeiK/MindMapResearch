BlackPeopleTwitter,fgt97gl,t3_f0b4t3,1581101163.0,Most dudes just had the people in your neighborhood. Dudes nowadays have access to hundreds of women due to the Internet. The need for chivalry is very low. Back then you had to have game cause pickings were slim. Supply and demand

cowboys,fgssmns,t1_fgsk1if,1581091801.0,To be fair Marinelli’s defense calls for balls to the walls play every single down. You have to have a rotation because it’s not sustainable all game. I would rather they be on the field a lot more giving 90% like the JJ Watts and Calais Campbell’s do. Some plays they rush to sack and some they rush to tackle the runner and some they rush to contain the QB and bat down passes.

cowboys,fgr5fny,t1_fgnzrot,1581038604.0,Even if we keep Amari and have Gallup I would not be upset if we drafted one in the second round. This class is deep at WR. We can possibly get a Gallup level receiver in the 3rd round. I think safety and DT are our top 2 needs. If we have a choice I say get a safety in round one. I’m fact i would draft 2 safeties with our 7 picks. Dak-Amari-Jones-Quinn are must keeps. I would like to have Lee back. Have McGovern and Williams battle for LG. I liked what I saw out of Malcolm Smith.

InstacartShoppers,fgpsl5l,t3_eztl3e,1581011190.0,Either Instacart is clueless about how much food gigs pay or they know and just don’t care. Either way it’s a bad look on their part. On DD I picked up two bowls of soup at Schlotzsky’s for $7 and the house was 1.3 miles away. I’ve seen 35-40 items with 50-60 units for $7 and no tip REGULARLY. I’m not a fast shopper that’s a minimum of an hour of work from the time I get the ping the drive to store the shopping selecting good products checking out and driving to customer.

cowboys,fgg49m9,t3_ey9k6j,1580753927.0,They have a ton of new rules you would have to look it up. Pretty exciting ones. The overtime rules are legit. Like a shootout in hockey. Alternate one play and whoever wins best out of five wins the game. Things like that

cowboys,fgfpynl,t1_fgfpoaj,1580744973.0,I think this one was a fluke. They really needed an offensive lineman and had a surplus of DBs. Then that OL guy got hurt. Really can’t predict that but it did sting a little

InstacartShoppers,ffte9rv,t3_eut2sx,1580218003.0,This is the tool they used to lower pay significantly. They figure if you take 42 seconds per item and it’s 33 items then it should take you 23 minutes to shop that add 10-12 minutes to deliver and they pay $7. Their reasoning is if you do two of these an hour you average $15/hr before tips. A lot of people don’t shop this fast they just take pics of the items and get them all then scan so their time is ridiculously low. It ended up screwing us because I like to be number one as well but this sucks. They then get to say we can’t help it if this guy is slower than average. Speed up and get paid more by doing more batches
doordash,fft98u1,t1_ffs85fc,1580213070.0,I came to say this. Besides from the obvious people who cannot get out and shop. If you can’t tip you shouldn’t be using this luxury service and then sheepishly saying “Aw shucks all I have is 72 cents i found on the floor before you got here”
InstacartShoppers,ffs5h09,t3_euv9oo,1580173617.0,I would put good money that programmers were instructed to leave it off and make shopper call in and request it. Funny how they never screw up and overpay you’re. EVER!! But they always “mess up” and underpay you and make you have to fight for your coins

cowboys,ffp5v9t,t3_eue3oz,1580087015.0,I was at the pro bowl and that’s when the news broke. My phone was going off and people were saying it out loud in the stands.

AmazonFlexDrivers,ffi2x7p,t1_ffi2o89,1579963521.0,On the terms and conditions it says it’s not allowed and from time to time they will deactivate people. But I think they just want packages delivered. I think it’s a tool they have in case they need to cut the number of drivers that’s an easy way. That’s just my opinion
AmazonFlexDrivers,ffi1esk,t1_ffi18jw,1579962185.0,I know one of them is called flexomatic and it’s an app that grabs blocks for you so you do to have to tap all day. There is another one but I don’t know the name of it. Both are only on Android. iPhone does not have an app like that as of yet. It’s still being worked on
AmazonFlexDrivers,ffh12c5,t3_etkejl,1579920263.0,Because if you don’t accept them where I am then you will never work for amazon flex. Congratulations. Blocks just sit on your app in your area. That doesn’t happen everywhere. We are so happy for you. But to answer your question that is why drivers accept $18/hr blocks. There is also this app for Android people that auto accepts blocks for people. If you don’t have this app then you have a tough time working. When everything is equal then come talk to me. Posts like these are ignorant.
