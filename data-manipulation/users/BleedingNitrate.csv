cosplay,fgxxlil,t3_f0q78a,1581177547.0,I thought this was an HD mod/art or something! That's excellent!
Legitpiercing,fgxxfss,t1_fgxm9o3,1581177491.0,"Aw man! That sucks, I hope everything goes OK when the backs are removed. That happened to me too and I had to use tweezers to remove it :/

I wonder why it swelled so much though?"
HoodedEyes,fgh7qhe,t3_ey6pk3,1580778657.0,Your eye color is so cool!

oddlyweird,fg6lt25,t3_ex2dg7,1580571321.0,The [Jacob Sheep ](https://i.redd.it/kx74cbsiopc11.jpg) has pretty interesting horns also.
aww,fg2s56s,t1_fg2pkle,1580453661.0,I also thought it was weird vomit lol. Glad to hear I'm not the only one who saw it.
RATS,ffvyold,t1_ffvp25g,1580277451.0,Yw! Yeah they know how to make stuff look good. It's a talent for sure

ADHD,ffv21mf,t1_ffuwlr6,1580253877.0,"I do take it in the morning. I'm pretty against sleep pills but it's a valid suggestion. I'll ask him about the lower dose, thank you"
ADHD,ffunyrb,t1_ffumaca,1580245949.0,"30 MG, a couple days. 

I know it's not long at all, I just am frustrated because I can't deal with getting 3 hrs of sleep every night and constantly being so tired."
ADHD,ffu5tv6,t1_ffu5jbv,1580235117.0,I asked to try a different med since Vyvanse had a couple side effects like being super tense that kinda sucked. But I really hate the side effects of Strattera more/theyre effecting my school so...
PiratePets,ffsuswo,t1_ffs4f9m,1580193309.0,"Since you mention a surgery there, I hope it all goes well! He is very cute."

RATS,ffmoe7j,t1_ffmbzpv,1580057278.0,"The issue is essentially that my computer chair is too low and my desk is too high. If I put my arms on the armrests, my elbows are pretty low and this causes wrist strain. I can't get a new desk or a new chair, so I will have to work it out somehow."
aww,ffkelw3,t1_ffk11or,1580021495.0,After the video game character or for another reason?

RATS,ffistyd,t1_ffis4yh,1579981844.0,"I actually found it by specifically looking for one that's not a butt, lmao. I wanted a cute mousepad with a wrist thing but not those. 

I agree!"
RATS,ffiqqaa,t1_ffiq8fy,1579980348.0,"I'm not sure, but I hope it can make somebody happy! It seems to have high reviews."

EatCheapAndHealthy,ffihcya,t1_ffhamc6,1579973899.0,Those sound great. I didn't think of cashews/less crunchy types. Thank you
AmItheAsshole,ffih96d,t1_ffhmdwp,1579973829.0,Best of luck! I hope everything works out okay.
disneyvacation,ffhjl8g,t1_ffh3wwd,1579938215.0,MY SON HAS BEEN DOWNLOADING NIPPLES AND I NEED TO DO MY TAXES!
ihadastroke,ffhjb98,t3_etinst,1579937837.0,This is what I come here for. To wonder what the fuck people were trying to say.
EatCheapAndHealthy,ffh4ft5,t1_ffh3ohe,1579922841.0,"Those ideas are very good, thank you!"
AmItheAsshole,ffgs4cg,t3_etj7el,1579913651.0,"YTA. People who announce they're leaving a chat/server are obnoxious as hell. Also, maybe nobody liked the thing you asked about so they didn't reply??"
AmItheAsshole,ffgo439,t3_etiq4u,1579910791.0,"YTA. People are allowed to not like somebody that you like. Telling the teacher didn't do anything besides make them dislike you. They won't suddenly change their ways, they just won't talk shit around you"
AmItheAsshole,ffgnpi4,t3_etimts,1579910507.0,"NTA. It seems that she's mad about being called out for not doing the right thing. Regardless of her situation, asking for a day's notice is really not unreasonable."
AmItheAsshole,ffgn81z,t3_etipwa,1579910171.0,"NTA. Telling coworkers about your family member passing away/other personal info is not okay. Sometimes with those situations you just want some people to treat you normally instead of being showered with pity, platitudes, etc. And why would they have to know anyway?

Not speaking to you for a week is childish as hell. Relationships are built on communication and clearly she's not mature enough to communicate with you.

Lastly, the mom thing is really weird also. It seems like she does not value your opinion or what you want."
AmItheAsshole,ffgmgbh,t3_etir7y,1579909646.0,NTA. Donating blood for any reason can help save somebody's life! Your motivation does not effect that.
AmItheAsshole,ffgm1mx,t1_ffgksmn,1579909370.0,Lol that would be the worst! Ty!
AmItheAsshole,ffglzjq,t1_ffgl8v1,1579909330.0,"lmao, ty. I'm inclined to agree that it was super weird"
AmItheAsshole,ffglyak,t1_ffgkmim,1579909307.0,"That makes sense, thanks for helping me understand why she behaved that way."
AmItheAsshole,ffglunq,t1_ffgl6xf,1579909239.0,Yeah I didn't really know either of them very well. That's why it was so confusing...I didn't really know what they wanted from me. Ty!
AmItheAsshole,ffglq5o,t1_ffgkuwl,1579909154.0,"Yeah, her responses made me wonder if I messed up because they were weirdly aggressive. Glad to hear I didn't. Ty!"
EatCheapAndHealthy,ffghhyn,t1_ffgeusj,1579906347.0,"Man, I wish. Hot cheetos are life lol."
EatCheapAndHealthy,ffgalz0,t1_ffga2ar,1579902042.0,"I suck at wrapping, but it is a great idea and I should try it out. Also applesauce is good. Ty"
EatCheapAndHealthy,ffgag3n,t1_ffg86r9,1579901941.0,"Idk why I didn't think of pasta salad, that's a great option ty"
EatCheapAndHealthy,ffg7s6h,t1_ffg7nqe,1579900299.0,"Good thinking, thank you."
EatCheapAndHealthy,ffcehch,t1_ffbynov,1579797719.0,"Seaweed may be better for people who dislike bitter tastes. Imo kale is horribly bitter and gross in all its forms, and I hear some people are just more sensitive to it.

But both are preference of course"
piercing,ff8dwjm,t3_es38pv,1579674412.0,They don't know what they're talking about. You look great!
ADHD,fezihr9,t3_eqs2j7,1579457700.0,"Yeah definitely. Especially when everyone lists like ""needs to think on their feet"" or ""organized"" and I can't really do either lol."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,feyycoy,t1_fexuka4,1579451980.0,I feel the same about the sense of humor part especially. Or conversation topics that not as many women are into.
GirlGamers,fewlzir,t3_eqn97j,1579414136.0,"It took me a minute to realize the mousepad is a butt, lmao"
EatCheapAndHealthy,fet8g9q,t3_eqj42e,1579372738.0,I just got one of those [vegetable dicer](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71GF76MQfFL._SX466_.jpg) things from goodwill and use that every time I need to chop stuff. I hate cooking but this makes it a lot easier.
reptiles,fepo0og,t3_eq89v2,1579325693.0,What did you line the inside with? Cause I imagine the wood would get all nasty after a while.
piercing,fen8s1m,t3_eq2f21,1579279456.0,"Damn, getting it done at 10g must have hurt really bad! Looks great tho!"
ADHD,fen5zlu,t3_epy0sa,1579277726.0,It baffles me how some people are able to finish so quickly tbh. I wish I could see what that's like for a day.
aww,feablyc,t1_fea8qem,1578946682.0,"My cavalier king Charles was the same way, but only with certain people. She also hated kids. It's weird how dogs can be a lot different then their breed usually is."
RATS,fe3ocp3,t1_fe3l98u,1578851281.0,I've never seen one but that makes so much sense.
awfuleverything,fdx6cs8,t3_en87oz,1578765755.0,Good thing he was in a truck! I imagine it would destroy a normal car.
piercing,fdx5yh4,t3_en994r,1578765617.0,"I think you're right, this doesn't look correct to me either. It looks like the back part is pressing into your ear also, but I can't see enough to say so. The angle looks weird to me too.

 However I am not a professional so I can't say for sure!"
funny,fde5bcc,t1_fde4kwi,1578331507.0,"Same. It's pretty damn awful tbh, can't wait to leave"
