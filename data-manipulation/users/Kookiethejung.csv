I try closing my eyes, listening to music, and buckling my seatbelt insanely tight. breathe deeply. If tears come out, fine. let them. Just try your hardest to think about other things.

dogs,fdo8rhs,t3_ema4gh,1578600851.0,If you go to Korea with your dog then you’d be shouting “Dad!” every time you called it. haha
dogs,fdl3d7g,t3_elwcmi,1578516363.0,"For crate training, try putting some treats on the floor, slowly coaxing her in. Then you could try putting her meals in there. Make sure the crate door is open at all times. also try covering the top of it with blankets, and stay by her side while she’s in the crate. Make sure that when she gets used to being in there, you slowly close the door, don’t lock it at first, and then when she’s comfortable with that, lock it. When she understands that she’s safe, she’ll probably only whine if she wants cuddles/playtime etc, but you should ignore her whines. Treat her a few seconds after she goes quiet and stops whining."
