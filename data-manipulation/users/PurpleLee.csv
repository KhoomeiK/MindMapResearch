I'm not going to try to explain it to you, cause it's like wondering why some heathens put ketchup on hot-dogs-- It's their preference. I'm not irrational about it, nor will I upset a gathering over it, however I will deal with it my way, and hope my friends understand.

Edit: Damn, downvoted for taking off my shoes and having understanding friends. Must be the friends part, reddit doesn't get the concept of friendship."

Just got off the subway, smartly dressed man walked up to me, and gave me his card. Told me, he was a recruiter for a modeling agency, and his agency was looking for young black women to do some shows around the city. I was to call him the following day to set up an interview.

I was freshly married, we'd just moved into our new home, also a f/t student and p/t employed-- I had zero time for such things. About 2 weeks later, the local news ran a story about fake modeling recruiters. Two women had escaped from a building they went to for modeling gigs.
