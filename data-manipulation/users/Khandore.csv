Even if they had a car they would still be forced to use time management, though. Having them walk isn't a better way to teach that. I mean, in the sense that they may take their time, or hurry up, depending on how long it's gonna take. I can see in that way. Unless you leave their entire morning up to themselves to get to school, walking or not. That definitely would teach time management. And I believe should be encouraged.

I prefer to get a ride to work, instead of walking. I don't own a vehicle. But I can usually get a ride. But I also walk home 95% of the time.

Like, choosing to drive or get a ride is not a moral crisis. With all of the drivers in my area, our air pollution is still below average. Me getting a ride to work is not going to upset that fine balance. And if there was a huge push to stop using cars, I'd stop. That's obvious. But I'm not going to make my life any harder, not for any effectual change, but just to increase my personal validation points. Get real.

If it's warm, fuck yeah, I'll walk. I love warm weather. But right now? Nop. I'm not trying to prove that I'm the most moral or the most green. I'm trying to get shit done. And walking a fucking hour to go three miles ain't getting shit done. I also don't litter, and pick up trash when able, and dispose of elections properly, and when I remember a reusable bag. But choosing a car when the weather is shit or you're just hella tired or lazy, is not an issue. Sorry bud.

If there was a massive national push to stop using cars, and I still choose a car, then I'd be completely in the wrong. But fuck outta here trying to shame people for making things easier for themselves, blaming them for pollution, when their choice has the most negligible effect.

What's that phrase? There's no ethical consumption under capitalism? And what the hell is a ""common worker""?

Edit: and like the other dude, you choose to criticize and force changes on regular people, instead of the root causes of pollution. Like the companies that could massively switch over to electric, or focus on efficiency rather than speed and power. You just choose to blame people, but only punish ""common workers"" and kids. Weird.

todayilearned,ff5jvp1,t1_ff5hk8r,1579596345.0,"How about increasing public transportation??? If good enough, you wouldn't even need cars.

Wait, people should start walking, in order to make it safer for the people that were walking? Besides the weirdness of that, that would take a massive amount of drivers choosing to walk to make a noticeable change. There's a fancy chart I'm imagining where as more people choose to walk, the traffic danger steadily increases alongside the increase in the walkers' presence, not plateauing until a large amount of drivers choose to walk. And in any well populated metropolitan area, that is gonna take a fuckton of drivers choosing to walk to even start doing anything. Unless you live in a rural area, where traffic is already pretty low.

And I agree that city planners should start designing without the focus on personal vehicles being used. But unless you're going to just remove every vehicle in general, vehicle specific areas will have to exist. Bus depots and bus stops will need to exist. Rail based transportation will need tracks and stations. Maybe we could even develop tubes like from Futurama. But they'll take up space still.

Like you're technically right, in a ""moral"" sense. In the same way that nuking Japan saved millions of American lives. To start, you're trying to implement changes in other people's lives down to how healthy they are. Not very cash money of you, bro. Then, taking the average, you're asking people to spend an hour of effort travelling three miles, instead of taking, I think, 10 or so minutes by vehicle. And then another hour at least coming back. And that's if you are only going to just only one place. But humans desire comfort, and you're going backwards.

At what point is it ""fair"" to take a vehicle? I agree we should do away with personal cars entirely, but your alternative is not a better alternative. You're asking society to slow down. And that's only if everyone agrees and starts walking in order to cause a paradigm shift in the pace of things, based on everybody walking everywhere, now. If not enough people do it, though, you're just asking for a group of people to increase their efforts and difficulty, putting a huge strain on their time management, and removing a lot of free time. You're not offering any public transportation in your views, so I don't assume you do.

Wouldn't an ancap be okay with people driving, though? Or is this just a fantasy of your inner? Is the extent of your peak influence just shaking your fist at a passing vehicle while you're walking? Maybe starting a group?

What about the other massive forms of pollution that exist, that are not private consumers stuck with the limitations of our choices of total available vehicles that produce pollution and those that don't, that is inherent in our current capitalistic system? Why would you make the people walk, instead of making the corporations create a better product so they don't have to walk? You say you don't want a state, but you want to make people do things your way, which directly increases difficulty and effort, while not going after the root of pollution. The ""an"" in ""ancap"" stands for Anarchy, right? Something just doesn't add up

I totally agree with the selectiveness. At least prove yourself willing to work for the group. I'd believe it'd be numerous population limited communities. You'd have to implement some form of control in regards to population and how resources are gathered and used.

And if you add in other communities working towards their own goals, but also in a close alliance with another close community or communities for a collective defense and trading for resources, then that also encourages success. But corruption and power struggles will always happen, and that is why I believe a universal centralized communist society is impossible.

Like, I'm an anarchist at heart (not really in a political sense, though), and I had to recognize that it's impossible that everyone would be okay with a singular system. So the best that can done is to carve out a private society to exist within, hoping that there isn't a massive military resistance. Or carve out a place through force, and the ability to defend your existence. It'd take a massively armed force or a sympathetic country that helps to do that, though. But that's banking on fantasies.

I've had fantasies of building a utilitarian free society in the ocean. Like modular floating platforms with residential buildings, energy production, goods production (whatever is available to produce, honestly. Might not even be possible/worth it), waste management, things like that. At first, it'll be basic cabins, basic gardens, no goods production, and would need to be building electricity generators, immediately. I'd think ocean powered generators (underwater currents, tidal and waves, maybe even geothermal), solar, wind, and even nuclear should be used (very carefully with multiple contingency plans).

And I like to think, as the size grows, energy production grows, and energy would be able to sold, legitimizing the community. Depending on production capabilities, products could possibly be sold. But products should be specifically made to be used by the community. Everything made has a direct purpose, I guess spare parts or things like that. But the main focus will be on energy and food production. Farming first may be a huge contributor. 

It would also 'have' to be populated by heavily armed and, at least in the beginning, intelligent and educated people dedicated to the mission and greater good in order to ever be successful. So maybe a group of civil providers, and a group of militant providers. Two different production goals, in a symbiotic relationship. But this is just a fantasy of mine I like to think about sometimes. 

The current system can't just be changed in a sudden paradigm shift, and the resulting society be in a well enough place to grow from. So I believe we're stuck with playing the game within the rules to the best of our abilities, or strive for a global transvaluation of values; an ascension of humanity's morals and ethics to a utilitarian point of view.

I dunno. My plan is to try and form a political action group. No violent stuff. But pretty much just to try to sway the public opinion, at least locally, away from the two party conflict, and back to representing not the interests of the party, but the interests of the normal everyday citizens you're representing, not just those that are in your political party. At it's core, it's inspired by George Washington's Farewell Address and his warnings of letting a multiple party system get too powerful. And also Theodore Roosevelt's "" The Duties of American Citizenship."" Very good and dope read. 


It'd be an attempt at a modern People's Party, but will also behave as a civilian focused think-tank to formally involve normal citizens into the political system, which is the intended goal. In 1891, American agrarian workers formed the People's Party to stand against the current corporate leaning politicians and empower small farmers and laborers. They collapsed, though. Woops. 

I truly want to raise the wealth of every citizen by tying their finances, possibly even their social security, to a small portion of an American corporation's profits and financial growth, or maybe even an entire industry's financial growth, so no one company bares the burden the most. But as a corporation's or industry's financial standing increases and the economy grows, the wealth of every citizen should increase alongside. It's a weird area, but I'm sure there's a way to present this as a benefit; at least for America as a whole. As America's total civil wealth grows, America becomes wealthier. American's quality of life increases. Citizens are more free to pursue special interests. More people can become scientists and engineers, doctors, artists, teachers, or business owners. There won't be much financial burden on a citizen's choice. Local municipal projects could be funded directly by citizens instead of bureaucratic budgeting and policies.

I just want to get rid of detrimental poverty, personally. That's what personally affected me most in my life, and still does to a degree."

But, communism is only reached once the State ceases to exist. The goal of communism is to be a free society, not coerced into working for corporations, but working to provide essentials for the group. After the revolution and after the proletariat being in charge, after they used the state to change the way society works and flows, the state is to wither away, for there is no reason for a state when the community is working together to provide for the community. And any communism that doesn't have their people and workers massively armed, then it isn't communism. Lenin made the state vital, and also committed disgusting acts of wanton slaughter against the very people communism is supposed to be freeing. He created a blood thirsty cult and secured absolute power. He didn't bring in communism. Fuck Lenin. And what's even worse, is Ford and other American companies helped build the industries that would then drive the USSR into the history books. 

Mao is just fucking insane and is pure garbage. He did what Lenin did but arguably more mentally fucked up and damaging to his people. He spurred on, encouraged, and manipulated Chinese folks into a paranoid bloodthirsty mass hysteria. He'd tell students and radicals to attack the headquarters of the bourgeoisie, without ever naming what or who that is. This was after the revolution was already won, as well. But this is was a ""cultural revolution"".

He kept stoking the fires causing massive conflict against ""counter-revolutionaries"", causing whole portions of communities being killed, exiled, or put into labor camps. He encouraged forming many different militias and also  insurrection. Many militias assumed authority of cities and territories through sheer force, while battling the military and other opposing militias. He was in total control. He had absolute power. But he didn't try to liberate the peasantry or workers. He created a massive cult following for himself and the CPC that lasts till this day. 

And then Mao gave them like 40 fucking mangoes and China collectively lost their entire minds and shit themselves over such a Divine and humbling gesture. 

China is fucking weird. But they are not allowing the state to decay, nor did the USSR. Or any other modern socialist state you find. I believe Marx's communism can only ever be achieved in a small simple society, like an agrarian society. Or a hyper Hi-Tech society where everything that is essential to human existence and progress, like energy, food, essential materials, and even luxury goods. In such a hi-tech society, it would free humanity to explore many new things. You could fully explore your passions. You could build video games still. Not so much in an agrarian society, though.

Anyway, I took a couple dabs and I was having fun writing. I am not trying to knock you or oppose you. I'm just stoned and bored. But modern day socialist states are decidedly fucked up and disgusting. But personally, I wouldn't consider it communism. Maybe socialism, at least nowadays.
