There's an age in which the conversation is acceptable, and an age in which that conversation is inappropriate. If you think it's okay to talk to a 6 year old about being a different gender, and call me entitled for asking for a reason, while ALSO calling me a piece of shit for asking, then you're the piece of shit. Plain and simple."
SelfAwarewolves,ffavjw7,t1_ffauonj,1579745484.0,"So I guess the alternative is that we should talk to 6 year olds about sexuality and gender identity, because they're definitely mentally equipped to handle that conversation. Yeah you're right, that's really not worth saying, it's better to pretend to have a point that isn't that one."

SelfAwarewolves,ffar7hh,t3_esbz5o,1579742594.0,"Ok I'm gonna play devil's advocate for a second. He does partially have a point because if we are talking about *extreme left* there are things that can be said about how they expose their kids to these sorts of sexual decisions and identities before they even reach the age of reason. I'm NOT saying that it's bad to embrace your child's tendency to do something, but if you constantly tell a 6 year old boy ""hey. Hey are you a girl? Because it's cool if you're a girl. Oh okay just making sure because if you were a girl that would be totally fine, so if you feel like a girl let me know. Hey are you still a boy? Oh okay, just checking"" like yeah I think that's unnecessary. 

That is just stuff that you as a parent should pick up on if they deliberately express themselves in a manner that suggests that change. It shouldn't be explicitly brought up to them as a label until later on when they can process this sort of thing on s higher level. You can give a 6 year old the option to jump off a cliff and they might just do it because why the fuck not, they're 6.

insaneparents,ff8mqm7,t3_es4eey,1579686265.0,"Did she just say that the curriculum included praying to Allah 5 times a day? And 65 people believed that?

I grew up in Italy and went to a private Catholic elementary school. They had a reputation in my city for being just objectively a better school, as long as you paid (they would let 1 less fortunate kid a year go there for free) so my family made financial sacrifices for me to be in there. 

The school didn't get that reputation by not teaching you shit because ""it would make Jesus cry"". Anyone with half a brain understands the value of knowledge and the value of introducing cultural awareness to children, especially in the most globally connected time in history. 

Religion had its own class and it was a straight up well grounded real class, at an elementary level. We studied all the major religions objectively and openly. 

So I don't understand, since they're Roman Catholic, is a private Catholic school located within the nation that is at the very core of Catholicism still not Catholic enough for them or something?

Nah. Probably not that. It's probably that she is..unimpressive?"

tifu,ff5ekwj,t1_ff2rb89,1579589540.0,"Sorry for the late reply, I've been slowly trying to get through some of the comments. 

Personally to be honest no I haven't seen any delay at all, in fact she seems to be fairly talented with anything involving communication. She stopped speaking Italian as much recently but there are still specific words she chooses to say in that language. She just hears English more often so she gravitates towards that language. 

Twins are a breed all on their own though, so all I can honestly say is that if I were you I wouldn't worry about basing their development off of my own child's or anyone else's development. 

If an actual professional in a relevant field says there is a problem with development and that there is something that needs to be done, then I would start worrying a little, but with twins it could be an entirely different ball game because they are so in sync with one another and sometimes I hear it's almost like they can practically read each other's minds.

tifu,ff2knd5,t1_ff2k5t4,1579510536.0,"Nah it was literally like me pretty much moving on with the conversation, her moving on with me, and then me just saying ""oh by the way, try not to say that, that was my bad though"".

tifu,ff2jroj,t1_ff2isec,1579509313.0,"I tried to teach myself French with Duo Lingo but got lazy. I found out that french and Italian are almost identical grammatically, and pretty much just have different words. I suppose it's just a mix of Anglo-Saxon and Germanic accents adopting the Latin and Greek root to the point of becoming a language. I don't know, but I know that the two languages when written look like two dialects of the same language"
tifu,ff2gjj6,t1_ff2e8al,1579505184.0,"I opened an applesauce thingy, I spread peanut butter on bread, and warmed up leftover pasta. I would hardly call myself a chef for prepping that. It was just a little annoying out of principle. I wouldn't just let her go hungry because she is indecisive. Right after this story she literally just asked for a *piece of bread* while she watched Frozen, asked for permission to get comfy while eating, I let her, and she sat there in her bean bag happy, ate the whole slice of bread by itself; this fits with how she was talking about her tummy aching. 

So to answer your question, my daughter doesn't randomly decide she doesn't want something she found delicious a second before, unless there is a reason. This lead me to accommodate for it. So by preparing different things for her, but showing my discomfort with having to do it, I showed her that I don't mind going the extra mile as long as there is a purpose.

Maybe next time, because of this, she'll be more mindful and save everyone including herself, some discomfort. She'll just tell me right off the bat that maybe she just needs some bread to fill her stomach. I don't know. But she does now. And she can tell me. She taught herself that, on that day."
tifu,ff2fti7,t1_ff2ea5h,1579504318.0,"I already do. My mom is born and raised, I moved to Italy at like 9 months old so just raised lol so I speak both, and she mostly speaks Italian to her, always, unless it's important she understands immediately. Teaching your kids 2 languages at once has very high reward, very little risk, and very little drawbacks.

The rewards are positive cognitive response, a larger insight on communication as a whole, and supposedly higher emotional maturity I guess. On top of just being naturally better at languages than their peers.

What I mean is, she has two different ways of speaking and understanding in her head. She has to differentiate them emotionally and factually. All of this basically just makes her brain work harder to interact. That is good in the long run.

The only risk is temporary, because you may have to deal with ignorant people trying to tell you that you're doing a disservice to your kid. Those people are just dead wrong, for a variety of reasons. 

The drawback is a short period of time in which your kid will have to understand this difference. Other kids only understand that language, other parents only understand that language. It's not ""confusing"" but it IS something that they'll quickly have to get aware of.

All in all, if you know 2 languages fluently, use them."

tifu,ff2e2ym,t1_ff2c0w6,1579502351.0,Italian. Technically my first language but I haven't used it in an academic setting since 8th grade (switched to American high school) so it's actually kinda interesting that I have better immediate understanding of anything being said to me in that language but I don't have the ability to be nearly as creative with how I would retort. On the other hand English takes an extra fraction of a second to process but yet I'm much more proficient at using it expressively.
tifu,ff2dk6m,t1_ff2c30w,1579501792.0,"Yeah, I hear you, and that honestly might happen at a certain point. And I'm okay, I'm ready for that conversation, and I would want my daughter to be in there for it. It would go like:

""Oh what did she say?""

""She said *fuck*"" or whatever.

""Oh okay, so she didn't insult anyone though?"" 

""Nah but she still can't just be cursing."" 

""Fair enough. Okay you heard the boss, it's a rule, gotta keep it to yourself in class"".

tifu,ff2b31n,t1_ff29i19,1579499270.0,"Nah, I know exactly what you're talking about. I've actually put a good bit of thought into it, and with the help of some videos that broke down the usage of curse words I think I kinda found a good balance. 

The main idea is that curse words are meant to be words that have an edge to them right? So that relates to why they aren't socially appropriate everywhere. So the point I wanna instill is that they are not ""baaaaad"" words, but they are words that hold as much power as the context in which they are used. You wanna curse every other word? The words are gonna lose their edge and all you have left is emotionally hollow sentences. If you try too hard not to ever use them then anytime you're overwhelmed and you curse it'll seem like the end of the world. If you use curse words occasionally in the right place at the right time there's nothing wrong with it. 

So long story short, there's nothing wrong with letting a child be aware of how certain taboo words are used without encouraging the usage. The final message should ultimately be ""these are not to be used lightly"" right? Lol"

Especially wiith kids that young that are still trying to figure out what words mean and the concept behind them, the intent of the usage is more important than the literal meaning. 

What I mean is, calling someone stupid is worse than just saying ""aw shit that hurt"" because one in a sense is just an informal, healthy way of dealing with immediate stress, that they probably picked up from seeing or hearing someone else in a similar situation. While the other one shows malicious intent to hurt someone's feelings.

EntitledBitch,fem7wf7,t1_felsjj1,1579242957.0,"I understand where you're coming from, but these animals (maybe cats not quite as much as dogs, but still) form a bond with this person. So even though there's partial merit to adopting at all, it kinda gets instantly negated the moment you break this pet's heart because you either had different expectations, or your plans change. Go in person and figure out who you vibe with the best. Of course there's going to most likely be partially a matter of appearance and personal preference ( for example I'm not crazy about small dogs, I grew up with fairly large pitbulls and a lot of small dogs just always seem so tense, fragile, and obnoxiously loud, so unless it's for a good reason I probably wouldn't go out and look for that type of dog ), but personally it just struck me that someone could just be like ""yep, I'm gonna get this cat because I looked it up on Google images"". Then seriously just go buy one so that it's young enough to incorporate better.

It's just how I look at it, but my entire family has always been very active when it comes to animals in general but especially shelters, adoption, and so on. So maybe it's just shocking to me that someone could just so easily turn this into such a mundane process, like she was picking a vacuum."
EntitledBitch,felpi7j,t1_feljwlr,1579227780.0,"In this context it was uncalled for, I'm generalizing because of the question posed in the comment prior. The bottom line is that you shouldn't start off with a request for a specific breed if you're gonna go adopt. Go look at them and see if there's one that appeals to you, don't just lead with an aesthetic. 

Really, you would rather they adopt? Are you sure? Because someone who starts off with that kind of mentality is way more likely to just drop the pet right back off the moment they have a problem. Seen it happen with cats, seen it happen with dogs. So I disagree, it's not just ""oh fuck it just give them what they want if we got it"" because you wanna make sure that this person actually cares about the animal and not about the ""aesthetics"" as she so eloquently put it."

unpopularopinion,fe6ttai,t1_fe6m4nm,1578905119.0,"Wtf are you talking about? Are you talking about being a server? Are you talking about jobs in general? I got an associate's just so I could keep colleges away from looking at my high school grades, because reasons that I've shared on Reddit before, literally just as a strategic move to ensure I could still get further in life, and now I found a job that pays  22 an hour base pay, 33 on Saturday, 44 on Sunday, and 66 on holidays. If I didn't have expenses that weren't up to me, I would be making pretty damn good. After 2 years of going to school. My gross income was 52K at the end of the year, and I got taxed for almost a quarter of it because I'm in the low end of people making just a tiny little bit more than the lower tax bracket. I would get a lot of it back on my tax return if it wasn't for the fact that most of that goes to the mother of my child for simply existing. So I get none of it. So what are you complaining about when you are working an entry level job while others have put time and effort into getting a better job for themselves and still get barely more than others on an entry level job because of how the system is set up? You get no sympathy from me. 

I'm not saying that you're wrong about everyone getting ripped off by this bullshit. What I AM saying is yeah sure, blame the government for low tips, that'll get you places. ""Lmao"" I'm confused about what your actual point is. 

""Hey guys, the wage hasn't gone up in 40 years, that's why I can't pay for my ticket okay?"" Yeah, oh god, what shall we do Stephanie? We must accommodate..."
unpopularopinion,fe6jvu8,t1_fe6hees,1578893287.0,"Your comment reminded me of something though, I just added it in an edit:

The customer is essentially the only individual here that is immune to criticism. It's the customer. Your employer, your supervisor, and your co-workers will not, and cannot, back you up on this. It is unproductive to focus on that aspect.

The best course of action is to Target the employer and argue for a slow shift to, for example, a $2 tip fee to the receipt. Now I'm legally forced to pay at least that, and I can add something to it if I so choose, instead of starting from 0.

Once you succeed in that, it's a domino effect leading to fair wages."
unpopularopinion,fe6igtq,t1_fe6hees,1578891932.0,"I live in the states. I understand. I used to struggle to make ends meet, and occasionally still do. And I have never not tipped anyone. Like I said they have my sympathy up until the point of constantly complaining about it. That's when I go from feeling bad that they gotta make it with tips, to feeling like they're just entitled, as if I'm supposed to just empty my bank account and get on my hands and knees because they asked me if I want more water.

Also, most jobs will get around your schedule. You leave your availability completely open on an application and then discuss during the interview. That's how I used to do it. There's ways around this, I've worked jobs that had NO wage, JUST tips, like bagging, people would buy 400 dollars worth of food that they sometimes got very particular about how they wanted it, put it in 3 carts, juggle with these carts all the way to their car, load everything up, and get one or two dollars. Shit sucks. It's still not their problem, obviously they said ""oh I'm not obligated to pay you? I already spent 400 dollars on food bud, good luck"". Tough shit for me. It is what it is. The difference is in the States there's always something better out there, no matter the circumstances, but if you go ""nah I'm comfortable just rationalizing my problems"" then cool beans, just don't expect.. much lol"
EntitledBitch,fe5ffpu,t3_enn2yq,1578868852.0,"Why would anyone tip by percentages? I tipped 20-30 dollars when I went to this super nice Brazilian restaurant on a date with my SO because from the moment I sat down to the moment I left they treated me like a king to the point it made me almost uncomfortable.

That's it. I'm not giving out 8-10 dollars at an Applebee's for bringing me a plate and filling up a cup twice. 3 to 5 dollars seems to be what your service was worth. Not because it's cheap service, but because you just... You didn't do much lol if I have my daughter with me and she makes a little messy I throw in an extra 3-4 dollars for the trouble. If you think I'm an asshole for paying you what I thought your service was worth rather than based on my receipt, when I could just not give you anything at all, then tough shit. Start looking for a different job. 

I'll always say this. Shit sucks sometimes, but it's not my fault, nor am I responsible for compensating for your shitty situation. Work towards getting to a situation that doesn't suck."

Is this a general statement or based on the setup like the rest of his answer? Either way the 2 wires are going straight to and from his wrist, which would make it extremely hard for current to reach any vital organ. People have been struck by lightning and survived, I'll let you use your imagination for how much voltage is in that. 

Bottom line, that just plain doesn't make sense. If you have 4000 volts and little to no current, there just aren't enough electrons jumping from one place to the other to release the kind of energy that would kill you. 

Correct me if I'm wrong please, but 4kV of potential with 1 uA put us at 4 mW of power. That ain't shit."

Seriously though, fuck this war. Like I said before, there is no honor or freedom for fighting when the people starting all this shit never see the consequences of their actions first hand. If you are deemed the cause of a fucking war, you should be handed a camo vest, tossed a rifle, and kicked in the ass all the way up to the front line. Then we'll see how many wars get started since that law is implemented. But we all know it's never gonna happen, right? So where is the freedom that people are fighting for when these people have been free to start wars on our behalf? Where is the honor in doing so when these people face no consequences? Don't do it guys. I was an army brat, I didn't see the bad bad shit but I did see the outcome. Spouses been held hostage, occasionally resulting in a suicide or murder-suicide. People getting out realizing that it's harder to get a job when they are seen as a potential liability due to PTSD. If you are lucky, and incorporate that Army lifestyle all the way to the core (and survive) you might earn a rank high enough for you to be so smug and pretentious that you're gonna hate yourself. That's the ultimate prize. Thinking you are the shit in a uniform because that's the only environment your life decisions will have value by that point because after 25 years in the service, the moment you step into those blue jeans you are the guy who didn't do shit with his life other than submit it to your government.

Soldiers are cool, and I feel sorry for them. But fuck the military as an organization. It's fucking disgusting."
educationalgifs,fdhy6nf,t1_fdhfkiq,1578432306.0,"That's fair, I usually like to be significantly fucked up on something if I'm attending an event of this sort, so I would probably just rather lean towards a mixture of alcohol and/or ex/MDMA. 

Micro dosing at a rave sounds okay, but part of why I trip is the visual impact and heavily altered mindset, if I took that away I would just feel like I'm missing something for the experience to be complete. 

Last time I went to a rave I found out why alcohol and LSD don't mix well, and it was in an area I was completely unfamiliar with to make matters worse. Never getting drunk while tripping again."

educationalgifs,fdghptw,t1_fdgdn3u,1578397281.0,"No, don't try it at a rave your first time, I don't recommend it. Your first trip should be in a place you are comfortable, with people you feel comfortable, with lots of water, snacks, activities, movies, blah blah blah. Once you know what you're in for, do whatever gets you hard. The point is that LSD is very unpredictable depending on the person, and you can't know how you will feel on it until you try it. So you don't wanna find out at a rave that LSD is not for you. 

Honestly though, LSD doesn't even sound great for a rave. Candy flipping yeah definitely, but JUST LSD? In a loud ass place? Full of people getting in your personal space who don't care that you're tripping? I don't know, that seems awkward to me unless I'm on other substances like uppers."

Spain is nice, Barcelona has a Dalí museum that is.. interesting. Lots to do in the downtown strip including a sex museum. Croatia has some great beaches and is really cheap. France of course has one of the most famous monuments in the world. Malta is right off the coast of Sicily, it's a great vacation spot but is pretty much just that, a tourist vacation resort. Berlin is nice and Germany has just downright amazing public transportation. Austria will give you a taste of life in the Alps region. Very traditional."
