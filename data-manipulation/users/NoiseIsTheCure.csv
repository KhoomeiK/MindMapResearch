The American people didn't deserve such a terrible thing, but the United States, the international bully, deserves being knocked down a peg. I'm not justifying or defending 9/11 in the slightest, just saying that 9/11 was intended to be retribution for the atrocities we've committed. Unfortunately more evil people were behind it and so more innocent people were murdered. But how many innocent people have been murdered in Middle Eastern conflicts since 2001? Easily more than 3000. There are no more good guys in today's wars. Only the bad guys with more money and better public relations."

blursedimages,fcy2odb,t1_fcxd2rx,1578074006.0,"I'm definitely anti-religious institutions, but I don't really care what people personally believe, people can believe whatever they want. One of the main reasons religious people can be annoying with shoving their religious in our faces is because the institution they answer to tells them to.   

Just look at the Catholic church. I don't think I've ever heard of someone who enjoys and really gets fulfilled by being catholic, and that's because the Catholic church is what you get when you take the ritualistic guilt tripping and snorefest aspects of Christianity, and combine it with the power hunger of politics. Religious institutions just take what I think should be a personal philosophical journey and make it into another government system to mindlessly answer to.  

Comparisment is pure evil though"
blursedimages,fcy1kjf,t1_fcxjhv6,1578073440.0,I'd say most people on reddit either generically believe believe in God or aren't religious/don't care. I say that just because reddit is mostly American and most Americans are reluctant to come out and say they definitely are atheist or they definitely don't believe in God. That's just the feeling I get from the most people though. Lotta people go to church on the special occasions and they'll thank God for things because that's how they were raised and they don't give it more thought than that.

AskReddit,fct41j2,t1_fct1sk3,1577932323.0,"To fully understand poetry, we must first be fluent with its meter, rhyme and figures of speech, then ask two questions: 1) How artfully has the objective of the poem been rendered and 2) How important is that objective? Question 1 rates the poem's perfection; question 2 rates its importance. And once these questions have been answered, determining the poem's greatness becomes a relatively simple matter. If the poem's score for perfection is plotted on the horizontal of a graph and its importance is plotted on the vertical, then calculating the total area of the poem yields the measure of its greatness. A sonnet by Byron might score high on the vertical but only average on the horizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on the other hand, would score high both horizontally and vertically, yielding a massive total area, thereby revealing the poem to be truly great. As you proceed through the poetry in this book, practice this rating method. As your ability to evaluate poems in this matter grows, so will, so will your enjoyment and understanding of poetry."""
WhitePeopleTwitter,fcsk35y,t1_fcsi9ky,1577918152.0,"Totally reasonable. I'm not arguing against covering the mouth, I'm more arguing against the perception that it's a matter of politeness vs rudeness. Sometimes I cover my mouth, sometimes I don't. The majority of situations it doesn't matter which one I do. I guess if I always cover my mouth, then I'm always covered and for that reason I see your argument, but overall it's not that big a deal, obviously nothing that can't be solved by a simple aside ""sorry"" if it actually did come off as rude. Personal offense over minor rules of etiquette is very petty."

There is no such objective thing as ""fine"" or ""not fine"" or ""good"" or ""shitty"" or ""kinda alright but could use some salt"", those concepts only exist as a value judgment that we as intelligent life apply to things in our world.

Obviously the likelihood we're completely unique in being a planet with intelligent life is increasingly small, but we also have not discovered any other planets with an abundance of life like ours, *and* even if we did find a planet with an abundance of life, it's pretty unlikely that it'd have the same stuff, eg flora and fauna as we know it. It'd have it's own unique flora and fauna.    

So from a perspective of preservation, we kill off everything on earth, yeah there might be another planet teeming with life elsewhere, but is there another planet with the kind of life we have? Is there another planet with plants and animals like ours? Maybe the flora and fauna would be similar on a fundamental level, but I doubt you'd find a planet with stuff very much like ours because every planet has its own unique conditions.    

There might very well be a creature out there reminiscent of a wooly mammoth, but I think it's not unreasonable to say that all the actual wooly mammoths as we know them in the universe are extinct.
