Take this opportunity to let other people review yours, and get as much feed back as you can from coworkers, who may have noticed ""important"" things you may not have considered to be worth mentioning. 

Also, look for plugins to Word or a website that you can paste a job description into, and figure out what the wordcount is for certain keywords, then make sure those are in your résumé. Since the first pass is done by computers now, SEO is basically the name of the game, and keyword spamming is the best way to get past the HR filter.
