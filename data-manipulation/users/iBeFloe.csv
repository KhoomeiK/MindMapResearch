Of course he’d appear calm. A puppy won’t be perfect from day 1... Puppies, just like babies, need time to learn & understand. This is a life long process & commitment. Were you or your mother perfect babies? I don’t think so.

The entire family needs to work on training him, not just you. And you yourself need to improve on how you train him. If neither of you are up for a long term commitment that comes with him making mistakes, I don’t think any of you are ready for a puppy."
