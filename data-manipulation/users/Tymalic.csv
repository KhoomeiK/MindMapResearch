His politics distilled through the years has landed him slightly to left of FDR. Which is a good formula, I think, to begin the regrowth of labor in this country."

This is very much a different presidency than anyone alive has seen in that the party he will have brought victory to, will hate him for it."

But I totally plan on running for office with the intent to prosecute current AND PAST corruption. There's nothing more I want than to see Cheney and Bush in front of the Hague. I won't send Obama there. He gets the American courts for killing American citizens abroad without judicial oversight.

Worker productivity is up 300% since the 80s. Pay is down 10%.

Bud, I just don't think you realize what's going on...Marx laid it out like this. Capitalism is a race towards the bottom. He surmised that capitalism will keep lowering wages and benefits until the average person can't afford the own goods they produce.

The government has failed. The courts have failed. Our institutions are being exposed as being tied together with this ""glue"" that can only be described as a honor system.

No, this is not about normalizing. This system was never normal or good or wise. This is about using it and not hiding it. That's all this is. The only thing that is going to fix this is massive structural change. We have one more election. After that, I think we all know the hard answer."
