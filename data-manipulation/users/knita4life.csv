funny,fflrf2u,t3_etwczy,1580043210.0,"Reality Check:

The average person in China doesn't live in a mud hut with their animals as some people are suggesting. Conditions in the poorest, most rural areas are rough but that is not representative of all of China or even all rural areas. In Zhejiang people in a rural villages might  have newly renovated houses with flat screen TV's and an SUV. Go to Sichuan and there are people with no electricity or running water.

Bats, Snakes, and Koalas are not things commonly eaten in China. 

Hygienic conditions in small towns and cities can be so-so at times but in bigger cities it's not much worse than any other large city. 

As always, old people don't like/accept change. They spit, blow their nose on the sidewalk, let grandkids pee on the ground. They eat weird things as cures for their various old people ailments. No one can tell them anything... they are the Chinese equivalent of baby boomers. No one under 40 behaves this way.

Most people then spend the next two weeks in their hometowns, visiting family, going to tourist sites etc. A small portion of people who can afford it may go on trips abroad, but it seems like most people choose to spend that time in their hometown since they may not be able to go back very often because of work or studies."

The sources are different though because many of them are legitimate sources- they have authors, dates, are peer reviewed, and are published through credible organizations.

I picked Yiwu because I have lived there and have travelled between Beijing and Yiwu many times: it's 1441 Kilometers (895) miles. That wasn't even the final stop on this particular route. That's about the distance from New York City to Nashville. There's no way you're getting to Little Rock without at least two stopovers.
todayilearned,fem2lyk,t3_epsvd0,1579237704.0,"What no one in the US seems to consider is capacity. There are only so many flights per day and you can only put so many people on each flight. Every flight is totally booked. Meaning that if you need to switch flights or your flight gets cancelled you're screwed.  I've never had this problem in China. Not only that, but there's more competition, better service, and the system isn't plagued with cancellations, delays and overbooking. High speed also directly connects smaller cities and rural areas to larger cities without having 5 stopovers.

China,feg5agh,t3_eowap0,1579077578.0,Makeup days are pretty normal but usually they don't have you make up every day. Your company is either very stingy with holidays or they are pretending to be hard working because it's the 70th anniversary of the PRC and they're trying to make themselves look good. I work for a university and we have no make up days for Spring Festival... so it can also depend on the industry.

TEFL,fd2x11s,t1_fd2tkpq,1578152461.0," As of 2018 you basically have no choice but to return home. Most employers will not give you the release documents until the last working day on your contract. At which point you will not have enough time to apply for and receive the new documents. You can get a temp visa that gives you a little more time in China, but that's about it. If you try leave early, most employers will simply refuse to transfer the visa so you end up in the same situation."
TEFL,fd2fp8z,t1_fd28ut9,1578146548.0,"They have already violated your contract once, they will do it again. 

Plus, the law in China is that you have to return to your home country between jobs. So, what's written in your contract means nothing. Lying to the police about your residence is a bad, bad sign. The fact that they had to get a 30 day extension is also deeply suspicious.

 I also have suspicions about the legality of what they're doing. Drug use generally prevents you from getting a work visa. The fact that they didn't do the TEFL training, which is a legal requirement as far as I know, is a giant red flag. Do you have a real Z visa and a work permit card? How could you stay in this other girls apartment (for weeks?!!)  when you need the landlord to go with you to register with the police within 24 hours? Why would your entire housing allowance go to her?

If you leave this job, you cannot simply get another job. You will need to cancel your work visa and return to your home country. I would love to know the details of this contract that you will regret leaving so much. 

Be careful. Training centers are notorious for screwing people over. Make sure everything is done according to the law and if its not get the hell out."
