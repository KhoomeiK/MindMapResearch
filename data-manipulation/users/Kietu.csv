The animals we farm, rape, child-separate, boil alive, mutilate from infancy, and then slaughter are self-conscious. They suffer just like you or me. You are simply biased because of how normalized this is. We all grew up thinking this was ok, but many are realizing it simply is indefensible. Can you name a trait that is true of farm animals which, if true of humans would justify killing/eating humans?"

I appreciate how open minded you're being. If you have some free time please watch Earthlings, which was made by Joaquin Phoenix.

Last thing I'll say: making the switch is hard, because it forces you to confront the suffering that humans cause. It's fucking sad. But it's really worth it on a personal level.

I think that what it comes down to is it causes so much suffering. So much it's almost unimaginable. Watch movies like dominion or earthlings to get a sense of the pain. Watch the game changers to get a sense of the myths about health. Even dairy is horrific, since it requires raping the cow and then forcefully separating the newborn calf from its mother. These creatures feel pain.

I'm not against your religion, but I hope you see that religion can't justify everything on its own. The Bible justifies slavery and a lot of brutal stuff, for example.

I think the real reason people eat so many animals is what you said, that it's normal. And just like many people didn't care too much about slavery in the US when it was happening because it was so normal, people currently don't care about what is an actual animal holocaust. 150 billion a year. It destroys the planet as well, but to me that's secondary to respecting that these beings want to live and want to be with their children, u no?

I don't know how to make this compelling for you, because I don't know you personally, but imagine yourself vegan for a year and think about how it would feel to know you aren't paying people to do these horrible things for your enjoyment. I don't want to assume anything, but wouldn't you feel closer to yourself, the world, and your faith?

Once again, I'm not talking about the environment and I haven't been for quite some time, yet you continue using that word lol. 

If you need it put in the exact right context, then here goes:

Our existence is fundamentally immoral. Perhaps in the future we will find ways to synthesize food and materials to such an extent that we will not harm anything, but for now the clear imperative is either to kill yourself (purely utilitarian) or to minimize the harm you do, to whatever extent reasonable, while you try to reframe morality to include humans.

If a wild animal attacks you, you are being victimized by the animal, not by the person who once fed the animal.

You are saying here that ""for good or bad, people don't make a big deal out of women groping each other."" And yes, that's my point.

Women can sexually assault women. If you want to go ahead and explain why sexuality somehow can negate sexual assault, be my guest."
Unexpected,fevq0pf,t1_fevovm7,1579400091.0,"...yes we are. I'm saying that if the guy was replaced with a girl, it would be called sexual assault. Therefore there is a double standard AS IT RELATES TO SEXUAL ASSAULT."
Unexpected,fevadih,t1_fev8388,1579395067.0,"It has nothing to do with sexual orientation. If a woman was dancing with a guy and then a woman came up to her and groped her, then it's sexual assault regardless of if the woman is gay or straight. It's not that complicated."
rickandmorty,feuo7ie,t3_eqnpz2,1579388404.0,"Well left meeseeks does die when Jerry does his thing. But it's true that middle didn't kill him. I wonder what would happen if you asked a meeseeks to set fire to a chair, and then before he has a chance to, you set fire to it."
Unexpected,feufldg,t1_feoyplq,1579386005.0,"""Shouldn't"" is odd here. I'm giving a scenario and only changing one variable: the guy is now a girl. It shows the double standards he have. A man's sexual assault is on r/funny.

If you are interested in a hypothetical wherein both are girls, then go right ahead and consider it."
Unexpected,feoomoj,t3_eq1sec,1579303148.0,Keep the same scenario but replace the main dude who got tricked with a woman. A guy deceiving and then groping a girl? You'd find THAT video on r/iamatotalpieceofshit.
toastme,feomuam,t3_eq4jll,1579302371.0,"I can only vaguely relate to the problem you're experiencing with your family, but I genuinely hope you find a way to feel happy or at least at ease. Life changes a lot, and it does so in the brief moments when you look away. You turn back and there it is, your life is different and you can't say for how long or what caused it. It's a nice feeling and I hope you feel it soon. If you ever need someone to talk to PM me I'd love to talk. Much love!"

toastme,feghgnu,t3_eoznk6,1579092887.0,"""Everything I am, I cannot stand."" This is a very sad and relateable statement; it is also kind of a wheelchair pun.

I have a practical suggestion: take 5 grams of dried psilocybin mushrooms. PM for more info.

On a less practical note, I hope you can just find little things that bring you amazement. Honestly, we are always seeking so much, but it's as though we've signed onto this lie that life is boring. It isn't, and even as I write this I don't believe myself because of how trained we all are to see it as lame. Like, it's insane that you're just a lifeform. Look at your surroundings. Write about your thoughts. Idk man I think you gotta start loving the shit everyone finds mundane. 

I hope you feel something. I have been numb like that and often still am. Don't shy away from feeling sad; it's a gateway to joy."
