dating,fdlrmse,t3_elyr6f,1578530853.0,"For me, It would be very intimidating to have the second date be among friends. But.... If I were also interested in the girl I would jump on it in a heart beat. It means she is definitely interested in me, it provides a great opportunity to see her in her own element, and hopefully, gain the approval of those who are close to her. 

If you feel tentative about him, or are unsure of your feelings then this isn’t a good option. But if you are confident, I think it’s a good move. 

As for the city difference and staying the night, just be upfront about it. If he likes you for you he’ll understand and feel grateful that things are moving in a romantic direction. If he declines because of that, he’s a tool and doesn’t deserve your affection."
INTP,fdlmszr,t1_fdi6edf,1578527578.0,I’m with you on the witty humor part. I hadn’t put it in that perspective before. So thank you!

dating,fdhxv45,t3_elgssp,1578432136.0,"Sounds to me like you feel the need to be the superior human being in your relationships. No judgement on my part. Like you said you have mental health issues, which I can empathize with, and your thought process in dating might be a symptom of what you are going through. 

I think you are a logical and objective thinker, like myself. Almost everything we do requires objective data. Unfortunately relationships don’t work like that. Human thinking revolves around Ethos, Pathos, and Logos. Basically who, what, where, when, why. Most people tend to lean towards the ethos, or emotional path of thinking. 

I’d suggest watching Simon Sinek’s “Start with Why” TED talk. It does a great job of explaining emotional communication to a logical audience. 

One more thought, from the studies I’ve read, (sorry I can’t source them right now), females are much more likely to settle on below their “league” individuals then men. This is indicative of the natural desire to have a stable, reliable, healthy companion to breed with. As much as we might like to think we are above animal instincts, it’s there. Good luck with everything."
INTP,fdhvqcp,t1_fdhtmg2,1578431011.0,"“Still a nobody” It seems to me that there is a lot of confirmation bias in what you are writing. 1. Internet addiction is a controversial subject, and hasn’t withstood the rigors of study. The direction of studies suggest that it is a symptom of other mental health disorders. And to reiterate what you stated in your last post, mental health disorders existed long before the internet. 

2. Why would you ever reply to this post with judgement, suggestions, or advice? My post was meant to be a small, qualitative study within a specific population. 

You should take your trolling elsewhere. I highly doubt you are an INTP based upon what you have written. And your persistence of providing unfounded judgement contributes nothing to this conversation. 

If you can’t provide a personal anecdote, whether in agreement or disagreement, then you have no business in contributing to this conversation."
INTP,fdhrt4i,t1_fdhqdqm,1578428930.0,"Wow, very harsh. I’m going to have to disagree with your assessment of my personality or use disorders. Mainly on the basis that I provided little context and a single simple example of my brain’s desire to be consuming information. And I certainly didn’t suggest that stimulation or consumption of information was limited to the internet. 

At the same I never stated the goal of information or knowledge consumption having the outcome of retaining all of the  information. 

Rather, I was asking if other INTP ‘s have issues with low stimulative activities. If you’re an INTP you could have just stated yes or no and provided a personal anecdote. What I gain or how I use the information I’m gathering from this post isn’t necessarily the business of others unless I willfully choose to disclose it. 

But thank you for providing your judgment otherwise."
FreeCompliments,fdfgjvy,t3_el1hat,1578361187.0,"One of these days soon, you’re gonna wake up recovered and well rested. You’ll feel like a whole new person. Keep your chin up and take care of yourself."
INTP,fdf07sy,t3_ekw954,1578350372.0,"I completely get this. To do these menial tasks, like washing dishes requires more motivation other than that it needs to be done *cough* girl coming over *cough*. 

I guess my brain works in such a way that it asks “what is being accomplished or achieved with this? Could my mental resources be spent in a more valuable way?”

My brain immediately weighs whether what will be accomplished with this task, versus another, is worth my time. 

It important to note that I’m single, I believe that if I were in a relationship the outcome of completing a cleaning task and accommodating my partners comfort would provide enough of a challenging objective to motivate me to complete these tasks. 

Of course this applies outside of household duties. I have a lot of autonomy at work, little direction from supervisors. So I tend to assign the more mundane, day-to-day tasks to my subordinates, that way I can focus on more complicated tasks that require more of a problem solving based method of working."

shingles,fcojmos,t3_ei9t0d,1577833881.0,"I don’t know the exact timing, but a few days before it was full on I started with having a persistent itch on my back. After a few days I woke up in the morning with pain on my chest. After looking in the mirror I saw the rash. I was ignorant of shingles so I thought it was a bug bite. After it didn’t subside I called my insurance companies nurses hotline and they said it was likely shingles and I started meds that day. It took about a week and a half to fully recover."
legaladvice,fcigeja,t3_edk4n3,1577662138.0,Good news. After the eviction judgement was place I filed a motion to vacate based up violation of procedural due process. I was successful it getting the judgement dismissed.
