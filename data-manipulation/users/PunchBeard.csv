Absolutely the same with me. I backed the game on a total whim and then forgot all about it. Then one day I get a KS update email and the gist of it was the designer asking the community to be civil on the KS message boards. Having not even thinking about the game in months I popped over to see what the deal was. I was super shocked and ended up posting a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/c8n70g/anybody_back_the_kickstarter_game_called_unbroken/) here on the r/Boardgames sub asking for any other backer to give a heads up about what was going on. It pretty much blew up with someone from GBS weighing in on the ""toxic"" KS community.

I remember when I was in my 20s my best friend was engaged to be married and a few weeks before the wedding his fiance died in a car accident. There's a long tragic story that goes a lot deeper than this (high school sweethearts who were saving themselves for marriage) but anyway a couple of weeks after the funeral he started going online and meeting girls for dates. This was late 90s when online dating seemed to be easier. I remember a bunch of our mutual friends were super pissed that he ""got over"" his fiance so quickly and was dating. I had to explain to them that they didn't know shit about shit. Because these two were together for almost 10 years. And when you've been with someone that long and you're not even *close* to being 30 years old shit is crazy. He went from ""I have someone I trust and love"" to ""I have a huge hole in my life and desperately need to fill it"". And sure enough, just as I predicted, he went on about 5 or 6 dates with 5 or 6 different girls and then didn't go out with anyone for like 3 or 4 years. The lady you went out with was probably the same thing."
AskReddit,ffg0520,t3_et0asi,1579895590.0,"I was the lead singer of a punk band in the 90s. We were all pretty young, like late teens and early 20s and all of us looked way younger than we really were. We also had some heavy Goth and Bondage overtones to our look. You form a ""Glam-Punk"" band and look like a bunch of skinny little fem-boys and you're definitely going to run into all sorts of weird women. 

I remember one time we opened an actual ""Bondage Show"". Like the show was basically a giant rack on stage where men and women in different types of bondage gear would tie each other up and do bondage shit while industrial and techno music played. IIRC they were some cabaret act from a larger city. We were the warm up act. These shows were actually a lot of fun and opened me up to a whole new world of kinky sex but a lot of the women I met at these shows were usually messed up. At this show I came off stage and we had loaded all of our stuff into the car and went back in to enjoy the show. Nice thing was that since I was a performer I drank free all night. Anyway I'm standing there minding my own business enjoying the show when some older lady (like late 30s at least) is sitting on a bar stool next to me. She gestures me over and  being a naive young dude I went over. She leans in close and tells me I'm hot. ""Cool. Thanks"" is all I could think to say. Next thing I know she grabbed me by the belt and somehow manged to shove here hands down my pants. By this point I'm freaking the fuck out and trying to pull away while everyone around us is just sort of standing around staring at me. I'm like trying to yell over the noise of the music for people to help me get this crazy bitch off me and everyone is just ignoring me. I pulled myself away from her so hard that she fell of the bar stool, and since her hand was still jammed down my pants she pulled me on top of her. The entire time I'm wondering why the fuck no one is helping me. 

Finally this guy I knew from the gay bars (my band was pretty popular in the gay bar scene in town) came over and freed me. I was totally out of breath and sort of shaken. Mostly because it was obvious that I was in a situation where someone was doing something to me that I didn't want and at least 30 people saw it, some were people I knew and considered friends, and not one single person besides some random gay punk guy I barely knew  offered me help.

This is actually a pretty big deal that no one seems to be noticing. And it's not something I can see any real way to fix. The only possible thing I can see to *maybe* fix this is either figure out a way to open up our system to more parties (which seems almost impossible) or maybe enact term limits for Congress and the Senate.

Personally the husband sounds like a selfish prick who probably uses threats of suicide as a weapon. If he's suicidal there's literally thousands of resources he can utilize to get better. It's not his wife's job to make him better.

Can anyone really blame her for leaving someone who's suicidal. It's not her fucking job to make him not be suicidal.

That's why I hate when people tell my I hate him because of so-called ""Mainstream Media"". No. No, that's not the reason.

So we got into **Talisman** and I've been a fan ever since. I get that it's not for everyone but I don't get the *Monopoly* levels of hate it receives. Without games like *Talisman* we wouldn't be playing games like *Gloomhaven*.

And speaking of **Gloomhaven**; that game is overrated. All the quests are basically the same thing (kill everything or race to the end of the board), it takes way too long to set up a scenario and the mechanics are unruly and overly complicated and seem to exist just to spite dice throws.

I always wanted to be a legit historian and almost majored in History and Anthropology in college but I chickened out and majored in something that would land me a good job. But I've always had a fascination with history and the people who study, record and talk about it. And for a guy who constantly claims he isn't a historian Dan Carlin is probably one of the greatest historians of our generation. He embodies every virtue I hoped I would have as a historian when it was my dream. He's knowledgeable and accurate and when he *does* let in some (minor) bias he always adds the caveat that it's really hard to look at past events without filtering them through our own personal experiences, thoughts and biases. Usually he'll phrase it like ""And people today might look at this and think.......but we have to remember that back then......"""

For example I play a lot of board games. I do other things too but board games is one of my favorite hobbies. And I've always wanted a Dice Tower. But even a cheap dice tower is like $20. $20 doesn't seem like a lot of money but to me I just couldn't bring myself to spend $20 or more on something that's so......specific. And unnecessary. I can roll dice with my hands; I've been doing it for years with no problems. Anyway my wife bought me a top of the line Dice Tower for Christmas. Like the best one she could find. Best present ever. 

What's even better though is if you can buy them something you know they would use but probably wouldn't even think to buy it for themselves. Like the professional grade juicer my wife bought me years ago. I don't use it every day but damn am I glad I have it because when I *do* use it it makes the best freaking juice.
