Before you panic about being perfect this semester, I'd **take a close look at the policies at your school: What does it really mean if you are on probation?** It's usually not meant to be a punishment but a combination of a way to get your attention and to give you some support for doing better, which you probably need. Yes, let the threat of probation motivate you to do better, but don't let it put you into panic mode where you might give up if you're not able to be perfect.

So go ahead and aim for  4.0, expect more like a 3.0, and do everything it takes to avoid getting below 2.0."

Sit down and talk with him at a neutral time. Tell him ""When you shower and do laundry on a regular basis, things are fine.

PS: The TV example should make it clear that you can't deduce age that way at all. There is no way to go from number of TVs bought to age in the population.

But this doesn't make sense either: 

> The average age of first childbirth for this group would be not when  100% have reproduced, but when 50% of them have: 13 years old. 

The average age of first childbirth is to take only the women who have given birth for the first time in that year, record their ages and calculate the average based on that. 

And if you wanted to know by what age 50% of women have reproduced: even assuming all women have given birth by age 26 (which is false) that doesn't mean half of them gave birth by age 13! I don't have the statistics, but I am entirely willing to assert that, no, 50% of 13 year olds have not given birth."
Professors,feiae5o,t3_ep8ffe,1579133885.0,"Some other considerations:

But even without those answers, I'd recommend not taking the position. In some disciplines, it'd be a great boost to your vita to take a full time college teaching position. But I don't see it as that much boosting your credentials. And it doesn't look bad that you are ""just"" teaching high school, since you are looking into teaching high school teachers yourself."

My suggestions to students writing the evaluations is to think about writing criticism that is actionable and useful. Write things that could actually be useful for the instructor to act on after they have read your comments. Keep in mind, too, that what seems obvious to you might not be clear. For example, ""instructor goes too fast"" could mean so many things: talks too fast, doesn't explain topics thoroughly enough, doesn't take time for questions, flips the PowerPoint slides too quickly, or the course topics go by quickly and you don't have time to keep up with the reading, or ? ? ?  

Most of the comments we get are, quite frankly, not very useful. To a large degree, that's not the student's fault but the way the surveys are set up."
