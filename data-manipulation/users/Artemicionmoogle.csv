relationships,fe60yq5,t1_fe5g1ub,1578879341.0,"The example provided, while a valid example of questioning someone about a *responsibility* is absolutely valid. It’s not relevant to what I was discussing. I can’t answer no to “why didn’t you pick up our children?” That’s absurd. And you’d have every right to demand an explanation.

This is a case of a distant acquaintance, at this point, who is expecting more than she is asking, while simultaneously attempting to guilt this person into agreeing to an undesirable situation. In this case, “No.” is a complete sentence, and is absolutely valid. She owes the bride no explanation(despite giving a perfectly acceptable reason), as the relationship is no longer close enough to warrant it."
