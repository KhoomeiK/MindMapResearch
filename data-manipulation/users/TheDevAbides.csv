depression,ffk3dq0,t3_eu0gi0,1580014567.0,"Yeah. I feel this too. I wish I could help.

I relatively like the workweek because I'm solving problems and staying busy.

I imagine that healthy people love weekends. Not me. For me weekends are the worst. All I have is myself and my demons.

And then the co-workers ask ""do anything fun this weekend?"". Ugh."
mac,ffj19v9,t3_etwgg0,1579987863.0,"The PC is going to be much better for your gaming & streaming. But a laptop is portable and you can take with you to see clients.

It looks like there is a need for both in your situation."
mac,ffiyg7t,t3_ete5zk,1579985808.0,"Your eyes are not deceiving you. The office suite does run better on Windows.

Many financial institutions (and/or finance departments) are Windows-based for this exact reason."
mac,ffixyrf,t3_etup4c,1579985459.0,"At the risk of getting chased out of here with pitchforks. The Surface laptop will serve you very well and I would't recommend the Air over it.

The surface will also have more processing cores (4) versus the Macbook air (2). For multi-tasking and productivity it will give you some more horsepower.

Ultimately -- you'll likely be happy with either, and you're fortunate to be choosing between two good options. They each have strengths and weaknesses.  Each in their own right are good machines.

Experience: I am currently typing this on a Macbook Pro which I've owned for years, as well as multiple Surface devices."
depression,fej4wmq,t3_epcsxm,1579157030.0,"I feel this too. I think the ideas are well-formed in my mind, but putting them to words is difficult.

I don’t know how to make it better."
depression,fe4wj1d,t3_enqkv8,1578863425.0,"Your husband says he needs time and space to deal with this. I can understand how that is challenging when you care a great deal for him. Please do provide this space, and also let him know that you'll be able to support him whenever he is ready. Also please understand this may actually be a great deal of time and space.

That being said, being in  the military and apprehensive to seek medical help does not help. If he is open to it perhaps start with therapy on his own. Maybe couples therapy later as he becomes more comfortable.

Anther thing to bear in mind -- if he does go to the doctor and they do determine a medical leave is necessary try to be open to the idea that it may be the best thing for him.

He is lucky to have you. Wising you both well."
depression,fe4h7ea,t3_enqkiy,1578859240.0,"Part of me wishes I could forget the ""good times"".

When those feelings come up it just further contrasts how terrible I feel now.

It is especially crushing."
depression,fe4g8jo,t3_enjjse,1578859005.0,"I'd like people to know that if a depressed person confides in you, that chances are very high they don't want you to ""fix"" anything. At least not right now.

I've done this on occasion and all I'm wanting in that moment is to be accepted, supported, and understood. When the person tries to ""fix"" me, the sentiment quickly shifts from the feeling of support to a feeling of judgement.

Statements like, ""Have you tried volunteering for those less fortunate?"", ""Have you tried exercise?"", ""What about...?"" 

Depending on delivery these statements and questions can easily be taken the wrong way. It might be coming from a loving place and with the intent to help. But it can also bring about frustration and shame in the depressed person.

Please assume that we're not inept and that we haven't tried to make ourselves better. We're sick. Please treat us similarly to how you would treat another sick person."
depression,fdyonay,t3_en98fa,1578782024.0,Same. I am 35.
lonely,fdmlyom,t3_em5ne5,1578554996.0,Yes. Words are hard and people are garbage.
comingout,fdj1gbz,t3_eli6ki,1578455999.0,"Hey. Just an idea here, take it or leave it. With the co-workers maybe the idea of “coming out” may not be totally necessary.

Perhaps in casual conversation you could bring up a story about your partner — “my boyfriend/girlfriend and I had a great weekend...”

Or perhaps it may never come up. You get to decide what you reveal and when."
Surface,fcw54fz,t3_ej7sir,1578017367.0,I have the Surface dock and it works really well for me. I would recommend.
depression,fcs8hp6,t3_eikk9a,1577912933.0,"Yeah, I can relate. I struggle to have a meaningful reason to endure.

People constantly tell us that it will ""get better"" and to just ""hold on"", which is irritating. Yeah, things may get better for a time, but for us afflicted with this disease we just end back in the same hopeless place.

I've been on this carousel ride long enough to know what's ahead of me and where I'll end up."
depression,fcs6k8r,t3_eieavt,1577912143.0,"The day itself is just the 365th day of the year. No big deal, and no more special than the others.

Although I do hate reflecting on the year and realizing it was another year of suffering. So instead I just drink to forget."
depression,fcl5d33,t3_ehmih0,1577740162.0,"With every life decision there is some benefit and some cost. Like many have already said, I too have lived with my parents as an adult.

In my case I was able to save some money and navigate a troubling health issue. The cost was my mental health and social life. I don't regret the decision, but I do regret not leaving sooner.

There's no right answer here. Just hoping whatever decision you make will be something that can help you be happier and healthier."
microsoft,fc0ppvd,t3_effg7a,1577296686.0,"I'm a big fan to the Google Pixel devices. Less software bloat, faster security updates, and longer support cycles are big deals for me.

The fact that they have excellent cameras is a bonus too."
