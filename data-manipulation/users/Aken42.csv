Wetshaving,ffjp1zy,t1_ffie94s,1580003393.0,"Night Music is a master piece in my opinion and it saddens me that you received such negative comments for something that was so personal. 

The first wetshaving order I ever made had a sample of night music in it. When I first smelled it I was blown away. Never having been a fragrance guy before, I didn't know scents like that existed. I spent quite some time tracking down a tub and did so again twice with the second run. To this day I will still open the tub and take a smell just because. 

For me, you, B&M and Night Music are a major reason why I got hooked on wetshaving and have since delved deeper into fragrances. 

I can completely empathize with why we will not see it again but I just wanted to say thank you for making it."
