So I really do wish you were right but it can definitely be done."
GhostRecon,fgsqhnz,t1_fgsp43k,1581090482.0,"Lol no I wasn’t. Never played those ones. Black watch was my first in the series then wildlands and BP. 
Thanks."
GhostRecon,fgsnwpl,t1_fgsacmr,1581088854.0,What game is it?
facepalm,fgsmniy,t1_fgsl2gp,1581088047.0,Yes Knives are measurably less of a threat than firearms however other things like improvised explosives and home made poisonous gas can be even more deadly than guns. Insanity finds a way.
reactiongifs,fg5py5k,t1_fg5jnvl,1580534695.0,Must just be my area then. I’ve never spoken to anyone who enjoys watching.  I guess that’s good to know though.
GhostRecon,fg4uvfs,t3_ewnr3p,1580511616.0,Looks like George Clooney a little lol.
reactiongifs,fg4umcy,t1_fg4i9rp,1580511458.0,I think most of us hate baseball now. We basically gave it to Japan.
AnimalsBeingBros,fftjnk7,t1_fftjbwe,1580222298.0,Considering the situation they were likely both working themselves too hard. But yeah ideally a break should have been taken.

facepalm,fejw7b1,t3_epha4j,1579187263.0,Most “reasonable” Americans (if you believe we exist) don’t really care either way other than we’ve already learned Deg.F.  METRIC VS IMPERIAL on the other hand anyone who uses tools sure as hell wishes we could just give it up and go to metric. No one wants to buy two sets of every tool because they are a quarter- half size off only to still find a cheap as dirt bolt/nut that conforms to no standard at all.
MxRMods,fegyr5h,t3_ep2v36,1579105509.0,Sorry noob here. Who’s MMG?
MxRMods,fe9c7v8,t1_fe6azqv,1578936271.0,Careful Junkin might license it then.
MxRMods,fdqzv1m,t1_fdqnycv,1578677607.0,Thank you for understanding! Your great!
MxRMods,fdqzaja,t3_empq5v,1578677266.0,Yeah good job posting it. Got to do whatever we can.
pokemon,fdn7zjw,t1_fdn7ojm,1578579753.0,Oh sweet. Thanks friend!  Must be it.
