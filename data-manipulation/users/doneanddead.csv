The second one isn't necessary at all but we learn and get used to it and it isn't that big of a deal. The development of writing systems is not necessarily logical. Logically speaking, everyone knows that the Japanese writing system today is a hodgepodge system that is probably not optimal for the language but it is entrenched and cultural at this point."

I've seen this more with Japanese historically but nowadays, people do it to Chinese as well -_- Like when people talk about the meaning of ""sensei"" or ""xiansheng"" and assign it some mystical ass meaning... like no, it just means teacher when we say it. When I hear the word, I don't think of some mystical meaning; I literally just think teacher."
