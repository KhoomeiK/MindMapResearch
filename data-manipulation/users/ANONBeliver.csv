AmItheAsshole,fdx1qyf,t3_en6jau,1578764414.0,"NAH From someone who graduated high school a few years back, I remember my mother impeding on my senior year festivities and it still makes me mad to think about it to this day. My mother was very religious and very strict and she would not let me go to parties or do anything with friends really for that matter. I remember the girl that I had a crush on in school asked me to come to the school bon fire and it was like a dream come true! I was so excited! And I got home and told my mom and she woulndt let me go.. Broke my heart. Anyways the next year I went to college and partied and did whatever and it was great. My point here is shes about to be out the house (hopefully) and I wouldn't ruin the last important year of school for her unless you want her holding it against you for the rest of forever. Plus shes about to be on her own and able to make her own decisions anyways. Senior year is important and bullying is a part if growing up honestly. Your either the bully or the bullied in this life and at leats shes on the other side of it. But it is wrong and she needs to have consequences but maybe not have her senior year ruined. Just an opinion

PublicFreakout,fcqdj8l,t1_fcoyrdi,1577883862.0,"I disagree with the statement about addicts are addicted to the feeling they get from the drug. At first yes but after time goes by its a constant battle to not get ""dope sick"". Opiate withdrawal is fantasticly horrible and once your tolerance is high enough the high pretty much goes away unless you do a shit-ton and your in a constant battle to keep from withdrawaling. Doing copious amounts of the drug and it just brings you back to baseline so you can function. After 2 years on it I began to hate the drug and I wanted off it so bad but I kept going because I was so scared of the withdrawal. I would have given up the drug in a heartbeat if it wasnt for the wds. Im 2 years clean now. Not trying to discredit you, just wanted to add that for anyone wondering.

Edit: I know people who are litteraly addicted to the act of shooting up and will actually just shoot water if they dont have dope. They become addicted to the needle itself, so theres alot more that goes into a drug addiction than just a good feeling."
