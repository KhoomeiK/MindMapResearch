Again, that didn't happen.  Check r/floridaman - the same exact story was posted at least twice.  It didn't blow up.  The threads are not wholly supportive of the spitter, but they also didn't turn into toxic shitholes.  Search for posts about Trump, there are plenty of posts in support of him throughout the subreddit where they don't devolve into stupid pissing matches.

That is what happened, they responded in shitty ways and tried to egg people on.  Not a single one of them is someone I recognize as a regular FloridaMan poster, they ain't from around here.

WatchRedditDie,feidzwq,t3_eov7h9,1579136300.0,"Just FYI, I found this post because I'm looking up other examples of recent drama for a write up.  You could have just sent us a modmail!

We blacklist tons and tons and tons of websites, almost all of them are personal blogs.  We also blacklist CNN, New York Times, Washington Post, The Independent (UK newspaper), The Mirror (UK newspaper), Google links, AMP project links, and a few others.  Local Fox affiliates are not blacklisted.

The reason is because for satire sites, some writers figured out that a cheap way to get clicks was to use Florida Man for their stories.  It would just drown out the legit content if we allowed it.

The reason for the newspaper websites is because they aren't really posting OC about the low-level events that are the best Florida Man material.  Google and the AMP project get around reddit's own repost filter.  Reposts are the #1 complaint in the subreddit, by far.

The reason it's all one filter is because I'm lazy and almost always browsing on mobile, and it's a PITA to edit Automod that way."

modsbeingdicks,fe3mjvc,t1_fe3lpf0,1578850648.0,"I only banned and muted you because you username mentioned me.  I don't care if you're posting here, braincels, or cuckold porn subreddits.  Sounds like you're the one that's triggered.  All I did was tell you idiots that you couldn't argue back in one thread and you're throwing a temper tantrum running on a day and a half long"
SubredditDrama,fe1vyty,t1_fe0c5fy,1578831546.0,"Oh sorry for mistaking you for one of them, you just post exactly the same way. See, there you go with 'you just locked it to post your political opinion'. Since when did it become political to acknowledge reality?  I didn't say anything about Trump's immigration policy, failed tax cuts, stupid trade wars, etc.  It's not about politics.  And I'm definitely the one being cringey, not all the chodes who've been whining and crying about not being able to post in one thread on r/FloridaMan all day."
SubredditDrama,fe1uapr,t1_fe0bt0z,1578830937.0,"No, none of them ever post there. They don't give a shit about the subreddit, they're just mad that someone told them they couldn't argue back one time."
SubredditDrama,fe0au4y,t1_fe0a7rs,1578808090.0,"Actually I locked a thread because I was working Friday afternoon and didn't feel like keeping an eye on it as it quickly became toxic.  Then, later, I deleted the comments because they were just all bad. There were people on both sides of the issue, everyone's comments were deleted.  Saying I did it to push an agenda is ignorant.  Then I realized, wow that's exactly what the brigaders would want.  None of these people post in the subreddit regularly.  If discussion just shuts down, they win.  In a subreddit about a superhero, you can't let the trolls take the day.  So I posted about Trump and how he's a failure, and I stickied it so you can't do anything about it.  This slight brush with feeling powerless triggered you all so bad you're still crying about it a day later.  Maybe that's something to think about."
SubredditDrama,fe09nn4,t1_fe09i8u,1578806996.0,"We have gained users over the last day, this whole event happened on an off time and won't even register with 99.99999% of subscribers.  The traffic stats for Friday aren't even out of normal.  The whole idiot horde isn't even a blip on the numbers."
SubredditDrama,fe08pv0,t3_enhauc,1578806150.0,">I have been banned and muted from /r/Floridaman, and the mod is in full force downvoting with alts.

This is so funny. I don't have any alts. You're just getting downvoted because outside of your stupid little echochamber, everyone thinks you people are dickheads. Like I said about Trump hats and white hoods."
SubredditDrama,fdzu8i6,t1_fdzu71b,1578795916.0,I am definitely not downvoting you.
NPR,fdzqxp4,t1_fds95zc,1578793758.0,"You see, someone accidentally stored it in the trashcan instead of the filing cabinet. They then accidentally burned the entire contents of the recycling. Accidents happen, what are ya some kind of conspiracy theorist?"
CRedit,fdzo0nx,t1_fdzmv07,1578792279.0,Looks like your total lack of achievement in life has gone to your head!  Might want to slow down there buddy.

AskReddit,fdzd9k3,t3_en86vd,1578789107.0,"**They Live!** is classic *so bad it's good* entertainment, but with a message at its core that is just as valid today as when it was produced.  Maybe even more today.  That is the true test of quality for art."
