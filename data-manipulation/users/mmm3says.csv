FanTheories,ff8eeva,t3_eruuku,1579674977.0,"I read about Time Lord biology, and it apparently well that ""Time Lords"" as a society, are known to be able to grant more than 12 regenerations.  The only legal way to do this is though an act of the High Council.  Personally attempting to get more or researching it is illegal.  There is no known limit to number of regenerations , although, like bad copies, letter regernations are said to become more and more mentally unstable.

They did so for Rassilon, the Master, and Dr Who.  The former two were like, dead dead when the council initiated new regenerations.   The doctor is on his 14th regeneration now and the cameo appearance by John Baker as the Curator a few years.

Further, the villain form the classic series known as the Valeyard was reportedly a version of the Doctor's darker side brought forth in a regeneration of the Doctor from sometime between his 12th and Final regenerations; and may have been deliberately produced by the High Council. (Remember in the regeneration to the war doctor there were some able to manipulate Regeneraton into the type of person chosen male or female, etc.  He chose Warrior.)

&#x200B;

Regeneration came from exposure to the Time Rift itself, which is the origin of the Time Lords.  As such I think it and and regeneration may be involved in some way.  Now, we know those children chosen to become true Time Lords are but a small fraction of the population of Gallifrey.  All time lords are exposed as children to the Untempered Schism.

What if this is what activates their ability to regenerate.  If it does so, perhaps there is a price.  Say, that every time a Time Lords regenerates one, or ten, or a hundred, or a thousand normal galiffreyans die a sudden an untimely death or are unnaturally aged.  Their life forces sucked up to fuel the undying tyranny of night immortal, supremely powerful Time Lords.   Every Time Lord that had ever reintegrated would, in a way and even if unknowingly, be a mass murderer.

Now if I was the Master and learned that I might be lie ""ALL of you life-sucking bastards need to die now for this.""   I'd be mad if I knew someone killed a busload of kindergarteners to save my piddly ass.

I know, it suffers the flaw of the Master being a ruthless killer anyway.  But he is obsessed with control.  And being made to kill many with no say in the matter may strike him hard enough to snap his always fragile psyche.

Oops - so ""The Timeless Child"" may be a Gallifreyan trapped permanently in a child state and revered as having something to do with the origin of the time lords.  The dark secret being the child is the focus of the temporal bio-regenerative matrix.  The lynchpin though which the lives and years drained for their regenerations pass from the common people to the Time Lords.  Then trying to stop more death and stopping more regenerations from being granted means killing an innocent child.  That's the kind of A-hole move we've come to expect from them."

The comics are the only medium they really have for introducing completely new characters,  I wish they would put some of the figures out.    I don't think they have a toon out and Bumbleverse as a thing independent from bayverse is in its infancy.

Bayverse is pretty much closed,  and they are cycling repeats.  The Devastator figure, while I am not getting out, is breaking new ground.  But notice none of the components have any character development.  Other than establishing he has a scrotum (Thanks Bay, we wondered /s )

Hasbro has a vast amount of intellectual property to draw on.  Figures like the Battle Masters haven't seen light of day since their original releases \~30ish years ago.

There are some new characters - like Pteraxadon, Dazzlestrike. But without a media to introduce and push them any new big guys are basically a gamble.   imagine pitching a big new character to your boss  ""Oh look its Trithrunderquirk for $49.99, what's his story? nobody has any fricking idea, but we hope fans will buy it just because we out it on the shelf.""

To introduce new characters in  they'd need  to put out a show ahead of the toys and get it cable rather than just a streaming service.    They could introduce many new characters and put out toys for the fans' favorite.
