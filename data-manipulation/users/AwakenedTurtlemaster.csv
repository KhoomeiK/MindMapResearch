Take off your glasses. What do you see? Nothing? That's what the government wants.

Birds are little government drones that shine lazers into your eyes so you have bad vision. They then sell you your vision back as glasses, *which make the Earth look round!*

Also, computers were invented by the government to damage your vision even more.

Don't trust birds, the government and computers. /s"
