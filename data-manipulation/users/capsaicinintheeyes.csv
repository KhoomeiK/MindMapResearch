Or: they're 12--*that's* why I bring that up.  I think it's worth noting both that the passerbyes caught on camera don't look overly concerned by his actions, and the the initial 911 caller relayed that they both thought he was probably a juvenile, and that the gun was likely fake.  I'm aware this wasn't relayed to the officers, but it does look like others observing this scene weren't necessarily viewing it with the same level of alarm.

>drive up right by him and yell to put his hands up 3 times

Do we have *corroboration* that they said that, or are the officers *claiming* that they said that?  Because maybe our next subject can be instances when police give a coordinated account of their actions that depicts them behaving according to protocol, only to have it flatly contradicted by later release of footage.  Regardless, given the timespan involved, I'm not sure it matters (as well, when I mentioned that he may not have had time to register that it was police roaring at him, that was thrown in on my part largely for color--[this is not enough time](drive up right by him and yell to put his hands up 3 times) to do anything before being shot.  

I have no idea what the purpose was behind the movement of his arm--I'll give a good change it was reflexive/involuntary.  Others have suggested he wanted to show the police that it was harmless (again, I'm not even sure he'd have had time to think that through.  And again: he's 12.)  One thing we probably can guess, however, is that gunning down two officers with an airsoft pellet gun was probably the least likely intent of all.  So clearly, whatever his motive, even if unconscious and triggered by pure surprise, there are things that will cause a person to do that in a split second that don't involve opening fire on cops.

The split-second judgment to fire would be more supportable if they hadn't put themselves in the position they were in; this would never have happened if taken stock of the situation like any reasonable person would, and like it appears everyone else involved in this episode did.  There's all this shit you don't know.  You* had plenty of time to take the situation in, rather than guns out being your first step.  

*(=the officers, not you, Bottsatsleep)

>the officers didn’t shoot because a potential risk was too close

This may not have been in the actual wording of the findings, but it's intimately tied to the ""imminent fear for life"" defense, and was very much a topic of debate while this was ongoing.  That situation happened because they took the ultra-aggressive approach they did, when other options existed (and again, I don't think this is Monday morning quarterbacking here: a reasonable person would have first thought to call for backup and a perimeter at the time).

Speaking of reasonableness, on top of mistaking a 12 year old for a man of 20 and, might [this say something](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Tamir_Rice#Police_officers_involved) about their possible state of mind?  The driver, Garmback's, past excessive force use sounds terrible to the untrained eye, but to be honest?  I'm so close to assuming it's typical for any officer to have at least one of these incidents on their record after a few years that it hardly even registers.  But *look at the shooter, Loehmann*:

>Loehmann, the officer who fired the shots that killed Rice, joined Cleveland's police force in March 2014. In 2012, he had spent five months with the police department in Independence, about 13 miles (21 km) south of Cleveland, with four of those months spent in the police academy.

>In a memo to Independence's human resources manager, released by the city in the aftermath of the shooting, Independence deputy police chief Jim Polak wrote that Loehmann had resigned rather than face certain termination due to concerns that he lacked the emotional stability to be a police officer. Polak said that Loehmann was **unable to follow ""basic functions as instructed""** and specifically cited a **""dangerous loss of composure"" that occurred in a weapons training exercise**. Polak said that **Loehmann's weapons handling was ""dismal""** and he became visibly ""distracted and weepy"" as a result of relationship problems. The memo concluded, ""Individually, these events would not be considered major situations, but when taken together they show **a pattern of a lack of maturity, indiscretion and not following instructions, I do not believe time, nor training, will be able to change or correct these deficiencies.""** It was subsequently revealed that Cleveland police officials never reviewed Loehmann's personnel file from Independence prior to hiring him.[21][39] He had been hired in Cleveland despite listing his primary source of income for the prior six months having been derived from ""under-the-table jobs.""[40]

>On May 30, 2017, the mayor of Cleveland announced that Loehmann had been fired for concealing details about his past employment in his job application. On his application, Loehmann said that he had left the Independence Police Department for ""personal reasons"" and did not reveal the Independence police's determination that he had ""an inability to emotionally function"" as an officer.

Taken all this together, what do you think the appropriate reaction should be?  The city of Cleveland did hand over $6,000,000 out of the city's general fund, and while I certainly don't have a problem with the figure or the settlement itself, these settlements that are essentially paid directly by the taxpayers, rather than in any way being targeted at the police department, let alone the individuals involved, don't have a great track record of triggering big overhauls.  For those of us concerned with accountability going where it needs to, here's what we got: Loehmann ends up fired, *not* for anything about this shooting, but for being found to have omitted facts about his employment in Providence on his resume...and the dispatcher was suspended for 8 days.  If you believe that there's any sort of value in setting examples when someone's incompetence, recklessness and negligence lead to someone's death, then, I hope you can see why I'm worried that none of this is gonna mean a thing at all."
TopMindsOfReddit,ffjh8gt,t1_ffjelad,1579998179.0,"That's a really interesting point.  Like with the McCarthy witchhunts (or the witchhunt-witchhunts, for that matter), the ambiguity of the evidence allows you to level it at almost anyone, thus making it much more enduring )and endearing) for those who employ those tactics."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,ffizwub,t1_ff7c8ko,1579986871.0,"All right: long-delayed, but finally got my shit together!  First, just to tie up the Scott thing:  I'm not sure the video's clear enough to say that he *did* do anything wrong.  I was lamenting that that was the last we heard about it.  At the time, people were saying that looked awfully like him picking up his taser that he dropped and planting it by Scott, before reconsidering, but the video's just not clear enough to say for sure, and it just seemed to have fallen off people's radar after the initial couple cycles.  It'd be nice to have gotten an official account of that series of actions to put up against the taser theory, is where I'm at.

On to Rice:  

You sounded like you're already familiar with this case, so I'm not gonna spend a lot of time rehashing the whole chain of events, unless you think there's something we should go over.  Suffice to say that while some human error can be understood purely as an unfortunate mistake, we have crimes like ""negligent homicide"" and ""involuntary manslaughter"" for a reason: eventually, the scope of someone's fuck-up exceeds any ""reasonable person"" standard, and their incompetence should no longer be seen a a shield against guilt.

For me, that line was crossed in the case of Rice (who, I just can't help but repeat for the record, was 12 years old) when the two responding officers chose the tactic of driving up alongside him as quickly as possible, then immediately opening fire (re-watch the video, if you need to: he may not have even have had time to register that it was a police car in front of him before he was shot), and used, as a defense, that they had to open fire when they did, because they were *too close to the potential gunman to risk anything else*.  To me, that's not far off from spontaneously tossing a handgun to someone while saying, ""catch,"" and then shooting them when their hands instinctively close around the incoming object.  Yes, you are now faced with someone potentially armed and dangerous up close next to you, but only because you consciously created that situation.  The other party was placed there, by you, with no input on their part whatsoever.  Fuck.  No.  You cannot at that point use the ""I feared for my life"" defense.

Except, of course you can, if you're a police officer, because those two didn't even make it past the grand jury.  They had plenty of options; they hadn't even ascertained if it was a real gun or not, nor his open-carry status (giving them the benefit of the doubt by assuming they thought he was older than 12).  You don't need to be a tactical genius to say that a reasonable person would have called for backup and set up a perimeter, communicating to him with a bullhorn.  There wasn't any need for that kind of immediate no-prisoners rush."
