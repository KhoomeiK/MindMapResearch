I don't blame the immigrant or the employers.  They are both trying to better their position in life which is the human condition. The role of society is to limit this force with proper laws and policies if it is harmful to it's citizens.  Which is why I blame people like you who are against proper laws and policies because you couldn't care less about the people in the US that may not have the skills you have but still need a job.  You would rather replace them with foreign people because it feels sooo good to prove you are super not racist and woke.  To hell with what happens to Americans- they don't matter anymore because you decided that it's much cooler to throw them away and support poor Mexicans. 

When I worked in real estate I watched whole crews of construction workers of all races being replaced by illegal immigrants.  These people had worked in their trades for years, sometimes decades.  All the while people like you shit on them by saying illegal immigrants take jobs Americans don't want. That's a lie. They wanted and still want those jobs.  They are jobs people like you and other piece of shit fake liberals don't want because you look down on manual labor and the working class.

The other lie people like you and the corporate media like to tell is that they only work in agriculture.  [This is not true, the majority work in construction](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/pew-72-of-illegals-have-jobs-biggest-in-construction).  They also bust factories all the time for illegal workers.

Just to go carbon free on energy production the state of california would have to spend trillions of dollars to replace their plants.  This is one freaking state in one country. This is not to mention the factories, the cars and everything that emit CO2.  And when you replace the cars with electric cars you advance climate change because the mining and production of everything emits a massive amount of CO2.

JordanPeterson,feh4pth,t1_feh2x3i,1579109098.0,"> Close. While this is an attack on the man, the ad homenim fallacy is used to attempt to counter an argument. I counter no argument.

But you are countering an argument: my original argument of who cares if he selectively edits a video.  And you are making an argument too- you shouldn't pay attention to him at all because of his past.  It is a logical fallacy.  

While this Bernie video isn't worth anything IMO, he is getting people leaking information through his organization from Google and other companies that I would be interested in.  But your irrational stance is to not pay attention to anything he puts out.  And it is both irrational and self serving due to your political point of view.

I have several sources that I can't stand but still would be willing to listen if they put out evidence on something important.

Like I said, you are blinded by your bias to what is rational and irrational."

And your government stats on immigration that you linked are disputed, and rightly so.  Their data comes from a self reported government survey from people who in general are *hiding from the government.*  Their motivation to self report to the US government that they are in the country illegally is not very high.

MIT and Yale did a study which looked at actual data instead of an inaccurate survey and [doubled the estimate of illegal immigrants in the country](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-21/mit-yale-study-doubles-estimates-of-u-s-undocumented-immigrants)

Personally I watched entire crews of workers in construction being replaced by illegal immigrants by the way.  All the while the country shit on them by saying they were racist.  Then South Park making fun of them with the ""they took r jobs.""  The leftist media just said the immigrants were taking jobs no one else wants to do.  It's a lie.  [Most illegal immigrants work in construction](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/pew-72-of-illegals-have-jobs-biggest-in-construction).  A lot of men want to work in construction and its a respectable job."

It doesn't matter if he is a serial killer, facts don't care about the source.  If a serial killer who has lied in the past reports another serial killer to the cops, and has evidence most good cops are at least going to look into it.  You hate the source and won't even look because you have a bias.
