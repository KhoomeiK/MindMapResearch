changemyview,ff3uxuv,t1_ff2yauj,1579549403.0,"> Androgen insensitivity syndrome and gender dysphoria are two different things.  

I think there's the possibility of a very interesting link between the two.  

People with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) have a genetic quirk where their cells don't respond to the masculinizing effects of androgens.  Their bodies make it, but it doesn't have any effect on them - to the point where everyone, including their physicians, thought they had XX sex chromosomes until their teenage years at least.  

From what I've read of the condition it's very unusual for a woman with CAIS to identify as anything other than a cis woman.  Furthermore, it's even unusual for a woman with CAIS to identify as anything other than a *straight* cis woman.  Not unheard of, mind you, but even rarer than usually found in the general population.  

There's a theory that this is due to a woman with CAIS' resistance to masculinizing effects of hormones extending to their neurological development as well.  The variations of pre-natal hormone exposure that can cause someone to develop as transgender or even exclusively homosexual don't affect a woman with CAIS's development at all.  So you have someone with XY sex chromosomes but zero masculinizing effects, and it is reflected in their neurological development."

I think there's the possibility of a very interesting link between the two.  

People with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) have a genetic quirk where their cells don't respond to the masculinizing effects of androgens.  Their bodies make it, but it doesn't have any effect on them - to the point where everyone, including their physicians, thought they had XX sex chromosomes until their teenage years at least.  

From what I've read of the condition it's very unusual for a woman with CAIS to identify as anything other than a cis woman.  Furthermore, it's even unusual for a woman with CAIS to identify as anything other than a *straight* cis woman.  Not unheard of, mind you, but even rarer than usually found in the general population.  

There's a theory that this is due to a woman with CAIS' resistance to masculinizing effects of hormones extending to their neurological development as well.  The variations of pre-natal hormone exposure that can cause someone to develop as transgender or even exclusively homosexual don't affect a woman with CAIS's development at all.  So you have someone with XY sex chromosomes but zero masculinizing effects, and it is reflected in their neurological development."
