Edit: since some of you seem to like this, let me tell you how one could easily get accused:

Someone has your email as their backup and has used your network at any time to login in the passed. You now have to fork over thousands to prove it's not you. No MAC addresses are provided for some idiotic reason. Google will also provide you with zero help in this and only will you be able to get a copy of what they handed over after you've been formally charged for a crime."
