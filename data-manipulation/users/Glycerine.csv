Are you going to release this as a game? Can I play it now?! Do you need money? Can I play it now?"
WinStupidPrizes,ffaj7bc,t1_ff1yton,1579737053.0,"I was in RLC support attached to a company of real crazy Navy/Squady types (I can't remember who exactly.. American anyway). Whilst serving in Iraq (Circa 2008) I was still new into the job and we had to do house to house EID search. we found a VBIED (car explosive) All wired up and looked ready to blow.

In the blazing mid morning heat we watched a guy (NCO in full gear) carefully pick at the wires in this car. After about 40 minutes of quiet clicks and scrapping we were getting restless and considered just blowing the entire thing.

At that moment the disposal guy - half inside the car, half hanging out the left side door - let out a almighty scream and just start ripping wires from inside the car and kicking around. We all freaked! And dove for cover thinking he fucked up and we're already dead.

After a few seconds of a silent stillness we peered out from our hiding places to find the disposal guy standing over the car - eyes popping and sweaty. 

He had just spent an hour carefully unpicking the rarely seen - cassette and radio player."

The guy in the shop is sound though and only charges the flat fee he's billed for charge cards which is 50p."
