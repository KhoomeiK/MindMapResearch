MMA,fgzj0r7,t1_fgzf4b4,1581194625.0,"I feel like looking up to Jon as a fighter would have pros and cons. On one hand, he has amazing technique and variety, but on the other hand he’s built in such a unique way that nobody can really recreate what he does. If other fighters tried to fight like Jon they just wouldn’t be able to."
MMA,fgzitox,t1_fgzahox,1581194557.0,You’re on a sub where people say it’s irrational to judge Jon for the hit and run because he hasn’t done it since. People will excuse anything he does.
MMA,fgzinab,t1_fgzdwf8,1581194491.0,"Funny how he doesn’t really look older when he’s completely bald like the DC rematch, but when he keeps the hair he looks old"
MMA,fgzii76,t1_fgzfvsr,1581194443.0,Yes
MMA,fgzifzf,t1_fgzgktu,1581194422.0,I bet it online for him. He’s parlaying Shev and Reyes.
MMA,fgypsvv,t1_fgyl2c2,1581185663.0,"My stepdad’s got Valentina + Reyes, $175 bet for a $773 return"
MMA,fgyntlv,t1_fgyncyd,1581185168.0,"Nobody said the fights are gonna suck, we’re just saying it’s a shit card. Believe it or not, people can like or dislike things for different reasons than you do. And you complaining about people complaining is ridiculously hypocritical."
MMA,fgyn85i,t1_fgyidop,1581184972.0,"McGregor vs Diaz, Stipe vs Ngannou, Cormier vs Anyone"
MMA,fgym27h,t1_fgyl4kx,1581184699.0,"You know you’re never gonna get praised for this right? There will never come a day where you log onto this sub and everyone is commenting “that u/dropthabears is so sick man. In a world full of casuals and WWE fans, he was a *real* MMA fan. He watched all the fight pass prelims and *never* complained. He found every boring wrestlefuck entertaining. God, I wish I could be as enlightened as him.”

That will not happen. Stop looking for attention and just watch the damn fights."
MMA,fgykfi6,t1_fgyjana,1581184199.0,"> How do you know the card is shitty if it hasnt started yet

Because a lot of the appeal of MMA for many people is anticipating fights where you actually know the people fighting, and can make predictions and have storylines to follow going into it. Fights that people can look forward to. 

> And why bother complaining about it?

Because we’re on an internet forum created for the sole purpose of discussing and sharing our opinions on MMA. Why bother complaining about people complaining?"
MMA,fgyk2yd,t1_fgyi4aa,1581184082.0,"Yeah that’s true, people will always want validation from others. But I don’t think that’s inherently bad if it’s not taken too far. Also where I live, they don’t show how many likes your posts get anymore, to encourage people to post whatever they want."
MMA,fgyh0yf,t1_fgyfjl1,1581183340.0,"Some people are fake and vain, and that will show on their social media. But social media is not inherently fake or vain, it’s just a platform to share images and videos and talk to people."
MMA,fgyfe99,t1_fgy28l0,1581182806.0,People like you will look at a fight like Austin Lingo vs Youseff Zalal and pretend to know who the fighters are and pretend you’re excited to impress strangers on an internet forum
MMA,fgyf1ui,t1_fgyefns,1581182686.0,There was a lot of backlash against Stephen A so there’s inevitably gonna be some backlash against the backlash.
MMA,fgyecxd,t3_f0abnr,1581182461.0,"It amazes me how the mind of a casual works sometimes. My stepdad just called me saying he’s betting $175 on Reyes cause “he’s so much bigger than Jon.” I said they’re roughly the same size. He said “no way, I just saw the weigh in, he’s at least a foot taller.”"
MMA,fgydtd7,t1_fgybao6,1581182277.0,"I need Fight Pass unfortunately since we don’t have ESPN+ in Canada. Most of the time I can’t legally watch the prelims at all, it’s pretty ridiculous"
MMA,fgyddiw,t1_fgybygt,1581182133.0,"> If so, where does she get it done?

Houston"
MMA,fgy8xfg,t1_fgy7f3a,1581180747.0,Oh fuck I got memed on hard...
MMA,fgy6xb5,t1_fgy1mfd,1581180092.0,I think the whole “instagram is fake and vain” narrative is made by people that just don’t like being social that much or don’t have anything to post. You can choose not to use instagram without constantly acting like you’re better than people who do
PublicFreakout,fgxf852,t1_fgxb10u,1581172197.0,I don’t think he’s asking for help I think he’s just a degenerate. Glad he ruined his life.
PublicFreakout,fgxf5hb,t1_fgx4ia2,1581172166.0,Watch the video?
PublicFreakout,fgxf45y,t1_fgwm6hs,1581172151.0,He can legally say it outside of class but that doesn’t mean he’s not gonna face consequences
MMA,fgxboi8,t1_fgxaot1,1581171106.0,And considering Zabit is a much more well rounded and just overall better fighter than Ortega
MMA,fgwthmq,t1_fgux8fv,1581165694.0,"Most people don’t get sides and if you do, they go away when you stop taking it."
MMA,fgwtexm,t1_fgux8i7,1581165661.0,"There’s no risk of chemical castration lol. That’s never been proven. It can have side effects, but they go away when you stop taking it."
MMA,fguiukt,t1_fguioa4,1581121894.0,"My bad https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/f07s2o/image_never_forget_who_was_there_with_you_from/fgt8n61/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

MMA,fguebqp,t1_fgudf01,1581118721.0,Yes it completely stops balding for 90+% of people. Look it up
MMA,fgudcko,t1_fgud7k5,1581118054.0,Take finasteride
MMA,fgud3i2,t3_f0abnr,1581117883.0,You guys see Izzy call Jones a roidhead and say “fuck that cunt”? Their trash talk is really heating up
MMA,fgucz5z,t1_fgt5fgm,1581117805.0,"I agree. Check out this exchange though https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/f07s2o/image_never_forget_who_was_there_with_you_from/fgu7m4b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

So ridiculous"
GetMotivated,fgu2hxw,t1_fgtn1rw,1581112483.0,"They’re not though, I just explained why."
MMA,fgte999,t1_fgtd9ng,1581103253.0,Pretty much but he was also expected to roll through his last opponent and almost lost
MMA,fgtdtln,t1_fgtcffs,1581103090.0,Now I know how long I must wait
GetMotivated,fgt9cvb,t1_fgt8n61,1581101249.0,"The burden of proof is always on the one making the accusation and there is no proof. If I say “Eminem is a serial killer” and offer no proof, I can’t then say “well prove that he *isn’t* a serial killer” and act like it’s validating my point."
MMA,fgt6d2o,t1_fgt65ej,1581099983.0,I’ve seen him do that several times. He comes across as very self centred. Type of guy who won’t even shoot a little air through his nose when his nephew makes a joke if he doesn’t actually find it funny.
