ShitMomGroupsSay,ffag272,t3_esixh0,1579734911.0,"Interesting. I have a feeling they mean stop using pull-ups or training briefs, instead of keeping the kids in dirty underwear all day. The reason being is kids will just continue to deal with the mild dampness of peeing in pull-ups because they’re essentially diapers. Same with training underwear, except those are less absorbent than pull-ups and so might cause some discomfort."
Scotland,ff6ory1,t1_ff6npzz,1579631734.0,"Edinburgh first, then drove up to Inverness for a few days and explored around there. We flew out of Glasgow so took our time driving down with lots of stops for pictures. We really want to go back and stay at the Kingshouse Hotel near Glencoe and go hiking, and get over to the Isle of Harris. 

It’s so gorgeous. I’ve wanted to see the Scottish Highlands since I was a kid and I absolutely fell in love with the area this trip. We were there in October, and now I want to go back enough times to see it all four seasons of the year (maybe we’ll just have to move there)!"

Noom,fdf4iua,t1_fdf36i5,1578353130.0,Afaik the goal is long term change instead of a quick fix. At the speed I’ve set for my weight loss I’m allowed about 1550 calories per day before exercise. I’ve lost about 10lbs (~5kg?) since the beginning of November and that’s even with my eating going completely off the rails over the holidays. It’s not for everyone but all the articles talking about how to approach food seem to be helping me. :)
Noom,fdezjcc,t1_fd6llgz,1578349944.0,Yes! I don’t have much in common with diabetic 60 year olds with mobility issues. It would be nice to be chatting with people who exercise as much as me and just struggle with the food side.

There’s a bunch of short articles and stuff to help me realize how to eat healthier, even when I also sometimes just have to have a cookie."
Noom,fdex14o,t1_fddt4f9,1578348388.0,This. I like the extra reading and checking in with the group/coach for support. But if I was just calorie counting I wouldn’t be paying for this service!
Noom,fdewwnc,t1_fdepebd,1578348309.0,"I’m not trying to convince you to stay, not everyone works the same way. But I did mention the 1200 calories is ridiculous to my coach person and they pointed out I can change how fast I want to lose weight under settings and that changes my daily calorie limit. And when I log exercise I get more calories to play with."
