tifu,ff8cb6j,t1_ff7oyhq,1579672705.0,"I grew up in a loving, but very strict catholic household. Mass twice a week. Prayers constantly etc. hey, my parents even met in a cult. My dad grew, my mom did not. They stayed together until I was 18 to avoid custody issues and it sucked. They didn’t fight in front of me, the just didn’t speak. They spent my college fund on getting a divorce. It was extremely difficult as a teen to witness it all. Since the divorce my dad is happily remarried and my mom is slowly and painfully removing the stick from her ass. Your kids know and they want you to be happy. They’re little, but they still want you to be happy."

research,fewlbol,t3_eqqzrb,1579413463.0,"Did they tell you specifically what medical conditions made you exempt from the study or did they just tell you that you were exempt? I’ve done many different studies and a lot goes into screening people. Some studies we’ve done are on sensitive topics and we might not feel a person is mentally capable for it. For instance, I would never approach somebody about a study if I didn’t feel like it was appropriate for their mental health. Your weight, age, gender, and other demographic criteria can also deem you exempt from a study. Protocol is rigorous for excepting people into a study. Human subjects  research has very detailed and particular guidelines you have to follow. It’s much better to exempt someone from a study than to allow them to partake only to find out later it was a bad call. That jeopardizes the study more than anything.

If you truly think something was wrong, then I would call the institution they work for and ask to speak to the institution review board about it. If they’re doing research without an IRB approval then you should thank your lucky stars that you weren’t asked to participate

I was running some dna and it was a match to someone and then I said “we got the guy!” And I ran out. Then I woke up. I have no clue who it is or what the case is at this point. 

The next time I followed him into an orgy/night club and that was wild. I was on his tail, but he got away. I decided to go undercover and I ended up falling in love with his cousin. I woke up. As far as IRL me is concerned I’m still with his cousin. 

Last night, I was on a run and ran through someone’s yard because I saw something weird. I ran in and he came up behind me and drugged me. I “woke up” in a car in Brazil with a needle in my arm. Then IRL me woke up. 

We’re starting this story in the middle. I have no clue who the killer is or who he killed. I do know he’s 5’8-5’11. He always wears a black zip up hoodie. Obviously I’m in Brazil because he wanted to get rid of me. Idk why he didn’t kill me though.

HarleyDilly,fep6r6o,t1_felx31u,1579313394.0,"Hey! So to add to what you’re saying...I study specifically prenatal grief. It’s really easy to assume “this is the proper way” to grieve etc etc. before I really got into it I thought the same thing. However, losing a child is the single most difficult thing that a parent will go through, and I firmly believe that. I am not a parent myself, but as someone that has interviewed and researched hundreds of bereaved parents, her phrasing and things are very “normal”. However, there is no reported “normal” way to grieve. No validated scale. I like to think...imagine the angriest you’ve ever been and imagine someone transcribing the rant you made. It wouldn’t make any sense! I know mine wouldn’t! In addition to that, psychologically speaking the Kübler-Ross stages of grief have been recently scrutinized.  First, they are not linear like a lot of people think (Kübler-Ross says this himself). Researchers have also discussed that this isn’t really reflective of how people really grieve. Im not trying to criticize or anything, but I just hope people keep in mind that this is a mother and no matter what she’s hurting. It’s important to remember that and sympathize with that first and foremost. Speculation can come after we understand that."

psychologystudents,feji9zw,t3_ephnsi,1579175462.0,"Assuming youre in the US, the only online PhD program I know of is university of the cumberlands. However, I’m not sure if they’re APA accredited. If you want a PhD so you can do research your best bet is an in-person program because they will pay tuition and give you a stipend. That being said, if research isn’t your thing then a PsyD might be more up your alley. That’s not to say that someone with a PsyD can’t do research! I know plenty that do. It’s just the program isn’t research focused like a PhD is. I’m currently getting my masters (MS) online at Tiffin University and I really like the program.
