AskReddit,ff0fgdd,t1_ff0bj0a,1579468363.0,"Honestly idk if it ever stops. I suppose it depends on the person and how bad the trauma is. Even with Therapy it'll take a lot. Personally, it's been a few years and I suppose it's gotten better but that's mostly because i avoid triggers. But well, who knows, i still have most of my life in front of me. Maybe someday it'll pass completely.

I do hope it gets easier for you at some point, hopefully a lot easier."
