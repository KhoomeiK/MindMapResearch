troubledteens,ff7xx1k,t3_es00xa,1579660985.0,"As a parent with a troubled teen, I looked into gooning. All sorts of medical intervention and counseling have helped slightly but it's not great.   He simply won't listen to anything.  At this point, I'm hoping he works things out as he matures.  And failing out of school is better than the damage from one of these programs.   However if it comes to the safety of my other children or wife, or even pets, or significant property damage, then there *has* to be a point where a violent teen cannot stay at home.  It would be a horrible decision, but unavoidable.  
If you don't want to be sent away, do not act violent in any way.  Apologize for previous incidents to make it clear that you know what was wrong so you won't be that way again.  If you can't control yourself, seek medical help."

Sort of like 3d space is flapping around like a 2D sheet in the wind, and when two parts touch, they interact.
