You have to remember that a physics degree is more like an English degree than an Engineering one. While Engineering clearly leads to a specific job (being an engineer of some kind), English can lead into a very wide range of jobs and the most obvious one (an English professor) is neither common nor lucrative. Physics is like that: few people go on to get a PhD and enter physics academia, even if quite a few wish they could and try very hard at it. 

Instead, most people end up going into CS, data science, or engineering, but there's a wide spread. The AIP gives [a lot of great data](https://www.aip.org/statistics/employment/bachelors) on employment statistics for all levels. 

But none of these jobs are going to land in your lap. There will be a lot of others applying to the same jobs with a more relevant degree and years of relevant experience, and if you want to work in a field that is not physics (which you must do) then you need to get some of that relevant experience. You can't get a job in CS if you have no experience programming and no portfolio of work to show for it. There's a lot of freedom to pick a job in physics but you do need to take responsibility for working towards that job. The degree doesn't really mean a whole lot, just like how an English degree alone isn't going to help you run a business. So you need to decide what you want to do and start specialising. Don't just trudge on through, get your degree, and then start wondering where you'll work. You have to start now."
college,few2ooy,t1_feucx6f,1579404630.0,"If the rules are clearly stated, people will get pissed when you fail to follow them.

I had a paper nearly be rejected from a publisher once because I wrote ""universe"" with a lower-case ""u"" when their style rules required it be capitalised. But those *are* the rules and it was my fault for not reading the 10 page style-guide more carefully. 

I think an actual Christian (having been raised one myself) would intrinsically know to capitalise words like ""God"" because they would have seen them written out, and have written them out themselves, many times over. Hell, even if they're just following the guidance of the Bible they know. We knew to capitalise those words at 5 years old."
GradSchool,fevzx6d,t3_eqozcp,1579403569.0,"The only thing they care about is **evidence that you can do a PhD successfully**. There's lots of things that they take into account when assessing that (in no particular order because it varies by program)

 - GPA: A high relevant GPA generally means you have a good theoretical grounding in the area, which is good. You can't utilise knowledge that you don't have. A low GPA isn't proof that you know ~nothing, but it's a distinct lack of proof that you know the theory well. People in that group have to find another way to prove their background knowledge.

 - Standardised test scores: Some programs weight these more highly than others. They don't correlate with success in a PhD program beyond graduate coursework, but they're at least standardised, which GPA isn't. Really high scores aren't likely to impress anyone. Really low scores are a serious red flag. 

 - Research experience: This is the most direct way to show that you can do research -- by having done it before. Publications come under this. They're not required and involve an element of luck, but you need to publish as a PhD so having proven experience in that too is always a plus. If you don't have publications, they won't assume you're incapable of them. 

 - LoRs: Equal first with research experience. You can do great research and publish 57 journal papers, but if your letter writers say you're a total ass who's impossible to work with, you're not getting in. People skills are very important and people need to like you and believe in you. A good letter can really smooth over a lot of problems in an application and a negative letter may be reason alone to trash your application, no matter your other achievements. So stop worrying about cultivating XYZ numbers in your applications, cultivate *relationships* and *connections* because they will be your ticket. 

 - Non-relevant work experience: Working as a bag-boy for 5 years might show some level of work ethic, but again, it's a lack of evidence that you can do the kind of work needed for a *PhD*. Some programs take class issues into account better than others, so spending your time on non-relevant work will harm you to different degrees."
college,fevxiuf,t3_eqpk6u,1579402756.0,"The only important thing is that you take notes that work well *for you*. Don't use a method that has a name. 

Think about what you need your notes to do for you. Are your lectures recorded? Are the notes posted online? Are you following along in a textbook? In all of these cases, a lot of the general stuff is going to be accessible in better detail somewhere else that isn't your notes. So in those cases, your notes should focus more on recording extra details you can't get elsewhere, like worked examples, answers to student questions, and any asides. 

If you have no textbooks, no online notes, no recordings, etc then your notes need to be a complete transcript of the lectures -- define a shorthand that works for you and stick to it. Also use diagrams more and embrace a messy page; don't waste time making things neat and uniform because you'll miss important info. Still prioritise the class-specific details since you can get general information from innumerable sources online even if they aren't sources for your specific 9am class. 

My notes are an absolute *shitshow*. They're completely unintelligible to anyone but me but they worked. They had all the information I needed for my specific classes, the shorthand is my own, and the chaotic mess of arrows and margin scribbling places information right where I need it to be and where I can access it the fastest."
cambridge_uni,fenxxox,t1_fenixw2,1579292493.0,"Unfortunately there is only one 2.5 hour course available to me through any channel for my area, and I already did that one last term. Central university only offers the one session, my college offers none (that I can find, not that I'm working for them), and my department offers none and doesn't even require the ""mandatory"" central training. 

The one I did was a general STEM one too, so they didn't even go into any of what a supervision entails, just stuff like ""what would you do if a student seems upset?"", ""what would you do if a student stops showing up?"". The answer to literally every question was ""go to the DOS"". 

I might sit in on a friend's supervision to see how he does it and what the students actually do while they're there, not sure if that will be before or after my first supervision though."

So sorry for whoever gets me and the others in my cohort doing the same thing! But the only way to learn how to supervise is to supervise, we have no other choice... and of course, “the fastest way to learn is to teach others”. On the first day I will show up and be “supervising”. No idea what I’m actually going to do though, having never seen a supervision before."
cambridge_uni,femcm9g,t1_felqoue,1579248716.0,"Although it should be noted that most of us have no training. The entirety of our “training” consists of half a day sitting in a room theorizing about what we’d do in certain circumstances. There is absolutely no practice before you’re assigned students. The ones you found better were probably more experienced or had supervised that course before. 

It’s very different from actually tutoring someone and the courses we’re supervising are not necessarily courses we’ve ever taken. There is obviously quite a bit of learning on the fly, mostly because every course involves a bit of busy work that you later abandon when you learn more advanced methods, so even if we did take the course or a similar one, we might be revising content we haven’t thought about for 5+ years. 

But hey, we need the money and this is often the only approved work we’re allowed to do inside or outside of Cambridge. Even people who don’t want to supervise get stuck supervising."

It's simply harder for students from less privileged backgrounds to compete, and that makes it hard for them to assess applications in a fair way. Taking those personal circumstances into account is hard when you don't have all the information, and it really bothers them. They're always talking about how difficult the process is, that they feel unsure, that maybe there were other factors they missed in assessing someone. 

It's no consolation to you or your friends, but there is room and a strong internal desire for change. The societies for working class students are working hard at it, but all things within Oxbridge move slowly, more slowly than we'd ever like.

6thForm,fegkt8j,t3_ep1p04,1579095860.0,"When I applied for the Rhodes scholarship at Oxford in 2017, my grandfather fell seriously ill and had to be hospitalised, and I was the only one who could visit him. I had to leave his bedside for a weekend in order to fly out to the interview. I didn't get the scholarship, which meant I couldn't go to Oxford. Shortly after I told him that I hadn't won, he died. I've had success since then but he never got to know any of it, only the failures. 

But I know he didn't think *I* was a failure, nor did my parents. There's a pretty good chance that your parents think you're the best human being alive, even if they logically know that you probably aren't. They've felt that way since you were a baby, when they thought that you were the absolute best baby to have ever existed. Tell your parents that you didn't get in and they'll come up with a bunch of reasons, but none of them will be ""BritPetrol wasn't good enough"". They know what you don't: it's Oxford's loss. Or at least, it *can* be if you want it to be. 

Go somewhere else and do such great things that this rejection becomes an interesting little tidbit in your life. Be such an amazing individual that Oxford wonders how they missed the signs. Be an inspiration for all the kids in the future who get rejected from stuff and think it's the end of the world. They can point to you and say ""BritPetrol was rejected from Oxford and just look at what they've done -- I don't need Oxford either"".

Don't get too down on rejections. They can teach you a lot and pave the way for success later on, which almost paradoxically makes them good. My Rhodes ""failure"" showed me the things I needed to work on, and I wouldn't be where I am today without it. If you think you had a bad interview, think about what you could do better next time and apply what you learn to other universities or to future job interviews. This ""failure"" to get into Oxford could be the thing that gets you your dream job -- but only if you *want* it to. 

Take today to wallow in self-pity and eat pizza, cry into a pillow all day if that's what you need to do, but then put the issue aside and start working on your game plan for the future. You tried your best but you got too invested in the process, and now you're being burned by all those daydreams you allowed yourself on a future that wasn't set. So it's time to stop caring. If people ask you if you got in, tell them ""no"" as if you don't care, because you won't. 

And think about going to a counsellor. It can help to just verbalise everything you're thinking and feeling, and they can help you develop coping methods so these kinds of strong emotions don't overwhelm you in the future."

I think they can all be pretty restrictive when it comes to undergraduate research. It isn’t too uncommon for people to start research in the first year and publish first-author publications as undergrads in Australia, but it seems much, much more uncommon here in the UK. That may be because the 4th year here is less research intensive as it is in Australia, where you’re mostly working on your thesis all year. 

We’re certainly much more informal and have more contact with our lecturers. I think my first year was ~25 contact hours a week, not including stuff like getting coffee or discussing work in office hours. And that’s almost entirely with the lecturers, not with any graduate student tutors."
6thForm,fedxpyl,t1_fedu47d,1579022103.0,"No, no real difference in depth.

On the research side of things I think I’m *more* prepared than those who did their undergrad here. I’m probably more comfortable with the “infrastructure” of research, and have a more solid system for how I organise my projects and write up just because I’ve done it all a few times before.

I had 5 years of research experience in astronomy and it’s much easier to hit the ground running on a new astronomy project with so much relevant experience, and a lot easier to pick a project that I know I’ll enjoy.

I think that kind of experience is harder to get at Camb and most people only have their 4th year project to call on, so they’re still going through the growing pains of learning to do research when they start the PhD.

I looked forward to exams because they gave me an excuse to do what I loved for 4 hours. Even when I did LSD, I opted to study physics.

In between semesters I picked up research gigs just so I wouldn't have to take any time off from it. When I'm coding, there is nothing in the universe except the code and the problem, and I genuinely love being in that state. I actually spend more time and effort forcing myself to take breaks and keep my weekends work-free because I know that I'd get ""lost"" in that state otherwise, because I've done it before. I would choose research over hanging out with friends, watching tv, playing video games, and even eating and sleeping. 

Asking why someone likes physics is like asking them *why* their favourite colour is their favourite. Sure, some people have an answer with a story, but most people just have a favourite colour with no story behind it. Or why they like chocolate, or strawberries, or mac and cheese. 

I don't just like or love the work I do. It's like some undeniable fact of the universe that I must do it, and I *could* quit tomorrow, but I would just find other ways to get my physics fix. I can't stay away from it. It's just an addiction that I get paid for, really.

In Honours, we had to do a full course load of graduate classes while also doing our research project and writing up our theses. First chapter of the thesis was due after 2 months. And the whole ~150 pages and defense had to be done in 10 months. These days I think it's actually pretty irresponsible to have to do it all in under a year because of the insane damage it did to us all.

Despite only having 1 document to assess (my ATAS certificate), UKVI still managed to make a mistake on my visa and lose my passport, and I found it impossible to get in contact to even get clarification. I asked the international students office at Cambridge to also reach out on my behalf and they had more luck. Don't be afraid to ask them for guidance when you apply for the visa.

As for moving, I packed a few bits and pieces into one suitcase and put the rest into storage. I knew I'd need to buy winter gear once I got here anyway. I do recommend flying into one of the closer airports like Stansted though, instead of Heathrow. Stansted has a direct train line in the airport, while Heathrow you have to do transfers. I didn't trust myself to get it right after 30 hours of travel (21 on a plane). Once you get to Cambridge it's much easier: just catch a cab from right outside the station to your college, head to the front office, and they'll direct you from there. 

There's a bunch of stuff you have to do when you arrive, and setting up a bank account in particular will be booked out weeks in advance, so I strongly recommend arriving as early as your college will allow you.

Also recommend getting a TransferWise or Revolut account so you can avoid currency conversion fees and have a card.

All of my previous work had been on black hole jets - how they're observed, how we measure them, how they impact their environment. For PhD, I was moving to black hole accretion disks, which is a bit of a jump.

I mentioned in my SOP about how I became interested in the field 2 years earlier because of a random comment a presenter had made during a conference talk - basically just shit-talking one model for accretion, but it wasn't my field, I'd used that model before (in valid situations), and I hadn't heard all the bad things about it before. I couldn't let it go, and I ended up applying to PhD projects in that area.

And a great PI who's supportive, fosters your independence, encouraging, attentive, kind etc will spearhead your career. Not just that, but you will be a better researcher when you're not struggling to survive in a toxic environment. Take advantage of every resource to figure out if they're a good person to work with. If you need to pick between the best school, the best topic, and the best PI - go with the PI. The best school will be useless when you drop out or commit suicide. The best topic will also be useless when you're too ill to focus on it and grow to hate everything associated with academia. 

2. **FUNDING**. It can be really hard to get and come with a bunch of weird strings attached, so you have to spend literal hours researching how it works at each school. Don't just assume that you'll get a nice, fat offer of money with your acceptances. You may need to apply to scholarships and the deadlines may be quite early. I'm at Cambridge - our funding decisions are released months after admissions, and after the deadline for a response to many US schools, making it a really risky gamble. Also related, housing."

PhD,fcw3lhc,t1_fcvx6q1,1578016358.0,">If anything, me not being a student meant that nothing should have been done at all.

And nothing *was* done. They did the preliminary check, found that your complaint was insane and deranged, and then ignored you. They did this because you're a member of the general public. People who are not students or faculty can absolutely file complaints, it's just rarer. And in most of those cases, they'd involve someone who was contracted out so they'd be held under the procedure of their workplace. If there is no explicit system for handing complaints from the public then it falls under the direction of the person who takes the complaint, with guidance from others in the university. Basically, the dean decides how you ought to be treated, and is only very vaguely guided by the procedures for staff, students, and contractors. 

>Even if this the case, the student has to fill out and sign the paper work before the university can investigate at all.

Except they didn't actually investigate. A ""preliminary investigation"" is not a formal investigation nor an informal one. It precedes any real investigation. It precedes any paperwork. It is simply a fact-finding exercise. If someone claims to be a student and places a complaint against a faculty member, the preliminary investigation is like checking that they're actually a student and were actually in the class they claimed to be in. It's where they may reach out to the accused to clarify information, or to provide emails. This is exactly what the dean did, as they should have done. They found your complaint to be baseless and did not proceed with a formal *or* informal grievance. The only record of this is to make sure there's a record of *your* behaviour. It does not harm the professor. 

>Thus, the student and faculty member are encouraged to work out the issue themselves.

**You are not a student.** You are not entitled to ""work out"" any issues. That it entirely the professor's choice if they want to meet with you, so much so that the dean cannot even suggest it. That would be highly inappropriate. The professor must come up with the idea on their own, they must contact you on their own. She clearly does not want to do this. If you truly respect her then you should respect her wishes on this matter.

The problem is that all PhDs are different. In order to be comparable to r/MBA, we'd need a sub for physics PhDs, chemistry PhDs, sociology PhDs, music theory PhDs, etc etc. There aren't anywhere near enough people to do that, so we're all together. It means that we can't really give profile reviews. The value of the ones that *are* here is, well, limited at best. 

How many people here do you think are in theoretical/computational astrophysics concerning accretion disks around SMBH's? Because that's the kind of people I'd need to get a meaningful profile review. Even other areas within astrophysics is really pushing it, let alone physics, let alone STEM, let alone PhDs and Masters in general. 

>There are limited metrics that they grade you on. Grades, ECs, writing, creativity etc.

There are limited metrics, but they're far more nebulous than the ones you get assessed by for an MBA. PhDs are really judged on their fit - it's the metric that can fix all others or undo all others. It can be hard to know where you fit, or if you'll be the best fitting candidate in any given year. Plus, a lot of (most?) programs simply will not give feedback other than to say that it was a competitive application cycle and they encourage you to reapply the next cycle. The only feedback they ever seem to give is really obvious stuff: there is no one available to supervise your subject, your GPA is unacceptably low, you have no research experience."

What if the student writes the president of their university that they want their professor fired because they didn't like their email tone or some other trivial reason? Should the president fire then professor because an angry/distressed student wrote to them? Or do they direct them back down to the faculty member and tell them that if they can't resolve the issue, they can then write to the chair etc.?

I feel like you've misread a lot of university ordinances and procedures. 

1. You're not a student. You weren't a student when you complained, you were a member of the general public. The procedures regarding student complaints do not apply to you. Stop referencing them. End of.

2. The actual procedure, after a complaint is made, is usually to first do a preliminary investigation. In your case, this means they would have read all correspondence between you and the professor. If, *and only if*, evidence is found that the complaint is warranted do they then go ahead with the actual procedure, which would be the reconciliation steps you've read about (but only if you were a student, which you were/are not). So whilst the preliminary investigation is part of a formal process, it is not the entire process. Your complaint likely never got beyond the preliminary stage because it was an unfounded complaint. The formal investigation is halted, and never harms the faculty member. This is precisely to protect them against people like you who file frivolous complaints with no basis in reality."

In practice, this means you need to have experience doing that work to a spectacular level. 

The job of an academic is not to take exams, and so getting extra time on an exam is no mark against someone. We aren't expected to regurgitate information under exam conditions in the ""real world"". 

But we *are* expected to work the hours stated in our contract, to teach, to perform research, to act on various committees, and to maintain all of the relationships that go along with that. We have to do all of these tasks to a satisfactory level. If your accommodations would require you to work on a reduced workload or part-time then what you're signalling to employers is that you are unable to handle a full workload competently. They can be understanding of this for students who are working full-time in the field while completing their degree, but that won't be you. They can see how long it took you to complete your degree and how many classes you took at a time from your transcripts. They can't see if someone got extra time on exams, but they'd hardly care. I would happily tell my colleagues that I used to get extra time because no part of my work requires me to perform exams under exam-conditions, and so it's pretty irrelevant if I got an extra half-hour. 

I thought about getting accommodations for my PhD (as I'm still just as disabled as before), but there are actually none I can be granted. Extra time on exams, sanctioned absences from class, and extensions on assignments are pretty useless when I don't have exams, don't take classes, and don't have assignments.

So I'm worried about how I""ll handle balancing multiple times the workload with teaching/research assistantship responsibilities etc. 

I found undergrad quite stressful, but I was pursuing a double major, working multiple jobs (and managing the financial insecurity that came with it), performing research, and doing a lot of outreach work that took me out of classes for weeks on end. It was never the coursework alone that made me stressed, it was juggling many commitments. Most undergrads have *some* kind of outside commitment - work, family responsibilities, research, sport, clubs etc - which causes a lot of stress. University should be treated like a full-time job and they're trying to work more than one. I'm sure loads of undergrads would find things pretty easy if they only took on an average courseload and had no other responsibilities sapping their time. 

I'd be more worried that you have no experience in managing multiple ""streams"" of work. A PhD requires you to juggle more than just coursework and research - you'll have many other responsibilities.

>Is it really that stressful and is the stress/pressure constant?

Yes, it is that stressful. There is a constant baseline of stress just due to the nature of how we work. Very few things are ""required"" or ""mandatory"" in a PhD, but there are plenty of things that you need to do if you want a shot at getting a job. And unlike in undergrad, that work is never actually done. It doesn't matter how many hours I work or how many papers I publish, I can always do more because there's no end. In undergrad you have semesters and assignment due dates and grades. I have none of that. There is little guidance on what to do, how to do it, or when to do it by. If you're an anxious person like me, you'll default to the mindset of ""this must be completed ASAP"", which means overworking and burning yourself out. 

And then there are the spikes in stress when you do have a few deadlines around the same time, which always seems to happen. Grant applications, undergraduate grading, thesis drafts, and presentations will always seem to happen in the space of a few days. Sometimes other people make mistakes or we simply have bad luck and I have to drop everything and scramble to fix it. That's acute stress. But I think it's the constant, low-level stuff that slowly drives people a bit weird.

I've had mental health troubles for a long time, but I've put a lot into my treatment. I saw a team of mental health professionals every week during undergrad, then took a year off before my PhD to make sure it was under control. I think I'm managing it reasonably well now but it has taken nearly 7 years of different treatments to find what works and develop good coping mechanisms."
gradadmissions,fc1t18c,t3_eflce5,1577328797.0,"Hey, I have a very similar history - a pretty sharp fall from grace into what my mother would call ""the wrong crowd"". Looking back now, it's all so terrifying how quickly things progressed. I went from the level of a cigarette, a single beer, and one blunt to a full-on heroin user in only a few months. It just spiralled out of control. 

Recovery was so painful. Living that life sucked, sure, but it sucked even more to have my mother pick me up from school after I was banned and to know how much she hated me. All the shame of multiple family meetings where I had to apologise to each family member. The complete loss of privacy - no doors allowed to be closed, no seeing friends or leaving the house, phone and computer monitored, journals read, always within sight of a family member. 

I never told my friends at university. I never mentioned it in any scholarship applications, or my applications for graduate school. Who knows, maybe I would have gotten the Rhodes scholarship if I'd been more honest about my background and my motivation for the work I do, but... idk. Imagine if it became some kind of inspirational story that they published in the newspaper. My parents would be mortified. 

Things aren't easier now I'm in a PhD program, especially because the people here are so privileged. It's not something that'll ever come up in casual conversation, so I doubt I'll ever tell my friends, but then it's hard to feel close to people when you're keeping a ""secret"" like that. But I can't go back to the way I was either. So I'm stuck part way between them - two completely different lives that I can't even reconcile in my head even when *I'm* the one who's lived them both. 

It's not easy, but you can change and move on to better things. I think it's made me more resilient and determined, knowing how much I had to sacrifice to be here."

Business casual is probably fine - I'm a girl and I wore a blazer, which I guess is more business than business casual. Treat it like any other interview. 

>Also, on the website it says they will ask what you know about gates scholarships - are they essentially going to be quizzing you on Gates/Gates Foundation?

You should know the super trivial stuff like when it was founded, how much the donation was, and what the main aims are. It's just a basic check to see that you're invested in the opportunity and not just applying for the sake of getting funding. There are a lot of extra responsibilities and extra work that comes with the Gates scholarship - it isn't money for free and you should be aware of what you're potentially signing up for. 

>Lastly, do they seem to run through a fixed set of questions or is it more conversational sort of?

AFAIK, even within a single panel everyone gets different questions. It's based on your application. There might be a few common ones like ""why Cambridge"", ""why Gates"", and ""why does your research matter / why should we fund you when we could fund cancer/climate change/poverty research"", but once they ask about your own experiences and plans, it's a unique interview. They'll have some questions prepared, but they can also ask unscripted questions based on what you say during the interview. You'll also be asked at the end if you have any questions, and you should - make sure it's something with a purpose that you can't just google."
