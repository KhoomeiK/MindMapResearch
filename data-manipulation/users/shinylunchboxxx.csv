EntitledBitch,fff13el,t1_fff0dxm,1579872776.0,"Kids learn through practise. Leaving their house and trial and error. How can we expects them to only learn through theory? We can't put logic to this because kids don't give a fuck about logic and reason. They're children! They test boundaries well into their teens. Do we expect mother's to live in exile tor 16 years?

People need groceries and haircuts and all such things. Kids need to be pushed out the nest in order to show how they behave.

Honestly, my comment started from people in this comment section talking about a child who died due to a revolving restaurant and they basically said ""that's what you get"". This anti child movement is fucked up.
We could all benefit from a little compassion."
EntitledBitch,ffex299,t3_eszwnf,1579869002.0,"You guys are insane, acting like children are some other species and hating them before they have a chance.

It's not just parents who can leave an impression on a child, but also the people functioning in the world around them. 

Ridiculous that people think turning their nose up at a human who has known this world only for a few years would have any effect, how could you expect then to understand if their parents won't show them? Set a good example and maybe they will have a chance. How awful of you to be so ready to throw them away.

There's a reason we don't let kids drive or drink. They haven't fully developed emotionally or mentally. To expect a child to understand or even obey 100% of the time is foolish and I can guarantee the people who get upset with my comment either don't have kids or are the kind who say ""my little Emily/Billy would never blah blah blah"""

Nicegirls,ffbwouy,t1_ffbu8l0,1579785241.0,"Not sure if you mean texture of colour, but


If colour, try a green concealer stick before your usual make up routine. Green counteracts red, so should help! I know in my country that Maybelline do an inexpensive one. 


If for texture, unfortunately there isn't really much. Don't be misled on what most people's skin looks like. We're bombarded daily with pictures of airbrushed, perfect models and it's terrible. Real people have texture and bumps in their skin. It's wonderful and defining. I try to make myself think on the last time I saw someone with acne and I honestly can't remember. You will be your own worst critic and you need to be kinder to yourself.


I've had a bit to drink, so I'm sorry for the rambling, but I just felt it needed to be said for you and for anyone else reading."

educationalgifs,fec15s6,t1_feboxvx,1578965128.0,People can be oddly sensitive when it comes to what they eat. From the strange fetishisation of bacon to blind hatred for anything labelled vegan.

Might also interest you to know that marg is always used when eating Vegemite! 
Thank you for the well wishes!"
educationalgifs,fe8fl1w,t1_fe8dcp7,1578925619.0,Guess it's just something you get used to! Marg is better for your health than butter and it's also vegan friendly so it has an appeal. I keep both in my fridge!

Any time someone is going to ""butter bread"" for a snag, sandwich, toast or to make fairy bread it's always marg. We have some real good stuff here, though. The one I get it butter flavour too! Maybe it's not so great everywhere else?"
