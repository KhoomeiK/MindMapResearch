ShouldIbuythisgame,ff7tcim,t3_ert9ax,1579657873.0,"Despite what some may say, if you like a great story with good characters and intense gameplay, CoD WWII campaign is fantastic. As someone who grew up not being able to play online, I grew up with WW2 shooters like MoH and CoD. Absolutely gorgeous graphics and movie-like cinematics. 10/10 would recommend. A great reboot of CoD campaigns (as far as WW2 games) and definitely worth the purchase. Hope this helps!"
