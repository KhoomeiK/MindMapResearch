onebag,ffjwtf5,t1_ffi99ya,1580009118.0,This is what I do too! I have a bag mine resides in to stow it and keep it clean.  I use a fresh pair of tube socks that I cut the toes off as fresh “pillowcases” since I travel frequently.

nextfuckinglevel,feovwrk,t1_feourk2,1579306552.0,What nonsense are you talking about?
nextfuckinglevel,feovt17,t1_feov29h,1579306489.0,Actually current practice is to give 5 hard back blows between the shoulder blades before starting the Heimlich.  Just learned that in my recertification course last year.
mildlyinteresting,fenuo6j,t1_fenj2wp,1579291075.0,Or an office building that agreed to be a showcase for different equipment.  We almost agreed to do this with our new build but they wanted to be able to remodel the bathrooms every so years but during business hours with no accommodation to the office workers
IdiotsInCars,fen2v8k,t1_femqowg,1579275752.0,"Yeah, I allow merges but when it’s the assholes running around a lane that has been marked as turn only and is a solid line and they are doing it to get ahead of everyone then I get pissed.  There is one section of road where more people barge into the lane than those in the lane get to turn.  We have asked the city to put up a divider to stop the behavior. It likely won’t happen, but more and more of this merging is happening.  It’s disgustingly bad driving.  I need to get video of this because people don’t believe when I say how bad it is."
medizzy,felmzse,t1_fekl95s,1579226058.0,"My grandmother wore heels all her life and it shortened her Achilles.  She can’t walk barefoot because it hurts too much.  Every foot dr I have ever seen wants to ban heels and cheap flip flops for the damage it does to people’s feet , then over time, knees, hips and back.  

Best friend quit wearing heels and her lower back pain has gone away.

We as a society find heels look nice, but they do damage the body and cause an unnatural walk and stance."

badwomensanatomy,fedw5yj,t1_fedoicy,1579021164.0,"Actually the heat and health of the male determines sex.  Which is why the hot laptop idea is valid warning for men, or a valid birth control method depending on your viewpoint.

ExpectationVsReality,febyjfj,t1_feby1qq,1578964329.0,"Ok, I prefer wax paper because when cold items slip off it.  The plastic stuff sticks and it comes off uneven, doesn’t matter how cold you get stuff."
ExpectationVsReality,febvh3t,t1_febvdqt,1578963165.0,Nope wax paper is what you are looking for.
ExpectationVsReality,febut9j,t1_febqo2u,1578962989.0,"Not acetate, just wax paper.  Plus the top one was likely colder when they removed it."

interestingasfuck,fdt44yf,t1_fdt3om7,1578711670.0,"They do.  All tires have a small arrow, or a triangle or in the case of Michelin’s they have mr bib where the wear bar is.  Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) require that tires be manufactured with tire wear bars. Most tires have at least six or more tread wear bars."
interestingasfuck,fdt3ly6,t1_fdsir24,1578711475.0,Usually there are multiple wear bars on a tire so really no need to move your car.
interestingasfuck,fdt3eq5,t1_fdt1nsv,1578711402.0,It is.  It’s called a wear bar.
interestingasfuck,fdt33uq,t1_fdt0zsu,1578711290.0,"Where to start.  Well better tires have improved tread design to move water away from the center of the tire to prevent hydroplaning.  

The rubber quality and the various fillers can determine durability or performance.  For example a high end tire for a Mercedes is likely soft rubber which grips  well, reduces noise but wears out quickly.  Lower end tires last longer, but pass through rough bumps and increased road noise.  

Little things like how the sidewall is designed, how the valve stem is set up, to how the layers of wire and rubber are laid down all define a high end or low end tire."
DidntKnowIWantedThat,fdt18xh,t1_fdsysif,1578710606.0,This is standard on all tires.  All tires have wear bars.

AmItheAsshole,fdluozk,t1_fdl9tzh,1578532924.0,"Where is safer other than an actual safe to store medicine?  Bedside cabinet doesn’t seem safer, neither does the linen closet!  And if you put them where 5hey aren’t easy to stumble upon, then you are more likely to forget about them.  It baffles me that people think medicines should not all be kept together."
loseit,fdirs53,t3_elcwlr,1578449593.0,Our office has a gym and I go walk on the treadmill for 20-30 minutes.  I don’t walk fast because I don’t change except shoes.  It’s become my getaway since they have free WiFi and my office mates can’t find me.

travel,fct6pv0,t3_eimnm6,1577934312.0,What about a cruise that does different countries? Preferably one you don’t have to tender to get to shore.  You need to consider her health and abilities.  On a cruise She would be able to come back to the same room every night but see lots during the day.
Horses,fct4tom,t3_eiqotf,1577932902.0,"When I was younger our barn required that you wear you helmet at any time around a horse if you were under 18.  Likely saved my life when I slipped/tripped and landed near a horse who defensively kicked out and caught the side of my head.  Broke my helmet, fractured my jaw and I lost two teeth.  Even the calmest horse can react in a weird situation."

Edit, I just went and checked her.  She can jump more now that she has healed a bit (shelter cat) but the other helper said she won’t be able to get on counters cause her legs are dumpy.  Not nice when cats can’t jump to escape dog attacks."
