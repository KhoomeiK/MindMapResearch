Exactly, that's the problem. In C whenever you create an object you have to manually destroy it and free the memory. In C++ if you use those 'fuckin virtual destructors' whenever you create an object... it takes care of itself to properly destroy and free the memory. That's the magic - you won't leak because you don't have to explicitly free anything.

The problem is that people:

1. Pass bare pointers instead of smart pointers when passing ownership.
2. Pass smart pointers instead of bare pointers/references when not passing ownership.
3. Use `shared_ptr` where `unique_ptr` should be.
4. Allocate memory that a destructor won't automatically free (because their destructor sucks).

I'm sorry to break the news, but if to you 'fuckin virtual destructors' are only there to 'mess up' and you're in the 'C++ errors can't be read' club, then you should go back to some Programming For Beginners course, because clearly you're here to hop on the 'C++ too hard' train instead of actually learning."

Because people are simply not needed.

Back in the day you had, let's say, a baker in the village. Everyone liked the baker, should the baker be gone, the entire village wouldn't have a bread until a new one appears, and that could take months.

Nowadays a baker competes with:

- the supermarket

- the baker two villages away (yay cars)

- another supermarket

- delivery services

So if he's gone... nobody even notices, they quickly switch. It's not that the baker puts frozen bread into a machine and that's it. The problem is that nobody actually needs the baker.

It doesn't matter whether dad hunts animals or puts numbers into computer - the real question is: do we really need dad, or can mum support us without dad and it'd still be fine?

The same is valid for every aspect of life. A big company can fire a specialist and not even notice, a small company will think twice before they fire an intern. When you can easily visit your friends in France, what's the purpose of having friends at your place in Spain if they're not as interesting? What's the point of having a partner that isn't fun at all times, when you can easily 100% support yourself? Why be nice to random strangers, when you can get any information for free and any service possible for low cost via your mobile? We. Are. Meaningless.

At the same time I have a very strong opinion about garbage collectors: 99% of the time memory management is actually quite trivial for the programmer (you just have to apply a few patterns and keep your program structured), but at the same time it's a very complex task for the computer. The result is that garbage collection is inherently inefficient and a stupid idea, but it's a necessary evil because most devs are just 'monkey sees, monkey codes', so they need a safe playground where they can't fuck up too much.

I'm just saying that lots of research went into creating modern garbage collectors and they're still full of problems, while a typical JS programmer would learn how to free your damn memory in one week max."

Well, I don't know how do they make this conclusion, in particular that use of 'at least' is VERY misleading and makes the whole article scientifically worthless. I'd like to point out there are huge differences between people - some have been poor literally since the first society ever formed, some people are born poor, but die rich.
