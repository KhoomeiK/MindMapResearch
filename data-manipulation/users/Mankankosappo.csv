ShittyLifeProTips,ffaazv1,t1_ffa6tkr,1579731365.0,">What do people who think ""there are two gender"" believe about me? That I am lying, deceiving myself? 

So im gonna answer this with my opinions on the matter.

I think there are only two genders. I think the whole concept of gender is based on outdated gender sterotypes. Personality traits, clothing and pretty everything other than actual biological feature such as a penis or vagina are needlessly gendered. Because these sterotypes can often be opressive to people who dont conform to them, new genders were invented so people can feel comfortable being who they want to be. I personally think the correct way to fight this is fight against gender stereotypes instead and have gender only really be relavant for medical purposes.

Its not so much that I disagree with mutiple genders, and if you want to call yourself non-binary to feel comfortae then you do you, its just I think gender tells me nothing about a person except the chromosone make up (so really we do need a 3rd gender for homaphrodites, I guess)."
