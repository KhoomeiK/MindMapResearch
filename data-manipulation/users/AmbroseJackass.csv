fatlogic,ffib096,t1_ffia5jv,1579969576.0,"Thank you so much.  It will be a long and arduous road back to eating whatever the fuck I want whenever I want it, but I’m sure it will be worth it in the end."
fatlogic,ffiaxiv,t1_ffiamrp,1579969523.0,"Yeah it’s a massive slice.  But like, still.  Jesus."
fatlogic,ffi3ukj,t1_ffhzvhd,1579964304.0,"Seriously.  I LOVE the chocolate cake at the Cheesecake Factory, I used to get it allll the time.  Then I found out one slice is 1400 calories, and now I only have it on my birthday.  I must have an eating disorder I guess?"

fatlogic,ff1rxqo,t1_feyf5v9,1579484840.0,Just watched that episode yesterday!  I think my favorite episode is the guy who eats like a mixing bowl full of cereal with *heavy whipping cream* on it- he's making it through ~2000cal by breakfast

TopSecretRecipes,fcli6hu,t1_fcl9yf6,1577748364.0,"Agree, I love Monterey Jack or jack blends because they melt well, but have way more flavor than mozzarella."
pettyrevenge,fcj0nii,t1_fchaxxp,1577674347.0,"Interesting, I understand hazards to mean “something is wrong with my car/I am about to do something unexpected.”  Usually used by Uber drivers to indicate they’re going to stop in the middle of a traffic lane to pick someone up, or used by someone with something tied to the roof of the car.  If someone turned on their hazards in front of me I would wonder what they are about to do, not look for something I am doing wrong."
