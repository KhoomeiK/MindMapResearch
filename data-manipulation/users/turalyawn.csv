IncelTears,ffyhfjb,t1_ffygn25,1580346504.0,"I figured. Not being into sexuality must really put incel's obsession with it into perspective. I enjoy sex, but if I go an extended period without it life just goes on. The way incels make sex central to their identity is the cause of so many problems, not the least of which is that if/when they do have sex, they will certainly be disappointed."
IncelTears,ffy8yaq,t1_ffy5t3y,1580340888.0,"They won't, they cling to incel because it paints them as victims and allows them to spew vitriol at others. Asexuals are presumably perfectly satisfied with a sexless life, and honestly must find incels baffling."

As someone who works hard and pays his fair share, I'm sick of corporate welfare and a safety net for the wealthy. 

I'm sure you'll say ""but the businesses will just leave the country"". Boo-hoo, let them, after we've extracted the assets owed to us.

My whole point is it's not the dream come true some people think it is to land a lead in Star Wars."

todayilearned,ffk37e2,t1_ffk2zjn,1580014412.0,"Yes, he and Natalie Portman and Harrison Ford all became established film leads. But that's it, for all the fame the franchise gives you. Either you were already established going in, or you kind of fall off the map otherwise. And it fucking ruined poor Jake Lloyd."
todayilearned,ffk31at,t1_ffk23xq,1580014263.0,"She's trying, and I wish her luck. Same as all of them. But most in franchise history don't succeed, despite the fame. Harrison Ford obviously has been A-List since the early 80s. Once Indiana Jones blew up he had 2 franchises. Natalie Portman and Adam Driver have also done well. But outside of that film acting has not been great for most actors who get their first fame from SW."
todayilearned,ffk2qol,t1_ffk2h9p,1580014001.0,I did mention licensing. But I was referring to regular acting jobs.
todayilearned,ffk2oxu,t1_ffk2bhf,1580013958.0,"I'm not saying it's impossible. But the history of the entire franchise says that while some successful actors do emerge, most remain always associated with SW and never forge their own identity. I get why Harrison Ford was grumpy about reprising Han, he was one of the few that broke through."
todayilearned,ffk2eva,t1_ffk1x7d,1580013714.0,"Totally! And fortunately for him he's really good at it so he made it work. I hope the same for everyone from the Disney films, because outside of Harrison Ford, Natalie Portman (the Professional doesn't count cuz she was a kid) and Adam Driver you can't say too many people who got their start in SW made bank later as actors. And you get sad stories like Jake Lloyd and the dude who played Jar Jar. They didn't deserve the bullshit they had to deal with."
todayilearned,ffk0zuk,t1_ffjzq30,1580012498.0,"Look at her filmography. She is the furthest thing from A-List. I rather suspect it's a bit of a raw deal for someone like her. She gets all of the fame of being a-list, without the regular jobs because a: Disney owns you for the duration of the trilogy cycle and b: you become far too ubiquitous (edit: and tied to one franchise) to be appealing for other roles. Unless she's getting back-end I imagine her earning prospects outside of licensing and fandoms aren't *that* high.

Edit: yes, I'm aware of Adam Driver. Harrison Ford too. Not arguing you can't have a career after Star Wars, but that most don't succeed as film stars despite the fame, and some really deal with some shit, like the actors for Rose and Jar Jar and, yes, Rey."

PrequelMemes,ffjtw7u,t1_ffjtl17,1580006817.0,"George is an idea and vision guy, and if you just look at an outline of the prequels it seems pretty fantastic. But yeah, way to much stuff for 7 hours of movies, and so badly executed.

PrequelMemes,ffji4pz,t1_ffjhmnh,1579998721.0,"I agree with that, I really liked the one that showed the separatist parliament, and some of the Senate intrigue stuff was really good. But the prequels cast a long shadow over them and their depiction of politics was just...not great. Plus as much as I like some of the political episodes, I like the ones about the jedi and Sith, and about the clones, more."
PrequelMemes,ffjh2hf,t1_ffjcxmi,1579998084.0,"But none of those space operas are Star Wars, which tends to be better on a small scale or in fantastic situations, not sweeping dissertations on the evils of galactic capitalism."

PrequelMemes,ffj2rdv,t1_ffj0856,1579988928.0,"Yeah I think that's a fair criticism of it. A lot of wheel-spinning episodes in between 10-15 really amazing episodes.

What I'm saying is that reading the letter of at-will legislation as it's currently interpreted federally, driving a beater does not in any way make you a protected class. Hell, I believe the US is a year or two away from LGBT protections being removed, as they are not actually in the legislation, but are just enforced unilaterally at an agency level.
