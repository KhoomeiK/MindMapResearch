rpghorrorstories,fgpseky,t1_fgp7gsy,1581011089.0,My dad ran a game where he sprung it on his players and it went pretty well. They started on a cruise ship with “patient zero” and they had a Walking Dead-like beginning where people panic and things go crazy while they try to live. After they finally got to land weeks later they found society had collapsed/was collapsing and then it became more “zombies are there but people trying to live are more dangerous.” Sadly the game didn’t get much further because one player didn’t like that it wasn’t a power fantasy vidya game scenario. I think he was shocked by the fact his awesome ability to dual wield pistols didn’t give him an advantage over 30-some bikers with rifles.

That said... it’s more an issue of the D20 system as a whole if you ask me, but I’ve not enjoyed that system for years. As you say, if you don’t optimize to get the best bonuses, you’ll simply fail by the fact probability isn’t really on a scale of “average” results, meaning your chances at success or failure are wildly random. The 3D6 concept, where you have an average result around 8-12 or so, meaning on average a specialist should succeed often, is much more interesting. It makes criticals more rare and rewards optimal builds.

Personally I’d rather play games like Savage Worlds or FFG’s systems, where everything just feels better to do and they tend to be bogged down with fewer numbers to really encourage RP and creativity. I admit to simply having lots of bad D&D experiences and that has definitely colored my opinion of the game and it’s systems negatively."

If you haven’t, check out how Savage Worlds and Legend of the Five Rings (Fantasy Flight Games’s’ version) handles roleplaying detriments. Savage Worlds has you take Hindrances at creation, from physical drawbacks to adherence to moral codes of your design, in order to purchase Edges, which would often be class abilities or feats in D&D. 

L5R is a samurai drama, so creation has you build in social challenges, such as your duty as a samurai versus personal desires you want to achieve. It also has you take flaws which again vary between a physical problem to weaknesses in social situations, which this game treats as just as deadly as any physical conflict. This game even has a little NPC thing like you have, though less defined by simply giving them a strength towards one skill, weakness towards another, and altering target numbers to affect them socially by their preference of approach, such as favoring flattery or hating direct arguments."

rpghorrorstories,ff37m62,t1_ff335n3,1579535606.0,"Honestly, the fact it’s so poorly understood adds to my belief it shouldn’t be in the game at all. The only time it’s ever come up is when someone says “your alignment wouldn’t do that.” A mechanical penalty in a forced alignment shift for not acting in line with how someone else might see that alignment. 

I just want to give two examples: first, a reply to the “gods are embodiments of an alignment.” If I have two Lawful Good gods, but one is a god of divine retribution and the other is a god of peace, which law is correct? If a follower of one acts in favor of the other, perhaps sparing a criminal in hopes of reform, they have broken a law yet upheld another. While it’s fair to say each god holds fast to and represents a strict set of beliefs and ways of thinking, calling them “Lawful Good” isn’t really helpful. I do admit that it this can be a weaker argument since you can get an immediate look at whether a god will line up with your character or not, but I see them as too nuanced for that. 

Another example comes strictly from perspective. Let’s take a pirate character. People would call them Chaotic Evil or Chaotic Neutral immediately, because they have no need for the laws of the land (heh) and they’re generally selfishly driven by greed and wanderlust. What if these pirates have a specific code that must never be broken? An unshakable thing that every seaman must follow or face the scorn or every sailor and pirate together? Suddenly those characters seem Lawful. Similar to the gods above, the alignment lands more on the character’s personal situation rather than the world at large, changed by perspective. 

I don’t personally enjoy D&D much, so I’ve played numerous other systems and very few have alignment systems. Rather they impose other character flaws into mechanics in ways that feel more interesting and fluid, allowing a player to explore “how would my character react” without fearing alignment changes based on vague principles that seem to feel like your entire character has shifted fundamentally over one choice. 

Apologies for the rant, I’ve had many a discussion on alignment and have seen it cause more problems than anything. Use it if you want, obviously, just wanted to vent an opinion to the internet void."

The thing that bugs me in your story is that he was literally willing to pay someone to take your character.
