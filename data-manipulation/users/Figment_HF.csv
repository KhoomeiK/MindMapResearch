There is some massive miscommunication here, I really don’t think it’s my fault though.

I’m not telling anyone how to dress or what they should wear. I’m telling you my shallow preferences. I don’t like strong weight lifting women with powerful muscles either.

I think ultimately I like more traditionally feminine women, with long hair, and clear skin and thin upper arms and little ankles. I like creativity and intelligence. 

It’s just what I like. But I tell you what’s worse than a girl with tattoos and piercings, a girl who wants tattoos and piercings, but doesn’t have them because their bf doesn’t like them.

The most attractive thing a woman be is confident and comfortable in her own skin."

todayilearned,ffqvolz,t1_ffqqvnr,1580144696.0,"What an asinine comment. 

They can look how they want. I just don’t find that particularly attractive. 

Next time a women mentions her preference for a guys shoes or hight or facial hair, be sure to reprimand her for daring to have an opinion."

It’s like some form of cosmic karma"
videos,ffqbkdl,t1_ffqa9ky,1580129360.0,"So, I think you’re somewhat off in how you view videos games as a fake, or false sense of reward. I could describe casual, amateur sports in the same way, there is only a set of predetermined outcomes. It’s only a game. Yes, you might socialise and get some physical fitness, but you can certainly socialise online, and you’re getting metal fitness. 

Games like Dark Souls and Sekiro, are very much skill based and have a real sense of reward. It takes incredible focus and determination, and your reward is unlocking more content. The same can be said about competitive online games, like first person shooters. You don’t arbitrarily get a reward, like a slot machine, you have to earn it by being good at the game. By your logic, something like Chess is also a fake distraction, and maybe in some people’s situations, they are using sports and games as a way to avoid dealing with real world problems.

I feel all sport is a way to fake a feeling of accomplishment that should evolutionarily come from a successful hunt, or a small skirmish with a neighbouring tribe. 

But yes, the online socialisation was probably placating some urge for more genuine, real world contact, in the same way that porn placates an urge for real intimate relationships. 

And slaying a fictional dragon in a game, can give you a rewarding sensation that perhaps stops you from slaying your own real world metaphorical “dragon”."

it’s 5 dollars a month for 120+ hours of entertainment. The monetisation is equivalent to tossing a few coins to a busker you’re really enjoying. 

I wasn’t really going to be doing anything else at 10pm- 1am on a weekday evening. 

I’m sympathetic to your point, but I feel as though it simply made that period more tolerable for me. And anything that’s easing the pain of a bad patch, can be seen as enabling it? 

I don’t know how the counterfactual could have played out. I imagine that I would have just been browsing reddit and watching YouTube, feeling slightly more isolated and lonely than I was with the streams."
JusticeServed,ffq997r,t1_ffq8ob5,1580126798.0,"I got stabbed in the stomach in 2003 at a nightclub. 

Being stabbed feels like being punched at first. You expect to feel the cold knife inside you, and for your muscles to grip it as it’s pulled out. But no, it just kinda pops in and out real fast. It’s feels “odd” more than painful at first. You might even lift up your top and not see the wound till it starts bleeding. 

Anyway, it hurts like fuck a very short while after. It can bruise badly around the entry wound, while it’s healing it hurts to laugh or sneeze or just move."

Look, I can sympathise with your point. Dark and surreal comedian creates full PC safe space and bans all jokes that might be seen as edgy. 

It feels, off? 

But the problem is that you simply can’t know if someone is an actual trump supporting bigot, or just a decent guy making an off coloured joke.

So the solution is a blanket ban on any jokes about gay people, women, blacks, Islamic folk, trans people, etc. Any jokes that can easily be misconstrued as bigoted and punching down. 

It’s also to make all the LGBT people, and other minorities, feel welcome and included, because I can assure you that’s not the case in a lot of Twitch streams, it’s full of those Pepe frog people."
