It's just that underlying those promises was a lot of racist rhetorical dog whistles. It's one thing to say ""I'm going to make you happier, healthier, wealthier, and generally better off."" It's another thing entirely to say, ""I'm going to make you happier, healthier, wealthier, and generally better off by finally acknowledging this country's real problem: Brown people...""

Every politician makes those same promises. What made Trump stand out was that he didn't actually offer any concrete plans or solutions, just a lot of generic vitriol that people could either choose to ignore (""he'll be more presidential after the inauguration"") or buy into (""He's right.

According to Trump's team, the president can't be impeached for anything less than an actual crime. But also the president can't be investigated for a crime while in office. And while it's the senate's job to try him, it's the house's job to investigate. But also, the president has the power to legally obstruct any such investigation.

creepy,fcamjqe,t1_fc9xsnc,1577572211.0,"The best method I've heard of thus far is relying on the capacity of yhe explorer to learn. You don't use any particular language right off the bat, you build one alongside whoever is exploring the storage facility.

For example: you design the holding facility with two paths, one inherently dangerous and one inherently safe, and you mark the dangerous path with a triangle and the safe path with a circle. Do something similar enough times to weed out misinterpretation (triangle can't mean ""sharp edges"" if 4/5 times there are no sharp edges) and now triangle means bad/danger and circle means good/safe. From that point forward, as long as you can preserve the language, you can teach it through basic logic.

Another example was using footprints as directional indicators, but even if you don't think that will work, (say, because you're worried that the explorers might be alien, not human) then you can build a device that has to be moved aside/rolled forwards in order to enter the storage facility. You design it so that it only moves in one direction and either leaves a specific unidirectional print or fits into a specific unidirectional groove as it moves. Now you have a shape that indicates direction which means you can tell your explorer in what order they should read your instructions."
