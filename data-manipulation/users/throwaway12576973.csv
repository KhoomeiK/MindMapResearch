Story time. 4 years ago I HATED my boyfriend. I thought he was an egotistical privileged asshole. I had two dogs at this point of my own, kira and twitch. A pitmix and a husky. My pitmix got attacked by a pack of dogs, and I really couldn't afford the surgery for him. I was asking anyone and everyone to help me with just a few $$ so I could put a down payment on the vet bill.. boyfriend was the LAST person I asked. I was desperate. I was 17$ short of my goal and running out of time. I explained the situation to this giant asshole of a man hoping hed understand because he had a dog. 
He hung up on me. I thought he was being an asshole. But I was so dead wrong. As soon as he hung up on me, he called the vet. He made a payment over the phone with his credit card. He paid the entire bill, and left his card on file for any remaining medical bills.  
He called me back and told me what happened when he got blaze, the dog in these pictures. I cried, he cried, and now 4 years later were dating, love eachother to bits, and our two dogs (my husky twitch and his blaze) love eachother. Kira survived! He went on to be my best friends dog. I would have kept him myself, but my friends lifestyle fit him better than mine did. He's almost 5 now and such a great dog."
