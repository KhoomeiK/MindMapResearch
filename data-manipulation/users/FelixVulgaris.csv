politics,fdkjly4,t1_fdkifcy,1578505054.0,Arnold was straightforward and honest as a republican governor of California. His failings as a governor were mostly related to lack of experience and not understanding how much he depended on the opposition party to get things done; but I don't think there are many people that would call him a dishonest politician.

politics,fdkhyao,t1_fdjrwq7,1578504226.0,"Duncan Hunter is an entitled liar and a crook. That doesn't make this kind of generalization helpful or in any way accurate. 

I realize it gets easy upvotes in this context, but this is exactly the kind of noise that's going to be artificially inserted into the conversation as we get closer to the election. Broad brush generalizations that don't really say much, but get a reaction (negative, positive, doesn't matter as long as it's a reaction). 

Why do the agitator's job for them?"

AskReddit,fdjhmsr,t1_fdisdn7,1578471214.0,"Allright then. I'm a 10 year old account. What criticism do you have of transgender people. 

Also, what exactly do you mean by ""trans ideology""?"
AskReddit,fdjhf6a,t1_fdiayb3,1578470936.0,"Yes, because running the United States is about who can meme the hardest. Are people really this fucking stupid?"

AskReddit,fdjh1bd,t1_fdinmpy,1578470451.0,You really got those libruls. They have vaginas. Gross.
facepalm,fdh2dfq,t1_fdgcwxn,1578413889.0,Me too. There's a deliberate campaign to flood this sub with right-wing ragebait. Hopefully people are calling this out and downvoting consistently.
facepalm,fdh1yyt,t1_fdgt16z,1578413636.0,Let's all tell people we know nothing about how they're doing things wrong!!

LifeProTips,fd3hx8g,t3_ejygse,1578158441.0,"You seem super considerate, and that's a great quality to have in a friend, partner, or coworker. I think what you said shows a lot of self awareness. Instead of letting yourself get resentful because people weren't necessarily appreciating your thoughtfulness, you realized that it's better applied more sparingly for special occasions. 

I'll be damned if that isn't some personal growth. 

Good start to 2020. Keep being awesome!"
AskReddit,fd3fqxj,t1_fczjka4,1578157858.0,"I guess it might make sense if they couldn't tell it was you. If I saw an unidentified someone standing on my neighbors roof without a work-vest and some roofing material, I'd probably assume they were trying to break in."
