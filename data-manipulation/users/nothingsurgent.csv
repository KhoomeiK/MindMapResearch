2. Optimize your marketing/copywriting until campaigns are profitable. 

The key here is figuring out the exact user profile and exactly why they like your app and are willing to pay, then making sure your marketing materials fit them perfectly.

3. Scale."
Entrepreneur,fd4m5zz,t3_ek0fi7,1578168829.0,"1. Create a brand and a story, so that followers feel emotionally connected to you.

In other words, get to a point where they prefer buying from you rather than anywhere else.

2. Sell digital goods. The margins are way better.

3. Build a funnel around the digital products. Get followers off the page and into a newsletter, Instagram acct, and retargeting campaigns where they go through a carefully crafted journey that ends with a purchase. 

4. Use the store as a back-end revenue channel.

The best skill to learn (or hire) in order to do this is copywriting.

People don’t just buy, you need to sell."

Quick tip on making it stick:

Whatever the case is - it’s not your fault.

I’m getting great result from my email list, but ejected I try to use gmail ads they bomb.

I tried taking my best performing newsletters and turn them into gmail ads with no success. 

Part of it is that the gmail ads, other than the title, don’t look like actual emails when you open them.

(Also it’s takes a lot of time to build the body of the ad).

Any advice?"

bipolar,fc82570,t1_fc7svzr,1577524898.0,"You’re aware of it.

That’s the first step and it’s a huge one. It’s not gonna be easy, but once you get over that first time it’s just a bit easier. Then after 2-3 times even easier, and so on. It’s blender really “easy” but easiER.

And bottom line, it’s about how important this is for you.

I think couples therapy is good for every couple, even if they don’t have any issues. But with bipolar i think it’s a MUST. 

People accept that for a profession you need to be trained, I don’t see why for something so important like relationships they try to wing it. Get the help you two deserve."

I agree - it’s not about how much time, it’s about the quality of it.

Most people spend worthless time with their kids. I try to spend as much time w/ them but most importantly I make sure it’s time well spent, where I’m energetic and they are too (or need me the most).

Changing diapers count as quality time for me. Playing, learning, talking, eating.

I see parents suffer through their time w/ their kids, as if they were babysitters who can’t quit. That sucks."

As for the drugs, there are drugs in Disneyland too. 

Drugs in Tomorrowland are almost non existent *compared* to other festivals / live shows.

TML is the next level, ages 20-30.

Makes perfect sense, especially as TML and EDM become more mainstream. 

As far as music festivals and EDM brands go, TML is the cleanest - no drugs (officially.. I’d say there are just as much drugs in Disney world), attention to detail, storytelling based IP.

Disney owns ESPN, and even owns Vice.com... I’d say TML is a better fit than both. 

Also Disney started their own EDM festival at Disneyland Paris, with DVLM headlining. So I’d say they are exploring the audience/market."

2. Of your quality is better in a parameter I don’t care about - it’s not really better.

3. If your quality is better in a way I can understand and assign value to, I will leave a competitor for you.

Example: if your fabric is better it won’t make me buy clothes from you if your competitor’s clothes look better on me. 

However if your clothes look the same, but I know that your fabric lasts longer - it might get me to switch.

The caveat is: I need to *know* that you fabric will last longer than the brand I currently buy my clothes from."
