offmychest,ffy25ia,t3_evrls7,1580337102.0,Just the fact that you can identify the issues already shows you’re on a great path to recovery. There are some that unfortunately never know when’s a good time to put their foot down. I wish you nothing but the best and hope you find the woman you’re looking for within yourself stronger then ever
FoodPorn,ff0tzcp,t3_eqz03g,1579472287.0,Why are these so sexy? I didn’t know I needed them in my life until I saw them
stopdrinking,fepj06g,t1_feph9ak,1579321737.0,Yeahhh I don’t think I’m ready either honestly. Especially feeling like this? It’d be a recipe for disaster if I put myself in that kind of environment right now
stopdrinking,feph1y7,t1_fepgr6t,1579320302.0,"That put things in better perspective for me, thank you! Idk tonight I felt like I was going into that self pity mode like “why would you tell me you’re going out, you know I’m struggling” boo hoo, but I know it’s not their responsibility to watch what they do/say around me. Ultimately I gotta get outta my bratty feelings and stay focused lol"
offmychest,fehwqn7,t3_ep5d4a,1579125391.0,Wtf I’m so sorry you’re going through this
alcoholism,fe66oyt,t3_ennqsa,1578883006.0,"My sponsor told me “the shitty part about being an alcoholic is when we’re not in our right state, we’re selfish and not only do we break the hearts of whoever’s close to us, we break our own in the process.” Give AA a shot. The worst has passed, but better days are coming for you as long as you don’t take that first drink."
alcoholism,fe64zra,t3_enx4sm,1578881910.0,"If you’ve ever gone to AA (it’s not as scary as it sounds) you can always talk to other people who’ve struggled with this. Having a sponsor always helps too. Honestly being able to connect with people who have the same kinda struggle will help you stay on track, and yeah she might think it’s kinda lame at first but your mental/physical health and sobriety should always come first no matter what anyone thinks."

alcoholism,fdn8a8j,t3_em8vma,1578579968.0,Good luck friend! You got this!!!

depression_memes,fdfuuz2,t3_ekvnyz,1578370823.0,That’s just my face...
depression,fdfupcr,t3_ekwbox,1578370705.0,"Same. Definitely not alone at all. I’ve already planned my day tomorrow, just wana have a nice depression sleep and try to be a person on Wednesday."
stopdrinking,fdfruty,t1_fdfrn1d,1578368666.0,"I plan on it. Tired of ruining my life with this but as of right now, I’d like to live under a rock til everyone forgets about my dumbass self"
stopdrinking,fdfql1n,t1_fdfpoti,1578367819.0,"I really appreciate that. Honestly, anyone reaching out makes me feel a little less shitty and a lot hopeful for the future. I just hope the damage I’ve done isn’t irreversible"
LifeAdvice,fdf8wvy,t3_ekw10u,1578356050.0,"When I’m out by myself I’ll usually listen to some music, normally anything acoustic (I think it’s pretty calming) or if I feel a flare up coming I’ll count to 10, take a deep breathe and if I need to go to 20 I’ll repeat and so on. As for being comfortable around people, maybe join a community club, you’d be surprised how many people are trying to be social"
Needafriend,fdbjrf5,t1_fdbgbpl,1578258054.0,"Thank you, I really appreciate that! I hope I find them too"
Needafriend,fdac7e1,t3_eke1qm,1578244449.0,"Yeah... yesterday I went to my first AA meeting so I guess that’s a step in the right direction, but aside from that i get random anxiety attacks throughout the day. I get I have to take responsibility for my actions, I am, but for the first couple weeks I know it’s guna feel like everything’s crumbling around me and it’s fucking terrifying."
Needafriend,fdaa98u,t1_fda6usz,1578243589.0,My problem when things like this happen is I just wana fix them immediately. I don’t go out of my way to purposely hurt people close to me but I know they don’t feel that way about me and I hate leaving things up in the air
Needafriend,fda09zn,t1_fd9r91g,1578240222.0,I completely agree. My only fear is that even if they notice a change they won’t take me back. I’ve been thinking about that for a few days and it’s hard for me to accept that it’s a possibility
offmychest,fd4nifa,t1_fd4mtc2,1578169157.0,Thank you! I really appreciate it
alcoholism,fcz0tcm,t3_ejgep4,1578091383.0,"You’re right. I was thinking of that earlier. Felt like I’ve given my friends and family the same song and dance without any actual proof of getting better for too long. So tomorrow I’m going to my first meeting, I don’t wana tell them til I reach my milestone"
alcoholism,fcym05h,t3_ejgep4,1578082484.0,I looked up some and I’m going tomorrow. I’m a bit nervous about it since it’ll be my first time
alcoholism,fcy6nfl,t3_ejgep4,1578075563.0,Yeah that’s was quite a read indeed but it was also beautiful so say the least. Thank you for taking the time to reach out to me. Every little bit matters and I hope I can eventually be as strong as all of you and build my better life
alcoholism,fcxoef7,t1_fcxmat8,1578067723.0,"Realizing you’re the cause of all the chaos in your life cuts very deep and it’s even worse when you wana fix things with people you’ve hurt because of it and you can’t. I understand I deserve the cold shoulder but I also wana express how sorry I am, I just feel like saying sorry doesn’t fix anything"
alcoholism,fcxnxs1,t1_fcxndm2,1578067425.0,"Judging by how much of a mess I got myself into, it’s time to give it up completely. I’m just scared after months of not touching it I’ll be right back to “what’s the harm, I’ll be fine” kind of mind set. I’m looking for meetings right now. I’ve honestly never been and it kinda scares the shit outta me but I’ve never had anyone to do this with me so maybe it’s what I need."
