news,ffjzxgx,t1_ffjhqwi,1580011598.0,"Even in court the government could still use facial recognition like they use other illegal means to gather evidence. 

They gather the evidence illegally and then use the information they discovered to figure out how they can then obtain it in a legal way. 

And in the case of facial recognition it'd almost be trivial to do that, because in a sense facial recognition actually doesn't do anything that we couldn't do before. It just makes the process really, really, really fast. 

Like if you're looking for a suspect, and you have good reason to believe that he was in the general vicinity of X on one of four days, then you might have hundreds of cameras in the area that you might need to look through, which ends up being thousands of hours of footage. 

If you wanted humans to do it then you'd need an incredibly large amount of manpower to comb through all that footage. It's not practical to do often, only when it's REALLY important.  

But a computer could potentially do the work of thousands of people in a fraction of the time. 

So you have your illegal software find every example of the guy out of all the footage, and you also have actual human beings look through the footage as well.

You can even have the humans find him without them knowing they were guided to it. You just assign them very specific footage to watch, knowing that the footage you selected for them to study (which they believe was selected at random) has a very good chance of them recognizing the suspect."

pcgaming,fdi37uu,t1_fdeqzvc,1578434928.0,"That's not throwing away money, that's a diverse investment portfolio. 

Consider some basic probabilities. 

Let's say Google has 10 different projects they're thinking about starting right now, each of them costing about a million dollars to fund. 

They estimate that each of these has about a 10% chance of succeeding. 

However, for each one that succeeds they expect to make 20 million dollars. 

So it costs 10 million dollars to fund all of them, then they expect 9 of them to flop, one to succeed, and they make 20 million dollars off that one success. 

So they've doubled their money even though 90% of their investments flopped hard.

Once they start a project, and it doesn't work initially like they hoped, that very often means they were wrong about the project in the first place, and it was never going to succeed.

*Sometimes* that's not true, but even if there's still a chance they could make it work, their new estimates for its odds of success are probably significantly lower. 

Now maybe they need to do it over, spend an extra million dollars, but there's only a 5% chance of success. 

That's a 5% chance of making 20 million dollars. On average, if that type of investment costs a million dollars, that's only breaking even. It's not expected to be profitable at all. 

So if a project initially fails, they're going to need a very strong motivation to keep dumping money into it. 

For example, maybe a competitor pops up right at the same time they launch their product. 

If the competitor is a smaller company, and Google knows that it can easily undercut and outlast it, and then dominate the market, then maybe they'll keep the product alive in the long term.

But if they get to market and people simply didn't like or care about the product nearly as much as they expected?

If they think it's a story their readers would be interested in, then it's only natural for them to mention it. It'd be a disservice to their readers to ignore it and risk them never finding out because only one news outlet was reporting it.

As for the copying, I had only skimmed the articles but didn't notice any pasting. I agree that's bad practice."
pcgaming,fcy21j0,t1_fcxyj5t,1578073700.0,">great journalism guys

There's nothing wrong with citing other news sources though.

If a news company wants to be a reasonably comprehensive source of news, then they can't just ignore interesting/meaningful stories. 

It's not like it's possible to have original insight on every conceivable news story. The best they can do is perform their own original research on interesting stories and then also keep track of the media at large so that their readers stay widely informed. 

Not that I'm defending IGN specifically as a good source of news. I'm definitely not. 

But imagine if a big story came out at a single news outlet. They had a secret, insider source and nobody else can find out anything about them.

And let's say this is a highly reputable news outlet. There's practically no way that they're just making something up or misrepresenting information for attention.

Nobody is just going to ignore that big story, but all anybody else can do is basically cite them and repeat whatever information they've already made available.

If anything you should criticize OP for citing this story instead of the original."

Because I can totally see why the developers would want to put a hard limit on turn time to avoid that.

I'm not sure how it'd be possible to differentiate between pointless/stalling endless loops and merely very long combos. 

The only idea that comes to mind is giving abilities more time, but also giving players the ability to report people for obvious infinite combo stalling and create serious repercussions for that kind of behavior."

todayilearned,fckfnrf,t1_fck7ovv,1577724270.0,"I'm merely describing what ""goal-driven"" means. 

Goal-driven is a reference to motivations, which are components of a mind.

Evolution isn't a mind, so it doesn't have motivations, so therefore it isn't goal-driven. 

An individual life form, like a human, can have motivations and can be goal-driven. 

However, a human being is not evolution. Evolution is a description of a natural process that involves all things, even inanimate objects like the sun. Anything that affects the life of even a single life form is part of evolution. 

In the same way, a human being is not gravity. 

One might say that a human being exerts gravity, and is influenced by the gravity of others, but one would not say that gravity has goals merely because one human has goals. In the same way, one would not say that gravity has blonde hair, because some human beings have blonde hair.

Gravity has tendencies, but those tendencies aren't goals. Goals are mental constructs, which obviously necessitates a mind. Gravity, like evolution, isn't a mind."

However, looking at my stats, I seem to do noticeably better on the draw, even across different decks. Some of them 70% win rate on draw versus 40% win rate on play. 

Is that unusual?

My first thought upon noticing this is that I have a habit of not taking a mulligan. And because of that fact, maybe the extra draw helps improve the sub-par hands I'm accepting. 

Should I be reading up on what kind of hands should take a mulligan?

Edit: I'm fairly new to Arena and never kept track of stats when I was playing Magic casually. 

I've mostly been playing with the starter decks, and mostly in casual play, but also with the budget red cavalcade [recommended here](https://mtgazone.com/mtg-arena-budget-standard-decks/) that I made today, playing ranked (23 matches with that deck, just hit Silver 1), the pattern remains (78% win on draw, 43% win on play)."

For example, Bob might buy a hammer for the purpose of building a tree house. 

On the other hand, Jill might then buy the same hammer from Bob, for the purpose of murdering her husband. 

Nothing has inherent purpose beyond that which people ascribe.

In the case of the zen tradition, we're involving a large number of different people over vast periods of time. 

Perhaps some people chose to hang around zen masters for the purpose of becoming wise or holy in some way. Maybe some read texts affiliated with zen because they were dissatisfied with life and just wanted to escape suffering.

And those intentions could easily have changed for those people over the course of their lives.

Some might not have even had any particular intention in mind, as interacting with the zen communities they found just came naturally to them.
