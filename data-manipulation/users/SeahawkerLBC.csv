I get everyone thinks we should pass more with Russell and it's the offensive coordinators job to do that. With so many penalties to be called on passing plays, even if it isn't successful there's a good chance we move the chains with penalties. On running plays, nearly all the penalties go against the offense instead. It makes it even more tilted in favor against running the ball when you have an undisciplined team prone to committing penalties and killing drives.

Seahawks,felnai6,t3_ept76w,1579226261.0,"Another anti-pete discussion, yay....

I get everyone thinks we should pass more with Russell and it's the offensive coordinators job to do that. With so many penalties to be called on passing plays, even if it isn't successful there's a good chance we move the chains with penalties. On running plays, nearly all the penalties go against the offense instead. It makes it even more tilted in favor against running the ball when you have an undisciplined team prone to committing penalties and killing drives. I do think that needs to be changed, I think the offensive coordinator should open the passing playbook up sooner, and I think Pete Carroll should continue to be the coach"
