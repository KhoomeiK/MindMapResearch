Their writing style went from completely incomprehensible to professional quality overnight.

From not being able to define terms to a detailed, well thought out and creative exposition of the chain of evidence.  I spoke to the student, quizzed them on content.  Nothing,  could not support the ideas in paper at all.  Nothing  turned up in Turnitin, etc.  They get one chance here, so I let it go.  The ensuing maelstrom was a PITA, though."

It could be someone who looks similar, coincidentally, it's possible, sure.

But what if it is him? Surely Trump would not send some guy he's only known for a short time to run herd on Rudy, who is a loose cannon at best and a demented alcoholic at worst.  He'd send an old family friend.  The Russians have been cultivating Trump for a long time.  What if there is more to this story than Parnas has told so far?  Maybe he's been running herd on Trump since the 80s?

He was Chinese--not that that is bad, or pertinent, other than his English and comprehension were awful.  He was going to run his own project involving some sort of genetic analysis, I don't recall what it was, other than that.  My boss was a sweet, brilliant man, who expected you to be a jack of all trades--and to master whatever task he had for you quickly.  That's why I liked working for him, you had to teach yourself, and do it fast.  I liked the challenge.

Anyway, this postdoc was pretty much immediately suspect.  He couldn't pour piss out of a boot.  He would refuse to do what our boss wanted him to do, which left me to do it.  He was basically a one trick pony.  He left a -80\* freezer open over a weekend, which ruined all the samples, among other things. Downloaded a virus onto the computer system from a porn site.  I had to have the entire lab's computers wiped and rebuilt. I was stunned--this guy couldn't--or wouldn't--do anything other than these genetic analyses.  I took a look at his dissertation--it was perfect, absolutely flawless.  Conceptualization, implementation, formatting, all professional quality.  There was no way in hell this guy did this work--none.  I concluded he had bought it.  He then falsified some data, because he was doing fuckall in the lab, and he was canned.

politics,fdbehfg,t3_ekdwxk,1578256604.0,"Somebody asked, so I'll summarize his exemplary work in  Indiana /s;

  Hoosier here (Indiana). I wish I could find the link, a fellow Hoosier wrote it out at one point--but here's the TL:DR; This is off the top of my head--

&#x200B;

1. Tried to make it legal for businesses to discriminate against gays. This one caused an uproar--local religious people and businesses raised hell about this. Hoosier philosophy is ""Business as usual""--don't get in the way of that. Scaring people away is NOT how to promote business.  Businesses--big ones--who were considering coming to Indiana for the tax breaks immediately struck Indiana off their list. Everybody was *pissed.*
2. Tried to create a state run ""news"" agency. That is, only news that was sanctioned by the Governor's Office. Uh, no.
3. Turned away desperately needed Federal dollars (millions) for public preschool and primary school education--they had won the grant, were ready to implement--and Pence turned it away because ""Evil Federal money.""
4. Here's a fun one--rammed through a law (since struck down) that made it illegal for women in the third trimester of pregnancy carrying nonviable fetuses to abort.  They had to go through full term and natural birth.  All abortions were to be given a burial at the family's expense. Women were calling the Governor's Office with the monthly dates of their cycles.
5. He was--at one point, anyway--in favor of electroshock therapy for the treatment of ""gayness.""
6. Way back when, he took his remaining campaign money, and paid his mortgage with it.

There's lots more. Even out in the rural areas, way out in the boonies, farmers had signs up ""Fire Pence."" He was on the verge of getting recalled--that's why he fucked off to Washington, he was slated to lose big time here. He always had his sights on Washington.

Even Trump was joking at one point that Pence was a yoyo who wanted to kill all gays. How much you can take that at face value is, of course, suspect. But it doesn't feel good to have the kettle calling the pot black. He's a scary, scary guy."
