The in game promo shit has gone down. They used to give a row a free slice of pizza...now it's a coupon. I get sometimes they're limited by a sponsor (50 bucks off at dufresne furniture? Yay?) But a signed game used stick is something already paid for and utilized by the team, and not all of the ones put out for sale sell, so more shit like that maybe?

It's little things that irritate me more. The free fountain drink from the Bud DD booth used to be open to any game. I'd hoard them (and buy beer instead) when I go with buddies and use them when I take my kids. I stopped drinking Coke for the most part a while back. Fountain drinks have the highest profit margin percentage wise generally. Who cares when you use it? They used to do a bottomless popcorn bowl for 9 bucks, another generally high profit item (and ones with tons of waste when they throw out unsold popcorn) and they got rid of it. It used to be a guaranteed buy from me with the family, and now I just buy a single bag at 4.50 or 6 bucks. Combine the two and it shuts the kids up good. It's not like we're filling that bowl up more than once or twice anyway. Plus I don't do Coke, so if I'm eating that popcorn too, I'm probably buying a beer to go with it.

I know this kind of stuff sounds kinda cheap on my end, but generally I'm a guy that's not gonna spend much anyway. I'll make an evening out of it and hit a restaurant. I actually like the Carvery and think it decent value, but there's no spot to eat it that doesn't risk spillage. I'm not asking for a free Jersey with a sth package, or parking, or free anything. I got an email this year to buy a mini pack and get a free toque. I'm not asking for that. I just feel if I'm paying a hundred bucks a seat that small shit like that feels like they're picking up pennies at the expense of dollars.

As someone who remembers the 80s, the Bombers history since 1994 is very forgettable and occasionally embarrassing. Younger fans only really remember the Joe Mack years, but Lyle Bauer was pretty horrible from a personnel standpoint and how he handled his coaches and the Aspers who were willing to invest and contribute to a new stadium. Let alone the Jeff Reinebold years and Cal Murphy's last two seasons. I was skeptical over Wade Miller's hiring, but the stability he brought with Walters and O'Shea and patience they had was wonderful. Gonna miss Matt Nichols, but I think Zach Collaros brings more to the table than him.

CFL,ff7c2g9,t1_ff7a4zi,1579646041.0,"I don't see how six million is a drop in the bucket for a lot of these teams. Travel in Canada is either expensive or lengthy. The AHL has higher salaries and flies everywhere and they schedule as many back to backs as possible out west. As far as venues, you should use what's there. People who hope for smaller venues in the case of Valour and Forge are dreaming. Especially in the case of Valour. The Bombers own the team and owe money towards the stadium. Nothing smaller is coming for a while. At the most cynical, the team exists to fill dates and pad the Bombers bottom line. Jeff Hunt is part owner in the RedBlacks and was part of the rebuild at TD Place. I wouldn't expect much from him unless there's room for some more redevelopment on the Landsdowne site. And I go back to my example of the Winnipeg Goldeyes. Their new (15 years ago) park is (still) great, but they made hay for a decade in an ill-fitting venue. If you have a benevolent owner who can get a 6k seater, great, but there's no evidence it's good business in the CanPL yet. I think pointing to Halifax's culture is one thing, but truthfully, they have nothing else to support. They have regional basketball and the Mooseheads. Neither of which run concurrently. I understand the NLL is setting up shop, but that is hardly a huge draw. The Bombers and Tiger-Cats have a century of history behind them. Winnipeg has the NHL, AHL and WHL and a well supported baseball team that has 25+ years of history. Hockey aside, there's two other teams Valour competes with. I love soccer, but the super passionate nations behind them really don't support other sports like North American audiences do.

Maybe in 5-10 years when they've had to better establish themselves. I've been to Valour games, while it might be a shitty bus trip, with the cost of tickets (I took 4 of us and payed for parking for the cost of a single Jets ticket) and ample parking (from a CanPL standpoint), if Valour fails, it's NOT on the stadium, it's on the fans. The Winnipeg Goldeyes survived for a decade with a makeshift grandstand at the old Winnipeg Stadium that made you leave the seating area to get concessions. Complete with CFL lines in the field of play. And they operate as the lone Canadian team in an unaffiliated AA-equivalent bus league that stretches as far south as Texas. They're entering their 26th season this year. At IG, you walk up to the concourse and can see the field from the concession line. So yeah, while intimacy is nice, (the Goldeyes have a nice field. I don't think it's practical for soccer what with the shape of the stadium and gravel infield) you should be able to get some use out of existing venues in a league with a sport that has no tradition here."

There's a reason the CHL has three regional leagues. We all know about the stadium issues for the Atlantic Schooners and they're not even trying to do much for a facility. There's a reason why Wanderers grounds are converted shipping containers with scaffolding instead of an actual building. It doesn't make for the greatest atmosphere, but at least Valour and Forge make extra use of the existing facilities. IG Field is a great venue, even if it is cavernous when you only get 6k for soccer."

Anecdotally, I got a ticket once on the highway that I was certain he was wrong. I was in a work vehicle, getting paid hourly, no way do I speed in that situation. I generally drive 5 under because I get in shit from the office as well as the ticket. Any way, A pickup truck blew past me, and I assume he was pointing at the him and just gave me the ticket because the other guy was long gone. Turned out he never calibrated the gun, (required daily) and it had not issued a ticket for 9 days prior. They threw out the ticket. If I had admitted to speeding, I would have been in the hook regardless of the calibration status.


In Canada, never pay your ticket right away. Go meet with the court, get the police report and proceed from there. At the very minimum, it gives you time to set aside cash to pay the fine, at best the cop fucked the equipment or something and it gets tossed. Only works if you're not a menace though.

If it's potentially life threatening, or points to a condition that is liveable but could be life threatening (i.e diabetes) you'll get in pretty quickly. Pain is tough because if the doctor doesn't have reason to suspect neurological damage or risk of further damage (Achilles tendon with OP's heel maybe), and they think that ultimately the treatment is little more than meds or physio, it's low priority. Unfortunately there isn't much than can be done for certain types of pain.

It's perfectly reasonable to ask higher rates for a few hours in the evening to go to a show or something, but daycare is a different beast. The current going rate in my Canadian city is $50/day/child at an unlicensed home daycare (perfectly legal here). Providers are allowed up to 4 kids before requiring extra help. And this being Canada, mothers get up to 18 months maternity leave. When my kids were daycare age, we seriously considered to have my wife stay home and operate a home daycare, because paying those rates suck. We didn't do dates for years because of babysitter rates. I'm actually curious what happens in the US without these protections. If daycare rates are genuinely that high, I'm actually surprised that there are so many 2 income homes.
