I’ve used him pretty regularly since 2017 and he’s always been above the board with me. But, that’s just my experience. I’m not in any way discrediting anyone who has made an allegation against him. 

In regards to the photoshop, I guess that’s just personal preference. I like the professional photos I take quarterly to look more stylized than the casual content I release weekly on Twitter."

SexWorkersOnly,ff2x3qm,t3_era1eo,1579527376.0,"This is scary. But, here are a few ways to avoid cameras. Obviously, this doesn’t work for everyone because all SWer’s are different and work differently. But, these few steps work for me. 

1. Screen if you have the ability to. Clients who agree to screening before meeting are more likely follow instructions after you meet irl, when it matters. 

2. Entertain in your own space. It’s not always possibe. But, it greatly reduces the possibility of cameras in the room if you can swing it. 

3. Make everyone shower at the beginning of the appointment - even only if briefly. This forces all clients to remove their glasses and clothing which eliminates the possibility that they can hide cameras on their person. 

4. While your client is in the shower, put their things in a drawer and or closet. I usually don’t inform them of this step. I just do it. This way, any cameras they may have been hiding in their belongings have an obstructed view and are essentially rendered useless."

OldSchoolCool,fdetaf4,t1_fdesbi1,1578346149.0,"Sure. But, we both know that the demographics of this website are heavily male and heavily white.  That's a rather limited population of people. That's also the same group of people who are the least negatively affected by rape culture - which this joke is based in."
OldSchoolCool,fderyvv,t1_fderrf1,1578345366.0,"That's the entire point that I'm trying to make. There's an entire population of people out there who will interpret the joke this way. I understood what the joke was *attempting* to convey. However, the wording totally missed the mark and landed the joke right on the train to Rape City

Edit: It was a poorly worded, poorly executed, pretty rapey joke"
OldSchoolCool,fderbhw,t1_fdeqorn,1578344982.0,"I thought it was a common trope that everyone was familiar with. Have you never heard of anyone say ""dont' explain the joke""? 

Whether you find it in poor taste or not is your personal opinion, but saying "" he doesn't try to sleep with someone he just does"" sounds like a sexual situation that doesn't involve consent from both parties. Much like rape."

OldSchoolCool,fdepzng,t1_fdep8tl,1578344194.0,"In my opinion, the joke wasn't complicated to a number of readers. It was just a low hanging fruit of a joke that was made in pretty poor taste. 

I feel that the mark of a good joke is a joke that appeals to almost everyone. Based on the comment thread, this joke doesn't fit that criteria."
OldSchoolCool,fdeoce3,t1_fdek0fj,1578343237.0,"No. If multiple people have a problem with the joke, the joke was insensitive. It was a shit joke that was kind of rooted in celebrity entitlement and rape culture.

Edit: To be fair, there's an entire thread of people who don't agree that your joke was in any way funny. I get it. You're someone who thinks that PC = bad. You can't be troubled with the ramifications of certain rhetoric because those ramifications have nothing to do with you. Right on."

OldSchoolCool,fdec46d,t1_fdebhgb,1578335784.0,"No. If you would've said that the joke wasn't rapey because the leader or the Red Hot Chilli Peppers is hot, likeable, and charismatic then that would've supported your argument. But, you literally only cited the fact that he was the lead singer of a famous band as to why the joke wasn't rapey. The implication there is literally that leader of band = not rapey. It's right along the lines of ""when you're a star, you can do what you want...you can grab her by the pussy"""

politics,fd5aepu,t1_fd53ng4,1578175694.0,"I'll try to say this more clearly and supply more detail. Whether you feel that she's acting unprofessionally is a matter of opinion. However, Dr. Lee's statement indicating that Nancy Pelosi could, as a co-worker, seek to place him on a 72 hour hold isn't unethical. The Goldwater rule is an APA rule that applies only to it's members. Dr. Lee is not a member of the APA therefore, by nature, she doesn't have to adhere to their code of ethics. Furthermore, being a member of the APA and adhering to their ethics isn't required to be an ethical, competent, or professional psychiatrist. They are just one organization out of hundreds. Another prominent psychiatric organization, the APsaA, doesn't even have a Goldwater rule and isn't seeking to implement one.

Edit: Moreover, Lee hasn't made any diagnoses and is actually a proponent of the Goldwater rule. She just believes that the duty to warn supercedes the Goldwater rule in this case. I don't find that to be unprofessional or unethical. Just controversial to some. However, alot of controversial things are completely necessary."
politics,fd4uvza,t1_fd4p3zf,1578171285.0,"Well, the grounds for a 72 hour psychiatric hold are facts - not opinions. What I personally disagree with is your characterization of this doctor's call for a mental evaluation. Because it seems largely based in your opinion of her as a hack.

Edit: So, I guess I can say that I disagree with your opinion because that opinion seems biased which reduces the quality of your statement. Thank you."
politics,fd4nw5i,t1_fd4k4hi,1578169295.0,"I'm downvoting you because I disagree that this psychiatrist's current actions constitute a violation of the Goldwater Rule. In many ways, she appears to be using sensationalized diagnoses to sell books. But, the fact remains that just days ago the POTUS has unnecessarily engaged in behavior which places many others in grave danger. Both legally and ethically, that action meets the criteria for an involuntary 72 hour psychiatric hold in any state that allows 72 hour holds. Those are just the facts of the situation."
