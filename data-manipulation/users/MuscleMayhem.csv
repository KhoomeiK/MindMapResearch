exchristian,fcsy5bo,t3_eif2iu,1577928050.0,"People wouldn't know unless they suffer themselves. I've doubted God's existence before because of how fucked up he made my mind. It's not my fault, I was WIRED to be this way. The pastor's point seems more illogical when you bring up the fact of there being multiple medicines to solve this condition"

bipolar,fck8j2u,t1_fck7oro,1577719504.0,"You're not alone, I heard some antidepressants switch depressed bipolar people to manic almost instantly. That's why a mood stabilizer is recommended with an antidepressant for bipolar from what I've researched"

bipolar,fcb2yqe,t3_egme5s,1577581626.0,"I had an intense mixed manic breakdown a week ago, had to be sent to the hospital. Can definitely relate with how bad it can get. My mom informed my work and was supportive like yours too, plan to go back after my outpatient program (they also put me on temporary disability which is nice)"
bipolar,fcb2258,t3_egy9gy,1577581216.0,"I get mixed mania the most, so I understand what you mean. Sometimes I get so hyped up, my bad memories start to race out of control, and my anger could get high when mixed, it feels like so much fun but I hate it."
