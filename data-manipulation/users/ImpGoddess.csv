AskReddit,ffa78io,t3_es53p0,1579729238.0,"When they can't carry a conversation. I understand being an introvert, I am painfully aware of it being an introvert myself. I'm usually the one that just sits back and watches other people have a conversation and interjects at times. That being said, if an introvert is trying desperately to have a conversation with you and you can't even be bothered to put some effort into responding after said introvert has already given you several topics to work with, it gets very boring very quickly.
( personal experience, guy who said that he wanted to be friends with me couldn't really handle a conversation one on one.)"

I don't necessarily agree with the last part, especially for abusive situations, but I do I have to say that my boyfriend is my prince, my world, my everything. And he can be my ATM if he wants XD mom's just going to have to take a backseat if she feels that way."
