AMA,ffezj8v,t3_et5itw,1579871398.0,Both my parents died in my 20s and I definitely feel like an orphan. Especially when they weren’t here to meet my husband or see me reach any other adult milestones. I think anyone without parents at an age when pretty much everyone still has theirs is an orphan.

MrsMaisel,feexdd9,t1_feak25c,1579043279.0,"I think it’s a totally fair observation.  I think a big part of why her character, as the protagonist, is brave/daring is because she is not focused on her children during an era when women were expected to only focus on their homes and not their careers. I do think it was pretty typical though for wealthy women to leave their children with nannies in that time and throughout history."

The scene in the first episode where they are playing “the game” may also speak to his complex with humiliation. He invited that child to join the game teasing him with a million, then humiliated him in front of his parents."

SuccessionTV,fdnz594,t3_embnnm,1578595802.0,"I think Roman’s relationship to his father and the bullying he received from his siblings as the youngest son contributed to him having a fetish where he can’t climax unless something is “wrong” or taboo about it. For example, they show him cum in the office on the window (taboo because he could have caught) and he is aroused and cums from Gerri berating him. His attraction to her is taboo because of the age difference and her being his god mother. 

In the story about the “dog kennel”, Connor and Kendall explain to Roman that he LIKED it and was asked to be put in the dog cage, and I think this hints at a humiliation fetish.  He also asked to be sent to military school, again welcoming punishment.  He also decides to pick up Tabitha who he meets when she sucked Tom off in the club.

Roman has some complicated sexual baggage."
AMA,fdlan4y,t1_fdju7cm,1578519979.0,"I felt that way my entire life, since childhood, and tried a ton of antidepressants at different times but continued to suffer. I finally found one that worked and have been on it for 4 years now. It has changed my life. My lows are way less low and my anger doesn’t result in rages anymore. It can take a lot of time and patience, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel!"

brighteyes,fcv0djq,t3_eimyyz,1577992088.0,"I’ve seen Conor 8 times since 2004. The last, I have to say, was pretty awful. He was way too wasted and sang some weird joke song about jerking off. Tim Kasher, who I’ve also seen a number of times as Good Life and Cursive, did the sloppiest opening set I’ve ever heard at a Conor show. It was my husbands first time seeing either and it was pretty disappointing. I hope next time he tours he doesn’t overbook himself. He seemed exhausted and really unhappy to be there."
