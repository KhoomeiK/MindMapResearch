aww,fc63qb6,t3_eg94i5,1577471581.0,"for everyone saying I hope they're rescues, you know the odds of adopting 4 different rescues with clipped ears if very unlikely. Not impossible, but unlikely. Having 4 different dogs ears cropped for recurring ear infections is also very unlikely. Cropping all your dogs ears like an  asshat for the look is the most likely reason. OP care to let us know how these beautiful doggos ended up looking like this?"
