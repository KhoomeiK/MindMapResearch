Average life span of a cow is 25 years, brought down to 5 because we want to milk the shit out of it and cause her to die young.

Average life span of a chicken is 7 years, brought down to 42 days because you'll want chicken nuggets and eggs. 

Average lifespan of a dolphin is 30 to 70 years, with little to no human contact, and they developed a brain, conscience and a way of communication.

Also, there are far more interesting species that thanks to evolution (that we tempered with cause of farms) developed awesome traits, such as the possibility to bring cells back from the dying stage in the immortal jellyfish (Turritopsis dohrnii)


So no, livestock is not even close to be the most successful species in the world, not even remotely close. If we manage them right instead of forcing them to produce products and killing them after 1/5 or even less of their lifespan they might."
