Btw, I'm not arguing against defining it as a disease. I'm not sure I would have a better one. I'm saying that the medical establishment essentially agrees with her. 

I personally think it's absurd, but my opinion doesn't matter much."

cursedcomments,ff2njxc,t3_er9tuy,1579514955.0,Wasn't cream pie supposed to be the euphemism? Is using the word for its literal meaning now a sign of old age or lack of dankness?
blursedimages,fembcz2,t1_felszd6,1579247088.0,"I'm sure nazism would have been great if it wasn't for all that nasty genocide stuff.

Having actually lived in a communist country, I find your views on communism highly offensive. Go talk to some victims."
science,fejafcy,t1_fehi8an,1579164079.0,"Best? In what sense? Least unlikely?

I mean, first you didn't understand the part about the study about the circadian rhythm and now you obviously doesn't even understand the very simple text I wrote you attempted to shame me with.

I'm not sure what your problem is, but I don't care either. Discussion closed."
fatlogic,fdkj9ge,t1_fdkhrir,1578504882.0,"You haven't actually looked into the cited articles, have you? What does that have to do with him being a vegan? From where I'm standing, it looks to me like he has studies, you have a shouty mouth."
fatlogic,fdkb7h0,t3_elmd0h,1578500186.0,"There's actually good scientific proof that it matters when and which calories are being eaten. Biovailability and your circadian rhythm both seem to influence the amount of energy your body takes out of a meal, so it's not nearly as simple as you guys make it out to be.
