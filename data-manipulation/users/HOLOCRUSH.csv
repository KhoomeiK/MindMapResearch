povertyfinance,ffiuyci,t3_etssn6,1579983356.0,"I started donating recently. My center is open 7 days a week. I can go twice a week. It’s been a good experience. I make $300 a month with it. Make sure you eat a balanced meal before you go and be hydrated. After, they tell me to eat ASAP and drink more fluids than normal over the next 24 hours and no heavy lifting with that arm. I have mild fatigue after and I am a bit hungry. It’s no big deal. The time it takes varies on how busy it is and the amount they take depends on your weight and the amount varies how much you are paid. I go in, answer some questions on a kiosk that verifies my identity, then I get in the vitals line and have my weight, blood pressure, temperature taken and they prick my finger and take a little blood to check hematocrit and protein. Then I get in the line to donate. Once I’m in the chair, the donation takes about an hour. The first time I went it took all freaking day literally because I had to answer a million questions, see a nurse, and have a physical in addition to the normal steps. I would not do it on a day I had to get to something else after because if it’s super busy and they are short staffed, it can take awhile. 

But it isn’t a bad experience at all and that money definitely helps. the amount you get will vary by center and what deals they have going at the time."
