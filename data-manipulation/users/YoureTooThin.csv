sugarfree,ffex28o,t3_et05av,1579869002.0,"Fruits and veggies will taste shockingly good once you’ve cut out sugar for a while (ymmv).

My diet used to be kinda similar to yours when I was a teen... But you’re still young, so don’t fret about it being too late to make changes. I would tackle one thing at a time.

Maybe work on eating better before the sugar. Like, try eating more lean proteins and whole grains (brown rice, oatmeal?), more fruits and veggies. Then I would focus on the sugar. When you employ too many big changes at once, it’s harder to sustain."

fatlogic,ff5xpu4,t1_ff5rvm5,1579613684.0,"Same. I only have one ovary left and chronic pain, too. I have to laugh when FAs go on about how being disabled apparently makes it soooo hard to lose weight. You don’t even have to exercise, just eat less!"
sugarfree,ff5we2s,t3_ersyld,1579612490.0,"I’ve had to go all or nothing too. I seriously cannot help myself around candy, so I absolutely cannot have it in the house. I’ve been off sugar since last summer with a few major binges/relapses, and after a binge, it is harder to stay off sugar. In those cases, for a few days after, I avoid fruits or sweet vegetables like carrots, sweet corn or sweet potatoes. Then it gets a little easier again, but it’s still really hard for me to look at all the delicious candies and snacks in stores and stuff (all this Valentine’s Day chocolate is kind of killing me...)

I was also a smoker and on benzos for many years, and I’ve found dropping sugar at least as challenging as quitting smoking, perhaps somewhat more. Unlike smoking these days, sugar is everywhere and in everything and very normalized/socially accepted, which makes it much tougher.

The best thing you can do is get all the sugar out of the house. Maybe lay off fruit for a good while too, but make sure you eat your vegetables to compensate. Try to adopt some new, healthier habits, because IME, I spent years ditching one addiction just to replace it with another (probably another reason ditching sugar has been so hard for me, since I’m trying not to do that). Try not to be too hard on yourself for failing or relapsing... This IS a hard addiction to quit.

Good luck!"
sugarfree,ff5vkz6,t3_erq9c2,1579611743.0,"Benefits:
- food tastes better overall
- fruit tastes so much better and is actually sweet and very satisfying imo, even fruits like berries that are less sugar compared to a pear or apple
- skin looks better
- just feel better overall
- makes losing weight an absolute cinch. I lost 20 lbs in 6 weeks without even trying
- if you’re already logging food in an app like MyFitnessPal, it’s easy to track the sugar you’re still consuming from fruit/veg
- better for your health!!! especially if you have any chronic conditions

Challenges:
- yup, sugar is in EVERYTHING. Even things you wouldn’t think: sauces (ketchup, dressing, tomato sauce), processed prepackaged foods, bread, cereal... Gotta get used to constantly reading labels.
- people think you’re crazy, because, again, sugar is in everything and it’s very normalized.
- when you want the very occasional sweet treat it will probably taste terrible.
- if you are addicted to sugar like I was (always had a major sweet tooth, drank a soda a day), this is not going to be easy. I’ve been doing this since last summer and have fallen off the horse maybe 10 times and gone on insane sugar binges that always left me feeling sick and terrible. But I just couldn’t help myself sometimes. So, if this happens to you and you relapse, don’t beat yourself up over it, just try again tomorrow! It will get easier over time. (However, I will say, over time, my binges went from ice cream/whipped cream to fruit, so... a step in the right direction at least?)
- sugar is everywhere and very tempting ): if possible, get it all out of the house."
fatlogic,ff2yag2,t3_er9ovn,1579528480.0,"It’s really sad how the concept of self-care has become so bastardized. Fueling your food/sugar addiction to “get through the day”? Self-care. Eating past the point of fullness? Self-care. (Of course, cigarettes/booze/drugs/other addictive behaviors never fall under this category...)

Self-care is supposed to mean things like minimizing stress, eating right, physical activity, reaching out to other people instead of isolating yourself. It’s not just doing whatever the hell you want to do to make yourself feel good in the immediacy."
fatlogic,ff2vx43,t1_fez9lso,1579526190.0,"Interesting, it was my endocrinologist too who was the only one to suggest I lose ~10 lbs (was on the higher end of healthy BMI at the time). I thought she was nuts, but losing that and a little more has been helpful for my chronic conditions. I think it has to do with the fact that a lot of her patients are T2 diabetics, so she doesn’t beat around the bush.

Too bad about the nutritionist though."
fatlogic,fedv884,t1_fedpvof,1579020606.0,"I used to feel this way before I started making my veggies tastier by using herbs, especially fresh herbs.

You also have to find the vegetables you really like. Try some new and different things rather than same old carrots and peas."
sugarfree,fe98t8q,t3_enxtvs,1578935443.0,"I have endometriosis, an inflammatory disease, and yes cutting out sugar (except fruit) has drastically lessened my pain (as well as eating an anti-inflammatory diet generally)."
fatlogic,fe5kwny,t3_enrv5n,1578870739.0,"I’ve been encountering more and more reviews of this nature on Amazon (though typically more comprehensible). Most recently was for a coat. Reviewer said arms were too tight. Reviewer was a short, 200-pound woman. So she gave the coat a 1 star review because she was too fat for normal coat sleeves."
sugarfree,fe3z72z,t3_enhemq,1578854225.0,"Yeah, it tastes seriously disgusting after you’ve been off it a while (about a week for me). I tried having a little whipped cream once (one tablespoon, just 1g sugar!), and it was so, so gross. I am ashamed to admit I used to sometimes binge on a whole can.

I mean it’s a good thing overall, but I’ve always had a sweet tooth and would like to have a piece of candy or something once in a blue moon. It is very similar to how one cigarette is just disgusting and not pleasurable to me at all since I quit smoking five years ago."

fatlogic,fdl6igr,t3_elygij,1578517882.0,"There’s something so sad about this, like this resignation that she knows deep down she probably won’t live as long as she would if she weren’t so obese but hopes her kids will remember her fondly, which is such a weird and narcissistic thing to say.

Reminds me of this ep of Secret Eaters I saw today... When the woman of the couple was faced with all the crap she ate throughout the day, she ending up crying because she was so upset about not *being there for her kids*. She was worried about *them*, not about them remembering her for being cool or whatever – I mean what the hell is that lol."
fatlogic,fdjoq0v,t3_elr24m,1578481217.0,"I really hate this sort of thing for a number of reasons. Firstly because I don’t find the mockery of feminism by men cute, ever. Which is not the same as sincere critique. That is something I think is necessary of virtually everything, feminism included, because the thing is, it is a huge problem how HAES & fat activism has infiltrated modern feminism. It’s not feminist to feed women lies about our health when so many of us in the Western world are overweight & obese and are harming ourselves with our terrible diets & sedentary lifestyles. It *hurts* women."

fatlogic,fd287o8,t3_ejmji3,1578143236.0,"Your kids probably *will* be fat, since fat parents tend to have fat kids (because they teach them their terrible eating habits). Hope you like your kids ending up with obesity-related health problems “just like you” too."

fatlogic,fcmxr9i,t1_fcmvj2p,1577796871.0,I’m afraid this might be the route I have to go down too. My parents will just never listen otherwise. Tact and sensitivity just doesn’t seem to work for people intent on harming themselves.

fatlogic,fc8pvzb,t1_fc6pw0t,1577539830.0,"I’ve dealt with chronic fatigue most of my life. I have never been overweight. I was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s disease (hypothyroidism) at 14, though I wasn’t properly medicated til 20 (with Armour Thyroid/natural thyroid hormone extract as opposed to Synthroid). Fortunately it is pretty easy to test thyroid hormone levels. You could also ask to be tested for adrenal fatigue. 

Other things that helped me:
- kicking caffeine and all stimulants (but if you do drink caffeine, try not to drink any 6-8 hours before bed *at the very least*, ideally much earlier)
- practicing good sleep hygiene, going to bed/waking up at the same time (also try to avoid blue light from screens 1-2 hours before bed, or download f.lux & grab some orange glasses on Amazon – trust me it’s a lifesaver lol).
- exercising *during the day* (or at least a few hours before bed)
- avoiding getting overstimulated or socializing too much (am on the autism spectrum)

Chronic fatigue can be a huge pain. Wishing you luck sorting it out."
fatlogic,fc1eq5s,t3_eflq5l,1577316549.0,"I don’t know that saying “being healthy is better” really implies morality tbh. I am chronically ill & have chronic pain and am very acutely aware every day of my life that it would be better to be healthy. And obviously it’s not a moral failing on my personal behalf that I’m not.

Yet it would seem that in the context of health and excess weight, these people hear “being healthy is better” and think “oh so you’re saying it’s my fault I’m obese because I’m a glutton????? how dare you!!!” Which is jumping the gun and drawing inferences that aren’t really there...

It does frustrate me though, and makes me sad, because these people *could have health.* They just... choose not to? (Or, they have food addictions/BED – and have duped themselves into thinking that’s fine and normal thanks to HAES rhetoric.) I just can’t help being amazed at people who carelessly disregard their own health when I’d do *anything* to be healthy. I guess people just take things for granted."
