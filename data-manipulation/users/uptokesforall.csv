Of course their music sounds different, my point was that it's not her age that has me dislike her music. Yeah she's got some earworm hooks but I'm inclined to think she's like ke$ha. Brilliant in her own right but 100% manufactured music."

PublicFreakout,ffh6x2z,t1_ffgt0q2,1579924810.0,"I can see rationale for getting people to stop congregating in that area. Karen probably went straight to ""kick everyone out"" instead of explaining the issue. Still, getting wrapped up in showing up a rent-a-cop is a shitty thing to do. It's understandable that people felt indignant enough to do so but that doesn't legitimize their indecency.

Everyone sucks here, even if the mall cop sucks the most."
PublicFreakout,ffh603x,t1_ffh4nr6,1579924066.0,"Don't people have better things to do than make fun of someone doing what they think their job is? Sure, she was incompetent and exerting authority beyond her reach, but wow that crowd was dangerously disrespectful. When she felt her authority was not respected she needed to accept the dangerous position she was in.

 Mall cop should have left and called the police about the people gathering on the malls outer road. That fight in the end it's proof enough that she shouldn't have stuck around. Authority is in the eyes of the beholder and claiming a position of authority where you have no respect is dangerous. If the biker got angry in that fight she could have really hurt the mall cop and the crowd would have just watched. (The one guy who showed up randomly broke up the fight but wasn't part of the original crowd)"
