Miscarriage,ffih4ok,t3_etojl7,1579973744.0,"You're not alone in this. I had experienced this when I had my miscarriage. I think that after seeing how amazing my boyfriend had been and how he was always there for me, that might have been it? The experience brought us closer and I was really grateful that something so terrible didn't drive us apart. It was pretty confusing as my body was a mess and I was in hospital, but there isn't anything wrong with it, and it's more common than you think."

I had a small cut on my palm at work one time, and it was really hard to work."
KingOfAvalon,ffic5ww,t3_eqr2fz,1579970370.0,I'm looking for an alliance to join as the one that I'm currently in aren't really online anymore. I'm active as much as I can be.
Miscarriage,ffejugr,t3_et2he8,1579851002.0,"You wouldn't have needed to go to the hospital. As most women that have an early miscarriage are told to stay home and only go to the doctors if the bleeding gets worse. You need to tell your mother to do her research, as it is a very serious thing to accuse someone of faking a miscarriage. I'm so sorry for your loss."
