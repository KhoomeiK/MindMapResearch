Beatmatch,ff3qzb5,t1_ff3ov5m,1579546961.0,"Tempo obviously first and foremost, beat phrasings as well as melodic phrasings need to jive, and use any dramatic transitions to your advantage to cut into/out of.  It's just grinding out the practice keeping these things in mind and you will become a ninja at it.    

One last thing, if you're beatmatching/syncing two tracks it can be a good thing for one of them to have a void, such as the two in your post - it gives less opportunity for their melodies to collide and create dissonance in that range.  So you can use these ""empty"" tracks to your advantage in that manner."
Beatmatch,ff3o73a,t3_ergwvo,1579545259.0,"Some tracks just don't want to work together no matter how hard you try.  But, if you really like the flow of certain spots of the mix, try cutting each of them out all the different available transitions left in the tracks.  

If I was doing a hard cut out of PRA; I would first try [right after ""Hey!"" before the chorus drops](https://youtu.be/KQ6zr6kCPj8?t=187), and cut to one of the measures of DK right [where the accordion comes in](https://youtu.be/7zp1TbLFPp8?t=67)  The empty space you're talking about has to be the void left from the huge synths in PRA, and the only active thing DK has in that range is that accordion riff.

I just wanted to point this out because what makes him such an outstanding fighter seems to be that he bucks most systems and takes only what he likes from them to suit his own style, and changes techniques (as did Bruce Lee).

Aquariums,fdrbwob,t1_fdqv863,1578682301.0,"True to all of that, but I mainly mean that pet stores selling the products should do more to educate people before selling (pamphlets explaining how to be a responsible fish owner would be huge).  Most people have no idea that there is any sort of learning curve or that it takes actual work, and make an impulse buy.  When I first got into the hobby about 3 years ago, I told the ""fish expert"" at Petco this was my first tank ever (10 gal) and they set me up with TWO blood parrot cichlids, a bottle of quick start, and a pamphlet for betta care (which was also full of misinformation), which obviously was a disaster after a few months.  It took that for me to even begin to fully grasp the nitrogen cycle, and honestly I'm still learning new stuff about it all the time.  

I have yet to find a comprehensive beginner guide that isn't either too dumbed down or too complex to hand a teenage kid and expect them to fully understand everything they need to know and why, to keep a healthy tank.
