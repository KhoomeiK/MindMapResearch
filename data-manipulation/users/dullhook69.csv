selfharm,fczdrya,t3_ejnxen,1578098927.0,"What a lot of people don't know about self harm is that it's an addiction and really similar to how people get addicted to other things such as achohol or drugs.

It all starts with one cut. When people self harm they are trying to escape emotional pain but what they don't realize is that when you cut your brain realeses seratonin and dopeamine. This gives you a sort of natural high without you even knowing it so even if you have no need for self harm your body still can be addicted to that feeling."

selfharm,fc7460c,t3_egiplm,1577497055.0,"What a lot of people fail to recognize is that breaking a self harm addiction starts with first being accepting about everything about you and around you. You need to be at peace with yourself. You also need to be at peace with how what you are going through will affect you throughout the rest of your life.

Only then can you quit self harming.

This isn't easy I wish you the best of luck and stay safe."
selfharm,fc7393p,t3_egjnqx,1577496360.0,It's an addiction. You start out trying to relieve the emotional pain with physical pain but then you become dependant on pain to function. When that happens you become addicted.

Firstly it's highly addictive and anyone who has done it even for a little while will agree.

Secondly,(this is the most important reason) it will put you in a downward spiral into pain and suffering and if you already are going through these feeling it will only worsen them 10 fold.
