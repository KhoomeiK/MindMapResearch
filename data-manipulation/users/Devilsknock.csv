depression,fefe4ia,t3_eovl5w,1579054375.0,"Comes and goes. Most the time I'm just apathetic to people and struggle feeling sympathy for others but I get these kind of manic depressive episodes where all I can think about is how much I hate myself, writing suicide letters, and contemplating suicide. I normally am either pretty bed ridden in that state or I just pace around for hours on end. When it ends I just go back to being apathetic and isolate myself from people."
depression,fefd1d7,t3_eov3tz,1579053684.0,"Quite a few. I guess some of my go to ones are: Broken and This Road Alone by C-mob, Is Happiness just a Word? (I'd recommend the remix if you listen to it) by Vinnie Paz, Bars for my Brother by Lowkey, We Die Too and Suicidal Thoughts by Iamjakehill, I'm Sorry by Joyner Lucas, Until Then by Prozak, Happiness by Token, Beneath the Stars by Twisted Insane, Voices by Kamikazi, Long Road Home by Twiztid, Hall of the Lonely and Losing My Mind by Lo Key, and Impatient by Dubbs. It's all rap but each song is pretty varied sound wise. They are all either about depression, mental illness, or suicide though. Broken is my favorite song. Bars for my Brother is a pretty damn deep song about his brother that killed himself."
depression,fef52og,t3_eou8ua,1579048367.0,For me it's mainly music focused around depression/death. The fact that depression effects even people who are much more successful than me helps a bit.
depression,fec89cv,t1_fe4ctbd,1578968374.0,"You definitely aren’t alone man. Your story resonates with me pretty heavily as it sounds like pretty much my entire middle-school through high school experience. I don’t know if I can really give that great of advice as I thought I got over it but now it just kind of hits me randomly and throws me into near manic depressive states. I’m 22 now btw, tried college but ended up failing out which just made more depressed so I just told people I dropped out. Can’t honestly say much has changed for me since high school. I guess getting out of the school environment made me less depressed in general but I think my main issue is jealousy for what others have. I see people being happy with loads of friends/SO/etc and that will normally set off one of those depressive states from earlier that I mentioned. Funny cause it’s so easy to talk about this behind anonymity but very few if any people that know me know that I feel this way.

Your latest edit is also pretty interesting to me, during high school, I found a decent way to numb the pain was seeing the suffering of others. I don’t think I would recommend trying that route, I half went into homicidal thoughts there instead of just suicidal. I did manage to avoid those though and now I’m pretty fucking apathetic from that whole time of doing that up until I get another breakdown again and have to coax myself into not blowing my head open. Hell, my grandma that I used to visit all the time as a child died and when face to face with her corpse, I felt absolutely nothing. Felt awkward as hell since everybody else was crying.

All in all man, I’m not sure what to tell you except that there are other people suffering through the same thing and my experience was almost the same as yours. I suppose my life did get better out of school in general but it’s still a far cry from a “happy ending”. I want what others have but I feel I’ve made myself so apathetic and uncaring that it is something I can never get.

Isolating myself is generally what seems to work the best for me but that comes with it’s own issues.

Edit: I guess to elaborate more on the jealously part, it's not exactly social contact necessarily, more that they have an actual reason to get up and keep going with their life. Most people I think tend to go through some form of depression or at least sadness but I feel most have something that they look forward to in life. I don't. I'm sure someday I'll just end up another statistic to the silent killer known as depression while most people that knew me get to say the classic line of ""well, he was joking and seemed happy most the time, who would have known he would have killed himself""."
