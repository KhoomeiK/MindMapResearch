BigIsland,ff85orm,t1_ff85ekv,1579666697.0,Waipio valley as suggested below is amazing but you reallyyyy shouldn‚Äôt take your car down there. We had a friend who lives on the island drive us down. You can always hike it. Rainbow falls is super close to Kaumana caves. Akaka falls is just north of Hilo and had a nice park with trail to walk.
BigIsland,ff85ekv,t3_es6dz7,1579666470.0,"We just got back from the big island a few days ago... spent a few a nights in an AirBnb in Pahoa and there is essentially nothing to do in that area. We used it as a base to explore Hilo and volcano.. but you might want to try and find some specific activities to do. ‚ÄúExploring‚Äù that area won‚Äôt get you very far as it is extremely rural. Uncle
Roberts has plenty of vendors for food if you want to try dinner there. Also we stopped at a small winery in Volcano (literally called volcano winery I think).. it was small but nice inside and they were very friendly. I‚Äôll try to think if I have any other specific recommendations for you I can add. Download the Shaka guide app if you haven‚Äôt already.. it‚Äôs a GPS guided tour in your car and we did that on a day where it was super rainy."
TryingForABaby,ff82jf2,t3_es4vpw,1579664295.0,I feel you. I always thought I‚Äôd be relatively chill throughout this process but the slightest inconvenience makes me feel like the world is ending. I had to harass my OBs office for a week trying to get a Provera prescription they kept saying ‚Äúoh yeah yeah we know.‚Äù It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating when we so desperately want to be pregnant. A week or a month doesn‚Äôt mean shit to that office but to us it‚Äôs like an eternity of disappointment üò©

TryingForABaby,ff4qk4a,t1_ff4qfu4,1579570048.0,They are all bad. I got terrible indents two months ago from a box bought at Target in Pennsylvania... then the next month more horrible indents from a box bought Walmart in Hawaii of all places. I‚Äôm done with FRER.
TryingForABaby,ff19146,t3_er1vtb,1579476431.0,"Just my personal experience... I had like one very little spot of blood on day 5... nothing else. Doc didn‚Äôt care unless it had been a full 2 weeks. Long story short I ended up switching OBs... by the time I got to the new one, AF showed up exactly 27 days from that one little spot of blood. So I‚Äôm guessing that kick started things. But I was an emotional hot mess during that time. The new OB said if the Provera hadn‚Äôt work the first time, their practice is to give another round. She said you have to fail it twice for it to be considered unsuccessful. She also would have been ordering blood work but AF showed. Fingers crossed AF shows up for you soon. I know how terrible it is waiting. Sending some hugs.."

bichonfrise,fdovt9u,t3_emi03o,1578614020.0,"I think the fear of taking puppies too young from their mothers is that they are developing crucial social skills during that time from interacting with mom & littermates. They are more likely to end up with behavioral issues later on. Your kids will have the dogs entire life to bond with it, but the dog can‚Äôt get that socialization period back. Just my two cents."

TryingForABaby,fdakna0,t3_ekfopj,1578247109.0,I buy the internet cheapie OPKs and if I‚Äôm honest I pay absolutely zero attention to the time of day or how much I‚Äôve already drank or peed. It makes no difference for me personally. However my cycle is super regular so I can somewhat predict when I‚Äôll get my surge. If you are irregular or have extra long cycles it would probably be more important to be consistent with how you use them. Point is.. don‚Äôt stress (haha I know). After a month or two you‚Äôll find what process works best for your body. (but hopefully you‚Äôll be pregnant by then anyway!)
Miscarriage,fd6ghbn,t3_ek68a2,1578190635.0,I would say not normal. My d&c had no complications but I was back to normal the same day. Check if you have a fever. If your doctors office can‚Äôt get you in I would still go to an urgent care or something.
TryingForABaby,fczj16c,t3_ejp9as,1578102314.0,"Do not act like nothing happened. Acknowledge her loss. What would you do for someone who lost a parent or friend? Offer condolences, cook meals, say nice words.

Avoid phrases like ‚Äúyou can try again‚Äù or ‚Äúat least you‚Äôre still young.‚Äù Avoid talking about your pregnancy and baby at least in the short term around her. I know that sounds harsh but trust me it is going to be extremely painful for her to watch your pregnancy continue to progress. It is unlikely she will admit this to you but the feelings are often there. Also don‚Äôt be offended if she distances herself a little bit.

Understand that this a process and everyone grieves differently. There is no time limit on the process and she may still feel upset in future weeks months etc. Periodically ask how she is feeling both physically & emotionally. I felt like no one was checking in on me.

Also respect her privacy and don‚Äôt discuss the matter with someone unless you are sure she has already told them. Some people keep this time in their lives very private. Others will lean heavily on family/friends. Just follow her lead. Hope this helps"
AskVet,fcyu9dr,t3_ejlsbb,1578087207.0,"Our chow chow had a tumor growing in the back of her mouth/throat. We had scheduled a vet to come euthanize her at home before the symptoms got too severe. My husband and I made her a ‚Äúlast meal‚Äù of sorts and shared our tacos with her. Well this dog LOVED food and tried to scarf down an entire taco in one bite. With an already compromised swallow ability from the tumor, she started choking (as anyone would who tried to swallow a taco whole) and my husband and I looked at each other like OMG. Thinking we had accidentally killed our dog hours before she was set to be euthanized. She ended up swallowing and being okay but we still kind of laugh about it to this day üòÖ"

bichonfrise,fcxlvf3,t3_ejaz7c,1578066071.0,My pup had this as well. Unfortunately it can be quite dangerous if they get lodged in the urethra and prevent urination.. if you see signs of her struggling to pass urine or having urgency I was told to bring her to the emergency vet clinic. She is now on a prescription diet to prevent recurrence and we have had no issues since! That was about 3 years ago. The prescription food is rather expensive but effective in our case. Though I think it depends what type of ‚Äúcrystals‚Äù formed the stone because the food doesn‚Äôt work on every type.

AskVet,fc8x53z,t3_egnn2a,1577543499.0,We adopted our dog and found out at her first vet appointment a few weeks later she was superrrr positive for Lyme (blood test was through the roof). The shelter she came from is small and has very little money so I‚Äôm not sure how much medical care she received. They did offer to pay for her treatments but we declined. She was prescribed a lengthy course of antibiotics and that was it. She had a very pronounced limp but that went away over the course of a few months once the antibiotics were done. She still occasionally has pain if she does excessive activity but the vet said it probably residual arthritis from all the inflammation. Otherwise it‚Äôs been two years and I would have no idea she was a Lyme positive dog. She has had no further issues or complications. Obviously that might not be the case for everyone but that has been our experience.

Yes money and space are important but it doesn‚Äôt matter if you are committed to providing a great home. My good friend makes minimum wage and lives in a crummy apartment.. but she walks her dog several times a day and treats it better than some children are. The fact that you are even asking this question shows me you are more prepared than half the people adopting dogs out there. Realistically yes you need enough money to buy food and pay vet bills. Have a backup plan for someone that can care for the dog if you go out of town. Maybe don‚Äôt adopt a border collie with your limited space.

Trust me, doctors and nurses encounter some WEIRD people and requests. This would hardly be a blip on their radar. Also I believe testing for the flu is just a nasal swab which is noninvasive.

Edit: I will also add there are several website you can check medications and safety for pregnancy.. so if you are concerned about taking anything they prescribe you can double check on one of those... or check directly with the pharmacist when you pick it up.

Miscarriage,fc2nbmi,t3_efv6yg,1577367984.0,"We got an ornament for this years Christmas tree. I have a ring with baby‚Äôs would-be birthstone on it. We also booked a trip to Hawaii for January to take our minds off things. About a month after my MMC I finally told several people that didn‚Äôt even know I was pregnant. It felt worse keeping this awful thing inside pretending it didn‚Äôt happen. That helped some but I will also admit it was disappointing to see some people‚Äôs less than empathetic reactions. 

This is a bit more controversial but I started holding other people‚Äôs babies and talking with my pregnant friends. This isn‚Äôt helpful for everyone. I‚Äôd say the first 8-10 weeks following my MMC I avoided these things at all costs. I broke down into tears when one of my good friends announced she was pregnant. It was HARD. But.. as time moved on I couldn‚Äôt let myself continue to avoid and be fearful of these things. I held my 3 month old niece ALL day on Christmas Eve. I wanted my life to return to some sense of normalcy and I think I had to face my fears. Some people will never get to that point and that is okay. I still fought back a few tears when a cousin blindsided us with another pregnancy announcement that day. But I am getting a little better. You never get over it, you just learn to live with it.

Miscarriage,fbuj0x1,t3_eekt44,1577115230.0,"First of all.. know that everything you are reporting is normal. I felt the same exact way as your wife and would go from feeling perfectly fine to crying at the drop of a pin. My husband sort of acted as a guardian for me. Meaning he quickly changed the topics if strangers brought up babies, pregnancies, etc. If we were out and I felt myself getting upset or feeling anxious, he made an excuse for us to leave immediately. No questions asked. We were out with friends when someone announced a pregnancy, he took me outside and we walked around the block for about 30 minutes before I could go back in. This was the kind of support I needed but didn‚Äôt know how to ask for it."
