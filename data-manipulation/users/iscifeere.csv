socialanxiety,fek40os,t3_eoixl0,1579192139.0,"actually no, like, I have literally no friends. I can't even name 5 classmates of mine, I don't know anyone. Worst is, they're friendly, it's me who's awkward, and if I manage to turn down anxiety I just feel empty and uninterested in life in general. I sometimes daydream about having friends, but not being friends with my classmates because we are so unlike eachother, I don't like their music, I don't speak like them, I'm like a foreigner that never gets comfortable."
