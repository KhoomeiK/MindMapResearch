patientgamers,ffcwom9,t1_ffbx9rf,1579808836.0,"ESO is very good fun and with a Bluetooth keyboard it's basically wow.   got a keyboard for 5 quid on Amazon.

do the veteran maelstrom arena, at the level it was designed for, and you'll feel like a fucking king.  that is hands down the most challenging thing I've ever done in a game. it's a solo wave challenge.  there's a regular arena and then there's the veteran maelstrom arena.  you have limited deaths, it's timed, limited potions. everything appears in the same sequence, you just have to be good and fast and strong and have a character that's good at everything.  each wave has a unique set of challenges and you can't switch gear as you go.   if you beat it you get a title a RNG shot at awesome weapons. the VMA weapons are real trophies."
patientgamers,ffcwia3,t1_ffcvo8w,1579808731.0,yeah you'll enjoy cat quest.  it cost not much and was done in 3 days of casual play. so about 15 hours.

patientgamers,ffcvykt,t3_escqqs,1579808399.0,"mate theres tons of good grinding games. I love grinding for loot, xp etc.

obviously mmorpgs are best for this.  Elder Scrolls online is pretty good and free to play after the initial title purchase.  the sub for bank space and stuff does end up tempting you though, did over 800hrs in eso

Warframe is a great grinding game for about 400 hrs

Destiny 1 and 2 are great grinding games got 1000 hours in both

I like assassin's creed odyssey and origins, both grindable, good loot and xp.  fun combat

xenoblade chronicles 2 on switch was good fun. it's a bit weird with the comedy tits but once you get past that it's a solid game

the lastest star wars game is good fun

then of course there's monster hunter.  the king of the grind and gear.   ultimate Gen X in switch or world on PS4, both amazing fun.  switch version has significantly more content and is probably that last of that style of monster hunter, which was frankly fucking incredible."
patientgamers,ffcvdb7,t3_eski9v,1579808041.0,"I played cat quest after this.  I know there's no real link but it's a similarily light touch Rpg, but action RPG as opposed to golf.

I played golf story through 3 times now and it doesn't hold up that well to replays.  the old folks home is a massive slog to push through."

obviously this does not include things like flying an aeroplane.  but pretty much any normal, day to day activity, even if I've never done it before, yeah. I can probably do that.
