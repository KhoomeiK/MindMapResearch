The unused portions would just fall off the end of the line, shatter on the floor, and be shoveled back into the front end again.

I remember that they were not operating at anywhere close to full capacity, so it does not really surprise me that they would have opened the float glass line to non-automotive applications. 

Anyway, it closed some years ago, but is fondly remembered for being gloriously old school and gigantic in a way you just don't see often these days.

We should be modeling different systems worldwide, not just the usual suspects like Canada and the UK. From my time working in Korea I like their basic structure and approach to paying for it. Every citizen gets full basic coverage, and then there is a robust, competitive market for specialized secondary/supplementary insurance. My brother-in-law there is an investment banker there who earns a very high salary and also pays an ungodly amount for healthcare. My in-laws in their mid-70s pay nothing. In other words, you pay more during your working years and essentially nothing as you age. Nobody goes bankrupt or destitute there in old age because of medical bills."
