AskReddit,ffiif04,t1_ffi20bb,1579974612.0,"Used to have a UPS guy who would knock on the door with a quick five knocks the first time, then pound on it hard three times after three seconds.  And then would walk away after another three seconds.  If I was expecting a package I’d have to sign for, I had to run to get the door from the back of the house because it was always less than 10 seconds from the first knock.  Made my anxiety spike every damn time."

You could not turn around and sell a new car for the same price you got it for.  Most people will get the same overall value from a lower priced vehicle that is 2-4 years old and pay much less for it, even including maintenance costs."

Wore them for like two months and then took them off and they’ve been in a drawer since, have only worn them for a few hours in the last three years lol.  I hate wearing rings."

interestingasfuck,ffc8bsk,t1_ffb5w1m,1579793850.0,It sounds like this is really just to prevent injury and illnesses brought on by our current limited technology in supporting the infants rather than an attempt to mimic all of the processes that occur in the womb- so basically just as long as their lungs are mature enough to reduce the harm from a ventilator or even on their own.  Of course they’ll have a feeding aspect to it but to me it just sounds like a fluid-based ventilator.  I’m sure they will find that this is not a perfect solution but it will be a better solution than what we currently have!
