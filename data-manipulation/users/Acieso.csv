depression,fcz8wb7,t1_fcx82vg,1578096034.0,Thanks so much for this. I guess I agree that probably very few people have not actually benefited from going to see a professional for help. I'll plan it out and hopefully it all goes well.
depression,fcz8qit,t1_fcx7tfm,1578095945.0,Yeah I think most of all is the anxiety I get from just thinking about going to a professional. I've always kept to myself and telling someone in person about my problems just makes me feels weird and never really goes that well for me.
depression,fcx6btj,t1_fcwsfku,1578053041.0,"Same shit here, I don’t remember the last time I cried because I just have all these bottled up emotions that I just don’t care enough about anything to release them."
AskReddit,fcx5ftv,t1_fcwnoi9,1578052005.0,These symptoms are literally constant everyday for me.
depression,fc8gss3,t3_egmrx9,1577534578.0,"I don’t have anyone to vent to and I rarely ever talk about my emotions to anyone but I feel like it might be something I need to do so here it goes:

I went to a therapist a few weeks ago and I was told that I’m very likely to have depression because I have very bad suicidal thoughts. I’ll also be having terrible mood swings like I’ll be doing something like gaming or even hanging with my friends and a second later I have these thoughts of hate and evil in my mind and I start to just feel dead inside. I sometimes fantasize about one day just grabbing a knife from my kitchen and just ending it right there. Would I feel anything at all? Would my consciousness really be gone forever? What would I see in my final breaths? These are thoughts I often have especially late at night which is what keeps me up days at a time.

I also found out that I have some signs of severe anxiety as well as described by the therapist. I would lay awake at night in constant panic for hours on end and it’s non-stop. I always have constant anxiety everyday throughout the entire day. Always have clammy hands, cold sweats, paranoia and this weight in my chest that constantly feels like it wants to get out but it just simply can’t. The amount of hate I have built up inside me makes me want to physically hurt people and I’ll think about absolutely destroying someone but I learned to keep it all suppressed to give the illusion that I’m happy and nothing is ever wrong with me.

I’m also concerned with me possibly having ADHD/ADD because I’m constantly distracted and always couldn’t pay attention to anyone speaking directly to me for more than 5 seconds. This was always a problem for me as a kid to now me being 19. I’m too scared to go to a doctor to get diagnosed because idk maybe it’s all in my head or maybe I just want attention. This always was an obstacle especially in school because I was always the kid that never understood what any of my teachers were explaining and everyone was always pissed off at me for not understanding basic concepts like for math as an example. 

So yeah that’s pretty much everything going on atm, but I’m not sure, I’ve been really thinking of killing myself tomorrow or sometime soon because I can’t stand being constantly tired and knowing that I have another meaningless 50 years to live slaving away at shitty jobs where bosses hate all their employees. I can’t talk to my family because my parents are foreign and don’t understand mental health and my older sibling calls me useless because I can’t provide and do things like them. It’s pains me to know that nothing matters in life, so what’s the point of living it...

Edit: One of my close friends is actually diagnosed with ADHD and I exhibit almost the same behaviour as him. 

Only way I find happiness is through drugs as edgy as it may seem.."
