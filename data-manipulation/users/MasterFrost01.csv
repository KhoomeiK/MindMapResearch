You missed the point entirely. There are two factors that make up attractiveness: genetics and environment. There are two factors that make up general intelligence: genetics and environment. There cannot be anything else. The scale of those factors and how they interact is irrelevant.

We've agreed the components of attractiveness is some mix of genetics and environment, yet you're claiming the genetic factors of intelligence is 0, contrary to ALL evidence that I could find. Is that evidence flawless? Absolutely not. *But it is evidence.* Could the genetic factors be 0? Sure but there's no reason to assume that it is until there is some evidence for that argument.

Look, I know it's uncomfortable that some people are born with more advantages, but denying evidence isn't helpful for anyone. It's just a probability. All evidence is pointing towards A being more likely, but you're denying that it could be A because you want it to be B.

Please stop implying I am racist. But since you're intent on calling me a eugenicist, let's put this another way:

Is it fair to say that two generally attractive people (that is to say, people with even face symmetry, smooth skin etc.) have a higher *chance* of producing more generally attractive offspring than two unattractive people? If yes, do you consider it as eugenics to observe this phenomenon? In most people's opinions no, it is not, it is eugenics when you say ""let's sterilise the ugly people"".


Yes, with wealth and opportunities unattractive people can eat healthily, get a nice haircut or even have plastic surgery to increase their attractiveness (things which you are arguing are ""heritable"". I disagree that's the right word, not that the concept exists), but baseline chance of attractiveness, if you adjust for noise, remains lower.

Is there an inherent difference between attractiveness and intelligence? One is internal one is not, but both are entirely defined by genetics and the environment (as all things to do with human nature are)"

I don't understand why you're adamantly saying ""no"" when every study has reached the conclusion of ""yes"".

Since you ignored my question, I'll repeat it (slightly modified):

SubredditDrama,fdjyvrl,t1_fdju89q,1578491735.0,"You've chosen one paragraph that supports your biases rather than the majority of the article that goes against it, yet accuse me of cherry picking.

You say these peer reviewed studies suck, you say there's a chance that the conclusions could be wrong so there's no point in listening to the studies at all. *If* general intelligence *does* have a large genetic component, what would you accept as evidence? Evidently not multiple twin studies. Clone studies? Those won't be possible for a while, and will certainly not be ethical. 

You're focusing on the fact the conclusions *could* be wrong rather than they're *likely* somewhat correct. Your opinion seems to be we shouldn't even try to understand the data because we might be wrong, ignoring that we're probably correct. I haven't found any study into genetic inheritance of intelligence that has found there *isn't* a correlation, so there is no reason to assume there isn't a correlation over there is.

On the subject of Wikipedia, it has been proven time and time again to be mostly correct. Obviously it's not a reliable source, but I'm not writing an essay. I don't really feel like reading 100+ pages because of a Reddit disagreement, and I doubt you do either, so brief conclusions will have to do. Trusting that peer reviewed work is likely to be correct is a fact of life, we don't have the time to verify everything individually.

With any science, *especially* when dealing with the human mind, you can never truly be certain of anything, all you can do is prove something to a high degree of probability.

Sure, variance in intelligence could be entirely reliant on hidden environmental factors and it's being attributed to genetic differences, but it's highly unlikely. 

Just to clarify, no-one is saying genetics completely determine intelligence, just that it plays a larger role than environmental factors. Also to clarify, the studies don't focus on race at all, just intra-familial differences.

You missed the point entirely. There are two factors that make up attractiveness: genetics and environment. There are two factors that make up general intelligence: genetics and environment. There cannot be anything else. The scale of those factors and how they interact is irrelevant.

We've agreed the components of attractiveness is some mix of genetics and environment, yet you're claiming the genetic factors of intelligence is 0, contrary to ALL evidence that I could find. Is that evidence flawless? Absolutely not. *But it is evidence.* Could the genetic factors be 0? Sure but there's no reason to assume that it is until there is some evidence for that argument.

Look, I know it's uncomfortable that some people are born with more advantages, but denying evidence isn't helpful for anyone. It's just a probability. All evidence is pointing towards A being more likely, but you're denying that it could be A because you want it to be B.

Is it fair to say that two generally attractive people (that is to say, people with even face symmetry, smooth skin etc.) have a higher *chance* of producing more generally attractive offspring than two unattractive people? If yes, do you consider it as eugenics to observe this phenomenon? In most people's opinions no, it is not, it is eugenics when you say ""let's sterilise the ugly people"".


Yes, with wealth and opportunities unattractive people can eat healthily, get a nice haircut or even have plastic surgery to increase their attractiveness (things which you are arguing are ""heritable"". I disagree that's the right word, not that the concept exists), but baseline chance of attractiveness, if you adjust for noise, remains lower.

Is there an inherent difference between attractiveness and intelligence? One is internal one is not, but both are entirely defined by genetics and the environment (as all things to do with human nature are)"

I don't understand why you're adamantly saying ""no"" when every study has reached the conclusion of ""yes"".

SubredditDrama,fdjyvrl,t1_fdju89q,1578491735.0,"You've chosen one paragraph that supports your biases rather than the majority of the article that goes against it, yet accuse me of cherry picking.

You say these peer reviewed studies suck, you say there's a chance that the conclusions could be wrong so there's no point in listening to the studies at all. *If* general intelligence *does* have a large genetic component, what would you accept as evidence? Evidently not multiple twin studies. Clone studies? Those won't be possible for a while, and will certainly not be ethical. 

You're focusing on the fact the conclusions *could* be wrong rather than they're *likely* somewhat correct. Your opinion seems to be we shouldn't even try to understand the data because we might be wrong, ignoring that we're probably correct. I haven't found any study into genetic inheritance of intelligence that has found there *isn't* a correlation, so there is no reason to assume there isn't a correlation over there is.

On the subject of Wikipedia, it has been proven time and time again to be mostly correct. Obviously it's not a reliable source, but I'm not writing an essay. I don't really feel like reading 100+ pages because of a Reddit disagreement, and I doubt you do either, so brief conclusions will have to do. Trusting that peer reviewed work is likely to be correct is a fact of life, we don't have the time to verify everything individually.

With any science, *especially* when dealing with the human mind, you can never truly be certain of anything, all you can do is prove something to a high degree of probability.

Sure, variance in intelligence could be entirely reliant on hidden environmental factors and it's being attributed to genetic differences, but it's highly unlikely. 

Just to clarify, no-one is saying genetics completely determine intelligence, just that it plays a larger role than environmental factors. Also to clarify, the studies don't focus on race at all, just intra-familial differences.

As an aside, you do realise you're disagreeing with the science because you don't like the results? That's not a great position to have."
SubredditDrama,fdimthn,t1_fdi8ynz,1578446417.0,"Does it? Twin studies always have inherent issues because it's unethical to do such experiments on human children, but it's pretty much as close as we can get for verifying nature versus nurture in humans. The studies done show that there is a high probability that there is correlation between intelligence and genetics. The question isn't if genetics matters, it's how much it matters."
SubredditDrama,fdi7pmo,t1_fdhzdwo,1578437225.0,"Admittedly I'm only going off of Wikipedia's page on [inheritability of IQ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability_of_IQ) and I haven't thoroughly checked the sources, but the page mentions that, in the studies cited, ""family and parenting characteristics are not significant contributors to variation in IQ scores"" and that twins involved in twin studies raised apart show similar IQ with (fairly) high probability, 76%.

Also you're definitely using the word heritable wrong, heritable explicitly refers to traits expressed via *genetic* variation, *not* traits explained by the environment. You can check pretty much any dictionary or source of definition for the definition."

SubredditDrama,fdhz378,t1_fdhs53o,1578432782.0,"Heritable traits are the effects of passed down genetics, which admittedly is usually very hard to separate from nuture, but in this instance he's likely not wrong. General intelligence (that is to say, IQ) is more genetic based than people like to think. Unless you have naturally intelligent parents, you're unlikely to get far academially, no matter how hard you try."

I remember thinking it was a bad episode but I don't remember thinking it was about anything other than racism in the US, even if it wasn't totally accurate. Who is the ""white guy"" he's referring to, does he mean the space racist?"
