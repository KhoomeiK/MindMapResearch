careerguidance,ff3me4d,t1_ff3knmb,1579544145.0,"I’m not saying even where your in a job you love it won’t be difficult. However my point was so many people complain about not being happy and only being in a job for money, but you can cut your costs back and get a job paying less and be happy. My point is happiness over money"
careerguidance,ff33b6n,t1_ff309uz,1579532585.0,"I appreciate the feedback. I appreciate obviously people have bills to pay but you can always reduce your costs as well.

My point is don’t stay in a job your miserable in. I get it may not be easy to find one but don’t give up until you do so you can be happy.

I’m saying choose happiness over money"
