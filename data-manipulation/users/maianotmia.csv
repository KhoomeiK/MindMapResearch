offmychest,ff2g7z4,t1_ff1ax6e,1579504795.0,That’s a fantastic perspective and a really mature next step. Sometimes just getting a little closure will allow your mind to move on and stop thinking of your past so negatively. I seriously wish you two the best!
offmychest,ff18ajq,t3_er3n54,1579476218.0,"I know where you’re coming from. My husband and I have been together since we were 15 (almost 15 years ago). We have a ton of baggage as well. We were dumb kids who made dumb decisions. It’s weird to be this far into life with the same person that knew you when you were essentially a child. We are both in therapy (couples and individual) and I’ve grappled with the same thoughts that you’re having. I’ve worked on being really forgiving towards myself (and I suppose my partner as well) about things I did and ways I acted when we were fresh into our relationship. We’re all still developing and trying to figure out how to be an adult when we’re in high school and even college. It’s normal to do stupid, immature things! That’s all a part of growing up. It’s just that usually, those people we encountered during those shenanigans usually aren’t in our lives many years later. 

My husband and I pretty much never talk about the bad stuff from back then and we spend a lot of time talking about how much fun we had together and how we thought we were so grown up. It helps to kind of reshape those memories and look back on our time together fondly. It’s actually pretty special to have so much to look back on.

As cliché as it sounds, your past does not define you. Just keep pushing forward. It gets easier to focus on the fun things! You both seem like very conscientious people who care about and respect each other a lot and that will take you far."

offmychest,femwop8,t1_femudb0,1579271575.0,"You’ve made it this far. You’ve pushed past all those hard days when you’ve felt this low. That in itself shows your strength and inspires me to do the same. I get that it’s hard to keep going, but I see a person who, despite having depression, is able to put one foot in front of the other and make it through the day. Your life matters."

dating_advice,fejtt7h,t3_epk1x4,1579185689.0,"This all sounds like an honest mistake. He does not deserve to be dumped based solely on him accidentally falling asleep. The fact that he messaged profusely shortly after you left is an indication that he didn’t intend to blow you off or make you sit in his driveway for so long. And honestly, if he was trying to blow you off or ghost you, why would he even bother messaging that same night? 

The way you handled it was really not great, tbh. If you two really like each other and want to keep moving forward, you’re going to have to check yourself. If you lump him into the category of all those other douchebags that have wronged you in the past, you might lose a guy that is actually really great."

I don’t know why I got downvoted for saying I have safety concerns about a country that has a high murder/kidnapping rate. I know that can happen anywhere, but it happens there a lot and it’s ok to have concerns since I’ll be bringing my 3 year old.

BoneAppleTea,fe2tfgk,t1_fe2n54r,1578842675.0,"Nowhere in the post do you explain that this is a friend or a joke. You nit picked a tiny, insignificant, easily-overlooked error made by your best mate and your response to them was seemingly condescending (the whole “pat pat” thing).

If I was your good friend, I’d say that you have changed and improved yourself. It takes a lot of courage and strength to recognize and change that behavior and you’ve succeeded at that. That’s a huge step and you deserve to celebrate that by being happy for yourself. Now work towards forgiving yourself and understand that you are a better person. I believe you can move past this and find happiness!"

offmychest,fdj4jl7,t1_fdi2src,1578458252.0,"From an outsider’s perspective, I completely agree with you. Motherhood is draining without a difficult partner, so I know his lack of involvement is making it so much worse. I really hope something changes because you don’t want to look back resenting these years of your child’s life.

Changing is super hard, but it’s worth it."
offmychest,fdi0ip6,t3_eli6al,1578433558.0,"I’m assuming you’ve told him how you feel? 

Now is a good time to sit him down and set some expectations for how things are going to go from now on. You may even need write out an hour-by-hour schedule together. He does not get a choice in this. You don’t get to just be off when you have a kid - that isn’t what he signed up for. He also doesn’t just get to “babysit”. This is just as much his responsibility and priority and he needs to take some ownership here. You are probably sleep-deprived, frustrated, bored, and in need of a coparent and that is not too much to ask. You should get breaks daily (and not just when the kiddo is asleep). He should be able to accommodate that. Plan a girls night out with some friends on a weekly basis if you can and don’t give him the option to protest. 

I’m sorry you even have to deal with this in the first place. The first couple years are TOUGH. I’m wishing you the best!"

dating_advice,fcs5vcn,t3_einfad,1577911871.0,"Sounds like pretty typical teenage girl behavior, honestly. She’s probably getting advice from friends about how to act towards you. And even if she isn’t, she is still in the beginning stages of having a mature relationship, so it’s likely that she just hasn’t figured it all out yet.

If I were you, I’d gently bring up how you feel and how it’s affecting you. Ask her if there’s something wrong or anything you can do to help her. If you want to have a relationship, having honest and potentially tough conversations is a part of it. You will only get more frustrated and more put off by her behavior if you ignore it. Just remember to approach this situation with compassion and understanding. Good luck!"
