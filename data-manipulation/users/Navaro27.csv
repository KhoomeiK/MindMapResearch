diabetes,fc469y0,t3_eg3pdg,1577407755.0,"6.6 in the grand scheme of things isn't too bad. So don't freak out. The doctor really should have prepared you better, unfortunately too many are quick to usher you out and don't spend the time they should with you. 

Firstly, I'd recommend checking 3 times a day. Morning as you rise (can fluctuate upwards, see dawn phenomenon) 2 hours after lunch, and 2 hours after dinner. 

Learn what diet does to you and portion size. See how it affects your blood glucose. 

In regards to diet, you're going to want to cut carbs. No starchy vegetables like potatoes, and stick to leafy greens, mushrooms etc...  I recommend looking up keto friendly diets. 

Also cut all refined sugar, sodas etc. 

Thankfully you're on this early, so with some changes you'll be a super star. 

Did your doctor suggest a follow up appointment?

I'm sure others will sweep in here with a lot better information, but this should get you started. 

All the best."
