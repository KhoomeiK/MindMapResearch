gifsthatkeepongiving,ff7pqrp,t1_ff7mlou,1579655363.0,">That is the single most annoying thing on the face of the planet.

Can't be worse than when the earphones cable gets stuck on a door handle and it rips it off your ear, can it?"
Cringetopia,ff6uwk4,t1_ff68cny,1579635383.0,"To be fair doctors misusing a diagnostic tool isn't really a problem with the tool (which is just an arbitrary index that is statistically related to some negative health outcomes), it's a problem with those specific doctors. That's like if I started using people's height as a tool to estimate their intelligence. It wouldn't work, but that has nothing to do with whether height is a legitimate measurement, it's just not what it's for."
edX,ff5vwtv,t1_fddhldx,1579612048.0,"For some reason for self-paced courses that option doesn't work, it just brings me back to the ""upgrade"" page."
Cringetopia,ff5ks1a,t1_ff40ekd,1579597637.0,"Could be, but I wouldn't be so sure it's furry targeted. The lifting world is weird as fuck and I have seen a lot of old black iron gyms with this kind of design and name. It's like a softer version of /r/thepack with fewer guns and more muscles."
Cringetopia,ff5k5z7,t1_ff54e13,1579596750.0,"Don't spread that kind of misinformation. It's not a shit measurement, it is a screening tool. Its role isn't to say you're healthy vs not healthy, it's to say you're probably healthy vs we need more tests. That's why if you have a high BMI your doctor should measure stuff like waist circumference, in order to determine if your adiposity is putting you at risk of health complications down the line.

Also, and I want to stress that out, carrying too much weight is a risk regardless of whether that weight is fat or muscle."
britishproblems,ff4incm,t1_ff1d7ei,1579564523.0,"They're not fundamentally bad, in that a lot just want to be left alone, but there are enough bad ones that it makes them a problem. For having talked with a lot of them (in my country), the good/pacifist traveller families are as scared of the bad/criminal ones as we are and would like nothing more than for the authorities to get rid of them."
britishproblems,ff4bt55,t1_fezsmez,1579559931.0,"Never met a French person who hates English people, and as a Frenchman I have spent a lot of time there. People do hate when a bunch of English people build their own little villages though, as integration is an important value of the country."

insaneparents,fen1mgq,t1_femr4wt,1579274952.0,"Same, I work in a university and take a lot of public transport which has a lot of elderly people and mother's carrying their babies. I don't care if I get the flu, but I don't want to murder people with my negligence."
insaneparents,fen1fmf,t1_fejy1ta,1579274829.0,">They have to guess what the years mutations will be for the flu and sometimes they guess wrong. On top of that some people get pretty sick EVERY time they get the flu shot (my grandpa for example). 

Your second point is precisely why you should get the shot anyway. Some people cannot, and if you don't take reasonable precautions to not contaminate them (i.e. getting the shot) you are trash."
britishproblems,femt4p8,t3_epih5o,1579268861.0,I am keeping a mental file of everybody who doesn't wash their hands where I work and make sure I don't touch anything when I am in their office.
technology,femncav,t1_femeq31,1579263554.0,Yeah it's literally a research problem. And the cost of a false positive (a real user getting banned) makes it even harder.
television,femga9v,t1_fem54x2,1579253977.0,"Oh wow you are blowing my mind, I was convinced for some reason that they changed every season and I don't know why."
television,felmkii,t1_felluax,1579225768.0,"Yeah but the idea behind it is still good. Different stories, different storytellers, different casts, same universe."
television,felfg9s,t1_fekznns,1579220917.0,"Would work well like True Detective, with a different director, different actors and a different story each season."

france,feka83v,t1_fek8z9p,1579195832.0,"> (sauf si la majorité est dans la merde, mais pour le moment, en france, on en est loin).

Je suis pas sûr que je suive ta logique, parce que je suis d'accord avec mon idéologie et je suis loin d'être dans la merde.

> ça reste un sophisme, c'était clairement une tentative de discréditer ma personne au lieu de s'attaquer aux arguments opposés aux idées que tu défends. C'est comme si je t'avais répondu ""Ah, un enseignant qui défend la légalisation du canabis, pas étonnant qu'il soit anti-capitalisme"".

Au risque de surprendre, j'ai jamais touché au cannabis (personnalité addictive, tout ça, ça vaut pas le risque)! Et je ne vois pas en quoi ça discrédite ta personne."
