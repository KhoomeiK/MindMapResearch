Braves,ffr6krj,t1_ffqx2q6,1580151554.0,"Watching Folty hit makes me want to trade him. I mean, if you care so little about your craft as a baseball player first and a pitcher second that you clearly never practice, then how does that not translate to other parts of your game? No thanks."

baseball,ffd9euz,t1_ffccq12,1579816010.0," This isn't really that funny, mostly because everyone agrees that we suck in the playoffs -- even us Braves fans. While the gNats fans were always in denial on post-season choking. They merely adopted it. We were born in it, molded by it. We didn’t see it until we were already men; but by then, it was nothing to us but victory! The post-season choking will only betray you, because it belongs to us. We will show you where we have made our home, whilst preparing to bring in sweet, miserable defeat. We never wonder what will break first -- our spirit, or our body -- it's always the spirit; it brings us much more misery, and we gratefully accept our fate without complaint."
