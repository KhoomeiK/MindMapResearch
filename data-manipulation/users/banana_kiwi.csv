infj,ffdz2p2,t1_ffdyq8k,1579832506.0,"Yeah, I'm thinking the same thing.

Also, openly talking about your ex is maybe a little weird but it's not the worst thing in the world.

It was pretty bold of them to immediately label the relationship as ""very toxic"" just based on that much."
RandomThoughts,fezbanj,t3_equ661,1579455630.0,"Eh, death to me is part of nature. It's just the way things are.

Everyone has a timeline, and we don't usually know when it will end until we're almost there.

I am only 19 and don't plan to die soon, but if I did I don't think I'd be too upset in the process. I think I would be able to accept it.

I mean you can't fight it, so why die trying – when instead you can die not trying?

That is, of course, assuming it was a slower death. If it was a swift one, I wouldn't really have time to think about that, would I? But regardless, I see neither as better than the other."
horn,fez8rq7,t1_few8kqm,1579454896.0,"It gives me anxiety to see them sitting on a chair at all.

People always look at me weird for putting my horn under my chair.

Is it irrational and probably unnecessary? Maybe. But it makes me feel better, because otherwise it just takes one person to bump into the chair for the horn to be damaged, and horns are friccin expensive."

Brawlhalla,femapqv,t1_feljlmf,1579246274.0,Idk I've been playing for 3 years and I didn't buy any taunts until a few days ago
drumcorps,felwxvp,t3_eps5tb,1579233010.0,"In drum corps, all the same because all these instruments have piston valves.

However outside of drum corps, trombones use slide grease/oil, and horns and many concert tubas use rotary valve oil, so that might be why you're thinking they would be different."
infj,felw42i,t1_fel7564,1579232405.0,"I'm pretty sure OP was asking about INFP, not INTP, but as someone who is unsure between all 3 of those types, thanks for this info."

infj,fe6d42s,t1_fe6cadv,1578887416.0,"I do feel guilty. Not necessarily because I have FOMO. It's more that I feel like a failure, and frankly I am.

I'm bipolar and I'm not stable enough right now to be in school or hold down a job, so I'm not doing anything productive and instead I sleep all the time.

And I feel guilty for this because obviously it's not helping me get better and it makes me more of a burden on other people for support"
infj,fe6cf6z,t3_enwtta,1578886892.0,"Probably because you're an authentic person in an inauthentic world, so you don't pretend to act happy all the time by surrounding yourself with other people.

To get people to stop bothering you you can either act happy or act busy; put on a smile or put on headphones. Your choice.

You probably just need to find a way to look more noticeably happy."
infj,fe6c5gy,t1_fe64crx,1578886689.0,"So

You might feel fine but it's not healthy at all and even if this is only for a few days at a time, 10 minutes per night is going to stunt your physical and mental growth. If you keep this up, at your age, you'll run into a lot of problems. It *will* catch up to you eventually, probably in college.

So please try to sleep, and if you really can't, please talk to a doctor or someone qualified to help you"
infj,fe6boxp,t1_fe5ubdl,1578886348.0,"A lot of things can be causing this: sleep disorders (apnea?), stress, depression, anxiety, or just bad habits

Personally I don't think it has anything to do with MBTI"
infj,fe6bhj7,t1_fe5ypsf,1578886199.0,"More than 12 definitely seems like an unhealthy habit unless you're sick or recovering or something.

If you're a fully grown adult (like 25+), I'd guess like 10 hours at the most, otherwise you probably have some illness or disorder.

Younger than that, maybe a bit more for some people but definitely not 14.

I say this hypocritically, because I tend to sleep too much out of laziness. I'm not a doctor; I'm just someone who sleeps a lot and randomly researches it"
infj,fe6aje1,t1_fe5de3a,1578885506.0,"As an HSP and an INFJ I am wondering:

Do you have a source to support you claim that a lot of INFJs are HSP?"

AskReddit,fe0mrih,t3_enc8xh,1578816208.0,"Personally speaking, no, not at all. But I've never been one to idolize celebrities; in fact, quite the opposite for most of them. Most of my life I was unreasonably anti-celebrity and only now am I starting to appreciate that they are people too and some of them are genuine"

On that site specifically the cognitive functions test in my opinion, although their general MBTI test is pretty good too"

infj,fdnlbp2,t1_fdmsi8o,1578588193.0,"It's a personality disorder, not an illness; it's not curable, only copable. It simply describes faults in the way people are.

Any given personality trait deemed undesirable could be labeled as a disorder, but that doesn't justify bad behavior.

To illustrate this point: narcissistic personality disorder is in the same cluster as antisocial personality disorder (aka psychopathy and sociopathy). It's not their fault, but they do need to be held socially accountable just like everyone else if they are exhibiting mean or even dangerous behavior.

I'm all for compassion empathy towards the mentally ill, but this is a different category because it's not an illness that can just be cured with some encouragement."
INTP,fdmfo2a,t3_ely6v3,1578548332.0,"Curses include some of my favorite words. But, I try to use them sparingly.

Whether using them to express firmness or go express humor, they are more effective the less you use them."
INTP,fdmerwa,t3_em325r,1578547514.0,"I think the incongruence is that as a generalization, our sense of humor is vastly different than other most people.

INTPs tend to embrace meme culture as well as wordplay, and especially dry humor, where other types might find playful sarcasm or ""goofy cute things"" funny.

Edit: also, Ti causes us to analyze anything and everything, so we probably appear outrageously contemplative to other people, which could be taken as seriousness"
INTP,fdjz4vl,t1_fdjxetx,1578491934.0,"I suppose your argument holds up better in circumstances where there is more depth to the hidden identity, which include the more important circumstances and arguably are the intended subject of the post.

I'm just imagining a literal scenario where a secretly blue person finds an openly blue person and they're just like, ""woah crazy dude, me too"" and they suddenly reveal themselves.

But yeah, if we're talking about someone hiding their whole identity it's not so simple to suddenly reveal it.

I feel satisfied with this exchange. Thanks."
INTP,fdjxtjz,t3_eln9y4,1578490884.0,"Yes, I do feel that way. With stronger Fe you can read people, judge what they like, and then act accordingly.

In moderation that's good if it stays attached to your true self.

If you go further you become a caricature. It might be a really attractive caricature. But nothing genuine will come of it.

I don't see anything wrong with it in situations where genuineness doesn't matter, for example hookups or a business exchange. But don't lose your true self because you need it for friendships and relationships."
Brawlhalla,fdjx2lb,t1_fdjns04,1578490253.0,"The poor Brynn dodged into the first one so they couldn't dodge after that.

On the second one they tried to jump over but the Volkov read that and got em with the gravity cancel

The rest was an attempt to recover and I'm not sure there's much they could have done without putting themselves in an equally risky situation

So yes, first dodge was oopsie and they could've gotten out of it. But I don't think I'd call them braindead"
INTP,fdjwe3q,t1_fdjtbt8,1578489662.0,"If I may propose an egocentric perspective that I don't necessarily endorse, but I feel like playing the devil's advocate because I feel like making an argument:

This is a reason for other people to be themselves, not necessarily for *you* to be yourself. Who says the way we act is how we expect others to act?"
