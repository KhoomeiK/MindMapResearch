Maturity will win out. 

Also those glasses are stylish, cool people will like them. Fuck the haters.

When you go to college or get out of high school the world will be completely different. Hell, in two years the world will be completely different. 

If you have self esteem issues, try getting into a sport and just stick it out, all the way through. 13 is the perfect age to start soccer in school. 

Sure sometimes sports sucks, but the great part is you’ll get in shape, if out of shape, and you meet people who will work with you regardless of who you are."

Get a grip. Find what you really like and do that. Don’t choose a fucking major because your buddies or daddy says so. Fucking choose the major that will make you happy. There is always a way to monetize your loves of life. Trust me. Look for it, experiment, with classes and sex, and drugs, and parties. You are literally in the last great social common experience.
