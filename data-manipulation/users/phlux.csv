Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. There are four main sub-groupings of coronaviruses, known as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta.

Human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid-1960s. The seven coronaviruses that can infect people are:

#Common human coronaviruses

1. 229E (alpha coronavirus)
1. NL63 (alpha coronavirus)
1. OC43 (beta coronavirus)
1. HKU1 (beta coronavirus)

People around the world commonly get infected with human coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1.
