raisedbynarcissists,ffnnp2p,t3_eu6wnf,1580068242.0,"Another reason why I left religion: they often see black and white, plus how parents are the ultimate god (in my religion/culture anyway.) 

Nothing is black and white; just because you carried a child for 9 months and push the kid out, it doesn't automatically make you a good mother. 

They often talk of morals but fail to see one in these parents who claim parenthood without behaving like one. 

I'm sorry, OP."

Unfortunately, I couldn't do much other than having to break up with that person. I craved a little more than being called pet names and told how sexy I was. 

Nope. It was without substance and that frustrated me."

Unless you've gone total bonkers, that's her responsibility to get her shit together. You should go to the police for destruction of property.

AsianParentStories,ffkrjr7,t3_etxxsc,1580027627.0,"That's their issue to figure it out. Not yours. 

You have a life to live and now it's the time to live _your_ life, not to be a distraction for someone else.

Edit: Where are you from, OP? 

I imagine that you're an adult, over 18 years old, who has a job and is very capable of living their life. 

If you didn't go home and they call the police, let them do that. You can also talk to the police themselves and explain how it was a false report; that you're alive and well, not sick or anything like they claim you to be. 

You're not a doll. You're human being. Consider talking to your employers or managers about your parents too. Let them know that if your parents ever call them about you 'disappearing', it's not the case, but it's you wanting to live your life."

TwoXChromosomes,ffkqssm,t3_etzp1z,1580027261.0,"Uh, this is super sketchy and scary. I hope you never plan to meet this stranger/strange man. 

A father isn't just someone who shot out their sperm, but the one who's staying and raising his children. This bio dad, not only did he take away your mother's consent, now he's also trying to meet up with _you_. 

What if he rapes you too? That's not okay. I bet there are other victims out there as well.

Just ignore this man, OP. You have a happy life with happy parents. Ignore the trash."
