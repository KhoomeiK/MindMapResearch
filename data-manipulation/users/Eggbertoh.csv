The game gas changed a lot and they're more technically proficient now, but either way those were the goalies everyone played and nobody even came close to putting up the kind of numbers Gretzky was."
todayilearned,ff4cr26,t1_ff4bcpa,1579560547.0,"Gretzky was INCREDIBLY good, AND nobody else came close.


The game was different and goalies were certainly worse, but also nobody else in the entire league was putting up the kind of numbers Gretzky was. Gretzky put up over 200 points in a season 4 times. 



To put that in perspective Mario Lemieux is widely considered the 2nd best player ever, and he put up 199 one time... But after that the next closest player is Yzerman with 155. I think Gretzky's highest season was 216 so that's a clear 60 point difference.

politics,fde5k07,t1_fddjtho,1578331657.0,"Well first let's make sure we're discussing this based on the same set of facts as it seems like you're conflating two different situations in this conflict.


 The US contractor that was killed happened days before the embassy was 'stormed' by protestors, and he was not killed at the US embassy meaning he wasn't killed on US soil. No americans were killed when protestors breached the embassy. In fact the US had already retaliated and killed around 25 militants in air strikes as a result of the death of the contractor, and this resulted in the protests at the embassy. 



So... since you apparently want to deal in hypotheticals; if an american is killed on american soil we need to show extreme force. Do you also believe this means we need to take extreme measures in the wake of mass shootings in America? 


And to answer your question about what Trump should have done differently: He had already retaliated for the US contractor being killed. I hate war, but cannot fault him for attacking their compounds and killing those involved. Killing an Iranian general is not a proportionate response to the resulting protests. Instead of this bolstering security in the area with troop deployments and further surveillance would have both prevented this conflict, andnot further escalated things. Evacuating non-military personnel on top of this would have been the more appropriate response. 


Not every transgression against the US needs to be met with escalating bloodshed, and Trunp's aggressive response to the situation places more American lives at risk unnecessarily."
