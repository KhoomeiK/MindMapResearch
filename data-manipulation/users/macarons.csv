AskReddit,ffmkrqr,t3_eu6wt2,1580055981.0,"The crazee (sp.?) bread from Little Caesars! I remember being a little kid and going to K-Mart to eat there while shopping. Probably one American food that everyone in my family loved, especially my mom. 

Also grilled chicken wings and sticky and sticky rice. We would often have family gatherings/cookouts at my house. I look back at those BBQ memories w/ Rose colored glasses knowing how fucked up my family is as an adult right now. But boy, I sure did have the time of my life being with my cousins as a child. Too bad we all grew apart."

AskReddit,ffkbdpo,t3_etts4s,1580020007.0,"It's an odd mix of passion+dreams and fear. 

I think so much about the people I've encountered throughout life. Friends, acquaintances, strangers... The impact they've had on my life, and what I've had on theirs. 

I don't want to leave this world just yet, knowing that someone out there too is feeling what I've felt in my darkest days. 

I don't want to be famous or popular, I just want to make meaningful relationships and connections with the right people. 

And of course, my mom. My #1 supporter. I love that woman. I don't want to ever imagine what her reaction would be if I ever left this world before she does.

Death will be inevitable. Life is shitty as it already is. I'm not going to just let it take over me like that. I want to bring good to the world and make art. It's a constant fight to continue living. That's why I keep on dreaming about new things, and big things. 

Honestly I am fucking scared of dying, so I'm just trying the hardest I can to distract myself by making my own fantasy world filled with rainbows and sunshine while it lasts.

I have many moments of highs&lows, but my passion for art and my dreams seem to have been doing a good job of keeping me here."
