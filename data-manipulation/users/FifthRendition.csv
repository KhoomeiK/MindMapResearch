daddit,ffiv6zc,t1_ffip7xg,1579983512.0," Ingest thing I learned as a parent within the first few months is to be flexible enough to know when you messed up and change something quickly.

coolguides,fefnadi,t3_eoqkb9,1579060048.0,"I was a young deputy sheriff at one point in my life undergoing training out in the field. I had my Field Training Officer with me and after I had stopped a guy, can’t remember what for, I was reading this guy’s information out over the radio. Back then we didn’t have the best computers where I could type it in so I had to ask the dispatcher over the radio to run it for me. Standard procedure is to read the name and then spell it out, phonetically. 

Now I had been in some sort of law enforcement capacity for my whole life and for me spelling things phonetically is super super natural. I didn’t think about it, I just said it. For this particular agency I was with, they had a different way to spell things. Instead of the nato version, it was based on names. Nora, Oscar, Paul, etc. 

I was reading the name out and I had done it all correctly until I got to M, which was Mary for them, but instead I said Mike. My FTO said in the loudest voice as he could, with the mic keyed up “GODDAMIT I HAVE TO KEEP TELLING YOU ITS MARY ITS NOT MIKE.” I paused because I knew the whole goddamn county just heard me get corrected over the radio. I paused, corrected myself and continued on, no easy feat because I was totally embarrassed. And that is how I changed mike to Mary and never did it again."

We’re always going to be beholden to an ISP. Anything where we get our connectivity from will be our ISP. What makes municipalities great is that it encourages competition in the market, which is what we need to drive innovation in networking, the internet, and to bring costs down. Regulation unfortunately just won’t cut it anymore, FCC is a joke in enforcing any kind of regulation against the big 2, 3, or 4."
crowdstrike,fecds7t,t1_fecbfpg,1578971522.0,"The reason we say to not use it because ProvNoWait leads to a false sense of security. If someone uses that command and then leaves it assuming it’ll check in and install, there’s no guarantee they’ll check up on it later. They’ll believe the sensor is installed and when/if the host gets pwned, they won’t know until it’s too late."
