changemyview,ffv4fq1,t3_evcqno,1580255434.0,"I assume from your college statement, that you're from the US and therefore the legal age is 21.

I kinda disagree and agree at the same point..

I think it has a lot to do with how the alcohol culture is, compared to places where the age is way lower..

Drinking is not good at all, dealing with problems myself atm, but learning to drink in a younger age have helped me see what I don't wanna become and how I can do better..

In denmark you can drink legal by the age of 16, most start out/try alcohol by the age of 13..
Here we know that harder alcohol gets you fucked up, and beer and lower alcohol such as wine is a substance you have easier control of (not to say we don't get fucked up on harder alcohol). You have to be over 18 to buy alcohol with 16.5% or higher alc. Because of this. 

When I've talked to Americans about alcohol, it's mostly a big party and LOTS of hard alcohol.. It's gets people fucked up quick and hard.

This is a huge cultural difference, also that alcohol is looked so hard down upon in the states, gives it this BIG SCARY ILLEGAL feel, instead of here, where we don't really care if people get drunk, open streets, 10am..its called Nørrebro, Copenhagen...


Tl:dr: it's the American alcohol culture that's wicked. It should be lower age so the understanding and general feel of alcohol is changed.
