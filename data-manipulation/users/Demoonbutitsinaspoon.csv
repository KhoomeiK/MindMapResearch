I see sounds delicious! Best of luck next time!"
FoodPorn,ffnmvxv,t3_eub5ee,1580068036.0,"It looks lovely! I hope your husband liked it! 

May I suggest you bake the crust for a bit longer if you decide to bake this tart another time. I think the golden brown colour is really pretty and ties the tart aesthetic together if that makes sense! Hope I didn't come across as rude. Have a lovely day and may your husband have an even lovelier one!"
anime,fflok7u,t1_ffl87ns,1580042172.0,Ah yes I used to have a MAL acc but I forgot the password and I couldn't be bothered :'). Thanks tho I'll take that into consideration!
anime,ffl5bh6,t1_ffl3h3e,1580035064.0,"Oh my, oh my. If I recall correctly I haven't watched your first suggestion and it seems I've been missing out on some good stuff. I'll definitely check that one out. As for the rest I've seen them all except Lupin the third. I'm very thankful! Hope you have a lovely day!"
anime,ffl4x3i,t1_ffl0d4n,1580034862.0,I've watched both of those and enjoyed them a lot! Thanks for the awesome recommendations tho!
anime,ffl4pk6,t1_ffl1401,1580034758.0,Oh yeah that one was very interesting too. I liked it a lot. The characters were really well developed (imo). It was enjoyable. Thanks for the recommendation again!
anime,ffkz205,t1_ffkxy1e,1580031712.0,Seen that one too. It was a pretty damn entertaining watch. Thanks for the recommendation hope you have a nice day!
anime,ffjqavu,t1_ffjpnv1,1580004228.0,I've only heard about it but I don't think it interests me enough. Thanks tho!
anime,ffjpbko,t1_ffjp3mq,1580003570.0,"No worries I too associate completely different series with one another for no reason. 

I've seen that one too but thank you again! Hope you have a lovely day"
anime,ffjp1ii,t1_ffjnzj9,1580003384.0,Ooh I'm so sorry I misunderstood your comment. I thought the series I had mentioned above weren't similar to Erased. I apologise.
anime,ffjoyww,t1_ffjnzj9,1580003337.0,"Dunno I found Erased quite sad and some of the series I mentioned above left me feeling in a similar way. Another was pretty good but not my cup of tea. I personally find Elfen Lied, Hellsing and Devilman to be a better representation of the horror anime genre. Devilman in particular gave me a similar feeling to Erased."
anime,ffjnaww,t1_ffjn0t8,1580002207.0,I definitely will! Thank you!
anime,ffjn7ai,t1_ffjmyyt,1580002139.0,Yeah I'm usually patient when it comes to such series and wouldn't mind watching 10-20 eps til it gets good but this series was somewhat different and I couldn't finish the first season. I'll give it another try tho so thank you so much.
anime,ffjmw93,t1_ffjmt1w,1580001937.0,Ah no need to apologise! I'm really thankful anyways! Have a lovely day!
anime,ffjmqfm,t1_ffjmj4b,1580001824.0,Ah man this one was great too. I remember reading the manga because I couldn't wait for the second season. Thanks for the recommendation tho! Have a lovely day!
anime,ffjmnm4,t1_ffjm4bn,1580001770.0,I've tried watching it but i always got tired of it after 3-4 episodes tho I guess I can give it a 3rd try. Thank you so much!
anime,ffjml73,t1_ffjm6am,1580001724.0,Ah damn I've seen them all. They were all pretty damn good. Thanks for the recommendations tho I appreciate it!
anime,ffjmj63,t3_etzta2,1580001685.0,"I think i should've mention I've watched similar similar series such as: re:zero, orange, anohana, the promised never land, relife, your name, your lie in April, a silent voice, death parade, violet evergarden, kokosake, a garden of words.

Aka all those classic good ol ""make your heart ache"" movies/series. They're all great and different in their own way ofc."

AskReddit,felcmjk,t3_epj100,1579219035.0, Fixation and TCOM (the company of myself). That's two games but they're connected so yeah. These ones are relatively old and trashy in other people's eyes but they hold a special place in my heart. I love the story so much. Would recommend to start off with TCOM if you're interested in the story more than the game as a whole. Definitely deserves more love than it got.
TrollXChromosomes,fdo7c5x,t3_em9ikt,1578600154.0,"I think we should also add ""men using toys to masturbate"". It's still seen as ""gay"" to do that and it's honestly so sad. Everyone has the right to use sex toys!!! Different strokes for different folks"
