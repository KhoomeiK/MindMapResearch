We were still friends online, I just didn’t see their posts. I would never get upset at them for sharing their pregnancy pains because they’re allowed to vent on their own pages. They shouldn’t have to tiptoe around because they may or may not have friends who had miscarried or struggled to conceive. You aren’t being disrespectful or cruel or anything like that.
