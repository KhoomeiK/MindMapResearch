They took Vikendi out of rotation because they messed the map up, saturated it with bolts, and most of us didn’t like it.

This, from a map that when released was as anti-sniper as it could be. 

Miramar isn’t that bad in comparison. Now that loot is plenty, it’s fun. You can get ARs and DMRs so easily, as it should have been, being the largest map with so many hills. I no longer come across 20/100 lobbies on Miramar, because it’s fun now."

Showerthoughts,fg5wgw6,t1_fg5q3ir,1580541796.0,"Ah, it seems it’s time for a history lesson.

Let’s look at France in 1789. The ruling elite treated the lower class citizens as trash. While the peasants slaved away their lives to keep the wheels turning, despite starvation and illness, the rich ate well, enjoyed their lives, and then stomped on the poor more. Until this point, the poor blamed each other. The ruling class oppressed them and convinced them that it was always someone else’s fault.

Eventually, the ruling class squeezed too hard. People began to get angry, and the elite didn’t have the ability to maintain their lies. Then, people began realizing they had power. They could use their voices in unison. “If the Americans can do it, why can’t I?”  They bonded and realized that it was the ruling class that was to blame. They organized, and they woke up. By establishing community, they established their power as the people, and they used this power to make heads roll.

PUBGConsole,fg0zjqs,t3_ew2ijd,1580418063.0,"I’ve only played five games so far, but here’s what I’ve noticed.

Meds on Miramar and Erangel are extremely limited. Looted all of Military and Pecado, found two first aids. Minimal fighting in town and nobody landed Military twice, so I doubt many were used up. Got maybe two first aids total each time, 5 bandages. Boosts were plenty at least, but that’s about it.

Guns on both maps are plenty. 4 AKMs on top of Casino. 5.56mm was a bit scarce, but oh well, it happens.

Bullet registration (as far as hits go) seems a lot better. No more bullets hitting and no damage being taken. However, I have noticed a large amount of ghost bullets (bullets passing through the person but hitting the objects behind.) I am unsure of why this happening, but it has happened against about 2 out of every 10 players I’ve seen. When it does happen, it’s usually for most of the magazine. I have tested this in training mode as well. It’s an annoyance, but manageable with patience as it seems to be mutual for both firing parties.

When laying prone and returning to a crouch or standing, for a few seconds after the animation is completed, I have been unable to fire. This applies to all maps.

In Karakin, footsteps above ground are impossibly quiet. This was an issue on the PTS as well, but I did not see it addressed in the patch notes. People sneaking up on you while sprinting is a pain.

Spike traps on Erangel are still glitched. Deploying them will notify you and your team with a loud deploying sound when someone on the map deploys them, as well as when you are approaching one. While it isn’t a huge issue, it scares me shitless every time.

So far the update has been enjoyable, the game was not nearly as broken as I had expected. Good going."
PUBGConsole,fg0edy7,t1_fg07vbi,1580406045.0,"The Mini is actually a really good gun. With practice, you are able to land 3-4 shots extremely quickly at ~300 ranges, due to its minimal recoil. The practical damage difference between an SKS and Mini is negligible compared to the accuracy of the Mini. It is not meant for slow single taps, though."
PUBGConsole,fg0dxo0,t3_ew6k2m,1580405774.0,"Not the Mini’s fault, the game/server’s fault.

You fired a total of 6 *visible* rounds, and hit 4.

1st: Miss.
2nd: Neck shot. Shot wasn’t counted by server.
3rd: Torso shot. Shot counted.
4th: Pelvis shot. Shot counted.
5th: Miss.
6th: Knee shot. Shot not counted due to desync, as the server had registered you dead first despite firing before the opponent.

Another thing I noticed is that you seemingly fired 4 ghost bullets. Just as you die, the game appears to change your ammo count from 24 to 20. There may be other reasons for this, however.

All in all, I believe the guy would still be walking away with 20-30 health, but it is a good demonstration of how shitty PUBG servers are."

There’s no way to prove or disprove the rape part of it, but the focal point of this post was clearly him giving her herpies, which seems unlikely given she has had continuous (and publicized) unprotected sex since before his first ever meet and greet. The chances that she specifically asked him to have protected sex in the first place is unlikely. This casts doubt on the allegation, and it’s only the beginning."
HoboJohnson,ffy5xfx,t1_ffxf2cl,1580339173.0,"Yeah, there are pictures of her having unprotected sex with people as bad back as May 2016. This supposedly happened after a meet and greet, which would at least place it in November 2016 (I can’t find an earlier date that he had a meet and greet.) This means that, if she really has herpies, it could be from any of said partners, and there is nothing to say she got it from him. As well, if she contracted it from a partner in that timespan, what about all of the other partners she had unprotected sex with afterwards? She doesn’t have anything saying she has herpies before that post, but she also clearly isn’t shying away from having someone on Twitter announce it in a high profile case that actually benefits her popularity. 

As a SA victim myself, I initially believed it, but upon investigating frankly it doesn’t add up at all and the evidence is strongly against her."

PUBGConsole,fec8wir,t1_fe71t1i,1578968717.0,"Uh, no. I’m wired, I have great internet. It’s desync. I still get it out the ass. It is 100% their fault they have shitty fucking servers and refuse to do anything about it except make the problem worse by moving the physical servers around."
AskReddit,fec3z95,t1_feazh7r,1578966314.0,"Good comment, perhaps one of the only ones here. It’s important to realize that those thoughts you’re having are conditioned. When I dated my first girlfriend, I had to overcome a lot of those thoughts as well, because I didn’t know she was trans until a month after we started dating. It takes time, you just gotta realize that while they may be different down there, they are still individual people just like us, and they don’t owe us shit."
AskReddit,fec309o,t3_eo83cx,1578965915.0,"If they are pre-op? For their own safety, absolutely. You never know who is going to hurt you, and if they kill you once the pants go off, chances are they’re going to get away with it.  Goes for trans men, too. 

If they are post-op? If it’s just sex, no. Not at all. There is no practical reason for that. The only reason someone who you’re about to fuck and forget would care about what your vagina/penis used to be is because they’re transphobic, and that’s their problem, not yours.

If it’s meant to be a relationship, yeah, it should be disclosed *when you trust them.* Don’t disclose to someone you think will hurt you for it."
anime,febvl81,t1_feba6p5,1578963225.0,"Or, and this will definitely blow your mind, they do think it is, but the amount of peer pressure from weebs angry that anime is becoming something for everyone overpowers their love and analysis of a show"
anime,feb5l6l,t3_eo3eq6,1578955655.0,"The problem with popular voted lists is that more recent shows always secure a top spot, because not enough time has passed to kill the hype. However, your list is completely subjective, and no more valid. Yes, I read the statement, but that doesn’t change the fact that a lot of the shows you put on your list are there purely because you think they fell through the cracks. In reality, they didn’t, they were recognized for their strengths, but also recognized as just not that good. The only show I see up there that is rarely talked about is Shiki (which is also not that good and doesn’t deserve a spot anywhere in the top 300, let alone 50, as much as I love it.) You also neglect to mention shows that are both insanely popular but also very good, which I assume is intentional. Mainstream doesn’t make great shows any less great

This is a list of recommendations, not a Top TV Anime of the Decade list. Your title is shit"
anime,feb31bq,t1_feaomfr,1578954977.0,Most people completely neglect to mention because apparently “popular and mainstream” means you can’t put it on a Top 10 list.
gaming,fe9zyvw,t1_fe9fm57,1578942982.0,"Exactly, you have to give someone personal time, whether that be gaming or any other hobby.

On the flip side though (for all those using this to justify ignoring their SO), you can’t game all the time and neglect your relationship until it’s time to sleep. You need to find a balance. I was in a relationship with a guy that only ever wanted to game with his friends, and any attempt to get “us” time was met with the same argument"
PrequelMemes,fe9xwql,t1_fe9sm7h,1578942424.0,I don’t know how to explain just how much of a logical fallacy that first sentence is. Taking logical arguments to a hypothetical extreme is pointless
PrequelMemes,fe9ml8x,t1_fe711ew,1578939427.0,"Nope. Both trilogies have their issues and things that make them a quality experience. It is not possible to put them on such a metric.

Only a Sith deals in absolutes"

anime,fdzf82c,t1_fdvm77u,1578789646.0,"I definitely see where you’re coming from, but big, beautiful fights take a lot of time and cost a lot of money, and I just don’t think there’s enough budget there to do that multiple times in a seasonal show. They did the best that they could, and they have treated this show amazingly so far, and I have no doubts they will continue to do so."
