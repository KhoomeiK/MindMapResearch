I have both the oral b and sonicare toothbrushes (not sure what model, both have bluetooth) and there's a big difference. 

Sonicare is AMAZING. My teeth feel like that post prophy feel every day. Only thing that sucks is if you bump your teeth with the plastic part. It's like nails on a chalkboard

Oralb is mediocre at best. The vibration is totally different and feels really rough. Even on the gentlest setting it feels like I'mma damage something. I think I'd rather use a manual again than that 

full disclosure: I got them both free in dental school and don't get paid shit by either company. I do sometimes get free shit at our annual meeting but it's in mini toothpaste, cheap pens, and lip balm"

>cant be helped

Does not compute. 

Unless it's pregnancy or whatever induced, gingivitis can be helped. It's called brushing and flossing.

Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gums due to irritation from bacteria that was ineffectively removed"
