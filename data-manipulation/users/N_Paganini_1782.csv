HeroHunters,fbr0upz,t3_ee5w43,1577037799.0,"All hero's are good if you upgrade. I recommend you the use at least one shielding hero and one healing hero in your team; you can use any type for the other three slots. The hero with more base power are usually better. I personally have bolt, maven, cinder, matador (healer), butter (shielder), 4cep, Alvarez, heckler, and brogan (extra health) as my most used hero's. You should upgrade everyone though so you can do better in gauntlet and limited hero PvP events and other events."
