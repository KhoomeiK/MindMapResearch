It is what it is with BFV at this point."

worldnews,fg7y3rm,t1_fg7wub5,1580604447.0,I’m far from it. But the Palestinians at some point have to recognize their weak negotiating position and just take a deal. The Arab world isn’t as united behind their cause anymore and has other priorities. A deal is better than no deal

GermanWW2photos,ffvqrof,t1_ffvqh89,1580270648.0,"Early on 1 September 1939, Germany launched an invasion of Poland. Schleswig-Holstein had been positioned in the port of Danzig, moored close to the Polish ammunition depot at Westerplatte under the guise of a ceremonial visit in August. Around 04:47 on 1 September, Schleswig-Holstein opened fire with her main battery at the Polish positions on the Westerplatte, and in doing so fired the first shots of World War II.”

Ok, this makes sense - she was moored up already to disguise her true mission. Explains the starboard anchor down"
GermanWW2photos,ffvqh89,t3_evaqnl,1580270429.0,Are we sure about the caption and it’s origin? The ship is at anchor. Just seems like an unusual thing to do when in battle - wouldn’t allow for a quick escape. Just curious.
