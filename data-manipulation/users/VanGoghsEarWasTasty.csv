facepalm,fdj4t4s,t1_fdj1i0b,1578458457.0,I mean... Yeah.

1. Not coin slots, 100% free machine you just turn the knob.

2. Not abandoned or neglected. They were restocked regularly. 

3. They're all over campus. This person just had to walk to the next building or bathroom in the same building if it was broken. 

4. Those are not jammed, they're taped on the glass so you can read the back or see the color.

5. Yes. This is in Florida."

AskReddit,eo128j1,t3_bq2sd5,1558190015.0,"Former Segway and Ghost Tour guide in New Orleans. I have a ton of stories, mostly of people not on the tours coming up to us like the usual mentally ill homeless and drunk tourists. It gets easier to deal with those people. 

Aside from crashing Segways into each other and passing out from heat exhaustion (you're in New Orleans please drink more water and don't wear bunny suits), my people really couldn't do much damage because my crew and I we're really good at people wrangling. 
 

It was part of our usual Segway route to stop at Saint Louis Number 2 cemetery, park the Segways, and walk in as we couldn't ride them in (no wheeled vehicles aside from hearses and the employee van.) I give my spiel in the main alleyway then take them to a dilapidated crypt a few rows back. This crypt is still standing, but the entire front wall is gone. It either fascinates or grosses out the guests. 

This one guest was too fascinated and decided to climb inside to take a picture. Keep in mind I've already told them in these cases the remains may still be in there, just covered up with dirt. She didn't give two shits and just climbed right into this thing that 1, is a grave 2, is about to collapse any second."
