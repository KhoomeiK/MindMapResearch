My oldest is 3 now and, even when he fell head first from a standing position onto my Arwen as she lay on my lap while I was sitting on the floor, she only batted him with her paw, never once did any of my cats put a claw out towards the boys.  I have pictures of both of my girls laying on my collar bone while I nursed my youngest who is almost 10 months.  Sadly, out of the three cats we had when my oldest was born, only one is still with us.  Something to watch out for though is both of my girls had their claw covers fall off naturally.  I assumed my boy did too until my MIL pointed out that they hadn’t and a couple had grown into his pads.  I had to cut his claws VERY carefully and those claws were always thicker after that until he passed.  Thankfully his pads were ok."

TalesFromYourServer,ffjs59s,t3_eu07tp,1580005472.0,"I work for a company that suddenly closed several locations a couple of years ago.  The GMs and AGMs were told the night before at 7:00 that the restaurants would not be opening the next morning.  But I also know of a location that was closing and had at least several days notice.  I think the fear is that if notice is given, employees will simply stop showing up to work because, if they’re closing anyway, there’s no ramifications if they’re not planning on transferring.  We had a delivery company that closed the warehouse that serviced us and they gave their employees notice and most of their employees walked and it was a horrific couple of weeks of late deliveries and mispicks because there just weren’t enough employees left.  And the ones who were left gave zero fucks because they were losing their jobs anyway."

The other because my toddler was sick and I didn’t want to risk it.  Unfortunately, most of the kids in the family happened to be sick that weekend so no one from our side made it.

TalesFromYourServer,fdfcffw,t3_ekxgxb,1578358406.0,"I had a woman one time try to get around the “extra” rule by saying she wanted “ more” sauce and “more” cheese.  When I repeated her order back, I said extra sauce & cheese and and she said she didn’t want extra, she wanted more.  More means extra!"
ShitMomGroupsSay,fdctyka,t3_eklbmq,1578284238.0,"Answering no to all of those questions for a 17 month old really isn’t that impressive IMO.  I can answer no to them all for my fully vaccinated 3-year-old.  He gets colds and like 1-2 ear infections per year.  Yes, I know how lucky I am that he is healthy but most toddlers don’t have chronic conditions or have had surgery."

I noped out emotionally when there started to be a lot of made for TV movies that featured people chanting who were in cults and to my 10-year-Old mind I was like the Catholic Church is a cult!

They tried to get me to baptize my oldest but I held firm on no and, after two years and when my second was born, they finally gave up."

I loved it, it saved me so much time and money because I was planning better and not making impulse buys!  Sadly she transferred to another store that’s not on my way home."
Parenting,fd6k8ok,t3_ejz909,1578192289.0,In terms of the shopping cart you are 100% right.  My friend saw a man pushing a toddler (18 months or so) in a cart and the baby fell out on its head onto the concrete floor.  She said she’ll never forget the sound.

There is STILL purple glitter embedded in her dining room table.  As a direct result, I have a strict no glitter policy in my house."
