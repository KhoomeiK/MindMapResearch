Unlawful means doing something not in the authorized way, illegal means something explicitly prohibited.

Jumping a fence instead of going through a checkpoint is unlawful because there are means to accomplish the same thing, whereas killing someone is explicitly prohibited with no way around it that is authorized."
Economics,ffih2fo,t1_ffigijt,1579973701.0,"Yes it ramps up but the local population ramps up as well, there's a 1.7% increase per year in local population of the US, so with immigrants you get something around a 2% increase, of which immigrants make up 15%.

Mexico was also close the same year peaking at 8.5k

Then it reversed unfortunately, but Latin America is not as poor as believed.

Hell, there are multiple states and cities in Latin America with a higher HDI than Tenesse or some other southern US state I don't recall right now

The middle East was stable for contemporary standards under the ottoman empire up until ww1, same with Africa which started independence movements during the second half of this century.

Latin America is no longer under direct military conflict since a hundred years, they were formed 200 hundred years ago.
