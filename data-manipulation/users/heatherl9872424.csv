90DayFiance,ffui5d7,t3_eva2je,1580242452.0,Robert verbally cutting down a woman because of his own insecurities? I find that hard to believe. /s
antiMLM,fftljet,t3_ev4bah,1580223642.0,If they are not paying FICA taxes then they are admitting to committing tax fraud on social media. Good thing for them that this post is most likely doctored and not actual income.
antiMLM,ffske5f,t3_euzmw1,1580183876.0,Wtf
antiMLM,ffskc35,t3_ev00gs,1580183833.0,"It sounds like it could honestly be any of them. It doesn’t have a lot of the buzzwords that specify one particular MLM like mentors (Amway), coach (BB), etc. Pretty generic copy/pastes."
fatlogic,ffooiya,t1_ffoo6xk,1580079954.0,Gross. Who keeps giving trash people like this their own shows?
relationships,ffocymn,t3_eudlj9,1580076409.0,Don’t reach out. Ever. Take the lessons you learned from this and be a better person in the future.
90DayFiance,ffocbur,t3_eudgk1,1580076192.0,I consider it a business arrangement. She found someone willing to have the secks with her (albeit only once apparently) and he found someone willing to throw a K1 his way to get him over here. Win win.
antiMLM,ffob655,t3_eudkoe,1580075890.0,What a piece of shit. These guys have no moral compass.
ChoosingBeggars,ffo9v5f,t1_ffnuqx5,1580075503.0,"It’s a pyramid scheme. The only people shelling out the money for YL or DoTerra are the sellers that have to buy a certain amount to hit their quota every month. People who actually know about essential oils and who legitimately use them buy them online for way less, not from Karen on Facebook."
antiMLM,ffo42ov,t3_euczdo,1580073916.0,"One of my coworkers has pushed 6 different MLMs in the time I’ve worked with her and my best advice is just to avoid any non work related interactions. Don’t ask about their weekend, don’t hang out one on one after work, etc. it gives them fewer chances to try to recruit you."
90DayFiance,ffnxpm5,t3_euc28u,1580072098.0,Anything to stay relevant
relationships,ffnthxj,t3_euc585,1580070595.0,Good for you standing up for yourself. People will only take advantage of you if you let them. If she continues to try to trample your boundaries or treat you poorly then it might be time for you to find a different job.
weddingshaming,ffnq6aj,t3_eubyjo,1580069256.0,"This sounds incredibly tacky, especially if a lot of those people won’t be invited to the wedding. And even for those invited if I’m going to be shelling out money for a wedding gift I probably wouldn’t also go to an engagement party that charged a cover. At that point it sounds like a giant money grab."
fatlogic,ffnpdci,t3_eub6wk,1580068923.0,Don’t post pictures of yourself in your underwear on social media then. Problem solved.
antiMLM,ffno3jr,t3_eublke,1580068405.0,One of the huns is going to steal this and try to use it for recruiting
antiMLM,ffhbma6,t3_etm63y,1579928984.0,They all copy and paste what the other huns post. Nothing is original.
antiMLM,ffcouu3,t3_esx3iz,1579804047.0,Very professional

antiMLM,ffbzszd,t1_ffbx4wz,1579787843.0,"It sounds like OP meant that the Roth IRA contributions were set up on ACH to pull from their bank account monthly, and when the account didn’t have enough the bank was charging a $30 overdraft fee. This person sounds very young and it’s probably their first time overdrawing a bank account. It’s messed up that the mom did this and didn’t explain that this would happen if the bank account was short."
antiMLM,ffb9jx5,t3_esogkq,1579756237.0,That’s fucked up. Poor grandma.
antiMLM,ffb6zkq,t3_esnvnf,1579753479.0,"If you’re already at the bottom there’s not much lower you can go, might as well alienate anyone left who doesn’t already hate you"

antiMLM,ff27f41,t3_er807i,1579495961.0,Oh the irony
weddingshaming,fewfy35,t3_eqruiv,1579409939.0,For every shitty guy out there somehow there’s always a woman with low enough self esteem to keep standing by their side no matter what they do. It’s sad.
MarriedAtFirstSight,fewfckz,t1_few58s0,1579409659.0,But how else would the viewers figure out whether or not those marriages are legally binding??
antiMLM,fewdgjp,t3_eqrhks,1579408761.0,I wonder if her neck is getting tired from bending over to kiss her own ass for that long of a stretch
antiMLM,few7ize,t3_eqqaws,1579406450.0,At least she admits she is annoying. They might be starting to become self aware.
antiMLM,fevuu09,t3_eqqlq0,1579401802.0,Yikes she would get more takers if she didn’t post a pic. Those are horrendous.
fatlogic,feuyftt,t1_feur3rw,1579391171.0,But her body will literally break down and die without Coke /s
fatlogic,feuy4vq,t3_eqob2b,1579391071.0,Not to be an armchair psychologist but it sounds like this person might have a legit mental illness and their food habits/overeating is a symptom of it rather than the cause. Because this is not normal at all and this habit of associating exercise with anxiety or pain should never be normalized.
antiMLM,feut0we,t3_eqkzbu,1579389649.0,Most of the huns I know IRL go from one scheme to another constantly. Each new upline convinces them that the last one failed because of the previous company and not because of the business model so they never learn. I work with a girl who is on her 6th MLM since I’ve known her.
antiMLM,feuslmu,t3_eql8ia,1579389536.0,Somehow I doubt that any of them are making money off of LLR these days

antiMLM,fesaoao,t1_fesaimz,1579363306.0,Good point
antiMLM,fesackd,t3_eqhovf,1579363197.0,Yikes is this hun allergic to vowels? How much time is she saving not typing those out? Especially since this same message is being copied and pasted over and over.
antiMLM,fepig33,t3_eqbor2,1579321322.0,The photos they post are all edited. From what I’ve heard IRL and also seen on this sub it doesn’t work any better than stuff you would buy in the drugstore and it is only expensive because it is an MLM so they have to pay 20 layers of upline from each purchase.
antiMLM,fejzpgd,t3_epix35,1579189492.0,They all do this. Check out the Primerica reviews online for a laugh
antiMLM,fejzlp9,t3_epjnb6,1579189428.0,Seems legit /s
antiMLM,feixt7e,t3_epbj0n,1579150194.0,So if their shampoo makes your hair fall out does that mean this poor woman’s skin is going to start peeling off tomorrow?
antiMLM,feix1sw,t3_epe9lp,1579149565.0,Ugh I got one of these this week from someone I never once spoke to in high school 20 years ago who is now clamoring for my husband and I to meet him and his gf for dinner and who wants to hear all about my life goals. I’m just waiting for the Amway pitch to finish dropping so I can shut it down.

antiMLM,fedc7ot,t3_eojtil,1579007316.0,I’m sure the AutoZone manager would be interested to know that one of their workers is pushing Amway on their customers.
antiMLM,feckxur,t3_eog51o,1578976454.0,This is so fucked up. How incredibly cruel to try to prey on vulnerable women like this. That would be a really beautiful picture without the Scentsy bs.
antiMLM,fe84uko,t3_eo450v,1578922591.0,She’s almost self aware enough to admit that everyone just books their own trips online in 2020. Almost.
antiMLM,fe3oc01,t3_enq9yg,1578851272.0,"In a way she’s right, it “deliveries” results like no other because it’s the only product on the market that makes your hair fall out."
antiMLM,fe3ntff,t3_enqago,1578851166.0,Buying into an MLM is literally creating another residual bill and the only residual income it generates is basically a refund of part of your own money. More flawed logic.
antiMLM,fe3gsti,t3_enprk8,1578849097.0,This seems like a really expensive and shitty way to get fans. I’m sure one of them sells it and is doing this to boost their numbers.
relationships,fe25vb6,t1_fe235up,1578834769.0,Because he is lying about it. A customs agent doesn’t accidentally use a different country’s passport stamp.
antiMLM,fe1vtzb,t3_enk2tx,1578831486.0,I’m sick of them acting like they are saving the world or curing cancer by joining an MLM. I know she got this script from her upline and didn’t write it herself but it’s obnoxious.
antiMLM,fe04k1g,t3_enhsaq,1578802902.0,She sounds terrible. Not just as a hun but as a person to deal with in general.
antiMLM,fe04fjn,t3_enhxjx,1578802813.0,The mentor and online marketplace parts sound like Amway but they usually are couples targeting other couples so maybe it’s a different MLM copying some of their tricks.
antiMLM,fdx4bz6,t1_fdx35l1,1578765191.0,A singer in the US who got famous from being on American Idol. She’s not involved an an MLM but the hun is saying that her auditioning for the show and making it big is like someone joining an MLM and being successful. Flawed hun logic because there were hundreds of thousands of people who tried out for that show and maybe a half dozen that actually became successful from it over the years.
antiMLM,fdx2gir,t3_enafrc,1578764624.0,"So she’s “claiming” $10,000 per month but admits she’s actually not even turning a profit and still buried in debt? Weird flex but ok."
90DayFiance,fdw6ft6,t3_en86pd,1578755525.0,I like when people point this stuff out because I think I need the reminder that most reality tv is not actually real. As long as it isn’t 100% obviously scripted and fake like some of them out there I don’t mind some producer manipulation especially if it makes the show more interesting. But the bad acting on other reality shows has made me tune out of them entirely so it’s a fine line.
antiMLM,fdw328a,t1_fdvnm53,1578754565.0,Seriously I feel bad for those poor kids living in this scented hell 24/7.
antiMLM,fdo1mb0,t3_emcczk,1578597222.0,"Wrong, wrong, and wrong."
antiMLM,fdj2ppt,t1_fdj1r57,1578456896.0,Yeah even taking the pyramid scheme aspect out of it the idea of sitting around talking about sex toys with people I know is my personal hell.  Not everyone feels comfortable being part of something like this and that excuse is harder to argue with than the pre programmed “every job is a pyramid” hunspeak.
antiMLM,fdh87lc,t1_fdgybsk,1578417486.0,"If they have your social security number they can potentially still take you to collections and impact your credit score, whether you paid with a debit or credit card. Not worth the risk."
antiMLM,fdgmzte,t3_el7eg2,1578402730.0,Amway is the worst.
antiMLM,fdgmwgw,t3_el9mjc,1578402645.0,“Unbiased”
antiMLM,fdgmrtw,t3_elb6s8,1578402530.0,Never deal with the scammer who signed you up. Always deal directly with the company (if the website isn’t working I would call customer service next) to cancel and take notes of who you spoke with and dates and times in case the refund doesn’t go through. Then if that doesn’t work contact your bank to dispute the charges and to get a new card number if that is the card they charged for the fees.
JUSTNOMIL,fdfuvme,t3_el5bzq,1578370837.0,Unfortunately I had to be to avoid the inevitable guilt trip. But it’s always delightful seeing her post vague passive aggressive Facebook statuses that are totally “not” about me. /s
antiMLM,fdfui39,t3_el5zwu,1578370551.0,What a steaming pile of bullshit that is. As if pushing an MLM wasn’t bad enough.
antiMLM,fdfpn77,t3_el56qo,1578367198.0,If your “financial advisor” (family or not) tries to recruit you to also do their job then that person is not a real financial advisor.
antiMLM,fddnhqt,t3_ektmuv,1578318697.0,Facebook is horrible. Time to start clicking on every puppy and kitten related post to cleanse the palette.
antiMLM,fdcrd1q,t3_ek7m3l,1578282152.0,He’s definitely nowhere near the top of the pyramid unless he’s like 50 now. Only people that got in decades ago made any money with Herbalife. It would be impossible to get anywhere near the top of the pyramid if someone started in the past few years.
antiMLM,fdclz9v,t1_fdcis4l,1578278217.0,Dude why are you spamming every post with comments about Neutrogena? It’s not even an MLM.
antiMLM,fdckjb4,t3_ekmkm6,1578277185.0,"Ignoring the weirdness that spun out in this post’s early comments, it might not help if you try to talk sense into your friends. When they are new to it and freshly brainwashed it can be almost impossible to counteract that because MLMs teach them to ignore the “haters” and to keep pushing forward anyway. It’s best to just not do anything to support them (even a pity buy) and eventually they will learn on their own."
antiMLM,fdcb2im,t3_eklrft,1578270714.0,"It’s always sad to see a 39 year old woman playing make believe with her pretend business, but the pretend title really tops it off."

antiMLM,fdawzuw,t3_ekcezi,1578251368.0,"What the hell. I can see Z-list reality stars falling into this shit when the #ad money starts drying up, but with her career she doesn’t need to do this to pay the bills."
antiMLM,fd9t67n,t1_fd9nhtp,1578237702.0,Wait does this mean that the supplement/oilogy courses they take don’t make them real medical doctors? /s
fatlogic,fd9ovex,t1_fd9kqa5,1578236207.0,How long until a few doctors start marketing themselves as HAES friendly or something like that to build a niche market giving out shitty medical advice to people that don’t want to hear the truth? They could make a lot of money until their patients start dying at higher rates from being told it’s ok to stay obese.
antiMLM,fd9n1iy,t1_fd8qchs,1578235556.0,There’s also been a few posts in this sub of huns working from their hospital bed while in labor or immediately after having their baby. No thank you.
90DayFiance,fd71utv,t3_ek7oza,1578198409.0,"I’m sorry you had to go through that. I wish that any of these people considered the effect that their actions would have on their kids. This show is basically a case study in terrible parenting (looking at you Ashley, Larissa, Ben, Robert, etc etc etc)."
antiMLM,fd6t69t,t1_fd6rafr,1578195399.0,Same here. I couldn’t imagine anyone looking at her post and being like “yes this is the job I want” haha.

antiMLM,fd6jeau,t3_ek5e81,1578191947.0,A potential free set of $11 nail stickers is a very big price to pay for one’s dignity.

antiMLM,fd4m14f,t3_ek196h,1578168812.0,They need to come up with a less creepy term than “borrow your face”
antiMLM,fd4ln2v,t3_ejm2jt,1578168704.0,Maybe they are going the way of LLR and Jamberry. It’s sad that the actual employees making real paychecks were laid off but it’s a good sign that the MLM trend is hopefully dying.

antiMLM,fcyon01,t3_ejl14a,1578083978.0,It sounds like a place I worked at years ago that was with another life insurance company. Not technically MLM but just a shitty 100% commissioned sales job. They nickel and dimed us with tons of costs to work there and it was very high pressure to sell sell sell. Not a great place to build a career.
antiMLM,fcxbzv3,t3_ejf0o8,1578058737.0,If buying Girl Scout cookies puts you in danger of going broke you need to reevaluate your life choices. They are not very expensive.
antiMLM,fcxbugf,t3_ejf7hs,1578058608.0,This logic though. They keep saying not to listen to your friends or worry about what they think. But this is a business that literally relies on conning the people you know into joining so if they think it’s a scam you’re kind of f*ed.
antiMLM,fcw7dan,t1_fcw6ww3,1578018833.0,It’s easiest not to insert logic into it. These ideas came from the same geniuses telling the huns to have people put toxic oils on their pets and innocent babies and to take oils internally.
antiMLM,fcw5lxl,t3_ej8dg0,1578017695.0,I hate when they say “play with makeup” it’s so infantalizing. These are all grown ass women talking like middle schoolers.

antiMLM,fcw44o5,t3_ej80gw,1578016712.0,Maybe it’s like the Nigerian scammers. The dumbed down posts weed out the smart people who know how to do research and think for themselves.
antiMLM,fcvhm8g,t3_ej4v19,1578002266.0,At least she is admitting to wasting money and being a lunatic. Hopefully everyone in the group can see through her bs.

antiMLM,fcu7ks4,t3_eiyonl,1577974439.0,"A lot of them join churches to prey on their members, so these posts give the perception of relatability and to try to make them look more devout to their target audience."
