AskReddit,ff58jsw,t3_erpsmg,1579583422.0,"I've confidently felt for a very long time that I would be far more comfortable and confident if I was a woman. I'm sure you could track those thoughts to having an abusive, absent father and other bad male role models in my life but I also don't feel that I'm in the wrong body per say. I would just prefer to be the opposite sex."

You have different ingredients you can use though and every hero respond differently to different combinations so you need to know what works best and for who. Don't want to give the wrong soup to someone who needs a max heal and instead gets a flimsy 10hp or, even worse, a stomach ache."
