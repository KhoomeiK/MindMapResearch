Maybe it turns into a physical fight, maybe it doesnt. I missed seeing  a fight where the chick ended up in the hospital, she was talkin shit about the toughest girl in school and she got ended. Actually kinda glad I missed that one, I'm sure it was horrifying.   My old friends still talk about it to this day"

AskReddit,ffg1fk7,t3_etbrdf,1579896379.0,"I had a cat called Elric that would go into the shower with me. Damn near every time, you could expect him to appear in the tub with you. I would be washing my hair and I would feel his furry self against my leg. He would sit there under the water stream, do a few laps and then exit. 
I moved in with my mom and he surprised the hell out of her one day by sneaking in the shower with her. She still cant believe any cat would do that! But there he was."

Now I look forward to every night when kiddo is asleep. I roll up a joint, get music/Netflix going on my phone, sit back and relax. Then I eat snacks and have some milk and its bed time!
