Well first off, I didn't say *what* he said, so I don't know why you're arguing with that. I don't see a source on your quote so I assume you are referring to his response to the controversy? This is the original account:

>Sanders responded that he did not believe a woman could win.

Right wingers are conservatives. So if a fraction of them believe something, it's a conservative fantasy. In any event, it's not my responsibility to deprogram anybody.

>That wasn't my point. My point was that maybe you should ask yourself why this ""wrong belief"" about your position crops up in arguments you are having with people who don't share your ideology.

I don't consider myself to have an ideology, because I don't look to any authority to believe what I do. To answer your comment though, conservatives spend a lot of time spreading propaganda about what liberals believe. I choose to ignore it.

>So yes, in this ***specific*** case, you said that, ""Him having white Privilege"" (B) caused ""Him to make to make ignorant statements""

Caused is perhaps a bad word. It facilitated his ignorance. He made the choice to speak out, however.

Half the population doesn't think that, a small fraction of right wingers do. It's not my responsibility to correct their backwards thoughts about me.

You haven't proven me wrong either.

>""C"" means ""You are making ignorant statements"".

I said that, in this instance, Gilliam is making ignorant statements because he is unaware of his privilege.

>Since A causes B and B causes C, it follows that A causes C.

B doesn't cause C. Having privilege doesn't automatically cause you to make ignorant statements. You could acknowledge your privilege and not make ignorant statements. You could also ignore your privilege, and also choose not to make ignorant statements. 

The common thread here is ignorant statements. That's all he's being called out for.

No, not true at all. White people can be victimized too. They're not victims of racial oppression, though. That's ridiculous.

>since one is either a victim or an oppressor

This is a conservative fantasy. Liberals don't think in this binary way.

>he must damm well accept his status in the intersectional hierarchy and stop being so individualistic about it.

a) He's not being individualistic, he's playing identity politics.

b) He doesn't have to accept anything. But Silverstein doesn't have to remain silent if Gilliam says something ignorant, either. She's allowed to call him out. He can deal with that, or not. They're just tweets. It's not a big deal.

No, I don't agree, that's very reductive. What I would say is that, because he has white privilege, he is not necessarily aware of all of the issues POC face. This itself is not the worst thing in the world, although he should try to educate himself.

He said this *after* he was called out for those comments. And like I said, they were taken out of context. I'm not saying that he is sexist. He was surely saying that with sexism being how it is, people wouldn't elect a woman. But I do think he did say it. This is coming from someone who is a Bernie supporter and fan.

Buddhism as it is practiced has problematic aspects to it. The Dalai Lama is pretty sexist. But there's it's more complicated than just ""patriarchy"" and ""oppressed minority."" This is what I mean when I say your understanding is one dimensional. 

>Also, Christianity came from the Jews. So it’s originally not even a western idea.

This is a profoundly ignorant statement.

That's not what people are referring to when they refer to cultural appropriation. Jesus Christ you're uninformed.

I never called Christianity evil of said that it was the cause of everything wrong with society.

>Also, if the west is so patriarchal, why is there so much freedom and equality for women compared to the rest of the world? 

Just because we've come a long way, doesn't mean we're there yet. Also, some western countries are better than others.
