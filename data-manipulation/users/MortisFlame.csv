We can work with that!” Because people with STDs are still people and deserve to be treated as such. But I wasn’t really sure, deep down, and regretting not calling it off then and there. Some shit went down later so I had a different reason to cut her off but I wish I’d known what to say when she told me that, or I wish I could’ve been okay with it."
depression,fdzy1sd,t3_enefu5,1578798598.0,"Are you me? 

I feel the same way, lately. My life has no real direction. Most of my close friendships have fallen apart and I don’t really want to be around people anymore. I don’t have a partner, or family, or a job I care about. Nothing genuinely interests me, it’s like all my hobbies are just to distract me from the emptiness I feel. 

What’s even the point?"
AskReddit,fdzwd3i,t3_endd07,1578797385.0,Don’t be afraid to make the first move. A lot of guys are shy and really want you to.
LawSchool,fdhfjt9,t1_fdgiu9y,1578421582.0,"Thank you! I do have questions and will probably reach out to you, soon. You are the second person to recommend University of Oregon to me."
LawSchool,fdg5wqd,t3_el7uau,1578381300.0,That’s okay since I’m not all that interested in policy making. My real interest is in Indigenous water rights. I’ve read some places that environmental lawyers are going to be in demand in coming years due to the effects of climate change.
depression,fdg4cp8,t3_cml6ni,1578379532.0,Nothing in my life makes sense. I’ve come so far and yet it feels like I’m in the same place. I just want to stop existing because it feels like I’ll never get to experience anything but this emptiness.
depression,fdg4a94,t3_ekwbox,1578379457.0,I wish my suicide attempt had succeeded all the time.
depression,fdg46t2,t3_ekqsl7,1578379352.0,"I was in the same boat when I was your age. Now I’m 26, have my degree, and I’m still alone. Never found that person for me; some people never do. I doubt you’ll have the same problems I have so don’t worry. But don’t expect things to just fall into place once you graduate, either. If you want a relationship/partner, it’s just like applying for jobs. You gotta put yourself out there, you gotta face rejection, and you gotta work."
depression,fdg419h,t3_el23c3,1578379186.0,"Sometimes at work I feel like one of those animatronics, just going through the same robotic motions over and over."
depression,fdg3ycq,t3_ekpvdz,1578379101.0,Good luck. Hope you find that person.
depression,fdg3ud1,t3_eksegv,1578378983.0,"Happened to me. It was the main reason I attempted suicide, too. But hell with ‘em, they weren’t really my friends. They never once checked up on me, although one still stalks my LinkedIn profile. Maybe he feels guilty. Just work on making yourself into the person you want to be and you’ll attract the right people to you. And pretty soon your old “friends” will regret not treating you with the respect you deserved."
single,fdg16di,t3_el6e5o,1578376264.0,How do you do that?? My hair is so straight I can’t get it to stay in a bun
AskReddit,fdg08y0,t1_fdg01ob,1578375374.0,"I have a degree in English, but my concentrated study was in rhetoric which I’ve been told is a good foundation for law."
dating_advice,f86ueux,t1_f86syom,1574307176.0,That makes me feel a bit better.
