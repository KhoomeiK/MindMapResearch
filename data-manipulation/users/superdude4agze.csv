JDM,fg0hzbd,t1_fg0gl46,1580408185.0,"No worries. We all (SC owners) wish they had come with the Supra Turbo's V160, but alas no such luck for the NA motor the SC300 got handed."
todayilearned,fg0hvif,t1_fg0hdik,1580408125.0,"No doubt about the desperation part. I was watching one of Vice's minidocs about rare cannabis harvesting and during a portion where it seemed like the locals were about to kill the guys that are making millions from these never before seen (by the outside world) strains they came to take the seeds of, one of them admitted that while they pay a couple hundred bucks to get to the plants absolutely zero goes back to the people that got them there and ""that's just how the world works""."

todayilearned,fg0gs62,t1_ffzqqh8,1580407484.0,And the twitter account/website linked in the article is selling it for $100 for a 100g bottle. I wonder how much they're paying the guys that actually harvest it. I'm sure it's commensurate with the price they're charging... ^^/s

hobbycnc,ffz4m8n,t1_ffyxvtr,1580363802.0,Disagreeing with someone doesn't make it white knighting. I've already explained the rest and issues regarding it. Can't force you to see things from another point of view. Perhaps time for you to go back to just watching YouTube and let others form your opinions for you since experience doesn't seem to be an asset of yours.
hobbycnc,ffyw549,t1_ffyjo99,1580356640.0,"Options are not always the best.

Options require sourcing, QA, testing, stocking, overhead, risk.... the list goes on.

Openbuilds isn't Amazon. Openbuilds isn't McMasterCarr. 

""They don't do exactly what I want them to do so I'm going to throw a hissy fit"" isn't a valid position to hold, but I see that you're just set in your little ways about this and probably just need to move on. 

Have a good day."

By reading the official rules document for the contest. You know the one in the link at the end of the tweet.

    Prizes; Random Drawing; Odds of Winning: For each sack that occurs in the NFL Super Bowl LIV, Sponsor 
    will give away a 1 (one) year supply of Trojan Brand condoms, which prize will be awarded to each winner 
    as a total of 30 10ct boxes (300 condoms) (approximate retail value (""ARV"") of each prize is $225.00).

> So if you have sex more than once everyday, 300 condoms is enough?

I don't think that's really a worry of yours, now is it?"
