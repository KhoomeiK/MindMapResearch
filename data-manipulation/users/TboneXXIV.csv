backpacking,ffm4i4p,t3_eu5zce,1580048362.0,"For most people, backpacking is achievable if you prioritize, and make, then follow a reasonable plan.

Here are things I have done (and now do) to make it happen for me.  YMMV...

When I worked in a large company where time off just wasn't going to happen for a long trip, I took shorter trips, saved money, and made plans.  My wife and I made and adhered to a budget.  We got serious about reducing our spending, because frankly I had the income.  But I found ways to stretch it even so.  I went on the road for work 50 weeks a year, and they paid for meals and hotels and rental cars and airline tickets, and all that reduced my spending at home.  I didn't buy a single thing on those 5 days of every week that wasn't expensed.  When I arrived home Friday night I had my expense report submitted within 15 minutes of arriving home.  I was usually reimbursed by Tuesday.  All that took a little setting up on my part but it was simple stuff.  I talked to the people who handled that stuff and found out what made their job easier and did that.  Primarily, I put my receipts in the same order as the charges appeared on the expense report.  Simple, but made it fast and easy to verify so I got priority.  I didn't buy anything I didn't need.  My wife was the same.  We ate well, but at home, not in restaurants.  We budgeted for everything and as time went on we got more focused so we realized that we could drop cable TV and save $60/month without missing it.  We trimmed our expenses more and more and saved like this for 4 years.  For 2 years I was on the road implementing labor standards followed by 2 years of opening distribution centers.  I actually loved my work, but not as much as backpacking.  So I left.  That was a 24/7/365 operation where you really can't be gone 6 months to backpack.  

We moved across the country.  Her family had a cabin that was about 100 years old up in northern WI.  She spent summers there as a kid, with her grandparents.  It was near a sprawling national forest.  We vacationed there and it is where we started hiking together.  So we made this crazy plan.  We would save money, go hike the AT, buy the cabin off her family, and open a backpacking store.

So that is where we are now.  We hiked it in 2013.  We bought the cabin from her family.  We opened a backpacking shop.  

It sounds glorious.  Because it is.  It sounds simple, but it isn't.  Took 5 years to sell our old place.  We had a bad renter and a bad property manager simultaneously.  That hurt us.  That cabin is 100 years old.  It has no insulation in the walls.  That sucks when the temp hits -30F.  It's also why we use radiant floor heating.  Which I had to do myself.  Contractors shook their heads and told me no or just didn't call back.  Place had to have a new roof, new septic, new driveway and new well.   We also lifted it and put  a basement under it.  The fixes and mods will last me a lifetime.  So much money...  And it is still a hundred year old cabin, which is both glorious and annoying.  But after 5 years of doing laundry at a laundromat we at least have a laundry room down in the basement to go with our fantastic view of the lake.

The shop, though.  Scary, but fun.  Neither of us had any idea wtf to do.  We knew we would need to do some things.  Others we had no clue about.  Lots of makee,learnee.  Not enough money to buy a building  AND buy inventory.  Definitely no money to pay help.  So - 7 day a week job.  Can't pay rent and then be closed 1 day out of every 7.  Gotta be open early and late so people with jobs can shop with us.  Greet everyone.  Thank everyone.  Get in touch with brands, buy stuff.  Stock and restock shelves.  Minimum orders. Bookwork, accounting.  How to record all this stuff.  Taxes.  How to ring stuff up?  Register, POS, what?  How to accept credit cards?  What's an interchange rate?  So much stuff to learn, do, and find money for...  Always out of money the first five years.  Five years before we could ever withdraw money for ourselves instead of finding more to put in.  

But.  We are our own bosses.  In between running the shop, I have hiked all of Isle Royale, Pictured Rocks, the SHT and countless miles in the national forest as well as wonderful local-ish places like the Porcupine Mtns and Sylvania Wilderness.  The wife has put similar things under her belt.  We really aren't big enough to support a full time manager yet so the only thing neat we hiked together was a bunch of dayhikes on Kauai.  Otherwise one of us is holding down the shop while the other can hike.  

But we are living the dream.

So, start with a plan.  Something that you can follow.  Build from that."

CampingGear,fffq1q8,t1_fffoql6,1579889320.0,"While the initial bacterial load is -probably- a lot smaller, the risks are the same as a regular burger.  It is a highly processed product with lots of surface area exposure in that process to create the right environment for a potentially deadly load of bacteria if it is allowed to sit in the temperature danger zone.

Just because the initial source isn't a cow full of poop, that doesn't mean the burger itself isn't a ripe ground for bacteria to multiply.

While I don't have specific numbers to back up my ""-probably- smaller"" statement, I think that is likely the case.  If I were going to be eating it, I would treat it just like ground beef."
CampingGear,ffflds4,t3_etcpbn,1579886470.0,"Because burgers are a ground neat product as opposed to a whole meat product, a much larger percentage of surface area has been exposed during the grinding process and this makes a burger much more likely to be contaminated with  harmful bacteria, a burger is much more likely to make you ill than a steak is.

Add into the mix that allowing a frozen food to thaw gradually in an unrefrigerated environment places it into the danger zone for bacterial growth for possibly extended periods of time and that you are more likely to have uneven cooking and lowered food standards in a camping situation and you have a potentially bad illness all prepped and ready to go.

Now put yourself miles from a trailhead with this foodborne illness and in need of medical care.  Not a good situation.

All of this sounds very negative.  But, it doesn't mean you can't haul in frozen burgers successfully and enjoy  them safely.

It means that you need to know the risks and how to mitigate them.

First, your frozen burgers need to stay frozen until cooking time.  You can't really change the initial bacterial load easily, but you can keep it from ruining your food and trip.  Put your burgers into a closed but vented tyvek bubble pack with dry ice.

Second, you need to take your burgers from frozen to done in a short period of time.  Keep the temp in the danger zone for the shortest possible time.  Put a frozen burger into a heated pan and cover it to cook.

Third, kill them bacteria.  Cook your burgers done.  We all like a  rare juicy burger.  Time and a place for everything and this is the time and place for a done burger.

Dress it up some.  Bring condiments in packs and some presliced cheese.

Have fun."
hiking,ffejg95,t3_et4qb1,1579850515.0,"Statistically, you are far more likely to be killed walking down a neighborhood sidewalk than a forest trail.

In both places, the animal to be most wary of is the human.  But knowing the statistics rarely helps people feel safe.

Black bear vs brown bear safety is somewhat different in detail but the most basic premise is identical: Don't give them a reason to bother you.

Wild animals in general want nothing to do with humans.  Almost every black bear encounter I have had involved bears running away as hard and fast as they could.  The bears who weren't running were either habituated bears in parks or bears that I think were too deaf and blind to know I was there.  Even these instances there was no substantial danger.  All I had to do for safety was literally don't poke the bear.

I have had a bear try for my food bag one time out of thousands of hangs, that I know about.  I shined my headlamp, yelled at it, and it ran away.  I got back to sleep after hours of listening to every rustle and creak but it really was inconsequential in hindsight.  Shelter mice have caused me far more damage.  

In almost all situations, avoiding conflict creation comes down to good food safety habits.  I try not to cook and eat where I sleep.  I try to store food safely away from where I sleep.  These 2 things greatly reduce the food odors around camp.

Learn how to do a good food hang.  It rakes practice.  Knowing the idea and being able to execute it are very different things.  95% of food hangs are actually more like dangling bait bags which just speaks to bear reluctance to generally come into occupied campsites.

Practicing good food safety is a help.  So is practice in general.  To become more at ease in the woods, spend more time being in the woods.  This can help a lot as you become more familiar with the circumstances."

Here is my take on hydrophobic down.  There is truth on all sides, and a lot of opinion touted as fact.

Benefits: hydrophobic down doesn't get wet as easily as untreated down.  This includes loft loss from body moisture overnight, which can be substantial if your untreated down was cleaned really thoroughly to reduce the down stink because that also removes natural water resistance from down.  It is idiot resistant.  Wetting out your down bag and dying of hypothermia is less likely.

Drawbacks: it seems like the actual treatment can reduce lofting or even cause clumping if applied poorly.  QA needs to be vigilant for the final product quality. If your down loft is measured pretreatment instead of post-treatment you may not have the expected loft in the finished product.  The more environmentally friendly the hydrophobic treatment, the shorter it seems to persist.  It is not idiot proof and idiots test boundaries they shouldn't.  You cannot go swimming in your hydrophobic down product and have it remain dry. Wetting out your hydrophobic down bag and dying of hypothermia is still achievable.  A well constructed bag probably will never have  issues unless an idiot has done exactly that.

I opt for treated down in products I use.  And then pack them in a dry bag.  

If one of my friends does not use hydrophobic down, I think that is ok."

worldpolitics,ffbsdbx,t1_ffbpxhr,1579780925.0,"$7.50 is absolutely unlivable in the US without taking a lot of austere measures.  


That's $15,600 if you work full time, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year.  After the taxes that even the lowest earners pay, the take home would be about $14,000.

The national average for rent for a 1 bedroom apartment is $1,025/month.  If you had no unplanned expenses, that would leave about $142/month for electric, water, sewer, food, medical, etc.  So pretty tough.  Without itemizing, not possible without 'alternate income'.

Looking at what Bezos pays, say $15/hr.  That gets you $31,200 before tax about 26,700 after federal tax (most people pay state taxes as well).  But we will skip the state tax for now.  And sales tax.  

So if you pay that average 1 bedroom rent of $1025, that leaves you $14,400 unspent income annually.  So let's look at some costs.  Electric average is about $111/month.  You're at $13,068 remaining.  Water averages $70/month.  Leaves $12,228.  Sewer average is about half of water, so $35/month.  Leaves $11,808. Food - around $250/month average.  Leaves $8,808.  Medical insurance.  Average is $440/month.  Leaves $3,528 for the year. Or less than $10/day.  Also, you have not met the deductible on health insurance.  The average deductible is $4,358  for a single person in the US.  Eh, you probably won't need that.  Stay healthy!  Or dental coverage.  Or vision coverage.  Cause neither of those come under medical coverage here.  Good thing you don't have a car.  Cause there is no money left for the car, gas, insurance, etc.  It is just a huge country with almost no public transit over most of it.  Also, you have no phone, no internet service, no entertainment, etc.  You can't even afford to shop at Whole Foods with your employee discount.

Now all of those numbers are averages and the truth is that in the US these things do vary widely regionally.  For example, where my shop is, the sewer hill is 2x what our water bill is, not half.  I have a friend who pays about 8x higher rates than I do for electricity because of a nuclear plant that never went online but had to be paid for anyway.  Rent is hugely expensive in metro areas compared to rural.  Metro areas do tend to have workable mass transit though.  But the bottom line is that what he pays does not allow for a decent living.

Deliberately placing another human being in that position is evil.  Doing wage studies such that you completely understand on an intimate level exactly how hard you are screwing someone who has to live on the wage that you are offering - and then offering that wage that will create and prolong suffering so that you can line your own pockets, not from need, but from greed is unethical and immoral.

The combination of these two technologies has allowed for increasing specialization in the human life.

While I pride myself on being able to build or fix many things, the truth is that even a person like myself who  can grow crops, build a house, cook dinner, wash clothes, make things like soap or cheese, build a website, etc.  - we're just using training, tools and materials made available by others who came first.

Very few people know how to make things that we all take for granted.  Try making some tinfoil.  Or electrical wire.  How about a half gallon freezer bag?  

The reason why most of us don't know how to do these things isn't that we are all useless gits but instead that only a very few specialized people are needed doing these things to supply what everyone needs.  So the knowledge isn't that general."

Good socks.  I prefer Darn Tough.  Just get something made for hiking.  Merino Wool, high stitch count, fits your foot perfectly are key points.

Hydration.  This ranges a lot.  You can get bladders for your pack, water filters, chemicals, etc down to just bringing a bottle of water from the corner store.  A widemouth nalgene 32 oz bottle is a good thing to own.

Snacks.  Clif bars, nuts, cookies, chips, whatever you like.

Lighter.  Small torch style lighter is ideal.

Excel can crunch lots of numbers but it actually renders display in cells as it does so.  Even if the dell is on a tab that you aren't viewing, the work gets done.  And it goes faster if it has more resources to do the rendering. So - video matters. 

This guy had about 60 tabs going at once with macros to generate reports for across our company.  The only thing he did manually every week was drop in the weekly data, then distribute and talk through the reports.

CampingGear,ff14vh4,t3_er3tby,1579475206.0,"So, how much the weight matters depends a lot on you and how you use your gear.

Going to lay out a couple of cases for examples.

Case 1.  You backpack in 3 miles to a campsite.  You set up, relax, fish, watch wildlife, read, generally hang out and enjoy yourself for 3 days.  Then you pack up, head out 3 miles and go home.

Case 2.  You decide to hike, let's say, the Superior Hiking Trail in Minnesota.  You do a traditional hike of 260ish miles.  You set aside 15 days to get it done (2 weeks vacation plus a holiday on one end) and you have zero spare time so you have to get in your miles, deal with missing work, or cut the hike short.  It is constant up and down, regular mud, and you need most of tye daylight each day to get in the miles, much less resupply, wash clothes, etc.

Case 1 - any tent that keeps off rain and is comfy generally works.  The extra money goes for beer and hookers.

Case 2- ounces count and the guy lugging 2 extra pounds of tent is too slow.  He is sexually molested by angry beavers before being tragically drowned later the same day by an angry moose. 

These are obviously facetious, but you get the idea.  Figure out your usage and buy appropriately."
