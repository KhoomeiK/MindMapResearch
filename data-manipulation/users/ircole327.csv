The first Ex wasn’t allowed to see me anymore because of her shitty parents after 4 months of dating. Causing me to have massive abandonment issues and a overall sense of dread I can’t get out of my head. 

The one after that played me for a fool at one of the weakest moments in my life. I liked her a lot but I also wanted to prove to myself that dating for me wasn’t hopeless. And then it turned out to be also a hopeless mess so it just proved to me that dating and me don’t mix. It was my fault for not seeing the red flags but I was in a really bad spot in my life and I saw hope before I saw any issues.

Now whenever I find someone attractive, I feel bad because my brain tells me that it’ll just end terribly like the last ones because that’s literally all I know."

It’s almost like race isn’t really considered when picking these nominees and instead (get this) the actors and actresses performances. 

Sometimes there will be a lot of diversity in a country where the majority is white. sometimes there won’t.

This year the only “snubs” for an acting category were Robert De Niro for The Irishman (an Italian) and Kang Ho Sang for Parasite (a Korean) 

Just like sometimes the best picture nominees are all movies people have heard of like 2020 and 2019 and sometimes it’s a bunch of movies no one has heard of like 2017 and 2018
