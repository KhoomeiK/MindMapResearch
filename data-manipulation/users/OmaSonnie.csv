biology,fecjotj,t1_fechgzb,1578975559.0,"I understand.  What class is the drug TRELLOGY? .  It was recently prescribed for me, a former smoker (quit 3mos. Ago.) because Icouldnt perform the daily exercise I need.  It has made a world of difference!  Today I walked over 1 mile without undue discomfort.  I need to keep this up and add to the routine.  I was unable to do this before the drug.  But the cost is out of range for me, and because I am a Medicare patient, I haven't found a ""coupon"" or help for this financially.  I am furious at the BIG PHARMA Companies for taking advantage of people in my position.  My doctor gave me a 2 -month supply.  This will run out.  THEN WHAT DO I do?  My SS pays me $780/mo.  I cannot afford the several hundred dollars more for this drug.  When I think of all this it makes me cry.  I'm not alone.  I know there are many others in worse situations.  But what can we do?  This whole situation sucks.  I am 78 yrs. old.  I work d and paid taxes since I was 16 yrs old.    SOMEONE, or SOMETHING  has let me down.  
Sorry to vent, but I am grateful for what I DO HAVE."
biology,fecgs8x,t1_fecf5qc,1578973553.0,"But they are prescribed and administered as patients demand!  Or is it only antibacterials
that get this treatment.?    Is it only the ones advertised with the suffexes ""umab""and .""...nab"" that are antivirals?  Seems like most of those have those suffuses.  They all DO seem to have the scariest  after effects attached.  And let's not forget the Nibs and mobs while we are at it.   

Rats,, this old iPad keyboard won.t work properly.  Can anyone understand what I am getting at?"
biology,feceka9,t1_fe8vcxx,1578972045.0,Wow.  This is scary!  We have to stop abusing and overusing the anti-viral and anti - bacterial substances we have developed.  These living organisms are not as weak nor as benign as we treat them.  They have millions of years or nature teaching them how to survive.
