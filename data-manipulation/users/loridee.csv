Whatcouldgowrong,fep3adz,t3_epia6t,1579311171.0,"True story:  in college I took a blind friend bowling after we went drinking, because he said he missed bowling.  He went blind due to Type 1 diabetes when he was a teenager.  He threw the ball and it landed in the lane next to us and a big, angry man came over and threatened to beat our asses and then he stopped and said ""is that a seeing eye dog??  Are you fucking BLIND?!""  We didn't get beat up."
aww,fep2xo8,t3_epnbwl,1579310946.0,She's so tiny.  I have an ex-feral and she is similarly tiny.  The vet said likely due to malnutrition.  She was skin and bones when I found her.  She is fully grown and weighs 5 lbs.  It's like having a permanent kitten around.
cats,fep2i3z,t3_epyxr1,1579310672.0,"I made a huge, humiliating mistake at work yesterday and I've been secretly crying for the last 24 hours off and on.  Prescription:  kitten videos."
aww,fef3a80,t3_eonffw,1579047162.0,"The Joshua tree grows quickly, considering they are in the desert, and they have deep root systems.  They branch after they bloom, with lovely flowers.  May your son be healthy and grow even when life is hard, may he feel deeply rooted with you, and bloom under your care.  Being responsible for a new life is amazing.  You both look more than ready."
aww,fdfedyi,t3_ekxxoo,1578359734.0,"Be careful.  My stepfather used to give squirrels peanuts in the shell, in the same manner.  One bit him, mistaking his thumb for a peanut shell.  Now, he was (and is) a complete asshole.   The poor squirrel probably keeled over."
aww,fdbtfw0,t3_ekdkos,1578261776.0,"My younger son bonded like this with one of our cats and when he went away to college, the cat was completely bereft.  He missed my son so much.  The first time my son came home, he didn't say anything and he sat next to the cat, and when the cat turned to look at him, he let out a big meow and jumped onto his lap.  He was so happy.  That bond lasts forever."

guineapigs,fcmzu3j,t3_ehtk0v,1577799036.0,"I rescued my first piggie, purchased my second piggie so I could make sure he has a friend, and rescued my third one.  I was at Petco and I didn't know this, but if you see animals in enclosures up front near the register, I've only seen guinea pigs so far, they are up for adoption and they are typically $10 ea.  They are piggies who have been returned, or in the case of my Rorschach, an autistic child was unable to keep his piggies because his mother was dying.  I was happy to give a good home to one of his pigs, who blended right in with my other two (males) and is a sweetheart."
AmItheAsshole,fcmznon,t3_ehw713,1577798862.0,"NTA.  This is not healthy.  Mama better get her shit together.  Needing to be reassured about parental attachment is normal for a 3yo, who is realizing he/she is a separate person, and it can be frightening.  

What concerns me is that if your wife is modeling this kind of insecure attachment, is this affecting your daughter?  Make an appointment to see a couples therapist ASAP.  Seriously."
