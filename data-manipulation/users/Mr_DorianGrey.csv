P.S. doesn't me you shouldn't tell them, but be prepared for the worst outcome. You might even make better connections being honest"

depression,fdns1yb,t3_em5e7y,1578591683.0,The thing you need to understand is that your group of friends when you have depression decreases. Nobody likes a downer. This isn't necessarily bad. You can still show face on your good days. Alternatively you can look for people who will understand you and not talk behind your back and enjoy your company for who you are. Either way you'll have better quality friends
depression,fdnrikm,t1_fdmgsbd,1578591400.0,No. But you hang in there alright?
depression,fdmgpud,t1_fdmggm8,1578549316.0,You just made me smile. Thank you. And Good Night
depression,fdmgodj,t1_fdmgimf,1578549277.0,You just gave me an idea and I'm not sure if it'll work or not but I sure as hell will try. You've already done your part. Sleep well tonight. I need to sleep on this too and we'll see.
depression,fdmgc1i,t1_fdmg29i,1578548950.0,"(un)Fortunately not. The time I wanted to end it has long passed. Now I'm used to the pain, it almost soothes me. I'll keep fighting until something else kills me. You know, I'm surprised that all these depressed people and we never meet. Meeting someone like you in real life would light up my day. I just had an idea btw. Thank you so much! You may have just saved the life of so many people!"
depression,fdmg336,t3_em5e7y,1578548719.0,Get some sleep. We'll talk tomorrow
depression,fdmfzji,t3_em5dbg,1578548627.0,Care to explain or just venting?
depression,fdmfxyg,t3_em5bjt,1578548587.0,It's not about other people. You can't disappoint anyone but yourself. Forget about them and live life for you. Or don't. That's up to you. But you can always live to fight another day.
depression,fdmfs1m,t1_fdmfkhm,1578548435.0,"Believe it or not they're not gonna care soon after. Human mind is designed to forget. You have to decide if you wanna take the easy way out or fight back everyday and see if you can beat this thing one day. I'm not saying suicide is easy, but making the decision to do it is. If I had a family who gave a shit, I wouldn't give up just yet. Just my two cents :)"
depression,fdmfm15,t3_em59xq,1578548278.0,"Forget about the first 4 lines you wrote. As a depressed person, you shouldn't worry about others too much. Take care of yourself first and then IF the opportunity comes you may help others only and ONLY if they asked for it. Biggest lesson I learned in life is that never help those who don't seek help. Be strong dear stranger :)"
depression,fdmfgcu,t3_em59bz,1578548131.0,"If you're close with them, ask them exactly this. I'm sure they will help you with that. Maybe not the way you want. But still worth the try"
depression,fdmfb49,t3_em58xp,1578547997.0,"I honestly feel like listening to music all the time (specially with headphones) is really dangerous for depression. At least it's fucking with my mind but maybe that's just me. Either way, booze is not the answer trust me. It sure feels great short term but it'll make you weak and dependant on it. Find something else. For me, it's fresh air. I go out of my apartment for 5 minutes and my head is cleared. Idk what it might be for you but it's not the booze"
depression,fdmf46r,t3_em57tv,1578547823.0,"I wouldn't care about that. Question is, would you miss yourself and what you could have achieved, become? Answer that and you'll have a shred of comfort"
depression,fdmf0lf,t3_em56qq,1578547733.0,I really don't wanna hear this shit. I'm way too far away from all the positive things you got going for you and you're telling me it could still keep crawling back?! FUCK YOU DEPRESSION! I guess you could go out and shout that if you can. I don't think there is anything else you can do. Fresh air on its own usually works for me too. I think humans weren't designed to be trapped in small cubes called apartments
depression,fdmej9x,t3_em52rm,1578547300.0,"It may or may not be the way you look but listen to me. I once started to have these lows and I didn't care about them enough. Fast forward two years and now my lows last a few weeks (almost a month now). I'm totally paralyzed physically and mentally until I feel okay again. Seek help, figure it out on your own. Whatever you do, take care of your health (both mental and physical). I'm not trying to scare you btw. In your case it's probably just you being self conscious about your looks and because of you dying tour hair, that makes you a bit more high maintenance. Which is okay. Just stay on top of it. You're still in charge. Take advantage of that. And good luck"
depression,fdme88j,t3_em51wa,1578547030.0,You're on the right track so don't overthink it. Take your battles as they come. Sometimes you just need to let things happen. Be happy :)
depression,fdksww6,t1_fdkrxpv,1578510477.0,Well I said it in a very general way. You shouldn't become an asshole or be too open that you're always whining to others. I thought that was common sense. If you're smart   you won't lose anyone
depression,fdjj3mt,t1_fdjiyr5,1578473160.0,"Thanks, I'll do my best hiding my depression from those who don't already understand it. Please don't forget to let me know :)"
depression,fdjixst,t1_fdjinv3,1578472940.0,"I've forgotten how to love myself so this might be some empty advice. But I tell you what, every single successful and happy person I know loves themselves above all else. So you and I might not know how, but we sure as hell can try until we do ;)"
depression,fdjitih,t1_fdjiift,1578472780.0,"I'm here for my depression not for money you illiterate asshole. Read again. You seem to have at least half a brain but if you want to use it for sarcasm then nothing's gonna be left to think with. Your brain is much more powerful than you think. If money is what you're after, use your brain a bit more and you'll figure it out. This world is fucked up enough to allow you to do so"
depression,fdjilno,t1_fdji83r,1578472484.0,"I truly hope you get your answer because I desperately seek it too. I hope I meet someone as broken as me. Maybe that'll be my escape. For me, that ""maybe"" is still fine. And by the time I get to your state, I expect you to have the answers for me. So good luck :P"
depression,fdjif0t,t1_fdjhyhu,1578472236.0,"Who says you can only save 700k in 30 years? There are many ways to make cash. Science, business, finance and above all being a smart and manipulative person. If you think money is gonna buy you happiness, then get off your ass and go make some. I'm sure with a bit of Google search you'll find many ways to do so. As I said, it won't be easy. So no it won't happen over a week. Life is never gonna be easy. Even for that lucky person who got 700k for nudes. She might have the worst of her days coming yet. If you want easy, the plastic bag isn't your best bet. Use a more rock solid method. Again, Google is your best bet :)"
depression,fdji7tb,t1_fdjhi1z,1578471970.0,"You should get in shape for your own sake, your own health. As for ""I don't know if I'm good enough for him"", get that out of your head because that's he's job to decide. You should only worry about if he's good enough for you. If the answer is yes, then it's not a problem between you two but a problem between you and yourself. All of us lose ourselves sometimes, it's not about how many times you're beaten up. It's about how many times you get back up, stronger. Love yourself :)"
depression,fdjhyrk,t3_elpxkm,1578471639.0,That's fine. Own it. Be narcissistic. Other people will already think that way about you so don't waste your time feeling that way yourself.
depression,fdjhw5j,t3_elpxm4,1578471546.0,So you're telling me there isn't even a light at the end of the tunnel? You've got it all and the depression doesn't go away? I might as well give up now ...
depression,fdjhrcg,t3_elputv,1578471376.0,"You could ... There are many other things in this world worth more than nudes. Although it won't be as easy as selling nudes. There will be hard work, tears and you might even forget who you are just like I have. But one day you'll get there. Stay strong"
depression,fdg02gw,t3_el6zfd,1578375206.0,"This sounds confusing. If you actually can't feel love, then you wouldn't be thinking about it this much. I understand what you're saying about your mom hugging you btw. Same thing with mine. That's why I don't really hug her anymore. I do however enjoy hugs from my friends And people I care about. Also going into a relationship with this much emotional baggage might be a mistake. Having said that, I'm not trying to turn you away either. I actually think you should start meeting more people that you're attracted to and try to make a connection to start feeling again. Take it slow."
depression,fdfzijp,t3_el67mm,1578374700.0,"This exact same thing happened to me except I didn't fail by choice. Now I see all my friends two years ahead of me and I feel old. But look at it this way, I'm sure those two years haven't been a complete waste. You've seen things, done things and grown more mature. Sure you'll never get them back but what's lost is lost. Take charge of your NOW and your FUTURE. Soon enough you'll forget about the past completely. Good luck :)"
ProgrammerHumor,fdft0ux,t1_fdfstt1,1578369473.0,"It's kinda the same for me. When I'm stuck on a problem or design pattern in a software I'm writing, can't stop thinking about that problem and more often than not I end up dreaming about how to solve it. It's quite wicked"
ProgrammerHumor,fdf30n9,t1_fdem33h,1578352150.0,"This has happened to me more than a few times!

I love it but at the same time I hate it because when I'm having these dreams my sleep quality is non-existent"
