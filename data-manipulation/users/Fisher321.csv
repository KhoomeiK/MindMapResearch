unpopularopinion,ffx6ks4,t3_evl873,1580318822.0,"Also, just because someone didn’t “work” for their wealth doesn’t mean it shouldn’t belong to them. Just because Jim grew up in a mansion doesn’t give anyone the right to take it away from him."
politics,ffx5szn,t3_evlpql,1580318359.0,Why do so many Salon posts make it to this subreddit’s frontpage? It’s about as bias as one can get.
worldpolitics,ffwkxay,t1_ffwj6j7,1580304256.0,Can you link your comment?
worldpolitics,ffwipjk,t1_ffwhrou,1580302337.0,"You know it possible to be informed and also vote for Trump? I despise him as a person but I like his policies more than Hillary’s. Much like I really liked Obama as a person but was not a fan of his policies.

Maybe you should not alienate the other side and try to understand why they vote for their candidate instead of attempting to insult them."
worldpolitics,ffwh1r4,t1_ffwggiz,1580300740.0,Half the country voted for him so I would say at least one person does.
worldpolitics,ffwfo3l,t1_ffwfhsd,1580299277.0,"He won more electoral votes than Hillary because he played the game better. Hillary was the worst choice the DNC could’ve had, she has zero charisma, unlike Obama."
worldpolitics,ffwf4ph,t1_ffwf098,1580298666.0,"Why do you think he won? Maybe we will see if people are tired of it this year, maybe people want more. Michael Moore said the same thing. Not sure why you’re upset?"
worldpolitics,ffwdbg3,t3_evg3z7,1580296427.0,"This is why he won. People act shocked when he talks like this but he’s literally being himself. The only difference between him and other politicians is other politicians only say this stuff in private.

Edit: Downvotes for having an opinion which is not popular on Reddit, despite sparking some good discussion. Woo!"
todayilearned,fft9lyp,t1_ffsi3pi,1580213490.0,A $40 scale can measure body fat percentage within 2%. It’s really not difficult. Someone who weighs 180 at  5’9 with 17% body fat is considered “overweight”.
todayilearned,ffs8hsn,t1_ffrs68i,1580175734.0,Not sure why you’re getting downvoted. I don’t understand why it’s more socially acceptable to shame smokers but not far people. Both are equally deadly.
todayilearned,ffs866h,t1_ffrfl4q,1580175509.0,BMI is a terrible way to measure obesity. Body fat percentage is really what needs to be measured. Pretty much every single muscular person is considered “overweight” based on BMI but they have a body fat percentage from 8-20% which isn’t overweight.

worldnews,ffr5cug,t3_euopzs,1580150804.0,"What if the clergy were just allowed to get married? I feel like that would solve a lot of issues. The Catholic Church started that practice in what, the 1000s?"

InsanePeopleQuora,ffgiq9n,t1_ffgia01,1579907157.0,How?
InsanePeopleQuora,fffp6ml,t1_ff63xbr,1579888784.0,That’s not true. The majority of enlisted service members have a middle class background.
madlads,fffb541,t3_et94dg,1579880074.0,"I used to be a young earth creationist. Then I got to college and learned how to critically think. The problem is at home parents enforce these ideals without question, so I thought no matter what I must be right. Once I actually learned what the scientific method was, and that scientists aren’t out to “get” Christians, I began to realize how wrong I was. 

I’m still a Christian, but I don’t hold on to those beliefs that contradict science anymore."

science,fevfbq4,t1_feukb4y,1579396744.0,Actually there was a study that showed most service members come from middle class families. I’ll try to find it.
ABoringDystopia,fekkii9,t3_epfp1b,1579201952.0,"At least they donated? It’s their money they can do what they want with it. Sorry, I know Reddit doesn’t like rich people but no one has an obligation to donate money to anything."
