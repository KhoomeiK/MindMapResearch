We had a good laugh about that for years. 

Honestly, any non-crunchy food you enjoy can be run through a blender. Add something to moisten it so it's as liquidy as you need it to be, and you can go to town.

To thicken things a bit, run cooked white rice in the blender, too. I still enjoy cream of chicken with rice, 35 years after that accident.
