Dogtraining,feu0c5w,t1_feto3ay,1579381852.0,"Personally, I think you'll have more trouble crate training at this point than you would just correcting the behaviors that make you want to crate train anyways. Consider leashing to you while you're at home and teaching the boundaries then. It gives you an opportunity to correct behaviors as they arise. You also have a new dog, you're going to have to puppy proof your house a bit. Make sure he can't get into the garbage, make sure shoes are in the closet, remotes are up high... Etc. You may sacrafice a glove or sock along the way but these things happen. 

I have found crate training at night to be easier. But it's still best to keep the dog close like in your room or something and just because you have the dog in your room now doesn't mean it will be forever. My babies started in my room and as they grew they moved into their own rooms and the dogs just followed... But if we closed the bedroom doors they would be just fine sleeping in the hall or in the livingroom as well. 

You want to teach and manage behaviors but crate training only manages behavior. If you only teach crate training a dog will not understand the boundaries outside of the crate. Not crate training make cause you to have to work heavily with the dog for a few days or weeks and you might lose a couple belongings in the process, but you will be able to completely trust your dog at the end of it in 99% of cases. It sounds like you are struggling with crate training, so you may be working heavily on that for a few days to weeks and then still not be able to trust your dog in your home at the end of it.

But as far as crate training, a kong stuffed with peanut butter and frozen might help keep your dog occupied for a while in there.

**Edit to add:** I also get your desire to crate train, even if you manage the environment your dog can still find things to chew, just ask my baseboards. But I was there to correct the behavior and it never happened again."
Dogtraining,ferjio0,t3_epwdla,1579354690.0,"So I am very against the grain here as I don't crate train. Why is the dog in the crate when you are home? At night? Why not just confined to your bedroom? Has the dog done anything to indicate that it would destroy your home if left alone? 

When I pick up a new rescue/puppy I keep them leashed to me in the house for the first while until I know what the dog is like. At night the dog sleeps in my room with the door closed. Some dogs don't like crates some love them. I have had a nervous dog in the past that I had a crate for. I always left the door open and she could come and go as she pleased and she felt safe in there. To other dogs it can feel closterphobic."
Dogtraining,ferhrgg,t3_eq8j5s,1579354039.0,"I can't help just commiserate. My dogs hate issues with German shepherds... 

One of my dogs is generally reactive and I am working with her on that. When we are walking I cross the street away from on coming dogs and make her sit and shove her face full of treats. Her tolerance for other dogs has grown greatly, but not with German Shepherds. There is one in our neighborhood and the owner and I have an understanding, he knows I am trying, he also knows my dog is an asshole, so we wave and he gives me as wide a berth as possible. But even my elderly dog, who doesn't react to anything, HATES this shepherd. 

**A note on the method of making my dog stop the walk to sit when we are approaching her trigger: she is 150lbs. It is much easier for me to control her in case she decides to lose it if I have her seated first."
Dogtraining,ferfn8f,t3_eqcfv7,1579353338.0,"I can't help you with the random attack other than what the other user said about rewarding Ranger when Toast is around and not letting Ranger on the sofa. I also would not trust them alone together anymore obviously. 

I wanted to let you know to make sure you have an extra push on dog socialization now with Toast. He's at a really crucial point and an incident like this can cause future fear/aggression issues. Make sure you get him out and having positive experiences with dogs outside of the home."
Dogtraining,fepl26p,t1_fephbpr,1579323306.0,"I completely agree with how having a reactive dog increases anxiety in public. At home, my girl is a total ""emotional support animal"". She sleeps in my child's room to keep nightmares at bay, she will literally interject to diffuse a conflict, and come comfort when I am sad, but in public she is a menace who thinks that ever other dog is out to kill us. She's 150lbs and walking her is a challenge yet somehow I still do a better job than the woman in the video.

**Edit:** in case it wasn't clear, I am referring to my family pet and not a properly trained and tested support or service animal."
dogs,feof91m,t1_feo9dv2,1579299340.0,"No, it is refered to as a ""service animal"" several times throughout the article.

**Edited to add** ESA are only recognized by the USA. This was a dog traveling from the UK to Canada."
dogs,feoe2t0,t1_feo7404,1579298850.0,Agreed. That is terrible behavior even for a family pet.
Dogtraining,feo53gg,t1_fens31y,1579295241.0,"For a service dog, the over-excitement, jumping up on the furniture unprompted, jumping on the person and licking her face unprompted, then nibbling on her face... the walk at the end is just the icing on the cake.   


Putting a vest on that untrained puppy and calling it a service dog is like me calling my four-year-old with his fisher-price medical kit an MD."
Dogtraining,fenuoyx,t1_fent7sj,1579291088.0,There is no way the dog is a service dog. It's only 8 months old!
dogs,fenph7q,t1_fenmnrw,1579288921.0,The dog is only eight months old. It hasn't even had an opportunity to be a service dog.
dogs,fengoav,t3_eq28nv,1579284291.0,"Okay I am wildly speculating here but I have a theory. I think perhaps there were issues traveling with the dog considering it would only have its priming dose of the rabies vaccine and the UK heavily controls for rabies. This person just HAD to travel with said dog and so as the dog would still be under the 1 yr mark during travel they instead decided that calling it a service dog would give them the special allowances to travel and not risk quarantine.  


Maybe I am attributing malice where incompetence is to blame, but my goodness this really bothers me."
aww,feiqqir,t1_feiolhw,1579144839.0,They look like bull-mastiffs.
Dogtraining,feimc6b,t3_epa9ps,1579141886.0,"The dog probably just got loose and took itself on a walk. Someone was probably looking for it. It happens if gates aren't latched properly or a grip isn't tight enough. 

If the dog was just casually running with you and not over taking you or nipping at you it was probably just being friendly and curious. 

A rule of thumb though is not to run if a dog is chasing you. Especially a German Shepard as you have pictured there. If they are aggressive, they can run faster and running away means your back is turned and you are at a disadvantageg."
Dogtraining,feilr6l,t1_fei4ufw,1579141496.0,"Eh... I have a well treated dog. She is not friendly to strangers. Though she probably would be ""aggressively chasing"". 

PSA: don't choose the calmest (shyest/most fearful) dog of the litter."
Mastiff,fbfeyzw,t3_ed0y1i,1576808949.0,"Hey, it's amazing what you did for Samantha. Can you tell me a bit about Samantha's personality? Is she trained? Good with kids/dogs/people?"
