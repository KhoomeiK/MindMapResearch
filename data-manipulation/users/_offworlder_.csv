But damn if you're own parents can't find it in their hearts to do anything but target and criticize you. Sounds like you've been trying and doing very well. And it's a shame he doesn't believe in you. 

I like your uni plan. You've got this. Get ready to go out and live your life and seize your freedom."

depression,fe0y6ah,t3_enl56g,1578820183.0,Sounds very shitty. What's going on?
depression,fdsuof2,t3_en0ryt,1578708171.0,"Don't lose sleep over it. Just respect what you think is dumb or offensive. If you think it is, then don't do it. If you think what you're posting is something that helps express yourself online in ways that satisfy you and hopefully will be enjoyed by others, then stand by it. Forget the haters. Block, downvote, report, whatever. Or just ignore."
depression,fdq00j2,t3_emo7hq,1578648108.0,"Hopefully you can find someone else for therapy, because it doesn't sound like they have the heart or the professionalism to be a good therapist. But do ask her for a response/explanation about it when you get the chance. Tell her how you felt about it."
depression,fdna03h,t3_ema7up,1578581194.0,"It's dark, I have been thinking this too lately. Guess we got to remember that life isn't about a pass or failure. According to who? We just got to make the most of it. I know it's tough feeling like you won't get where you want to go in life. But we are bound to fail in something, some of the time. We just try to learn from our mistakes and to try again. Hope things settle over for you, take care of yourself"
