It's the same argument used in the CA assault rifle case currently working its way up to the Supreme Court. With a law change in 2017, hundreds of thousands of gun owners became felons if they didn't reconfigure their rifles. If they weren't paying attention, and the rifle is still sitting in their safe untouched/unmodified they are felons in possession of the state's definition of ""assault rifle""."
