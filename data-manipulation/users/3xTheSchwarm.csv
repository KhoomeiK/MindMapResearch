todayilearned,ffijyum,t1_ffifyxo,1579975675.0,"I pay $99 a year for NFL Pass. You cant watch the game live, but you can see all games either normal feed (minus commercials) or condensed, which is every play without time outs, commercials, or stoppage. I live out of market for my team so I just avoid the score and then that evening 1pm games are posted around 7pm. My whole family gathers and bam the game is over in 35-45 minutes. If there is a confusing call you can toggle it to non-condensed replay. Ive got small kids and am a recovering alcohlic so I cant go sit at some bar all Sunday afternoon. And if I did do that $16 times Id certainly spend a lot more than $99."
