But political figures are using the fact the media has errors to basically dismiss all of it, whether it's fake news, lugenpresse, or whatever, and the political figures dismissing the veracity of the news media as a whole, whether in China, India, or the US, seems to be accelerating the distrust towards media as a whole.
