Experiments were very accurately predicted by the Standard Model.  The LHC cost $4.75 Billion.  8 experiments have run but each experiment involves thousands of scientists  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Large_Hadron_Collider_experiments  and generates 100 Petabytes of data.

Read the article!  It was the Standard Model that made the predictions, not String Theory.   

>How do you think they knew what to look for in the first place?

The Standard Model predicted it, not String Theory.   String Theory's predictions were wrong.  String Theory is the modern Ptolemaic Geocentrism.  

Thousands of years Ptolemy was a mathematical revolution.  It predicted the motions of the planets with simple elegance.  Everything was a circle and moved around the Earth.  Then careful observation of retrograde proved the model wrong.   But the response from Ptolemy mathematicians was to add epicycles (dimensions) each time observation didn't match the math.  Eventually, despite the mathematical elegance of simple circles, the system had to be abandoned.

This is the state of String Theory.  The initial work was mathematically brilliant and elegant.  But as new observations were made, String Theory mathematicians had to add extra variables (called dimensions) to account for everywhere their theory didn't match.   Higgs was a watershed moment for String Theory.  String Theory made predictions about the Higgs Boson that conflicted with the Standard Model.   But String Theory was wrong again.

Epicycles.

I personally was really, really hoping for String Theory to predict Higgs.   I had been following String since the early 1990's.  Physics would have been blown open and become even more interesting if String's Higgs predictions were experimentally verified.   It's still possible that String Theory could become the best model so research should continue.   But it is completely wrong to say ""science knows we have 10 dimensions"" when the opposite (String Theory is currently known as wrong.) is known so far."
