Libertarian,fftobyc,t1_ffsufkq,1580225537.0,It's unfortunate that most native borns don't understand what immigration is like. A lot of Americans don't even know what a citizen is.

Libertarian,fepjm3g,t1_feofayg,1579322190.0,Unfortunately I read through the article and all of the replies. I still cannot make any conclusions. It's become all muddied by everyone.
beatsaber,femwe5x,t1_femt8rf,1579271359.0,"Well I've tried about 100 custom songs--mostly from the most popular list. Sure, that's a small amount overall, but there are so many no one can try them all.. 

I am not quite sure how to search for 'notes are not repetitive'. I found most of the custom songs repeat motions frequently. It's hard to describe... but the motions just are not very interesting I suppose. It's probably easiest with examples. Contrast [Burning Sands](https://youtu.be/w8ATgYtqm4c?t=55) with [Shut up and dance](https://youtu.be/x9hJbTlPQUY?t=53) (the most popular song available on expert+). I feel like the latter has a constant stream of blocks that one just sort of hits--nothing wrong with that but it's just boring.

And that is an above-average example. Many of the popular songs I could play with my eyes closed.

Dunno... maybe I am just a minority. Not looking for difficulty per se--more like interesting patterns."

programming,felzo8g,t1_fel6jie,1579235145.0,"The author's point is definitely rude, and probably not politically-correct.

I hope you don't mind me saying though: that the best people are seldom only putting 40 hours/week into their talent. It's just sort of a reality that to be the best-of-best, one has to sacrifice other, regular obligations. There are plenty of software jobs that don't have crunch and don't require lots of time outside of work.

I dunno, I kind of just feel both sentiments. If Microsoft makes it clear that to work on the kernel is not a 40-hour-per-week job, but something more akin to grad school, then I don't have an issue."
curiousvideos,feentxk,t3_eomzxl,1579037522.0,"If Sanders point is that there are other economic markers than just unemployment, then everyone agrees. I don't think that anyone thought unemployment was the sole number by which we measured the economy.

But I think this is going to be interpreted by his supporters in an entirely different way. They will use it to dismiss the overwhelingly positive economic indicators right now to gain political points.

And if it makes you partisans feel better--this is not the first time this tactic has been used. I am just barely old enough to remember hearing about the 'Clinton economy' of the late 90s--which was the biggest economic boom in the history of the US."
curiousvideos,feemx3f,t1_feel9yo,1579036999.0,"It's not evil, just bad policy that ignores real human behavior.

Sanders is clearly very passionate about his causes and I don't doubt that his heart is in the right place, but when you want to do things like tax stock trades or give everyone a debt jubilee, it starts to sound like lofty goals without any deep thought about the implications."

programming,fe93qk6,t1_fe7msaw,1578933832.0,A lot of scientific calculations are done in python... Regular old python. For a while it was sort of a successor to Fortran for scientists and engineers who only dabble in programming.
programming,fe5oiqt,t1_fe5i4eu,1578872202.0,"Don't you think it's reasonable that an article about say McDonald's might involve some discussion of the fast food burger joint industry as a whole? Don't you think a comparison between McDonald's and it's competitors is related to a discussion of McDonald's?

It seems reasonable to me. If we applied that rule, there would be almost no discussion at all.

The way I read it is that 'despite these advanced techniques, there are still a lot of cheaters in games'. Yes it might not be the same exact system, but it likely does the same sorts of checks.

Libertarian,fdbzb62,t1_fdbftm9,1578264198.0,"So this is digging deep into nuclear deterrence theory.

What you described is current usa policy, as far as I am aware. But someone still has to decide to push the proverbial button. And if you only have 5 or 10 minutes, that likely isn't enough to rouse Congress.

Sure maybe we can have Congress pass some laws dictating when the president can do it, but then we are still relying on the president's judgement at the moment."

Libertarian,fcydtzt,t1_fcyacjp,1578078584.0,"I hate to turn this into a debate, but I was actually in the opposite position. I like Biden just because he is normal and sane. And right now that's all I am really looking for.

I have very serious concerns about Sanders. I think he is very passionate and well-meaning--and popular because his positions are rock-solid for 4+ decades--but I think his policies have a real chance to hamstring the economy."
Libertarian,fcyd8i0,t1_fcxxl64,1578078390.0,"Libertarian parties stand no chance. No one can quite agree on what libertarianism is, and when one is allready eccentric enough to vote 3rd party, it's easy to lose votes over single issues.

Republicans and Democrats don't have these issues to the same degree. First: they don't have as much of a philosophical differences, and second: they shy away from controversial issues. They are voting more for personality and gut then issues.

I actually respect Johnson more for being open to UBI. It's not that I support UBI (I was actually talking to my brother this morning about why I think UBI can be a bad idea) but I like that he is thoughtful enough to consider it. Who knows, maybe I am wrong?"

AskReddit,fcwqzos,t1_fcwdgo2,1578034167.0,"So basically by 3, our eyeballs are adult size and don't grow. So it sounds like it's true then.

cscareerquestions,fcwptwj,t3_ej8n4i,1578032973.0,"Would you mind disclosing what range of debts you were in? 

I ask this because I actually have the opposite experience: I cared too much about tuition and I regret not going to university. At the time, I calculated I would be about $40,000 in debt--which seemed unimagine able at the time. But as it is now, I could have easily paid that off.

cscareerquestions,fcwpd1d,t3_ej5lqb,1578032508.0,"There are some companies that would do this. But be warned... and I try to say this as nicely as possible... you're probably not in the pool of candidates who can demand that \*upfront\* yet.

There are however, many companies that would be much more lenient to established employees. I work at Big Bank, and there are plenty of people with flexible work arrangements--mostly either because of child care or they are part-time students, ie for a reason, although I do think there are some people who work 4 10s just because.

If this is \*really\* something you want, my advice to is work for a few years at a cushy place and then ask. People are much more lenient once you are trusted/established.
