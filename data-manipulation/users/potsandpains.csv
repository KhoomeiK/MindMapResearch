college,ff49kfc,t1_ff497ux,1579558516.0,Yeah best bet is to directly contact them and they should walk you through the process
sex,ff49ed2,t3_erk98u,1579558409.0,I bought a safe for like $25 and hide it in my dresser drawer way in the back
college,ff48y21,t3_erkap8,1579558128.0,"Is there an option to admit as a visiting student? That’s what I did when I took a calc class at a community college and then transferred the credit over to my main college.
And make sure you check the credit transfer equivalences from your main university, you don’t want to take a class at this community college if it won’t transfer over"
dating,fee5xm2,t1_fedoo21,1579027069.0,"If he has no time for you at all, not even one day, then he’s not interested"
college,fedo0tv,t1_fedndze,1579016138.0,"Yeah it’s true, some are harder to gauge then others. Just start the studying a few days in advance and it’ll help you figure out where you stand

Nah babe I’m a robot, beep boop."
college,fedn00w,t3_eomjwv,1579015480.0,"I’ll usually start studying five/four days before a test. How long depends on the class and my confidence levels. If I’m feeling confident I’ll study like an hour a day until the test, no confidence like four + hours a day until the test lmao. I’d say my efficiency has gotten a lot better, I have a system for studying each subject. I am not human"
dating,fedlrp2,t1_fedlfqj,1579014659.0,"You need to make concrete plans soon. If that doesn’t happen then I think it’s a lost cause. My brother is a wrestler, works part-time, and still goes on dates with girls. He’s actually the same age as the boy you’re talking about lol"
dating,fedl5v6,t1_fedksze,1579014248.0,Have you guys seen each other at all since November
dating,fedjtzn,t1_fedjb3l,1579013335.0,"It’s possible that’s the reason, for sure. 

To me, based on you saying he wants to hang out alone, you guys don’t text that often, and he brushed off the date idea I think he might just want to mess around or keep it low key. He likes you, since he’s still talking to you but how much I don’t know. I could be wrong

In my experience if a guy wants to be with you and date you he will do his best to make it happen."
dating,fedizq2,t3_eolrgx,1579012744.0,Sounds like he likes you. He probably doesn’t want a girlfriend tho
college,fediwls,t3_eolyw6,1579012681.0,"Yep, took a semester off last semester. Starting at a new college closer to home in a week. Just go for it, it’s a short amount of time and it gives you a break and time to figure out what you want to do. I think the break was beneficial to me

I Wanted to add that if taking off entirely seems too daunting you could take one or two online gen ed courses or something"
AmItheAsshole,fedinro,t3_eoltmi,1579012507.0,NTA- you’re not obligated to get him them.
