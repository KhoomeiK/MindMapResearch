namenerds,fd552fm,t1_fd1vp3l,1578174226.0,"Christians and Muslims are exactly the ones who have been perpetrating anti-Semitism for the last 1000+ years. Christian culture even among people who consider themselves agnostic/atheist/secular/non-religious continues to perpetuate anti-Semitism. A name is not a Christian name just because it technically appears in the old testament if it hasn't been used widely and has a strong cultural association with Judaism.

It's not about theory, it's about norms. *Could* Ezra be a Christian name? Sure. *Is* Ezra a Christian name? No.

But, of course, because it's based around norms, it's highly variable. In a community that's just culturally Christian and culturally Jewish, the name Baruch is a Jewish name. But Baruch (and it's other forms) are pretty normal among Muslims, so if we're in a culturally Muslim and culturally Jewish, or culturally Muslim and culturally Jewish and culturally Christian community, Baruch is no longer a Jewish name. But just because it's a Jewish name and a Muslim name does not make it a Christian name, even though Baruch appears in the Old Testament.

Except for fringe Protestant communities that *do* use Old Testament names that, in more mainstream Christian culture, would read Jewish or Muslim. But the context of a couple of Amish folks named Nehemiah and Bathsheba naming their son Baruch and suburban Christmas Catholics John and Anna naming their son Baruch is very different.

And that touches on an issue that is there's not even a single unified Christian naming culture. Joachim reads pretty Jewish in a largely Protestant culture, but pretty neutral in a place that's largely Catholic.

 There are very few names that you can say are purely Jewish names. Hebrew and even Yiddish and Ladino names have use outside of Jewish communities.

But that's why you have to be honest with yourself. *Is* Ezra a normalized name in your given Christian or Muslim culture? Or is it a Jewish name, but you want to use it anyway so you're pointing out that *technically* the figure of Ezra also appears in the Bible? 

I can't tell you that no Christian or Muslim child should ever be named Ezra. All I can say is that if you have to dig deep into texts and pick out specific historical figures and create elaborate arguments about why technically you should have cultural claim to use a certain name without other people giving you the side eye for it, and meanwhile real people who belong to the culture that the name is normatively associated with have suffered and are suffering and are marked by their names and have had to hide their names, but you can feel confident that your child can bear the name safely and will never have to suffer like that because they are ultimately a part of the majority that is perpetrating that suffering...

namenerds,fd091fz,t3_ejqq0t,1578115439.0,"It's just that it's a pretty identifiably Jewish name. While it does appear in the Bible and it does have some history of use among English Protestants (for example, Ezra Pound), it's not something like Nathan or Matthew where it's widely used outside of Jewish communities.

So it's a name that is largely associated with Jewish people and Jewish communities, and in some ways marks people as Jewish. Historically using a name like Ezra that was so obviously Hebrew would make Jewish people targets of violence and discrimination, so we would have both a Hebrew name and a secular name (this practice still exists, though its more common now for people to just use their Hebrew names.) 

So the argument is basically that historically (and to an extent still today), Jewish people have been victims of violence and discrimination for having obviously Hebrew (or otherwise Jewish, like Yiddish or Ladino names) names. And therefore it's inappropriate for gentiles, who have had *centuries* to safely use Ezra if they want it, have waited to do so until now, when Hebrew names are not such a mark. People didn't want to name their kids Ezra back when anti-Semitism was much more overt, but now Hebrew names are trendy and cool. Moreover, many people are misusing Hebrew names (like using Ezra and Elijah and such for girls), or are using Hebrew names while being very anti-Semitic themselves.

Jewish people have, historically, been victims of violence and discrimination for having a name like Ezra. Jewish people are *still*, *to this day*, targeted for using Hebrew names. Gentiles named Ezra get the trendy fun of having such a fresh, zippy name, while getting to bypass the anti-Semitism that Jewish boys named Ezra have had to, and continue to have to deal with."

Theyre the sort of thing a lot of people are very opinionated about in theory, but they second they actually meet a boy (especially a family member) with a double name it all smooths out. 

For example in the south I know a lot of John Michaels, John Davids (as well as a John Davis), and John Pauls. I know a Marcantony, a Wyatt Parker, a Will Ross, a Luke Ryan, a John Francis, and a John Laurence, just off the top of my head. Basically any name works just fine when tacked onto John, and plenty of other names work as well. And despite them being so obviously popular/common-place around here, people are still skeptical/critical of them in theory. But everyone still calls them by both names, it's never difficult or confusing, I think a lot of people say ""oh I don't like double names on boys"" without even realizing they probably know a boy with a double name and have never taken issue with it."

It's not an eating disorder to exercise to burn off extra food. It's not an eating disorder to eat less after overeating. It's not an eating disorder to restrict your food intake, or to count calories, or to avoid certain foods, or to skip meals, or even to fast. It's also not an eating disorder to eat a lot at once, or to eat more than other people, or to overeat. 

The disorder comes from the attitudes, the beliefs, the rationales, the intentions, the emotional response. The disorder comes from the obsession, and the anxiety, and the guilt and shame, from the unhealthy desires, from the lack of control, from the warped sense of reality, from the self-loathing and the dissociation. 

I don't have an eating disorder because I run to burn additional calories after I eat. I have an eating disorder because I'm terrified of not running, because I believe if I don't run I will gain massive amounts of weight even if I have undereaten, because I will run and run and run even if I am fatigued or light-headed or injured or conditions are dangerous, because I will run to dehydrate myself and refuse to drink water. 

Eating disorders are not *actions* and I am so tired of hearing (even in this community!) them reduced to that. Someone doesn't have an ED just because they fast. Fasting is not disordered. And people can have an ED even if they are not performing associated behaviors."

fatlogic,fbzrdpw,t3_ef2hkk,1577257635.0,"Ate food all day today, was very full by late night. My sister is trying to get me to stay up and eat and drink with her more, and I said I'd stay up and hang out but I don't want to eat or drink more cause I'm so full. She asked me if it was because of my weight loss and I said, yeah, sort of, like I know I have a tendency to binge eat so I've been trying to get out of the habit of eating every moment from when I wake up to when I go to bed. Instead I just eat til I'm physically full and then try to stop and not eat anymore until I'm physically hungry again, which sometimes means eating throughout the day but in practice has meant a lot of eating my full day's worth of food grazing throughout the morning and early afternoon and then not really eating after about two. It's not intentional, structured IF, it's just ""if I eat 3,000 calories [high tdee from exercise] I'm really not hungry  even hours later."" 

My sister goes off in faux-concern about how unhealthy that is, how ""that's intermittent fasting and that's so dangerous to do for more than a week"", warning me to ""not let it get out of hand.""

For one, as if I'm not the one who lost 70lb and has maintained a healthy weight range for going on three years now despite being overweight/obese since childhood, whereas she has gained as much weight in just the last couple years and is now very obese despite being a healthy weight the rest of her life.

For another, I do struggle with disordered eating. But my ""eat til I'm full and then stop eating"" is my *good* food behavior. The way she's trying to guilt me into eating, where I just eat and eat constantly as entertainment and a social crutch even when I'm so physically full I'm in genuine pain, is *exactly* what drove me to develop purging habits in the first place. ""Don't let this get out of hand"" my trying to respond normally to hunger cues is not what gets out of hand, my binging and then various compensatory behaviors and patterns are.

It's just so fucking infuriating to hear someone basically call my attempt at recovery behavior dangerous and then encourage me into the disordered behaviors she knows I struggle with and frame it as being concerned for my health and safety. Eating disorders are not cured by forcing people to constantly eat! I will never get away from purging if I can't get away from binging. But my sister very much embraces and encourages emotional eating, social eating, and even real, true, out of control, hide-the-evidence binging."

But I was scared for a little bit that I was gonna get kicked off the sub in their ED purge"
