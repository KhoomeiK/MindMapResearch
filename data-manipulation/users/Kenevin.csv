cats,fenwn5w,t1_femgeyq,1579291973.0,"The hair helps a lot. Sit with your back to a fireplace with no shirt at a distance at which after a little while it becomes uncomfortable. But on a cotton undershirt. That's better. You can sit there for a while longer. But on an other t shirt on top, through the two layers, you can probably sit in this spot as long as you want now.

Your back will be hot, but not uncomfortable. You may find it nice to be super warm on one part of your body only. Cats are like that too, they're covered in fur, so the heat doesnt go directly into their skin where the pain receptors are, it all gets absorbed into their fur and heats them up comfortable."

Habs,feaxszc,t1_feaemcx,1578953321.0,"Can I make the argument (entirely out of my ass) that the team may reduce his ice time in order to make him less appealing for an NHL team to bring him over early, for the very argument that was made above. 

Again, out of my ass entirely, but,  would it be that out of character to imagine a pro team in Russia engaging in a bit of a shakedown? 

Not saying that's necessarily what is happening here, I dont watch him play, but it makes sense to me, generally speaking."
MurderedByWords,feaw5zu,t1_feapvhw,1578952798.0,"Absolutely, they rallied like only Republicans do. Its fascinating (scary)"
MurderedByWords,feafeg2,t1_feae7q9,1578948030.0,"I hold no political allegiance, I'm not American either. This short preface is to make sure I dont appear to be defending the Republican party. I'm not. 

But, it seems to me that the Republican party leadership never expected him to win the nomination nor the general election. They appeared to collectively extend their support to him after he won the nomination. 

Perhaps I'm reading you wrong, but I think its giving them too much credit to say they(Republican leadership) floated him intentionally from the get-go. 

I think we agree I that his election was absolutely a result of the massive smear campaigns and sheer hatred towards the Obama Administration. 

Does anyone remember Overpasses for Obama's Impeachment?"
MurderedByWords,fe9tdqs,t1_fe8u8r2,1578941323.0,"The GOP was plotting when Obama got his first term.

Habs,fe57wuq,t1_fe3yprp,1578866396.0,"Kovalchuk came in at a crawl, like he was waiting for options, super patient and with Danault 5M dollar-manning it down the ice on the right, the defenceman had to fight his instincts to play the passer, and he just got caught in no mans land with a useless stick."
Habs,fe56cxk,t1_fe0gya8,1578866036.0,"Say he scores 12-15 before the end of the season, plays hard and shows passion. Ik that's a generous number of goals, imagine it's a best case for him. 

If the Habs offer him a 3-3.5M 2 year contract, would you hate it? If hes expecting 4M+, I dont think many GM would give it to him at 37. Theres gotta be one though..."

You're taking my initial post really personally and you came at me with vitriol and a false premise, I think you should re evaluate how you engaged me and reflect on that, it may help you understand why your approach was not fruitful in this particular instance."

They'll break down every exercise and equipment that can be used to work a specific muscle group. There will be GIFs to show you proper form and a bunch of smarty pants talk how the exercise works.

Maybe exercise A or B is more efficient but if you enjoy doing C the most and it feels most comfortable, do that. 

Online workouts are almost all about optimizing your time and effort. You will get there in your own time. No need to go beat yourself up in the Gym doing things you're not comfortable with because SwoleDaddy63 told you to do it on t-nation"
