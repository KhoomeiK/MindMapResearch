WatchPeopleDieInside,ffw45ne,t1_ffpyx80,1580283527.0,"Looks like a situation where the servers are responsible for running the dishes back out into the restaurant/kitchen and they neglected to take the cart before it was too full. So the dishwasher kept piling on the plates, because why should he stop doing his job.

Also there could be a drain cover right under that wheel. That slight imbalance will cause an overloaded cart to tip.

This happened once a week at an old job. The dishwasher was a bit spiteful so he made sure to keep piling that shit on so he could watch the lazy servers struggle."

Most people don't even bat and fucking eyelash, for example, when 600,000+ civilians are killed in Iraq and the Middle East as a result of the war. Y'all got some fucked up priorities. I do feel bad for his daughter though. I will say that the rape shit is not a factor in my opinion. I just don't care about Kobe or his career and believe he is no better than anyone else."
