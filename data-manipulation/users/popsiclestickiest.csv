PoliticalHumor,ff9vtok,t1_ff9ew4c,1579722612.0,"There was plenty of evidence. It wasn't their jurisdiction but the Congress's to impeach the president before he could be charged with crimes as per the OLC policy which is stated as:

>The indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would unconstitutionally undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions.

In that context, Mueller's statement is clear that he did not exonerate the president when he testified with carefully chosen words:

>Based on Justice Department policy and principles of fairness, we decided we would not make a determination as to whether the president committed a crime.

Not based on law, based on policy. Policy saying you can't indict a sitting president because he can't be charged... but here are some more of Mueller's words:

>   First, the opinion explicitly permits the investigation of a sitting president because it is important to preserve evidence while memories are fresh and documents are available. Among other things, that evidence could be used if there were co-conspirators who could now be charged.
And second, the opinion says that the constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.
And beyond department policy, we were guided by principles of fairness. It would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of an actual charge.

-
So he felt he couldn't charge or even officially accuse the president of a crime because he couldn't be indicted or prosecuted-- that ""process other than the criminal justice system"" is impeachment. And when asked if the president could be charged with crimes once he leaves office the answer was a swift, unequivocal yes. Under oath.
