bipolar,ff9jsb5,t3_es7hxh,1579714503.0,"Strongly disagree.

This is a place to not be judged, moderated, limited. I am limited in the real world always and this is a space I do not have to hold back and everyone in this sub needs the same chance to express themselves and not be policed for it."

bipolar,ff951b3,t3_es9j8i,1579705006.0,"I have a giant beard always as a deterrent for interactions, if someone is able to look past how aggressive I present myself then I will interact with them, but sometimes when I'm feeling good about myself it does push people away so I may miss out on meeting people, example in the grocery store if I go down an aisle people instantly move to the side and look down and away from me, when I'm feeling down I don't mind, but when I'm feeling good it intimidates people and then I feel bad, in summation there is no winning."

bipolar,ff60s3a,t3_eruqjz,1579616185.0,"I have many times been told I need to be more empathetic towards other people, well I am at capacity for feelings, I FEEL so much already let alone trying to feel for others pain when I'm in a pit of despair, it is extremely hard to maintain friendships and for me I rarely form new friendships in the last 10 years. So I understand completely where your coming from."
bipolar,ff60046,t3_erj3a7,1579615577.0,"I just want to punish myself for being alive, my existence is generally miserable so I turn that anger into drive and put my head down and just work and work and work. My mind is broken, my body is broken, but this tank isn't slowing. I push to show what I can do with a shattered mind while others with better health, better opportunities, faulter and it pushes me even harder. 
I used to shy away from any new experiences, but now I understand my mind is ever evolving and I need to challenge it and explore its capabilities. I stopped living closed minded and I try as much as I can now. Next big venture is to start traveling which has terrified me even at the thought, but if I can jeep going I can try that. 
Live for the small wins and just try to remember the cycles come and go, the lows are low....the highs are HIGH, but your a unique person and being unique each individual needs to find what eases their mind and pushes them. There is a big world out there and I'm not letting this hold me down any longer."

Your friend is just a jerk.
Do the same league and don't let him in, he feels entitled to deem who gets what when, cool bro enjoy your temporay trivial power. Seems like it's worth burning bridges for! Blasting him online is pointless someone like this has no moral compass so he is right it means nothing to him. There's plenty of great people to interact with out there that won't cause unneeded problems."

bipolar,fdo3lp9,t3_em5aoc,1578598267.0,"Treated like we are lesser than because of a mental illness. 
This drives me to be successful and look around me and see healthy people saying life is so hard, meanwhile I'm in a spiraling vortex, but have my life more together. One day I hope to be able to meet other bipolar people and not feel shunned and oh man maybe one day be understood, what a feeling that would be! 
Portray us as the media wants, I've never followed the norms and I'm sure everyone is right there with me."
bipolar,fdo2csn,t3_em2z64,1578597610.0,"I'm exactly in that same pit. Increasing lamictal for the past 7 weeks going up to 200mg to try and curb my impulsivity. I feel despair all the time, feel like theres no point to getting up and trying hard in life anymore. Thoughts of suicide are way more frequent and I'm just exhausted from the endless cycle of highs and lows. I've been disconnecting from everyone and everything, hate people seeing me like this. I think its majorly the winter affecting me, I was doing great until the time change and since then I haven't been able to get it together again. I feel your pain deeply. I started writing in a journal and just putting my feelings out on paper have helped alleviate the horrible thoughts. Get back into drawing, that's something I want to learn, but never have. You'll be fine, I'll be fine, we all will. The lows are horrible but being bipolar isn't going to ruin my life, just gotta soldier on through the shit times."
bipolar,fdnx65g,t3_em7qwf,1578594654.0,"I think about this myself lately a lot. I fear that it would be passed down, but as much as I struggle being bipolar I still am a unique and strong person and my genetic line shouldn't end because of a mental illness. Bipolar is a part of me but it doesn't define and control me and make decisions for me."
AmItheAsshole,fdnwezi,t3_elxvfn,1578594219.0,"Hell no your NTA you outplayed a lesser human that had nothing but aggression towards you and being close to him, you wouldn't want a controlling manipulative person being with someone you cared about. 

Well played."

bipolar,fcv2848,t1_fcuri50,1577993125.0,"""Happy"" is relative. We were taught one way to live and perceive and understand things, but learning how to live being bi polar you can just throw out any traditional standards and learn to work around what happy is to you, not anyone else. This ongoing battle is just so exhausting I'm right there with you and struggle to keep going myself. I just try to challenge myself and succeed the best I can and not let being bi polar control my life. You have to dig deep and define your reality and know you can absolutely do it."
