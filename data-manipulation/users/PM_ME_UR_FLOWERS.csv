Yes, I've had mobility training using a guide stick and that's what those are for. Not everyone has them, but as a legally blind person, you can walk into the store with a copy of the ADA and suggest they install them and they probably will. 

They do work well. A fully blind person, which I am not, has to concentrate to navigate stores and parking lots safely. Those bumps are a valuable point of reference. For me, they're more of a reminder that the sidewalk is starting, so watch out for cracks, curbs, and concrete chock blocks.

And for those of you complaining, SHAME ON YOU! Put your eggs on top of your bread, your vegetables on top of your bag of potato chips, stop shuffling your feet, get in your car, and before you turn on the key and drive away, think about the kind of person you are who complains about an accommodation for the blind which inconveniences you on a miniscule scale for a second."
