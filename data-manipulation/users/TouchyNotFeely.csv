I sat by the open door, tempting them with babyfood, then when they got  close, grabbed them firmly under the shoulders, moving them really quickly to the inside of my hoodie. They didn't like it at all but its being cruel to be kind, I think .

They still don't especially enjoy being picked up but they tolerate it and theyre in no rush to get away. I think they understand it is a means to an end and they usually get something nice out of it.

Someone suggested transferring them via a box or tube. Some rats like to go up your sleeve - that is my Eric's preferred way to leave the cage."
RATS,fdrziyj,t3_emx4np,1578692054.0,"

My skittish babies were happy to come out the cage and run around, even crawl on me, but I couldn't handle them. They squealed and wriggled when I picked them up, one would just shit himself and freeze then hide from me. When in my arms, theyd risk life and limb to get away. Literally. I think we had a few near misses.

I took advice from this sub (see my one and only post) and got a lot of useful information from the Isamu Rat Care site and YouTube channel. I realised my boys didn't know me or their boundaries. Everything was still very new them and it was probably exciting and scary and overwhelming all at once.

Because they were such good escape artists and they love to hide away, the method I chose was to carry them inside my hoodie for 30 minutes at a time, several times a day. Its better if you can hold them openly, I think, though.

I walked around and talked to them, with my hand inside the hoodie. I'd occasionally pet them if they came to my hand but not every time. The movement from walking around makes them feel insecure so they have to use you for safety.

Apparently after the first 15 mins, they start to get over their fear and realise nothing bad is happening to them. Another 15 mins reinforces it. I gave a treat as I put them in the cage so they associate me with nice things. 

After a couple of days, they started to climb on me a bit and tolerate more petting. The older boy nearly fell asleep on two occasions but his brother wanted his attention and woke him.  They get very jealous, weirdly.

I'm now at a stage where i think they know its me that gives them the good things - food and freedom - and they literally scramble up the cage as soon as I walk in the room. They  still love to be inside my hoodie or dressing gown, they tolerate any kind of handling but I've now been sat for over an hour with the cage open and they haven't even attempted to get out. I still call them scaredy-rats."

I've moved onto dust-extracted small flake shavings as it's soooo cheap. I got it from an equestrian supply place. 

I would do as you said, fix a 'proper' litter tray in the place they're happy to use. 

Bird toys are generally good for rats but they can be pricey. The ladders and ropes are great for climbing and you can move them around  to create new challenges. I got a few dog ropes from the pound shop (dollar store) and link them together.

Hard wood is safest for chewing. You can buy bundles of sticks like apple and willow, or if you have any trees nearby, you can wash and dry them out yourself. Naturalistic cages often have tree branches for climbing etc. 

The advice I've gleaned from people who've had rats a long time is to fill the cage. Don't leave big gaps. A lot of cages I see are very pretty but theyre not actually that exciting from a rat's pov. This is one instance where more is better!

I have a 3 storey Lazy Bones cage which are much cheaper to buy new. I took the shelves and ramps out though,to better utilise the space and because cleaning mesh is a horrible chore.  They really, really love to piss on it. 
 https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Lazy-Bones-Chinchilla-Rat-Ferret-Metal-Cage-1-2-3-Storey-Optional-Stand-Wheels-/283361579002

but I was very lucky to get it locally for a tenner! 

Pros: 

it feels very solid and very secure. The cage fit inside the metal base and clips onto the rim. The mesh is small enough for even the babiest rat. The doors open inwards and lock securely. No one is getting out!

The shelves can be adjusted or removed. 

The mesh makes it easy to hang and attach lots of items. 
Handles on the side to lift it.

Two front doors, top opens fully. 

Can buy other units and extend it, potentially


Cons:

It's mesh. I can't stress how horrible it is to keep clean.

It's mesh.  If you keep the shelving in, they *will* piss on it and you will struggle to find effective floor covering (I tried towels, fleece, cardboard, Hessian).

It's mesh. It's virtually impossible too take a decent photo through the bars. 

The doors open inwards and they're just not big enough. its really annoying. 

It's really not as pretty as the savic cages.

Did I mention the mesh?"
RATS,eyyne9f,t1_eyxw8p5,1567595650.0,"It's very similar to mine but the mesh spacing is very small so its hard to attach flooring.. So far I've tried covering the ramps and floors with cardboard fleece and towels, using zip ties, safety pins or paperclips. They manage to drag up any fabric and seem to especially hate it on the ramps. One them likes to lay on the mesh flooring underneath. The other just pisses on it. The cardboard (mostly) stays put,if its the really thick stuff. 

I'm currently trialling cardboard covered in hessian sacking. They chew the edges but not pulling it up. Yet.  When I have more climbing stuff to fill the gaps,I intend to remove the ramps and one of the shelves."
