nihilism,fglct98,t3_eylwjd,1580891213.0,"You can believe nihilism to be true and believe that everything is meaningless (which it is), but as sentient beings we have desires, and we crave to fulfill them. There’s different ways to go about it. This isn’t necessarily selfishness though, because one of your desires can be to save other people. You can be a nihilist and still put effort into living a good life, but if you are a nihilist you realize there is no need to put effort, and likewise there is no need to put no effort. There can be pleasure in relaxing, and there can be pleasure in extreme thrills.

So just do whatever you want. Just continue fulfilling your desires, whatever that looks like for you."
nihilism,fglcalu,t3_eytfjk,1580890503.0,"Taoism - ancient Chinese tradition/philosophy. Key concepts: Tao, Wu-Wei, Ziran, Te. Very interesting and compatible with nihilism. The founder and people that expanded on the founder advocated for living in accordance to nature and your natural desires. Ziran means “so of itself”, and it’s the word they use to describe nature, basically another term for meaningless. I love Taoism and resonate with it deeply, it’s like nihilism but more refined."
nihilism,fglbx39,t3_eyxe9m,1580890002.0,"It’s impossible. You can have a universe that has an actual god governing it, like the Christian god, but behind what the god would create and enforce there is no meaning. Why does this god exist? The concept of objective meaning is flawed, it doesn’t have a basis in reality."
nihilism,fglbm3b,t3_ez3btm,1580889611.0,"It was gradual for me. I was raised Catholic and was put in Christian schools but I broke away in my early teens. I’m not sure if I ever took it seriously but it was around 18 or 19 that I felt confident that everything is meaningless and purposeless.

The cool thing about nihilism compared to religion is nihilism has proof and logic behind it while religion is only stories that you have to trust. Once you do enough thinking you will eventually come to a point where you are completely confident in your nihilistic belief because you know they’re correct. If you understand nihilism correctly it can be very freeing and conducive to happiness, definitely more-so than you would ever get from religion, because you’re free yet grounded in reality this way,"
DeepThoughts,fgl8c39,t3_ez31t3,1580885620.0,"This is a common thought for people that get into deep thinking and philosophy but it’s not quite on the mark.

You do need a brain to process everything and your brain is where everything happens but for your brain to operate it’s necessary to have a nervous system, and a skull around it, and blood, among other things in your body. And not only that, if there were no phenomena for your brain to experience then you wouldn’t even exist, because the brain and the environment go together. So it’s actually all necessary, not just the mind."

nihilism,fgk24ap,t1_fgjpuln,1580855910.0,"Who defines what this code is? No one. This law you’re speaking of is something imagined, it’s not an actuality. It is impossible for there to be a guide for how people “should” act, it’s only opinions.

Edit: Looking back I realize now my previous comment was a poor response. But what I'm really trying to say is there is no law built into the universe. Behind everything is meaninglessness. Behind workplace ethics and government laws and the UN is meaninglessness, and freedom. Even though you may be reprimanded for breaking these surface levels laws, there is no reason behind those laws."

AlanWatts,fggf2t4,t1_fggejc3,1580760531.0,"Maybe. But what I’m saying is anxiety actually can make a change to what’s going to happen, contrary to what Alan says in this quote. You’re right that anxiety is unavoidable, and relatively minor anxiety can be lived with harmoniously, but Alan is implying that all anxiety will not make a difference to what’s going to happen, so anxiety disorders and other extremely stressful situations are actually good examples for why Alan is wrong here."
nihilism,fggema6,t1_fggbu4v,1580760255.0,"A common misunderstanding of nihilism, which you seem to be caught in the middle of unfortunately, is that nihilism means chaos and destruction and explicit selfishness. You can follow moral nihilism and existential nihilism and still care for others and the planet. When you follow these ideas you’re only realizing that your efforts are not “the law”, or objectively correct.

It is true that to live a harmonious and good life that you do so by getting along with other people, rather than fighting against them constantly, or living in fear of them. I’m not saying it’s necessary to agree with everything they say, but try to find a common ground and proceed from there. So you’re right in that regard, that individual prosperity goes in conjunction with the collective prosperity (to an extent).

So nihilism is not an advocation for any harmful thing, it is only saying that there are no objective laws to follow or remember. It is possible for there to be selfish nihilists, but that is only their personal choice, nihilism doesn’t advocate for that.

nihilism,fgg6ezt,t3_ey2d4w,1580755240.0,"You can be a nihilist and feel anything. Nihilism doesn’t prescribe any feelings, nihilism is a belief. All there is to it."

It seems the Nietzche had a misunderstanding of the benefits of nihilism. Nihilism isn’t the only philosophy that believes life is meaningless, this can also be found in Eastern traditions such as Buddhism, Zen Buddhism, and Taoism, and, as I’m sure you know, the goal of these traditions is enlightenment.

I resonate with nihilism and I live a pretty happy life. Nietzche seemed focused on the negative aspect of nihilism, which is that life is not worth living because there is no meaning, but a person who is thinking in this way is caught between the ideals of nihilism and regular societal and religious thinking– if they went all the way into nihilism then they would find joy. Someone who is raised in western society is likely to still crave comfort in the false belief that life is going somewhere and that we *must* put effort in maintaining various things, because that is the popular belief and the belief that has been instilled in their heads by other people since birth, but it’s not necessary.

The popular understanding of nihilism has evolved over time. Just look at optimistic nihilism. To say that nihilism is wrong or unhealthy is 1. Ignoring the facts and 2. Ignoring the large amount of people (from both East and West) that benefit from the belief that life is meaningless and purposeless."

spirituality,fgdn3ie,t3_exwrqd,1580684300.0,"It’s impossible to not have a worldview. Your thinking that you don’t have a worldview is a worldview in itself. You thinking that you know nothing is knowledge in itself. If you think you are wrong you secretly feel that you are right in thinking you’re wrong, in a subtle way.

It will never be possible for there not to be issues. Once we solve all our current issues there will be new issues to take their place. Once you see genuinely that your issues will never end you can rest in the moment."
