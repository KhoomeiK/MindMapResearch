Psoriasis,febzj1a,t3_eo4yug,1578964589.0,Neutrogena T Gel (extra strength) works great for me. It kind of has an old lady/ moth ball scent to it so I try to keep it to once a day but it’s a small price to pay for a scalp that doesn’t itch

MilitaryHistory,fcuofz0,t1_fcun7yy,1577985303.0,Dehumanizing your enemy in an effort to rationalize killing them isn’t a surprising concept at all. I’d venture to say that a small percentage of veterans end up “feeling nothing” for those they kill in combat when all is said and done. Unless they’re complete sociopaths of course
