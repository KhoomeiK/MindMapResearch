Instead, the judge was admonishing the one disruptive guy, went on a rant, then held the woman who reacted to the guy by ""smirking"" or ""smiling"" after she exited the room.  The judge was already triggered by the first person and went off on the second one---and for what?  If the judge is so easily distracted, she should clear the courtroom of all onlookers.

We don't know if they were warned before, but 93 days is beyond excessive---greater than many states' guidelines for those found guilty of class B misdemeanors.

Sadly, the fact that any judge with a chip on their shoulder can summarily try criminal contempt cases without a jury is one of the great shortcomings of the US legal system.  In particular, this is counter to the 1st amendment (freedom of speech), the 5th amendment (deprived of liberty without due process and right to jury trial) , and the 8th amendment (protection against cruel and unusual punishment)."
