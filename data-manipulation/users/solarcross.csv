**WARNING**

If this light does not illuminate briefly after the ignition switch is turned ON or the light illuminates steadily after blinking for approximately one minute, you should have your Tire Pressure Monitoring System checked at a SUBARU dealer as soon as possible.

If this light illuminates while driving, never brake suddenly and keep driving straight ahead while gradually reducing speed. Then slowly pull off the road to a safe place.

Otherwise an accident involving serious vehicle damage and serious personal injury could occur.

If this light still illuminates while driving after adjusting the tire pressure, a tire may have significant damage and a fast leak that causes the tire to lose air rapidly. If you have a flat tire, replace it with a spare tire as soon as possible.

When a spare tire is mounted or a wheel rim is replaced without the original pressure sensor/transmitter being transferred, the Low tire pressure warning light will illuminate steadily after blinking for approximately one minute.

I am not saying a 15 year old understands the intricacies and dangers of sexual activity. I am saying the opposite. Most of us got sexually active before ANY inclination of ""intricacies"" or responsibility or any sense of consequence even came to the light of consciousness, this does not mean it is morally ""wrong"", simply ""human"". I know, embedded within western culture it may seem like the world in which we live has ""evolved"" from ancient absurd A to modern B to morally correct C, but that's just cultural blindness. The curiosities we eventually codify into laws and social norms will continue to change and morph through the years, and it does not follow an upward cohesive and rational narrative. You do not stand at the pinnacle of evolution by accusing me of saying a 15 year old is ready for sex. In no way did I say that, try to muster a little more intellect rather than falling back on reactionary attitudes combed by knee-jerk religious fanaticism served up by american media puppets. You are conditioned to hate the idea that people have sex outside of the law, that it is somehow ""wrong"" and reprehensible, and that whoever challenges those assumptions must be the polar opposite of that- a demon possessed child abuser.

This shit ain't black & white, nor will it ever be. Obviously we can use common sense on a certain level here and come to a broad conclusion that litigation of sexual abuse, harassment, and misconduct ought to be under the purview of social law, but deviance? How do we define that? How do we put a law on some kids messing around with each other? On my wrongfully prosecuted brother? Or my own experience- I can tell you I did not think ONE single time about the consequences when the girl called me up to take her virginity, all I could do was be filled with excitement for a new adventure in life, heart pounding, one of the best memories I have. We were not of age.

Most of our mothers' have had abortions, some of the girls I was with in highschool (once) and after highschool (once) had to get an abortion simply because we were young and dumb and a condom isn't the best defense.

Regardless of how a society treats each case, whether it breaks the law or the people are shunned by their hometown peers (countless plots to 80's movies here), there will be no law as ineffectual as one that biologically and psychologically defends against the sexual impulse. All we can ever hope for are laws that help safeguard that, but even those are quite fallible. All I'm saying is it's not black & white, it's not a polarized subject, it should be treated with much more thoughtfulness than just the regurgitation of cancel culture, outrage culture, call-out culture, internet vigilantism, slacktivism, online shaming, and other social media contrived cancers that are so fashionable as virtue signaling today.

Does anyone even know the details regarding the Bowie incident? And how she feels years later about it? Or if he ever talked about it before death? Or any necessary conversation to validate their subjective experience of it instead of speculating? There's a lot to uncover here, so let's not resort to banal superficial argumentation on contemporary american ""shoulds and shouldn'ts"". We are all very well versed in that.  


And you state ""who am I to say what should and shouldn't be""? I would ask the same of you. I would ask the same of the state. In fact, that's what my whole post is about, not trying to define sexual ""rights"" and wrongs"", but exploring them without moralistic assumptions. How do you know David Bowie is a bad person? You ever jerked off to porn before? Maybe a little excursion into your history would be more revealing than your flaccid arguments.  


Edit: Some misspelled words"
stopdrinking,fdkqysc,t1_fdklekn,1578509319.0,"Well, in NC in the 90s you were ""okay"" if you were both 16 years old or older. In the case of my brother he had reached that age while the girl he hooked up with had not, whereas in my case both the girl and I were younger than the age of legal consent. I agree that david Bowie fucked up if he was in his twenties messing around with a 14 year old, sure, but I'm drawing a larger point- that our laws do not define morals or ethics and that human being live in a different order prescribed to us through the dictates of social norms and constraints. I am sure we are all aware that in days yonder, just a mere half a century ago, the human race as a whole followed very different guidelines and in no way is that to be taken as condoning sexual misconduct. Sexual instincts can take over as early as 12 now for girls, their maturation process has been significantly rolled back earlier than even a few decades ago where the norm was around age 15, and science has not yet found the culprit although the theories are myriad.   


I can be downvoted all you want by you outstanding moralistic citizens, but that won't dispel a thing regarding human histories entrenched in what we refer to as ""deviant"" behaviour within sexual dynamics- from Man-boy love (romans, greeks), erotic eccentricities (marquis de sade), marked age differences (harold & maude), to even ""darker"" themes or cultural norms (marrying young into wealthy families for prestige and property \*something many of you enjoy in your period piece cinematic experiences as romantic\* and/or arranged marriages- takes place in both tribal societies As Well As ""Civilized Societies""), sexual expression will always be messy and undefinable through a morally correct lens. There will be no point in the future when everyone is satiated by any set of definitions regarding the comfort and safety of sexual encounters at the expense of human desire, especially heteronormative state law sanctioned sex.   


The more we understand this, the less frantic we will become concerning sexual deviance. I personally am all for laws that protect state interpreted definitions of a ""child"" in relationship with an ""adult"". But as for judicial actions against those who break these laws I think we need to think a little more about the nuances of each case. I've met 15 year olds that were more conscious of their actions and surroundings than 38 year olds, that's not to say they are ready for sex, but it's also not to say they aren't."
stopdrinking,fdkl7xc,t1_fdkihu9,1578505855.0,"My brother was 16 when he hooked up with a 15 year old girl at a party, she had a bf who found out and told her dad for retaliation. He tried to murder my brother but the cops got there in time. The sex was consential but since was in trouble by both her dad and bf she made up a story that she was passed out. She was not. My brother got statutory rape charges. My brother has to file as a sex offender to this day. Her father didn’t get any jail time, my brother did.

I was 15 and had sex with a 13 year old girl at her request. We were stupid, but thought we were in love and all grown up. Luckily I only turned 16 afterwards, but we remain friends to this day. 

I get why we set certain ages illegal as a society to protect the young and dumb, but don’t think that the legal age limit for statutory somehow stops teenage hormones or prevents the inevitable lure of sexual awakening in our youth. It may help in many cases, but it is only a man made law that can be abused and exploited just as much as any other man made law."
