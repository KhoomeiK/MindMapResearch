MonsterHunterWorld,ffj2bpx,t1_ffj0zce,1579988620.0,The new one from the gratitude festival
MonsterHunterWorld,ffj29gj,t1_ffi9n1j,1579988576.0,"You mean layered? Yeah I hope so too,though I actually rock the full set atm bc I like the five piece set effect"
MonsterHunterWorld,ffj23gz,t3_etrdxu,1579988456.0,"Man I love the Shara set, though it is a bit over the top at times, just being able to get rid of a couple things on the armour would make it perfect"
Warframe,ffhn2dh,t3_etjy8k,1579943250.0,How about we just get rid of all the information and show us a picture of our frames standing there. Problem solved
gamedev,ffhm4em,t3_etbowh,1579941824.0,Look like greatswords from monster hunter
MonsterHunterWorld,fezqo3q,t1_fezpazj,1579460432.0,"Yeah basically anything that couldn't effect someone else's experience in multiplayer is alright, mostly bc they don't lose anything if you give yourself all the resources as it has nothing to do with the stuff they sell to you."
MonsterHunterWorld,fezqct1,t3_eqt9gi,1579460323.0,"I might use that mod, though I'm not to much of a fan of the overly skimpy armour"
destiny2,fezdya8,t3_eqyjxq,1579456359.0,Is this a real one or a mock up
MonsterHunterWorld,fexk4ej,t1_fexjz31,1579432295.0,Yeah at least he is known for his regeneration abilities
MonsterHunterWorld,fexjnv9,t1_fetefso,1579432070.0,"Weren't we also able to carve the ruiner nergigante we fought before? Not sure anymore, but that one seemed to come back to live too"
MonsterHunterWorld,fexjeph,t1_feudikq,1579431956.0,"I'm pretty sure it's just air,he has also holes in his chest which is what I assume is where he sucks the air in mad is probably also what makes the song we heard the whole time"
MonsterHunterWorld,fexiwya,t3_eqfutn,1579431730.0,Man I really like his design and I'm so happy with the design of his armour
Warframe,fexfckj,t1_few282u,1579430079.0,Sounds amazing but not sure if possible with their engine
MonsterHunter,fexeab2,t3_eqk5wp,1579429596.0,Man I fucking love Shara Ishvalda it's one of my fav monsters and probably my fav elderdragon in world at least.
Warframe,feox9p4,t1_feox4t4,1579307383.0,I mean I think he has some of the best tenno gen skins but his deluxe us not so good
pics,feovun1,t1_feotkxc,1579306516.0,"The thing is though he is actually a really good actor, George Lucas us just a shitty writer (or who ever wrote the screenplay for the prequels)"
Warframe,feov1x2,t1_feosigi,1579306039.0,"So why is it than that it seems to be a bigger deal this time, as we will have to opt in through the game launcher to have the new render active (at least in the beginning (PC only))"
Warframe,feouwlz,t1_feou53f,1579305950.0,Really? I had a different experience with my Excalibur and Loki. My Loki having a none invisibility tanky build that is probably still less tanky than most none tank builds for any other frame.
raidsecrets,feoumwu,t1_feo2geg,1579305801.0,"Well you say they wouldn't make that mistake again but then they do the same mistakes over and over again, it wouldn't surprise me if they come out and say that this content was planned before Niobe labs came out and they couldn't change it anymore bc their production time line is just so fucking fucked up and bad that they can't change stuff halve a year in advance. Like seriously I know making video game sis hard and conplexe and they are a giant company that makes changing stuff alot harder, but compared to how insanely flexible other developers are it does seem like there are a lot of management problems at bungie"
raidsecrets,feotqsx,t1_fenypsw,1579305347.0,That was the name I came up with when I thought we might get an exotic version of the perfect paradox this season
Warframe,feoslj9,t1_feosfmn,1579304829.0,"Hm good to know, so veil is to much but Saturn seems to be ok for most frames"
Warframe,feos5to,t1_feoqs2i,1579304658.0,"Ok thx didn't hear about that, just heard Steve say that their would be a new render"
Warframe,feorw85,t3_eq76hw,1579304586.0,"They definitely need to change the scaling it takes way too long for low tier enemies to become dangerous and at some point high end enemies become just insane. I personally really enjoy the boarding party enemies in railjack as they are somewhat tanky and do good damage bit are not out right broken, maybe they get a little bit to strong in veil missions but I have only played those with a tanky frame so I can't tell. 
On a different note I do think that Warframe can't achieve good difficulty as long as it stays a horde shooter, at that point it's almost only numbers that determine success and while a bit of that is important and fun, so that builds actually matter, it just can't be the only thing. And bc adding more interesting mechanisms into the fight would get to much with the current enemy count I think we need to reduce them a bit."
Warframe,feoqgpp,t1_feohrun,1579303969.0,Well Loki Def needs a better deluxe skin than his current one
Warframe,feoqb5k,t1_feoio0i,1579303878.0,To be fair I don't think that if that skin was added that those errors would come with the 3D model as it wouldn't fit the animation skeleton amyway
Warframe,feopy95,t1_feoju0h,1579303763.0,"Except that they are adding the different/new renderer this month, but yes even then it would take a lot more time if they even want to add them. And who knows maybe the new renderer doesn't make the stuff look better anyway."
MonsterHunterWorld,feootmp,t3_epx7ry,1579303255.0,"Yeah I think female armour is pretty ugly most of the time, when I am a badass hunter I don't want to walk around in skimpy clothes, but I guess it's just me."
raidsecrets,fen4i5u,t3_epy29c,1579276785.0,How would other bows be able to do it if it's liked to the broadhead perk
raidsecrets,fen4ayo,t1_femkg75,1579276660.0,Sadly you can't shot through walls so probably not
blackmagicfuckery,fegbwxo,t3_eor7d3,1579086866.0,"I love how much of this sub is just chemistry, shows how interesting science can be."
Warframe,feg5tmk,t1_feg1a0o,1579078303.0,"I think that's a bit unfair to say, sure they obviously do alot of stuff with the intent to make them money. But they have also done a shit ton of updates that had no way of making them money"
Warframe,feg5mdd,t1_feeo2bz,1579078027.0,They might not have been able to code it that way. Railjack is using alot of tricks to make us think we are actually flying that thing. And maybe exactly those things might mean that if we were able to excess our arsenal the game would just break.
Warframe,feg5ifr,t3_eorq3t,1579077878.0,I'm pretty sure they really want to but I wouldn't be surprised if it's pretty difficult to do and they tried and failed. So I wouldn't hold my breath to much
raidsecrets,feg5568,t3_eoqbzo,1579077380.0,What you talking about? What did I miss
DestinyLore,feboqzj,t1_feascgr,1578961065.0,They are also the most likely faction to ally with us in the fight against the darkness
DestinyLore,feb2fkt,t1_feajlaj,1578954844.0,"They can create an infinite amount of drones they just can't procreate also nothing about ballas tinkering made her infertile, it's the void that did that"
DestinyLore,feaieb0,t1_feahntq,1578949180.0,"Where did you get that info from? That lotus got that ability from ballas? I'm pretty sure it has also been hinted at that she had the ability before the alliance with ballas. And even if not that still doesn't fix their problems that just means they can make some more drones

Edit: the thing she talks in the ropalolyst fight about are the amalgams"
DestinyLore,feah4gr,t1_fe4emvg,1578948630.0,"Sentience are still infertile they never had the problem of creating more drones, they always could do that. The problem they had and still have is that they can't reproduce anymore meaning creating new sentient life."
DestinyLore,feag9zb,t3_enndho,1578948349.0,Guardians are basically unkilllabe and Tenno are most certainly unkilllabe by Guardians. But Tenno might not be able to destroy a ghost? So maybe an even battle maybe not. But I do also think that Warframe are quite a bit stronger
DestinyLore,feabikp,t1_fe8o7qp,1578946649.0,"I allied with the drifter and I hope I get to choose as I would definitely welcome him back, I'm not mad at him at all"
DestinyLore,feab37c,t1_fe8k7mb,1578946495.0,Not sure where you read that but definitely not in the in the dawning ship lore tab
DestinyLore,fea52yd,t3_enzgpz,1578944458.0,"Well apparently guardians aren't allowed to dig up their past, so maybe that's why he doesn't tell"
DestinyTheGame,fe0qtlk,t3_en7ru1,1578817599.0,While I do agree with you I also actually really liked season of the forge
destiny2,fdqxzox,t3_emmg8l,1578676479.0,I really need to finish that rat king catalyst though
magicTCG,fdhx77y,t3_elco2y,1578431786.0,It's got eidolon in its name and is white. Nice
raidsecrets,fd4xz75,t1_fd3tm3g,1578172220.0,Good bc I have really been looking forward to that one
borderlands3,fcyxt20,t3_ejgrqo,1578089443.0,Have they? Never noticed before
facepalm,fcyx2z8,t1_fcyx0mw,1578088981.0,"Ah thx good to know, haven't seen any news today."
facepalm,fcywr4q,t1_fcyspvk,1578088771.0,What did he do then?
facepalm,fcyqz95,t3_ejg9bc,1578085264.0,I assume he attacked Iran?
raidsecrets,fcyaea9,t1_fcxg5t8,1578077093.0,Thx
raidsecrets,fcx38ed,t1_fcx37f0,1578049269.0,Yeah saw that too after I wrote this
raidsecrets,fcwz6mp,t1_fcwgt12,1578043990.0,How do we know that it is in South America?
raidsecrets,fcwysyj,t3_ej7lx6,1578043491.0,Doesn't the lore tab say he can see the city from his location? You can't see the city from the edz so I assume his is not anywhere where we can currently go to
Warframe,fcty3cx,t3_eiqgvp,1577965311.0,Vampir Mode ist easy Mode for pretty much every frame
Warframe,fcqmolb,t1_fcqmir3,1577888708.0,"I don't think vor was a thing back then, I'm pretty sure that was still closed beta, back when Warframe still had a skill tree. And if he was a thing back then, then he still looked like a normal grineer butcher"
Warframe,fcqjoo3,t1_fcqi0nq,1577887201.0,"I guess but I think the stuff that references western culture directly breaks my immersion the most i.e. stage magician and cowgirl, while something as abstract an everything eating frame is fine by me"
Warframe,fcpxunk,t1_fcpben6,1577874492.0,"First it was only corpus ships and grineer enemies on them, then the grineer got their own gallion tileset, after I think it went, asteroid, earth, Venus, mars, Jupiter, shipyard, Europa, Uranus, lua and then kuva"
Warframe,fcp0kjq,t1_fcp0hnd,1577846800.0,"Fair enough, I just thought that the fact how stupid the question was that it would have been clear enough but I guess not :)"
Warframe,fcp0e5m,t1_fcp0bqg,1577846648.0,I'm not sure if you got that I was joking or not
destiny2,fcp091f,t1_fco2bm1,1577846531.0,So basically lord of wolf's as a primary
destiny2,fcp020n,t3_eibw8f,1577846367.0,Looks good but not intimidating
Warframe,fcozmy6,t1_fcozfnf,1577846026.0,"Squads wouldn't help much though as his thighs are normal but his calves are too small for you I assume. 
I generally like the skin just the helmet and shoulder are not quite as I would like them"
Showerthoughts,fcozh66,t3_ei8f3y,1577845899.0,Hahaha you think there will be people born in the 2090's
Warframe,fcoygdz,t1_fcoxr7s,1577845068.0,"Well they basically already have one of the tilesets, second this game had the same tilesets for most of its planets for a long time, third point would be that I doubt the tau system would have as many planets as the sol system I would assume 4-5 different planets with 3-4 different tilesets the one they already got included"
Warframe,fcoxeod,t1_fcol2gt,1577844217.0,Them creating a second star chart for the Tau system isn't that far fetched and not that hard if it would work like the normal star chat. They basically just have to make some new tilesets
Warframe,fcox9ge,t1_fco8jnb,1577844098.0,"War within came out less than one year after the second dream.

Second dream release date: December 25th 2015
War within release date: December 9th 2016"
Warframe,fcovjqc,t1_fcohed3,1577842741.0,But how many nezha pieces did he get?
Warframe,fcon8tv,t1_fcon0y8,1577836481.0,"I know I'm glad too, and to be honest I really don't get myself why it is him in particular I hate so much while stuff like Mesa doesn't bother me and I actually really like mirage (prime at least)"
Warframe,fcoivq7,t1_fcohgnf,1577833324.0,I just really hate the gentleman/stage-magician theme
Warframe,fcohd8v,t1_fcnnvhv,1577832259.0,The proto skins are not canon and DE has stated multiple times that Dark Sector is not in the same univers as Warframe
Warframe,fcofr2i,t1_fcnw1is,1577831155.0,"Oh yeah especially bc limbo looks like shit (still like him though) he just looks so ugly and does not fit, so much so that I still cant play him without his deluxe skin"
pics,fcodlez,t3_ei5jq2,1577829645.0,Seems not that bad actually
Warframe,fco9pr8,t3_ei3gf3,1577826957.0,I also enjoy when you mess with their controlled and they smash into them
Warframe,fco9hlb,t1_fcnprrw,1577826803.0,You can also stay in relays/Cetus/Fortuna indefinitely as well as the plains and orb vallis (at least when you are on solo mode)
Warframe,fco7615,t1_fcnc8by,1577825383.0,While I personally like the cy stuff I do think that a option to make him only say the most useful stuff would be appreciated
Warframe,fco5wzc,t1_fco5o58,1577824685.0,I wonder if it also removes the stupid line from lotus were she wonders for the 200th time what that weird kuva Syphon thingy is
Warframe,fco5ryi,t1_fco5o58,1577824615.0,"Well that's fine I think, good to know. Seems I don't have that option enabled after all or it's just bugged for me"
Warframe,fco5m23,t3_ei46rh,1577824526.0,"As far as I'm aware Pets 2.0 is pretty much done at this point, but it's linked to a Arsenal/UI rework which takes quite a bit longer"
Warframe,fco5e96,t1_fcni24i,1577824405.0,"Well the damage 3.0 stuff only didn't happen bc we didn't want it, or at least not the version they came up with."
Warframe,fco4zvw,t1_fcmtu0v,1577824190.0,"Are you sure that it disables those too, I'm pretty sure o have that option enabled too and I still here those lines"
Warframe,fco4tug,t3_ei1nie,1577824098.0,Didn't they put in an option at the beginning of the year that was supposed to cut out the tutorial like lines from lotus? I am really confused that those lines were not on the list of lines that are not played.
destiny2,fcnl5br,t1_fcnjwaa,1577813636.0,No
Warframe,fci2i95,t1_fcfi09c,1577656965.0,"Well Steve did say that if raid would come back, they would come back with the squad link system and probably not the old 8 player system. But that doesn't mean that raids have to be connected to railjack"
destiny2,fcfqzrm,t3_egy27i,1577632864.0,"I'm really disappointed with the selection of pure white and black shaders in the game, monochrome is the only good white shader I can think of right now, and there are basically no good pure black ones"

Warframe,fcal475,t3_egte24,1577571359.0,I think the most I ever had was shedu on top of my archmeele my archgun and my other archgun (atmosphere). That was a cluster fuck
Warframe,fcakubi,t3_egq06f,1577571189.0,"I really like the way the game plays with the lower enemy count and higher enemy HP, I personally think that they feel the best in the higher Saturn levels and maybe the early veil ones. But I do think that the damage should be dialed down a little bit."
animationcareer,fc8cjhu,t1_fc895gr,1577531849.0,"Thx dir the insight, had this question on my mind for a while now and you answered it very well"
animationcareer,fc83yy9,t1_fc6uchp,1577526340.0,It's weird how I heard this Tipp more in the animation industry than any other. Any idea why being a dick might be worse if you are an animator then if you are in other fields?
raidsecrets,fc83dj9,t1_fc7k2iy,1577525883.0,Didn't they fix that bug
