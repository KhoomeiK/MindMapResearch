politics,ff75ib5,t1_ff6590j,1579641526.0,"This is less about Hillary in 2016 trying to do something in 2020 and more about someone or something wanting a distraction. 

Bernie is stuck in the trial, so anything that brings him attention is good. Not saying he’s behind the doc, just that it doesn’t hurt him because clear he was well liked. Etc. 

Trump also needs a distraction from the Senate trial. 

And The media needs readers and Hillary is their go-to  whipping post. Ah, look at all the ad dollars pouring in. And of course she doesn’t help herself and other times they just misquote her, as happened recently. 

As I understand it, the documentary uses a quote from 2016 and it’s not at all relevant today, except for those who want to use her old comments to pump up their base. 

It’s just Pavlovian:

“Hillary says something”  and rabid public salivates and barks its head off until that bell is rung again. 

The only difference is who profits. 

And it’s not any of us."

I thank my off-loader brace (protecting my torn meniscus) and primal movement exercises for making deep squat  possible."

AdobeIllustrator,fe3obx4,t3_enotw0,1578851271.0,"I really like it.  I like the color choices and the main card icons.  The graphics and the line art around the images are cool.  I especially like the pattern on the black card.   


I'm no expert, but some thoughts: 

There's no reason to include a period after every card title.  

The line weight is the same, but that does a disservice to the dragon on the ocean and the griffin on the The Sun. The cool facial details get lost and overcrowded.

The black card and its card icons.  First, I'm puzzled as to what the main icon on the black card represents.  Second I would have thought that the icons on the other cards would be represented around the black card's icon. You may have something completely different and better in mind.

scooters,fe01gjs,t3_enh2ys,1578800720.0,"DON’T get anything less than a 150cc. Opt for the license.  You’ll quickly get bored w the slow 50cc and you also don’t have any power to get yourself out of trouble fast. 

That said I don’t recommend a 150cc for the highway. Again, Not enough power to get out of trouble. 

I rode Kymco 150 for years. Bought new with 2 year warranty. I run it into the ground. Reliable. 

I now ride a Piaggio BV 350. 2 year warranty. Top speed 85-90. Both bikes are narrow for lane splitting, which is legal in CALI. if you got good credit, piaggio has 1.9% financing. I pay like $157 a month. I save that much and more on gas and parking. It’s expensive to park in LA. but bikes park for free.

I love this bike."

motivation,fdj3ys4,t3_eld0et,1578457812.0,"I've been outside of everything all my life. Much of it, my choice. I don't see the point of hurting or cheating others to amass whatever. The Golden Rule is golden.  I don't care about things.  Instead, I  think what would Heaven on Earth be for me and I do that. That might be different for everyone, but for me, Heaven on Earth is dog walking/petsitting.  I did the 9-5 thing as a web content developer, and a few other jobs, and being in a cubicle 8-10 hours a day, being inside all day and I felt like I was dying, like I was fucking dying. I don't know how people go to work in a box all day to pay for homes, another box, they barely spend any time in.  I walk a dog, breath fresh air, and look up at the blue sky every day. That's my office.

I dunno. We're all gonna die. I look at classic paintings with the peasants from like 400 years ago and think that's me, the stupid schmuck in the corner. I hope he or she is happy.  Because that's all there is.  Life is short. Enjoy it."
