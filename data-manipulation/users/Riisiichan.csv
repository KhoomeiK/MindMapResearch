> Although voters overwhelmingly approved the Clean Missouri amendment in 2018, some lawmakers want to change the redistricting provisions that were included. Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, said it’s expected to be the first topic discussed in the Senate. 

> “In spite of that measure getting 62% of the vote, I don’t really know what the people said yes to,” Eigel said. “Was it Sunshine Law changes? Was it campaign contribution limit changes? Was it redistricting changes?” 

> Both Republicans and Democrats have some concerns with the amendment, but Quade said she intends on pushing back on any proposed changes. 

> “Not everyone in our caucus agrees with every piece of Clean Missouri, but the voters overwhelmingly told us that’s what they wanted,” she said.

> Haahr did not outline any specific changes to Clean Missouri, which calls for a nonpartisan state demographer to draw legislative districts."

Costo is largely triggered by poor posture and with the right amount of thought and stretching, can be treated. The most important first step you can take is to stop slouching. You also need to start stretching your upper back everyday. Checkout Door Frame Stretches for Costo on Youtube. A Foam Roller will also help to massage and stretch out your back. The best tool in our arsenal by far is the Backpod. It will do the most to correct your posture issues and give relief when used correctly. I personally went on an Anti-Inflammatory diet when I first got Costo and I highly recommend it. For stress, anxiety, and pain relief you can take CBD Oil. Finally, try not to sleep on your side as this agitates your already inflamed ribs."

costochondritis,fcn97ir,t1_fcn8gb0,1577806503.0,"I had been trying other things originally, like the Door Frame Stretches and Foam Roller before I bought the Backpod. So I had already seen some positive results from that, as well as going on an anti-inflammatory diet and using CBD Oil as an EpiPen. That being said, I personally saw results about 3 months in. At first I did not watch the Official Backpod video on Youtube that shows you how to properly use it, so I hurt myself. It took about a month for the pain I caused to subside and then it was all good from there. 

I like to remind others who suffer that there is no quick fix to re-aligning your spine. It took years of pressure for you to do the damage and so it’s possible it may take a year or so for you to reverse it. Persistence will pay off in the end. In the mean time, we’re here for you to share all of your worries and doubts with. You are not alone."
