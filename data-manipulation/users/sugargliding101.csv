AskReddit,fc870m4,t1_fc86sjb,1577528284.0,I was thinking about a bottle of soda actually! We have a russian market in our city that I like going to... I’ll bring back little snacks every time I go. Last time was a bottle of strawberry soda. He liked it a lot! Might have to do that again.
AskWomen,fc83l5b,t3_egj755,1577526053.0,"Hmmm. It may seem difficult because by comparison, it’s really easy to make friends with people who see you as a possible mate. 

Some girls are just naturally friendly and bubbly... and jump at the chance to exchange numbers and hang out. Others, not so much. But the former exist in droves! You just gotta find us and smile and say you like old fashioneds and dogs."

confession,fc56uwd,t3_edlb1k,1577446237.0,"I think we all get slightly frustrated. But I’ve learned to let it go. You’ll have smart men and women in grad school who ace their papers who still flip flop you’re and your in quick texts.

I remember reading about one of the differences in the Myers Briggs personality types, where one letter can mean Sensing vs Intuitive, and how one type that’s more sensing gets irked over little things like using the wrong they’re/their. And the other one doesn’t, instead just goes with the flow and doesn’t nitpick or get bothered by it.

Half of that last paragraph is full of it. Read it a long time ago so maybe I’m forgetting it it’s sensing vs intuitive or thinking vs feeling, whatever. But it helped me unstick myself and stop worrying about the little mess ups people make."

It’s probably best though if you went from feeding them by hand to a feeder. That way they don’t lose their fear of humans and start getting too comfortable in residential areas, and you won’t be exposing yourself to disease."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fc4ypy8,t3_eg32wy,1577434276.0,"My dad bought the Samsung AirPods.. samsung sampods. Sampods. For himself a couple weeks ago. He didn’t like that he spent over 70 bucks on them and I sort of openly scoffed at him from my late twenties high horse, as *I* was wearing AirPods and *they* cost XYZ dollars...

But we sit together in the living room every day now, and I’m just happy he’s enjoying his new tech and getting to watch Star Wars movies on his laptop in peace, while mom monopolizes the tv time with cspan and the weather channel all day. 

This post made me realize that 1. I really appreciate my dad, the one who would never buy AirPods or an Apple Watch or apple anything for himself yet bought me a new iPod touch for Christmas when they first came out... and 2. Kids really are fucking stupid sometimes, especially during the holidays. Gratefulness is something learned, for sure. She’ll get it eventually."
