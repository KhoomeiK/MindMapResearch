1) drain water

2) put a towel on the lip of the tub for grip

3) carefully hoist your upper body over the toweled lip (similar to a beached whale)

4) gracefully tumbled over the side onto the bath mat"

I recommend getting some bio oil or vitamin E or something to help with the itching and discomfort.  I find scars feel tight and uncomfortable with movement...and you gotta move.

I'm sorry you had to do this. I hope you heal well and fast.  <3"

This is AIMs first year here, and they definitely had a rocky go at it. I have no sympathy for the company itself but I hope the public remembers the people who do the shit jobs."
