Has anyone actually tried and succeeded being a socially responsible consumer, avoiding anything that through any number of degrees of separation causes harm? Is there some sort of guide on how to do it because I'd love to see it.

""Just vote with your wallet"" and ""voting with your wallet is ineffective and impossible"" are equally bad faith arguments imo. I want to see someone try and do it."

AskReddit,fdk4joc,t3_elq6wb,1578495880.0,"When I was in high school, I wasn't exactly the best in terms of seducing women. I wasn't the kind of guy who could easily ask a girl out. Typical shy guy.

My junior year, though, I heard about a ""promposal"" competition. You'd ask a girl out to prom in a fanciful way and film it, and the winner would get to go to prom for free. At the time I was into filmmaking, so I was very interested in this. I was determined to get those free prom tickets. Problem was, I didn't have any particular girl to ask.

What I decided to do for the video was to make a rap and music video to ask some girl out. I wrote the lyrics, made the beat, and got everything together. Since I didn't have a girl to ask just yet, I wrote all the lyrics with the name of the girl blanked out as a placeholder. I even started filming scenes for the music video that didn't contain the girl's name to get ahead of the work required for this project. Oh, how optimistic I was that this would turn out well.

Now I just needed to get a date. I asked one girl and got rejected. Afterwards I went to ask a different girl and was rejected again. Over the course of several weeks, I asked out several different girls, getting rejected each time. In many cases I performed the rap to them, often interrupting class to do so. Here are some choice quotes from my interactions with these girls:

""I can't go with you. I was already planning to go with friends.""

""But don't you know that it's bros before hoes?""

Or the one point where I asked a girl, got rejected, and asked again the next day just in case, questioning why exactly she didn't want to go with me and if she was really sure about that.

There was also the one girl who had a boyfriend, so I checked up on her relationship status on Facebook several times a week to see if they had broken up so I could make my move. I had never met the guy and had no knowledge on the health of their relationship.

One girl actually asked me, but we had some history and she wanted to go as friends. I thought that would be awkward so I declined, but I told her the offer was still open if the other prospects didn't work out. She said that she didn't want to just be my backup, so I backpedaled and said that I might be interested actually. She did not respond to that text.

Word got around that I was doing this, so past a certain point I was locked out of any opportunities to actually get a date. No girl wanted to be my second, third, fourth, fifth, etc. choice, a fact that I was completely ignorant of at the time. My options were getting bleak, and the deadline for the video was getting close. As the number of girls I was interested in was getting smaller and smaller and my standards were getting lower and lower, I realized that I had to do something about it. I actually remember a specific girl that I was considering asking out even though I wasn't super into her. She was the tipping point, and who that person was will go to my damn grave. I had of course made about half the song and music video and had dedicated many hours of work towards this project. It couldn't have just been for nothing. So I had one option: I had to ask myself out to prom.

I bought a wig, dressed up in drag, and asked a female version of myself to prom with song and music video. With green screen magic, I was able to make it look like I was making out with the female version of myself at one point. The final project was truly a masterpiece. Er... it was something.

I uploaded and submitted the video, hoping for the best. The free prom tickets would be mine, or so I thought. I got third place. Because I was banking on winning and getting the free tickets, I did not buy any prom tickets. The tickets were sold out, so I did not go to prom that year. I got a coupon for a tuxedo rental, but since I had no use for it, it eventually just expired.

On the bright side, I did the competition again the following year and did get first place. I was smart enough to not actually rely on getting a date by rap battling my friend for his girlfriend and ""losing."" We split the ticket reimbursement and got like $20 each."
