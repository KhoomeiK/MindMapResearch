The bottom line is we need a FUCKING MOVEMENT to make real differences in this country.  None of the candidates that support Medicare for all, free public universities or the Green New Deal can make those happen without help - even Bernie.  That's why he's calling for a movement.  That's why he's aligning himself with like-minded, and luckily much younger, colleagues such as AOC and my hero Omar.  That's why he'll bring Tulsi and Yang and maybe even that cunt Warren into his cabinet.  That's why he's building a nationwide network of supporters that he plans to keep engaged AFTER he becomes president.  So he and they can continue to apply pressure to other national, state and local leaders.  So we can flip the Senate and reverse what's been happening with federal judges and SCOTUS.  So we can make real changes in the coming years - not just stand on a fucking stage and tell lies.

And if you are reading this and don't think Medicare for all, free public universities and the Green New Deal are the right direction for us - I suggest you buckle up and get ready.
