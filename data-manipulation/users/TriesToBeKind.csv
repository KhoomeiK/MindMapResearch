No, not from the CDC or the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, you don't.  At least not to actually *support* your anti-Pit Bull prejudice.  Because all the actual epidemiological DATA, contextualized scientifically to extract the subjective confirmation bias of people like you, says that Pit Bulls are NOT particularly dangerous.

GO READ THE SOURCES.  Read what the ASPCA and the Humane Society and the American Bar Association say, too.
