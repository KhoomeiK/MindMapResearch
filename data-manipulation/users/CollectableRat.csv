When you actually come up with a miracle cream the marketing infrastructure will already be in place. There's already a Miracle Cream Monthly magazine that already has 10 million subscribers in the US alone. Your product will be the number one post on all the existing miracle cream groups. Goop just means your cream *really* needs to work, because you can't just vaguely suggest it's going to work if you want to compete with all the existing placebo creams. But in any case, if people weren't spreading expensive creams on their faces in the first place then there wouldn't be demand for biochemists to make them in the first place."

Well not really that. Imagine you're working at an office and all through the day there is the sun blaring against the blind and a little slit in the blind lets a laser beam of light shine in your eyes, and the blinds are moving a bit so the beam kind of follows you around and keeps shining in your eyes, distracting you from your work. It's reasonable to be totally distracted by that to the point where you couldn't work. But an autistic person might complain that a broken fluorescent lightbulb above them buzzing and trying to power up all day and blinking would distract them just as much, even though no one else in the office even noticed the bulb was broken. People here talk about sensory overload like it's something normal people can't understand, but it happens all the time, if I ran a jackhammer next to your desk all day then you'd be bouncing off the walls if you spent the day trying to do some work. CIA routinely use sensory overload when torturing people. Your alarm clock is sensory overload to kick your ass out of sleep in the morning."
