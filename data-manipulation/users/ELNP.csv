You're right, I do have an issue with contact sports. I would prefer that atheletes had to pay for specific sport related insurance. You can have a !delta for that. I don't think the cost is anywhere close to that of obesity though, and as I said before the health benefits will offset most if not all of the cost toethe tax payer.

Quite a lot of PT required, but that's paid for by the athelete themselves, not the state.

The cost of sports as a medical cost is far lower than obesity. It might even be negative if you account for th fact that these people are fitter and healthier than the >1/3 of americans for examble who are obese.

changemyview,ffchjlk,t1_ffblrso,1579799599.0,">That's a big assumption you've made there, most people I know play sports for lots of different reasons. Usually fitness is a side effect. Also we are not talking about people who do the required steady 30 minutes low impact exercise a day (which is optimal for health improvements) but competitive athletes. Usually competitive athletes put their bodies through such stress that it has significant negative effects. Also most competitive athletes will suffer multiple significant injuries through their sporting careers.  

Sure, but it's a pretty well known and expected side effect. Working too hard may cause problems, but the people in that category are much fewer than the 1/3 of Americans for example who are obese.

>Yes, but there are also huge amounts of risks from shattered bones, to lost organs, to cte and ongoing mental health issues. I'd say (and this is entirely anecdotal) that the athlete I know have all required far more support for health issues over a lifetime than the obese people I know. 

Some sports are more dangerous than others, that's true. In my 20 years I've been around my sport, I could count the hospital worthy injuries I've seen on my fingers.

>Yes, and for a lot of the people struggling with excessive weight there is something going ion, be it complex behaviour issues, metabolic, hormonal or other medical issues or just mental health issues because of all the fat shaming these all add up to make long term sustained weight loss a complex issue.

Then why are there so few obese people in Japan? They will have similar hormone problems, similar metabolics proplems, and comblex behavioural issues. And fat shaming is HUGE there. Companies and towns get fined if over a certain percentage of their employees are obese."

Barring accident or injury it doesn't result in more hospital funds being used. There are a plethora of health benefits to exercise, ranging from lowered blood pressure to better hormonal control. 

The same cannot be said for obesity. You can't slip up once and be fat. It takes time and there is ample oportunity to stop before you're fat, and/or reverse the process of weight gain.

Weight loss is simple. Burn more calories than you consume. That's all the understanding you need. If someone is fat and ""moderating"" their eating and not losing weight they're doing something wrong.
