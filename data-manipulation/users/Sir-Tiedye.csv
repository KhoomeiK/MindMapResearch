I just don’t know, and I don’t want to debate it.

This ones my bad but I meant to say that sadistic is an understatement, we’re in complete agreement there. I’m defending religion because across the board, almost all major religions tell people to help others and not to kill. I don’t support religion and I don’t like it either.
