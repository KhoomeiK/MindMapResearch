I know Japan doesn't share a border with the US or have an immigrant gang issue (although gangs definitely exist there), but they have also successfully prevented the growth of any kind of gun culture.

And while we have strict ownership and handling laws already in place, the number of people shot and killed by legally purchased weapons is not zero. It's hard to get starts, but the average number of murders involving licensed gun owners and licensed guns is between 10 and 12 a year - not huge, but not nothing either. The number of suicides is also significant.

Small changes, like looking further into a person's criminal and mental health history and banning weapon types that have become fashionable among mass shooters - with police making that list instead of politicians - will make things safer."

Pavelski was going over no matter what, but Stasny made it 10 times worse.

I played hockey as a kid, but as an adult it was rugby. If you saw someone going over in a lineout or tackle, you had a duty to try and protect that player and do what you could to catch them. You saw that all the time in the World Cup. You might be jamming your hand in the same guy's face a minute later if he got in your way, but there were limits and people respected them - nobody was out to injure others. I once saw a player angrily push his own player off the field for finishing a dangerous headlock tackle, and that player didn't see the field again for the rest of the game.

I know hockey is different, but I wish the NHL would take head injuries seriously. It's pretty sickening what's happening day-to-day, and the lack of respect among players. In the good old days, hitting someone in the head with a shoulder would have resulted in a goon sorting you out at the next opportunity. Bertuzzi and the instigator rule ruined that, even as the pads got even harder and made it possible to throw your body around with impunity.

It could be argued that, given the height difference, that wasn't his intent, but this is a professional athlete who has been throwing checks for a decade and he can't pretend he didn't know where his shoulder would end up.

Rush is really the gold standard of what it means to excel in something, to work so hard and do something so well that people have to sit up and take notice. Even people who weren't fans of the music had to appreciate the skill and artistry. There was talent, sure, but behind it was a work ethic that puts everyone else to shame."

canada,fdqm50z,t1_fdqkoov,1578669947.0,"I'm pretty sure the attack on a commercial airline was accidental, they thought they were shooting down a military jet. Shooting down a plane full of your own citizens isn't a show of force it's a show of incompetence.

EDIT: There's also a possibility that a radical faction within Iran that is not - or barely - under state control fired the missile to goad the west into war. It's obvious that Soleimani and his kind had a lot of autonomy in their decision making, which is how we got into this mess - he backed Iran-friendly factions in their battles with factions supported by the West, and obviously didn't care if that put them in a proxy war."

canada,fdo1ak8,t1_fdnxrio,1578597047.0,"I think having a three-year bachelor program would force people to take the professional more seriously and provide police with more opportunities for all kinds of training - while also providing more opportunities for drumming out unqualified candidates. The job pays around $100K a year, we should be picky.

There's so much to know - traffic laws, some chemistry for drug identification, First Aid, self defence, mental health and addiction studies, cultural studies, conflict resolution, the law and legal precedents, court proceedings, criminology, computers, statistics and research, interview techniques, police phrases in other dominant languages like Chinese and Punjabi, training in social services and other resources to help people, firearms training, hostage negotiation, etc. Imagine a truly professional police force where the training actually matches the salaries."

Skip the physical test, every potential president should have to pass an intelligence test, current events test, history test, government knowledge test, psychological test and stress test before entering a primary. No more stupid presidents."
canada,fdnq9dl,t1_fdnnqab,1578590791.0,"I get in this argument all the time with my mom. I can think of so many examples in BC alone - tazering a guy to death at the airport, tazering an old man in a hospital bed, shooting a homeless guy with a 2x4, shooting a guy in the back of the head, kicking a handcuffed man in the back, leaving a drunk teen girl tied up in an uncomfortable submissions position for hours, police drinking and driving and killing someone, and leaving the scene of the crime, etc. There are always going to be bad apples and cases like this, but every single time the police stick up for each other and the public has lost a lot of faith in the police to do the calm, reasonable thing.

I think most police officers are great people, but we need a more professional police force. It's a high-paid position with lots of benefits, and we should demand that all officers have some kind of bachelor's degree in policing with sessions on cultural sensitivity, indigenous communities, conflict resolution, laws and legal rights, etc. with mandatory psychological and stress testing to ensure they have the right temperament. 

Most police officers have less education in their fields than our local librarians. You can be wearing a badge and a gun after three months."
