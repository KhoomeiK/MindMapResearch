DotA2,fer4eyb,t1_feqzz3l,1579349617.0,"I agree. What I meant more was at lower mmr people don't understand very basic things like when/how to pull lanes, deny xp, when to roam etc as a support, and therefore they think supporting is a boring non active roll, and then they don't want to play it.

Definitely important to have a proper support player at all mmrs, but at least higher up more people understand what they should be doing"
DotA2,feqpt7t,t3_eqddty,1579344610.0,"Obviously different at decent mmr, but at lower ranked games an issue is that people don't know how to support. They think standing in lane and not farming is doing their job. It's obviously boring. So they don't want to do it. Simply because they are bad players and don't understand what they're doing wrong and get mad when people try to suggest what they can be doing.

Ofc these shitty angry players are the ones who want cores all the time"

A lot of issues come from many players not understanding many mechanisms and strategies in the game (easy enough, there are so many aandd if you don't play with lots of people some don't get mentioned loads).

What makes it worse is that unless people play loads their mmr will often be calibrated poorly. It takes a long time to lose mmr if you're placed too high or even more when you're below your true mmr. Properly balanced games are rare since there's usually someone way too low or high."

Bit ironic seeing as you haven't answered anyone's question.  You say something is cultural appropriation if the person doesn't understand/respect the history of whatever they are taking from another culture.  That makes sense to an extent.  Then you make it seem impossible for that to ever happen.  You just want to get mad at people.  If you want a proper discussion, maybe answer questions asked to you instead of just throwing insults and repeatedly asking the same question (even when people have responded to it).  We're trying to advance the conversation, you're just saying the same thing over and over.
