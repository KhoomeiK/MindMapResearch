nfl,fgsrgwj,t3_f055tb,1581091088.0,Can you stop posting every week please. No one wants them to move except for the greedy rich assholes who run the team. I can’t believe I see people taking billionaires side on anything.

funny,fgh4hrb,t1_fggpzf5,1580776490.0,"They are like that a lot. My fiancé told them about our dog after a complaint about their product and they refunded the item. A few weeks later we get this little 5x5 in painting that they commissioned of our dog. It was bizarre. Chewy really is odd for a massive company but I love it. I’m sure they’ll cut that stuff out in a few years. 

Oddly enough they don’t even have gift cards for sale."
