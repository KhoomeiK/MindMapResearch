Hold down the red scan button and a sort of menu pops up, tap the green monster looking thing and type in the Pokemon's name you're fighting; then it'll list all the best counters you have. I'm terrible at remembering what counters what so this makes things much easier for me."

todayilearned,ff59vxf,t1_ff57z2c,1579584653.0,"So there's between 200 and 1000 people inhabiting Antarctica depending on the season. 

Both 1 in 200 and 1 in 1000 are probably not great murder rates. It's still probably safer than those rural British towns in shows like Father Brown and Midsomer Murders though. Their murder rates are insane! I never understood why someone would stay in a town of maybe 500 people with a murder every single week! It's like they're importing murderers. It just doesn't seem natural for that many murderers to be in those small towns so often. As beautiful as those towns usually are, there's so much blood in the streets!"

kratom,fetpvly,t3_eqkmwq,1579378163.0,"I ran out of my normal online order stuff and had to track down a local head shop that sold powder. They had a larger selection than I was anticipating, but only one of the brands were actually tested for heavy metals/contaminates. The second thing that surprised me was that their price was actually reasonable. The clerk said they were on sale (don't know for how long) which put the price a little lower than my normal online orders. 

The last thing that surprised me was that the quality wasn't bad. It's good to know there's a decent local backup if my primary vendor falls through on occasion."

Several smallish jars for brush cleaning and a bigger jar to reclaim solvents. And more rags for cleaning stuff. 

A big ass drop cloth for the floor. I also keep around a bunch of old newspapers to put down so paint doesn't get on the tables or other stuff when they're drying. And more rags for when the paint inevitably will get on the tables."
kol,feczdlw,t1_fe8nneu,1578991015.0,"I do the same thing. I took a decade or so break from the game but had bought two of each of the IotM when I was playing. After I came back I sold off a bunch of older shinies to fund a handful of ones I missed that were really good. I've been able to keep up with shinies for the past two years or so though; which is nice. If I ever need a large amount of liquid meat, I can sell off some of the newer ones.

I still wish I had grabbed an extra two or three of the Kramco thing though. That son of a gun went up really fast."

Pros: I'll get that awesome backpack.

Cons: I don't get dual pistols, which is what I'd prefer over the rifle for Doc Glocktopus."

I rolled a crab spider on live, but never got it past maybe 26 or so. I guess it's time to roll another just for the backpack. Lol."

todayilearned,fdfxp88,t1_fdfuo2y,1578373103.0,One of ours does the opposite. He most frequently tears through the house when he needs to poo. Always runs straight to the litter box at maximum speed like he waited till the very last second.
kratom,fddxrxp,t1_fddxaja,1578326558.0,"I'd try both to be honest. Get a different vendor and make your doses small and work up from there. I'd start really, really small as well. Like .1 and then go up by another .1 until you get a dose that doesn't make you sick and gives you what you're looking for. 

If both, switching vendors and decreasing doses, still makes you sick, I would suggest not taking it at all. Probably not the answer you're looking for, but if I got sick every time I took it, I doubt I'd continue any use at all. 

Hopefully something works out for you though."
