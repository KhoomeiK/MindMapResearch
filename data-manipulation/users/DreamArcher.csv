If we're talking real mental illness and not just shitty people then they might have no control over how they behave so there is no reason to excuse it or not excuse it. Like some machine that grabs somebody's shirt and tears their arm off. Nobody is asking the question if the machine should be excused for it's behavior. That would be fucking idiotic. Same in the case with mentally ill. It's just the way it is and of course you have the right to remove yourself from the situation.
