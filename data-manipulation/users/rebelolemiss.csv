You also shouldn’t see wealth as a zero sum game in which one person making a dollar means another person loses a dollar. Just because someone has more doesn’t mean you have less. This is a fundamental flaw in theories such as those pushed by Marxists.

Wealth isn’t a single pie, and we continually make new pies.  John D. Rockefeller had a big piece of the oil pie, but he couldn’t have known about the solar energy pie, or the internet pie, or the smart phone pie.


This is why investment and innovation is so important, and investment and innovation not by government which stagnates growth, but by the free market. Is the free market perfect? No (so you can hold your “lasseiz faire is SOMALIA!” comments), but it’s the most successful economic system in the history of the world at creating wealth and pulling people out of poverty for all people all around the world."
