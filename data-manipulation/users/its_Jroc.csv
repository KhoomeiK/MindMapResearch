So you think looking away from your screen is totally normal gameplay? K dude. Guess I'm just ""tearing myself apart"" for calling out your cheats.

Look at his past uploads and you can find ones with his faves where everytime after a kill he'll look away from his screen at... ? Radar?  Notice even at the 0:28 and 0:29 of this video (right after his first squad wipe) he looks HARD  to the left (his radar hacks) so he can determine where the next enemies are located.

Most people dont average sprint around and only zoom on the enemies. Most people scout a little and have to find them... never elias... he sprints around till hes at the perfect angle, knocks someone, then continues moving on (because his hacks let him know he knocked the only enemy on that side of the map) notice at 0:44 where he zooms in, knocks someone, then keeps running while not even LOOKING in the direction he just knocked someone?!? 

This is just the single video I'm dissecting now. 

All of his videos are like this.

/u/eliasdavids fuck yourself with the radar hacks. Cant wait for you to get banned so EVERYONE can enjoy the game better."

PUBATTLEGROUNDS,fc3f49j,t1_fc3dmfx,1577388416.0,"""Also, I guess the best way to determine who sucks at Reddit would be some sort of karma comparison""

If you want to talk karma comparison sure. You called me a ""troglodyte"" (cave dweller) when you have more than a lifetime worth of karma points. 


Specifically my implication is you suck at persuasive arguments.

You repeatedly fail to address my points, you hurl insults when you ""think"" people are wrong, and you fail to comprehend anything being brought to you here today. You suck at this."

PUBATTLEGROUNDS,fc36ldt,t1_fc361oz,1577382698.0,"""I’m literally not reading any of your comments.""

Is this your excuse for failing to respond to any of my points? Lol whatever helps you sleep at night bud.

""You’re a child who thinks he can guilt others into being nice"" I do feel I can guilt SOME into being nice. Clearly you don't give a shit about anyone other than yourself though, thanks for making that apparent.

""A truly loathsome individual"" is this you projecting again?"
PUBATTLEGROUNDS,fc35nn4,t1_fc33vi0,1577382046.0,"""weak minded troglodytes such as yourself downvoting me because they hate that I’m right"" except you're not right. You assume we are telling you what to do when infact it's a request to be kind to strangers. A fine example how you are failing to see any side other than you're own. How stubborn are you? Fuck.

""If your mental state isn’t in a good place you should stay off PUBG, and Reddit"" thanks for the suggestion. Notice I acknowledged you made a suggestion instead of assuming you were telling me what to do.

""No matter what day of the week it is, PUBG is not a safe space for weak minded children bothered by what the calendar says."" Nice opinion dude. Definitely the opposite of a persuasive argument. 

Here's a statement of my beliefs:

I believe in your freedom of speech and right to say whatever the fuck you want. It's just when your words are hurting others I'm going to suggest you stop. I cant force you to do anything so dont worry about that.

Also you respond fast holy fuck. I respond to you 13 hours later and you instantly respond within 5mins. 56k reddit karma is hard work I take it?"
PUBATTLEGROUNDS,fc3397g,t1_fc2wbag,1577380411.0,"""Grow up, child.""  For asking you to be kind to strangers? I think any rationale person would ask YOU to grow up.

""This isn’t a safe space where your mommy tells you how special you are while she changes your diaper"" I didnt say it was a safe space. Why are you assuming what I said when you can so easily just copy paste what I said and respond to that? It seems like you enjoy manipulating the conversation by ATTEMPTING to tell me what I said while ignoring what I actually said.

""Tell me something else to do and I’ll set you straight"" Suggestions and telling somebody what to do aren't the same thing.

""Troglodyte"" you called me this word and it's used so little I had to Google it.
Here's what I found:  ""(especially in prehistoric times) a person who lived in a cave."" Is this what projection is? 56k reddit karma, yet you insult people for being what amounts to a cave dweller? How did you get 56k reddit karma my dude? Was it all the times you were outside having a good time with your friends and family?"
