Bernie is the most progressive and caring person in the field. His record supports these facts.

Warren had the opportunity to confront Bernie on a stage in front of all of America about what he supposedly 'said'. She didn't. When have you have ever known Warren to back down from a fight? It didn't happen. 
 
Before the events of the past week Warren was unabashedly my 2nd pick. Unfortunately she took on Obama advisers at some point and she's been turning towards establishment, moderate policies.
