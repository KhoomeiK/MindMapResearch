raisedbynarcissists,ff57h8h,t3_erpncn,1579582462.0,"Hey! I’m 19F part-Indian too, and I grew up there so I know exactly what it’s like. My mom is almost exactly the same as yours. Luckily my dad is better (though very formal). I’ve been in college for a year and a half and it’s a blessed escape from my mom’s craziness. She truly believes that everything is my fault and that she can never have any fault of her own. It’s terrible but at least I don’t have to deal with her. When I go home for holidays, we don’t speak to each other. It’s been years since we’ve even acknowledged each other. It’s really tough at first— I remember hating her with all my guts, especially when she made passive-aggressive, “subtle” comments about how everyone was better than me at xyz thing (even when it wasn’t true!) and of course when she was physically abusive. 

Fortunately, therapy and spending time in college away from her has done me a lot of good. I’m in a good place now; I’ve let go of all the hatred I had for her, and it’s turned into something like pity. I feel sorry for her, for her narrow and dead-end mindset, and I relish the fact that I will always be happier than her in life, and that I’m proud of the person I am. 

So all I can say at the moment is— hang in there, OP. One day you’ll be far away from her, away from her toxic self. Don’t bottle up your emotions— feel free to ruminate and introspect, even if the thoughts scare you sometimes. If you need a kindred spirit to talk to, please never hesitate to DM me. Us kids need to stick by each other. Good luck, keep your chin up, and remember you will be so happy someday soon."

There’s still plenty of time, and if you organise it into manageable chunks, I guarantee you you’ll be able to finish it off. If you want me to help you plan out your papers, let me know. I’ll be more than happy to help. :)"
depression,fem93qf,t3_epwe2q,1579244305.0,"Remember, when you need time to yourself, then take time to rejuvenate and reinvigorate yourself— but be sure that this is what you really need to feel better, and that it won’t spiral you further into a depressive episode. 

Here’s what I do when I feel like this— I curl up in a blanket, listen to music and then put in the humongous effort to contact someone who is close to me. It takes a lot to do that but they always know how to cheer me up. I don’t know if it’ll work for you but it’s worth a shot :)"

From what Iâ€™m reading, I think youâ€™re going through a lot and need professional help, at least so that they can do a better job explaining your condition than I can. Itâ€™s understandable if you donâ€™t want to tell your parents right awayâ€” in that case, I suggest going to your school counsellor (most schools have one) and listening to what they have to say. Remember, you are not a stupid teenager, and your feelings are valid. No matter what anyone else says. â™¡"
