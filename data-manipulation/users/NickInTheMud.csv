AppleWatch,ffk34e9,t1_ffji8p3,1580014339.0,"I don’t have any symptoms, it’s just that the internet (mayo clinic, Harvard) tells me it’s not the norm to have such a low resting heart rate. Mine is 53. I’m late 30s and about 15 pounds overweight. I run, but slowish. My 10K (my max distance) is around 58-60 minutes. 

It makes me wonder what my heart rate would drop to if I were an actual athlete.  I did ask my doctor about it, he said not to worry about it. 

I just keep trying to explain it to myself."
specializedtools,ffjei1b,t1_ffjdzvo,1579996566.0,Thanks. And sorry to hear you were injured.
AppleWatch,ffjdvvd,t3_etsk2r,1579996211.0,"Is it common to have a resting heart rate below 60? Mine is the same, but I’m not incredibly fit, a bit fit at best. Every time I google it, I get links saying it could be bradycardia. 

Are you a highly trained athlete OP?"

Edit: I was mistaken. The staff’s answer makes no mention of James actually driving.
