1) Literally everything a white person does
2) Non-stereotypical things a person of color does.

I hope that helps."

AmItheAsshole,ff9lhgs,t1_ff9dt6a,1579715502.0,Dad wouldn't trade his crusty old nickle for two bright shiny pennies and think he came out ahead.
TumblrInAction,ff58m82,t3_erkpyo,1579583483.0,"I always see them claiming centerists say this, but I have yet to see them provide evidence of that."
facepalm,ff3n6a6,t1_ff2747m,1579544632.0,Results may vary. Actual must smell not guaranteed.

shittymobilegameads,fecmrsv,t3_eo9e7t,1578977785.0,I played this game and there is absolutely no pregnancy or baby. Why are there so many crappy game ads using a woman having a baby after her man cheats as their hook?
AskReddit,fe6jc23,t3_enpz15,1578892756.0,"I went into the ER a little over a year ago with severe pain in my lower back. After getting some initial scans, a medical professional asked me, ""Wait, so when did you break your rib?"" 

And I was all, ""Uhh... I don't think I did?"" 

""Well, the scans show that your 9th rib is definitely broken. Actually, it looks like it was broken, it healed, and then it broke again.""

""That's... weird. I mean, I know I'm clumsy and I've definitely had a few spills recently but I can't think of anything strong enough to break a rib.""

Turns out that I had a cancerous tumor growing out of my rib that weakened the bone to the point where it broke twice. Now whenever people say, ""If you broke a bone, you'd know,"" I laugh uncomfortably."

stevenuniverse,fdenwh3,t3_ekvie5,1578342976.0,3edgy5me theory time: Connie actually died after the movie and Steven hasn't accepted it yet and deluded himself into believing she's just not around because she's getting ready for college. But then the whole series was a coma dream anyway so it doesn't matter.
