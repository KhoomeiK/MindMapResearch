StandUpComedy,fg8ircu,t1_fg6rtnc,1580620769.0,"this has nothing to do with transgender people.  Most transgender people don't give a crap about shit like that.  My comment was directed toward Weak cancerous energy vampires who exist to make the left look weak.  The reason your shit yourself about the wrong pronoun is because you're a Weak person.

If you were a straight white heterosexual male, you'd be a WEAK straight white heterosexual male.  


See the thing you don't understand about gay people or trans people or black people or white people or asian people or ANY kind of people is that \*\*Words\*\* have NO POWER OVER THEM.  

believe it or not, gay people and trans people are actually Very Strong.  They don't fall to their knees and shit their pants and scream ""Nooooooo!!!"" every time something doesn't go there way, or wear pussy hats and get epileptic seizures whenever they hear a bad word.   Or break down and cry over the fact that a group of people used applause instead of Jazz hands.  
why?   because only narcissistic vampiric attention seeking  WEAKLINGS do that.

the reason you're a piece of shit isn't because you're transgender.

You're a piece of shit because you're a piece of shit.   You and people like you exist for one purpose and one purpose only.   To make trans people look bad.  To make them look like over emotional crazy people.  To make them look like clowns and a joke.  Why?  maybe you get a rush out of it.  I don't know why.  
you just ENJOY making gay people and trans people look weak."
StandUpComedy,fg5x1mw,t1_ffzuq30,1580542535.0,"and you exist to destroy the left.  and to give right wing conservatives power.

You're like that angry retard on the opposing team who kicks balls into their own net.    I mean you exist for the sole purpose of making liberalism and progressive ideology absolute Shit for Everyone.  I mean that is the ONLY reason why you were born.  To make sure good people lose.  And to make sure people on the right get more and more powerful until eventually they win.

I mean that's ALL you do.  You're a Cancer that just EATS into the left until it Dies."
PoliticalVideo,fg5wocd,t3_ewupj6,1580542061.0,"I think that a video like this is proof that the far left only exists to Absolutely DESTROY the left, and to make sure that people like Sanders lose.   Personally I think the far left is the best thing to ever happen to white supremacists and right wing conservatives.  
It's like having an angry retarded guy on the opposing team that kicks balls into his own net."
JoeLycett,ffzv44q,t3_evmuml,1580393696.0,it's happened to an entire generation.  They're called millenials.
JoeLycett,ffzu9y4,t3_evnaye,1580393050.0,They're not in Iran i heard.
StandUpComedy,ffzsbh2,t1_ffxvevd,1580391473.0,no one gives a fuck about people like you anymore.  Especially LGBTQ and trans people.  they HATE people like you.  we all do.
StandUpComedy,ffz2w9r,t3_euhuvz,1580362191.0,"but  \*\*WHY\*\*  can't the far left retard clowns take him down?  why are they losing their power?  I mean even the right no longer acknowledge these mentally insane shit for brain mutants as members of the left or of liberalism.  And people on the right are some of the dumbest morons there are.  
so the question is What changed?  why are these people losing all their power?  why are people(especially LGBTQ and people of colour) standing up to these narcissistic human failures and calling them out for being the Massive subhuman fakes that they are? 

I think the last straw occurred when they started calling Latin people LatinX

and turned the LGBTQ movement into a scrabble game played by a dyslexic schizophrenic in a lunatic asylum.    
I'm actually surprised that black people didn't beat the shit out of these gross pale cancerphages for getting ""offended"" on their behalf.    


Can we as a society (right, left, male, female, gay, straight, bisexual, queer, trans, white, black, brown, asian, and whatever in between)  PLEEEEEASE come together  and set these people on fire?  PLEASE.  let's just set them on fire.  I'm not a violent person but Just in this rare rare case/occasion, let's set them on fire.    I mean i'm not being racist because they're not a race.  They're like a cancer right? a grotesque subhuman cancer."
StandUpComedy,ffpl044,t3_euhuvz,1580097624.0,why is so hard for the far left to bring him down?  it's like no one gives a shit about them anymore.

GetMotivated,ffkomwt,t1_ffkmvl3,1580026224.0,"  There was a poem.  And it served as a warning to this.  I can't remember who the author was  but it was called The Hatred.  I kinda kept it as a warning and I read it once in a while as a reminder to why we should always strive to be better people.  I hope you hang onto it too and I hope it inspires you to be a good person.

**THE HATRED**

The wolves were so many, and I watched as the other lambs began to flee. 

But I was slow, and soon I began to fall from the flock.

Yet she did not abandon me.

Falling through the ranks, she ran to my side;

Urging me, pulling at my ear with her aged teeth.

Like me she was old, but she did not give up.

Please, you must run faster.

'I cannot', I replied. 'I no longer have the strength.

Leave me! You must! Save yourself.'

I begged her. But she did not listen.

Struggling, we moved through the unforgiving night.

The wind, blinding us with an onslaught of ice-rain and snow.

Yet the wolves continued their hunt. And soon they were upon us.

I tried to protect her. I tried. But I was only a lamb.

So I screamed, as my flesh was torn apart by their sharp, piercing claws.

And I watched as they tore into her body, tasting her blood in celebration.

Again I screamed so they would hear me, 

Yet I could not bring them away from her.

So horrible it was, as they feasted on her heart, 

Desecrating her remains with their feces and urine.

And after they marked that territory around her, 

I watched them move away, satisfied by their fill.

My sight diminishing, I stared into her cold dark eyes.

Wondering where our shepherd was.

I cursed his name!

We followed his laws! Worshiped his being!

Yet in our hour of need, he abandoned us.

  

So as my body fell numb to the cold, 

I could no longer feel the pain.

I felt tired, peaceful, comforted by the sound of distant thunder.

But the sound grew stronger, 

and soon I was blinded by the lights of a large machine.

Slowly the sound died down. 

And as the lights diminished, I regained my weakened sight.

At that moment I saw the shepherd. 

His long white beard flailing in the wind.

Emotionless, he stepped out and knelt beside me.

His warm, aged hand touching my head.

He spoke to me in a soft, familiar voice. 

By then, I no longer cared.

Saddened, he stood up and walked away, 

As the wolves howled and insulted his state.

Some of them snarled, readying the attack.

But the shepherd did not bother.

Slowly he moved behind the machine and flung open its guarded doors.

And from within the unknown spectre, 

Came the vision of which we had only heard in legend.

For as my eyes grew wide with fear, 

I bore witness to the shepherd’s first creation.

For there stood forth, The Hatred.

Its eyes red like the tools of the butcher.

Its teeth like tempered steel.

Blackened blades protruded from its spine. 

Its entire skin covered in shadow.

And I knew the fate of those who came upon it.

For there stood forth, The Hatred.

They said it came to be long ago.

Long before the sheep dogs came to birth.

Long before a rebel few ran with the wolves.

They said it was built in the factory.

And unlike the others, it had no soul.

Slowly, it moved in their direction.

But it did not matter, for they ran.

They ran as if the Apocalypse were behind them.

They ran with extinction in their wake.

And I peered into the night, as the wolves became the hunted.

And I saw as it began to run.

So as I lay there, I cried once more.

Not for myself or the one who fell before me.

For on that day as my heart fell silent,

Instead I cried for them."
GetMotivated,ffkmvl3,t3_ettlvw,1580025377.0," When I was young. There was a big loud neighborhood dog. It was vicious and i feared it. And I told my dad this. And you know what? He never taught me to be strong or to be brave.  
he gave me BAD advice. he told me to fall into my fear. to descend into it completely. To make the dog bigger and badder and to give it 3 heads and blood covered teeth. He told me that whatever fear I had for that dog to multiply it ten times more.  
And going against my better judgment I did. And then it happened. and he saw it. and he asked me. What was that? what was THAT emotion. was it fear?  


and I said no. and he said Tell me. tell me what you feel.  
and i said ""anger. i feel anger.""  
and he said yes. Fear is like the dust and the dirt and the grime and the sand and the rock of a nebula. You don't clean it away with bravery or strength. You let it get thicker, and bigger, and heavier, until it all collapses in and falls in on its self. And then, like the Phoenix born from the ashes... at the APEX of fear, Anger arises. It comes into place like a sun. But when you transmute that anger, and you focus it, and intensify it, that anger turns into hatred. and through that hatred you gain strength. and through the strength of hatred, your chains are broken. and by embracing death, you gain dominion over life. Because all life fears death. and by your will and by your actions you become death.  


My dad would quote Friedrich Nietzsche and he would say  
""Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into the abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you.""  


He said ""do you know what that quote means?""  
and i said ""yes. it means that we shouldn't fight monsters. Because if we do that long enough we'll become just like them.""  


and he said ""No.""  
Son what that quote REALLY means is that you must become the abyss. you must Become Abysmal. Because there's nothing that monsters fear more.. even more than the archangels themselves, than falling into the abyss.  
so i asked him ""dad but Why. if the abyss gazes back into you, why would you gaze long into the abyss?""  
and he looked me right in the eye and said ""Because THAT'S how you shave in the morning. and brush your teeth at night.""  


I asked him what the last part lead to and he just ignored me and looked at me confused. and he dismissed me like i was a waste of time. But I asked him again. if the apex of fear is anger. and your focus of anger leads to hatred. then what happens when you get consumed by hatred?  


he never answered.  
A wise man once said ""You will not be punished for your anger.  You will be punished BY your anger.""

embrace love. Be a MAN. don't become the abyss. because if you take that path, you're only gonna end up like this.. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMVlU7MKXQg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMVlU7MKXQg&fbclid=IwAR0x_WWCsvkV3iFwZIDzgE0h99fFd3MedfRpaC0UpLsGzlqyvNbn6EmRwWc)

Because as MEN it is our duty to stand on the right hand of God. never to be the left.  


it's the stoic heart. no passion, only peace. no ignorance, only wisdom. no chaos, only harmony. no self. only god."
TwoXChromosomes,ffbl5lv,t3_esi0c4,1579770653.0,"it's like Yin and Yang.   to be honest, I wish religious conservatives were for abortion and liberals were against it.  It would make more sense.    Poison the water, destroy the environment, start illegal proxy wars, Yaaay!!  Kill babies? NEVERRR!!!

I used to think that people who killed babies and napalmed villages were evil.  But maybe it's just a sort of blanking system in the brain.   Similar to people who could cut a pig's head off, cook it in an oven, and eat it with family in one hand, and then pet a dog with the other.

In truth it's not your fault.  If we were living in the time of the romans, your kids could come up to you and say ""mommy can we Pleeeeeease go watch christians being fed to the Lions!!""

and you would say ""sure but only if you eat your vegetables.""

Most people aren't evil.  They're just a product of their conditioning.  Many of you could abort a child 8 and a half months into your pregnancy and go enjoy a sandwich with your friends the next day.  And at the same time, a doctor could pull it's brains and guts out of your body without blinking an eye.  Are you evil? nope.  Is the doctor evil? nope.   You're just a product of your conditioning.    


in the same way, most of you could go to a grocery store and purchase the body parts of a dead animal, wrap it in spices, toss it in an oven, and then put it in your mouth.   If you were living in another country, you could throw a homosexual off a building for being homosexual.  Or throw rocks at a woman for committing adultery.  Are you evil?  nope.  Just a product of your conditioning.  To see beyond conditioning is like asking a blind man to imagine colour.  

In fact, most people reading this will either downvote it immediately OR scratch their heads in total confusion and go ""what the hell is this guy ranting about?!""   and then go on to watch some sort of football game or cars going really really fast in a circle.

If you were living in the 1900's and your toddler were teething, you would give him cocaine.  Today, you could give a child a candy bar or an ice cream cone without blinking an eye.  And nobody liberal or conservative would look at you like you were insane   Even Though sugar activates the same neural connections that cocaine does And is just as addictive.   Don't believe me? go without sugar for 2 weeks and see what you experience.   crazy world huh?"
