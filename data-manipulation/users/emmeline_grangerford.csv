It’s not an employer’s job to serve as surrogate parent. If I meet up with a stranger on my lunch break, my employer can’t fire me because of “concerns for my safety”. That’s a good thing, because some people don’t see a distinction between adult women and children who need to be supervised. On the other hand, my employer can fire me for arranging outside contact with a client I met on the job.

blogsnark,fdc6gun,t1_fdc2ayn,1578268039.0,"I feel like writing the book was probably helpful to Chung in sorting her thoughts, and it makes sense that her thinking has evolved since her memoir was published. Her parents’ attitudes around transracial adoption (emphasizing colorblindness, assimilation, and being “chosen”) were pretty mainstream in the 80s, and the parents later supported Nicole’s search for her biological family and decision to write a book that painted her upbringing in a complex light. They sent Nicole to a therapist to help her with her anxiety after she was bullied, which is a healthy choice for conservative Catholics. The adopted parents weren’t perfect, but I got the impression that they tried to be responsive to Nicole’s needs, despite a limited capacity to understand what she was going through and how best to help."
blogsnark,fdbz13v,t1_fdbtnta,1578264050.0,"When you have a chance to read it, please post your thoughts! I think it will appeal to you if you enjoy fiction more than non-fiction. The book is a straight memoir, which might disappoint readers who prefer nonfiction presented in a historical or sociological context. The writing is not particularly philosophical, and I can see how readers would feel that certain aspects of Chung’s experience are unexplored or oversimplified. Chung makes one particular choice that is likely to inspire strong reactions - either sympathetic or appalled."
blogsnark,fdbpy0q,t3_ekfu46,1578260117.0,"This weekend I finished *All You Can Ever Know*, by Nicole Chung, and really liked it. Chung is of Korean background, and was adopted as an infant by white parents. Throughout her childhood, Chung believed that her biological parents relinquished custody because of her premature birth and associated medical needs. As an adult, she learned that the circumstances around her adoption were much more complicated. The story is surprising, and Chung’s writing is thoughtful and well-balanced. 

Today I finished “The Witch Elm”, by Tana French. I enjoy her writing style - she’s got a gift for vivid description, and is good at writing in character. It was nice to see her break away from the murder squad format, as the last few books in that series have been a bit boring. With that said, The Witch Elm didn’t feel like a huge departure from French’s other books. There are a few tropes she’s revisited more than once, and the story required some suspension of disbelief (not as much as “The Likeness”, but it was close). It’s worthwhile reading for French fans, but not the best book for a reader unfamiliar with her work."

blogsnark,fczma50,t1_fczd383,1578104322.0,"If it helps at all to hear, I didn’t read that particular post as critical of you, but as pointing out a key reason your situation is different than that of the Kushner brothers’. You clarified that you were talking about the feeling of being judged by family background, rather than your own merits. However, you’ve earned a graduate degree and established a career in journalism without having anything handed to you. The Kushner brothers have had everything handed to them, and their family fortune is based on exploiting other people. They still depend on family connections to make money. To an outsider looking in, your situation seems very different - like, not even comparable. I can understand that you can relate to feeling judged on background, though."

In all seriousness, it is noticeable that Amber’s comment threads are overwhelmingly snark-free, compared to discussions of anybody else. I hadn’t considered paid shills, but thought that perhaps Amber’s fans congregate here because (I assume) she gets trashed beyond reason at GOMI."

blogsnark,fcohl2p,t1_fcnv5gj,1577832406.0,"I read Busy’s memoir a few days ago, and their friendship made a lot more sense: Busy has a big personality and can be exhausting, but she has quite a few long-term friends and to me that reflects well on her. If she were a complete asshole, I don’t think she would maintain friendships for very long.

Busy describes meeting Michelle when they were thrown together on the set of Dawson’s Creek, in fairly isolated circumstances. The show filmed in a remote beach town, and Michelle wasn’t close to anyone in the cast before Busy came along. Busy was new, and wanted a friend. It sounded like a friendship that formed because they happened into each other’s lives at the right time. 

I’m not a huge fan of Busy’s, but bought her book to read on a plane and found it pretty good, as far as “celebrity” memoirs go. Her friendship with Michelle Williams is pretty much the most fascinating thing about her, though."
blogsnark,fcm3je6,t1_fclt783,1577763304.0,"This was so much fun to read - you are spot on! The 1994 version captured the March family’s austere circumstances and panic about money. Their meals and clothing were very plain. The house had a worn-down, wabisabi atmosphere that suggested why Louisa May Alcott referred to the real Orchard House as “Apple Slump”. The house in the most recent version is sumptuously appointed, and their celebratory breakfast was big enough to feed an army. I watched the movie with my mother, who wondered aloud why the sisters didn’t have a donut each before sharing breakfast with the Hummels. 

Laura Dern definitely came across as a warm and laidback Marmee. She was straight out of Malibu, not New England. There was a mealy-mouthed lack of spine in the way she asked the girls to give up their breakfast, as if they were the ones in charge. Susan Sarandon’s version of Marmee seemed like she could and would cut a bitch if any of the girls stepped too far out of line, and I believed her as a person who struggled for decades to control her temper. Laura could probably have captured that quality if she’d been directed differently. Greta Gerwig seemed nervous about allowing any of the characters to be unlikeable aside from Chalamet, who was irredeemable. The actors who played John Brooke and Professor Bhaer were good finds."

blogsnark,fclosuk,t1_fclak0r,1577752837.0,"I completely agree about Timothée - he's very handsome, but brought nothing of interest to the role. Christian Bale zeroed in on Laurie's desire to be part of the March family in any capacity (according to the director's commentary on the 1994 version, Bale wasn't familiar with the source material and only read the script), which worked really well - he was charming, creepy, and seemed utterly enamored with the sisters. Chalamet's Laurie was an annoying little twerp, and it would have been satisfying to watch Florence snap his character in half and pick her teeth with his bones. (In a metaphorical sense, she did - I was shocked Laurie had the balls to pursue Amy after she told him off in spectacular fashion so many times.) 

I would love it if Florence could be edited into the 1994 version in place of Samantha Mathis, who was such an anemic Amy. Reese Witherspoon was considered for the role, and she would have been an excellent choice. Winona Ryder was a producer and had some say in casting, and I expect she didn't want an Amy who would outshine Jo - a real risk if Reese were cast. I can't fault Winona too much, though - apparently Trini Alvarado and Christian Bale were her suggestions. She wanted it to be her movie, and she was nominated for an Oscar, so her instincts paid off. 

As long as I'm geeking out - what did you think of Laura Dern as Marmee? I thought she initially came across a bit too modern, but her performance grew on me as the movie went on."
blogsnark,fcl62og,t1_fckdqv8,1577740596.0,"I loved Florence as older Amy, but wish they had cast a younger actress to play Amy as a child. Florence is really talented, but she isn’t childlike. This gave Amy’s youthful antics a disconcerting element: Florence came across as a deranged adult, not a little girl. 

In fairness to Florence, Kirsten Dunst’s portrayal of young Amy is a hard act to follow, especially because Kirsten was the same age as the character. I might feel differently about Florence’s performance if I hadn’t seen Kirsten’s first."
