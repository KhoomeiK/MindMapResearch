tortoise,ff6nq9q,t3_ery003,1579631104.0,My Hermann's has a warm bath (not too hot) every month or so. I have a small tub (30cm ×10cm approx) which I fill up to about his chin when he's standing up (to encourage him to drink). I add some calcium dust and use a small measuring cup to pour water over his head and shell. I then get cotton buds to scrub of the dirt around his neck and legs. After about 10 minutes I dry him on his own small towel and let him walk around for a while
