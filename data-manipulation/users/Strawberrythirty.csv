Parenting,ffi8t0a,t1_ffi12sb,1579968039.0,Mothers probably do have this difficulty but they overcome it extremely quickly because they have no freakin choice lol. No one is going to come over and bail them out like women do to their husbands. They don't get as much sympathy or excuses as men get.
Parenting,ffi8imx,t1_ffh9bwv,1579967836.0,"My husband used to be like this almost exactly. It took several full blown arguements and a few calm talks throughout the span of a LONG time (because men are dense af lol) until he finally understood that just because he worked and i didnt, didnt mean he could come home and pretend he was still a single child-less bachelor.  Or else what the heck is the point of making a family guys?

I gave him an ultimatum and was willing to die on that hill, that he could only retreat to his man cave and play video games once the BOTH of us were done with our parenting duties. He was not allowed to retreat when it was PARENTING TIME. And parenting time was for both of us when kids were awake. After they were asleep, it was his time and he could stay up as late as he wanted as long as he got enough sleep for work the next day. He slowly got the hang of it and dare i say, actually enjoys it now. He sits and watches tv with the kids, plays on the floor with them, takes them out to the park, cooks for us, talks to them, brushes their teeth, helps with hw etc. He's even learned to style our daughters hair and invented special things that i would have never thought of called ""projector movie nights"" where he sets up our projector screen, moves the sofas out of the way, gets popcorn and we look like we have a mini theater in our livingroom. The kids LOVE movie nights. And his gaming has taken a back burner because real men have to grow up eventually and don't let nonsense like obsessively gaming run their lives. I'm actually appalled he comes home so early around 4pm and doesnt lift a finger for you two until bedtime. I would never tolerate that. My beast of a husband comes home at 8-9 most nights and dives right into where he can help me. Either tucking them in and helping them sleep or brushing teeth etc.

The kids now have things that they only want daddy to do ""daddy does this better!"" Point being, you got to put your foot down momma...it wont change if you keep treating it like its ok. You and that baby girl deserve better and let him know it."

I have an 8 year old boy who got a nintendo switch this year and immediately installed a game called Fortnite on it. I don't know much about it but apparently you can add friends to it and i had no idea until the other day when i go to the bedroom and he goes ""i can hear my teammates talking with their headsets"" I asked them if they were friends from his school and he goes ""no, i dont know who they are...."" ""so they might be adults your hearing?"" ""yeah maybe..."" I was horrified...i then told him to delete anyone he added that arent his immediate friends from school. He got annoyed but understood. I have no doubt he wants to make ""online friends"" because he thinks its cool, and its so easy to do ya know? Much easier than making real life friends. My best advice is i think your 14 year old should be more involved in school? Like have her take afterschool activities where she can make more real life friends? That way to her it will seem more fun to talk to her friends than total strangers. Also i would definitely monitor her things in case a predator reaches out to her.
