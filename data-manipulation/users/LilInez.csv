My sincerest condolences, I can't even imagine the sorrow you must feel.
On the other hand I'm so relieved your found your kitty. She looks like my darling Miu so I'm feeling the feels doubly. Take care!"
cats,fdxmn71,t3_en69wh,1578770634.0,"I have no advice. I lost my cat to lung cancer. Her death was horrible due to the vet. She suffered immensely in her last moments. 
I still see the scene in my head and it's been at least seven years. I've felt guilty for a long time but I did all I could. 
Before her last day my cat had a wonderful life and was very much loved and spoiled. After her death she was greatly mourned, by my parents and myself and by her best friend, Teddy the orange tabby. He brought mice to her grave for three days.
I can't say anything that will lessen your grief. It guts you. I can only say that you are allowed to grieve in any way you need or want for your cat. I'm now remembering my Kato and am crying both for her and for your cat. I can share my tears, I can tell you I understand how you feel. That's all I can do. 
I'm a very sensitive person, especially when it comes to my pets. Don't let anyone tell you you're being silly. There are lots of people here who would feel exactly as you are feeling right now.
My sincerest condolences.
