NetflixBestOf,ff82nhf,t3_erz9l3,1579664378.0,"I liked Coven (S3) a lot, they had the vocalist of Fleetwood Mac as a guest star, and the whole season was really campy and kinda funny. I also liked Apocalypse, they incorporated many characters from past seasons, but most significantly from S1 & S3. Apocalypse was very campy too, and I liked it. But a lot of people hates the particular seasons I liked, so I’m not sure if you’ll find it pleasant or not :/"
