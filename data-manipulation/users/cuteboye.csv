TrueOffMyChest,ffbjfa5,t3_eshpm5,1579768127.0,"A girl in middle school was good friend with the girl I had a crush on.

I think everybody knew, even tho I never told anybody.

One day out of the blue my crushs friend came to me and asked me if I like her friend. I didn't say anything, because it happend so fast and I were kinda buffled first.

She then proceeded to tell me that I wouldn't have a chance anyway and went away."

Stoicism,ff95gn8,t1_ff9474v,1579705293.0,"To start overall I would recommend Marcus Aurelius Mediations.

Nietzsche didn't like Stoicism and in his books he's more focused on ""good"" and ""evil"" and human nature, but you'll find some pretty good lessons in any of his works. 

> Where to start 

There is no guide. :) Just hop on Google and read about what certain book is about. You can start with Nietzsche, Socrates or Aurelius, it doesn't matter. 

Marcus Aurelius was against ""reading too much"" and wanted to force himself on actually implementing what he learned into his daily life. 

Also I would recommend to mediate about 5 to 10 minutes a day, helps to keep a clear mind ;)"
