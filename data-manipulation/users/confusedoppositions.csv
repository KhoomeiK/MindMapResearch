ForeverAlone,ff6kpcs,t1_ff6h6r8,1579629266.0,"Idk, I feel like it's impossible to make friends. I barely talk with anyone, I'm not included in any social activities whatsoever and I already have zero friends so I won't meet new friends through already existing ones. I tried to socialize but it just doesn't work... I have experienced nearly nothing in my life so I lack stories to tell, I'm not super funny but eh, I can occasionally make people laugh. I can't join clubs because I know I'll be a loner even there, I tried it thrice but people just stick to the ones they already know. I'm bad at sports so I can't play ball sports and meet some teammates, I even tried this and remained as a joke. What I have is just empathy, people come to me, cry, and go. I'm a top choice in sorrow and forgotten in all kinds of joy. I get left behind in birthdays, group excursions. I even tried to invite myself, all I get is ""next time"" and when that next time comes I just get ""OH I FORGOT""... Yeah you can't forget the same faces that went with you before, you also added new faces but is it coincidental that I'm always the one that gets forgotten? This happened like 20 times and I'm not exaggerating, and with the same person. It's just intentional. And nearly all people I know have been friends since childhood/early teenagehood, that's why I concluded that age makes it harder to make friends, nothing else. My situation is getting worse because now I feel unwanted, which means I will always remain in a shell, no more self inviting or trying to ""force"" interactions. 18 might be the perfect age to make friends for someone who has good qualities and already has friends (even a little bit), not someone like me. I'm in a phase where I want to accept my situation as a fact, I guess knowing my limits will make me set realistic expectations from people, I mean expecting nothing."

depression,ff0lmdx,t1_ff0hun9,1579470039.0,"You're the perfect daughter anyone could ask for. You stayed true to what your mom said and you're doing it the right way. He must know that being in a relationship with him isn't a rebellion over all rules your mom sets and that no matter how long you stay together there are some red lines which shouldn't be crossed, and the most important one is your family and what rules they set for you (as long as you're okay with them). Trust me, you're too good for him, if it was someone else he'd see how loyal to your family you are and how you stick to your promises and actually admire these traits in you, but he is just after getting physical contact, and it wouldn't surprise me if he'd cheat to get it. This one isn't a keeper, end it and learn from the experience. A breakup, especially in your situation, doesn't mean that you're wrong or that you aren't good enough because we all know how shitty he's acting so don't project the failure of the relationship on yourself and be proud of the fact that you didn't betray your mom's trust."
depression,ff040xl,t1_ff01nmx,1579464943.0,"so wait, he thought he's more important than your mom? he clearly is overestimating his spot and isn't caring about what you think and how you feel. Leave it here, end the relationship and try to move on. Trust me it's not your mistake and to be honest it's rare to find a first boyfriend that's just the ideal match for you.

ForeverAlone,feybsqt,t1_fep2qwq,1579443420.0,"according to your comment you undervalue friendship or view it as a relationship with the purpose of finding someone to kill time with, nothing else. Texting doesn't make good friends, doing sports can make you more sociable but in the end if you limit friendship to casual meetings and low level of checking on your friend becaus that sounds like something you'd do with a partner then imo, you're missing the point of friendship. Anything you do with a partner can be done with a friend except sexual stuff, so if there's love between friends it isn't built on physical attraction that'll eventually fade away, making it a stronger relationship than romantic ones."

depression,fesyset,t1_fesjjks,1579370253.0,"I completely understand your state, if the relationship ends I assume you'd probably start blaming yourself for not giving him what he wants but trust me, he must understand that you have your own comfort zone and he must respect it. The problem is, you came across the same issue more than once so he doesn't seem to get you fully, otherwise it wouldn't have repeated. Just ask for a meeting, sit down and explain things calmly. Communication imo is a key for your situation because it will definitely make things clear for him, and if I have to make a guess, he thinks that you have something to hide about the whole subject which might make him want to end the relationship. Put a limit to eveything, shut down his false interpretations and keep the relationship going. also, are you his first girlfriend? if the answer is yes, it might explain his ""thirst"" may I say for having sex."

ForeverAlone,feo9e61,t3_eq1k3c,1579296881.0,"Wanna hear a story?

Well I'm 18 and struggling with the same issue. I want a best friend more than a girlfriend because imo, true bestfriendship can't be shaken easily. I met someone I considered as my best friend last year, I started acting stupid around him, so did he, he shared lots of secrets, we got too close... I as a person am generous af and would do anything for the people I love, so I went too far for him, I'd do him unnecessary favours he has never asked for. I knew all the time that I wasn't his best friend but I was fine with that. Until, someday he started ignoring me for reasons I didn't know, later on I heard from a mutual friend that he thinks I have a crush on him due to how gentle I was but that's who I am, his friendship was the only meaningful relationship I had in my life so I tried my best to keep him comfortable around me which seemed to him like flirting or impressing, idk why. I thought everything is built on a misunderstanding so I broke the ice and talked, yet he told me to get over him and refused to reply to any question I asked saying that he doesn't want to make the problem grow bigger, yet he finds it fine to tell others about the issue.

I'm hurt bad, and do not want a best friend, I'd rather live isolated completely than with humans because I distrust everyone since then, so what's worse than not having a best friend is getting betrayed by who you considered a best friend. Enjoy your life as it is because dealing with shit people cause is tougher than loneliness itself."
depression,fed5fo9,t3_eogx53,1578999777.0,"I kinda believe that it's not too important, I think it depends on how the person is attached to his sexual desires/ how sexual the person is."
ForeverAlone,fe6o552,t1_fe6ebdr,1578897778.0,the joke snowballed and became a problem. the issue might be in me for taking it seriously but I guess you can't blame a 4/5 Y.O for thinking like that.

depression,fe1juyw,t1_fdyxuqr,1578827455.0,"she's probably a person that values romantic partners over anything else which is a common thing these days. To me everyone has his special spot that can't be touched, a super close friend is equally important as a romantic partner, you can't ditch one for the other or pick one over the other. I loved my former best friend, I love my family members but everything is in it's own way."
ForeverAlone,fe1j1r3,t1_fe0iscx,1578827079.0,"it's fucked up honestly. if you care for your friends you're gay, if you act inconsiderate you're fine.
and I guess you meant what kind of world do YOU live in* because there are better places where it's rare to find this kind of retarded thinking."
ForeverAlone,fe1ikbs,t1_fe0mfle,1578826852.0,"idc about it tbh, but in this super homophobic retarded society I live in (definitely nowhere near you, our society's thinking is based on religious beliefs and offers males the superior dominant role and expects all males to be that tough buffed guy with a deep masculine voice and a large moustache, anything less than that doesn't work) so you'll get heavily  abused for stupid reasons that don't make you less of a man in any other country. Sometimes being tolerant and open-minded in a super conservative and predefined society is a massive problem."
ForeverAlone,fe0hgrt,t1_fdyx8xo,1578813503.0,"and yeah I don't fight back, I just ignore any bullying until they get tired of it and stop it."
ForeverAlone,fe0h4dw,t1_fdyx8xo,1578813355.0,"omg that was a typo. I meant 6'3 but you know, missclicked 2 and 3 in the same time. Will edit it"
depression,fdy8kkx,t1_fdy6ht6,1578777201.0,"some people like to get a lot from others and give a little and tbh almost everyone I met views friends as people to kill time with/to gain benefits from, only a few will love and care for a friend (talking about brotherly love which exists imo and is as strong as any other bond between people).
have you tried reaching out and talking? she might be thinking that you're ignoring her, and you are thinking that she forgot about you. you can't know what's going inside someone's mind without communication. for my case I've been misunderstood, mistreated and still I broke the ice only to get rejected again."
depression,fdla2pq,t1_fdl9jed,1578519648.0,imo the name sounds better when it's just one word yet I can't think of a name that hasn't been taken :(

AskAstrologers,fdjshp6,t1_fdi9sio,1578485889.0,"oh yeah I've been told that I need to find a balance between the 2. for me, I'm super secretive, probably because scorpio is my dominant sign and leo isn't even top 3 so scorpio traits overwhelm leo?"
AskAstrologers,fdi04s3,t1_fdhveq8,1578433344.0,tbh I never tell my secrets to anyone no matter how close they are. and actually I'm not social at all so I have no close persons...
AskAstrologers,fdhzzko,t1_fdhveq8,1578433263.0,didn't get what you meant by that scorpio rising+leo moon secret thingy. does it mean that I'm super secretive or the opposite completely?
AskAstrologers,fdhzpsr,t1_fdhveq8,1578433120.0,"forgot to mention that my dominant element is water and my top 3 dominant signs are scorpio, sags and cancer so there's a lot of water in me."

self,fd49cph,t1_fd420qv,1578165551.0,I'm not funny tbh but I can make people laugh if I want to. the jokes I make that get people to laugh are about myself.
self,fd4156v,t1_fd3ybke,1578163447.0,"actually I'm pretty tall, in shape, I don't look bad so for the physical appearance I don't fall too short and according to school I'm smart. for being clingy/careless, I never treat a person carelessly. I'm known for being very helpful and for going a bit too far for people who don't even know me that well and I'm also a good listener that's why I'm always one of the frist persons who get contacted when someone is in trouble. I get clingy only when I feel like someone I care for is losing interest in me so you can say I'm not clingy. idk what's wrong lol"

depression,fdla2pq,t1_fdl9jed,1578519648.0,imo the name sounds better when it's just one word yet I can't think of a name that hasn't been taken :(
depression,fdl9w8p,t1_fdl9jed,1578519541.0,that's what I thought because there's no way that it somehow remains unused.
depression,fdl8xrs,t3_elwq1m,1578519054.0,steady sounds like a catchy name
AskAstrologers,fdjshp6,t1_fdi9sio,1578485889.0,"oh yeah I've been told that I need to find a balance between the 2. for me, I'm super secretive, probably because scorpio is my dominant sign and leo isn't even top 3 so scorpio traits overwhelm leo?"
AskAstrologers,fdi04s3,t1_fdhveq8,1578433344.0,tbh I never tell my secrets to anyone no matter how close they are. and actually I'm not social at all so I have no close persons...
AskAstrologers,fdhzzko,t1_fdhveq8,1578433263.0,didn't get what you meant by that scorpio rising+leo moon secret thingy. does it mean that I'm super secretive or the opposite completely?
AskAstrologers,fdhzpsr,t1_fdhveq8,1578433120.0,"forgot to mention that my dominant element is water and my top 3 dominant signs are scorpio, sags and cancer so there's a lot of water in me."
self,fd4lpsq,t1_fd402z4,1578168731.0,I've been through a terrible experience lately that's pushing me away from people even farther
self,fd49cph,t1_fd420qv,1578165551.0,I'm not funny tbh but I can make people laugh if I want to. the jokes I make that get people to laugh are about myself.
self,fd4156v,t1_fd3ybke,1578163447.0,"actually I'm pretty tall, in shape, I don't look bad so for the physical appearance I don't fall too short and according to school I'm smart. for being clingy/careless, I never treat a person carelessly. I'm known for being very helpful and for going a bit too far for people who don't even know me that well and I'm also a good listener that's why I'm always one of the frist persons who get contacted when someone is in trouble. I get clingy only when I feel like someone I care for is losing interest in me so you can say I'm not clingy. idk what's wrong lol"
AskAstrologers,fcauumr,t1_fc9a0gq,1577577060.0,"I know my house placements and transits but idk what they mean and I'm quite new into astrology, knew a few months ago that there's a moon sign etc at first I thought it's all about sun sign..."
