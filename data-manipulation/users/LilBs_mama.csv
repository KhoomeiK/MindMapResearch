beyondthebump,fdzr016,t3_engvta,1578793804.0,We had 2 pack n plays with either removable or reversible changing tables on them. We kept the smaller one (which was also on wheels) downstairs. Totally worth it

sleep,fd91jzl,t3_ekbecc,1578226867.0,"I agree that it is probably nothing to worry about. In different cycles of sleep, the body's thermoregulation doesn't do as great a job as when awake."

Get all excited about that possibility (which of course will never happen). Watch their face change when they realize they'll need to disappoint you with an answer of no. There's a very good chance that the individual won't ask the question again, especially if others are around to hear the conversation. 

Or, like one of the early comments said, it may all just be what they think is innocuous chit-chat that you can entertain if you feel like it. But if it feels intrusive, is uncomfortable for you, and doesn't stop, there's nothing wrong with returning a little discomfort in the conversation to make it stop."
