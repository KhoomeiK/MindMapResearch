Simply put - why does this dungeon exist?  Who built it?  Why did they build it?

Why, instead of making one or two very serious, hard to get through doors, did they build a 25 room maze using puzzles and riddles to unlock it?

If you can think up GOOD reasons for this to exist - who built it, how did they build it, what did they build it with, to what ends did they build it - then you can start working on what riddles and puzzles would exist there.  The riddles would presumably have some meaning to the builders, the puzzles would be either something they would know how to get through without having to memorize, or would be used to test the diligence or intelligence of those moving through it.   Maybe it’s meant to keep evil creatures from gaining a powerful artifact that the godly folks would need, as the builders saw in a vision, to face a future threat that would destroy a god, a city, a world, a plane.

If the players have a REASON to be in this place, and can learn WHY it even exists, they might enjoy it a lot more and feel more immersed.

On the other hand, people can go their whole lives without changing - again, by resisting it or not even acknowledging THEY need to change - instead blaming things on other people.  “SHE wasn’t showing me enough affection, so I cheated,” rather than “She wasn’t showing me enough affection, so I had a conversation with her about it” or “so I broke up with her when I realized it wasn’t going to change.”

d100,fenqrxl,t3_eowuds,1579289459.0,"-Xenophobic Manipulation
Dwarven ore is disappearing, elven magical items stolen seemingly right under their noses, human livestock and occasionally even babies are taken, gnomish gems and some mechanical devices go missing.  Racial distrust runs rampant.  Dwarves blame elves, elves blame humans, gnomes blame dwarves, humans blame everyone.  The only race anyone still fully trusts are the halflings.  Sick of the lack of respect, halflings are following a charismatic leader to reclaim their place in the world.  Using stealth, their innocence, and subterfuge, they are pitting the races against eachother, while stockpiling all manner of things.

-The Heart of Dominus
The nearby dwelling of gnomes, which the city trades with regularly for some necessary goods, stop communications.  They don’t show up to trade, they don’t respond to any attempts to contact them.  No one can seem to find any of the entrances to their underground home - even those who had been there before.  The party eventually finds their way in, to find crazed, half-starved gnomes, who ignore the party completely.  The entire group is feverishly working on something, which the party discovers is a huge mechanical construct, that looks VERY fit for battle.  It begins to awaken.  At the heart of this mystery is an ancient artifact that is sentient, holding dominion over the gnomes to build an immense instrument of destruction.

-The Grand Vernal Hunt and the Fey Festival
People keep disappearing while in the woods.  Lone travelers, whole wagon trains.  Legends speak of 1000 years ago, a similar occurrence took place.  Only this time, a lot more people are disappearing.  While investigating, the party gets taken too.  They learn it is time for the Fey Festival, a huge celebration.  However, someone is abducting people to sell as entertaining trinkets to all buyers.  Once he is stopped, the party returns home to find people still being abducted.  Back in the Feywild, they find
that every 1000 years, in Springtime, Oberon the Green Lord has a Grand Hunt, abducting all manner of mortals.  Now they must either defeat Oberon in a seemingly impossible challenge, or convince Titania to persuade him on their behalf to release the prey.  Perhaps by offering some new kind of dangerous prey...

-Madame Cure-Me
A fantastical new metal/ore is found.  All across the world, demonstrations are going up and their stock is selling out quickly.  Apparently found in ample supply, and very cheap to extract and fashion into devices, it can be sold at such a price that even most peasants can afford it.  Quite beautiful, but also functioning to light up and even play a very calm, tinkling music type of sound, it becomes en vogue to all the nobles, and is appearing in virtually all centers of civilization.   A month or two later, people are reporting all manner of horrible sicknesses, disfigurement, pain, weakness, skin slouching off, babies born with deformities.  It turns out the material is similar to being highly radioactive, and cure disease doesn’t work as it technically isn’t a disease.  At the center of this is a company that knows full well what its products can do.  The party must race to defeat the corporation, find the cure - first for themselves, then for the remaining population.  Also must convince the different cities to remove the offending material, a task which isn’t so easy."
d100,fenisxs,t3_eowuds,1579285603.0,"—[Evil Underdark devotees to a Blind Goddess use magic to engineer a disease to affect surface-dwellers with blindness.  Party races to defeat them before Underdark races come together for massive assault on surface.]

Humanoids begin becoming blind.  95% of everyone falls to this “disease.”  Huge groups of the population end up nearly helpless, slowly starving, dehydrating, falling ill due to touching filthy things before eating what they can find, or being killed by beasts they can’t see around them.  

The party, including either a pc or npc who was blind from birth (as such is not at a disadvantage) must follow the trail, which leads into the Underdark, where a group of mages or clerics has magically “engineered” a disease to blind the surface folk.  Magical darkness enshrouds the area of their enclave, where the devotees all have blinded themselves in devotion to their goddess.  

The villains are in the process of rallying evil Underdark races for a massive assault on the surface.  The party must either kill all the messengers sent out to the other races, or destroy the magical epicenter of the city, before the other Underdark races begin their assault in whatever timeframe the DM wants to use.


—[Powerful druids meld into ancient trees in their groves to control all manner of non-magical animals, using them to attempt to wipe out civilization.  Each Druid has a powerful artifact the party finds upon their death and must banish safely somehow to stop the attacks.]

Friendly animals begin attacking people.  Over the course of three months, it goes from odd accounts of pets, farm animals, and birds attacking people, to people being attacked, eaten, carried off by larger creatures, mobbed by large numbers of birds, many times a day.  Even fishermen in boats are being attacked by fish jumping out of the water.  Magical beasts seem altogether unaffected.

If encountered, powerful beings such as dragons are even freaked out by this.  Unused to huge, swarming attacks, that seem to come on a more and more regular basis, from ants and bees to huge beasts like elephants, very few unaffected creatures remain safe.  

The party connects the dots to an unnaturally large collection of druids they hear about, which have taken over an area protected by an unusually large number of beasts.  In animal form, they manage to get inside this circle of defense.  At the center is a grove of ancient trees, inside of each is a powerful Druid who has merged his life with that of the tree.  Their plan is to cleanse the land of civilization and destructive powers in the world, to reestablish the natural order.  Each Druid that does has a powerful artifact controlling different kinds of animals that must be cast into pocket dimensions to break the charm.


—[Powerful aliens are terraforming a world, and stealing from inhabited planets to do so.  Home world of party is losing water - goes through whirlpool and a portal to alien world.  They must find a way to defeat or reason with the alien Officials in charge of the terraforming to save their homeworld, and the other worlds.]

It stops raining.  It takes awhile to notice, but more and more reports of crops failing come in.  Wells are drying up.  Mountains streams stop feeding rivers.   Rivers dry up.  More land appears at the coastlines.  Cities require powerful elementists to produce enough water for the people.  

While traveling across a sea, on an unrelated or related quest, the party finds an immense whirlpool from which they cannot escape.  The ship is supplied with potions of water breathing, maybe a ring and an amulet for more permanent water breathing, and the entire boat gets sucked into it.   They get pulled through a portal, surrounded by water, and upon surfacing find themselves on a strange new world.  

A strange alien species is here, using magic to terraform this world.  They are unaware that their Magics are stealing from other, populated worlds.   First, the party must find out where each portal leads to, as they are stealing air from one world, land from another world, water from their world, and even plants from one world and animals from another.  Then, they must prioritize which ones need saving in which order (such as first air, then water, then land, etc) as there is a different alien Official in charge of each part of the terraforming process.  They could of course kill the Official, but this would bring the wrath of more of the alien species.  The preferred method would be convincing the alien to stop stealing from that world.  This could be accomplished by alerting them to Elemental planes, or uninhabited worlds to steal from, or perhaps the party finding ultra-powerful artifacts to give to the Officials.  Upon completing in a friendly manner, the aliens can send them home.  If completed in a hostile manner, guess who has a new world to play in for a long time until they can find a way home...

— Mechanical creatures large and small begin attacking major cities.  Mere annoyances at first, the attacks become more frequent and more effective as they wear down the cities.  At the heart of the issue is thousands of tinker gnomes, enslaved by a powerful dragon with psionic powers, living in a strange mechanical monstrosity that protects it and the gnomes that serve it.

— Only in major urban areas, gold keeps turning into copper.  The gold is verified as gold, and every night, it becomes copper.  Inflation occurs, and the trust in institutions begins to fail.  People losing life savings begin committing suicide.   The party finds leprechauns underneath the cities, with powers much like pixies, and must find a way to deal with the unruly creatures.  Killing them is exceedingly difficult, and reasoning with them is maddening.
