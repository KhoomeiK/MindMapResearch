# What is Meme Economy?

r/MemeEconomy is a subreddit meant for the discussion of memes, and their current, and future popularity. /r/MemeEconomy allows posts discussing new templates and examples of how those templates could be used. We look for versatility and aim for templates to be used in a variety of ways. 

***MEME ECONOMY ALLOWS MEMES FROM OTHER SUBREDDITS, AS LONG AS IT HAS NOT BEEN POSTED TO /r/MemeEconomy BEFORE*** 

# If this subreddit is meant for templates, why do so many people post normal memes?

As long as OP links their template in the comments, the post is allowed. The same goes for if a template is posted; there **must** be an example meme linked if OP posts a template.

This is a way for us to ensure quality control and make sure that meme templates are able to be used in other ways other than the original.

# How do I link my template/example?

There are several ways that you can link your templates and examples, the most convenient being either posting on another subreddit and linking to the post from there or posting to Imgur and copying the link.

When a user posts, they are PMed a message about the requirements and the ways to link their template/example.

If you see a user link their template or example in the comments, please upvote the comment even if you don't like it, it makes it significantly easier for other users to access it and use it themselves!

In the future, we plan to include functionality to make it so the OP must post a template/example for the post to show up in /new, and that template/example will be automatically stickied on the top comment. 

# How do I start investing?

Investing on /r/MemeEconomy is currently disabled, but is coming back soon^tm . We are aiming for a release in the next couple of weeks, and are getting ready to start closed beta testing (not open to new testers).   

# Why was my post removed?

There are a variety of reasons why posts are removed, either manually or by the automoderator.

* **Reposts:** This should be a relatively obvious one. If someone posts a meme that has been posted on the subreddit for discussion before, we often remove them. We strongly favor Original Content, as do the majority of our subscribers, and reserve the right to remove posts, and ban users who simply come to this subreddit to cross-post content from other subreddits. 
*  **Titles:** We use automoderator to manage which posts have titles that are relevant to the economy, and any post that doesn't fit those requirements will be removed. Contact us by modmail if you believe your title uses economic terms but was removed anyway, and we will approve your post, and fix the algorithm for the future. 
* **Not linking a template/example:** Moderators reserve the right to potentially remove your post for not providing a template/example. 
* **Old templates:** As stated above, we are here to share new templates that have not been seen before on this subreddit. 
* **Not being relevant to Meme Economy:** Generally, when a post is removed for this reason, it is because it doesn't involve a meme template. Posts like this include Snapchat and Tik Tok screenshots, Twitter posts, and other posts falling under this category. If there is no other viable use for the template other than the one OP has provided, it may also be removed for this reason.

We're not saying this is unwholesome! Just that sub's focus is uplifting, unless nicing-up existing rude memes. There are already great subs for cute (/r/aww, /r/eyebleach, /r/rarepuppers), things that make us smile (/r/MadeMeSmile, /r/HumansBeingBros, /r/AnimalsBeingBros), or that give us the feels (/r/WholesomeFeels or /r/baww).

It's not a ""no"" - it's a ""not the best fit here,"" and another sub will be better.
