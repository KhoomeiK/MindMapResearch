Ich umfahre etwas, sonst ich fahre ich etwas um.

Warum das im zweiten Fall trennbar ist und im ersten nicht, hängt vermutlich damit zusammen, dass es einmal um den Vorgang des Umfahrens geht und einmal um das Fahren, bei dem man etwas umstößt. Hauptsächlich wird es aber historisch gewachsen sein."

I guess as long as you pass all the skill checks it is smooth sailing. But i had a streak of bad luck and failed skill checks with a chance of > 50% several times in a row.

Once you messed it up with one faction, there's no way back. And that includes the side quests even when the quest givers don't attack you.

I would not consider it a glitch, but this should be handled better. And quite frankly, i don't like ""kill-on-sight"" mechanic at all. I would prefer that this would work like the holographic disguise running out of time - you get one or two skill checks and then get attacked.

comicbooks,fdf9hzi,t1_fdbck4z,1578356443.0,"Well, X-men had two runs in Germany before the 90s. One was the original series, published around 1970 by ""Hit Comics"" sometimes titled ""X-Menschen"" (because at the time heroes got german names, like Flash was ""Blitzmann"") reprinting Roy Thomas/Werner Roth stories in black and white single issues with a Hulk (""Halk"") backup story.

The other one was in the 80s by Condor Verlag in a small paperback format of around 90 pages titled ""Die Gruppe X"" reprinting the Claremont/Cockrum/Byrne X-men.

Both suffer from rather unpleasing formats and type set text instead of hand lettering.

But you might be interested in these [https://www.comics.org/issue/649727/](https://www.comics.org/issue/649727/) (again ""Die Gruppe X"") starting with #154 (Claremont/Cockrum) or [https://www.comics.org/series/38280/](https://www.comics.org/series/38280/) (""Die neuen X-men"") which started with X-men #177 (Claremont/Romita Jr.) and used a more regular 32 page A4 format.

After that there was a longer gap until new comics were published. And i lost interest because i had started buying the american originals.

As to where to get them, i can't tell you. But Germany does have specialized comic shops and maybe you can find back issues there. I couldn't find a list online, but you can just google ""comic shop"" and your area and should find something."
comicbooks,fdahumc,t1_fd9a6os,1578246251.0,"That rating system wasn't made for me. I don't care about cut out coupons. I'm used to it.

German Superman comics of the 70s and 80s had a bonus system. Every book had a coupon printed in a corner of a comic page. Send in a bunch of those and you got a poster (of the Batcave or a dynamic Neal Adams Batman or a life size Flash, etc.). I had several of them.

Pretty much 50% of all those books are missing the corner of a page.

In case anyone is curious here's a german thread about them with some pictures.
