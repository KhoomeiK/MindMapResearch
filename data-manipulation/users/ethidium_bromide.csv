Dogtraining,ffnwz7l,t1_ffmfy8o,1580071819.0,"OP, your dog is playing you.
Aussies are smart as hell. Some common training guidelines that work for most dogs, work different for dogs like yours (and mine)

Just one example, but things like redirection are often rewarding the wrong behavior (for smart dogs) unintentionally

You keep talking about trying different things but then say it doesn’t work bc dog reacted by biting or being loud. You are almost certainly prematurely choosing some approaches as wrong. For the same reasons as not giving in to a child throwing a temper tantrum, you can NOT give up when it reaches this point! Your dog is going to test you. It is NOT going to be happy with what you’re setting as the boundary. As long as it thinks that reisisting *might* give what it wants, it will keep resisting. Every time you may have caved is being used against you right now in your dogs learning. 

Every time he acts out, look at it like “what does he want right now?” and give it the opposite. It’s the longer and more complicated partner of positive reinforcement."

If they do not like each other at first, keep them in separate rooms. But not with the door closed. Use a gate so they can see and smell each other. Put things that smell like the puppy, such as blankets/towels, in with the older dog. 

Make sure to give the older dog lots of love and attention. Puppy’s obviously require more attention than older dogs for their day to day, but you want to make sure the older dog receives the same amount of attention to prevent jealousy or feeling replaced.

Remember for your older dog, this is his territory, his home. The puppy is practically an intruder in his mind. Obviously different dogs react differently. Your older pup may have none of these issues with the pup. Still, you should try to make their first direct interactions in “neutral” territory, such as on walks.

Put in some work building positive associations with the play pen just like you would crate training(lots of info on this if you bing “crate training”

As far as energy, walks aren’t enough for many breeds especially walks that short. My dog is absolutely mental if he doesn’t get free running in addition to walks. Note: not safe going on runs with humans when this young though. Mental stimulation is also an important factor in how much energy a dog has. 

Regarding the house training, lots of positive reinforcement when the pup does go outside, using high value treat such as chicken, and using a phrase like “go potty”. 

A few other recommendations I’ve seen is to basically not allow the pup free reign until after they are housebroken. Crate train pup and bring straight outside from crate. Keep pup tethered to/near you so you can tell when it is about to go."
