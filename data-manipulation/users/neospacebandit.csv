I’ve been working with pin oak and cottonwood and they both stiiiink when they’re wet, but after they’ve been turned and have dried out for a few months the smell has gone away completely."

space,fdccudw,t3_ekcg0e,1578271808.0,"I’d posit that intelligence is an evolutionary mistake on a universal scale and that the most successful life forms are simple organisms that can most easily adapt to changing environmental conditions (plants and bacteria predated us by billions of years and will remain billions of years after we  are extinct, and make up the majority of earth’s biomass). As such, while the odds of life in an infinite universe would be nearly infinite, the odds of intelligent life surviving long enough to develop technology to interact with other planets before creating a mass extinction event that effectively wipes them out (see, humans) is nearly zero."
worldpolitics,fczgtf1,t3_ejf00t,1578100936.0,"Here’s my armchair analysis: 
- The latest release of emails had moderate gop senators quietly talking about actually removing Trump from office. 
- Word gets to Trump, he thinks to himself (or some moron advisor suggests), “they can’t get rid of me in the middle of a war.” Asks what assets are on the ground, gets intel that this Irani guy who everyone has ALWAYS hated is in target, how about him? 
- Trump acts without thinking things through, and advisors don’t give him useful advice , pulls himself into a war without full public support because of the preemptive strikes. It’s insanely cynical to say this, but if trump really wanted a distracting war to keep him in office, and there really was a planned attack, he’d have been better off letting the attack happen and then responding from a defensive position. He’d have a legit fight and full backing from congress and the public and it would probably have delivered him the 2020 election."
