At 40 attack, you can get the brine sabre, which I like better, but that‚Äôs me. 

Easy quests will give you the most enjoyable leveling-up experience, as most of them are designed like tutorials, and give big exp rewards for useful skills. (Theyre all on the wiki)

Not to mention that juicy lore..."
2007scape,ff8mpog,t3_es6pq4,1579686224.0,"Definitely go members ASAP. Even if you haven‚Äôt maxed out all the f2p content, playing on members servers gives you MANY advantages that make the f2p quests MUCH easier/quicker (such as teleport tabs and more potion options) 

All quests have super easy guides to follow on the wiki, that give you all the information on every aspect of the quests, as well as recommended gear and supplies to bring. 

Once you go members, do the waterfall quest. It‚Äôs easy and you get HELLA starting exp. 

After that, maybe the quests to unlock skills and teleports. A list of all those in order of difficulty should be readily available from a quick google search.

This was my strategy and I‚Äôve been playing every day for like 7+ hours for two weeks, without a moment of boredom. 

Lastly, look into buying Old School Bonds on the Runescape website. 
They will benefit you, the game, and most importantly, the devs."

What's the quickest way to level up defense? I've done the waterfall quest, but other than that, I don't know the quests that reward for defense. Is mobbing the way to go? The grind isn't a problem for me.

I also have quite a bit of gp, so expense isn't an issue; just the quickest way possible.

todayilearned,fdutyh1,t1_fdusgfg,1578738787.0,"The most expensive part is labor. The pvc is bought in bulk for cheap, and most manufacturers offer ‚Äùregrind‚Äù material (messed up records that we grind back down) for a cheaper cost. But huge labels don‚Äôt want that, because they are convinced the quality is lower. Also, they expect a blended color or an etched job for the same price as basic black, not taking into account the extra batches of material we have to buy just to mix that blend (we can only order single colors) or the extra money it costs to have the stamper companies laser etch an image on a side. 

As for quantity in an order. These machines costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, and take an enormous amount of electricity, steam, and oil, and take at least two payed workers to make the record from start to finish. So we simply just can‚Äôt accept orders for 200 anymore, after we‚Äôve geared up to fill orders of 100,000 or more.  It‚Äôs not about making it worth their while, it‚Äôs about making a profit.
