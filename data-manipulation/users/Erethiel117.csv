NSFW_GIF,fezzemu,t1_feotryd,1579463517.0,"I just don’t understand the things people do for money. I’m all for anal, but give me actors that are into it."

Unexpected,fecmxvp,t1_fe91cjp,1578977917.0,All it took was a slight wallet nudge for Epstein’s guards to say fuck it. Don’t look to America’s criminal justice system for sensible laws and officers of integrity. The hypocrisy and corruption is insane. Justice in the USA is dead.
WTF,fecm1os,t1_fe6i3n8,1578977255.0,"Had a chainsaw jerk into my knee while trying to cut a tree out of a barbed wire fence. Didn’t even notice it had hit me until I moved onto the next tree and my sock started squelching because of the blood. 

Those tools aren’t a joke"
dankmemes,fecjn0w,t1_fe95f8j,1578975524.0,Think of how stupid the average person is. Now step back and realize that half of them are stupider than that.
ihadastroke,feci483,t1_fe7f5hx,1578974466.0,Wait. Am I dyslexic? I saw this and immediately knew what it said.

dankmemes,fe9u0yd,t1_fe5r1xi,1578941411.0,The pain/pleasure complex is incredibly complicated when aroused. I wouldn’t be surprised if hot sauce ticked the box for some people.
confidentlyincorrect,fe48omk,t1_fe1f92x,1578856848.0,"This is why I’m a firm believer in taking a second to think out what you’re going to say. No one is rushing you, and it’s better to come out clear and concise."

Unexpected,fdqulj0,t1_fdpczwx,1578675146.0,"They’re also more likely to get fed by humans than attacked. I’d bet they were following their stomachs when they hung around. 
On that note, bread is bad for ducks. Don’t feed them bread."

worldnews,fdfs3al,t1_fddq70e,1578368825.0,"It’s all just playing to the media. If you think that Iran isn’t playing to the media as hard as our politicians are then you’re a damn fool. And everything else aside, trump is still the president. I get that he’s crass and an asshole, but he’s still the president. I’ll believe actions more than their words. Words are just tools to manipulate."

politics,fda56j9,t1_fd3vofa,1578241815.0,"Nope. Churches are in the business of saving people. That’s still a business. Churches and the NFL should all be paying taxes and the fact they’re not is absolutely ludicrous to me. 

Why raise taxes when you could just start taxing some of the biggest corporations in the country?"
politics,fda3ri9,t1_fd7ebbw,1578241344.0,"It’s a pretty shitty figure of speech. The presidents children won’t fight in a war regardless of how much money they have. Too much of a security risk. 
Focus less on your hate speech and more on how the world actually works."
politics,fda363p,t1_fd7569v,1578241088.0,The security risk alone is significant enough to not send the children of our president (regardless of who it is) to war.

atheism,fczbcze,t1_fcz4ypw,1578097494.0,Well I think it’s clever. I love wordplay like that. One of the best points of learning another language for me is being able to pick out simple jokes like that in normal conversation.

apexlegends,fcrfxil,t1_fcp5f3c,1577901302.0,"I had a game earlier in the week with a buddy I’ve been gaming with for a decade. Our third was at work so we LFG’d and picked up a god. I swear all we did was run from the storm. Landed as far away from the circle as possible and this dude as a wattson was traveling faster than my pathfinder. I don’t even see anyone till endgame and all I’ve been doing is getting shot trying to follow this guy into the fray. We get 2nd. My buddy and I got a total of maybe 400 damage and this dude put up an 1.8K game with 9 kills. It was insane and I never want him on my team again. Give me a decent teammate, not a solo god."
nextfuckinglevel,fcrej8g,t1_fcqd6yd,1577900762.0,Yeah. Newest CoD drove that one home. Waves upon waves of drones with explosive payloads. Shits terrifying.

PoliticalHumor,fc6r17a,t1_fc6p8ig,1577487288.0,"Pretty easy to form an opinion to vote when you’re retired. 
I think it’s just as harmful for people to go out and make uninformed votes, and a lot of the youth today are so swamped with work and/or school that it makes sense to not vote."
