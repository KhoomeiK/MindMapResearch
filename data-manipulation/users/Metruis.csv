But, once you're old enough you can leave home and cut ties with your parents who are awful.

You probably do have depression but a therapist won't fix it immediately, they just help you. They might help for you, and they might not. You might find you get better as soon as you're away from your toxic family. Kind of like how someone gets sick in a house full of mould. So don't give up on yourself just yet. Right now you're reflecting all of their toxic behaviors and it's normal to feel like there's no hope when you're in that. Bullies work by depriving you of hope, the most basic human necessity of all. But you are old enough to post on Reddit, you're old enough to begin planning your escape. Maybe you'll join a carnival. Maybe you'll join a fishing resort. Maybe you'll join a cruise ship. Maybe you become a nanny. Maybe you go to a farm. The goal is to get a starter job that comes with board, so that, even if it's a summer job, you're away from your family and can start building a platform for yourself.

Sometimes the best family is the ones you make for yourself, like your boyfriend and best friend. You can surround yourself by people like them as soon as you leave your home. Be strong. I know it hurts a ton, and it makes sense that you're suffering. You're living in hard mode right now."

SuicideWatch,felm0ac,t3_epszcq,1579225377.0,"This is not worth killing yourself over. This is literally normal teen drama and teen dreams. It's worth being sad and eating too much ice cream over and sleeping for 12-14 hours because you just don't want to exist for a while. Everyone's heart gets broken a few times at your age. Endure it and you get stronger.

Right now it feels huge because your brain is growing and flooded with hormones, that will ease up when you get into your early mid twenties. I used to cry every day at your age. Life was pain. Love was pain. I have only one friend I had at your age who's still my friend, an online friend I now know in person, I had to be stubborn with her so don't give up on your friend, keep reaching out. But for the most part, it's normal to make new friends after high school.

Anyway, your boyfriend can hug whoever he likes, you don't own him. And he's talking about the future which you still have if you don't kill yourself, so obviously he's still into you and doesn't view hugging someone as an end to your relationship.

Really there's no fix for teen pain other than ""endure"", your brain literally just wants to kill you right now because it's flooded with hormones to grow it to its full size. It sucks, it hurts, and it's not worth dying over. Any teen suicide is a huge tragedy because many of them would have levelled out in their twenties and become regular adults. Not all, since many adults are depressed too, but you can't know that unless you try living through it. Like I don't know a single teen that wasn't depressed and hurting when I was a teen. And most of us have normal lives now even if I'm not their friend anymore. We might use weed or drink or smoke to get by but we're making it work. I still swivel into depression but I don't cry constantly anymore.

Cry if you gotta, draw violent art, and work on your education if it goes badly. Tons of time for heartbreak later. And time to make new friends too!

You're paying for time, not a product. If an agreement was made and you are unsatisfied you can end the agreement but you still have to pay for time spent otherwise yes, they can drag you through the muck like this. Collections will try anything to get the money owed. Change your number or suck it up.

This is too vague for me to judge and as a freelancer my instinct is to say ""they think your family is the scam artists"".

She probably just sees you as a good friend and loves you as a friend or she's in the closet even to herself, only time will tell, so be her friend, friend love is powerful and valuable too and only time could turn it into something else.

As for your parents, they seem volatile so tell them when it's safe. Your dad just might be mad at the idea you're having sex this young so keep your budding sexual thoughts to yourself and trusted persons for your safety.

Friendship is great. It might not be the best possible outcome in your mind, but you'll value a solid best friend by your side and find another cute person who also loves you back in the right way later if you want. There's room in your life to have both huggable friends and future romance so be happy she is warming up to you and experiencing love with you, even platonically, because it is a special thing to share that with another human and maybe even more rare than romantic love. You have the potential to have a best buddy. Cherish that opportunity even if it doesn't lead to sex. Not all joy in life is sex related. Sex is fun but my best friend is my world. I met her at 14 when she was 17. I value what we have very much, even if it's not a lesbian relationship. I did have one of those for a year, it didn't work out... but if a girl is attracted to you, you'll know. Probably. Unless they work themselves into the same anxious wreck as you do in their head and hide it. You never know for sure, so chin up, your heart isn't totally broken yet, you're just hurting because one potential has possibly dried up.

Embrace it and ignore them. Call on adults to back you up, his music was great even if he's a complicated figure.

I bet you're being relentlessly teased not ""bullied"", I have trouble imagining you're being held in a toilet for liking the wrong music, if so you gotta talk to authority figures in your school because shit is out of control. If they're just verbally taunting you it's not bullying, just crank your music up and ignore. Yes ignore, ignore, do not respond, literally just pretend these people don't exist, shove past them and say nothing to them in return to be used as ammunition. Except for maybe facts of how successful he was with his music.

Advice,fe61u3k,t3_enwvel,1578879890.0,"Well, you already have professional help, you're just not taking advantage of them, so I'm gonna say your parents are right. You're depressed and anxious and you'll get through it on your own. Medication isn't a magic quick fix. Neither is therapy. But plot twist: teenager brains are flooded with hormones because they're still growing and developing, making everything you feel 5000% worse. Your family knows this, even if they didn't tell you exactly that, and you just have to endure the emotional agony caused by your growing brain until in the mid twenties it finally stops. You'll become harder then, and learning will be more challenging, but you'll suffer a bit less once it cools off. I can't promise it'll become easy and you might still find you benefit from therapy or medication. I took antidepressants and they helped a bit. I didn't start them until mid twenties and got them from a general practitioner.

I feel like there's no point to you going to therapy if you don't trust them enough to talk about your actual issues though, you might as well just have an online friend for that. Better to see a doctor who could give you anti anxiety medication. I used that maybe 100 times, I didn't need it often but it helped a ton, I no longer use it, if you have panic attacks I recommend asking a doctor if they can prescribe something that will calm you down rapidly in the moment. The pill I got for it was close to as good as my asthma medication for how much it helped my anxiety."

I only have one friend from then, I met her online when I was 14, both of my earlier ""best friends"" actively cut it off from me, so if you don't stay friends don't feel bad.

SuicideWatch,fe0v0wv,t3_enk77b,1578819020.0,"I agree it's for the best. You're in an unstable place and shouldn't have weapons until you level out for everyone's sake.

They're an ex for a reason. Even if it hurts. Trillions of humans have endured heart break and you will too. The only good reason for suicide is if you were a murderer or an offending pedophile. You're just sad and lonely because your ex left you or you left them and now your life is different, that is more of a cue to hack off your hair while sobbing, eat an entire bucket of ice cream, get drunk, and move to a new area of the city so you don't bump into the same places and take up a new self improving hobby to meet new people and invest your pain and anger into like, a workout routine or something. Working out until you hurt is the best self harm because the secret is, you hurt yourself and make yourself suffer and get stronger along the way.

Fuck them for hurting you. Now go find someone who deserves you and respects you and loves you without strings. If you killed yourself over it you'd be letting them win and prove only that you can't live without them. The best way to win is to prove you can thrive without them and maybe you're even better off without them and their bad habits dragging you down.

Break ups always make me want to die for like at least a month or two, so be patient with yourself as you heal from the wound they left on your heart. Whatever reasons brought them to date you, those positive things are still inside the ugly sobbing wreck, and someone who loves you will see those things about you again. You have a chance for future love even if it hurts like hell now. Maybe you won't want it for ages but you owe it to the awesome person on the inside who initially attracted a date to recover and free them to search again if they, y'know, ever find themselves open for love again."
SuicideWatch,fe0s6hg,t3_enk7dk,1578818043.0,"It's just her expressing her own challenges suicide. Don't read too much into it other than ""she still has complicated thoughts surrounding suicide and maybe still thinks about it and only gets by day by day by telling herself she's been given what she can handle."" This is why depressed people aren't always best to help each other out, because what happened here is, you basically just took on some of her emotional weight when you wanted to offload yours and now you're carrying a horrible thought that's likely lived in her mind for ages for her to say it so easily. You're probably a feelings oriented person and it's easy for you to take in someone's thought and raise it as your own. You don't have to carry it though. It's her thought. Don't nurse it until it becomes an inescapable part of your depression. Try imagine putting it in a box and then getting rid of that box.

Anyway natural selection isn't preacher bullshit it's evolution bullshit all mixed together, and irrelevant because killing yourself isn't natural and depression comes from your brain being sick. Your brain chemicals are at fault, not you for ""not being able to handle it"", life is really hard as a teenager and young adult for many reasons which complicates the inside of your head and amplifies how hard these feelings hit. Your feelings don't have to be the same as hers. You don't have to keep it there. It hurts you too, so you shouldn't, let that just be ""I know my friend has this dark thought"" and not cultivated until you can't tell the difference. The fact is, a lot of thought loops people get come from other humans.

So far though, life has given you what you can handle even if it's been on hard mode endurance run style for a while. You've made it to your 20s. Keep hacking at it. Who knows how it'll go. I can't promise it's going to improve but for me it did, and my depression is much easier to handle now. It no longer drives me to self harm. I never went to therapists either, just got an anti depressant. Though I don't discourage if you think it would help. They've helped some of my friends a lot.

Good luck, and thanks for sharing your pain with strangers."
