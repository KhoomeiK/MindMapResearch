WinStupidPrizes,ffgg7mi,t1_ffgdwpj,1579905519.0,"So you just make wild assumptions and become hyperbolic in your discussion? And yes. When you brandish a gun in a school, it is a serious crime. You should get punished for committing a serious crime. The ""It's just a prank bro!"" argument doesn't work. Especially if you are a grown adult. We are not talking about a kid here. I don't know what the punishment is for his crime, so I won't speculate on whether or not it is fair, however, he absolutely deserves to be arrested and punished accordingly.

His accent was just so bad and added nothing at all to the story, character, or anything really.

People who face up against Vader seem to usually be calculating their moves extremely carefully. Like a boxer who takes a few slow speed test jabs against his opponent, or a chess-match where they are both doing a ton of calculations in their head to try and anticipate their enemy. I hate that the Obi-Wan/Vader fight in ANH gets so much hate. That's exactly how it should look IMO. The prequel fights are all style and no substance, and they just flip around a lot and do really stupidly impractical stuff. It literally is only cool because it looks flashy."
