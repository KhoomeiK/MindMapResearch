That's great.  Is there any chore your wife dislikes, that you can do for her and make her life easier?  Also throw in a foot massage coupon as an extra if the flowers are a no-no.

That's to show that you appreciate her and are willing to make the first moves to put you on a good footing.

The underlying issue here though is that your wife feels that she is doing most of the responsible stuff and the decision-making.  This may or may not be true but this is what she currently perceives and it is making her feel resentful.  There may have been some other smaller episodes, which could also be leading to this - things you may not even have thought of or she could be suffering from added work stress? - just speculating.

 I am like your wife, I often make the decisions and sometimes when this happens the other person feels they can abdicate responsibility.  This comment, *""Baby, I don't know. I think that whatever you decide is the best decision. You know what's best""* would drive me nuts, especially after I have been working for two hours on the computer, while you've been vegetating.  Your initial response of cash and daycare benefits would have frustrated me because you were not thinking it through, you were just answering.  I can understand you were tired, but she would take it as well so was she yet she still continued to work because that's what she needs to do.

About the tattoo, was there a reason that she needed to call the tattoo parlor?  Was there an expiration date etc?  Again she is saying, she has to take action to get things going, you're just prepared to let things slide.

This is just my view because I can relate to someone like your wife.   The fact that you raised your voice and got angry and she went silent, is to some degree a good thing, because it tells me yelling at each other is not the way you engage with each other.  I think the time since, has given both of you time to cool off - in a way she's also aware that you can't just be her metaphorical punching bag, when she's very stressed, if that is indeed the case.  When you get pass this as you will, I think you need to talk about it in a calm environment as to the reasons she's getting so angry with you and what *both* of you can do to make things better.

In other experiments where people were given LSD without their knowledge, they were interrogated under bright lights with doctors in the background taking notes. They told subjects they would extend their ""trips"" if they refused to reveal their secrets. The people under this interrogation were CIA employees, U.S. military personnel, and agents suspected of working for the other side in the Cold War. Long-term debilitation and several deaths resulted from this. Heroin addicts were bribed into taking LSD with offers of more heroin.

He writes that technology has had a destabilizing effect on society, has made life unfulfilling, and has caused widespread psychological suffering. **He argues that most people spend their time engaged in useless pursuits because of technological advances; he calls these ""surrogate activities"" wherein people strive toward artificial goals, including scientific work, consumption of entertainment, and following sports teams.** He predicts that further technological advances will lead to extensive human genetic engineering and that human beings will be adjusted to meet the needs of the social systems, rather than vice versa. He believes that technological progress can be stopped, unlike people who understand technology's negative effects yet passively accept it as inevitable. He calls for a return to ""wild nature.""

>Kaczynski argues that the erosion of human freedom is a natural product of an industrial society because ”the system has to regulate human behavior closely in order to function"", and that reform of the system is impossible because ""changes large enough to make a lasting difference in favor of freedom would not be initiated because it would be realized that they would gravely disrupt the system.

""If it is the work of a madman, then the writings of many political philosophers… are scarcely more sane."" David Skrbina, a philosophy professor at the University of Michigan and a former Green Party candidate for governor of Michigan, has written several essays in support of Kaczynski's ideas, one which is titled ""A Revolutionary for Our Times"". Paul Kingsnorth, a former deputy-editor of The Ecologist and a co-founder of the Dark Mountain Project, wrote an essay for Orion Magazine in which he described Kaczynski's arguments as ""worryingly convincing"" and stated that they ""may change my life"".

>Psychiatrist Keith Ablow stated on Fox News that Kaczynski was ""reprehensible for murdering and maiming people"" but ""precisely correct in many of his ideas"", and he compared Industrial Society and Its Future to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Anarcho-primitivist authors such as John Zerzan and John Moore came to Kaczynski's defense while also holding reservations about his actions and ideas.

I really don't think it's to do with being more intelligent than the average audience member.  It's your ability and creativity to see humor where others don't necessarily see that humor.  Often it speaks to the common human experience and being able to relate and then turning that commonality on its' head. And particularly in stand-up comedy, the way (accents, facial expressions, including no expression) you tell the story, the narrative greatly influences the success of the humor. One of the best comedians, and often rated by other comedians as one of the best, is Richard Pryor.

>...case of dancing mania that occurred in Strasbourg, Alsace, (now modern day France) in the Holy Roman Empire in July 1518. Around 400 people took to dancing for days without rest and, over the period of about one month, some of those affected collapsed or even died of heart attack, stroke, or exhaustion.

Edited: To add

>The outbreak began in July 1518 when a woman, Frau Troffea, began to dance fervently in a street in Strasbourg. This lasted somewhere between four and six days. Within a week, 34 others had joined, and within a month, there were around 400 dancers, predominantly female. Some of these people died from heart attacks, strokes, or exhaustion. One report indicates that, for a period, the plague killed around fifteen people per day. However, the sources of the city of Strasbourg at the time of the events did not mention the number of deaths, or even if there were fatalities.  
>  
>Historical documents, including ""physician notes, cathedral sermons, local and regional chronicles, and even notes issued by the Strasbourg city council"" are clear that the victims danced. It is not known why these people danced, some even to their deaths.

> A landmark study on the topic by Donald Davis and his team of researchers from the University of Texas (UT) at Austin’s Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry was published in December 2004 in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition. They studied U.S. Department of Agriculture nutritional data from both 1950 and 1999 for 43 different vegetables and fruits, finding “reliable declines” in the amount of protein, calcium, phosphorus, iron, riboflavin (vitamin B2) and vitamin C over the past half century. Davis and his colleagues chalk up this declining nutritional content to the preponderance of agricultural practices designed to improve traits (size, growth rate, pest resistance) other than nutrition.

> The Organic Consumers Association cites several other studies with similar findings: A Kushi Institute analysis of nutrient data from 1975 to 1997 found that average calcium levels in 12 fresh vegetables dropped 27 percent; iron levels 37 percent; vitamin A levels 21 percent, and vitamin C levels 30 percent. A similar study of British nutrient data from 1930 to 1980, published in the British Food Journal,found that in 20 vegetables the average calcium content had declined 19 percent; iron 22 percent; and potassium 14 percent. Yet another study concluded that one would have to eat eight oranges today to derive the same amount of Vitamin A as our grandparents would have gotten from one.

Regarding surgery. How long did it take you to recover - more importantly, how long before you could run again? Was there any side effects like permanently numb toes? For me surgery would be a last resort. 

Of the shoes I tested, the Brooks Glycerin and Ghost were two options. I liked the Glycerin but it was similar to the Saucony -  so went for the Saucony as the slightly more cost-effective option 

I think regarding the runners nails, I remember it was after a particularly long and steep downhill run last year - I can actually remember my ties hitting the front of my shoes and I have soft toenails, so it can be attribute it to that. Regarding the neuroma, you’re  right about the narrow shoes and repeated impact. I’ve also been wearing some medium sized heeled shoes over the weekend, which I don’t normally do.  Those generally places pressure on the ball of the foot and squashes the toes although my heeled shoes aren’t very narrow in front...but still. And I think this together with the pretty intense (for me) hill repeats just made the neuroma painful. 

I’ll walk around in the Sauconys tomorrow and will take them back if they prove to roomy after this week of training. My previous shoes all have been just one size up. Thanks again for your response; I’ve never met anyone else with Morton’s Neuroma so appreciate your input."
