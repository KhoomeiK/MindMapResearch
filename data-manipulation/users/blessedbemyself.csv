Dogfree,fffu5zp,t3_et21bo,1579891864.0,"I live in Oakland, CA and pit bulls are the #1 owned dog. There's a ridiculous amount of praise for them here and I cross the sidewalk every other day just to avoid walking by them. In San Francisco and Oakland the underworld (aka large homeless population on the streets) has countless of them; transients get pit bills for protection literally because they're aggressive and can defend their tent if needed. I've been growled at many times by homeless-owned bulls, and they always say, ""Don't worry he's friendly"". Yeah but you got him for protection, so he's not."
