gifs,ffp7rgo,t3_eud39b,1580088348.0,I don't even follow professional sports at all.  But this tragedy made me profoundly sad.  I can only think of him and his family.  I hope they have good people all around them.
whole30,ffp7amy,t3_euef2g,1580088020.0,"That's not right.  I follow the 80/20 rule.  Well, more like the 90/10 rule.  Perfectionism is not good.  If you try and do this 90% of the time, there will be a benefit.  Absolutely.  But crying at a lunch?  Good lord.  Be kind to yourself."
aww,ffo4o46,t1_ffnh3ck,1580074125.0,"""Tekir"" - I googled it.  It seems to refer to the tabby cat.  What would the black and white one be called (or is it the same)?"
Instagramreality,ffo18ti,t1_ffnmqt9,1580073095.0,I decided to own the big boob thing.  There are these longer sleeved t-shirts that say #blessed in cursive right across the chest; I bought one in burgundy.  I'm not a Jesus person; I got it because I have big boobs and having #blessed emblazoned across them is hilarious.  I wear it to work all the time.
exmormon,ffiz24m,t1_ffit75p,1579986248.0,"Thanks, Dan.  I meant for this to be more humorous than insightful.  I would love to see a play or something where this plays out.  Mormons in the afterlife.  I'd laugh my ass off."
exmormon,ffilad4,t1_ffie12v,1579976585.0,"It makes me wonder if God feels sorry for Mormons.  In one sense, they are devoted to what they believe and think it's right.  So God sees this and is all, ""Well, at least they are *trying*...""  Then he also sees where the logical end to such devotion is mindless bumbling through life at the least; actual harm done at its worst.

God figures they deserve to have their wishes fulfilled and awards them their own little special ""celestial kingdom"" in the afterlife, exactly how they imagine it to be.  God thinks it's a little bizarre but knows people should be careful what they wish for.  

Mormons are happy in their ""celestial kingdom"" for a little while, until the consequences kick in.  There's all the infighting between Brother Anderson's 12 wives, half of whom are wondering, ""What's so 'celestial' about this??""  People are bored and uninspired, with men not really knowing what to do and women waiting on them to do something to animate them.  Where the heck are all these celestial babies we're supposed to be having?  If I do get celestial preggers, do I go to the hospital or ???  So many unanswered questions.  

They ask God, ""So, what's the deal here?  We did everything right and it landed us here.  But we still aren't happy.""  God tells them, ""Remember those people who left the church and you said they'd be miserable without Mormonism?""   Celestial Mormons go, ""Yeah.  What about them?""  God says, ""Well, they figured out a long time ago that I, God, don't give them purpose and reward.  They learned to give themselves purpose and seek their own happiness, in whatever form that may take.  Maybe you should try doing that."""
whole30,ffian1s,t3_es8fmm,1579969325.0,"I'm so glad I'm not the only lush who gave up alcohol to do Whole30.  :-)  This is my first round (R1D25).  I was a 2-3 glasses a night chardonnay drinker.  When I started doing Whole30, I was concerned because how was I going to get through the week much less the weekEND without muh wine????  Yet, here I am.  4th weekend in a row sans al-kee-hol.  I feel clearer headed and energetic.  I \*may\* have a glass of wine in February, but I do plan to continue with a 2nd round, absolutely.  Whole30 is just very easy to follow and it's working so why not?"
