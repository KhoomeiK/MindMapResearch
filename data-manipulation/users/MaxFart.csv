Economics,ff9wt37,t1_ff9ugn1,1579723218.0,"Technically, the sanctions began around 2006.  Petroleum sanctions started in late 2017.  According to the rough math I did at my desk, inflation increased almost 150x from 2018-19.  Petroleum production went down 11b.  And all these sanctions were, admittedly, designed for regime change.  Pretty bad.

Uh the rial is at something like 40% inflation.  That's pretty bad.  

Saying ""socialism!"" is just reductionist and silly."
