My sweet kitty had been sick for months with several serious conditions. We tried medication but he wasn’t responding and was getting worse. He went down hill fast the week before Xmas. Could not eat, could not drink. He was suffering. Our regular vet was closed for the week so we went to another (as recommended by our vet if things went so wrong). The vet kept saying well you’ve made your decision, I can’t talk you out of it. Didn’t want to listen to us at all and didn’t want to look at the records we brought. Like damn it it’s 2 days before Xmas, this is our baby do you think we want to do this? I am a medical provider-humans not animals but I can research and learn whats going on with my cat. I would have done anything payed anything if it would meant increased quality of life. But we had talked extensively with our regular vet and we knew once he had gotten to this point we needed to let go. I’m sure the vet didn’t mean to be rude but damn it we where not doing this out of convenience. Sorry, this is very painful. Damn it now I’m crying. Harry, I love you"
