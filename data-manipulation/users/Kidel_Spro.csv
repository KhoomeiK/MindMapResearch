I brought up the religious people, but you prefered to not see that for the sake of you being the white knight. I exclude Instagram because it's riddled with people baiting for attention, some with pics of their asses others by insulting the first ones. They don't do it because they hate women who sleep with guys but to bait the attention of people like you. That's called trolling. About dating apps I never went on any I don't know what happens there. Second paragraph. Slutshaming women who have sex while wanting to date a woman who does the same is not something that sounds like a regular thing. Cognitive dissonance would hit you way too hard. If you have any kind of a source about that I'd be curious to see it. Third as I said I brought up religious people, but someone losing his shit doesn't shame, but insults. Calling someone a son of a bitch for exemple isn't shaming the person on his mother's work. Calling someone motherfucker isn't shaming dads or people who date mothers. It's just an insult, it's different than actually expressing an opinion or fact about the person, it's just throwing words that sound mean."
