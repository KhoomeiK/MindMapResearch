Only way to accurately answer this question is to gather a representative sample of Coladas from throughout the region, seal it in an airtight container, pack it in dry ice and send it to an independent laboratory so they can use modern quantitative technologies like mass spectrometry to give you an exact number.  This would cost a few hundred dollars but it's something the city of Miami could easily fund in order to arrive at an accurate number.

We're legally allowed to consume several stimulants: caffeine, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, nicotine and a few others.  At some point someone should examine if these are the best legal stimulants for society, or if one of the hundred or so stimulants the DEA has banned would actually be healthier.  If the latter is true, we can elect government officials that would change our drug policy to something backed by science.  Personally I think caffeine is nightmare fuel and am no fan of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or nicotine.  The Beatles used to favor a stimulant callled phenmetrazine which our government presently places in Schedule II.  I'd like to give that one a try and see what they thought was so special about it."
