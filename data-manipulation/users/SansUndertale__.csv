Next thing I know she's taking away my electronics?2?2?? thats not a 69 420 nice moment but is a r/wooooosh r/entitleparrnets moment Also the school system sucks and its also a TOTAL invasion of pricacy! One time I didnet evne study hard enough and then my parents told me i needde to study harder!??
