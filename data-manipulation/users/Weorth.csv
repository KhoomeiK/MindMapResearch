It took me around 15 years to finally get out of Cerritos. When I first began I was undecided, then I became an art major, then I left the program and became a culinary arts major. Once I did that I went through the program and finished, but my math component was unfinished because I had a horrible time figuring out the whole thing. I'm at a 4th grade level in math. It was all very depressing. I grew up in a household that home schooled, and very socially isolated, so when it came to getting into a larger, less familiar setting with so many new people, I had no idea how to interact with anyone around me. When I thought I had made friends, I was so happy, and like you, I would have done anything for them. This led me to meet a lot of people who weren't genuine, or beneficial to my growth, and forming unhealthy relationships. By the time I finished with culinary, I thought the people I had met would be friends with me for a while. We had all worked together as a team in the kitchens, and it was an environment that fostered teamwork and comradery. It was a huge disappointment when I found out that basically, like you did, people had their groups. When we took our jackets off and went home for the weekend, all the friendship I had assumed was there was completely gone.

Of course, there were people who would hang about together, but never anyone who would invite me, and because I was (and really still am) so socially awkward, it was hard for me to ask anyone to come out with me, and when I did it was usually a miss. No one wanted to hang out. So a lot of time I spent thinking I had friends, it was completely false. Finding that out was bad.

It lead me to just avoiding trying to make connections. If I didn't try, they wouldn't disappoint me by the end of things, and I wouldn't feel as bad as I did when I had. People remember me. Apparently I'm distinct and not hard to forget, not that any of it is bad, that I've heard, but I wouldn't say it was good enough for them to want to keep in contact with me.

When I went back, after experiencing the environment in the culinary industry that completely gutted me, I went back while I was in a bad place. My logic was that if I went back and picked something up, my family wouldn't worry about me. They would see me doing something with myself, and then when everything seemed normal, I could finally step off and disappear. I had changed my major back to Studio Arts when I returned, took 15 units for the first semester. I was in a horrible headspace, but as I went through the program, I found out by the end of the semester that I had fooled myself into sticking around on Earth. Of course, by that point I was 31, and I had a lot of regret because I felt like I had wasted so much time trying to figure myself out. Another semester of 15 units, I had applied to try and get my math requirement waived so I could get out of Cerritos, halfway wondering what I was going to do with myself, and also hopeful that I could continue on to a larger school, I had applied to a few different CSUs, but Long Beach was the one I wanted most. 

I had known the professor I was working with in my painting and drawing classes from the years prior when I had first been in the art program, and he was very encouraging. I love Professor Najarian. I didn't see any sort of future for myself until I joined the art program. I made a lot of friends finally while in the program, but my head-space is still lingering in the ""Once we all go home, we put away the friendships."" so while I do speak with some of the people I worked with while in the art program, I still keep my skepticism as to whether or not they'll stick, which is detrimental. These people I met were so much better than any other group of ""friends"" I had known in the past. We all shared a common interest, despite our different styles. I miss a lot of them. On the final day of my final class of Fall 2019, even while I knew I had finally succeeded in graduating and transferring, I cried because that was it. My long chapter there was finally over, and I wouldn't be returning. I am moving on.

I try to keep in contact with the people I've met, but we all have our own lives we're moving on to. One of my classmates is taking classes with me this coming semester, we both transferred at the same time, but we both have that same mentality. We're friends, but we're not going to be disappointed if we don't make any more while we're at Long Beach.

I would love to. It would be nice, but I don't hold any sort of expectations of anything being lasting, and I'm finally able to live with that a lot better than I was in the past.

I'm not saying you shouldn't still try, but try to also set yourself up to be ready for any sort of disappointment that comes your way. It'll help you cope better in the long run when things don't work out."

It's 2020, and I'm finally starting at a state university. I don't know how old you are now, but don't feel too bad. It took me 16 years to get out of community college. I was home schooled, and my mother wasn't all that knowledgeable, that and we used a Christian based study curriculum, which was dated. I joke that the time I spent in community college was me going from elementary to high school all over again.

But the thing to remember is: keep going, finish up, and maybe try to figure out how to be your own boss. I don't know what career path you chose, but try to see if it's anything you can maneuver into your own business, maybe if you hit on something nice, you can retire early."
