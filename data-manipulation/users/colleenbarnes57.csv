cats,ff5pc11,t3_ersstf,1579604525.0,I think he is probably developing some arthritis around all the joints he damaged. Stretching those joints always makes my arthritis feel better.

australia,femiapq,t3_epyjcl,1579257007.0,"Did you notice how the LNP MPs exclude themselves from being covered by their own policy? They can harass any staff in parliament and then decide whether or not they should suffer any consequence. I wonder if they will choose reasonable sanctions for themselves. Theyâ€™re good men, mostly, so I guess we can just trust them on this issue."

australia,felh2ry,t3_epslog,1579222007.0,Well yeah. Malcolm is right. Malcolm was always right about this issue. So the LNP knifed him and gave us Scotty. Another great LNP move.
australia,fejfes1,t1_fejboe4,1579171566.0,"The absolute crap bible is not in the fiction part of the library. Sadly it is in the 200s, with all the other religious crap. Otherwise, I wholeheartedly agree with you."

australia,fejc41f,t3_epgvq5,1579166565.0,"This archbishop says that priests have died to preserve the sanctity of the confessional. Why would they? To protect some asshole, not necessarily a pedophile, from his nasty deeds. I bet the the priests whoâ€™ve died to uphold this piece of religious bullshit are few and far between. Their interest in protecting others seems less than zero to me. Especially their interest in protecting children."
cats,fejbt19,t3_epgw4l,1579166103.0,Stop feeling him up and heâ€™ll stop being angry I think.
australia,fejbj6o,t1_feioh5e,1579165696.0,They really are. Unless you are in a seat they think they can take. Then I guess you win. For a little while anyway.
australia,feifz8p,t3_epbur6,1579137635.0,LNP strikes again. No moral compass at all. The most needy communities are so often in Labor seats and the LNP ignores their pleas for more facilities for their kids. It really is sickening.

australia,fehx3yt,t1_fehwtx7,1579125600.0,"But the site will only take registered tradespeople. I think it is great that you would like to help out, but donâ€™t know where you could look for volunteering information. With the fires still burning we might not be up to that rebuilding bit yet."

australia,fehvycg,t3_ep8xx3,1579124948.0,"The LNP is completely without an understanding of morality. Not only do they shame us nationally, but also in almost every international issue. If it wasnâ€™t so terribly wrong to only ever help ourselves, we would be the laughing stock of the world."
