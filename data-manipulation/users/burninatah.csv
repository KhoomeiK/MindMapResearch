Read the rest of my comment.

You should read up in Bretton Woods. In a nutshell, after ww2 the dollar was pegged to the price of gold, and everything else was either pegged or floated relative to the dollar. This allowed for the world to be flooded with dollars which allowed devastated economies to rebuild using a currency that was in effect as stable a value hold as gold. Yes this was obviously good for the US and created the hegemony that you seem to despise, but that was the cost that the war ravaged and economically shattered world had to pay to rebuild. 

Oil was and remains a major commodity and so in order to simplify the global system it is traded in dollars. As I explained earlier, there is a significant cost to having to deal in multiple currencies simultaneously. The better way is to pick one, and you want to pick the currency with the lowest possible likelihood of default. Given that the odds of the dollar going belly up are effectively zero that's what was chosen, and given that the cost of switching to a different currency would be astronomical for no tangible benefit, here we are and here we will stay."

There were funny moments and scary ones too, but ultimately it was just so sad that after a point it was impossible to connect with the person who was my idol. It was hard too because you could tell how frustrating it was for him: not being able to drive, then not being able to run the business he started from scratch, then not knowing where he was, then not being able to have a consistent cognitive existence from one day to the next. Thinking your wife of 50 years is just some nice lady that takes care of you and drives you around to places. It was heartbreaking. The luckiest thing through it all was that there were people like yourself who knew what to do both with him and with us.

worldnews,ffe5spo,t1_ffe4qdw,1579837455.0,"The US dollar isn't the only currency that central banks hold, most are diversified across a number of major currencies.

Part of the way that the US puts pressure countries such as Iran is to prevent their ability to conduct transactions in US dollars. If the petrodollar theory was correct then this would not be in our best interest at all, but yet we do it all the time."
worldnews,ffdutze,t1_ffdkp5v,1579829479.0,"Oil is traded in dollars because the dollar is the global reserve currency. The reason the dollar is the global reserve currency has nothing to do with oil. 

If you are running a business, you want some confidence that the pieces of paper you trade your oil/gold/widgets for are going to be worth something for the foreseeable future. This is why grocery stores aren't interested in, say, bitcon: no one wants to risk trading their goods for a currency that might have half the purchasing power tomorrow as it did today. Alternatively, if you are trying to buy drugs on the internet the pseudo-anonymous features of the currency become a major selling point and you therefore accept the risk of unpredictable value fluctuation. 

The US dollar is the most reliable currency in the world, therefore large actors like nationstates use it as a reserve currency. If the US dollar goes belly up, the global economy (as we all understand that term to mean) no longer exists in any recognizable way. You'd be trading in bullets and access to water rather than some fiat. 

There are massive efficiencies to be gained as a seller if you aren't needing to deal in multiple currencies. Imagine trying to run a grocery store where goods are simultaneously priced in multiple currencies. This would be bedlam, as customers would be able to find opportunities for arbitrage due to currency fluctuations, all at your expense. The United States before the creation of the federal reserve is a good example of this sort of mess. Better to just price your goods in one particular currency, maintain your balance sheet in that same currency, and let people play the forex game elsewhere. 

And what currency should you pick? Well you need something that most actors already have and/or can easily get, you want something that credit markets are willing to deal in, and you want something that you know you'll be able to spend with as little friction as possible anywhere in the world sometime in the future. Your best bet would be the US dollar."

You asked how you were supposed to find the dropout podcast about her. The answer to that question is, you take the information you have in front of you (a podcast called ""the dropout"", picture of crazy looking lady) and you type that shit into Google. Google will hit you back with pictures of that same lady, and will likely include a block of text right at the top that reads something to the effect of:
> Jarvis is the host and creator of “The Dropout,” a top rated podcast which chronicles the rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes and her company, Theranos; Jarvis also hosts and created the “No Limits with Rebecca Jarvis” podcast; and the Host and Managing Editor of “Real Biz with Rebecca Jarvis”.

Zwift,fehxq15,t3_ep68bm,1579125963.0,"1. The apps cannot and/or should not necessarily be integrated.  They do different things.  One is the actual game, one is a controller.  This of it this way: back in the day the controls for a television were integrated into the box, while nowadays we separate out the controls to a separate remote; this is an improvement.  When I bike in Zwift I have the game running on a laptop hooked up to a TV, and I have the companion app on my phone mounted to my handlebars.  I sure as shit don't want the laptop mounted anywhere near my handlebars, I want a (remote) controller.  When I run in Zwift I just run the game on my phone and so don't need the companion app.  
2. The graphics output is based on the hardware you're using.  You can choose the output resolution in the settings, but this does not control an internal (to the game) profiling tool that looks at your hardware and applies a display profile accordingly.  I use a very old laptop to run the game when I ride, and so I would much rather the game not attempt to render complex shadows/lighting effects in exchange for keeping the frame rate passable.  I am personally happy that they allow for the game to run on a wide range of hardware, rather than requiring modern graphics cards.  
3. The shop is working fine.  You're likely using an ad blocker or something else that manipulates the code that their website is trying to run, and this sometimes breaks sites.  Certainly this isn't the first time you've encountered this phenomenon.
4. I've had good experiences with the support folks.  I've also found answers to most of my issues in their forum.

On the whole Zwift is a pretty amazing tools for what it is.  You have a few thousand people from all over the world on wildly disparate hardware connecting into number of virtual worlds and the whole thing runs well enough that you can draft off a person from South Africa or Taipei or Phoenix.  Riding on a trainer or running on a treadmill in a gym has been boring as hell since they were invented, and now instead we have a platform in which we can ride and race with people all year long.   And if you run the game on a dedicated pixel pushing computer it looks pretty damn good.

Its not perfect, but I don't know of anything else out there that comes close.  Ultimately I'm doing this because I want to ride my bike more, and Zwift keeps me coming back day after day.  That's a win to me."

HIIT,fe8y3pz,t3_eke4mn,1578932245.0,"I would encourage you to observe a distinction between cushioning and support.  I know from my own experience trying to find a perfect running shoe that just sticking a huge chunk of foam between the road and me didn't do anywhere near as much for my comfort as actually finding the right mix of arch support, toebox width, and overall size.  Basically I needed something that would grip my heel but also allow for my toes to splay without being squashed.  This is why some people can run ultra marathons in minimalist shoes without an ounce of foam cushioning while others will be rolling around in pain even with a pair of Hokas.  

My recommendation would be to get separate shoes for HIIT and running.  I personally love my Reebok Nano 2 for HIIT/lifting/gym workouts, but I don't run in them.  When it comes time to push some miles I am partial to Altra Escalante/Lone Peak (road/trail, respectively) and Brooks Ghost.  Once I find a shoe that works for me I use [runrepeat.com](https://runrepeat.com) to find similar offerings from manufacturers.

I know you aren't asking this, but I would recommend you consult a doctor to help figure out the cause of your shin splints.  They are a symptom of an actual underlying issue.
