“I told you it wasn’t a phase” I smirk, brushing off my MCR t shirt, and gliding off into the distance, even more goth now that my shadow surrounds me."

Everyone has something called proprioception: that’s  the sense of your body and the movements it makes. Some people need more proprioceptive input, like bouncing on a trampoline or snuggling with a weighted blanket. 
It makes you feel more grounded and calm."
wholesomememes,fcy4vsj,t1_fcxyob5,1578074830.0,It’s also really great for ppl with ADHD (like me) and/or autism who need the deep pressure!
haircoloring,fa8btsn,t3_e80bvm,1575844025.0,"Try highlights. It would give you the lightness you want while still showing your natural color. Look up “natural highlights” and see if you find anything you like. Or show them a pic of your longer hair and say that’s the color you want. If you go to the right stylist, they can be pretty good with making highlights discreet. 
Or try some natural lightening solutions like lemon juice and chamomile tea, if you want less chemicals in your hair. These methods will take a while to work, and maybe not work at all, but it’ll be worth a go.
