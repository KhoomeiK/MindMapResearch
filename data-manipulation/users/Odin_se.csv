UpliftingNews,ffc3pfj,t3_ess8d0,1579790775.0,"As while one of the laws taxing the very wealthiest people in my country was just taken down. :(

If anyone wants to read Swedish: **Värnskatten avskaffas** Den femprocentiga tilläggskatten för den högsta inkomstnivån tas bort. Avskaffandet av värnskatten var ett av Liberalernas viktigaste krav för att släppa fram Stefan Löfven som statsminister. Beslutet har väckt häftig kritik mot regeringen, framför allt från vänsterhåll."
graphic_design,ffalo33,t1_ffal1qs,1579738854.0,"I looked a little closer. You're right, it's not even a logo up in the corner. It's the icon for a broken image link. *Smh*

So much wasted money.."
graphic_design,ffai85o,t1_ffaek3j,1579736342.0,"Haha, the few ones that can see (and notice) that teeny tiny logo you mean?"
graphic_design,ffa0luc,t3_escs25,1579725470.0,Hmm.. If you've ever advertised you know that by far the biggest cost of advertising is not the design part but the cost of the ad space.
knifemaking,ff8i2jg,t1_ff7w3fx,1579679458.0,Thanks man! The handle is a maple burl hybrid I've made myself.
knifemaking,fezwxkm,t1_fez8gtu,1579462738.0,"Come to think of it, not so far away from my town is a company that makes cheese that is famous in our country. They have tried to make it at different locations but the cheese has never turned out good at those places. They made a commercial joking around that it must be something in the water (amongst other silly things).

Haha, maybe they were right? *wink* Take a look for yourself. Search for: something in the water Västerbottensost."
knifemaking,fezvhp2,t1_fez82tx,1579462190.0,"Yeah, it took me a while to figure out where I should put the switch and the battery because I wanted it to be able to be replaced."
knifemaking,fey6xez,t1_fey57p9,1579441541.0,"Yeah, the lights was just a thing I tested out. I don't think I'm gonna be doing it again, but I actually think it looked kinda neat. And it didn't take away any of the beauty of the knife and sheath as you could just leave it off."

Yeah, he's a very good knifemaker, and very humble. The funny thing is that he lives like 30 minutes away from me, haha."
