Here's an old stoner trick though for busting it down by hand: Rub two nugs together and it should flake off well enough. Not perfect but better than trying to break off tiny bits with your fingers."

nononono,feci67w,t3_eoa1lm,1578974503.0,"This happened to me recently while working at a hotel. A guest left their tailgate open for some time so I went out and closed it. But I didn't want to close it all the way in case their keys were in there, so I tried to leave my fingers in the crack when I closed it so it wouldn't click shut. Apparently, new cars these days have a motor in them that will close the tailgate, and my fingers got jammed for about 20 seconds before I got them loose. I thought I was gonna lose my fingers lmao but they were fine the next day."

Refillable lighter (clippers are dope)  
  
Pint glasses actually make the best ash trays.  
  
If you like to roll, rolling machines are hella convenient and don't take anyone's shit for using one.  
  
Perforated filters with a gummed tip are highly recommended if you are rolling.  
  
Smell-proof container. Search on Amazon for a urine sample container for a cheap solution that is just as effective as a Mason jar. Smaller and will not break as well."

Most come with a boveda humidity pack so they keep long after opening (resealable package). I usually get the 0.8g rollies but the 0.5 mini rollies are perfect for when you want to smoke a blunt but not use a ton of bud.  
  
They are undoubtedly better than anything else. The only thing to decide is whether it's worth the price, but blunts are usually a special occasion for me anyways so they are to me."
