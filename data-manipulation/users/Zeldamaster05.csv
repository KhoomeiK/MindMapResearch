You can play the long game, which means building up the relationship and blah blah, but I don’t know if this is going to work. Maybe be try the short game, where you would ask some innocent questions to make sure he likes you, and when you are sure, just confess. If I were you, I would just pass him a note where you confess on the last day before some holiday or something, he will text you back. This way, you avoid social interaction. If he doesn’t respond via text, text him if he got the note or something.
