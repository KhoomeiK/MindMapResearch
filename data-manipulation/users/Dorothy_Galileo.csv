Say something, you can even tell him first before you do. Something like “ I care about you and cant stand by this behavior, you need to get help.” 
It’s almost like he’s self sabotaging himself in a way. I’m sorry you and your family are going through this."

Not the asshole at all, but I don’t think you get a say in their decision. The child could be put up for adoption though. Your son wants to learn life lessons the hard way. I hate that an innocent baby will be thrown into this mess, it seems that’s your worry too. NAH, but I don’t know what can be done, I’m so sorry.

Edit to say- your son needs the Dr. Phil ranch"
Skincare_Addiction,ff1x4jb,t3_er3f2b,1579488182.0,I fucking hate coconut oil! I was applying straight coconut oil to my face for a moisturizer 2 summers ago because of a Pinterest pin🤦‍♀️. I went from ok skin.. to horrible break out...to fungal acne. Thank goodness you know now it doesn’t work for you. Coconut oil has given me a post stress disorder🤣
Thetruthishere,ff1tnwv,t3_eqrnu8,1579485932.0,"I’m sorry you were blamed for this. God, I can’t imagine the grief you went through, then to be accused on top of it. This is such a tragic story. I’m glad his last moments on earth he got to spend them giggling with you. 
This encounter made me think of a story I heard years ago, I listen to a lot of paranormal podcasts. This man called in about his missing friend from 30 years ago. They were about 10 years old and off for the summer, they would play at the ball field near their school. The school would leave the doors unlocked for kids to use the rest rooms. I’m guessing this was in the 70’s. Him and his friend went in the school to use the bathroom. There were open stalls lined up- with the doors open. He specifically remembers looking in the stalls, to make sure no one was in there. He stayed outside the bathroom while his buddy handled his business. As the guy was waiting for his friend, they were talking and joking. He said it got really quiet and he asked if his friend was almost done. His friend said he heard a noise in the stall next to him. He then tried to push the main door open to check on his friend and it wouldn’t open. His friend then started to cry and said he was scared. He said he would never forget the blood curdling scream he heard next. He actually urinated it scared him so bad. He ran all the way home to get his mom, she called the cops. They searched the whole school and his little friend was never found. The guy said there was only a small window in that bathroom that a human couldn’t fit through. I’ve never forgot that story. They thought he did something to his friend too. You could tell listening to him that it still scared the shit out of him decades later. So heartbreaking."
offmychest,ff1nb0w,t3_er4coq,1579482024.0,"Oh gurrrrrl, we all think we’re ugly. Why do you think the beauty industries are worth billions? BILLIONS. I get caught up in it too. I do until I hear someone else’s story. I read a story on Reddit today, this teenage girl had gotten in an accident and it left her face scarred and her nose crooked (noticeably) She said she worked at a food drive thru and there were teenagers that would take pictures of her face, to be cruel. She wanted to know if she’d be an asshole for flicking them off. If SHE would be an asshole.. lol. The only asshole thing in that whole story was how those kids treated her. That’s asshole as fuck. When I read that i forgot about my own looks and was pissed for her. If there is a team, I’d much rather be with “ugly” girls. What’s beautiful anyway? Her telling her story was beautiful, you telling yours now is beautiful. Even if it’s on Reddit, you’re putting your vulnerability out there and connecting. The only one putting these standards up is you. You don’t need to be anything more than you are. Hugs from an “ugly” girl💕"

AmItheAsshole,fenzofj,t3_eq5tuk,1579293057.0,NTA Aww this is really sad. There’s not much else you can do. She’s made it pretty clear she doesn’t want to be friends. Seems like she’s being an asshole. Even if stuff is happening in her personal life she should still treat you kindly. You should let her go and that sounds harsh but she’s been a little harsh to you. She should have at least spoken to you at her family Christmas party. What a jerk:(
offmychest,fenxv0z,t3_eq5cgi,1579292452.0,"I’m not going to take up for your mom. “Oh you enjoy this?” Let’s add a bunch of pressure about making money until you hate the hobby. That’s the life of an adult, in a lot of cases. That’s why being a kid is important, you can try out different things WITHOUT pressure. I think she was unfair. Though, in her eyes I’m sure she thought she was trying to get you ready for the real world.. she was wrong. Now this is easier said than done but she isn’t around you anymore, do what you love. Don’t say you can’t. Lots of writers have dry spells, all the good ones at least. It’ll work out for you, keep your head up😊"
offmychest,fenv2n2,t3_eq5djd,1579291283.0,"Hmm I’m in my mid 30’s. Only had sex with American men. I just figured they all suck. I enjoy having an orgasm- if I knew I could receive that with my partner, I’d want sex way more. It’s all about pleasing them and 98% of the time he’s the only one who orgasms. Now orally he can get the job done but I don’t like asking. I feel guilty if he’s down there longer than 4 minutes. Fucking guilt complex over here while he gets to orgasm whenever we have sex. It’s like a chore at this point. Its not just him- it’s been like that with every man I’ve had sex with. Nice to know it’s not the same everywhere. Enjoy it!

I remember being at mass during school.. we went every Wednesday morning. Above the alter was Jesus with the garment around his privates. I would stare at it the whole mass. Those nights I would try to go to sleep and couldn’t get the picture out of my head. I felt severe guilt. Even typing that now I feel sort of gross but it happens. Thoughts happen.

OCD,fe9au4i,t1_fe97hlp,1578935967.0,"It’s really exhausting. Have you ever gone to therapy or tried meds? I hate the idea of taking meds to be “normal”, but maybe it would help silence the ongoing chatter in my head. Everything is making sense the more I learn. Not sure if you have kids, but it really intensified after becoming a mother. I actively obsess about being a good enough parent. I guess most parents do, it’s just an unhealthy amount of worry. Wouldn’t it be nice to just live without guilt. I can’t imagine sometimes. Good luck to you"

Life isn’t as long as you’d think, what matters is the relationships we have. It’s how we treat the ones closest to us.
