alzo zinc increases semen production using the prostrate the zinc is not in the accual seman, so spewing it out dont change your zinc level at all

buildapc,ff82hr1,t1_ff7ztk4,1579664261.0,"My boss used to work at wafer factory. Despite what others are saying. He told me that they test them at every layer of the wafer so like 10,000 times.  

(Its way easier to do this and fix redo a layer then get halfway done realize there was a bad one and throgh the whole thing out and start over)

Then they test every one, ever step of the way until it is done then after it is done. Its one of the most tested products that exist, because its way better for profit to fix a tiny problem and save an $600 cpu x 100,000 of them. Intead of not spending ten thousand + time to make sure they all work

Edit:they especially test the outward cpu's of the wafers because they are the most likely to have errors

Edit2: intel for instance aims for a decfet rate of between 1 in 1,000,000 and 1 in 5,000,000, and most of those never make it to the market, so like maybe 1 in ten million or more cpu's that leave the factory are bad"
