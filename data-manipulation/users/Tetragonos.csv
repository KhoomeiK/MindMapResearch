Therefore society has made it easier to filter out things that unnecessary but has not because of the great and dire importance of political information. Even when taking into account that a large majority of the information is propagandistic and requires sorting to view the truth. 

If you would like to avoid politics I do not know what to tell you on tips and tricks.... I feel that it is only fair that you shoulder some of the burden in being an informed adult and making informed decisions, but if you don't wish to do that and have everyone else make those decisions then you can go to the library and get books that at least have outdated politics in them as opposed to more relevant politics."

stbernards,ffplnk9,t1_ffdt5cp,1580098121.0,"I remember taking my Dad's saint to the dog park. I was unemployed at the time so I spent WAY too much job hunting time not doing that and being the dog's best friend.

I took the saint to the dog park and it was HUGE, 70 or 80 acres at least. Peeves always liked sticking around me and would never really get more than 50 yards away even if there was a giant pack of dogs all having a run, he would always peak behind himself and make sure I was keeping up.

The dog park had the small dog side and the all dogs side. So the small dogs would often be brought over and Peeves was a very gentle friendly sociable dog and liked to great all the new friends. On one such occasion an old old lady brought her little dog over and Peeves came up to say hello. His head was larger than this tiny dog. So naturally the Tiny dog exploded in yips and snarls. Peeves rocketed behind me to hide... which was hilarious because he would tuck his head behind me and the rest of him would be just off to the side.

So Peeves is peaking out from behind me, 90% exposed so this tiny dog is still barking and pulling at the leash as this poor old woman is trying to keep him under control. She obviously is unused to this behavior and quite flustered. She gives me an apologetic look and I just dead pan said to her ""please dont let your dog beat up my dog"".

She turned beat red and went back to the small dog park for another 10 minutes till her dog calmed down."
stbernards,ffpkyp6,t3_etg0je,1580097594.0,"I lived in Oklahoma with a saint and he had a fine life. He had free access to indoors and outdoors  via dog doors. Inside was air conditioned, but he would often go out and romp around in the heat of summer. I know this is controversial but we shaved him in the summer and he seemed to be fine with it. The only problem we had with that was when the groomners would take the hair off his tail and it would lose all wind resistance and he would be able to bend steel I beams with the damned thing.

Mind you he had 13 acres to run around on and he grew up there, so he may just not have known any better and having the space to run around.

I say living in Florida is not a solo reason not to get a saint. I think that the wrong set of factors would be a disaster but if you understand what you are doing and you have the right environment it could work just fine.

If you just want a big dog like a saint, then a great dane is a short hair that is large and friendly, but that is a conversation for you and your wife to have. If she is just in love with saints and that is all it will be, then you guys need to talk about quality of life and how your home/living situation will impact your future dog's life.

I would love to see an update with what ever plan you do go with even if it is not a saint. I hope you find a universally beneficial solution for everyone."
