teenagers,ffe1vgi,t3_et3607,1579834530.0,Remember one time I liked a girl so I told a friend who knew her pretty well. He hyped me up and convinced me that asking her out in person ASAP would be a good idea. So a couple days after I did only to find out that he had basically set me up and told her I was going to ask her out. She said no which is perfectly fine and she was nice about it but I felt pretty betrayed and a bit set up. Also felt kinda dumb I let myself get so convinced it was a good idea.

I assume this is the guy and he has been arrested after turning himself in and charged with animal cruelty and attacking a protected species.
