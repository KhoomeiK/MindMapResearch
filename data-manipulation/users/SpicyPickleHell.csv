AskReddit,fdd0mol,t3_ekpkiw,1578290127.0,"I used to never cry at anything but then experienced some traumatic event. Everything is okay as okay can be now but since then I've become a huge softy and tear up at almost any sad scene in a game, movie, show, anime, book and even adverts that have sad music or emotions. Even stupid things where you KNOW the Hero or whatever is going to come back to life in the arms of the character or whatever. I just can't help it anymore. 

It feels good to feel if that makes sense? Especially since I used to just kind of scoff or not care at how sadness and loss is portrayed in media.  I find tearing up during stuff like that embarrassing so I try to hide it when with my SO or a friend in a situation like that."

I recently left my crappy retail job for a part time graphic design position, then decided I don't wanna do that so I'm doing a part-time masters in computing while working at graphic place. Really depends what you're thinking of doing. You can try the usual job sites or get certification in IT or something or even get a qualification in something else. I use Udemy and Coursera (mostly free!) to boost my knowledge in computing and they have tons of courses for everything else.

AskWomen,fcf4ejk,t3_eh5xff,1577626516.0,"Usually I can estimate when it will start and take pain killers (paracetamol) before it happens, that way the pain is numb before it even starts. I usually take them every three hours when it happens until the third day when the pain stops. It's probably not best practice but it's unbearable if I forget to start the pain killers before it happens so this is my method for both work and home. 

If they're very bad and nothing is helping then consider seeing your GP about it, they might be able to prescribe something more suitable. Hope this helps."
AskReddit,fc9zc7p,t1_fc9ul99,1577560463.0,"I agree with you about an SO venting one side of a story, it's easy to make yourself look like the good guy in an argument when discussing it with third parties! All relationships have disagreements and the majority of which shouldn't be exaggerated in discussion, especially if details are embellished by the story teller. This was a huge issue at the start of my relationship that honestly hurt the relationship between me and their family - I have a very colourful vocabulary and I toss bad words around without meaning them - this got back to SO's very religious parents and made me look super abusive for instance when in truth I'm just a huge fan of swear words, a complete contrast to him and his upbringing!
