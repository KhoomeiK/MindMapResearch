Obviously I disagree with him on many issues, but he hasn't been actually harmful on those issues yet, and that's fine by me. This state has too many nonpartisan issues that need to be dealt with and hopefully he works on that.

DeSantis seems to be a republican I can actually tolerate, unlike Trump and McConnell. He reminds me of the party before it got taken over by crazy people.
