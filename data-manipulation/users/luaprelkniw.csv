Don't blame it on academia, because what you see there is just a reflection of society at large.

But I would also say that things are slowly changing.  As more women attain positions of authority and are able to stomp on these attitudes, the number of incidents will decrease.  Also take note that powerful men who abused their positions over women in the past are paying a high price today.  So there is hope for the future."

I was the same.  I did work that I couldn't bring myself to ask for the going rate, I always felt it was too high.  It took me many months to start demanding what I was worth.  Even then if I was having a down day, a day of self-doubt, for sure I wouldn't ask for the right price.  But what I learned, in the end, was that if you demand what you're worth, people will tell others that you do great work (I even asked for reference letters) and clients will be banging at your door offering you work.  I think if they pay you a lot, they want to brag partly to reassure themselves that they got a great deal."
