ChronicPain,ff8lt85,t3_erzp7p,1579684823.0,"People a use drugs, opioid companies were shady with the marketing and they got pushed when they shouldn't have been which caused addicts who needed a fix and turned to things like heroine. Because this was happening with wealthy people there was a large push against opioids which while not unwarranted in some cases has caused many people to needlessly suffer when they are the right option because a doctor is afraid of the backlash or just straight up doesn't believe you. Plus policies to keep said doctors from abusing them or enabling them ect. 
Unless you meant in China in which case China restricted trade which made the British angry and desperate after losing the colonies tobacco so they sold opioids in India near the border and flooded the Chinese market with them, which caused a significant enough problem for the government to get involved. The British didn't like it and waged what we know as the first opioid war in order to open trade in China and legalize opioids, the later they refused even on losing the war badly to only a few British ships. This is a very broad take on it with likely a few inaccuracies but it's an interesting situation I recommend you read up on if interested."
