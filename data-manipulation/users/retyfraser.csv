I do have a few questions though. What are your thoughts about enrolling to a part time cinematography course in my local college and studying ? Wouldn't that be of use? Because if a company is looking to hire someone it makes sense to be a properly qualified cinematographer or. Photographer who's qualified. In today's world we have lots of photographers and everyone takes pictures, but knowing technicals and having a degree helps no?"
