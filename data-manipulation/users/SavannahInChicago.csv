I *was* a lot more active. Going to the gym 5-6 days a week. Walking over 10,000 steps a day no matter what, then over 15,000. I ate less then because I had less muscle and just weighed less. 

Now, I try to average 10,000 steps over a week, but if I am a little short, who cares. I have days where I almost get back up to 15,000 steps and days I get 7,000. 

I am in the gym 4 days a week. My protein intake is not as high as it used to be 120g and still seeing results, sometimes a little bit higher, instead of 150g minimum. It’s not much, but does have an effect on calorie intake. 

My waist is 28-29” on any given day. It used to be 26” with the goal of getting to 25”. If I took the time to drop back down and trim some fat from my waist I would be eating less. But I’m fine with a little thickness. I have that nice line down my stomach regardless and I’m not as obsessed with being small as I used to."

xxfitness,feivlz7,t3_epdel2,1579148424.0,"**how to overcome the fear of going alone to the gym?**

I had a friends take me to his gym and he showed me how to do lifts. Later, when I wanted to start I first worked out at a small apartment gym where there was never more than 3 people there at a time. I then went to a commercial gym to lift for the first time at night when there are less people. 

Get a buddy to come with you if you can. Go on off-peak times so there are less people. Putting on headphone and tuning out everyone can work. Also, practice your form at home with youtube videos before you go. Lastly, at the end of your work out, look around and realize that everyone is so focused on themselves they never noticed you.

**do i need protein shakes or protein bars before working out?**

Meal timing does not matter, all that matters is you get your overall protein at some point during the day. Shakes and bars are never necessary. You can get plenty of protein from food, but they are there if you are having trouble getting your protein, are looking for a convenient way to get protein, etc. 

**what’s the best equipment to use for lower abs and upper abs? what’s the best equipment for glutes? what workout do you recommend doing?** 

Yay! You are looking for a routine. Selecting a good beginner routine and not just closing exercises are random is best for results. I have been weight turning for over 3 years and just getting to the point where I can start to put together a somewhat effective program for myself. And this is only because I have done a lot of research and put in the time at the gym to see what succeeds and fails. I still have a ways to go though. 

Bret Contretras Strong Curves is a good beginner program for glutes. There is a sub just for that. If you don't want to pay for the e-book there is spreadsheet online if you search. Also, Thinner Leaner Stronger is a good full body beginners program. This will go on sale on Amazon for 99 cents everyone once and a while. 

Stay off of Youtube for program ideas. Stay with prewritten programs until you can understand why the exercises/sets/reps/volume/intensity, etc has been selected. But you can use it just to look up form.

xxfitness,fefwp1r,t3_eox1zy,1579067674.0,"You are looking at a few things specially. Some of the things you mention matter in losing body fat. Some other things don’t really. 

* Where we put on/keep/lose fat has a lot to do with genetics. There are some people who can never get down to where they want with belly fat without getting too thin. 

For instance, I can’t lose enough fat in my belly before my chest looks skeletal and my ribs start to really stick out. Not a great look. 

* to recomp you need to eat at maintainace. I have no idea if that is yours or not. Ideally your weight on a weekly average shouldn’t really change at all. If it’s 150 one day, it should be almost the same week after week. 

If you gain too fast eat less. If you are losing, gain more. It may take weeks to figure out the amount you should eat. 

* Recomping is slowwwwww. Keep in mind that a lot of those people plastered on IG that are looking amazing after recomping a little are genetically gifted. 

I have spent the last couple years going to between bulking and recomping. Focus on pushing that weight! If you look in the mirror after a couple weeks expecting to see easy changes you may be disappointed (if you are a total beginner this will be the norm after the newb gains stop). 

* Up that protein. It doesn’t have to be an insane amount. There are a lot of numbers for this thrown around. I am 153 lbs and try to get minimum 120g, but try to get more and usually end up between 130g ad 150g."

* Intensity. If you got the failure every exercise it is not smart to work that muscle group more than a couple times a week. Same with weight. If you are doing 90% of you 1 rep max every single lift of your program it will be harder to work out that muscle more.

* Frequency. You can work some muscle more than others. Abs can really be worked out everyday. Abs are working around the clock to keep you upright. It’s hard to work them to the point tHey can’t recover. Other body parts need more time to recover or can be overloaded on less days. 

* Volume. Muscle have a minimum and maximum volume for growth. If you hit that maximum on one day it’s not a good idea to do another workout.

* Genetics. A lot of recommendations on volume, frequency, etc are an average. There are people who will not fall into that average and can do more or less of the averages given for training to see results. No one can tell you where you fall. It takes a lot of self experimentation over a long length of time.

Trazadone is a prescription anti-depressant used off label for sleep. You still need to relax your body, but it is the first thing that got me to regularly sleep after the worst bout of insomnia I ever had.

But you need something more accessible. Usually sleep stories work on days I can't fall asleep. Calm has an app, but I honestly just search and they are on Youtube. The Nordland Night Train is my favorite. Try to concentrate on the story and \*only\* on the story. No other thoughts.

I know this is going to seem funny, but sometimes I sleep at the foot of my bed and it is enough to fall asleep. I can't even rationalize why, but sometimes it works. 

What finally got me to sleep last night was Magnesium. I used Magnesium Citrate. It is like $2 at the drug store. A word of warning, is it advertised as a laxative. I knew my personal history with this from when I needed a laxative.  It did shit for me in that department, but made me tired, so I trusted that part of it would not be a problem. If you are unsure then another form of Magnesium is probably best.

truechildfree,fcnd75x,t1_fcmkyuu,1577809206.0,I think it’s a way to live on after death. More about mortality than actually doing something extraordinary. We live on this earth for close to 100 years and for most of us it is like we were never even here. Some people are comforted that there are family with their name that they can be traced to.

Do you know understand the scientific method? Did you not remember the part about limiting biases? Can you not do that in other parts of your life? 

I know we live in a world where society has a certain idea about what disability looks like and I know we have this idea about what makes a productive citizen and what happiness looks like. I just wish people would take more time to challenge these ideas and questions things. I really wish that the people who need to the most were forced to."

This is scary. I am studying history and every instance that we study eugenics is in the past. So, we cover it in the 30s and World War 2 and kind of move on. I assumed that it was no longer a thing. 

Is the fact that is completely disproved and a pseudoscience discussed? 

 \> I was just really shocked about how many people support eugenics and then they also get very upset when you call them out for supporting eugenics.

That is usually how racism works and the two are really one-and-the-same, so that is not surprising. Eugenics was used to support white superiority. It created a system in which black people, jews, etc. were ""genetically"" inferior to justify bad treatment in general, genocide at its worse. Now, that I write that maybe I am not so surprised given the political climate. 

Sorry you have to go through this. There is a lot of misconceptions that the general public still have about genetic disorders and disabilities. I am glad you are there to prove to them that those with genetic disorders can have a happy life, but sorry you have to do so in the first place."

It’s mostly neglect. We gave a large psych population and we don’t see this with them. 

It’s patients with a lot of medical issues in general or drug abuse. 

We had a female patient who was shooting up in her genitals. It got infected and turned into gangrene. The nurse was describing it and said that you could see up into her body."
