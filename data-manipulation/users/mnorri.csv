You could landfill it, and they did, but a long, long time ago, people figured out that there still is value in the carcass.  

There’s steel, cast iron, aluminum, copper wire etc.  but pulling it all apart manually isn’t cost effective.  If you shred it into manageable bits, you can then use thing like magnets and air to separate the pieces into like materials.  Everyone knows steel is attracted to magnets, so you dump all the bits from the shredder onto a conveyor and, maybe dump them onto a couple other conveyors near a strong magnet.  Steel gets pulled toward the magnet and falls into one hopper while the rest of it goes into another.  If you throw the chunks through a strong magnetic field, the parts that conduct electricity will slow down faster than non-conductive parts because of eddy loops forming and converting kinetic energy to heat, so the conductors don’t fly as far as you expect and they end up in their own bin.  Light, fluffy stuff will move with a strong fan.  Etc.  

There are billions of dollars to be made in this business.  The more, higher quality material you can get to a smelter, the more money you make.  So they continue to improve processes like these.    The equipment is big, expensive and expensive to run, but it makes money - lots of money."
