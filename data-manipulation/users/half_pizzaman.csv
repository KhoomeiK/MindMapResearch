Khashoggi regarding 9/11:

Regarding Bin Laden:  
>You were beautiful and brave in those beautiful days in Afghanistan, before you surrendered to hatred and passion.

In regards to the Muslim Brotherhood, they've been designated as a terrorist group by Saudi Arabia, and with that in mind, even as appeals to authority go, that's quite a ridiculous one. You should actually read the article you supplied, as it's not the indictment of Khashoggi you want it to be:  
>Saudi Arabia’s official attitude toward the Muslim Brotherhood today is that the group is a terrorist organization—but this is a relatively recent policy innovation. For decades, while the kingdom was competing for influence in the Arab world with the secular nationalist regimes of Egypt, Iraq, and Syria, Saudi Arabia welcomed to its soil Brotherhood members who were persecuted or unsafe in their home countries.

>There’s also a degree of willful blindness and hypocrisy in the kingdom’s current insistence that the Brotherhood presents an intolerable and existential threat: Brotherhood-linked politicians and parties sit in parliaments in Saudi Arabia’s close partners Bahrain and Kuwait, the Brotherhood party in Jordan has long been part of the political scene as a cranky but loyal opposition, and in Morocco the Brotherhood-linked Justice and Development Party has led the ruling coalition for the last two governments. All of these countries are close Saudi partners, close American partners, and strong allies in the fight against violent Islamist extremism. When I have inquired with Saudi and Emirati officials about how their view of the Brotherhood as an existential ideological threat relates to their friendly ties with governments that incorporate Brotherhood actors, they say that each Arab country makes its own sovereign decisions—a view they could hardly abide by if they truly saw this movement as a terrorist organization.

>Khashoggi was reporting on these fighters for an official Saudi newspaper, apparently with some degree of admiration at their faith, commitment, and moxie, at a time when their efforts were supported by the Saudi government. Other Western journalists and commentators—not to mention politicians—were likewise enamored with the mujahideen, during a period when the Reagan administration and Congress worked hand-in-glove with Saudi Arabia to support these insurgents against Soviet occupation. As Ignatius makes clear in the piece cited earlier, Khashoggi “grew wary” of bin Laden and his violent intent toward the United States and the kingdom, and believed Saudis and Arabs needed to be forthright in acknowledging bin Laden’s responsibility for the 9/11 attacks.

What ever happened to being the party of fiscal responsibility?"
PoliticalHumor,ff6xpf6,t1_ff6oyyw,1579637036.0,">The ideologies of the parties have never changed.

That's blatantly false, even if you exclude the racial stuff, Republicans used to implement regulations on big business, run up the national debt(without preaching otherwise), and were in favor of tariffs, the latter of which only became en vogue again these past 4 years.

>All the racist Democrats who had opposed the Civil Rights Act in the 1960’s were the same ones who in the 1970’s supported Roe v. Wade.

Wouldn't that have been before the 'moral majority' was established, and pushed the Republicans further right on certain issues, most notably abortion? Which happens to be another one of those pesky ideological shifts that apparently don't happen.  

That said, prior to Roe v. Wade, the South, which was almost entirely controlled by Democrats, only allowed abortion in the case of danger to health, rape, or incest. At least Nixon was a bit more 'liberal' on the subject, he thought they should also be legal in the case of mixed race pregnancies.  
So, do you have proof of your claim regarding all of the Democrats in opposition to civil rights, being in favor of abortion?  



>the sources I shared PROVE the dems were the racist ones and the GOP supporterd the civil rights bills more than the dems. 

Even abiding by your logic, if a majority of Democrats voted in favor of civil rights, how does that make them the real™ racists?

But more importantly, the data I linked, demonstrates that ideology was dictated more on region, than a set party at that time. When those racist Southern Dixiecrats/Democrats resigned, or died, Republicans who shared their ideology were voted in. That gradual shift being mostly thanks to what the RNC Chairman described as the Southern Strategy. The ""inheritance"" you balk at was nothing more than their dogma being passed down from generation to generation, from slavers and their sympathizers, to segregationists, to today.

To discount the above, you'd have to find it a mighty odd coincidence that virtually all Southern Republicans opposed civil rights, while Northern Democrats were heavily in favor. Which I suppose you'd explain away by asserting that for the South and North to have entirely [swapped their political strangleholds](https://media.giphy.com/media/Vd24fs8GVwGZoahXAu/giphy.gif), they all up switched regions with one another?  
You'd need to posit that the RNC Chairman was just making shit up to hurt the Republicans, for reasons.  
Wait, make that two [RNC chairmen](https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/GOP-renounces-60s-racial-strategy-Party-chair-2655173.php).  
That the party of Lincoln(despite Abe not winning a single southern state, another bizarre coincidence I'm sure) celebrate the Confederacy, and wave their flag, ironically.  
Disregard the [Republican ubermensch's](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/ronald-reagans-racist-conversation-richard-nixon/595102/) racism, and opposition to the 1964 CRA, 1965 VRA, and veto of the 1988 CRRA.

We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news.

>Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did,

>You start out in 1954 by saying, “n-word” .By 1968 you can’t say “n-word”—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.… “We want to cut this,” is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than “n-word.”

Lamar finished the year tied for 8th in completion percentage with Russel Wilson, and finished 1st in QBR, and 3rd in rating.  

But sticking with your selective approach of evaluating quarterbacks via poor numbers versus poor pass defenses:  
Ryan had a completion percentage of 50%, and a 59 passer rating against the 30th ranked pass defense in the league.

Can you support your assertion, because I've seen redditors note the paradox of tolerance more than anything.  

And disassociating yourself from someone because of their casual, and unintentional utterance of a naughty word is certainly intolerant itself.

>The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news.

>Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did,

>You start out in 1954 by saying, “n-word” .By 1968 you can’t say “n-word”—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.… “We want to cut this,” is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than “n-word.”

Right, I forgot, tu quoque only exists between the two involved parties, and if anyone else were to acknowledge it, that somehow renders its usage as immaterial.

I said *effectively* state run, meaning congruence with what the President wants to hear.  

>I think you need media outlets that cover both sides and then people can make up their minds. Effectively what you support with your anti Drudge anti Fox stance would be a media that all follows the same ideology - a DNC, “state-run media”.. not sure if you see that?

That's two false dichotomies, as there aren't only both/two sides, and some sort of opposition to Fox & Drudge in one post isn't equivalent to an endorsement of any other side. Plus, if every outlet is spinning their propaganda/lies, how would you ever get the truth? But also, you're the one expressing opposition to Fox & Drudge, in that they supposedly aren't catering to your viewpoints as hard as you'd like. 

As for me, I couldn't care less how their management dictates things, as I don't need or want a media conglomerate to tell me what I want to hear.  
Rest assured, you still have plenty of options for that, whether that's OAN, Sinclair, most of AM radio, Gateway Pundit, Infowars, or a lit Patriot™ broadcasting on youtube from his survivalist bunker/mom's basement."
