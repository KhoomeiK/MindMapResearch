I don't know if you've just enlisted and still have rose tinted glasses on, but they don't have to own it in terms of purchasing it to punish you from using it, enact policy keeping you from it, or enforce existing policy. They can and will do whatever they see fit. If you think the military doesn't have ultimate control over your life and your stuff just because they don't visibly exercise that control on a daily basis, you are sorely mistaken, bud. It's part of the sacrifice of serving. You also give up many of your constitutional rights, like freedom of speech.

They do it all the time. Excellent example is banned foods, supplements, and drugs that aren't illegal in real life and cannot reasonably tested for. 

Like service members are banned from using body lotion with hemp seed oil as an ingredient. It won't pop on a drug test and the only way any one would know is if they saw you using it. Still a banned item and you could face as harsh of a punishment as Captain's Mast or NJP if someone in you command wants to.

OutOfTheLoop,ff49c3s,t1_ff473vp,1579558370.0,"Ah, gotcha. Yeah, it's a product of the cyber-focused world we live in. The wide-open door the Chinese have through Tik Tok is a big deal. Millions of users, many of which are military members, is a real-world security risk. It's not even really about targeted ads, though that certainly comes along with that.

It's like the conflict with Iran after that general was assassinated. People were all about this fire and brimstone situation, and sure there were some rockets fired or whatever, but the general US public doesn't realize how far behind US cyber is. If you browse legitimate federal and military focused magazines and websites like Defense News and Federal News Network you'll see at least an article a week talking about the fading cyber security infrastructure we have. We are coming pretty close to the end of our ability to be able to compete in the new warfighting domain dominated by countries like China that support our adversaries.

Now we're going down a pretty deep rabbit hole, so I won't get too much deeper into it. But I will say one of the reasons we've hit an enormous decline is the current administration really pushes that war is big bomb goes boom and we win, when the reality is much less glamorous."
OutOfTheLoop,ff462t9,t1_ff44kgt,1579556345.0,"Did someone say that? I guess I'm confused because I thought you were being somewhat facetious. If you're being literal, I guess I don't know? I mean, harvesting data, particularly from government and military sources is textbook counterintelligence work. We do it to plenty of other countries every day. I suppose the fear is that we not only handed over the data without a fight, we handed it over legally with video to boot.

China in general is a major military and economic adversary to the United States. They're causing all sorts of shenanigans in the East Pacific keeping the Americans, Australians, Philippines, and other allie's navies and coast guards busy. The Chinese are investing heavily in several African countries, building strong relationships and providing local protection from warlords in exchange for land.

It's worth following the whole situation between us and the Chinese. The geopolitical landscape of the world is ripe for an enormous shift. My bet is we'll be seeing that shift complete in the next 30 years."
OutOfTheLoop,ff43znf,t1_ff41q6z,1579555037.0,"The comment linked in the post explained it very well. Essentially one of the main concerns is that because the app is wholly Chinese owned and hosted, it stores user data within China outside of US/EU jurisdictions. In short, the Chinese don't even need to hack into any systems or data bases to get your info, you're giving it to them willingly. There was other amplifying information in that comment as well.

I commented this part on the parent comment you're replying to, but this is why the Navy and Army have banned the all from government phones and computers. And you may wonder why Tik Tok was ever allowed on a government owned device, and the simple answer is public affairs and recruiting. The military has Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. for official purposes. There's a pretty strong case the connection to China will lead to a blanket ban for service members and dependants on their personal devices."
OutOfTheLoop,ff436gp,t1_ff3dmig,1579554537.0,"That comment and following thread is exactly right. The US Army and Navy has banned the app from being used for on government phones/computers following concerns voiced in the House and Senate regarding cyber security. The other three branches may have followed suit at this point but I'm not sure.

It probably won't be long before all service members and dependants will be banned from it on their personal electronic devices (PEDs) as well.

If anyone is a fan of r/justbootthings you can see how many of the top posts are junior enlisted members doing stupid cringey-ass shit on Tik Tok. Some of them have seen negative action taken by their commands.

I'm not active duty anymore but a fair amount of my close friends still are and many of them have had Tik Tok included in unit-level social media and cyber security training."

Their main reason was healthcare. My parents were cut bad by the ACA, but want true universal healthcare, especially now that they are in declining health as they get older. Hillary wasn't going to do it and they saw Trump as a wildcard outsider that would be a shock to the status quo. 

Then he turned out to be a demented idiot and both of them within the first year of his regime changes panicked about all the dumbass dictator shit in his power trip.

Unlike the previous US engagements in the middle East, which were defined as conflicts against groups of people or individuals and not sovereign nations. 

The bombing of this general is different. It was an assassination as well as a military strike against a serving leader of a sovereign country's armed forces.

Understand I'm not condoning or disapproving of what the US did, just pointing out that this doesn't fit previous molds of us fighting virtually disembodied groups of terrorists or whoever. Or even our track record of overthrowing and occupying a country. Iran is a real nation with a real, trained military and is economically and geopolitically important to the region with strong sovereign allies.

At this point both the United States and Iran have been increasingly raising the stakes on tit-for-tat attacks since the Iran-Nuclear deal was broken by President Trump. 

Maybe there won't be a direct war. But given the situation, there is a real likelyhood of it. 

Although, obviously, the idea is wildly unpopular with service-aged Americans. That could influence how willing Congress would be to approve a declaration of war.

SelfAwarewolves,fcz8awa,t1_fcz242z,1578095694.0,"That's definitely the underlying issue. Trump is a jackpot for the warmongers who want to keep the middle East in turmoil. It goes beyond 42. We watched the Soviets try their luck in Afghanistan throughout the 70s while Vietnam was coming to an end.

An unstable middle East benefits many, many interests. As everyone has pointed out countless times, maintaining control of oil commodities and giving a need to buy and sell weapons and other military goods are prime examples of those interests. Iran is historically geopolitically valuable and that hasn't changed. The depth of war history and the rise and fall of empires is incredibly deep not only in Iran, but in the entire region. 

Going back to Trump, I don't believe he gives two shits about any of that. He's in the business of feeling powerful and living out some sort of twisted despot fantasy. As long as the influencing parties can capitalize on that, he's safe, and a very effective tool. 

Previous presidents were career politicians with background in law, waaaaay more successful as businesses people (the Bush family a main example). Trump is a personality and a brand. He's basically an Instagram influencer who became president. Nothing about him is real or true. He's an expensive wax figure that is currently proving we no longer have checks and balances in the United States. He ordered an act of war without consenting Congress and NOTHING is going to be done about it. Not a single goddamn thing. It's unprecedented and it's the world we live in now.

He has shown that an American president can be openly and bought and sold by foreign powers and domestic corporate terrorists. And here we are. An impeached president with the impunity of a dictator, ordered the assassination of a military leader of a soverign nation based on the advice of people who do not have the interests of the American people or humanity of a whole at heart. Only their massively inflated bank accounts and lust for infinite power."

Republicans are banking on the objective truth that Solemani was a piece of shit to drum up a thin facade supporting military ramp-up and eventual war. Did this guy deserve to die? Yeah, probably. He was a bad dude. Was it a strategic move in terms of putting a stop to the growing attacks and violence on Americans in the country and region? Of course not. Trump touts it as a victory while giving Iran justification for anything they do from this point forward.

Just like pulling troops out of Syria fucked our long-standing allies and made us look so weak, so does this.

I know you were being rhetorical, but I just needed to vent off how unpredictable the situation over there is about to get. If anyone thought it was volatile before, this is a match falling into a powder keg. I hope we are all wrong and it ends up stopping before it's too late."

Just to give you more of an idea of how quick this situation is bubbling over, my wife got out of the Navy about a year ago.

Yes, you are correct, SOME locals were against SOME tree cutting and vegetation removal. Since you neglected to add context, I'll guess I'll do the work for you.

A local environmental group made a grievance about PG&E not providing enough public information on a specific ""base camp"" they set up in advance of potential wildfires. The group alleged that a lack of community involvement and the removal of certain trees and vegetation violated property laws and other environmental policies related to erosion, etc. 

They also allege that there is an alternative to cutting that allows for the electrical wires to be safe while not interfering with environmental growth.

So, in other words, a local environmental group and local officials were concerned about the electric company base camp in their community, the damage to local environment by cutting when there are potential alternatives, and the overall lack of communication and information provided by PG&E."

In any case, I wish you luck. The cloth diaper world is weirdly and unsettlingly cutthroat.

gifs,fcoqm06,t1_fcojecy,1577838941.0,"Move to the American Southeast. My dad built my parent's house by hand on six acres in 1980. It was originally a two-story, four-bed, 1 1/2 bath surrounded by fields and across from a creek.

40 years later he's never stopped improving the property. It's now on the same creek, but with a pond, utility shed, detached two-car garage with a full bar built in it and an area to set up a live band. The house has six bedrooms, 3 1/2 baths, screened in front and back porches, a deck attached to a master bed on the upper floor. All of the field land is now seeded grass. There's a huge flower garden behind the garage and I should have mentioned the freshwater spring.

All that is in a small neighborhood with similar homes and home ages, some are a bit older dating back to the 60s. My parents recently thought of selling, and had the whole package appraised at a whopping $140,000 USD. 

Why you may ask? It's 35 minutes from the nearest city. Every public school in the county is complete garbage. Every hospital within a reasonable driving distance will kill you faster than if you didn't go at all. The only work available is blue collar and most of it is not well compensated. My dad's a welder by trade, machinist by profession and up until recently had been at the same company for 30 years. I don't think he ever made more than 50k/year and his benefits were non-existent.

I bet if you offered my folks $200,000, they'd sell it to you in heartbeat and you'd probably do well out in the country if you know a skill or trade you could use to start a business on the property.

Edit to add: Religious zealots are an issue and are genuinely the worst. The politics are awful and why I'll never move back home after moving away over ten years ago.

But if you can deal with bad healthcare, education, and an astoundingly ignorant political and spiritual community, the cost of living is excellent and the environment is absolutely gorgeous. I'll see pics of my folks having a fire by the creek in summer with all the lush greenery and I momentarily forget about all the bad stuff and can almost smell the honeysuckle and summer rain in the soil."

She finally acknowledged that it's real after we noticed a trend with how the whole house gets sick. First it's one boy, then my daughter, then the other boy, then my wife.
