DuggarsSnark,fcp9zx5,t3_ei7sjx,1577855664.0,"This is such a valid point. I'm an abuse survivor and work with many victims of abuse as an RN- the fear is real for many victims. I'm totally unaware of the Duggar girl's stance on breastfeeding, but many victims of abuse also cannot physically/mentally tolerate breastfeeding due to their trauma."
FundieSnark,fcp8ekr,t3_ei7hzq,1577853941.0,"This is my first time posting ever, I've been a serious lurker for months now. This post is amazing. I hope that I can become a more active member of this sub. I'm still working on the safe spaces concept. Since moving across the country and working in an environment where fundamentalism is open and the ""norm"" I have found myself uncomfortable every damn day. This sub lightens my load.

To all the fundies: feed your children, get an education and for the sake of all things get over yourselves. You don't get to tell me, or my daughter what to do or how to live our lives. Do not look me in the eye and tell me my Jewish faith is my own, then moments later tell me you are praying for my salvation."
