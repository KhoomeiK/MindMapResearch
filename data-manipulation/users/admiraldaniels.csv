dogs,feh6dpf,t1_feedyrd,1579110091.0,"agree as well.  for a dog who loves daycare, awesome let em go.  for dogs who dont, yet still are stuck there those hours, it sucks for everyone involved (their dog, the other dogs, staff).

as a former daycare worker, don't get me started on the dogs who were there 7am-11pm *seven days a week* tho.  like... why even bother having a dog?"
dogs,feeexfl,t1_feed4oi,1579032353.0,"Someone who does paintball explained the entire reason why paintball guns would be idiotic, and it's not just ""it'll hurt the attacking dog."" 
Suggestions were made for alternatives in almost all the other comments, but you're claiming we either let our dogs loose or don't care lmao"

No, we're telling you carrying a paintball gun is idiotic."

SubredditDrama,fd5zr57,t1_fd2xa98,1578183559.0,"Seriously. A few of my hobbies happen to be more male-dominated (which is a bummer since the women who ARE involved in them are amazing, I wish there were more) so my friend group is probably 70/30 split. People outside our group ask if I'm dating/fucking them since we're all super close.  Like no, we just see each other as human beings and value each other as people. Also some of us aren't straight lmao

It does come in handy when we're out partying tho since they're always attentive to any of the girls who can't shake off a creeper and step in as our pretend boyfriends."
