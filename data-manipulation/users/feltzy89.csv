ShouldIbuythisgame,fdhr3mv,t1_fdho72d,1578428521.0,I can actually believe that. 76 was the only fallout game I haven't played because of the horrid reviews and negativity. Could have gotten above average reviews just because us fans wanted another decent fallout game
ShouldIbuythisgame,fdhmpkt,t1_fdhho5u,1578425915.0,"Love westerns, love space, and loved NV. Is it glitchy like the fallout games? How’s the combat feel?"
ShouldIbuythisgame,fdh8ftx,t3_el5zg8,1578417649.0,"Witcher 3 is my go to. I've sank over 65 hours into it and still havent done everything. The main game and the 2 expansions are bundled and very reasonably priced. Great lore, fun combat, beautiful world. You can hop into it without playing the other 2 games"

politics,fd9c2mi,t1_fd6xvw9,1578231349.0,"What do you mean no evidence? How many people would you think needs to die for action? An American contractor was killed, a U.S embassy surrounded by violent protestors. Your hatred of a president goes so far that you’d rather support terrorism?"
legaladvice,fcmyy4s,t3_ei0xj1,1577798149.0,"My wife was hit by a drunk driver 2 days before our wedding. Your friend needs to get in contact with a good lawyer, most lawyers will jump on an opportunity like this. Yes they take 20- 30 percent of the settlement, but the information they provided to us was invaluable. They literally took care of everything for us, to simple stuff to helping plan and organize my wife’s surgery. Tell her to get a hold of the best lawyer she can find because they can help her tremendously"
