progresspics,fekkb84,t1_fekho1y,1579201833.0,"I first started 8ish years ago when i first wanted to lose weight. I went to Groupon and bought cheap interesting sounding sports classes every month. Sucked at badminton and football but fencing was something that I could do even at 100kg because it's not a huge issue if you're not very athletic, you can compensate a little by having quick reflexes and being precise. Besides, the number 1 requirement for a good fencer is good footwork and overweight people tend to have strong legs. I loved it (fun fact, my trainer was also training extras for Game of Thrones to look like they know what they're doing!). Then, I moved and stopped for few years, and once I moved to Switzerland, courses were either expensive or full so it took me few semesters to get a spot in the course at my university. Once that worked out, i started going once per week or twice every 3 weeks, which doesn't really make you progress. Then, 2.5 years ago I met my now-husband and he turned out to be a fencer too! He was way more diligent about trainings than me, so I felt kinda bad being lazy, so I started going twice per week. My trainings were Tue and Fri, his Mon, Wed and Thu.. so we never saw each other :D about a year ago I finally switched to his (very expensive but super nice) club and I have made tremendous progress by going three times per week. A year ago I was still very overweight, but fencing also helped to lose weight, and losing weight made me a better fencer, so it's like magic. It doesn't really feel like working on my fitness in the same way going to the gym does, it is more a fun thing I do with my friends. My first fencing jacket was size 52, my current one is size 38!

If you think you hate sports (like I always did), give fencing a try! Most clubs offer a free trial lesson and cheap beginner courses, and most universities will have a club. The equipment is expensive, so rent whatever you can at the beginning (my club gives you everything for 20 bucks per semester), and buy your stuff once you're sure you like it, starting with a mask :)"

progresspics,fek7zss,t3_epg9cy,1579194514.0,"Hopefully this is not an inappropriate question. Did you know before you started losing weight how attractive you will end up looking? And if you did, did that play a role in deciding to lose weight? If you didn't, do you feel attractive now? Do you think the fact you are so attractive will help you keep the weight off forever?"

Breadit,fcngqxx,t3_ei3ic4,1577811374.0,"Of course! My starter is fed randomly with white or rye flour, white gives a better rise, eye gives better taste. Recipe:
50g rye flour
350g white flour
150g starter
280g water
12g salt

Autolyse flour for 1h. I also add salt at this step, no idea if I am supposed to or not. Sometimes I only wait half an hour.

Dump starter on top of the flour and water. I knead it so that I am trying to always fold edges from underneath over the starter. I like to pretend that this distributes the starter evenly but what do I know :)

I let it rise for 6-8 hours at room temperature, doing some variant of coil fold at least once or twice, usually every hour. Sometimes I don't do it at all, it's still fine.

Then I shape is on a floured surface, creating surface tension on my loaf. Towards the end of shaping I sprinkle some sesame on the surface but I haven't perfected the sesame crust yet. Usually most of the sesame falls off. 

I put it into baneton stitch side up, and ferment. If i have 12ish hours, in the fridge. If not, just at the room temperature. It's good either way. I heat up my oven to 250C and my Le Creuset in it. Once the oven is there, I take the pot out, I put a small square of baking paper on my baneton, flip it over energetically, score it with a razor (careful, but with resolute moves, bread can smell hesitation). Grab the paper underneath the bread and drop the bread in the pot.

I bake covered it at 250 for 45 min. Sometimes I remember to dial down to 230 after 20 min, but usually I dont. Then I uncover it, dial down to 180C and let it bake for 10-15 min more, until nice and brown."
