offmychest,ffrts2h,t3_euup3o,1580165653.0,"Wow. I was going rant about the same thing - I too am also struggling with getting back to the workforce. 

I have an almost three-year resume gap because I was struggling with major depression. While I tried to cover up with some volunteering and online courses, I didn't finish half of them because my depression told me that it is all hopeless. Why bother when I am so stupid, dumb, and worthless? It wasn't worth the effort. On top of that, I relied financially on my parents and stayed in my college town for years. Since I lived close to a huge tech metropolitan, the cost of living skyrocketed. It was the worse feeling to see my college town getting gentrified at every moment while I rotted away. 

A few months back, I decided I had enough. I end it all. I was going to relieve my parents and my sisters the burden of my existence. Unfortunately, the highway patrol officers found me at the brink of a bridge and had me hospitalized. 

After the psychiatric, I was still depressed and suicidal and wondered why I hadn't attempted a second time. I was so worthless, why not just die already? 

I realized that there is a part of me that wanted to live. Despite the constant nagging voices telling me to kill myself, I had to remind myself that I'm still here, fighting against this fucking illness. I'm here with all my imperfections, my anxiety, my depression, my self-doubt. I tell myself that at least I can show up every moment - because that is my victory.

All I'm saying all you got to do is show up. 

Sorry to hear that you are going through such a tough time."
