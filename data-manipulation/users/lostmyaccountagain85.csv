Next can we agree that Republican or Democrat the largest flaw in our system is that in order to get elected all candidates rely on large donations from private interest groups, who in return want something in return if said candidate is elected? Can we go one step further and agree that those same companies are the main advertisers on all 10 or 12 of those same news outlets? Can we go one major step further and acknowledge that much of what q anon was talking about 2 to 3 years ago has come to fruition? All these things taken into account can we agree that even fox news or other traditionally Republican media was against trump until they realised they had to change in order to save their viewer base and thus profit. Maybe you are different I'll admit I do not follow the specifics and instead prefer to look at the big picture. For example of course corporations that are in line or fund the news media will say anything to help their bottom line, in my opinion the fact that the media constantly attacks trump yet cannot substantiate anything to move their best interest of removing him forward is the main reason I trust him. Surely he is not perfect but if the most evil people on the planet who even if you  support care less about you than you an ant want to destroy he must have at least some solid principles. I'm sure you disagree. I'm not a huge trump supporter I didn't vote and probably won't again, but I would be really interested in seeing actual reasons why you take tour stance. I'm always open to admit I'm wrong and change but so anyone I've talked to which is only a few have arguements mostly based on personal emotions or unproven spin.
