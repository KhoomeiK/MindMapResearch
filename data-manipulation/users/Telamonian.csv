AskReddit,ffcot9z,t1_ffc26ue,1579804022.0,"I'm in the same boat. I once took a class where we had seven papers (the seventh paper was supposed to be twice as long as the first six) assigned throughout the semester, but they didn't have due dates, they just had to be in at the end of the semester. I'm a classic procrastinator, and with a week left I had only turned in five papers. One day after class I was talking to my professor and he asked me how the essays were coming along, and I was honest with him. He said: ""You know, I've already graded your first four papers, and if that sixth papers is anything like the last ones, lets just assume you'll get an A. Don't worry about the sixth paper, just write the final one"". Still the best compliment I've ever gotten. And despite that I still hate writing."
LifeProTips,ffajxlu,t1_ffa7isw,1579737588.0,"I can see how someone would believe that though. If the government did your taxes for you, they would have to be completely transparent about every step. Otherwise, the fear would be that you could get a letter from the IRS saying: ""Here's what you owe us. Trust us, we did the math. No reason to double check..."" Some people believe that having some involvement and actually doing your own taxes helps people think about where their money is going and why it's going there. That being said, I think it's entirely possible for someone to bumble through their taxes and not understand it at all anyway."

NatureIsFuckingLit,ff0lx7s,t1_ff0dsdo,1579470134.0,"It's just semantics. They meant that flamingos that don't eat their normal diet would be white (like one born and raised in captivity). The characteristic pink color we associate with them comes from their diet. White is the ""default/base"" color.

It's like carotenemia in humans. You can turn your skin orange by eating a lot of carrots, but a human who doesn't consume a lot of beta-carotene wouldn't normally be orange. It's just that in this case, a *normal* flamingo diet gives it it's pink color."

todayilearned,fd48h83,t1_fd3oeh5,1578165344.0,"Someone who doesn't actively try to engage with their children. Someone who doesn't know what their child likes and dislikes, what's going on with their friends, how they're doing in school. Someone who consistently gives their child bad advice, and who doesn't try to assure them that they can come to them if they need help.

Obviously it's all subjective, and it's a spectrum. Some people are better parents than others and in different ways. But I see parents my age who treat their kids like a pet. They feed them and give them shelter, but are otherwise totally hands off. They're physically there, but not emotionally. And frankly, having a parent like that could still be better than not having one at all. Things could be worse.

I know parents get burnt out. You don't always have time or energy to talk to your kid, or to help them with something. I know sometimes kids don't want to have anything to do with their parents. And there are lots of different parenting styles. There are probably people who would consider me a shitty parent. But as much as I can I try to take interest, I try to listen, to be honest. You're not just raising a child, you're raising the adult that they will become. Just one person's opinion."

politics,fd2yy2m,t1_fd2rkfy,1578153157.0,"This is something that's been bothering me a lot when I read on this subject. Headlines and users everywhere are saying things like ""without authorization/approval/permission"". Say whatever you want about the morality or political implications of this event, but the President *doesn't need* permission. If you're making the case that the President should consult other politicians before making a decision like this, then fine. But they're the Commander-in-chief of the armed forces. They're allowed to order airstrikes, even if the attack will be viewed as an act of war. I don't support Trump. I, in my admittedly very limited knowledge of global politics, think it was an unwise decision. But when we talk about these things let's at least try to understand how the process works."

A lot more women are working, and choosing to have children *and* a career. Guess what - if you and your spouse both have jobs, there's no ""stay at home wife/husband"". You either end up having other people watch them (babysitters or daycare) or you arrange your schedules such that one of you is available to watch the kids. Like I said, I know some shitty dads my age, but they spend a lot of time with their kids because their wives work, get tired from work, and have lives too."

I would tell my son that you get to define your own masculinity. I would tell him not to let others ""take it away"" because that's not something they're capable of doing in the first place. I would tell him: you're allowed to enjoy things that are *stereotypically* considered feminine like cooking, decorating, gardening, clothes shopping, etc., etc.
