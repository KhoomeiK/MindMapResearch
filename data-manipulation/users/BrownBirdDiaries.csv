I don't think she's sexualizing the relationship. I think she's saying boobs are boobs and that she's uncomfortable with the extra ""visability"" they attract when they are bouncing about. 

I know that it makes me uncomfortable when I'm talking to a woman who hasn't a bra on. I'm also not comfortable with a breastfeeding mom who has them out; it's not that I mind breastfeeding, I've done it myself and I'm rather endowed. It just makes me uncomfortable. OP may not realize that the mom has seen brother's eyes glancing out of curiosity. U say this as a mom of a teenage son and a former middle school teacher. 

I am proud of OP for telling mom politely for asking her not to bring it up again. My mom thought it was appropriate to discuss her sex life with me and would not listen when I told her to stop. (Why am I on r/raisedbynarcissists?) 

My daughter told me my ex was watching porn. It messes up a family to involve a child in such discussion. 

Good luck, OP. You sound like a really great kid and mature for your age. Don't take the bra thing personally. The two events are kind of unrelated. And forgive your mom because she's really shaken by what she's been told. She feels a little duped. I can't tell you how it feels to find that out from your kid. It's horrible."

AmItheAsshole,ffc7388,t3_esle02,1579793053.0,"NTA. One dominant thought for bereved parent is the idea that no one will remember their child or thier loss. It reminds me of the orthodox Christian response to someone passing:  Memory Eternal. 

They feel like you are forgetting him. But they have no real constraints on their emotions. They are still raw from their son's death and they will be for years and years to come.

I would explain that there's any number of reasons that you want to go back to your name and I would write them a letter and tell them why you never felt comfortable taking a man's name to begin with-- which might cause more trouble than it's worth.

I remember when I divorced my ex-husband after 18 years of marriage and my little son found out I went to my maiden name. He was very angry that my name did not match his. He Express this in the morning when he found out but that afternoon we had to go through a drive-thru pharmacy and I had to spell my name eight times before they could get it. I turned to him and said, ""See?!?"" And after that it was never an issue again. Point being people get over it.

This is your life, not their son's. They're really not being logical placing their issues about their son's remembrance on you like that. You probably going to get married in the future. Do you really want to go through all that rigmarole to change your name again? If you feel that way now go back to your original name and Shake the Dust of their blame off of you. I know that when I got divorced, my paperwork went through in January and I remarried in December. ( we have been separated for over 15 months by the time the divorce paperwork went through). It felt like a full-time job getting my name change not once but three times in one year. Its total and complete b******* for us women.

OP, this past Christmas I spent three days cooking and only 1/3rd of it was ate by my husband's family. My SIL, who is usually cooler than cool and one of my favorite people ever bought deviled eggs even though I was making them. (They've always been incredibly popular at events and church gatherings). They ate hers and not mine. I was pissed.  Then I realized I was putting energy into the wrong people and I re-strung my expectations and now I know not to go out of my way for them. You were making this a LOT of work. It was unfair of you. But yeah, he was a major brat and you had a right to tell him off for his behavior and your sister is not acknowledging it. This happens with parents. 

So move on. In the end, this whole thing looks like it's about you--at least to most of us here. Check your ego and from now on, only put energy into something you feel people giving you energy to do--if that makes sense.

My daughter--from the age of 12--went to school and anyone who would listen and tell them that I was a horrifically abusive parent. I cherish the time I had with her when she was little and sweet. But now? 

My son is sixteen and he homeschools because he just doesn't do well in public schools--he can't filter out meanness and stay focused. In all honesty--I don't either. I'm a teacher but I work with foreigners because I don't do well there either. 

I love them both but I sometimes wonder if I should have been a mom. Really bothers me that I am fantastic with my students but not so much my own kids when they are difficult. I don't know what to do with my daughter anymore. The last missive was over a year ago and she accused me of the worst abuse imaginable. She's mentally ill and sometimes--what did I do... bringing someone in the world who suffers from something she can't help? (She has a formal diagnosis from a professional).

We are due a settlement from his father’s estate and we spent a lot of time shopping around for someplace else to live. The problem with leaving here is the taxes. We looked at New Hampshire and Vermont and we’re looking at paying three to $400 a month in taxes even if we paid cash for an entire property. As we are both turning 50, it’s pretty hard to justify bringing that kind of daily debt on to ourselves. The hardest thing for me is religion. I moved away for 24 years and spent 13 of them in Memphis eight of those at the greatest church I’ve ever known, St. John’s Orthodox Church. It’s been really tough living in Laurel without an Orthodox church. Most orthodox converts are pretty educated and quite an intellectual lot as a whole. It’s been tough to find anything even remotely like it. And then there’s the fact that I’ve been told at least twice since I’ve been here that I’m going to hell because I’m orthodox, Once by a guy in a tire shop who was explaining the reason he did missions to Romania is because the orthodox aren’t Christians. I pointed out that we covered the plan of salvation at Oral Roberts University so I was pretty much covered.

My husband is not a Christian and it has been mind blowing to him to sit around and watch the people in his family that support Trump.  My own mother stop ped speaking to me for ten months because I got up her nose for being mean to people on my Facebook feed over politics. I still can’t get my mind around the conversation I had with her in which I pointed out he had committed adultery with a porn star.

Yeah, we’d love to leave, but the reality is the cost of living with precipitate me getting a job in public schools and I just can’t even."
SandersForPresident,feyu137,t1_fetcy0b,1579450506.0,It was pretty zen. I liked it because it didn’t try too hard for laughs.
AmItheAsshole,feytvqv,t1_fevy38e,1579450448.0,I like this reply. Totally dig it. The answer was probably a lot of awkward silence.
AmItheAsshole,fevy4xr,t1_feuxnjg,1579403018.0,"I think OP's husband had agreed she would come in beforehand. I think this is on him. The nurse is no dummy--she knew how he was behaving and put him out because he wouldn't listen. I'd say she's NTA simply because the NURSE took charge and made it happen. He 100% set it up by not acting, and the MIL is totally an asshole. Totally."

SandersForPresident,fevwyxr,t1_feuwvdk,1579402517.0,"I know, I know."
AmItheAsshole,fevwrl5,t1_fevl6j7,1579402431.0,"This is a completely valid point. 

But if I say I'm going to pay you and don't, that's just YTA. Period. 

I guess it's which rudeness is right? Maybe this is just two wrongs don't make a right."
AmItheAsshole,feut83y,t1_femudvb,1579389673.0,She egged them and breaded them with Progresso Italian breadcrumbs. They are marvelous. I am in my fifties and I make them just like her.
SandersForPresident,feuswbk,t1_feslky8,1579389624.0,Where you at?
SandersForPresident,feuspyf,t1_fesq35n,1579389568.0,THANKS
