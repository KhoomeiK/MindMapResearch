It helps that there isn’t any bad blood between the teams and fans and also probably that the tickets were VERY expensive. In the end we’re all just cheering for our team, so I’m happy to see something like this."
todayilearned,fe7ubmd,t1_fe6xwb6,1578919348.0,Northern California. The only territory in the country with more issues than us is Southern California. Go figure. Too many grade crossings man.
todayilearned,fe6qbgr,t1_fe6e5d9,1578900420.0,"It’s not the biggest part of our job but it is ever-present. The hardest, I’d say, is being on call every single day. No weekends no holidays no time to relax and disconnect except for your vacation. We’re compensated well and there are certainly worse jobs in the world. I love my job, tbh. It’s fun and unique, and always a good story.....but given the chance for my children, I’d prefer them to stay in school and make a living doing a job where they don’t have to spend every major holiday either working or in a hotel hundreds of miles from home. I’m fully aware I have a great thing going......but now that I have small children I couldn’t tell you how much I’d love to be a coach for my child’s youth sports....but I’ll never have that chance."
todayilearned,fe6q2i3,t1_fe6hb5s,1578900109.0,After my first fatality I saw tendons hanging from a step ladder. I got through it with copious amounts of alcohol for the 3 day period I was allowed to recover...but it’s still just a weird fucked up situation.
todayilearned,fe6pybt,t1_fe6gc3y,1578899961.0,"Depends on where you work man. 13 years in freight I had 1 fatality. I had my first in passenger service my third month. On the west coast we have hundreds, if not a thousand or more, crossings at grade. It’s funny because one guy that came from the east coast said they had 6 grade crossings....we have about 315 on one route alone. It’s all about the variables."

todayilearned,fe6op44,t1_fe6oj8w,1578898431.0,"Man....I can’t speak for everyone but I can say that I absolutely don’t group you in with people who abuse children. I hope you find a good therapist man. Your life. As fucked up as you think it may be, is still worth living, you’re 18 and you have so much ahead of you."
todayilearned,fe6og9w,t1_fe6o7mx,1578898137.0,"Well, you’re aware of your problems and know what you need to do. It’s easy to say “seek therapy” but the truth is you know that you need to speak to someone. Everyone has problems....maybe not all have them quite as severe as you....but you need to see the problem from all sides. You know you have a problem, and you have managed to keep it in control. I don’t think by any stretch you’re a waste of life nor are you a “dead man walking”. You need to speak to someone who can help you gain perspective and keep your problems in check. I’m a blue collar worker, man....and I’m definitely not one who can help you with your problems......but the world is immeasurably better with you in it because you can get help and continue to be the member of society you have been."
todayilearned,fe6ldxl,t1_fe6l085,1578894789.0,"Man, I’m only 2 mins into that video and it brings up an EXCELLENT point. Not just the fatalities, but the injuries involved with someone who survives. It’s not forgiving. Frequently you’ll lose multiple limbs and most likely most bodily function going forward. And for those of us experiencing it...we aren’t robots. We’re human beings in a transit industry trying to pick up the pieces and go home to parent our children and live our lives. Thank you so much for posting this."
todayilearned,fe6l2b7,t1_fe6efr8,1578894459.0,"As someone who’s struck people in that situation.....no ill will man. I cant imagine people who have the, for lack of a better word, courage....to stand in front of a train really consider how it effects others. It’s a terrible thing. There’s a portion of the grief involved that I wish somehow I could have just stopped ahead of time somehow and told this person how much their life meant to the world. On a black and white scale, sure it’s easy to say it’s a selfish act affecting the daily business of hundreds of people, but on a scale of humanity.....-and frankly that’s my priority in life, it’s just a sad thing all around. I hope everyone knows their life is worth living and the world is better with them in it."
todayilearned,fe6jf0b,t1_fe6j8fh,1578892834.0,I hate to say it man but you get used to it. Obviously not the experience of hitting or almost hitting someone...the adrenaline there is crazy....but I live with the idea that any day could be the day I wipe out a family in a SUV. Granted there are many worse things in the world to worry about....but in my little sliver of life that’s my stress. I appreciate your concern man. Thank you.
todayilearned,fe6invj,t1_fe6ierb,1578892117.0,"I’m glad for you man, and I wish I had the ability to do what you do. UP cares about their employees as far as liability goes, but that’s about it. They furlough like nobody’s business and have no loyalty whatsoever. I don’t miss that company. I hired on at 23 and thought I’d retire there, but am glad to have gotten out."
todayilearned,fe6ihv0,t1_fe6i27w,1578891959.0,"It’s a weird thing, man. I sympathize with you and hope you realize that your life is worth living. For us, we’re essentially an offshoot of truck or bus drivers just moving our freight or our people, and then suddenly every once in awhile we experience someone’s death. I’ve told people before that we’re not soldiers or firemen or police....it’s a weird experience for essentially a bus driver to be a part of the end of someone’s life. You never ever forget it, and a large amount of us go out on a medical restriction because we can’t get past it. Just recently an engineer at my work went out on a PTSD restriction because of an incident he had a few years back where he struck a car with a mom and two small children inside.....no survivors. I am fortunate enough to not personally know the weight of that experience but can tell you it’s my worst nightmare."
todayilearned,fe6i6gk,t1_fe6hnql,1578891669.0,Yeah man. I could tell you story after story. A friend of mine struck a young woman jogging down the tracks in the early morning hours in truckee once. The local news and newspapers made a big story out of it and I can tell you....that made it very hard for that man to go back to work. Families of people who are struck usually put up memorials which to them is a symbol of their family member but to those of us that struck them is a grim reminder of one of the worst days of our lives and we pass them every day. It’s rough.
todayilearned,fe6hu2k,t1_fe6h0mn,1578891356.0,"The money blinds you. I gave UP 13 years before I left for a passenger railroad. Essentially you sell your soul for a living income. You work days, nights, weekends, holidays, whatever....you’re always on call and if you don’t answer you get in serious trouble. UP makes it very clear in their initial interview process that you are only a number and will never be more than that. To an extent that’s liberating because you don’t ‘have’ to put effort into working hard, but for those of us with a work ethic it’s demoralizing because they basically tell you that no matter how hard you work, it doesn’t matter. Just shut up, take your call, and show up."
todayilearned,fe6hkny,t1_fe6fo45,1578891122.0,AloneTombstone is right. People running across the tracks or driving around the gates. There are TONS of homeless that hang out along the tracks and for whatever reason they feel it necessary to run and try to beat us instead of just waiting a minute or so. And cars get impatient and drive right in front of us. It’s mind boggling man.
todayilearned,fe6e7lp,t1_fe6d12o,1578888289.0,I carry three different rule books and have to know every bit of over a thousand miles of tracks well enough to run it in the fog when you can’t see anything. It’s definitely a mental job.
todayilearned,fe6dsdk,t1_fe6bo41,1578887953.0,"This is EXACTLY why I don’t have any ill will towards those I’ve hit. If their problems were heavy enough to stand In front of my train and not move, who am I to place anger there. No anger...just sad."
todayilearned,fe6dnj5,t1_fe6asfb,1578887844.0,That’s what it is. The flash of a shadow outside your headlights turns into a person right in front of you. Then boom. They’re gone. And you’re still trying to figure out wtf is going on.
todayilearned,fe6di8l,t1_fe6azpf,1578887728.0,"I’ve been one for 15 years. It isn’t that simple. Be prepared to give your entire life to the job 24/7/365. You’ll work birthdays, holidays, and major sporting events. I’ve had a few fatalities and accidents, but truth is there’s a close call or two almost daily. It’s a great job, but it definitely isn’t something I’d steer my children towards."
