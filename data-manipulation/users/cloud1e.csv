MorbidReality,ffhbd9b,t1_ffh33d6,1579928740.0,It had a few scratches on half of it. Not rifling marks. Bullets break when they hit bone. Not always completely or by a lot but they dont stay that in tact. Through enough soft tissue sure but the first surface being hard its gonna dent and displace some. When it dents a bit it ends up exposing lead. Soft tissue can make lead deposit and if made it through all they said it did and ended up that far away from the original target it must have bounced off bone. If it changed direction its gonna be damaged more than a few scratches on one side. Theres no way that bullet was shot where and how they said and ended up that clean.
MorbidReality,ffh20od,t3_ethocr,1579920979.0,Anything other than a picture of a headline to explain or prove this?

Once it hits bone, even thin bone it starts shedding lead on everything else it hits. Also the way that bullet was found and the lack of scoring on the sides from being fired. None of that seems to add up."

Edit: to clarify. Nobody wants to be a lesser in any way, almost everyone thinks they're smarter than average if you dont just ask then straight up. When they realise they were one of the many idiots doing dumb shit for meaningless friendship instead of learning in class it hits close to home.

At 16 I was functioning at most 21 year olds level. All of my friends were and are consistantly older than me. I've also met 21 year olds dumber than the average 16 year old.

StonerEngineering,ff7gd63,t1_ff7fkyq,1579648920.0,"No, I'm saying common sense and basic logical decision making isnt changed much after you're well into your teen years. Making the choice to waste or not is one a baby can make. The choice of wasting time and resources every day instead of reusing a reusable pipe shouldn't be hard for a 16 year old or a 5 year old. Yes complex decision making and multiple step logic decisions are harder when you're younger but age is negligible. A 4 year locigal difference can be the difference in education of a year. At 16 you should be smart enough to make a one step decision that saves you time and resources with one small change."
StonerEngineering,ff7ex2m,t1_ff7didq,1579647968.0,Near nothing. By the time you're about 13 or 14 you can make decisions based on logic or decisions based on emotion and you know the difference. How often you've been taught to use emotional or logical thought processes determines how you'll mentally work through problems. By 16 common sense should be there and decision making should be a choice on whether to do what makes sense locigally or emotionally. Young people are less likely to use logic over emotion when emotion is present but by 16 you should be well aware of that.Seems like you skipped words where you felt like it
