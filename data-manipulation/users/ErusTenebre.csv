Also, most Americans want Trump removed, most Americans are Democratic or independent, most Americans don't want this shit anymore (like everything that got us here). There's a lot of idiots, but not ""most"" of us."

Donald Trump is, and always will be, impeached.

Whether or not he's removed is the issue at hand right now... He probably won't be, because that's the only way the Right can cling to their last hold on power (probably not really the last, but I like to think that). 

But either way, the fucker is **impeached.**"
politics,ffgv109,t1_ffgqh7p,1579915769.0,"Obama had *nothing* to gain with investigating Donald Trump's campaign and it was worthwhile because it 1) was based on facts and not conspiracies and 2) concluded with people going to prison, during Trump's presidency no less.

There was enough public information to warrant an investigation into Trump himself, though clearly that must not have happened, or we wouldn't be in this unholy mess.

And repeating the phrase ""Russian Collusion Hoax,"" is an excellent pacifier for a brainwashed lunatic, but a complete lie - collusion isn't a crime, and it wasn't a hoax... It should be ""Russian-Trump Conspiracy against Free and Fair Elections."" But that doesn't have a ring to it.

You can tell the moron, they're a moron from me btw. Also you shouldn't argue with them, deprogramming is going to require more effort from people in their life, and you'll just get frustrated."
politics,ffgpzb9,t1_ffgoe8s,1579912108.0,"They don't need to physically go to Ukraine to investigate him. There's a process for running investigations abroad and typically the FBI would seek cooperation with a foreign government's investigation agency in order to do so.

It is not the president's prerogative to investigate a political rival's son for personal gain. If it wasn't for personal gain, he would not have sent his personal lawyer to handle business. He never even attempted to handle this appropriately.

Alternatively, he could have had his Secretary of State, AG w/FBI, and the Ambassador to Ukraine work to investigate this matter. He didn't do that because he knew what he was doing is wrong and needed to be able to easily cover it up (everything would be documented if it weren't through the proper channels. 

If he wanted to go through official, and more aggressive channels he could have gotten his Director of National Intelligence and the CIA to run their own intelligence gathering, or work with Ukraine's intelligence agency to gain information about Burisma.

However, none of this happened because the president has nothing to find. And he knows that. That's why he doesn't care about the investigation - just the announcement of one. He wants to be able to campaign on ""Biden used corruption to gain his son a huge amount of money in a foreign country."" He wants the leader of Ukraine to ""kiss the ring"" because he values personal loyalty (like a mob boss). He wants to appear strong for his ravenous voter base, so he can maintain their rapt attention.

He wants all of this for himself. There are so many public red flags here, one can only imagine how many there must be under wraps.

Also, none of this gets into his unconstitutional withholding of allocated aid/funds headed to Ukraine.

He's guilty AF. And the R's don't care enough to do anything about it."

Go through cantina win some credits (lost all the credits) open up some crates and find out where the prisoners are. Just before opening the door, an Imperial Officer, Jet Troopers, a probe droid and a Death Trooper show up. We open the door to royal guards and elite Tusken raiders. I can't hit anything because the dice hate me. My teammate kills the royal guards with a struggle. I manage to kill the imperial officer, because... that's hard... 

He grabs a hostage, and gets tackled and stunned by IG-88, in that same round, a new imperial officer, an elite imperial officer, and General Sorin show up. General Sorin starts wrecking us with bombardment, but we grab the remaining hostages and begin escorting...

We ended with 0 medpacs, my teammate was 1 hp from wounded, and I was like 3 from defeated. Epic. Awful. Mission 3 was a lot smoother."
