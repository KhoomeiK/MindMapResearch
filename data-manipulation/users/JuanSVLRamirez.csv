You may be completely right. They may be a complete moron. But sullying someone's pride is the best way to fast track yourself onto their shit list. And even if they're a complete idiot nobody, even a nobody can end your career if they complain to the right people."
AskReddit,ffoxd0c,t1_ffnmkn3,1580082975.0,I personally don't have a problem with kids. But I find it in no way shitty to not want that at all. You're allowed to have whatever preferences you want man.

tech,ffflnnt,t1_fff2668,1579886638.0,Not even. We used a laptop and headphones to log in. The only thing I remember is that it used Logitech C920 cameras so the quality of the video was nice. And they kept harping on us to not address the nurse at all. That was probably part of what made it awkward.

civic,ffeepmf,t3_et4cp3,1579845217.0,"Yo. I really recommend just doing a full HID projector swap. They're literally just screw in once you open up the headlight. Otherwise you'll just be blinding everyone with your LED headlights.

In terms of the mirror, look into Broadway. Maybe getting a wider mirror that slaps on top. 

Is it manual or automatic? If it's manual, there are a number of good mods like shift knobs or Acuity shifter.

Bayson R is a good company to look to for lips, side skirts, etc.

Upgrade the horn. Our horns suck. If this is going to be your car to keep forever, then go ahead and go with a hi+low tone horn. Will require some extra wiring.

If you want some awesome brakes, Acura TSX front brakes. Calipers, rotors, pads. They all just slap right on. You'll probably need some larger diameter wheels to fit them. Love the Enkei PF01s personally.

That's all I've got for now."

movies,ffbzr2h,t1_ffbxkou,1579787801.0,Nah. The problem isn’t the power. It’s the story that goes along with it. It’s the character it’s attached to. One of my favorite Superman comics was one where he just talks to a kid for most of it and helps him out. DCEU Superman was a very mopey sad individual. Always looking disappointed like Arrow. I don’t care how often he talks about his S standing for hope. He was emo Superman. And no one wants that.

AskReddit,ffbnlba,t3_esope7,1579774389.0,"There's a place called Cesare's near where I lived. Dad was friends with the owner. Well my dad would always tell him extra extra extra extra extra cheese because he knew how much I loved cheese. Well holy shit, it was too much cheese every time, and I absolutely loved it. I would take a bite and not be able to cut the cheese(har har) with my incisors because there was so much. So I would just have to take another bite, hoping the next bite would somehow give me better results, and that would continue. I would swallow a bite at some point, but since I couldn't actually cut the cheese at all, the cheese would just go down my throat in one long chain. Eventually, I would start choking, and I would have to cough up the cheese and pizza that had gone down. Then I would take all that pre-swallowed pizza and cheese, and eat it again. Unforgettable experience."

Will that work on an NB?

EDIT: Looked it up on my own. Yes, they work for NBs as well for anyone that might be interested."
