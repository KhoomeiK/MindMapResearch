NoStupidQuestions,ffj4gb4,t3_ets2je,1579990144.0,Interesting article from NPR on the history of glasses [here](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/07/07/484835077/what-did-nearsighted-humans-do-before-glasses).
AskReddit,ffgeoyt,t1_ffgck34,1579904564.0,"Statistically speaking suicide rates have remained steady going back as far as 1950 (long before feminism gained any serious traction).  And males have always taken the lions share of suicide by rather large numbers. 
For example in 1950 the rate for males was 21.2 per 100,000 & the rate for females was 5.6 per 100,000. Compare that with 2017 where it was 22.4 for males & 6.1 for females per 100,000. 
If you look at the rates over the course of 66 years the swings have been larger for males with a low of 17.7 in 2000 and a high of 22.4 in 2017. While female suicide hit a low of 4.1 in 2000 with a high of 7.4 in 1970 (which appears to be an anomaly on the chart with the rest of the numbers moving between 4.1 & 6.1).

Suicide rates for both men & women have been slowly & steadily ticking up since the early 2000's.

EDIT: Nevada, a state where gambling & prostitution are legal, ranks # 12 in the United States in suicide with a 2017 rate of 20.25(age adjusted) per 100,000. The are 38 other states without legalized prostitution with lower suicide rates.

Just my opinion, when you're at that low point a short empty visit with a prostitute isn't going to fix things & regular visits are probably only going to accelerate your slide if you're not already there."

TBH I've been considering a vegetarian diet. Or at least a far less meat-centric diet. 
Partly motivated by vegetarian & vegan friends who don't care about what I eat!"

neuroscience,fe5r2gi,t1_fe3biod,1578873343.0,I'd be interested in some reading on vasodilation in half of the body using hypnosis. Has there been a clinical study on this phenomena? A quick Google search didn't yield much.
todayilearned,fdq41kf,t1_fdq2zsq,1578653825.0,"That and a common currency. It's a HUGE advantage when a very high percentage of the population is able to communicate ideas. 
With that said the United States does very little on a national level to teach people a second language during their education. Even though the United States has the second highest number of Spanish speakers in the world & will pass Mexico in the next few decades @ the current pace."
todayilearned,fdq3t6h,t1_fdq30w5,1578653501.0,"Actually Hindi & English are the official languages of India. India has many recognized languages. English becoming one of the official languages is directly related to British colonization of India, not because the people of India thought it was swell."
neuroscience,fdi5nsh,t1_f7bt35o,1578436174.0,"It's nothing more than a manipulation of your attention. Most of the population is in some state of trance daily. Focusing is how we are able to tune out distractions & actually get things done. 
I've been a hypnotist for over 20 years. It's not magic, and it is not that unique. It's also WAY oversold by 'hypnothrapists'. 
Furthermore I think most hypnotherapists are dangerous. Would you go to a doctor who prescribed aspirin for EVERYTHING? Look through some of the online forums, they're cringy. It's an excellent tool for managing anxiety, negative behavior modification, and focus/motivation. It's easier to achieve than you might think & should be structured in such a way so you can use it on your own after learning how to achieve it."

Onision,fcuyrl8,t3_eivswc,1577991203.0,"If anyone was interested in really putting an end to Onision's behavior they should encourage his victims to go to the police in the jurisdiction where the assaults took place & report it. To my knowledge nobody, including Chris Hansen, has done this. Everyone is just parading around forums with posts & YouTube with videos talking about what a dog Onision is. Yeah, we know that. In my opinion Onision is getting exactly what he wants from all of this. It's very unlikely the F.B.I. would give a fuck about a manchild with a short list of victims. They'd just kick into a local jurisdiction & may not have any authority over it to begin with if it wasn't intERstate. It just sounds more exciting when Chris Hansen tells you he's been talking to the F.B.I rather than the Tehachapi PD. He's all about views, too."
