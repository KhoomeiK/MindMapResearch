creepyPMs,ffrzga0,t3_eusg7h,1580169443.0,What the fuck? The lengths that people will go to...
memes,ffnjnvb,t1_ffngkvd,1580066836.0,Same goes to you. Be careful what veggies you eat. A lot are contaminated with pesticides.
memes,ffngfex,t1_ffng33s,1580065606.0,"To be fair, it doesn't even really matter what we eat anymore since most is doused in chemicals and made with artificial shit. Even vegetables. Either way, we're slowly dying and not getting help or having anything fixed, so I'm gonna enjoy a fucking double with crispy bacon."
memes,ffnevfy,t1_ffnc3an,1580065064.0,"I agree. It's one thing if the child has a health condition that causes them not to be able to have stuff like milk and meat. Seems to be a more common thing now. I've met quite a lot of pescatarians who are also lactose intolerant. And these pescatarians aren't eating meat because it physically hurts them to the point they have to get their stomachs pumped. But it's another thing to force something onto your child when they need nourishment. Humans are naturally omnivorous creatures, so while we can live off of just veggies, it's still not entirely healthy."

AskReddit,ffjagjq,t1_ffjaea9,1579994208.0,I'm sure you'll find someone who gives you all the butt touches that you deserve.
AskReddit,ffja6et,t1_ffja3zo,1579994025.0,Haven't gotten a response like this yet! Kinda glad actually. At least I know now that some guys like it.
AskReddit,ffja2gv,t1_ffj9yzf,1579993954.0,"Alright, that's kind of adorable lol."
AskReddit,ffj9wvl,t3_ety4jw,1579993856.0,Should've specified more. It's your significant other and she's doing it as a sign of affection.
AskReddit,ffj9tbd,t1_ffj9j4f,1579993794.0,If it's your significant other I meant.
AskReddit,ffj9qgk,t1_ffj8vlu,1579993744.0,"Make sure your significant other knows that then, because women are prone to grab for butts. Girls like butts too."
AskReddit,ffj9ogs,t1_ffj8vc0,1579993706.0,"Like a love grope. Doesn't have to be sexual, but thanks for the answer lol."
