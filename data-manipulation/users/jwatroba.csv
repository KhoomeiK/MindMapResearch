I also enjoy therapy and I feel like people are getting so much more smarter around alcohol. I’m not going to lie I use cannabis when I need to and it damned near saved my life and helped me get over the hump
stopdrinking,feat56d,t1_fealf5v,1578951980.0,Nothing fun about it
stopdrinking,feaecs2,t3_eo47hl,1578947622.0,I did the same thing. Made it one year and bam right back at it and it wasn’t any easier actually it was worse and the hangovers! I’m 123 days and I will never go back. Day 1 and you should be proud. It’s much easier when you finally admit you can’t drink and just take it off the tables. The cravings are not there. Yeah sure I hate the disease but the only cure is to not drink: guess what my life has never been better. You Can and Will succeed. This time make it for good! Being sober is rad as fuck. I get it I’m only in my 30s and all my girl friends drink. Was awful at first but now I’m a better and happier me. It’s made a huge difference

stopdrinking,fe7l7s4,t1_fe6avxi,1578916062.0,Keep me posted. Deaths are tough. What you do is have to acknowledge the hard times and push yourself. Also it’s ok to have a bad day or 2 or 3. It’s what it is. I do recommend therapy. I wish I did when my brother died. I carried that pain for a very long time. You can do this girl. You are strong even when you feel weak. I’n those moments are sometimes the most precious gifts are to be taught. My heart breaks for you but the inner beast inside prays know realize your self worth and you never look back. Get it girl. Break the cycle
