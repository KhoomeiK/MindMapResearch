With that being said, her view isn't that uncommon when it comes to football. 

For one thing, while you rightly pointed  out that football is a much bigger cultural phenomena outside of the US, the women however, have been spectators for the most part and rarely, if not never, actors. 

In that sense the US women has had a considerable lead over non American women. Take for example Argentina, a country with a rich footballing tradition producing  a few of the world's best footballers and note the lack of support they gave their women's national team. 

I believe there were instances where their Football Federation wouldn't pay for the women lodging thus forcing  them to sleep in the team's bus. 

The point I'm making here is while football is big outside the US, women's football is not. Ironically, it may be harder to open the sports to women in countries with long-standing footballing tradition. 

There are positives to be had though. Europe seems to be catching up with US. The English FA has been promoting the women's league, with my own team now having their women's team being much more visible. 

In the meantime however, the quality of the game will inevitably suffer. More so when we consider that Africa and Asia ( excluding Japan) still have teams which are at best amateurs and that unfortunately shows. 

This lack of competitiveness, especially when compared to male football unfairly diminishes the achievements of the US women. 

On the bright side, seeing how the European teams are progressing, the level of the next world cup will  drastically rise.

In my opinion, women's football is well on its way to become mainstream in the near future. I'm basing this on myself who until last world cup has never watched a game of women's football but  somehow followed the whole word cup."

Imagine if a similar law was passed for Myannamar, it would follow that said law would include all religious minorities but exclude the Buddhist majority. 

With that being, maybe the law could have included provisions for atheists ex muslims, or Muslims who can prove that they are facing persecution for whatever reasons.

With that being said, her view isn't that uncommon when it comes to football. 

For one thing, while you rightly pointed  out that football is a much bigger cultural phenomena outside of the US, the women however, have been spectators for the most part and rarely, if not never, actors. 

In that sense the US women has had a considerable lead over non American women. Take for example Argentina, a country with a rich footballing tradition producing  a few of the world's best footballers and note the lack of support they gave their women's national team. 

I believe there were instances where their Football Federation wouldn't pay for the women lodging thus forcing  them to sleep in the team's bus. 

The point I'm making here is while football is big outside the US, women's football is not. Ironically, it may be harder to open the sports to women in countries with long-standing footballing tradition. 

There are positives to be had though. Europe seems to be catching up with US. The English FA has been promoting the women's league, with my own team now having their women's team being much more visible. 

In the meantime however, the quality of the game will inevitably suffer. More so when we consider that Africa and Asia ( excluding Japan) still have teams which are at best amateurs and that unfortunately shows. 

This lack of competitiveness, especially when compared to male football unfairly diminishes the achievements of the US women. 

On the bright side, seeing how the European teams are progressing, the level of the next world cup will  drastically rise.

In my opinion, women's football is well on its way to become mainstream in the near future. I'm basing this on myself who until last world cup has never watched a game of women's football but  somehow followed the whole word cup."
