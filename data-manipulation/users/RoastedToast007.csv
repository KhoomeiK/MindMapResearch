Did you get an accute mental illness that made you act like this temporarily? Assuming any of this is even true. You’re probably a kid hiding behind his screen"
tifu,ffdhilj,t1_ffdft02,1579820984.0,"That’s odd. I’m not from the US, the milk here is either pasteurized or not pasteurized. The non pasteurized ones are refrigerated and the pasteurized ones are sold on regular shelves. I’ve been told they are both heated, to kill bacteria, but the pasteurized one is heated to a higher degree, so it will last even longer, but it also tastes different because it has been heated more. Now I’m a little confused. 

I also heard that your eggs are only sold refrigerated? Ours are only sold on regular shelves, because egg shells are naturally supposed to not let through bacteria. I think you guys wash off that protective layer of the eggshell or something"
Brogress,ffdge8l,t1_ffddbgj,1579820316.0,"Say person A and B are pretty much clones and have the same amount of muscle mass on them, but the only difference is that person A has more fat and is very overweight. Person A’s caloric intake for a maintenance weight is 4000kcal and person B’s is 2200kcal. If person A were to eat 3500kcal daily, he would be eating in a caloric deficit, and If person B were to eat 2600kcal daily, he would be eating in a surplus. But person A doesn’t actually have to eat more than person B to put on the same amount of muscle, just because he weighs more. 

The caloric surplus rule is really just there for losing and gaining weight. Not specifically losing or gaining muscle."

Dude. They don’t do something to shorten its lifespan, they just don’t pasteurize it. Pasteurizing something extends its lifespan. “Regular” milk is unpasteurized, so it lasts less long"

Water does not absorb less impact at greater speeds, it in fact absorbs much more force, but in return makes you feel that much more of that force as well. The problem with falling in water at great heights is that the water molecules won’t have as much time to disperse away from your body. This is also why belly flops hurt. You come in contact with many more water molecules, but for all the molecules to disperse away from your body, it requires that much more force. And that much more force you will feel."
