todayilearned,feud44b,t1_fetwzxc,1579385396.0,"Yep here in AZ. You’ll see them along side of highways working in groups of like 5 or so chained together. 

Not to mention while in jail it’s considered a “privilege” to be able to join the chain gang. Because they get to leave jail and work for the day. But have even more strict rules to follow. 

It’s so annoying they’ll go stomping and clapping around the jail, in formation, “WE ARE THE CHAIN GANG (stomp, clap, stomp) THE ONLY FEMALE CHAIN GANG” lol embarrassing"

todayilearned,feuaacm,t1_fetv4ku,1579384652.0,"Eww THAT smell.. in AZ jails all the clothing and linens wreak of onions. It’s made even worse from people sweating so much (and being indignant with no deodorant). 
But I’ve heard the reason behind the foul stench is so it’s easier to be tracked by dogs if escaped?"

So different for everyone
Me, personally, I feel like there’s no way I could get to the doctor recommended 12 hours but I’d for sure try to wait as long as possible anyway"
