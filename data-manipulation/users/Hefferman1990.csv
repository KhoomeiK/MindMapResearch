Fallout,ffhgkrs,t3_etlmsd,1579934327.0,"I do like it and would enjoy it infinitely more if it actually worked. The bugs are unforgivable, how this part of the game was okayed to be shipped I'll never understand. Still in 2020, I'll leave my settlements and go to do w/e, check the pipboy and what do you know? My settlement suddenly has 15 extra people no beds, water, food or defense. That shit still happens, and how this game was allowed out of the door with such a huge glaring fuck up in a main component just pisses me off and shows me the level Bethesda actually cares about QA. That bullshit and the atrocious AI path finding and just general stupidity. Other than that I really do like it but if it actually worked I'd probably feel less inclined to shit on this game overall."

fnv,ff7yii0,t1_ff76oxe,1579661396.0,Played so many hours of this game and only on my last playthrough did I find them on complete accident by just exploring north of Vegas. No clue they or Vance's gun even actually existed

It falls over once in awhile and makes a loud bang so thats probably why they're hesitant. And yeah CJ is a cutie. Problem is she knows this and is quite the con artist lol."

darksouls,fewcalo,t3_eqklhk,1579408281.0,"I did it in 3 or 4 attempts with Solaire backing me up. They're def a challenge though, they live up to the hype. Couldn't imagine even trying with out an NPC summon or a fellow player. I haven't been back to that playthrough since, I should really try to beat the game finally. Good luck to you!"

Fallout,fdps8s2,t3_emjpkq,1578638489.0,"So much of FO4 is like this though too. Cool encounters on the surface but ankle high depth. East city downs is another one they could have done a lot more with but didn't. Don't get me wrong I've spent 100s of hours on FO4 and like it, just felt similarly when exploring a lot of the game."

amputee,fcvm161,t3_ej537l,1578004994.0,"I'm no doctor, but I am a fellow amputee that also likes to partake in some herbage. I had my left foot amputated shortly before my first birthday due to a birth defect and very rarely I will experience something similar (29 now just for reference). I personally don't find what I experience to be particularly pleasant, but have noticed it only seems to happen when I smoke/get high, although very rarely. In your case it could be a mix of it being a (fairly) recent amputation and the weed messing with your head. My best guess just from personal experience."
