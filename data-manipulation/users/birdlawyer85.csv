HistoryPorn,fekbhi2,t3_ep9wdv,1579196573.0,wow!
SpaceXLounge,feifamy,t3_ep4k7c,1579137179.0,1:07 is epic. It's actually quite spacious.
aznidentity,fehlqd9,t1_feh86jp,1579119105.0,"Regarding your 3rd point, can I go to China and complain that Chinese people hold all societal power? HELLO? The US was founded and built by Anglo-Saxons. It is their country. Therefore, yes, they will have the levers of power. Just like Chinese have the levers of power in China. You sound like a low IQ individual with a giant chip on your shoulder + deep insecurities."

todayilearned,fegocoq,t1_fegf11v,1579098644.0,Yup. Same with Elon (Musk). Company name is Ambrosia.
HongKong,fegm7yc,t3_eow4q4,1579097030.0,Taiwan should just dump Chinese and only use English. It will shift the culture and will have zero chance from being part of the CCP.
HongKong,fee6oug,t3_eo4h5q,1579027518.0,"The guy looks unconscious. The ''police'' probably beat him unconscious or something then threw him off the building. If that's the case, then you know that the HK Police and CCP are at war with Hong Kong people. This is beyond animalistic behavior."
SpaceXLounge,fe9ov0a,t1_fe9dhhn,1578940125.0,This. You can't just photograph people without their consent. Only a creep weirdo loser would do that.
SpaceXLounge,fe8ribk,t3_eo2cwz,1578929728.0,"Well that's creepy. For sure don't take pictures of random people. Even if you covered their face, it's creepy as f*ck."
SpaceXLounge,fe6mfcz,t3_enl9h3,1578895883.0,He is just an insecure guy trying to get laid. That's why he paid $100 million for that painting that looks like it was made by a teenager. His life is about virtue signaling. He is obsessively seeking approval by spending hundreds of millions of dollars.
todayilearned,fdrzp8z,t1_fdqnu7i,1578692157.0,''The thrill of spying on people''. We call those people losers. It's so weird that people are obsessed with other people's lives but not with theirs. So creepy.
HongKong,fdnebu0,t3_elwne7,1578583985.0,Simply write down where they are and spray paint them all at once. Should be done within 30 seconds.

Starlink,fdliu11,t1_fdlbyj6,1578524969.0,"Elon only makes products that are an order of magnitude (i.e. 10x) better. Speed wise, I doubt he'll be able to offer 10x the speed but he could do 10x the price. $10 a month is recurring revenue from millions of people is billions of dollars a year in net revenue. Not sure why people down vote me."

todayilearned,fde09yq,t3_ektb9t,1578328250.0,That's cool but we should focus on the oceans and phytoplankton as they produce 50% to 85% of Earth's oxygen. There has to be an effort made to reduce the population. It's the root cause of all our environmental problems.

Firefighting,fcus0i3,t1_fcurtfl,1577987325.0,"I read (Slate article) that human muscles smell like beef, and human fat smells like pork. The awful smell comes from burning blood and organs. Also, how ''fresh'' the body is. If it's a bloater, then the smell is awful when burnt."

SpaceXMasterrace,fcad643,t1_fca5oo3,1577567153.0,"The 737 MAX has a SINGLE point of failure: MCAS relies on ONE Angle of Attack sensor. If AoA is faulty = airplane crashes.
