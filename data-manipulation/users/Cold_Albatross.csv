Schizoid,ffgdarb,t3_etaa5p,1579903690.0,"Wow, that's a bunch of questions.

>Do you all have complete absence of desire to talk to people

Yes. Except when I'm in an acute suicidal or acute existential crisis. Then I would want to talk to someone. Even though I'd know talking doesn't solve any problems but venting could help a little in such situations. 

 >or do anything with people

No desire here. 

>and are you always have been like that? 

Yes. I can't remember much but I was told decades later by the kindergarten teacher that I was solitary even back in kindergarden. Most of the time I stayed indoor and did something like excessive drawing when the others played outside. (My interpretation here: I did this just to avoid other children. I don't think I enjoyed drawing but it was the lesser evil.) 

>Do you have friends

Currently no but I'm completely fine with that. I had some good ""friends"" or rather acquaintances in the past. They were kind of reliable/trustworthy. 

>or girlfriend

no and I don't want. 

>Don't you feel lonely?

In my case all this notfeeling stuff is related to lack of emotional empathy. When I'm in danger emptiness always works as a protection. But most of the time I'm not in danger and nothing happens for me, so I don't feel.

THIS! But most times I do or want to do this my social anxiety is still in the background and screaming at me: ""NO FUCK YOU. YOU CAN'T LET THEM SEE WHAT AN ASSHOLE YOU TRULY ARE.

>unless you actually do something to make other dislike you

I'm myself. That's reason enough for others. Means I look bitter, serious, angry or depressed. Apparently, society thinks young people shouldn't already look bitter.

And if I would smile at the employee that would mean for the layman that I don't have depression anymore and I'm just too lazy or don't want to have a job. 

Then there's another reason - I seek help from them but I don't get better. Which is like a slap in the face for them. It frustrates them, they get disappointed or angry. 

>negative self image

I neither hate or like myself. I'm just there, getting feedback from others (doctors and all people who have to deal with me).

I'm diagnosed with depression.

>know how much negative self image and depression are linked, it's just the experience of depression isn't always as clear as what is typical of it due to the pervasity of it.

If I don't fake being normal other people would agree with me that I suck at being a human. 

That means my experience is actually true.

I'd like to feel nothing in situations like these. Most of the time I feel (more or less comfortably) nothing. Makes me wonder why I don't feel emptiness when actually needed. 

In my case all this notfeeling stuff is related to lack of emotional empathy. When I'm in danger emptiness always works as a protection. But most of the time I'm not in danger and nothing happens for me, so I don't feel. 

It's these little incidents that can hurt me. Emptiness doesn't work there (yet?)

THIS! But most times I do or want to do this my social anxiety is still in the background and screaming at me: ""NO FUCK YOU. YOU CAN'T LET THEM SEE WHAT AN ASSHOLE YOU TRULY ARE. There's still a chance that you can stop/prevent them from disliking you if you behave normal, well, friendly. It's all about prevention.""

>unless you actually do something to make other dislike you

I'm myself. That's reason enough for others. Means I look bitter, serious, angry or depressed. Apparently, society thinks young people shouldn't already look bitter.

And if I would smile at the employee that would mean for the layman that I don't have depression anymore and I'm just too lazy or don't want to have a job. 

Then there's another reason - I seek help from them but I don't get better. Which is like a slap in the face for them. It frustrates them, they get disappointed or angry. 

>negative self image

I neither hate or like myself. I'm just there, getting feedback from others (doctors and all people who have to deal with me).

I'm diagnosed with depression.

>know how much negative self image and depression are linked, it's just the experience of depression isn't always as clear as what is typical of it due to the pervasity of it.

If I don't fake being normal other people would agree with me that I suck at being a human. 

That means my experience is actually true.
