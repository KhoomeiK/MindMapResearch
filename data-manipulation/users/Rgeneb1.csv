I'd had enough, I didn't want to go on, not start drinking again, I didn't see the point in life. I was unloading all this to a friend and he told me ""It does get better but first, sometimes it gets worse"".

He was right, addiction had ruled my life for so may years I knew nothing else. There was a bleak void I had no idea how to deal with and that was compounded by my physical withdrawals - it's estimated it can take 2 years before brain chemistry of an alcoholic has returned to ""normal"". As time went on, things got better. Much better. But for a time they got worse. Stick with it, life with start to fill the emptiness you're feeling before you know it.

NoStupidQuestions,ffezayz,t3_et6mos,1579871185.0,"Depends why you're writing. If it's for a reddit comment then, no offense, but it comes across overly cautious, like you're feeling your way through the sentence as you type, not knowing where it will end. It doesn't scan easy and I don't believe most readers will get your full meaning because of that.

However, if you're honing your craft, developing your skills as a creative writer, then go with it until it either works for you or starts to annoy the hell out of you and your readers. Proust famously loved his run on sentences, lots of commas in his 600+ word sentences, and his stream of consciousness worked amazingly in that style. Faulkner also but for me that's not such a great example as I struggle to follow much of his writing.

Typing this comment has also reminded me that I've had Coe's ""The Rotters Club"" on my reading list for far too long, famous for it's over 13000 word sentence. I do hope he uses lots of commas there."

alcoholism,ff8inkb,t1_ff826y0,1579680232.0,"The first thing to do is get sober. If you couldn't identify and deal with it before you started drinking you definitely can't after. After that it's looking at how you live your life to determine what you can do to improve it. in AA that's made simple (not easy) by working the steps which will get you to look at yourself with honesty and humility. You might never ""fix"" the problem but few people who have reached the stage of looking at subs like this one can say that alcohol is making it any better. In my case I can say the many problems I was dealing with or hiding from using alcohol were amplified dramatically or even caused by my drinking. Addiction itself was always my problem, my other problems were excuses for my addiction."
alcoholism,ff7907e,t1_ff740nd,1579643567.0,"The AA Big book does mention the allergic reaction but my understanding is that's more of a metaphor than an actual diagnosis. If you're allergic to peanuts, you don't eat them or they kill you. If you're an alcoholic then don't drink alcohol because it will kill you. I'm a big fan of AA but it's important to remember that much of the literature was written in the 1930s-1950s and as such the terminology, medical and otherwise, can be rather dated.

In answer to your last sentence, AA can be very religious if you want it to be. The majority of members I know tend to brush over the religion, a Serenity prayer is just a positive affirmation by another name. Don't let fear of religion put you off a unique and possibly life saving program."

They instantly became people I was afraid of (who else were they talking to?) and if their names came up in conversation with others I painted them as meddling gossips. They were no longer friends, they were people to avoid.

Looking back in sobriety I owe those people some amends, they were kind and trying to help. I owe them gratitude not hatred.

Over the years many others covered for my drinking, or ignored it, avoided me so they didnt have to deal with it. I still got fired eventually. They werent helping me, just delaying the inevitable.

IIf I was in your position today I would speak to the guy make it clear that his safety, and his coworkers, is at risk. I'd tell him I'd take it further if he didn't change. I'd expect him to call me a cunt and then up his game when he's trying to hide his drinking. I wouldn't expect him to stop. He can't control his drinking, you certainly can't do it for him, all you can do is mitigate the risks at work.
