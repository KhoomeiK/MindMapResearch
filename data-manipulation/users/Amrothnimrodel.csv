NoStupidQuestions,fedt820,t3_eon4mo,1579019386.0,"Not having been out of the US, I would think the big thing is the wait time. In the US, if you have good health care, you get in fast. The expense is still high but a good plan usually pays eighty percent and you pay twenty after the copays. Copays range wildly depending on your plan inhale had onset that are 1,200, 2,000, and 5,000 and up. Most of time, by the time you pay the copays the year is up and you have to start over. Surgery's are often pushed to the end of the year because of this and then it's hard to get in. This in my personal opinion is the best case. What I would like to know is that if universal healthcare actually works. Are peo pl le able to get solid health care or not? Do I have to wait for months to see a doctor or specialist?"
