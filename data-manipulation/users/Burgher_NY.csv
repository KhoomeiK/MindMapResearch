OddlyArousing,ffduqv0,t3_estfqu,1579829417.0,"What happens when it stops “moving.”

Is it just like all of the ice melting in water or like many metals melted together?  Is there a word for it like “equilibrium?”"
dogswithjobs,ffduiiz,t3_esrgot,1579829254.0,Not surprised.  Doesn’t take much to get a degree from Clarkson other than being a warm body with funding.

Seriously though, elephant has some serious vascularity. That pre-workout is really working."
politics,ffds8nq,t1_ffdr5ym,1579827637.0,"I’m not for open war. 

I’m for murdering the progeny of the billionaire class.  Indiscriminately and publicly.  These people only care about their legacy.  So fuck with that.  Killing a billionaire is too hard.  But it’s probably not that hard to make a gruesome public statement with a child who is related to a billionaire who is wondering if they want to do coke at Harvard or Princeton next year."
worldnews,ffdqwn4,t1_ffcsjrt,1579826761.0,"I want the lead singer to do that thing where they basically say _guitar_ or _play it, Stevie_ 

But instead 1988-1992 era James Hettfield just says _100 seconds to doomsday-ah_ and then I launch into a blistering guitar solo."
powerwashingporn,ff94bh4,t3_esbr9o,1579704518.0,"Wait wait wait.  

Is there a yard work/house work simulator that uses Mario characters, mechanics and toys?  I would really be into that."
pics,ff7j5t5,t1_ff7hwa8,1579650785.0,I had a really nice pair I got as gift in HS that “I would grow into.”  Never quite did.  One size too big and they looked like clown shoes on me.

Remember that farm we sent your old dog to upstate so he had room to play?  That’s where Ozzy is headed."

dogswithjobs,ff5y5bx,t3_ert2sd,1579614051.0,I like how he told that white van what fer when it blew through the crosswalk loaded with children.
AskDocs,ff5xz28,t1_ff5scn6,1579613906.0,...can you elaborate on why you said this...?
instantbarbarians,ff5x7ek,t3_erqbmr,1579613239.0,Go Niners.  Stay faithful.
FoodPorn,ff530p9,t1_ff4yxk5,1579578845.0,Yeah you’d think that.  We get mixed bags and they’re usually fucking small as shit.  Maybe a couple big boys but usually they’re smaller than above.
FoodPorn,ff4nbwi,t1_ff4fhgh,1579567788.0,I was thinking restaurant prep and presentation.  You could easily bang this project in less than an hour from plastic bag squid to table.
explainlikeimfive,ff4apde,t1_ff4abu0,1579559231.0,"...cocaine is frequently “washed” to removed impurities. 

Cocaine makes you have to shit from the stimulation _not_ because it is cut with laxative.  Think about having a real strong cup of coffee then getting stuck in traffic.  

Opening up a bag of fire cocaine makes the entire room smell like a gas station/nail salon. 

Smelling acetone makes me have to shit."
FoodPorn,ff484ys,t1_ff47f2e,1579557619.0,"Dude doing 10lbs of squidbillies is an epic project.  One our two sure, but 10lbs takes up a significant chunk of a shift."
FoodPorn,ff47qty,t1_ff3zoxy,1579557377.0,"I just started working with this at my new gig and was wondering the same thing.  The only thing I can think was that it was cleaned and dressed out (goop, head, beak, the pincer tentacles, and skin, removed).  Then grilled off as separates (body and wings together) and tentacles, and then arranged back in to itself to look appealing.)"
TheSimpsons,ff47bp8,t1_ff36yzj,1579557121.0,“Scene missing” became a frequent reference when talking to my buddies about what happened after happy hour when I was a younger man.
explainlikeimfive,ff46j3t,t1_ff4451u,1579556626.0,I can’t smell acetone without having a Pavlovian response to take a shit.
politics,ff41xl3,t1_ff3oarq,1579553767.0,"I agree.  And some of the words can be a tad confusing and don’t mean exactly what the lay person thinks they mean.  Words like “reasonable” comes to mind. 

If you can’t make heads or tails of the absolute basics of the thing is another thing entirely.  I’m guessing he understands about as much of the document as a precocious elementary school student “it is the thing that lays out the rules for what the government can and can’t do, how they go about doing that work, and how to settle disagreements. 

On second thought...not sure if dude is even there yet."
relationship_advice,ff1ossk,t1_ff1jjax,1579482851.0,Oh yeah. More than once. Then also refused to take my shit seriously and laughed at me because I’m an average build dude and she was 100lbs of drunk fury.
relationship_advice,ff0ox44,t1_ff0fxiu,1579470878.0,"I walked my ass to the police station 3 times to make sure I didn’t get arrested because she was screaming bloody murder and smashing shot.  Second time I was told next time this happens you’re getting arrested.

Third time she started hitting my dog closed fisted in the face (pit bull) and he was just so shocked that I had to walk us both down to the station again.  Thankfully, after not being free to leave for a time, we both got to go home.  But I was like dude...I’m here trying to not murder this bitch for PUNCHING MY DOG and breaking shit 3 times hammered drunk and I’m the one in trouble?"

aww,fep6g1e,t1_fep5y98,1579313193.0,"Reproducing is literally the only way someone can contribute to society.  I think of society like a collective, ant, borg, kale, cow, human.  Tell me all you want about art and music, or grass, or whatever but the end game is pass that goop on and keep rolling the dice.  

What happens 1000x years from now sounds a lot like a “your” kind of problem to me."
