Wow a whole one person switched their entire diet so SOY BAD

>according to this study (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14681200?dopt=Abstract) it is a strong anti androgen, and binds dihydrotestosterone 

Oh shit a 7 day study on rats! Animal trials are nice to start but they are superceded by human studies. They're used as a pointer. When there's examples of human data and rat data guess which wins out?

>Men who eat the most amount of soy have the lowest sperm count (https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/23/11/2584/2913898)

Yes this is literally the fertility study I mentioned above. It's from a fertility clinic with 99 people ALREADY experiencing fertility issues. 75% of whom were overweight. Before the study 10% already had incredibly low sperm counts. You can even see there isn't a straight correlation of more soy=lower sperm count. Fuck, they literally reference another study that gives you the opposite results to theirs:

>Only two studies have previously examined the relation between soy food or isoflavone intake and semen quality parameters in humans. Mitchell et al. (2001) evaluated the reproductive effects of daily supplementation with 40 mg of isoflavones for 2 months among 14 young men. There were no appreciable changes in semen quality parameters or reproductive hormone levels compared with pre-supplementation levels (Mitchell et al., 2001). However, the lack of a control group and the small size of the study make difficult the interpretation of their findings. In a study with a design similar to ours, Song et al. investigated the relationship between isoflavone intake and semen quality in a group of 48 men with abnormal semen parameters and 10 men with normal semen parameters. In contrast with our results, they found that isoflavone intake was positively related to sperm count and motility and inversely related to sperm DNA damage (Song et al., 2006).

Why is the Song study not valid but the fertility clinic one is? It should go without saying that a study of 99 people isn't enough to make a judgement on. Don't worry though, the study says that itself anyway:

>The clinical significance of these findings remains to be determined. Owing to the scarcity of human data in this area, it is very important that this issue is examined further, ideally in randomized trials.

Your source is literally saying ""don't use me as a source!"" for the thing you're using it as a source for!

On the other hand [here's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/19524224/)  a study that looked at 32 reports that used 36 treatment groups (of humans) and found no effect.

So yes, if you ignore the majority of studies and focus on 99 people who already couldn't conceive, rats, and a study of one guy soy totally destroys you! The anti-soy stuff is just cherry picking largely flawed studies while ignoring the bulk of research on the subject."
