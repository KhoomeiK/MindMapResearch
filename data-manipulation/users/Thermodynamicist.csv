politics,ffispyb,t1_ffimezw,1579981763.0,"> As of 2011, only 4.7% of the population lives until the age of 90

Statistically this is the wrong way to look at the problem because Bernie is already 78.

You need to ask ""what percentage of people who live to the age of 78 go on to live to the age of 90?"", or ""what is the life expectancy of 78 year old men?"" if you prefer. 

A brief internet search suggests that [the life expectancy of 78 year old men is almost 10 years on average](https://www.annuityadvantage.com/resources/life-expectancy-tables/). 

As such, the chances of Bernie making it to 90 are much greater than the 4.7% figure you quote."

Given the description of the system provided in the article, yes, I can:

>The drive units contain at least three distinct pieces of hardware that all simultaneously crosscheck any pedal input. The pedal hardware itself contains two independent sensors that must agree as well. This way, only a genuine pedal input will cause torque to be commanded. There are additional crosschecks of this in other modules as well, such as the ABS.

This is basically a recipe. If all the sensors give a spurious reading which looks like a pedal input then unintended acceleration would result. Of course, if this happens, the chances are that the logs won't know that the acceleration was unintended. 

This is not *impossible*, but it is likely to be extremely improbable."

At this level of improbability we can be talking about a car leaving the factory with a very particular combination of build faults, combined with perhaps a faulty software update and a lightning strike, or a cosmic ray flipping a bit or ten somewhere crucial.

teslamotors,ff8zhr4,t1_ff8wsng,1579700926.0,"10^-9 per operating hour is a pretty robust standard. 

There are 8760 hours in a year, so this implies one event should be expected every 114,115 operating years. 

Cars are parked about 90% of the time, so you'd expect about one event every million ownership years if this standard was achieved.

At mass market scales, extremely improbable events will happen in the wild from time to time. 

For this reason, it is more sensible to think in terms of probability than to say that something is outright impossible.
