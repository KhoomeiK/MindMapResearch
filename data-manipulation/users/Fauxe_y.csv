EntitledBitch,ff978gq,t1_ff9714i,1579706473.0,Aaahhh okay well that explains the confusion!! Yeah that model of Merc definitely has a pretty hefty central dash and separate front seats and no way is a larger lady manoeuvring herself across that!
EntitledBitch,ff96q0b,t1_ff96itj,1579706140.0,I clocked that too; serious and gallant restraint on OP’s part ahaha!!
childfree,ff96m6z,t1_ff966u7,1579706069.0,"Yep, really common for the pill to cause all sorts of changes and infections. Yours sound awful though, I’m so sorry you had to go through that :( 

It suck that your average dr won’t warn you about the horrible side effects though :( My new doctor is a gem and together we have found a pill that works for me, but the amount of drs that don’t care/don’t understand is wild."
EntitledBitch,ff96cko,t1_ff961ir,1579705892.0,"Well I don’t know how big these ladies are, but there’s a guy in my office who is huge, but drives a little sports car. He can *just* about fits in the driver side door but has to like swing himself in, already in a seated position, if you see what I mean? If you’re that big there is no way you’re manoeuvring yourself sideways from one seat to the next - especially as you’d have to lift your legs and contort to avoid the central dash-panel. 

I hope this makes sense ahaha."
EntitledBitch,ff95ppn,t1_ff95arm,1579705463.0,I think OP is politely trying to say that the ladies were too fat to climb through.
childfree,ff93yyw,t1_ff93sk1,1579704278.0,"No worries ha. 

It’s a side effect I wish more people would talk about because it’s such a stigmatised thing to talk about which leads loads of women and girls to suffer this fucking infection without even realising it’s the pills that’s causing it! Also lots of people (like your good self) don’t realise your little pill that goes in your mouth can cause such havoc in your lady garden!!"
childfree,ff93pfj,t1_ff93fdg,1579704090.0,"Well the birth control pills went into my mouth. The thrush was in my lady parts. 

Birth control can definitely do that as it messes with all your hormones that can affect your system down there. It’s not fun and actually a surprisingly common side effect (which is rarely talked about because who wants to talk about that with their friends, amirite)."

I went home and cried to my SO that I was too fat, too out of shape, too un-coordinated to dance. He told me to pull myself together (kindly, I respond well to tough love) and give the 'beginner' class a go the next week.

The beginner class was perfect; I go every week, I am getting really proficient in the steps, have lost weight and have made friends! I am even looking to move up to the harder class again soon.

My partner and I aren't married, but we have life insurance which says if either of us dies, the insurance will pay out to the other one (as long as we didn't murder them... which was a hilarious yet sobering clause when I read it). Anyway, if we both die at the same time, the insurance just fizzles as there would be no living beneficiaries to collect it."

fatlogic,fdqlws4,t3_ems7pb,1578669797.0,"Okay, so I have been scrolling through the HAES tag in Instagram out of morbid curiosity and I'm shocked at how many normal-weight folks are espousing HAES, and then plus size folks are agreeing... it seems jarring and potentially harmful**.** There seemed to be 5 bloggers in general who kept popping up and catching my eye specifically. They were all 'thin' by FA and HAES standards. 3 I would say on the 'normal/overweight' BMI cusp and 2 definitely well within the 'normal' BMI limit.

They were all talking about being 'anti-diet culture' and 'pro-intuitive eating' and 'giving your body what it needs, whenever it needs, including junk food'... which is fine, right, it's their blog and they are allowed to be anti-these things. What really bothered me is the many overweight folks who were commenting on their posts, saying how great it was that someone understood, how they wished all people got it like they did, how they were going to follow what these bloggers were saying.

Which is all fine. Until you realise, these bloggers CAN eat pizza without dying, they can intuitively eat and 'cancel' diet culture, because on the whole their weight was not about to kill them. These women (all 5 were female) are all low risk from obesity-related problems because none of them were obese, and yet their obese followers were lapping it up.

No shade at the bloggers or their followers, I guess I just find it stressful when a normal-BMI woman says she is going to eat as much pizza as it takes to make her feel full, and then her 300lb follower congratulates her and says she is going to do the same thing. Seems very risky to the followers, whilst being very low risk to the bloggers."
