Ohm's law does not hold up. 
These are examples where ohm's law and even impedance  calculations do not work.  My point is proven.  The impedance  calculations are even a workaround to still be able to use ohm's law.

electricians,fey3rr2,t1_femv8rr,1579440430.0,"You might wanne check into switched power supply's..  

Another example : according to your statement if you have a LC network parallel  you can calculate an equivalent impedance for it.  
If you would  apply a pulse over it you would just measure a pulse. 

However if you do this in real life you will get a resonating sinewave that decays slowly  depending on the resistive losses in the network. 
Ohm's law is a simplification that only works in certain settings. 

If you are still not convinced what about induction losses and unwanted inductions?
And you can make an equivalent impedance resistance for every setpoint of a reactive  network  but it is an equivalent thing,  only valid in that certain settings (for example transformers and motors change impedance depending on load). 

Reality has more to it then that.

Edit: you can measure capacitance by the charging rate( voltage) ,  google  capacitance,  tau,  and such. 

Same goes for inductance and current."
electricians,fey1qr6,t1_feniye1,1579439657.0,"The angle is the phaseshift yes. 
And you can represent a network with a calculated equivalent impedance to apply ohm's  law yes.  But that's a workaround kinda.  Still useful but still not the complete picture.  

For example you have a LC parallel circuit and you apply a pulse. 
You will get a resonating sinewave as output. If you just use your law this results in a pulse with possible phaseshift. 

I understand the calculations and they simplify things in certain settings.  Even the analogy with water is pretty good( can mimic capacity and inductivity,  even semiconductors)  but it's a simplified way of representing it."
