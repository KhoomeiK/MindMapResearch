bugbites,fdtud3w,t1_fdttpdr,1578722345.0,I’m not in any way am expert but the internet has some pretty good info resources. I would also recommend looking into other reddit threads where people have dealt with bedbugs there’s a lot of good advice there

Sometimes people have starved ones in areas where they don’t really sleep often otherwise bites aren’t usually this extensive.

But most of all don’t let it drive you nuts make sure you maintain your peace of mind. Staying on top of this will help with that you definitely can take care of them if you’re starting early.

Edit: the reason I’m confident it is bed bugs is because of the size and the fact that bedbugs do three to four bites usually which pest control affectionately calls “breakfast lunch and dinner” and it looks like a few of them"

FuckTheS,fdqs7y6,t1_fdqh6ai,1578673759.0,"That’s a fair response.  I tried to make it clear that I’m aware of the irony in the sense that my own assumptions are qualitatively the same as the assumptions I’m condemning this sub for. 

But I increasingly find that no matter what group you pick a fight with it’s difficult to dislike it as a whole. That said, I’m going to continue to crusade against the commenters that seem to be perpetrators of the aspects of this sub which I dislike. Overall it’s just a fun little feud that doesn’t really have any stakes and doesn’t really hurt anybody so this kinda sates my desire for meaningless conflict.

So in summary, I’m aware that every group is more complex and sophisticated than we do or maybe even *can* suppose, and so with that in mind this seems an acceptable cause to just sort of not worry about that so much."
FuckTheS,fdqgicy,t1_fdq72w3,1578666087.0,"Because I disagree that it’s venting frustration. It’s just a new way to farm karma on the premise that people are afraid of losing karma (which is not why I add /s, I use it so that if someone replies to me they reply to a joke rather than mistaking my meaning thereby making the conversation about explaining for a second time a thing I already could’ve cleared up, and conversation generally drops off after that sort of confrontation. And for a sub that’s so focused on denying they’re afraid of being downvoted, they tend to feel that downvoting naysayers on the sub carries some sort of weight.

The karma argument is the only one I see aside from “afraid of confrontation” and I find both to be incredibly presumptuous and generally incorrect, as confrontation on this site is nothing but tedious, rather than fear-inducing. So I just decided to bring some of that tedium back here because I’m not getting payed enough for a job that’s destroying me physically so I can pay money just to live and so I find some small meaning in fighting this stupid cause because none of this really matters anyway it’s just reddit. I mean I assume half the people on this sub are doing the same thing and the other half are teenagers.

lotrmemes,fdo9cwy,t1_fdnknag,1578601145.0," At the risk of being that guy, I will say that the Bhagavad Gita has some pretty dope philosophy and takes on cause and effect. I have a couple different translations at home and it’s worth the read if you’re interested in that sort of thing. Eastern philosophy has a pretty different flavor to western philosophy and a lot of it is actually useful.

Edit- don’t know why this is getting downvoted. Is it because of reddit’s allergy to anything involving the dirty r word?

Well you can read a religious text without believing it. You’re not somehow tainted by understanding the views of your enemy. And there *are* useful things in the Gita. Even if god is fake or dead or whatever ya please."

Moviesinthemaking,fci4wne,t1_fchu3wf,1577657819.0,"Well the whole point of Hunter is his persona. It doesn’t really stand to take anything out of context with him because his writing carried weight BECAUSE of who he was.

I mean we’re talking about a guy who joined Hell’s Angels as an investigative journalist, released a book about them, and then *got his ass kicked* for it. He had grit and it permeated his whole being- he also had intelligence, and that all carried over into his writing. The man and his writing are inseparable, and if you take either without the other then your perception of the two will suffer for it.

So yes, if someone else wrote it, it would be cringe- but I’m guessing most people haven’t lived the life he has.

“This is not cringe *because* it is Hunter Thompson”
