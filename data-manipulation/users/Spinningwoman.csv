LifeProTips,fgihs8p,t3_eyofz6,1580822037.0,"This is good advice. I got an upper second in my undergraduate degree (the best degree other than a 1st in our system) and was taken aback at how surprised my professors were. I was actually a little disappointed though not surprised not to get a first - not surprised in particular because during finals the professor deliberate switched things up so that something I thought I could get away with not knowing became compulsory.   My bad. They, on the other hand were clearly a bit taken aback that I had done so well. I was a quiet self-motivated student and I think they just hadn’t really noticed me much. If I had talked to them upfront I would probably have got more help and some better strategic advice."

(Not oil - nobody used oil for cooking - olive oil was bought in tiny rancid bottles from the chemist if you had an earwax problem).

Canning,fftb5s5,t1_fftanmm,1580215109.0,My only contact with metal canning st home is through home brewing - there it’s becoming more prevalent but it is a different set of requirements - aluminium cans that cope with internal pressure rather than lined metal cans that can be pressure canned. So I doubt the machines would be comparable.
Canning,fftb0dg,t1_fftanmm,1580214960.0,"I’m not in the US so can’t be much help, but I gather that if you are selling, there are a lot of different state regulations.

LifeProTips,fft6dl6,t1_ffs40ke,1580209459.0,"That usage is way overused though, in a manipulative way. ‘Could you just ignore all the scheduled work you are doing and just do this thing for me that I want to claim is trivial but is mysteriously not trivial enough that I just go and do it myself’.   ‘All I ask is that you just reply to my emails in a timely fashion’ (even when I email you at home in the middle of the night and then have a hissy fit when you haven’t responded by 9am next morning’.

I think it’s nonsense to suggest that Duolingo are ‘frustrated’ by people ‘clogging up’ their services by making the mistakes which are actually part of learning. No need to discuss it further. 

Edited to say, if you argued that Duolingo are using the hearts system to encourage learners to pay more attention *because that might be good for their learning* that would be a reasonable suggestion. But not the idea that they somehow resent ‘wasteful’ use of their app."

duolingo,ffpak49,t1_ffp8py1,1580090257.0,"That makes no sense to me. Why would they say ‘learn well, don’t make mistakes’ to those who use the free app?  Not making mistakes is not a sign of learning well, (and duolingo realise this - if you make mistakes repeatedly it assures you that you are still learning) and it wouldn’t cost any less than making mistakes.

duolingo,ffomhrx,t1_ffogkol,1580079173.0,I suspect that Duolingo has a bit of a problem in that their paid for ‘premium’ is not really any more attractive than the free version. Maybe part of what they are testing is what unpleasant features might encourage people to pay for premium?

Canning,ffnwt02,t1_ffnvb7e,1580071774.0,The closest I’ve done myself was toasting slices of French bread in the oven with a little bit of olive oil to make croutons for a goats cheese starter. I made far too many so I dehydrated them completely dry and nibbled on them for about three weeks. They were great. So I guess you could very lightly butter your toast before dehydrating it.
Canning,ffnw82o,t1_ffnvb7e,1580071531.0,"Toast bread at home and then dehydrate it either in a low oven or a dehydrator if you have one.

I’m sure extracts are a lot better than last time I used them (in the 70’s!) but all-grain is just more fun and more about process which is infinitely tweakable.
