Uploaded my resume to LinkedIn and went to preview, it wasn’t sending my LinkedIn resume but the stuff info from my profile... yeah I deleted my LinkedIn after."
meetme,ff7nmps,t3_ehjlfo,1579653875.0,Selling premium snap. It takes a lot to get banned sometimes and easy to circumvent. Also openly selling drugs or sex.
meetme,ff7ni18,t3_ejno80,1579653783.0,"Seriously make a female profile of a picture of your arm. You’ll probably get 20 messages or more within first day if you post anything at all in discussions.

They probably aren’t click on them."

I used to give my Free monthly prime sub to random people streaming old ass jrpgs with 6 people watching and watch them be super ecstatic."
offmychest,ff55xqj,t3_erg32o,1579581155.0,Been there. Delete her as a contact and any reference of her to help. That is if you were texting her number. That way it will become even harder if you want to contact her.
offmychest,ff2gc64,t3_er8zmq,1579504932.0,I’ve been there. She looks at him through rose colored glasses because he used to hit her and steal her money for drugs. He committed suicide when she broke up with him so she is still have photos of him all over her social media and repost them yearly.
offmychest,fenfebn,t3_eq0mo8,1579283511.0,Apply anyways. Chances are they have a lower number of applicants because people like you don’t apply. When you interview just bring up that you are surprised they called you because you didn’t meet that experience but know the job. Shows you read it and the person doing the hiring probably didn’t even write the post.
videos,fej7mji,t1_fej5udj,1579160308.0,"Straight or bi cause I don’t like penis, even my own. Tif were break up then straight. She gets like a little wet but it’s easier just to use lube. She is very passable where it hasn’t been questioned by my coworkers in sales who are constantly using gay slurs. If they knew then I’d surely know. If this don’t work out I won’t be looking for another trans person or anything. 

Also big pro, I don’t want kids and won’t have to worry about birth control failing.

My girlfriend’s life doesn’t revolve around her being trans and constantly bring it up like her friends do, their Facebook is very in your face about it. I find that annoying so would not date another."
videos,fej77yi,t1_fej6rqw,1579159798.0,Post op like 4-5 years ago. I was hesitant for two reason man hands and gay voice. Guess she had smaller hands before and voice was fine. Her friend has man hands and so do the two other tran people I know.
offmychest,fej5kgc,t3_epacvb,1579157779.0,"Happy birthday. It sucks but seems to me as guys get older we don’t really do birthday stuff as much. I can’t remember the last one of my males friends birthdays. Now when I have a girlfriend they tend to make a big deal of it. 

Now my ritual is to sign up for all the birthdays free stuff months before and then just have a me day driving to different places and eating. Last year Arbys sent me a coupon for a free market fresh sandwich and it had no code on it... so I printed it several times and ate three sandwiches that day at different Arby’s. That was the highlight of my last birthday. I don’t think it was a bad day though, that brisket sandwich was so delicious I had it for lunch, after work and then got another 4 hours later. I hope they send me it again for next months when my birthday is."
videos,feizbwk,t3_epby76,1579151508.0,"My current girlfriend started transitioning at 16 and is 25 now. I would have been super pissed if she kept that from me. Instead it was in her tinder profile that I did not read until we matched. Then I thought about it but she had a Batman tattoo and started chatting me up about Batman so I figured I’d meet up and see. One of her friends is also trans and is open about it when dating too. 

I asked my girlfriend if anything bad came of it being in her profile and she said occasionally she would get a message that said faggot or something along those lines and she would unmatch.

Wouldn’t you rather get that right off the bat and not from some crazy psycho who might hurt you when he finds out later?"
