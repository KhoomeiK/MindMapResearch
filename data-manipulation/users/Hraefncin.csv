But one of the coolest things (imho) is entangling with another person--when two people download into the same brain and they get mixed together. At the point that I've been working on, this is a highly dangerous recreation and leads to the creation of one of the main villains, Legion, who has hundreds of minds downloaded into one body, and he can body jump by downloading into other people. But each individual mind is only a sliver, and it's the most aggressive, most dominant parts, as they are the only parts that were able to survive all the other mind slivers."

There are a lot of reasons someone might praise one sibling for something that they might scold another for: maybe your sister is insecure or timid and you show confidence? Maybe your sister doesn't take criticism well and you take it better normally but they judged it wrong this time.

I don't know your relationship with your parents,  but mention it to them sometime, if you can unemotionally and calmly. Best to get it out in the open--just be aware to try to not sound accusatory. Afterall, we all make mistakes--except for straight A students ;D"

AskHistorians,ff6mifi,t3_erxqgi,1579630366.0,"One of the big reasons was one of infrastructure: first, the Amerindians or Native Americans didn't have a number of technological advantages available to Eurasians, such as iron, horses, spoked wheels and a wide range of domesticated animals for work and food. This meant that Eurasian peoples had a number of advantages that made empire building more likely, such as advanced weapons for war and tools for construction, horses could move messages and armies very quickly compared to running, spoked wheels make moving heavy things ling distances easier, and a variety of domesticated animals ensures that more dietary and labor needs can be met.

All this is a long way to say, armies. Eurasia has had large gatherings for war for a long time, and castles are a really good way to keep enemy armies out. And the Americas have actually had a lot of really cool defensive structures over the years, but they tend to pop up the most in places that have historically been population centers and could field armies. North America doesn't really have the topography typical to a massive population center until European Protestants moved massive numbers into these emptier regions.

Note: Another BIG reason for why there were so few Americans living in the North American Midwest when Protestants showed up, is that they still had not recovered from small pox and other European diseases, though that doesn't really address why a castle culture never arose before Europeans even showed up.

It is also worth noting that, while Protestant Europeans were settling the North American Midwest, the Spanish Catholic and Portuguese Catholic were settling the southern North America all the way south and there were/are castles there.
