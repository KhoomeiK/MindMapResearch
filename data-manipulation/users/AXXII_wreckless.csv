college,ffbzuhz,t3_eslg82,1579787877.0,"I started college in 2013, technically 2012 when you add in the year of jr. college too. But I understand where your coming from. I would see people my age well established in their careers, bought houses and started families. and I’m still chugging along in school. I feel like I have to play catch up in my life constantly to feel up to par. But you get to this point where you’re like screw it, my degree program was hard and that’s why it took so long. (stem) but My roi is gonna be worth it overtime."

AmItheAsshole,ffaxg34,t3_esah8o,1579746740.0,"Now I used to work at a certain Texas fast food chain that boasts about ‘customizing the menu to your heart’s content but even some requests were ridiculous but we still did them. You can’t do that at a McDonald’s!! They are too massive of a company to *not* have the mindset to do that! And if you’re gonna get charged for something that doesn’t come with the product don’t bitch about it. It’s not them making it up it’s the fucking computer. Produce costs money and he needs to pay! and lastly you do not ever send someone else for your food and you have that many of requests. For all of this he could make it at home. Go get the damn food yourself and complain about being charged extra, NTA."
Adulting,ffat0pt,t3_eslmkf,1579743804.0,"It’s a tax credit college students can claim up to four times on their taxes. If you use a tax software like HR Block, it will tell you what amounts from that form to put on your taxes in order to lower your tax bill. In my experience my mom used it on hers so I can’t really speak on if it makes a difference between a measly $200ish refund and a hefty one."
AskReddit,ffa3ikp,t3_esbeba,1579727157.0,Space for families or reserved space for anyone 18 and up. Not airport wise but airlines specifically for child free and one aimed toward families. they already started on this where folks would pay just a little more to get *away* from children.

LifeProTips,ff1q4xj,t3_er47c1,1579483704.0,Ended up going to a concert by myself and it was honestly one of the best times I’ve had! You get to leave whenever tf you want!! Another time is I went out to eat by myself after a day of shopping. Much needed “me dates” I do as much stuff as possible by myself! Live free!!
AmItheAsshole,fez3l3o,t3_eqjazx,1579453567.0,"You want it, you consumed it now you pay. YTA 
Now you know for the future to first off: sample stuff before you buy, in the instances. And second to maybe not buy your friend’s cakes ever again. And lastly, to NEVER tell someone or a service to “surprise me “whenever someone asks for your preferences. You are only asking to be disappointed. Give some guidelines or things that you want to be incorporated into it."
popheads,fey452f,t3_equknh,1579440598.0,No scrubs by TLC. Shame that the single version is not on streaming bc left eye’s family wants to preserve. How else am I going to learn the words.
college,feof56n,t1_feoeyo9,1579299273.0,What kind of controlling “what you can and can’t eat” bullshit is that?! I would be pissed. Let me guess not a lot of folks bringing in lunch from home huh?
college,feoe20m,t1_fenmd4d,1579298837.0,"I hate the name Aramark and I just graduated. It’s ridiculous how many rules they have that even the dept for student organizations constantly finds loopholes from their contract so that is student orgs don’t get fined. 
A big one was, we can sell anything that Aramark doesn’t make. So a lot of folks would make rice crispy treats and make them a different color or use a unique color of icing because Aramark doesn’t make it. The school would get creative in favor of us. But why even have the contract if that’s the case? 
Another was the difference between serving size. A slice of pizza was considered a meal and we couldn’t serve it. Not only is their catering company ‘Classic Fare’ expensive,  its also great for making cardboard pizza, god I can’t get the taste of it out of my head. I found that slicing dominos pizza into square cut falls into the loophole really quick when I do smash tournaments for my org."
AskReddit,felqu18,t1_felczim,1579228701.0,I was eating 2-3 entire pineapples on a weekly basis to stop myself from drinking juice. Pretty sure I’ve done the same damage to my teeth if I would have just had juice but I will never get tired of that prickly fruit. I just hate cutting the damn thing.
AskReddit,fejwxb7,t3_epfjje,1579187730.0,Dry socket after wisdom tooth surgery. Doc gave me zero meds for it and I cried myself to sleep that day. I wouldn’t wish that level of pain on my worst enemy.
Austin,feitm92,t3_epberb,1579146885.0,"The e scooter thing is in most cities and a few colleges too. There in Memphis,Atlanta of course cities in CA and I think in College Station. They put them at my uni Sam Houston and went out one day hit the curb with it and flew off only to arrive on the sidewalk. You think 15mph is slow but no, I think I tore cartilage in my knee but it’s a great way to see the city. Houstonian here but there’s no way in hell they would ever allow them here."
