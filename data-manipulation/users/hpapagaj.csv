commandline,ff42x9e,t3_erirde,1579554379.0,I always wanted something like this.
selfhosted,ff0qs5z,t1_ff083we,1579471429.0,"That's quite an amazing price. What's the catch here? If I compare with a similar specification cloud server CX21 (dedicated cpu):

41.53 â‚¬/monthly  
4	vCPU  
16 GB	RAM  
160 GB	Disk space  
20 TB	Traffic

...the dedicated server seem to be a much better option. What are the negatives?

I have one more question about VPSes: how much benefit is from 1vcpu vs more vcpu on a classic LAMP server?"

3Dprinting,fd4pgk0,t1_fd4ors9,1578169762.0,"I thought the title would tell you. It's a best of the week project / Thingiverse.

I liked so much the original BOW project: I picked some of the best 3D things from the past week, which I printed later on the next week. I am printing less and less since this project ended. Here comes this project. It's not a hand picked list, but a sortable - searchable list of uploaded projects from the last week."
