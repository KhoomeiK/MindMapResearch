I don’t know you at all, but I’m glad you made it out of there (whatever “there” might be understood as; maybe you haven’t made it fully out, who knows), and all the way here. Good job. You’ve done well."
offmychest,fdqaqef,t1_fdpyyde,1578661394.0,"I have nothing to add because you hit every point I wanted to mention and then some, with an eloquence _and_ clarity I couldn’t very well rival. Especially your point about “you think you have it hard, but adults have it worse” (or as I was often told, “this is the best time of your life!”) being a horrible, ignorant thing to say to someone so young and suffering, that hit really hard. As I’m graduating college soon, I still hear this from people (as I have my whole life), and I still think the same, to some degree (I have my days): “If this is the best time of my life (or if that time has already passed), shouldn’t I just end it now? Isn’t that what you’re telling me I should do?”

I don’t feel this so much anymore, but before, eh, maybe even this semester, and okay, maybe still sometimes now, the whole “if I’m not doing great in everything, then I’m a failure and I will be homeless” was always on my mind as a kid. In high school, I would hit myself because I was disappointed that I didn’t talk to my advisor in middle school to put me two grades up in math classes so I could 1) be with a couple of my friends who skipped, and 2) get into community college math courses during high school. I would cry for wasting my lunch period eating, when I could have taken lunch P.E. so that I could fill my regular P.E. slot with another AP, and I hated myself for taking less than, I’m not even sure now, but something like less than 10 APs during high school. (Looking back, I want to say it was so ridiculous, but when school is your entire life, the only thing that gives your measly, undistinguished life meaning, and you feel like you’ve failed at it (or done less than the most you could do, which to some, is effectively the same as being a failure), it’s really not so ridiculous.)

I recall being in early grade school, no older than six or seven, when I would spend some recesses sometimes on the other side of the large tree between the classrooms and the fence/road, praying (non-religiously, though I did often think that if there was a kind god, that it would grant my wish) for a car to spin off the road and crash into me. After that tree became off limits (different ages had different play areas; older kid play areas were further away from the street and the fence) I would fantasize about overdosing on my father’s medicines (of course not knowing anything about what it’d be like, failure rates or anything), or committing seppuku (as if I had/could produce honor by doing so). The urge never really went away, but it manifested in different forms throughout the years. I spoke once in high school to my mom about wanting to commit suicide; I expected her to say, “I know” or something to that effect, but it was as though the thought had never even crossed her mind. It was so shocking to me, that something that haunted me, maybe not my every waking hour, but on a fairly regular basis, so heavily, could be so utterly unrecognized as even distantly relevant until mentioned explicitly by me. (She’d never, ever pressured me to do anything she thought I might find unpleasant (taking whatever higher classes, or extracurriculars) (to the extent that I’m pretty sure if I told her I wanted to drop out (pre-suicidal confession), she would let me do so without a question) (all of my Asian friends with tiger moms are envious of me, and I know it was an immense privilege for her to be this way, but I also wish she would have more or less forced me to do some things, because I still feel like I’m lacking things my friends with stricter parents now have (skills with sports and instruments for the most part)), but after I told her, she backed off even more, if that’s possible.) (I lost track of parentheses at some point but it’s 5am and I’m not going to proofread. Woo!)

I don’t know what came over me to make me want to spill so much of my childhood/academic trauma here; this was really meant to be a one or two line “thank you for writing this wonderful, in many ways quite perfect (and I don’t use that word a lot/lightly) assessment”, but.. this happened. Anyway, thank you. You’ve said good things, and I hope your message spreads, so that there may be more (much needed) empathy and compassion in the world."

college,fd6qle7,t1_fd6lrep,1578194516.0,I’m curious as to why you say this?
college,fd6qinf,t1_fd6ivoj,1578194491.0,"First off, thank you for the thoughtful response!

I’ve been putting it off, seeing one of the school counselors (though it doesn’t help that they make it pretty difficult to schedule an appointment, especially one that you don’t have to skip class to attend...), but you’re right. Things just seem sort of... objectively bleak for both my personal situation and the world at large, regardless of my own personal (bad) way of perceiving them.

With regard to employment... I just, in my experience, no one really wants a philosophy major; if you aren’t doing something especially technical (I’m thinking any of the fields you mentioned, but more typical trades as well), then they sort of expect business/economics/related studies.

I have been thinking about doing volunteer work, in fact! It just feels really... awful, I don’t know; it’s probably a lot my school culture (it’s not very prestigious, obviously doesn’t make six figures (not like I’m personally aiming for that anyway, whatever). I know it shouldn’t matter to anyone but myself what I do, and that I am in such an economic position where volunteering is certainly feasible... ah, I just have that mental block about it that I need to get rid of, because I do think that is, for my current self, the best option, I think. I’ll definitely look into it more seriously."
college,fd6li9b,t3_ejujtq,1578192760.0,"Virtually everyone from my school comes from out of the city; I think a large minority are from out of the country, even. After four years and plenty of conversations here, it really comes down to “it depends”, which is not a useful answer, as accurate as it is. Some people have no issue with coming back to school (or at least, leaving home) on a 17-hour plane ride where they only see family twice a year; others who live only three or so hours away by train cry every time they have to leave.

For me, I never had a problem till this year; I’d pack at home, they’d drop me off, and I’d unpack without thinking much about it. (This next bit will maybe be counterproductive for you, now that I think about it. Oops.) But now that I’ve really contemplated about things, how my parents are getting older and aren’t really in great health, how many times I’ll be able to see them again in our lifetimes, how my life has just become school and work and sometimes social life, how little I talk to my parents on the phone even because our schedules are so different and people are busy... I cry fountains just about every time they leave now. So in my case, it got harder, oops.

I think it gets easier with better relationships and time at school, but it’s never, for someone like you (based on what little I can infer about you from your post), going to be “easy”."
college,fd6kei2,t1_fd1yzxm,1578192347.0,"Totally second this. I never thought I’d be this kind of person, loving the feeling of paper and pens and the occasional taped-in notes and just everything about that scene, but ever since I was given an old iPad with Notability, my note taking experience has totally changed. I’m not trying to advertise for them or anything, but it has a lot of really useful features (like audio recording and scrubbing to see what you wrote when something was being said) and I don’t have to carry as much in my backpack every day (used to carry at least two notebooks, a small pen case, all the food things, a laptop, the large laptop charger, etc.; now it’s just food stuffs, an iPad, and a couple pens)."
college,fd6jj1r,t3_ek1amd,1578192002.0,"For my freshman year, I lived with two friends I’d had since late high school (they’d been friends since elementary, as far as I’m aware). I’m still friends with both of them (am living with one of them again (currently a senior), along with two others), but they had a huge falling out due to social differences and expectations of each other.

For my middle two years, I lived with two strangers (they were best friends and were just looking for a third) but felt really suffocated most of the time. They were generally nice, very considerate, but were also just of a different nature than me, and rubbed me the wrong way frequently. I don’t hate them, but it definitely made those years much worse than they had to be. (They met and became best friends their freshman year, living together throughout all of college.)

I’m now living with Roommate A from freshman year (whom I never see, just because of our schedules), a friend of hers (also rarely see her; she’s very nice, but a bit overbearing for someone who’s essentially a stranger to me), and a good friend from freshman year (was a floormate who I really clicked with). That last flat mate is also my roommate (housing is expensive here), and I love her a lot; she’s made my semester so much better (though of course, also has her own small annoying habits). Definitely my best living situation.

Honestly though, it really, really depends. People are full of surprises—a friend of mine is pretty cool with her flat mates, but they sometimes leave their cat in their room over long periods of time (I’m thinking extended weekends) with no one home, which puts a strain on her relationship with them. I know several people on both sides of the “my roommate always had their partner over” story, but who got along well otherwise. It’s a matter of how tolerant and considerate all of you are with one another. It really should be easy, but, eh, people have personalities."
college,fd66cxo,t3_e79s0s,1578186152.0,"I’m not sure about what can be done from the outside (of the student body) for free, but depending on your school (its size, policies, funding sources), you might be able to donate some money and designate a particular cause (such as developing a student mental health resource/clinic/sth) or sponsor an already existing club (my school has a lot of public service, mental health, and those sorts of student groups), and start something new that way. This is once you already have the money rolling in to do such a thing, though.

Does your school have any sort of mental health/wellness center? You could probably ask them as well?"
berkeley,fd61uwc,t3_ek1c2x,1578184382.0,"Hm, it depends on how bad, probably. I’m not sure about cheating on something like an exam, but on a smaller assignment or something, the professor will probably (in my experience; I haven’t been in such a meeting but from talking to professors I know and students who have been caught) just give you a stern talking to, a slap on the wrist essentially, and it’ll be like a “first strike” (out of two, let’s say). It’ll go on your record, but you probably won’t get expelled.

That said, not totally sure if it’s worth it to be honest with them at this point. If it’s bad enough (like copied a large amount verbatim) it might be worse to lie, but I’m not really sure."

Haven't really read through all the responses, but yeah, ik it might be awkward (certainly, no more awkward than.. what has already occurred), but making sure (asking) he's educated on sexual health/wellness (maybe do a bit of research yourself if you haven't already? since gay relationships are a bit different), and just general good relationship support.

berkeley,fc4wsxs,t3_eg5zg4,1577431719.0,"edit: oof sorry this got long; tl;dr since students are often staff and have finals too, it can take a bit longer, especially when things go wrong. Ideally, it's in your favor, though. 

Not sure what OP's individual circumstances/classes are, but even with classes that do have a fair amount of staff, there's often a lot of discussion on how to make students grades better after a particularly hard-hitting question/rubric item/assignment. Get enough students with the same issue and you have to look into any precedents, discuss what the best course of action would be, in many cases email the students (mostly for submission-related issues rather than actual question grading) and wait for a response..

Additionally, even if, let's say you have a staff of size = 20. Not all of those necessarily even grade every assignment. and it's probably split 50-50, 25-75, whatever. Regardless, they can't/won't publish grades until the vast majority of grading is finished; that is, hm, let's say your final is on Monday and let's also say you have 5/20 people on staff grading. 4/5 have finish their finals, eh, let's be generous, and say they finish on Tuesday. They start grading immediately and finish by Friday of finals week. Cool, but the 5th grader has a Friday 7-10p final, so they won't even start till noon the next day, maybe? Maybe they don't start until Saturday night, It might take them a couple days _tops_ to finish grading the majority of their assignment, and that brings us to Monday, mayyybe Tuesday? Now if something goes wrong, or they need to contact students, it may take another day or two. (The same/a similar issues arise in single-GSI classes.) In the meanwhile, if you had a final exam _and_ a final paper/project, this is happening x2 (in parallel, at least, but the fact that it's happening anyway gives you more room for error).

I'm not saying this is how it goes for all classes, but mm, this is how it's gone for mine a few times in the past >  <"""
