Their going home had nothing to do with the message.  In the prior episode, Philip (in disguise) met with Father Andrei.  The FBI had been watching the meeting, realized that Father Andrei was talking to an illegal, and chased after Philip as soon as the meeting ended.  He managed to get away, but Father Andrei got picked up, and since he'd seen them without their disguises on, Philip knew he could snitch on them (which he did).  

The garage scene is when they find out Oleg's been arrested, which means that since he can't deliver the message, they have to do it.  But even if Oleg had been able to deliver the message, they still would have had to go home or else spend the rest of their lives in an American prison."
