aww,fgmnlm6,t1_fgmluqe,1580928260.0,"Nice to meet someone on reddit undogmatic about cat care!

Edit: and I hear you on the secondary luxury thing. When we were doing flea pills it was $60? $90? Per month because we have two cats."
aww,fgmjss3,t1_fgmiril,1580926007.0,"I think people are overly worried about these things in America. Indoor-outdoor and flea-comb-only flea control is normal in most of the non-apartment-dwelling world and was normal here til the 1990s. 

I know I'm not getting bitten because I'm incredibly reactive when I do get bitten. 

My cats always live til their late teens at least. I'm almost 50 and so far haven't lost a cat due to anything but cancer, but if something does happen to one of them... well they'll have had a good life til then. Sometimes I think Reddit skews a little heavily towards the urban dweller, where indoor only is completely reasonable, but there are a lot of lifestyles out here.

EDIT and I'm pretty sure not having carpets and having mostly leather and wood furniture helps keep the fleas down. I've only ever had a flea infestation when I've had carpets.

The world is full of fleas because we have raccoons, opossums, and all sorts of things. I certainly am not going to carpet bomb my yard and garden free of all insects."

aww,fglc4mo,t1_fgl7tmt,1580890278.0,We will never get rid of them anyway since the cat will simply go out and sleep in some stinky raccoon nest or who knows what anyway. They don't bite us and they don't seem to bother the other cat- it has super short fur and I only rarely find a flea on it- so I don't care very much.
