That decreases the value of the currency and makes it easier to pay off remaining debt, while a decreased value also leads to more foreign investments and trade which provide even more cash. This slow devaluation process is a major contributor to inflation alongside bankruptcys of companys, which is practically the same on a smaller scale. A bank removes debt that can't be paid off by printing money.

No matter how much insulation you put on it, the iron will never get hotter than the flame. If it would get hotter, the iron would heat up the flame not the other way around.

They took multiple images from many locations as earth spinned and combined it into one as if the whole globe was one big antenna. Radiowaves are perfect for that.

space,fdcg9yu,t1_fd9h8px,1578274166.0,"We have not found habitable exoplanets. You confuse something. We found exoplanets that live in the habitable zone of their star like earth, but also Venus and Mars. There is no scientific evidence for anything beyond that. Hell, we don't even know whether Mars really was habitable for sure. If it was habitable for a billion years for example life should've evolved like on earth if life evolves out of dust everywhere where the conditions are right.

The only way to be 100% sure a planet harbors life is to look for signs intelligent species would leave. Like nuclear bomb tests and stuff like that. Or nuclear wars. That stuff must be going on somewhere.

If we find none of that in our Galaxy the chances for our own survival are slim. That means every species  develops a technology that kills all life sooner or later. Could be some AI-virus mix. ""We developed a micro-oganism that can kill cancer"" might be our last words."

RoastMe,fczq21m,t1_fcxq36c,1578106605.0,"Some people make bad relationship experiences at young age before they get to have sex. Or get traumatized by others having them when they were kids. They decide to take a break from relationships and actually become happy being alone and from then on are afraid to lose their happiness so they just avoid women like they are lava. It's like when you quit smoking. It's the devil. 

However, there is also the type that just doesn't want the good times to be over and take responsibility for kids and such, which often follows marriage. Life is just so much easier living with your parents. Why bother with all the complexity.. is there a law for that? Life ends so quickly and it often seems we do our best to enjoy it as little as possible because we feel guilty for doing so."
news,fczoph7,t1_fcz4u7e,1578105836.0,You forget about one thing: most computers run US software so it would be super easy to push updates before a war to render all computers useless. Brick them essentially. The world has no chance against the US especially because of the dominance in space and on a nuclear level. But WW3 is not about hardware or manpower. WW3 is not about conquering territories. It's about securing US technological dominance.  There can't be a country with a higher degree of technological advancement and therefore dominance over the US. You can set the timer based on the total number of devices that run US software.

This is not good.
politics,fctwe6q,t1_fctw2qg,1577962953.0,"That's what I said. Trump told them golf is bad and now everyone just assumes he is right? Trump was trash talking back then as he is trash talking today. He doesn't even care about his own trash talk. 

Had Trump said ""Obama eats too many vegetables, I will have no time for slow food and only eat fast because I will work all day for you"" the press would probably in similar Fashion bash Trump for eating vegetables. The irony is Trump can use that against the press. ""Look how stupid they are""

politics,fctv4fv,t3_eipltg,1577961112.0,"Presidents are humans too and need 1-2 days off a week. That's what we call weekend. Playing golf is a sport and at his age he better be active. He probably can't do much else since the risk of injury in most sports is too high. I'm not sure what the fuss is all about. 

The media seems to just follow Trump's commands. He said golf is bad and his word is law, so now they make b.s. articles on how bad it is for the president to play golf once a week. Meanwhile everyone with more than 2 braincells figures it's actually good. Trump was wrong. Maybe he realized it himself and moved on.

That just proves to me that the media is out of real arguments against Trump."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fcjxzyx,t1_fcjxo2x,1577709961.0,"That really makes no sense. you can't be better today than you are today. You can only get better given some time passes, so your future self in 10 or 20 will have it better.

I know what you are trying to say but you just can't aim for something you can't quantize. You don't know what the future brings and what you'll need to be happy. Just more of something you have today  is not the answer because the thing you have could be obsolete by then.

I doubt anyone would feel rich by having 20 old iPhone 3GS, yet you would still own 20 smartphones that costed a fortune only 10 years ago. Being rich and poor is not about what you own, it's about what you own compared to others. That won't change because everyone gets richer.

You could say being rich is like to have early access to everything. If everyone would have early access, it wouldn't be special anymore and it therefore wouldn't feel any special. If you make everyone rich, nobody will feel that way and you in fact made everyone poor."

The most common therapy for joint pain is swimming. However, you have to do the right training not just any. If you have pain while running you have to start with something less intense. Lay on your back and cycle in the air. There are plenty of exercises to work on your joints. The worst thing you can do for the joint is not to move it. It will only get worse."
CasualConversation,fc9u8e6,t1_fc9mc15,1577558296.0,"It probably comes from not running in first place. Moving your joints is the only way to repair them because they have no blood vessels. They require the fluids to build up doing sports to get the ""nutrients"" they need. A big misconception is to rest your joints to fix them. That's not how it works. Moving parts have no blood vessels because the grind would tear them apart. Think of it like oiling a mechanical joint. You have to move it back and forth for the oil to creep in."
