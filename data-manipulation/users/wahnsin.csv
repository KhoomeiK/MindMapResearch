That's why /u/TylerDurden1289 was right to be skeptical at first, I think.

I've done the googling you suggested, and yeah, face looks similar enough. That alone would not convince me, but I also saw a second nsfw video of hers where we see a (pixelated) shoulder tattoo, quite similar to the roses this Arlene lady has.

CastleRockTV,fdat2rn,t1_fcvf5kt,1578249757.0,"This. And even though that is not exactly convincing either and wouldn't work in real life, at least it's not the plot hole people are imagining.

And it's really the show's own fault - the flashback was just not very effective at showing what they wanted us to see. It shows what appears to be the grave Annie dug for Ace, and Annie next to it, shoveling. Of course we have to assume incorrectly that this is her memory of digging the grave.
I even remember wondering: she's just been through so much - killing the dude, dragging him there, falling down into some ancient crypt, seeing the body mangled some more, bugs and creepy iconography, not to mention a traumatic encounter with some rawdogging squatters in a creepy old mansion... and her flashback is of some dug up sand at a construction site?!

But yeah. Later in the episode we see that nobody at the site has raised the alarm - they've in fact poured the concrete. So, the hole must have been covered in some way. Checking the flashback scene a second time, I realized there's wood visible under the sand, slowly being covered as Annie shovels. So after emerging from the crypt/mansion she went back to the site and covered it up as best she could. Still somewhat unrealistic, but not a plot hole."
