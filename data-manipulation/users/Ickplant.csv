Many of us worked tirelessly for him for years and were tossed to the curb like a piece of litter without a second thought. Maybe it was calculated to keep the rest of the workforce on their toes and scared; maybe he was just able to detach from human connection to a remarkable degree. What was clear is that people who worked for him were like ammunition: used for a specific purpose until exhausted and discarded.

It cannot place too much of a burden on the employer, but your request is perfectly reasonable for a large company to accommodate.

They will request paperwork from your doctor/therapist, and you will have to ask for specific things, for example, “work from home on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9am to 5pm; work in the office all other days 9am to 5pm”. The employer will either go with whatever you request or ask for adjustments (I had to be voluntarily demoted because I could not work from home in a managerial position). You come to a compromise. 

Piece of advice - document everything. The process of requesting it and any interactions, performance reviews, write-ups, etc. that happen afterwards.

Denver,feie6pt,t1_fehg1nc,1579136426.0,"Yeah, I had to, despite the factual inaccuracy. Too perfect of a setup to pass up.


Fun random fact, did you know that CO has not 4, but 697 sides on the map? Crazy beans."

Trump has served his purpose, why do you think all of this is coming out, and Lev hasn’t been polonium’d? Putin wants 4-8 more years of gridlock and division. He knows Trump is done for, so he is adjusting his approach."
CPTSD,fei6srb,t1_fei5soy,1579131556.0,"You amount to a lot in my eyes. I barely made it through a 5K without any kind of injuries, and running 2 half-marathons is just *one* accomplishment of yours. Recovering from TBI is brutal, hard work. And you are actually addressing and successfully reducing substance use that very understandably resulted from what you’ve been through? Hell, yeah, that’s badass as fuck (pardon my French). You are your own sculptor, painstakingly persisting in your work despite people trying to tie your hands behind your back. 


I’m so sorry that they can’t see how far you’ve come. They are wrong, and you have every right to be upset or angry or anything you want to be, regardless of whether you have TBI or not. You are a human being with feelings and emotions - imagine that!"

Just an unfortunate string of events, made even worse by the persistent nasty smell in the car, which could not possibly be caused by bits of raw fish hidden in the outside air vents. That would be crazy!"

Lev Parnass produces really damning documents, Trump fucks up on Iran (no doubt he talked to Putin about it), this tape leaks, CNN starts attacking Bernie way worse than usual... 

Putin is setting your all up for 4-8 more years of gridlock and division. He knows Bernie will make the county better, and he is betting on a Dem President and House with a Republican Senate. He also wants to humiliate and weaken Americans on the world stage.

Showing that Americans elected a criminal President who ended up causing a ME crisis is a great way to do that."
politics,feh4lhi,t1_fegrqod,1579109026.0,"That this is all intentional. Trump and the RNC outlived their usefulness. Don’t you find it weird that you have Lev come out of the woodwork with such damning documents, this tape coming out, then CNN viciously attacking Sanders, all at the same time?


This is coming from a Russian who is not surprised at all about these developments. Russians (especially former KGB Colonels) are calculating as fuck. That’s the one thing that really separates them from Americans, who have been lulled into a sense of false security when it comes to preserving democracy.

Almost everything Putin does is intentional. He miscalculates sometimes, sure, but there is always a plan in place. Always."

He should be happy that someone who is not a gold digger and 20 years younger than him is even giving him a second look, tbh - all because of his rotten attitude. Nothing wrong marrying with an age difference if you are not a raging asshole."
