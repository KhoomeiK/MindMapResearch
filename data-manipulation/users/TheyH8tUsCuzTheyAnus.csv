I like the idea of stealing some high-production cities - maybe I'll work on doing a Crossbow push in the next 20 turns and then a Cossak push a little later.  In the meantime, I guess religious or culture victory makes the most sense for a long-term strategy?"

This game is with Peter, but I often see similar issues when I play as Korea.  (Korea tends to have more grassland hills at least, but usually lacks plains hills.)
