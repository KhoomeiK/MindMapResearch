To many people think just because they're suffering that they deserve and will get some sorry of credit or reward. It's the most ridiculous coping mechanism"

PlasticSurgery,ff9fjgc,t3_ese8lm,1579711930.0,"what a cute natural pout you have! A little filler in the top lip would definitely help balance anything you may not be feeling 100% about. Best of all it's temporary so if you don't like it, just give it a few months. I've had a lot of success with having the filler focus on the side of my lips, rather than the whole thing. A good experienced professional will be able to give you recommendations on shape and the type of filler. just make sure to do your research and try to get first hand referrals from a friend!"
