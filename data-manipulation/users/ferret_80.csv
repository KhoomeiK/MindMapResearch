at will employment is a thing and it can suck, but there are some protected classes where you can't be fired for, for example, gender or race. It sucks and can be stupid, but at the same time it's not the companies job to make sure someone's family is taken care of. two people could have the same salaries and similar costs, but one spends all their excess income on luxuries and the other saves up. being unemployed to those two people are very different situations, it's not the companies job to make sure their employee's have good spending habits. There is also unemployment payments that you can get from the government if you show that you are actively looking for a job, it's not a ton but it helps.

I mean, doesn't everyone do this. there's a reason a lot of manufacturing jobs have left the US, countries with less strict labour laws can push their workers harder for less money and gives the company bigger margins, every company tires to get more out of their worker for less.

Back bacon always felt like it could have been so much more. its more 'smoky ham' flavoured than 'smoky meat' flavoured so a lot of the time I feel it could just be swapped out for a ham or a smoked porkchop.

NOW we have thousands of organisms that can break down lignin and release the carbon back into the atmosphere. its possible all the organisims that can break down lignin die off because of the climate change and so woody plants can permanently remove CO2 from the atmosphere, but A) humans will likely have died off, or abandoned the surface of the planet by that point. and B) the process of carbon sequestration took a whole **150 MILLION YEARS**. Modern Homo Sapiens Sapiens isn't even 250 thousand years old.

Even if natural carbon sequestration started NOW, as in we somehow kill all organisms that can break down lignin without somehow that effecting the rest of nature, and without the sudden massive amount of dead but not decaying wood piling up and disrupting humans it will take longer than modern humans have been around to bring CO2 levels back into balance.

Edit: besides, just because it happened once before doesn't mean it will happen again, You can't even make a line with only a singular point of data let alone show a pattern. A bird called then shit on my head yesterday, does that mean i should expect a bird to shit on my head every time i hear one call and I'm outside?

Everything we know points to the evolution of the earth, up to and including humans, was a 1 in a million and in your opinion we should just go ""she'll be right"". Lets imagine, for arguments sake, that climate change isn't as dangerous as what all the scientists are saying. What is wrong with trying to clean up the environment and reducing carbon pollution. When you buy a house do you just live in it and expect it to maintain itself? you have to take care of it or it will fall down on you. the heating will break, garbage will pile up and eventually the house is unlivable.  
 
Or a dog, when you get a pet you dont just assume it will feed itself, exercise itself, and keep itself in all around good health? It can find and eat it's own food, it can run around on it's own and stay healthy, it can clean itself, but it's not always great at it and can screw it up. they'll eat something they shouldn't and you have to take care of them, they'll eat too much food if it's available and get fat, or they won't eat enough and starve, they'll run out into the street to chase cars, get bit by another animal, break a bone, or whatever. You don't just say, well that's dogs, she'll be right. you take the dog to a vet to treat injuries, you take your dog out for walks to keep them fit and prevent them from running out into traffic or fighting other dogs. You make sure you don't overfeed or underfeed. you brush their teeth or give them treats that help clean their teeth so they stay healthy for longer, you invest in a brush and shampoo to help keep them clean and healthy. Why can't we do the same for the earth, sure she may limp along for millions of years as is, humans alongside, or we could take care of her, treat that lung infection by removing all that excess carbon in the air, fix the Air-con so we don't overheat etc. Yes it will cost money, but so does a house or a pet, and god damn if our only habitable planet is maybe, slightly more important than a house or a pet."

bestoflegaladvice,fffumvt,t1_ffeni5i,1579892157.0,"At the same time I sometimes feel that 18 is the too early to decide on your career path, so many of my classmates changed majors within the first 2 years of college. and A-levels make you decide what you want to focus your education on at 16.

I know it's not locking you into that career and a lot of areas of study can help in multiple careers but still you're deciding on the course of your next 4 years of education at 16. 

I'd prefer a mix with a greater focus on vocational schools and apprenticeships as an alternative to college, but maintain the broader education through High School."

At 80 you usually already have full graceful so seers with Kandarin Hard teleport gives better xp rates than Rellekka."
