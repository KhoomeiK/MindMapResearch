While I was mulling over going back, realizing it was going to take 6 YEARS, I was bitching about it to my doctor while at an appointment.

Seriously Warren was my first real politician I followed who gave me faith. If she ran in 2016 she'd be my number 1 choice this time. But a long serving independent I never heard of stepped up and blew me away with his record. 

I dunno. It seems this was a huge set up and I don't want a politician who rigs the game. trump is awful, but so was being lied to and picking the least evil for every election. Now I will always think of this when I hear her talk about the rigged economy. I still like her second most, but this backfired."

I saw at least 3 questions like that.  When Biden was way out in front did they target him like this? Why do we ask endless  economic questions about Medicare but nothing on war costs? How come cnn can't ask trump a follow up to a blaten lie but after Bernie denied saying it the moderator pressed forward affirming that he did say what he just denied saying?

The cnn talking heads are millionaire mouthpieces to their billionaire owners. The same ""news"" org that worked with donna b to get Clinton early access to debate questions against Bernie, then hired her after.

AskEngineers,fdqp59c,t3_empwmr,1578671856.0,"Water is an amazing chemical. The enthalpy of vaporization of water is the energy required to change liquid H2O to a vapor. Heat capacity is the energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram 1 degree (Celsius or Kelvin).

Water has high numbers for both. With sand you would need to cover the area deep enough to keep oxygen from getting to it, but sand isn't doing much with that energy. The fire can restart when O2 gets back to it. Water has 4 times the heat capacity of sand. Also the sand won't get hot enough to change phases so you don't get that bonus either. Then you take the effort to pump water vs the effort to pump sand in to account and you see why we don't have sand trucks putting out fires. Also, if your fire is on a building or farm or forest you don't turn it into the Sahara desert after putting out the fire.

Bonus: ice keeps your cooler cold the same way, by melting, not because it is initially cold. 

Water takes 4200 J/kg to heat up 1 degree C. It takes 330,000J/kg to melt ice (changing 0C ice to 0C water). It takes 1,200,000J/kg to vaporize water to steam."
