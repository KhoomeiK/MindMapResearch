changemyview,ffkbisv,t1_ffjz7ta,1580020071.0,">Would I have been harmed had I been allowed to transition as a child?

This isn't about you, it's about children in general. 

As a rough analogy, think of it like getting a tattoo. Any tattoos you have right now would have probably been fine when you were 14 years old, because you have the benefit of perfect hindsight. But as a general rule, should we be letting 14-year-olds get tattoos? Probably not. 

I'm not saying we can't recognize kids as transgender or provide them with counseling, only that until they turn 18, any sort of transition should not be encouraged. I'm sure you're somewhat aware of the desistance rate in transgender youth.

As for denying medical treatments or disallowing them to change their legal documents, is this really a thing? I'm not denying it but I've never heard of it.

And as for prison, there's no easy answer. It's easy to say that transgender female prisoners should be going to female prison and sound progressive, but inside the prison system, how happy are female prisoners going to be when a dick is in the shower stalls, or (worst case scenario) a former rapist is among their numbers? 

And as for bathrooms, I don't mind the genitals or identity of the person in the stall next to me. But I don't see this as a way of making it functionally illegal to be transgender. 

I hope this wasn't too emotionally exhausting for you, I know these matters are rooted close to your identity. But this wouldn't be a proper CMV without dissent. For what it's worth, I have no clue why this CMV is getting downvoted."

Also fun for me, I had a ""pet"" squirrel up in McEachern. There's a tree that is close to the back of the building, and when I put nuts on my ledge, a local squirrel would hop from the tree, latch onto my window screen, and eat up. Don't believe me?

Most people in society, conservative or not, feel the same way about these issues. 

Biological men developed with testosterone shouldn't be shattering women's world records as amateur athletes, nor cracking skulls in MMA matches. Children shouldn't be transitioning genders when their brains are over decade away from being fully developed. For most people, these platforms are not difficult to understand. 

So I would argue the attention given to these areas (and the others you've mentioned) stem from society's reaction to outlandish news stories and not a conservative attempt at creating division."

college,ffgzw34,t1_ffg6jq4,1579919373.0,"At my college, I think when you fail a class and retake it, your second grade is the one that sticks, not the average of the two. Is this not your policy?

Either way, unless you're taking mickey mouse classes you won't get straight A's this semester. You'll be on probation. So you likely need to average 3.0's or higher just to not get kicked out of college and consistent 3.7+s if you want a hope at going to engineering school or having a GPA you can put on a resume someday. To put it into perspective, if you took school for 8 more semesters (4 years) and got a 3.7 GPA each time, you'd graduate with a 3.29. So you've kinda fucked yourself. 

Now here's the good news: A lot of colleges have something called academic renewal. It is what you think it is -- forgiveness for grades for certain semesters. But this is offered only under qualifying circumstances and is at the discretion of the college. If you want to improve the chances they'll consider you, you're going to need to get off probation ASAP and get those grades sky high, be on the Dean's List or better every single semester. That's your best bet, and it's still not guaranteed.

Not impossible to get out of this mess, but I'll guarantee right now that it will take a 100% shift in your routine. If you don't quickly become the most studious person you know, then you're screwed."

Seems like a generation of gamers were spoiled by the Fortnite content cycle, which Epic achieved by ensuring their devs work 90 hour weeks and are always on call. 

As for QA, what people don't get is that for every test like ""Is this camo showing up properly on this weapon?"", there are 50 other behind-the-scenes tests. Unit tests make sure methods are handling data correctly, integration tests make sure different components of the system are communicating properly, regression tests make sure that newly added content doesn't mess up old content, I can go on. It's a long process and they aren't given a long time to work on it.

Some things will get past QA. That's the reality of having a complex codebase and tight deadlines. If you want to know what it's like internally, look at the fact there was a bug in an older patch that crashed your game when you launched an RPG in the prone position while having certain attachments on your main gun.

Especially today, the poorest in the US are faring better than the majority of the people on this planet, and even better than a great number of people in first-world countries. Looking at some simple stats:

* 56% of the US is ""high income"" (compared to 7% of the world)

* 32% of the US is ""upper-middle income"" (compared to 9% of the world)

* 7% of the US is ""middle income"" (compared to 13% of the world)

* 3% of the US is ""low income"" (compared to 56% of the world)

* 2% of the US is ""poor"" (compared to 15% of the world)

Give me a break. You're basing this off of like 2 bugs which went live? Do you have any idea how many test cases programmer write? Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, regression testing, load testing... in most Agile environments this is all handled and managed by team leads and not project managers. 

We're seeing ""poor QA"" in games these days because gamers have extremely unrealistic standards for acceptable timelines. They were spoiled by Fortnite (Epic is another hellish company to work for, just read reviews on Glassdoor).

nfl,ff4l92q,t1_ff4blgx,1579566336.0,"Not feasible. 

Let's first just focus on numbers. We have 120.5 guns per 100 people in this country. That number is fucking extreme beyond comprehension. That's more guns than people. That's twice any other nation on the planet. The next first-world nation on the list is Canada with 34.7 guns per capita. Most European countries hover around 10-20 guns per 100 people.

In absolute terms, the US has almost 400,000,000 privately owned firearms. Let's put that number into perspective. The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Elvis Presley all together have sold a little under 400,000,000 albums over the years. If these were all 0.5mm thick records, then we're talking a single stack of records 200 kilometers tall. So if you will, imagine the logistical nightmare of trying to confiscate every single physical record sold from these artists.

Now drop the record analogy and remember we're actually dealing with a tool meant to kill other human beings, a tool which is a Constitutional right to possess in the US, a tool which is viewed as the last true power of the people. The absurdity of gun-grabbing in that context is mind boggling.

So then ignoring all logistics, which is a tough task, one could ask the question ""If we tried it anyway, would it work?"" Well you can't take policies and expect them to have the same result everywhere. If that weren't the case, then there would be low gun crime in Mexico or Brazil, two countries where guns are as heavily restricted as they are in Europe. Gun control didn't work in these countries because guns were everywhere. Black markets formed and criminal enterprises had no difficulty finding weapons. So it's tough to imagine America wouldn't suffer the same fate."

That's not true, and this is one of the most oft-repeated bad statistics in criminal justice discussions.

Go back to the [original source](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED338997.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3tgG-uXzA7ua5Or3rZr9VzzwaBYgvTPZx1jGA4OMQtJ6za6mWf67fukqY) of the ""40%"" statistic and you'll find that ""domestic violence"" isn't what they were measuring. They measured whether cops ""behaved violently."" What counts as behaving violently? According to the study: Slamming doors, spanking children, getting into verbal arguments, and so forth. Not to defend any of these acts, but I think it's clear to most of us that slamming a door or spanking a kid is hardly similar to physically assaulting your wife.

The actual reported rate for spouse abuse among LEO families was 10%. As the study points out, the national average at the time was 11%.

Notice how I'm speaking in the past tense. That's because the paper was published in 1991, and uses sources from the 80s and early 90s. It isn't acceptable to make inferences about police in 2020 from data which was last relevant 30 years ago, especially not if you're going to misread the data. Remember how two paragraphs ago I mentioned how spanking children was considered a violent act? In the 1980s-1990s, approximately 70% of families agreed that spanking children was sometimes necessary. 

Furthermore, as I pointed out, the paper was published in 1991. The Brady Law was passed in 1994. So the law that you're calling ineffective literally didn't exist in the timeframe of your data.

By the way, since I'm here, want to know what the paper's authors actually said about LEO familial violence? They attributed it to on-the-job stress factors, such as seeing morbid imagery and working hours which prevented them from spending time with family. Of course, this is also lost on the anti-cop crowd, who want to partially defund police departments, which is strictly the opposite of what the authors recommended."
