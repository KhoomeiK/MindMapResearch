singapore,fdvdxhm,t1_fdtl03t,1578746374.0,"Religion wasn't a dumb thing to have, say, 2000 years ago. I mean, the reason why you have food restrictions like kosher, halal, etc. food was because someone saw a trend that kept their followers healthy (and may or may not have attributed it to divine intervention) and wrote that into doctrine so future followers could be healthy too.

Now in the modern day, when science has shown that those practices indeed increase hygiene levels and there are better ways to do it, those religious laws, in my opinion, are now moot.

Everything has pros and cons and is a sliding scale.

Personally, idgaf what your religion is as long as you aren't a genuine asshole. Do good cuz you're a good person, and not cuz you're trying to go to heaven."
