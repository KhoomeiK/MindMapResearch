I know that tourists can be disrespectful at times, but that does not mean every tourist is disrespectful.
On the other hand, I think it’s incorrect to disrespect a shrine or other holy places, or public areas in general.
Not all Japanese people are respectful too, but at least they know how easy it is to call 110 and report someone for vandalism and stuff."
