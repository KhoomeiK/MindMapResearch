climateskeptics,ff0p97h,t1_ff0oxb8,1579470958.0,what does your comment have to do with mine
climateskeptics,fezk6v2,t1_fezk0u9,1579458210.0,but did you read the article
climateskeptics,fewcqyv,t3_eqp53u,1579408476.0,the article this is from is literally about the current warming being extremely rapid and an anomaly. posting just this graph is totally misleading and poor form
climateskeptics,fewb8v7,t1_fesz8kt,1579407868.0,where in the study is the graph?
nihilism,feuh14b,t1_fetsz15,1579386506.0,death is only tragic if you let it be
MapPorn,feohxd2,t3_eq52ce,1579300443.0,south carolina hates ohio???
nihilism,femnkoz,t1_fem8zsl,1579263798.0,"we’ve already established that all knowledge is limited and cannot be achieved with certainty. however, you asked how we know there’s nothing after death, and i responded that i rely on this as fact. functionally, i know it to be true just as much as i know the sun will appear tomorrow."
nihilism,femnbd2,t1_femhyx7,1579263526.0,exactly
nihilism,fem7pw1,t1_fem7f3h,1579242766.0,"i disagree that skepticism can negate science to nothing. it can be used to negate the extent to which we can rely on scientific findings as truth, but you can’t say it negates these findings to nothing. that’s like saying all evidence is useless just because it can’t be proven with absolute certainty"
nihilism,fem63ex,t1_fem5lav,1579241068.0,"of course you can’t know anything for certain, that’s obvious. what i’m saying is that is my belief because it is supported by evidence. that is, we attribute consciousness to the brain for numerous reasons, and there is yet to be any comparable explanation for consciousness, so therefore it is most reasonable to believe that the brain is the system that is responsible for consciousness. you can’t just say “oh but skepticism” and negate the validity of scientific evidence"
nihilism,fem53kx,t1_fem4yly,1579240062.0,"it is by far the most well supported conclusion, and I rely on it as fact to the same degree that I can rely on any other information as fact."
nihilism,fem4jlm,t1_fekxr1e,1579239519.0,"there’s not much reason to believe that there is, as the system that contains your experience of consciousness deteriorates"
BrownU,fdtluqk,t1_fdsrerk,1578718638.0,hope to see you next year then 🙏🙏 good luck
BrownU,fdsqgaj,t1_fdsnt63,1578706617.0,"for sure! are
you applying rd?"
BrownU,fdsmz62,t1_fdsmf6r,1578705334.0,"keep in mind that a higher score doesn’t mean your app is that much better. you’ve made it in the score department, but the rest of your app will make all the difference. hella people get in without subject tests though, they’re just a lil confirmation that you’ve been successful with difficult material"
BrownU,fdsfx48,t1_fdqw638,1578701875.0,i should add that it definitely will vary depending on what the rest of your application looks like
BrownU,fdqqogz,t3_emqdmk,1578672817.0,a friend got in with zero. it’s helpful but will not change your app. i’d guess it’s like an extra ten points on the sat (tiny boost but doesn’t make up for anything or really make a difference). apparently it can help when you don’t have ap scores to show
BrownU,fdcqlmh,t1_fdchik0,1578281586.0,i’m sure i’ll survive. thanks for the reply
BrownU,fdcqkrb,t1_fdcekmh,1578281567.0,"its all good, thanks for the reply"
BrownU,fdcd0pt,t1_fdccf6s,1578271926.0,"so it’s legit just the questionnaire? also, how do you know?"
LSD,fd6gskk,t3_ek4yke,1578190781.0,"Originally known as [Intersections](https://www.artprize.org/anila-quayyum-agha/2014/intersections), it was created for an art competition in Grand Rapids, MI called ArtPrize ([which it won](https://www.google.com/amp/s/observer.com/2014/10/anila-quayyum-agha-wins-both-the-public-and-the-jury-award-at-artprize/amp/))."
whowouldwin,fauuxcj,t1_fatjbn6,1576352989.0,"but under #11, person 9’s distance ability would be nullified by person 14’s ability, so they’d have no advantage. I think person 14 should have a much higher spot"
