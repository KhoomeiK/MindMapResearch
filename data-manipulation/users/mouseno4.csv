This attempt I went for pure distance, nothing more. First attempt was distance and maximum height (500m + 130m) and achieved 2555m before I pulled it back thinking I might not get it back. Turns out I got it back with ample time to spare. Hence the second attempt.

I \**might*\* be able to reach 5km... But that would be consuming my safety buffer and arrive back on the power still left in the battery wires! If - *IF* \- it gets back at all."

My government could track my phone right now, but I know that they would unlikely even want to. Because what do they have to gain?

And monitoring an entire population is beyond ridiculous in cost of money and manpower to accomplish. Even if done electronically and automatically. 

So they tracked your drone. So what? The only thing they have to gain is to ensure you are following the laws. And that is a worthwhile cause!"
drones,ffgwf4o,t1_ffgtwma,1579916782.0,Ah yes. Good point. A quad wouldn’t be able to carry sufficient solar panels to generate enough power to maintain itself. Even if you stripped it down to the frame it still couldn’t do it.

I once heard of a cow quite literally breaking it’s own neck trying to escape through a fence because it’s neck got stuck in the fence. 

Cows regularly injure themselves FAR more than farmers ever do. 

One thing everyone needs to realise is that even a single cow is VERY valuable to the farmer. 

A farmer would never harm a cow out of malice. Because it would be like taking cash out of your wallet and throwing it away. No farmer would ever do that. 

A cow breaks a leg, that is a loss for the farmer. They cannot produce milk, cannot breed, cannot produce quality meat and is only useful for slaughtering. 

Almost all farmers WANT their animals to flourish! It benefits the farmer just as much as the animal!  

Yes twisting the tail or kicking it may seem cruel but cows are stubborn AF. They don’t intend to be cruel or to try to permanently harm it!!"
