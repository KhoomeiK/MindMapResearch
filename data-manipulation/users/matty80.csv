When Alex finally gets his POV chapter, he muses in it that if Holden and Amos ever did come to blows that it would be a genuine unknown quantity. And that it could happen because in their own ways they're really dominant personalities.

He's also a trained fighter because he's ex-military.

The one thing I always say about wedding planning is, basically, as much as you can, try to stay pretty chilled about *most* stuff. Some people obsess so much over the minutae that it ends up driving them nuts and ruining the weeks and months before the day itself. It can cause arguments and general strife within the relationship, too. 

Thing is if one or two tiny things are a bit 'out' here or there... none of your guests are going to care or even notice. And you two will be so caught up in it all that you won't either; turns out wedding days go REALLY bloody fast. And don't let any other bugger tell you what you 'should' be prioritising, either. They aren't the ones getting married.

So my advice is to relax, enjoy the planning process without getting too caught up in the tiny details, and have a nice time together planning something that is, after all, for *you* and *her* above all else. 

Ours was a small wedding too. I think your plan sounds beautiful.

I vividly remember some of my time with her when we were young girls of no older than 7 or 8, I think. Problem is, I know she never existed because I realised later that she's a collage of memories from other places.

I remember the layout of her garden and the slightly weird outhouse/garage her parents used for storage. I remember that her bedroom was in the attic and that the stairs led in to an almost immediate wall so you had to go back around them to where her actual stuff, bed etc was. I remember us trying to have a 'midnight feast' but being unable to stay up that late so eventually just eating all the food and passing out. I remember that she had a PC of her own - unheard of for a child in the 1980s - and we played Elite on it.

Problem is, the house & garage belong to a different friend, which I realised when I moved from Scotland to England then went back to visit everyone with my parents. The bedroom exists but not with that layout, and it's another girl's bedroom. The person with the PC that we played Elite on was actually a boy (!) and we were more like 11 or 12. I don't know where the midnight feast came from, but I do like the idea of midnight feasts so possibly I just made that up completely. 

Anyway, this girl exists as a close childhood friend but only in my head. There is no Ashley. Her entire existence is a conjuring trick my brain won't let go of. I don't think about it until I see things like your post, but when I do think about it then it is quite a maudlin experience. I'll never be totally convinced that somewhere in that jumble is not some part of that person and my parents simply forgot about it in the haze of being a young-ish married couple with two children under the age of 10. The problem is that there's a potential darker repressed memory somewhere in there and that she lives in it somehow, but I don't think so because I don't associate any of it with any negative emotions other than the obvious confusion.
