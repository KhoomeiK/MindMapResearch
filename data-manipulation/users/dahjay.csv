bestof,ffdpivy,t1_ffdo8de,1579825891.0,"I think there are factors that play into all this and I'm just riffing here but...

1. Training - Police are training is very tactical with an 'us vs them' mentality.  Kill or be killed.  Not saying it's right or wrong because it's not an easy job at all.
2. Internal competition for promotions - Young, aggressive officers want to show their worth out of the Academy and start writing as many violations as they can and get their ass recognized when there's an opportunity for a promotion that becomes very competitive internally.
3. Money - As with anything, money changes everything.  A police officer works for 25 years and then collects a lifetime pension which is a percentage (I think between 60 - 80% but I could be wrong) of the pay for the last few years of their service.  This is why you see guys racking up the overtime to get paid and to get into the highest pay bracket for their eventual retirement.

Retiring at 50 with a full pension and benefits sounds pretty good to me.   I know a lot of officers who look at their 2nd life after retirement as the beginning."

He doesn't care to know the downstream (pardon the expression) implications of his actions that way he can't be held accountable when it all goes up.  It's his MO for sure.  If you feel so inclined, read The Fifth Risk by Michael Lewis (his books are great) and also look at this [article](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/donald-trump-roy-cohn-relationship) to get an insight into how ~~he~~ Trump operates his ""favor"" network.  All the little tactics like brutally attacking your opponent are tactics used to make his opponent look bad and make himself look good.  All the little nicknames he throws on people are designed to make them repeatable socially (Shifty Schiff, Do Nothing Democrats, etc.) and make people not pay attention to the truth.

He's a family business owner and he's going to do right by his family's business and his pocket first and foremost.  It's very capitalistic.  You have to think about the network of people that's been surrounding him for his entire life in real estate development.  The building contractors, the land contractors, the money that goes to the local municipalities, security contracts from local PD for traffic regulation, public safety, et. al.  All of it.  Think about how much is being sold from 3rd party companies trying to get a contract for their products.  It's big business.  Imagine all the regulations that are part of large real estate development and environmentalists are part of that equation.  From his perspective, these regulations are in the way of him and his network of business acquaintances doing everyday business stuff.  There were likely new Obama era environmental regulations that stopped him from doing some bullshit that he wanted to do so that adds to his fire of disdain towards Obama.  

This is why business tactics and government tactics don't work together.  Trump's impeachment is basically shady, backdoor business crap that goes on every day in the corporate world.  He said his call was ""perfect"" because it's just like any other favor deal that he's worked throughout his career.  It's such a crazy dynamic.
