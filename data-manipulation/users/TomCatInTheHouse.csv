AskMen,ffvqqcc,t3_evay0q,1580270619.0,The only person that ever did this was my ex-wife.  Guess what she did?  Cheat on me.
datingoverthirty,fftcexg,t3_eut684,1580216310.0,"If they say all, then yes I agree.  But if they've got one or two they say were crazy, but have nice things to say about the rest then they are likely fine.  

I'm in that situation myself.  My ex-wife is a bit crazy and we never should've gotten married.  Everyone else I've dated were fine ladies and I hope they find what they are looking for.  We just didn't work out due to our life situations."

But then, I've found most shows that get cancelled and then brought back fit this bill."

datingoverthirty,ffllobn,t1_ffljuoy,1580041165.0,"This is not what narcissism is...  at all.  

If she were narcissistic, she would be seeking attention of others, putting them on a pedestal and using them to assauge her fragile ego before tossing them somewhat aside while often cheating on them, then when they start to pull away, go back to putting them on a pedestal to keep them on the hook, and then tearing them down once they are back on the hook.

Narcissists typically do not stay single very long nor only go on few dates and then friendzone the person.  Maybe OP has high standards that eliminate a lot of potential candidates, sure, but that's not what narcissism is."

I tell people I'm happily divorced for 5 years.

She's had a parade of men since divorce while I'm on my third relationship and each one so far has gotten better than the last."

That being said, you are still some kind of low life to sleep with someone you know is married."
SingleParents,ff9m2o5,t1_ff9l922,1579715848.0,"I agree.  Both need to shift.  Dads aren't ""babysitting"" nor ""giving mom a break.""  Nor are we some sort of superhero."
SingleParents,ff9dl9a,t3_ese4my,1579710687.0,"Single dad here, joint custody situation.

What I experience is people who see me alone with my kids and they comment on me ""babysitting"" and ""giving mom a break.""   When I explain that we are divorced and I have the kids half the time, then it's usually ""we need more dads like you.""  In reality, especially with younger generations there are a lot of dads like me."
SingleParents,ff933jg,t3_esab8p,1579703660.0,He's trying to control you despite you two being divorced.  Ignore him when he does this.  Don't respond at all.
changemyview,ff92m9d,t3_es9ouk,1579703319.0,"Speaking from personal experience, yes I put the blame on my ex-wife than I did any guy she slept with; however, if the other party *knows* the person they are with is married, they share some of the obligation to know what they are doing is wrong.  They know this person is married and they are hurting someone they do or do not know.  They have some culpability.  A majority of the blame is on the cheating spouse though.

It would be like saying the guy who drives the getaway car in a robbery shouldn't be blamed because he didn't actually rob the bank.  He was just the driver of the vehicle to get to and from the bank."
