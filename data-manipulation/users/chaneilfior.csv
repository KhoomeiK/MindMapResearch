Advancement isn't a guarantee and there's a very strong chance that this period of comparative safety won't last."
Tulpas,ffg0e3v,t3_etehw0,1579895744.0,"Funny timing with this post, as I decided only a few hours ago that I'm going to do this. I sometimes get social anxiety-type reactions toward my proto-tulpa's human form. If I visualize him as an animal (but not making it his ""true"" form), it seems to help."
Tulpas,ff3s8kh,t1_ff3m2il,1579547732.0,"As a reader, thanks for answering the question. The ""well *technically*"" responses are useless in my eyes, as they skirt around what it's like to have a seemingly independent thought process from a seemingly separate and conscious individual. Anyone without a tulpa could spout off about intrusive thoughts. And intrusive thoughts *are* often unsettling, so gee, how helpful."

However, that doesn't seem to be the general consensus of this sub, what with the average ratings that were just posted? So whatever, who knows.

However, I didn't fully grasp that this word has connotations beyond just being a term for those who are unusually beautiful.

You can tell yourself before bed or throughout the day that you'll see her in your dreams. It works best for me if I imitate a calm sense of confidence about it, as in I have to make myself really *feel* it in my gut that I will see someone. As strongly as if I had an appointment to keep with them.

You can also write down a script for how you want the dream to play out, and read it before bed. Similarly, you can just imagine the dream you want to have, while paying close attention to emotions. Writing down reminder notes or having alerts may help too. 

The main thing is to remain relaxed and patient, and to engage your emotions and senses, I think. It can take a while to work, or it can work immediately."
LucidDreaming,fdo00w2,t3_em3ej6,1578596314.0,"I've read varying accounts. On the occasions I've tried it, it made it easier to fall asleep, but it didn't increase the vividness of my dreams or help with lucidity."

I tried everything to remedy its problem with browning tips/dying leaves. Distilled water only, tried to get the lighting just right, replanted it in a different pot and new soil just in case, on and on, blah blah. It just keeps dying.

Finally I decided it wasn't worth the effort and ignored it for months, almost never watered it (only when I felt a twinge of guilt). And yet this plant that should be a dead husk by now is sending out two new leaves. Why?! I don't dare get my hopes up."

My two issues with it are the Doctor betraying the Master to the Nazis, and the mind erasures. Regarding the Master, at least, I'm telling myself that the Doctor must've been very confident in the Master's ability to escape."
doctorwho,fdd1u4x,t3_ekijli,1578291438.0,"Just finished. I really enjoyed it. The Master was incredible.

Tulpas,fdac0aq,t3_ek3tct,1578244364.0,"This is related to what'd happen when I first tried to create a female tulpa. I'm cis female, and I initially didn't want an opposite-gender situation. Partly due to my lack of insight into being male, but at the time it also seemed like people made opposite-gender tulpas for romantic reasons, and that's not something I'm remotely interested in.

However, I had very few positive relationships with female relatives and friends while growing up. So when I tried crafting the tulpa's personality, it kept resulting in some perfect mother/aunt/sister/best friend figure that was clearly a substitute for whatever I felt I'd missed out on. It felt fake and unhealthy (and boring! like a constant pity party). I didn't want this whole experiment to be defined by people in my past who'd let me down. It also brought to light a lot of internalized sexism. So I ended up switching to a male form for the proto-tulpa."
doctorwho,fd4g3ad,t3_ejxhq6,1578167179.0,"The color palette is different, and there's still a billion of those bizarre close-up shots that force you to stare up the actors' nostrils and think too much about the realism of their facial expressions (or lack of). We're given a front row seat to watching their mouths physically speak the lines, while the background is diminished and blurred.

There's also the matter that it feels like you could switch a lot of the dialogue between characters, and it wouldn't make much of a difference. Or the tendency for the dialogue to narrate what's going on, instead of letting the actions speak for themselves. Like it's written to be a radio program instead of a TV show. That isn't *directly* about visuals, but connects with my own inability to get absorbed in the show and see the characters as distinct individuals, or as more than just actors delivering lines."

Yes! An absurd amount dialogue that could've been cut right out and the scenes would've been better for it."
gallifrey,fcu8ghw,t3_eixc7j,1577975027.0,"I sadly agree with your observations about the companions' unlikely/unrealistic behavior, and the Doctor's frustrating passiveness. The dialogue was a barrier as well. ""I think I see something moving out there!"" *Something moves*. Wow, I'm gripped by the suspense. 

I did enjoy O/The Master though. The predicament they were in at the end, with the companions left by themselves in a crashing plane and the Doctor whisked off to the mystery realm? Nice."

\- O/The Master -- favorite character throughout.

\- The flying house TARDIS, hahahaha.

Otherwise, I'm continuing to struggle with bonding to most of the characters. Spoiler tags for negativity: >!My attention wandered a lot because of it (hence the need for a rewatch). The Doctor still feels like a lesser version and this bothers me the most. She's more indecisive and unassertive, doesn't seem as clever as her past selves. And the companions -- I just don't like them much even after all this time. They seem bland and two-dimensional. I'm not sensing that energy from previous companion-Doctor relationships, where the companions are a mix of excitement, fear, and curiosity, and the Doctor is delighted to show them around time & space, but with a sad awareness of possibly losing them. !<

>!And it's stupid, but while watching, I started noticing how often everyone's mouths were just hanging open when not speaking. The Doctor's too. Allll the time. Hey everybody, just look lightly befuddled/concerned until it's time to scream or say something.!<"
doctorwho,fcsnom8,t1_fcsjwcc,1577920544.0,"I agree with you on that. If someone has a problem with 13's or the Master's portrayal or casting, there are far more constructive ways of discussing it."

And I'll say what I've already said before in this thread and elsewhere. I *don't* think art should be removed. But I also don't think it should be allowed as standalone posts. Because as it is, it encourages attention-seeking and shallow involvement. Above all, its overuse contributes to the perception of tulpas as being only childish make-believe.

That's why I settled on ""art's okay but only in the context of a larger post."" Instead of just no art. Since tulpamancy has creativity at its heart and it doesn't make sense to squash it entirely. (Not that anyone's taken advantage of it here yet, but still.)

Tulpas,fc7lny4,t3_egml5y,1577511478.0,"Just to be sure -- visualization, as in an imagined image of them? Or do you mean visual imposition, which is training the mind to hallucinate seeing a tulpa in the real world, as you would see a physical person?

Visualization within the mind can be very realistic with practice."

Tulpas,fc74ted,t1_fc72pfc,1577497548.0,"Yup, I've experienced much the same. If only that beginner's enthusiasm lasted forever! Given KenboCalrissian's more spontaneous forcing style, I wondered how that may have affected them.

I like the idea of four stages of learning for explaining the emotional struggles one goes through when pursuing a new passion. Stage 1, a person beginning something new is enthusiastic and highly committed. Stage 2, the person becomes disillusioned and feels like they have little to show for their efforts. Stage 3, the person realizes how much work needs to be done and they are full of self-doubt. Stage 4, they've become confident in their skill and commitment is high once more.

I think I'm bouncing between stage 2 and 3 right now."
todayilearned,fc7240p,t1_fc6zek7,1577495501.0,"Yes. However, in the United States at least, a claim that the majority of convicted are innocent appears to be quite false. One estimate for innocent prisoners in the United States is 6%, and innocent people confessing for the sake of plea bargains could be around 2-8% ([source](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kvj3d/why-are-there-up-to-120000-innocent-people-in-us-prisons)). The number of innocent prisoners on death row could be somewhere between 1.6-4.1% ([source](https://www.newsweek.com/one-25-executed-us-innocent-study-claims-248889)). Numbers which are unacceptably, horrendously high -- but still very far from being the majority.

Your wording implies that many more innocent people are executed than guilty ones. Did you mean to say that? Fair point otherwise."
Tulpas,fc629az,t1_fc5zsj9,1577470634.0,"Quite probably. Early successes would be exciting and could create an expectation of easy and natural development, and to then not have that expectation met could dampen hopes. (Even if, logically, you do know that it could take a lot of effort.)"

Tulpas,fc5xh7r,t1_fc4wc86,1577467943.0,"Very nice, thank you for sharing. You say you barely follow it these days, is that because it was too taxing? Or did you find this to be something you could do most days?"
Tulpas,fc5xcaj,t1_fc5sjkg,1577467867.0,Have you had the problem of slow development outliving the passion?
Tulpas,fc5vgvs,t3_eg7ojm,1577466769.0,"I'm surprised some people think it's clearly wrong to put a proto-tulpa into a situation of conflict, since as KenboCalrissian says, role-playing and stories are reportedly a way for accidental tulpas to form. And there are creation guides out there that suggest imagining your tulpa in a variety of situations, as a method for strengthening personality traits. If you make it clear that it *is* a story -- a hypothetical scenario you're creating instead of a memory -- then surely that would be okay.

As for the other questions, here are my thoughts. These are opinions only, mind, and not formed by experience:

* I struggle a lot with the idea of accidentally overwriting a proto-tulpa's personality, because I don't want a copy of myself. But I figure influence is inevitable. Same brain, and they're subjected to the limits of your own imagination. But if independence develops, then they'd have the opportunity to diverge and make their own choices, yes?
* Conflicting personalities, why not? We all have to deal with interpersonal differences, and different perspectives are good. As long as you're not creating two tulpas who exist just to hate each other, or are trying to force them to disagree.
* Writing about the tulpa's adventures, why not? A lot of people seem to do that. If they develop independence, you can ask them how they feel about it."
todayilearned,fbzbheg,t1_fbzad0y,1577241171.0,"I'm not familiar with that story or where it might've been, if it wasn't referring to Utah. I thought you meant what's commonly said about the Salt Lake Valley and the Wasatch Front. This land was never uninhabited (how could it be, realistically? It's one of the most resource-rich areas in the state, of course people lived here, all throughout it). Yet when I was in school in the 90s-2000s, it was still taught that Salt Lake Valley, Davis county, etc., were just sitting here waiting for the pioneers to show up to improve it with farms. It's utter fiction. I hope lessons on that part of the state's history have improved since then."

The ""well *technically*"" responses are useless in my eyes, as they skirt around what it's like to have a seemingly independent thought process from a seemingly separate and conscious individual.

You can tell yourself before bed or throughout the day that you'll see her in your dreams. It works best for me if I imitate a calm sense of confidence about it, as in I have to make myself really *feel* it in my gut that I will see someone. As strongly as if I had an appointment to keep with them.

You can also write down a script for how you want the dream to play out, and read it before bed. Similarly, you can just imagine the dream you want to have, while paying close attention to emotions. Writing down reminder notes or having alerts may help too. 

The main thing is to remain relaxed and patient, and to engage your emotions and senses, I think. It can take a while to work, or it can work immediately."

Tulpas,fdac0aq,t3_ek3tct,1578244364.0,"This is related to what'd happen when I first tried to create a female tulpa. I'm cis female, and I initially didn't want an opposite-gender situation. Partly due to my lack of insight into being male, but at the time it also seemed like people made opposite-gender tulpas for romantic reasons, and that's not something I'm remotely interested in.

However, I had very few positive relationships with female relatives and friends while growing up. So when I tried crafting the tulpa's personality, it kept resulting in some perfect mother/aunt/sister/best friend figure that was clearly a substitute for whatever I felt I'd missed out on. It felt fake and unhealthy (and boring! like a constant pity party). I didn't want this whole experiment to be defined by people in my past who'd let me down. It also brought to light a lot of internalized sexism. So I ended up switching to a male form for the proto-tulpa."

We're given a front row seat to watching their mouths physically speak the lines, while the background is diminished and blurred.

There's also the matter that it feels like you could switch a lot of the dialogue between characters, and it wouldn't make much of a difference. Or the tendency for the dialogue to narrate what's going on, instead of letting the actions speak for themselves. Like it's written to be a radio program instead of a TV show. That isn't *directly* about visuals, but connects with my own inability to get absorbed in the show and see the characters as distinct individuals, or as more than just actors delivering lines."

Otherwise, I'm continuing to struggle with bonding to most of the characters. Spoiler tags for negativity: >!My attention wandered a lot because of it (hence the need for a rewatch). The Doctor still feels like a lesser version and this bothers me the most. She's more indecisive and unassertive, doesn't seem as clever as her past selves. And the companions -- I just don't like them much even after all this time. They seem bland and two-dimensional. I'm not sensing that energy from previous companion-Doctor relationships, where the companions are a mix of excitement, fear, and curiosity, and the Doctor is delighted to show them around time & space, but with a sad awareness of possibly losing them. !<

That's why I settled on ""art's okay but only in the context of a larger post."" Instead of just no art. Since tulpamancy has creativity at its heart and it doesn't make sense to squash it entirely. (Not that anyone's taken advantage of it here yet, but still.)

Like you say though, validation rules above all else. A piece of art by itself doesn't contribute anything to tulpamancy, but people still get rewarded for it. Gratification over the pursuit of knowledge or meaning. It's a shame."

Tulpas,fclfirp,t1_fclf1gl,1577746605.0,Is presence tied to where you imagine them to be (like just picking a spot in the room) or do they determine that?

natureisterrible,fcj0qk8,t1_fcj0dp3,1577674407.0,"I don't think he was a psychopath. A lot of students from my college came from rural areas, and I heard similar stories from at least two others. This guy justified his actions because he said their horses would/could trip in the holes the rodents dug and could break their legs. And the cats were feral and thought of as vermin. He just grew up with that attitude around him.

Yeah, agreed."

(I don't enjoy gore or seeing pain, rather it's because reading about or seeing the reality of nature/life sometimes brings on this almost meditative and sad clarity, and this sense of being a witness.) That sub has a rule against tasteless humor though, so the conversations can sometimes be thought-provoking."

natureisterrible,fcish3a,t1_fcink1c,1577668744.0,"Dark humor is an important coping mechanism, but I don't see that as the driving element here. Maybe I'm cynical, but this feels far more like reddit's annoying culture of rewarding in-jokes and edginess above most else. Making it less about psychological defense and more about status seeking.

Tulpas,fc74ted,t1_fc72pfc,1577497548.0,"Yup, I've experienced much the same. If only that beginner's enthusiasm lasted forever! Given KenboCalrissian's more spontaneous forcing style, I wondered how that may have affected them.

I like the idea of four stages of learning for explaining the emotional struggles one goes through when pursuing a new passion. Stage 1, a person beginning something new is enthusiastic and highly committed. Stage 2, the person becomes disillusioned and feels like they have little to show for their efforts. Stage 3, the person realizes how much work needs to be done and they are full of self-doubt. Stage 4, they've become confident in their skill and commitment is high once more.

I think I'm bouncing between stage 2 and 3 right now."
todayilearned,fc7240p,t1_fc6zek7,1577495501.0,"Yes. However, in the United States at least, a claim that the majority of convicted are innocent appears to be quite false. One estimate for innocent prisoners in the United States is 6%, and innocent people confessing for the sake of plea bargains could be around 2-8% ([source](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kvj3d/why-are-there-up-to-120000-innocent-people-in-us-prisons)). The number of innocent prisoners on death row could be somewhere between 1.6-4.1% ([source](https://www.newsweek.com/one-25-executed-us-innocent-study-claims-248889)). Numbers which are unacceptably, horrendously high -- but still very far from being the majority.

Tulpas,fc629az,t1_fc5zsj9,1577470634.0,"Quite probably. Early successes would be exciting and could create an expectation of easy and natural development, and to then not have that expectation met could dampen hopes. (Even if, logically, you do know that it could take a lot of effort.)"

Tulpas,fc5xcaj,t1_fc5sjkg,1577467867.0,Have you had the problem of slow development outliving the passion?
Tulpas,fc5vgvs,t3_eg7ojm,1577466769.0,"I'm surprised some people think it's clearly wrong to put a proto-tulpa into a situation of conflict, since as KenboCalrissian says, role-playing and stories are reportedly a way for accidental tulpas to form. And there are creation guides out there that suggest imagining your tulpa in a variety of situations, as a method for strengthening personality traits. If you make it clear that it *is* a story -- a hypothetical scenario you're creating instead of a memory -- then surely that would be okay.

As for the other questions, here are my thoughts. These are opinions only, mind, and not formed by experience:

* I struggle a lot with the idea of accidentally overwriting a proto-tulpa's personality, because I don't want a copy of myself. But I figure influence is inevitable. Same brain, and they're subjected to the limits of your own imagination. But if independence develops, then they'd have the opportunity to diverge and make their own choices, yes?
* Conflicting personalities, why not? We all have to deal with interpersonal differences, and different perspectives are good. As long as you're not creating two tulpas who exist just to hate each other, or are trying to force them to disagree.
* Writing about the tulpa's adventures, why not? A lot of people seem to do that. If they develop independence, you can ask them how they feel about it."
todayilearned,fbzbheg,t1_fbzad0y,1577241171.0,"I'm not familiar with that story or where it might've been, if it wasn't referring to Utah. I thought you meant what's commonly said about the Salt Lake Valley and the Wasatch Front. This land was never uninhabited (how could it be, realistically? It's one of the most resource-rich areas in the state, of course people lived here, all throughout it). Yet when I was in school in the 90s-2000s, it was still taught that Salt Lake Valley, Davis county, etc., were just sitting here waiting for the pioneers to show up to improve it with farms. It's utter fiction. I hope lessons on that part of the state's history have improved since then."
