doordash_drivers,ff5mofs,t1_ff5is4y,1579600535.0,I make roughly $1400 a week doing doordash and GrubHub and only have to work 5 days a week. Also I don't know anyone who's done doordash for more than 2 years......
Documentaries,ff5kwrf,t1_ff5iqcv,1579597829.0,"""where you're from"". In California 1lb of chicken breast is $5.99. Cheeseburger at McDonald's is $1.50. Bag of Spinach is $5. Fries are $1. plus a lot of people have been raised on fast food since they were kids so that's all they are used to. Some people also are poor and don't have money to waste by experimenting with healthy  recipes that don't end up tasting good. 18th century peasants didn't have McDonalds or calorie rich foods that could purchase for cheap. Regardless of social status, people are way more sedentary than they were in medieval times. So this is what I mean by doing more research on the topic."
