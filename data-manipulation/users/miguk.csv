fragrance,ffz4pa7,t1_ffz4d0u,1580363885.0,"I got Givenchy Gentleman EdP for $44 last week. I haven't been back since. They still had several Serge Lutens (though less than usual), Givenchy, and Harmonist. They also had various testers, but none of their best. All Tom Fords, all AdPs, and almost all Replicas (including the good ones) are gone."

politics,ffvllqw,t1_ffvf0zn,1580267002.0,"Ron Paul? The guy who spend roughly a decade and a half publishing a 2-page newsletter filled with hate speech against gay, jewish, and black people?^(1) The guy whose most famous moment in the public eye was shouting ""he's a queer"" at Sacha Baron Cohen? The guy who voted against making MLK Jr Day a holiday? Don't lie to us; Paul is an obvious hatemonger, with ""the blacks"" (his words) being one of his prime targets.

^(1)Note: Paul admitted to being the writer in an interview in the 90s, but later pretended he didn't when he ran for POTUS. So on top of being a bigot, he also lies to his cultists.

Typical libertarian: this is all about your ego, not about the truth."
