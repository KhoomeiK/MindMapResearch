In Ft Lauderdale you've got Clovermint Cafe (I went twice in two days) and a food truck called vegan bruder that does brats/burgers (good but not life changing).
In Hollywood just south of Ft. Lauderdale I found a place called Vannucchi Bros pizza with an awesome menu of pizzas/pastas/sandwiches... take out/delivery style but awesome selection and they deliver.  Try the baked ziti!"
