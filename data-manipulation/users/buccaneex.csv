mycology,ffzqxsj,t3_ew56tq,1580390302.0,"So I live in middle Europe. This plant (Monstera Deliciosa) is inside. The top soil is just regular flower soil, but I am not sure about the rest. The stick was taken from my guinea pigs, they already chewed on it. The stick was cut of the tree about months or even a year ago. I sticked it in the soil a few days ago, today I noticed this... Just tell me, when you need more information."

houseplants,ffzor91,t1_ffznwu8,1580388301.0,"Okay. The top layer of soil is fresh but I dont know how old the rest of the soil is, I bought it only a couple of weeks ago. My plant is developing a new leaf rn (her 3rd) even though it is still winter. I am not that experienced yet. So would you wait to repot it until the leaf unfurled? Or just go ahead and do it now?"
houseplants,ffzodg6,t1_ffznl61,1580387927.0,I hope that is the cause. I'll do as you said. Thanks!

AskReddit,ffy6v97,t1_ffy62xi,1580339704.0,"Oh, I didn't was clearly enough, sorry. The girl is my best friend and the guy is my crush. Sorry for that misconception!

But what you are saying is basically the same, no matter the gender. I think I don't want to judge them. Man, this is all so confusing."
AskReddit,ffy311y,t3_evuaps,1580337595.0,"I met a dog, called him Flip. He sleeped on the beach and didn't trust humans. We slowly came closer to him and he let us cuddle him carefully.

A few days later we gave him some sausage to eat. Put it in pieces on a plate and put it in front of him on the ground. He didn't take any, I think he was to afraid of getting beaten. We gave him the food from the hand, then he took it but was very cautiousness.

Some day I walked side on side with him and some other camper shoosed him away aggressivly.

I still think about Flip from time to time. I wanted to take him home with me, but couldn't. It is not really a story but some moments that touched my heart deeply and still do whenever I think of them."

AskReddit,ffxymaz,t1_ffxxsgq,1580334988.0,"My dad had his own business when we were kids. I don't think that he had financial backup, but I can't say that for sure. After a few years he went back beeing an employee.

What I am saying is, you can always search yourself an regular job again if you are failing or don't like it as much as you think. But maybe I am a bit naive."
AskReddit,ffxxfg1,t1_ffxx7tx,1580334312.0,"I fear that, that I won't be able to see her in the same way I did ever again..."
AskReddit,ffxx5ih,t1_ffxw6uw,1580334160.0,"I am not angry on my best friend, I am just angry. Maybe I am angry on him, but that could be due to how he behaved after he got her. He just completely forgot about me, even though he wanted to stay friends with me a few weeks prior. But maybe I am just beeing sensitive... 

I think it is okay to be angry, it is an emotion I can't control after all. Or do you think about it in another way? 

But it would not be okay to interfere in their relationship somehow, and I surely won't do that. They should do what they want."

It just pisses me off and makes me angry. It is a shitty situation."
AskReddit,ffxvdys,t1_ffxv3ll,1580333169.0,"Haha, I hope that will happen someday. I don't know if he would have been the right one for me anyway..."
AskReddit,ffxv9vd,t1_ffxt6k6,1580333106.0,"Thank you. I think it is good to hear that it is normal that I am angry at her.

I respect that and their relationship, I won't interfere in their relationship, I have nothing to say in that, I am aware of that. But I can't be happy for them , nor do I want to hear anything about what they are doing together.."

I don't know what ""perpetual dibs"" are, but I think I get what you mean. Of course I don't have anything to say in their relationship but it is not really nice for me either rn because of that."
AskReddit,ffwnn5m,t1_ffwnc6w,1580306425.0,"Yeah, sounds shitty. I am in some kind of the same situation, but I don't know how I feel about that yet, so I kind of understand you."

AskReddit,ffv51sl,t1_ffus54x,1580255846.0,"This is sad. I hope and wish for you that (as far as you are still trying to get pregnant) it will work next time with no complications.

And you could try to get closer to one of your friends. Maybe try to be open-minded the next time you meet someone new, and try to be naive (not the best advice if the person is an arsehole, that's for sure...)  Sounds easy to me, but I suppose that it is a lot harder for you with trust issues. But the key word here is try! :) 

I wish you the best for your future!"
