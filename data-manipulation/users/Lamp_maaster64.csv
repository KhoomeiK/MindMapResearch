But I probably go out if business because candles, but the rich use my services."
depression,ff9egrt,t1_ff8i0gl,1579711258.0,"I thank you, right now it feels as if I don't care about anything. It might seem as selfish, but I feel as if I did so much, like I cut out a piece of my heart, only for it to be thrown in my face."
depression,ff299ub,t3_eqzk3k,1579497587.0,"I never asked to be here, my dad wanted kids in a time of need, dude showed up to my birth drunk, then complains about I, my brother, and my brother's daughter. When it was him who wanted us.

And I, like my own brother,nended up a mess, mainly because of him and my mother's idiotic choices."
depression,fewcpxr,t3_eophbs,1579408464.0,"I understand after reading your story. You lived a hard life, you stayed together, you survived for this long even though you felt numb, or sleeping walking on an ocean of happiness you can't baptize yourself in. You went through quite enough hardships.

If you want to speak, or talk, or vent, or ask questions, or anything, then please, feel free to talk to me, my schedule is free. Even if this might be buried

If you plan on staying a little longer, then maybe you can see Beetle Juice's super nova, since Beetle Juice(the nearest Giant Red) is at the end of its life span and will burst in a few years, it can be seen in Earth. Or as my Astronomy Teachers says."
depression,fe4jpy2,t3_eno7v3,1578860047.0,"My aunt, my dad, my mom saying I'm the daughter of a Goddess( my bro says shes not in the right mind).

But yea, they are as annoying as that one mosquito in your room, all you can do is put the blanket over your head and stuffer with the internal pain in your teeth"
depression,fdladt7,t3_elqwy9,1578519827.0,"My parents who are religous and fight on who's religion is right, my childhood that is filled with fake friends who betrayed my trust by stealing, lying, bullying, and just being racist, along with that one bitch bus driver who picked on me. Dad almost leaving us for another women and spent almost all of our savings on her(16k), only for her to die and him to crawl back and spend what pennies we had left on beer, and constant fighting between my parents that resulted my brother moving away from us. Parents playing the blame game.. School also played a part, I dont really trust teachers after a few. The bitch counselor that fucked me up mentally when I was like 4(I remember playing by myself and being quite, but after her I became spoiled and a mini monster because I didnt want to play with the other kids).

Right now its school and parents and please kill me"
