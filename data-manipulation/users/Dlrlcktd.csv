>""we do not have car chases"" is a general statement, I didn't say ""it absolutely never happens"", are you purposely retarded?

Yes, and your general statement was easily provably false.


>This is a classic case of ""I've got nothing better to say, so I'll pick out trivial parts of a sentence and bullshit my way around with semantics"".

I don't think you know what semantics means. You're the only person trying to argue semantics.

This is a classic case of ""I've been proven a liar, so I'm gonna try to insult my way out of it."""
