Assistance,fguadow,t1_fgu90ca,1581116072.0,"Cancer sucks.  Hope you get some good news or at least survivable news.  My daughter is a survivor of a childhood cancer.  Please don't feel needy or weird asking for a bit of help.  Most people want to do something. Not many people have a clue of what will actually help.

My biggest advice would be to try and think of what would help the most and talk to a few of your closest friends before you get into the thick of it.  It would also help you if someone was willing to run point for you.  It's really hard to go thru treatments and stay on top of not only your needs, but your mother's as well.  Chemo brain is very real.  

If you can't get someone to go to doctor visits with you, get all instructions in writing to help you keep track.  Keep a log of what meds you took and when.  You will forget (and that's normal).

Again, wish you the best of luck.  Feel free to reach out to me if you just want to chat. I'm just a random internet person so you don't need to feel like you're sharing too much."

NAH, you have every right to be upset and to want her to leave.  However, I can't say your wife is the AH because she wanted to be part of the discussion and process.  It didn't have to be immediate. On the other hand, I completely understand the knee-jerk get the hell out of my house!

I would talk to her again. Start by understanding why she is upset.  That doesn't make her right or you wrong.  You are just understanding how she could feel that way.  Then ask her to understand how you feel and why you reacted as you did.  It's so much easier to resolve issues when both of you can honestly understand why the other person behaved/felt as they did.

Thank you,"

You were too young to process the full impact at the time, but now as you process those memories you are having a hard time reconciling them.  Its important to understand that your adult brain is trying to process and make sense of your childhood experiences.

If this doesn't work, please carefully select a therapist. Be sure to say that your intention is to process this experience so you can move forward.
