For real though, it’s all about nutrition and it really is a lifestyle change. I would go as far to say that 80% of fitness is nutrition. Going to the gym, working out, and exercise are the easier parts, that’s 1-2 hours a day whereas you’re nutrition is all day every day. Find a diet that works for you, and I really encourage you to get a gym membership. My wife also really loved to do intermittent fasting too, that’s always worked really well for her."

nfl,ffd6qgh,t1_ffd1gdp,1579814500.0,"It was a pretty fucked up situation overall. Sadly we’ll never really know what happened. I think the reason the Chiefs kept Hill is because he cooperated with their investigations and didn’t really hide anything from the franchise. While they’re different situations and can’t really compare the two, but I think had Kareem Hunt told the truth to the chiefs, he’d still be a Chief today. 

That’s speculation of course, and again very different situations, but I think if you’re honest, (and sadly a good enough of a player), the franchise will keep you or stuck with you if they know the kind of crazy they have to work around. That’s all just my 2 cents and I could be very wrong but yeah that’s my thoughts on it"
