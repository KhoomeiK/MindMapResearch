mildlyinteresting,fev5iut,t1_fev30ck,1579393362.0,Been wondering that myself! Filled it up this morning. Maybe the expanding ice in the other slots forced it up? That seems like a stretch though.
taxpros,fejjyfk,t3_epd2k9,1579177367.0,Try Ladder Up. Provides free tax returns for low income people. Always looking for volunteers and they provide training.
tax,fei68j4,t1_feh69u8,1579131194.0,"I don’t think you can conclude that from what has been said. If there is no formal rent agreement and he is literally paying a portion of a mortgage on a house he doesn’t own, it could be considered a gift."
YouShouldKnow,feclxth,t1_feclex5,1578977178.0,"It’s not me being dismissive. It’s me trying to convince you that for people with children, a will is not just important, it’s a necessity. Obviously it’s not working.

Edit: also wills are not just for people who are dying - in fact it is strongly advised to not wait until that point, execute a will while you’re healthy."
YouShouldKnow,feckg9h,t1_fecg5v2,1578976097.0,"If you can afford a child, you can afford a will. They are not all thousands of dollars, and many people have pointed out resources for free online wills.  What would you do if your child became sick and you had to spend money on medical care? You’d find a way - even if it meant putting it on credit cards. I think the point of this post is that a will is equally important."
YouShouldKnow,fecjt26,t1_febugt8,1578975638.0,"Here’s a thought to help ease your mind: you’re still around. If they tried to take advantage of your personal information you would notice, and stop them (admittedly with some difficulty and cost). And more importantly, these are the people you’re potentially entrusting with your children. If you can’t trust them with your personal info while you’re alive, you shouldn’t trust them with your children after your dead. Sounds like you chose good people."
AbsoluteUnits,fd960ws,t3_ek7j00,1578228921.0,"Dude’s obviously a monster, why does wear a t-shirt with pre-printed abs?"
news,fd6wc4x,t1_fd5ywgl,1578196550.0,That’s a fair point. I still think there are situations where broadcasting the truth is ok but maybe not as often as I originally thought.
news,fd34zmy,t1_fd1yh13,1578154770.0,"You had me until lies or truth... nothing wrong with the truth in most situations (other than doxxing, etc)"
harrypotter,fd2ohxi,t1_fczo7nq,1578150125.0,"The first chapter of HBP, where Fudge introduces the Prime Minister to the new Minister for Magic. Told from the perspective of the Prime Minister."
harrypotter,fcwlyey,t1_fcwcjqh,1578029349.0,The Other Minister is so great!
Columbus,fcupiko,t1_fcujnsa,1577985909.0,Yes exactly! Also many gyms prohibit using phones in the changing rooms after this famous case where a model purposely took a picture of someone else changing to mock them:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-us-canada-40038332
fantasyfootball,fa9wmye,t3_e83c3c,1575894858.0,Thanks for posting this. In my league we all went to bed thinking one matchup was decided 123-118 and woke up this morning to it being 117-118.  Thought it might be because of a D/ST adjustment but couldn’t remember what they were showing for the Steelers D yesterday.
