If that works for you, that's great. You won't always get everything immediately, though. Some things may need time to click, so it's OK if you don't understand every single thing you are doing.

I think all programmers should learn at least a bit of C at some point. Starting with C sounds hard, but it's fine if you can do it.

> I understand that there are correct new methods on how to code in C in 2020, do you guys recommend me to learn that after I mastered C or before?

If you mean the latest standard (C18), few things change between versions of the C standard. I don't think you have to worry about that."
