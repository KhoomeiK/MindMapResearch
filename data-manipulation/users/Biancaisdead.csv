bipolar,fep1asw,t3_epzq0r,1579309911.0,Weeeeee!! Just replace therapist with friends.  I still can’t find a therapist that can think outside of the cbt/dbt lazy box they all cling to now.

bipolar,feafiwg,t3_eo2w4u,1578948090.0,I’m still on 150mg of Wellbutrin.  I’m still cycling and spinning my wheels in place. I got an hour and a half of sleep last night and I’m just not seeing a point in being around for any of this anymore.  It’s the same cycles over and over and I don’t ever get to leave and can’t get better.

bipolar,fczi2ut,t3_ejng4r,1578101729.0,"That my ongoing daydreams are the closest I’m ever gonna get to healthy close relationships and being able to live independently.

I’m so overwhelmed right now.  I’ve been looking at certifications because I can’t find any jobs that will pay enough to support the basics.  I can’t apply for loans because a bout of mania in my late 20’s put me 16k in debt with student loans and nothing to show for it.  I’m considering selling my car.  I feel hella desperate.

My family unfortunately are a bunch of crabs in a bucket.  I forget this frequently and it’s always a rude reminder.  My friends mean well, but they are very flakey.  I feel like I need a chart just to keep track of all the different boundaries I’ve had to set.  My friendship expectations aren’t codependent; I guess I just don’t meet enough people organically to click with people who also have healthy expectations.  I don’t think what I’m looking for romantically exists; I have a long list of dealbreakers.  I refuse to download apps and using meetup feels creepy and wrong.  I’m probably just too picky, but it can’t be helped."

One of my coworkers resented me because he had made her work her way up through the greenhouse before she got to design.  I actually wanted to be in the greenhouse more - less attitude and less the soundtrack to Chicago on repeat.
I hope you get a great buyer soon!  It seems you have to either be creative or odd to own a shop; I’ve got my fingers crossed for the first option"

If I ever win the lottery I’m opening up my own shop and the only requirement to work there is you have to be NICE.  It’s like being pleasant is a fucking crime in that industry."
