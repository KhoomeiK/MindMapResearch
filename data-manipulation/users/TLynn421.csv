quittingkratom,ffdefxb,t1_ffd7pfc,1579819151.0,"I'm in NC and actually had to do a 2 week Suboxone taper to get off them. I'm done with the Suboxone...it was only 2 weeks but absolutely scary wondering to myself why in the hell it took Suboxone to quit. I've never even tried a Roxy or Methadone. From what I've heard, they've pulled all of that crap."
AskPsychiatry,ffczab6,t3_esy7v3,1579810335.0,I've taken the same mg of that same medication as well for years and if you provide a solid printout from your pharmacy of your history the new psych will be more likely to work with you.
illnessfakersgonewild,ffbpv2m,t1_ffb61m4,1579777748.0,Yes! Lock me in a dark damp cave for all I care. Just no light is all I ask!
illnessfakersgonewild,ffbprzp,t1_ffblwp7,1579777627.0,"Hey I know how you feel... there's this Imitrex (I think I misspelled it) injection that you can get that saved me because I was missing soooo much work due to chronic migraines. At the first indication of a migraine, you give yourself a little injection and in a matter of minutes it's almost gone! Also... sucking on spearmint candies helps a lot. So strange but true!"

depression,ff9239v,t1_ff9181b,1579702936.0,"Hey I know what you mean...just the THOUGHT of dealing with shit for another 5 years, or even the rest of our lives almost seems hopeless, but I promise, there is a way to not only survive, but flourish. I've attempted suicide multiple times. It's cost me so much. The last time was a result of finding out some devastating things about my now Ex husband. I got divorced and lost my health insurance, and in turn lost my job and was essentially homeless. This was 2 years ago. Several other horrific things followed. I decided to move. I moved to a city where I knew NO ONE. I didn't have a car or even a job. I moved into a house where I rented a room and got a job at Starbucks. Started saving money and eventually got an apartment with a friend. Then I met the love of my life on a fluke. He gave me the strength I needed to believe in myself again. I finally saw a doctor for the first time in this new city and got on psych meds. It's been trial and error, but it's getting better. I now work for a major energy company and we just bought our 1st home a couple of months ago. He and I are fighting like hell for our lives and what we deserve. This is what you deserve. I'm just explaining how things can change for the better on the drop of a hat. You just need a change."
depression,ff9150p,t3_esbfsf,1579702220.0,"I've been where you're at... I'm so incredibly sorry that you are suffering like this. I'm at my wit's end with my depression and anxiety as my doc and I have been trying different meds and it's beyond frustrating. It's incredible to think about how some people just wake up ""normal"" or ""happy"". That blows my mind. But...I saw a quote and forgive me as I don't recall it entirely or who said it, but it helped. It discussed how we don't necessarily want to die...we just want the life we know to end. If someone knows which quote this is please post! It just clicked with me that it was true. Please, life can change so quickly, and a year from now so many things could be better. There just needs to be a change."
depression,ff8zznw,t3_es23mi,1579701319.0,"Mental health days are so underrated. When we're physically sick (like I am now... been out a week today) we stay home, take meds, and get well. Why is it so taboo in the workplace to do the same when it comes to mental health? Yeah I get it...no one is going to catch my PTSD or MDD, but shouldn't mental health prosperity be paramount? I've had to leave the office early due to an anxiety attack as well. I hate the looks I get the next day from colleagues that were aware of what happened. It's not a look of concern or sincerity, but of almost pity, or even worse, fear. I'm glad you took the day for yourself OP. I feel like if this were encouraged more, and the stigma around it would disappear, the workplace would be a generally better place."

TrueOffMyChest,fegw0w0,t1_fegq64z,1579103793.0,I 100% agree with you on this!
TrueOffMyChest,fege7h2,t1_fefi6tn,1579089633.0,"This!! I'm SO tired of seeing so many moms wearing their ""I need my wine"" shirts or carrying their tumblers that say ""this is my get through (insert child's sport) practice juice"". Why is being an alcoholic parent normalized and even humorous enough to be plastered everywhere?  My childhood was not humorous in any way as these glamorized shirts and tumblers lead people to believe."
TrueOffMyChest,fdshf5m,t1_fdsbblc,1578702807.0,I just wished that they could somehow grasp the impact they will have on the population. Or how babies that are too young to be vaccinated are exceptionally at risk and could possibly become fatally ill due to their beliefs! It's ridiculous! By the way...are you doing alright with your autoimmune? I'm coming out of remission and I'm miserable!

TrueOffMyChest,fdro09l,t1_fdrd8mq,1578687242.0,I am right there with you on moonwalking!   These people refuse to accept that the whole autism theory was debunked years ago!
TrueOffMyChest,fdonm63,t3_emfg67,1578608827.0,"I might catch hell for saying this; not only do I agree 100% with you, especially since I have an autoimmune disease, but the typical argument of the anti-vaxxer doesn't even make sense. They're essentially saying that they would prefer a dead child over an Autistic child...ya know, since most of them believe Jenny McCarthy."
AskPsychiatry,fdelegw,t3_ekz4jh,1578341497.0,"I'm not a physician however I am a very long time psych patient as I have MDD, GAD, and PTSD. I wouldn't take one because you will want your psychiatrist to see you as you exactly are... unmedicated, so that they can provide a clearer and more accurate diagnosis. Just my advice. Good luck!"
AmItheAsshole,fczcrn0,t3_ejlu9q,1578098318.0,"NTA. My best friend is going through something similar. Her bf is stealing her Xanax with no regard that she is dependent on them and that WD could cause seizures.  At the end of the day it's theft of a narcotic substance. That's yours! And no, you ""can't get more"" and ""everything"" won't be okay. The days you have to go without...well your pain will steadily increase as all the medication wears off. Once you get a refill (fingers crossed) it will take more medication just to get you somewhat comfortable. Speaking from experience myself.  I would absolutely hide my meds if I were you."
TwoXChromosomes,fcw475x,t1_fcw2wuq,1578016756.0,"I'm unsure what you're saying...but yes he's the only one. Neither girl knew about each other and came together once they discovered that they both had been lied to. So yes, the guy is the only POS based on what we know."

relationships,fcvf53m,t3_ej1gol,1578000794.0,I will say this in regards to his sudden outbursts and mood swings...that could be an indication that he is cheating. Often times this happens when the person they're cheating with does or says something that upsets them. Then they typically find an excuse to leave home in an effort to reconcile with the mistress.  I'm so sorry that you're going through this.
