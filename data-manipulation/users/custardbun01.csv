cars,feg8d7i,t3_eowgz5,1579081905.0,I often feel like asking people questions like this will more often than not result in an answer like “best decision I ever made” or “don’t regret it one bit” or whatnot simply because most people don’t want to admit they made the wrong decision spending a car’s worth of money on something.

modernwarfare,fe7fv8f,t3_ent5yh,1578914102.0,Agree 100%. It’s the guys who can’t tolerate dying once or losing a game that complain. They want to go 50 and 5 every match or otherwise the game is shit.
AppleWatch,fdsil4z,t3_emzmqk,1578703436.0,Depends how desperate for cash you are I think you should just keep it. It’ll be supported and last longer than the 3 with the processor upgrade and my 5 compared to my friend’s 3 is faster and more seamless overall.

The issue when these people talk about oppression, they think shit like people commenting or watching on their own weight or not wanting to fuck their ugly fat ass is oppression."
SonyAlpha,fddftew,t3_ekj6xt,1578310359.0,Have you found the purple but that broke off? I’ve fixed many similarly small things with super glue before - it should hold well and you can try applying it with a toothpick. But you’ll obviously need to be careful using it here given it’s proximity to the battery.

SonyAlpha,fc6hy5p,t3_eekfib,1577481000.0,"Hi all, I’m having a bit of motion blur trouble with my new a6400 and shooting long exposures of the night sky. I’m a relative beginner but been fiddling around with digital cameras for a few years and know the basics on how to set up a proper long exposure shot. 

I came from a NEX6 to an A6400 earlier this year. I took some great night and long exposure shots on the NEX6 including of the night sky, where I got a full, detailed and clear picture of the stars. 

However on my A6400 I can’t take a single shot without motion blur. I’ve tried a few times at a few destinations with a few set ups. I’ve tried longer and shorter exposure times, tripods, resting on the ground, different lenses and other settings. The blur is always the same. It goes diagonally down from left to right. I thought it might be the shutter? Or could something be wrong with the camera?"

melbourne,fc3vfnl,t1_fc3kxmo,1577399638.0,It’s not the growth it’s the lack of foresight and planning to deal with it. Population growth projections haven’t changed all that much for years but they’ve been ignored by city planners and governments for ages. They’ve just let things get massively crowded and their solution is just a few new roads and freeways like transport is the only problem.
melbourne,fc3v9yw,t3_eg002u,1577399524.0,Worst: homelessness epidemic. Successive governments have failed to address it. It’s a failure in both mental health services and social housing and it’s a stain on the city.
