You can hear his story doesn’t mean you have to believe it. You can make that decision. Also having an open line of contact with him means you can get things like family medical history. I know you don’t want anything to do with him now, but family history can be important. 

Also, what he did has nothing to do with DNA.  You’re still the amazing person today you were yesterday. Nothing changed that. He made bad choices but it’s not dna that determines that stuff. 

I’d honestly give him a chance to speak over whatever way he contacted you. Let him give his side of things and go from there. People change, especially over 20 years. You may be surprised at how things go. If it starts to get ugly there’s always a restraining order."

Showerthoughts,ffjmzy7,t1_ffjlu5l,1580002005.0,"The reason coors and Budweiser do so well is definitely because of their heritage. They have been widely available across the US for decades now. In addition to that when I go to a bar that has 50 beer choices and 40 of them I’ve never heard of I know coors light is a safe choice. In addition to that since we grew up with our grandparents drinking Budweiser and coors, our parents drinking them, so a lot of us drank them. My fridge growing up always had Budweiser in it. So when I tried beer it was always shaped to taste like what I was used to. 

Now this isn’t to say that’s how I still am. I prefer coors light over any of the bud, coors, or miller varieties. For me it’s got a legacy, plus it’s cheap, easily found, and commonly accepted.  I definitely enjoy craft beers though. I go to breweries often and I never get a popular beer, I always go for the craft beers to try new things. And yes they generally taste better than coors light. 

On any given river trip I can guarantee that 3/4 of the beer or more is coors light (sometimes bud light as well but for the sake of simplicity I’ll put bud and coors light in the same category). I’ll grab a few craft beers that I like and people can bring the craft beers they like HOWEVER THEY MUST BE IN A CAN. Which can make it harder to find craft beers. It’s a general rule that all trips require cans of beer no glass because we don’t want any broken glass  at the river, on the boat, at the beach, or where we camp.  The reason why coors is so popular even though we all generally have another beer we enjoy more? Well for one you can drink a ton of it. Number two even though we all like certain crafts more it’s a common thing that everyone enjoys coors. So the craft I like most girls hate. And a lot of people love the fruity craft beers and I hate those. So by getting mostly coors everyone is happy. If there were beers that EVERYONE thought was better tasting than coors light it would take over and well more than coors. The reason coors and bud is so popular is because as a whole those are the beers that taste best to everyone."
Showerthoughts,ffjltrp,t1_ffjkgh8,1580001211.0,"Eh Coronas aren't bad though. Like when it comes to Mexican beer it’s definitely my favorite. That being said I don’t drink them often either. Basically when I go out for taco Tuesday and they are sale I get them. They pair with street tacos much better than a coors light as well. 

In fact like most people when I first started drinking beer I HATED it. I remember going to parties at like 18 and I didn’t even want play beer pong because I didn’t want to drink the beer. I had no problems drinking hard liquor because it was a small amount and it was fast. Sometimes I’d even pour it into a cup instead of a shot glass so I could drink like 2-3 shots of Jager or Tequilla chase it with a coke and be recovered from the taste after 30 seconds and have enough hitting me to get me drunk. When I first started drinking beer Coronas were the only ones I could actually enjoy. These days I enjoy pretty much all beer.  It’s an acquired taste for sure. Nothing like working your ass off all day to make a beer taste amazing."

Called in his superior and was like you’re fucked. His boss got there and checked everything out went over who had how many. He asked my buddy “did you know you shot over the limit or was it a mistake” he was like honest to God mistake. The warden looked in his bag again and goes here’s the problem you didn’t shoot this one he did and put it in my others buddies bag.  He then ripped his officer a new one.

CarAV,ffess19,t3_et82t2,1579863803.0,"So that decision is up to you for the distribution block. You can run 2 cables if you’d like all the back or you can run just 1. For all intents and purposes we can just say that total power needed for those two amps would be about the same as a single 2000 watt amp. I think you have your ratings mixed up because no amp should be doing 800@2 ohms and 1200@4 ohms. If the numbers were the other way swapping the 2 and 4 ohms that would make more sense.  Now that I think about this it’s probably best you link your actual amp so we can really see what it puts out. For this we will make the assumption that it puts out 1500 watts max at 1ohm just for simplicity. 

Ok so assuming you’re doing separate wires front to back no distribution box you can run the big mono amp off 2g and then the 4 channel off 8g. I’d probably bump the 4 channel to 4g for safety but it would be fine. If you wanted a better install and only running 1 power wire you could do 0g. It would be thicker so harder to hide but cleaner in the end. Run that to a distribution box then do a short run of 2g to the big amp and 4g to the small amp.  This is up to you and either way you do it it won’t matter quality wise just how you like your look. I think 2 wires could be simpler but 1 wire looks better especially when everything is super clean out back. Make sure that if you use a distribution box you have the 0g fuses at the total of what both amps need and the box you use has glass fuses with the appropriate fuses for each wire exiting. 

Always use copper cable not aluminum. It’s not to say that aluminum can’t work l, but it doesn’t last as long and if you go aluminum you need to make the wires bigger. The values I gave are for copper if you went aluminum (bad choice but will still work) I’d go 0g straight to the big amp and 4g to the 4 channel minimum. 

As far as ohms go this is generally where we look at subs. The lower the ohm the more power your amp will put out. That’s why I said I doubt your amp will put out more at 4ohm than at 2ohm. Ohm is resistance. So when you go from 2ohm to 4ohm it doubles the resistance. An amplifier puts out a set amount of power. Now let’s say it puts out 1000 watts at 1ohm. If you hook up speakers at 1ohm you get all 1000 watts. If it’s 2ohms you have doubled the resistance so it’s only going to put out half as much power. So you’d be looking at about 500 watts. The amp is still turning out the same power but the because of the resistance the subs only get half the power. Make the jump to 4ohms and it’s got 4 times the resistance so you’re only getting 250 watts of power. 

So I’d recommend 2ohm if you can so that you can get more power out of your amp. My recommendations have a lot of unknowns of your system so it’s best guess work. If you want some more assurances I need to know exactly what amp you have, what subs you’re using and how many.  Then I can give you absolutes. Otherwise we have to go based off what we think which may not be accurate. That amp may actually put out 800 watts at 4ohm 1200 watts at 2 ohm and 1600-2000 watts at 1ohm or more. It could be RMS rated power or peak power which would matter a lot. If it can go down to 1ohm and you have 2 dial voice coil subs we could run it at 1ohm depending on how you wire it and make a TON of power. Your subs may not be able to take all the power then you run them at 2ohm with some trick wiring. It all depends. My guesses are based of assumptions and a single subwoofer."

CarAV,ffeogd9,t3_essi4c,1579857350.0,Back in the day as sort of a joke/theft deterrent I had a small amp that was mounted to my trunk and it looked like it was the amp that powered my subs. It was a cheap crappy amp that was like a starter amp from my first set up. It was a pep boys special. My real amp was hidden under some paneling. My hope was if they tried to steal my subs and or my amp they’d take that crappy 40 dollar amp and not my amp that cost a few hundred. It was sooo funny though when people would hear my system and want to see it (friends) and I had these cool subs and a amp that looked like shit that said 2X200 on it. Yet my speakers pounded.

CarAV,ffasiaa,t1_ffakvsx,1579743468.0,Jesus that’s crazy.

Then the line to the amp is less than 10 feet long generally. What’s it doing up in the apilar. My lines go through a gromet on the fire wall then under the carpet into the back seat.

CarAV,ffahgql,t1_ff9s2xj,1579735833.0,"Shouldn’t the distribution block have fuses built in? I know on the 5 I own and use throughout my toys each one of them had the wire that comes in and then it had let’s say 3 outs. On mine each wire out requires it’s own glass fuse to complete the circuit. Which is rad because you can put the right fuse in to make sure it’s fused appropriately rather than having a heavy duty fuse off the battery that is strong enough to support all the electronics but one alone can’t trip. It shouldn’t require putting extra fuses in-line it should be part of it. 

I don’t even put a fuse between the battery and block because odds are if something happened it wouldn’t be able to blow it anyways. I just use the distribution block and it’s fuses."

Then the dudes driving the ambulance would get paid like 14 bucks an hour. Also if I’m dying and you have to send trained medical professionals to my house to save me, please pay them appropriately. I think the people driving the ambulance and doing the work are worth it. How you can change 2000 for the ride and only pay the people 15 bucks an hour is ridiculous. I’d rather be changed 2050 and have the guys make 40 an hour and actually be excited to be at work rather than stressing how they are going to pay their bills.

CarAV,ff8jp2z,t1_ff7iw5j,1579681666.0,"You really can, but a capacitor generally holds a lot more amperage than a standard battery.  I've actually intentionally welded with auto batteries out in the desert.  We have an older sand rail that has a VW bug engine and a RZR that we take out.  We always take both if we are going more than 2-3 miles from camp just incase something happens.  Engine breaks down or belt breaks whatever we can not be stranded.  The sand rail actually has two batteries on board and they are both hooked up, however I can disconnect one or the other with a simple lever.  Now this was done so when we are out at night and lets say we are shooting, bbq'ing, or having a bonfire, I can disconnect one of the batteries so that if the light bars kill the battery I can just use the other battery. 

Well there is another important reason I have both of the batteries on board.  The rail is older and from time to time we break welds.  It's not always a big deal but sometimes its not very safe to continue like that.  I have a little tool box on board under the back deck that has some basic supplies in it.  One of the things it had was a coat hanger (it has a few welding rods now) and jumper cables.  You can get a decent weld to get the rail back together decent enough to get back to camp safely.  Some of my welds with the cables while ugly as sin compared to my Tig welder at home have come out so strong that I just leave them and they have never broken haha."
sugargliders,ff8jc87,t1_ff6x0gh,1579681160.0,You have to introduce them correctly.  The general way is to put them in separate enclosures and the enclosures next to each other.  Make them neighbors for a while.  Eventually they start to hang out with each other and try to get close in a friendly way instead of trying to fight each other.  Then you can push the cages right up on each other instead of having a small gap.  If they try to fight you pull the cage apart real easy.  If they try to be friendly for a while and no fights break out over a couple of days then you can try putting them inside of the same enclosure.

In addition to that you can actually look into modifying what you have to make things work better. I’d check out the sound deadening in the truck and see how they do it. Did they do the panels or the back seat and rear deck. 

I’ve heard of guys putting sound deadening in the panels and removing the sound deadening in the rear dead and back seat. You can also look into giving the sound a place to go. I’ve heard of guys modifying things like putting cut outs in the rear deck so that the space isn’t sealed off anymore and sound can travel through into the car. 

Your biggest hurdle is basically they did everything they could so sound in the truck couldn’t get into the car. You have to make it so it can. Otherwise you have to supply way more power than normal."
CarAV,ff695hl,t1_ff61z9o,1579622051.0,"Plus aren’t batteries loads safer.  There’s been many stories of people hurting themselves with capacitors.  If you handle it improperly while it’s not discharged it can deal out quite a shock. I don’t know if anyone dying from it but it wouldn’t shock me (see what I did there) if someone has.  I knew of someone that got a small shock and then welded a wrench to the side of their car and screwed up a bunch of stuff because the capacitor wasn’t discharged properly and they were trying to disconnect it to remove it because it was dangerous (the irony) and while the wrench was on the positive terminal they touched a piece of metal which caused it to ground. They got shocked and let go but the wrench completed the circuit from the hot of the capacitor to the ground of the cars sheet metal. It made the wrench glow red and got so hot that it welded the wrench to the capacitor and the metal of the car.

As well as some head units can cost an easy thousand with even cheaper ones being 300+. My amp does 1200+ watts RMS at 1ohm and I paid like 180 bucks for it.

CarAV,ff671sl,t1_ff62750,1579620665.0,"For sure. The build I’m currently rocking is in no way my best build or my most expensive. All of the stuff in my truck has been scavenged from other stuff I’ve done over the years and it’s hilarious, yet it actually has come together to make a pretty solid stereo. My head unit came out of a car I crashed 5 years ago. My subs I bought about 5 years ago off craigslist for 50 dollars. Yes 50 bucks for both 10” subwoofers in a box. My front door speakers I’m not even sure where they came from I don’t remember ever buying them I found them in my garage. My rears were bought for a golf cart a few years back that never got installed. They happen to match the fronts though which is weird because they weren’t bought together but I like Polk audio stuff so they actually matched. So all of my speakers are currently Polk. The amp that drives my subs was from a car that went into the truck with head unit that went into a Camaro then a g35 then another Camaro, and now my new truck. 

When all is said and done though I have a pioneer double din touch screen, full Polk speakers, 2 10” Polk subs and a 2000 watt rocksford as fosgate amp that puts out over 1200 watts at 1ohm rms. The total cost for putting it in this truck was just under 200 bucks for the box under the back seat, wiring (including amp kit) and the dash kit. Yet it’s been one of the most fun set ups and like I said for how it went together it sounds really good.

CarAV,ferhghb,t1_fer6geg,1579353910.0,"I did my head unit on flat. And I don’t have a line driver. 

The base boost is the one on the amp. I wasn’t using it to start but I was having like a weird zone that I just couldn’t get it to go into. That 30-40volt range. I could adjust the gain slowly and get it to do like 24 volts then bump to 26 volts but for some reason when I went from 29 just the tiniest little bit and bam 40+ volts. I fiddled with the bass boost since they are subs and basically it seemed to work like a mini gain but it was much less sensitive. So I could set it at 29 then add a little bass boost and get the voltage where I wanted it at like 35 ish. 

So here’s the test tone I was using. I realize it’s probably not perfect but I play all audio from Spotify on my phone. 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_TV2BIOOgeU

So for the set up it’s decent but nothing spectacular. It’s 2 10” single voice coil Polk subwoofers. They are 4ohm and rated at 300watts rms and 600 watts peak. I got them for a deal on Craigslist with plans for something else but due to small space I ended up taking the 12’s I usually use in my cars and put those in my boat and used the 10’s out of the boat for this for now. I plan to upgrade to Skar 10” SVR dual voice coils at 4ohm. 

For an amp I have my R&F 2000 watt amp. Really it’s 1k @ 1ohm, 500 @ 2ohm, and 250 @ 4ohm rms. However like I said according to the multimeter and voltage readings it’s putting out way more. V=sqr(watts X ohm). My speakers are set up in parallel so it’s a total load of 2ohm verified by the multimeter. I was pulling upwards of 55-60 volts and max settings with that tone just to check what the voltage would say because I was getting higher readings than expected. 

What’s expected would be at max. Looking at my set up I should max out at about 32 volts. That’s 1000 watts rms at 1 ohm or 500 at 2 ohm according to the math. So when I was seeing 45 volts according to the math that’s 1012.5 watts which is double what it’s rated for. That’s basically peak but it continued to push it no problem. That’s when I maxed it out for a second to see what it would do and it was bouncing between 55-60.  I cut it short because I didn’t wanna blow the amp but my God at 55 volts the math checks out to 1500 watts at 2ohm which is triple the rms and 50% more than peak. Which is insanity.

In addition to that my speakers which are supposed to want 24.49 volts to be at their 300 watt RMS, they wanted 35-40 before they started to slightly distort I’m talking SLIGHT. Which is 600-800 watts with 600 being their max. 

Now I know these companies like R&F and Polk are big names in the industry. It’s not like a Boss amp where you expect if the amp says it puts out 1k rms you’re really going to get 500 watts rms. If Polk or R&F say you’re getting 1k rms you should expect 1k rms or even more because they under rate so you can be sure you get what they say you will. However an amp that can push over 3k watts via voltage that’s rated at 2k peak (I’m running 2ohm for now so it’s 1500 at least peak when at peak it should make 1000) and subwoofers that like to be ran at 600+  watts when they are 300rms is confusing. I feel like I must be making a mistake somewhere in the math or that combo is massively under rated. 

After these adjustments I went out for the evening. I drive a total of 35 miles each way to and from which was about a 40 minute drive each way. I checked out the speakers upon arriving at my destination and back home. I played reggae which is pretty bass heavy at 75-80% volume really getting down in the truck. Upon arrival my subs were cool to the touch (at or close to ambient temperature), they had absolutely no smell, no signs of smoke, and the whole time they never had any noticeable distortion. I’m not a snob where it has to sound perfectly clear like a set up with 5000 dollars invested with focals, but I can’t handle any distortion.  Now since it was only at 75% volume they were putting out probably about 30 volts which is 450 watts calculated from basic math. Now that’s 50% over RMS and it took that for 40 minutes straight twice in a row with out any signs of struggle. 

I’m wondering is that ok to run it like that? Why is it putting out so much voltage. I can push the subs harder than that with no issues but since I’m already so far over it feels like playing with Fire. I know that my music is dynamic and a 40hz test tone is constant and stressed subs out so it’s not surprising it can handle a little more, but the subs seem to want a lot more. 


Sorry for the long ramble but I hope that answered any questions you may have, gives you an insight to my thought process, and clearly explains my thoughts. 

TLDR: if V=sqr(watts X ohm) why is my set up pushing way more power than peak and holding more power than RMS without clipping."

When people ask why I don’t want kids it’s because I don’t want to be responsible for making more humans have to live with crazies like this. These snowflakes truly believe Trump is Hitler, the police is the SS, and they are Jews. 

We have a lot of issues. I’m not saying Trump or the Police are good  even. I’m saying that these people are crazy in their thoughts we are going to be attacked and murdered. 

If you call 911 in America the police don’t even really respond depending on the incident. For this no police would respond. The respond to medic calls where there was violence, death, or a car crash mostly."
gaming,fdux70m,t1_fduviqm,1578740387.0,"So it’s kind of how cell phones work. When you dial 911 on a landline it knows where that phone is and connects you to the right department. When you call on a cell phone it’s pretty amazing. It tries to do an instant geo location and dial to what it thinks the best police department to call is. They are generally pretty good about getting the right location. 

Next part. Each police department had a regular phone number for their emergency line. When you dial 911 it works more like a speed dial rather than just 911 being the number. 

So last part if you call emergency services in England emergency or non emergency line. You tell them the address you need to send help to. Even if it’s not even close to them they are going to be able to look up the department that you should be calling. For them it’s a simple one moment please and they transfer you to the emergency line of the correct police department just like forwarding a normal call. 

The hardest part would be figuring out how to make international calls. Once you figure that out dial any police station in England and you’ll get to the right people within minutes."
AskReddit,fduhjwc,t1_fdu2ucb,1578733087.0,"I assume as an officer you come across money quite often (multiple times daily). I’m addition to that you must come across larger sums as a department quite frequently (20-50+ bills from drugs, prostitutes, or whatever). It seems like a money counting machine is a must. They are super accurate especially if you run the cash 3 times and it comes up the same all 3 times. I couldn’t imagine paying a dude to count money all the time by hand. Where I live officers make between 30-50 an hour on the low end.  Rather than paying an officer 30 an hour for 5 hours to count money, a money counting machine just seems cheaper and a much better investment. Plus I want my officers to get stuff done not become a bank teller with a gun."
CarAV,fdugp72,t1_fduamfe,1578732692.0,This I always cut if off and put my own adapters because I never go back to stock. However if you want that ability to I’d buy the connectors. If you throw some speakers in and your total investment is 150 bucks just cut it off. If you do some rad components and tweeters and spend 1000+ the connectors are the way to go so you can revert it back to stock if you sell it. You could even cut it take your expensive components out and buy some 40 dollar coax pioneers or similar and throw those in.
