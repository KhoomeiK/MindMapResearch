happycryingdads,fdjlnez,t1_fdhl5h8,1578476814.0,"It's the unexpected things that make you cry. I've seen a lot of emotional movies and video clips and I've heard a bunch of emotional songs but the first time I cried in years was when I was walking home from a party and just was thinking of my friends and what they've done for me. I simply broke down, went on a playground and cried for ten minutes straight. The feeling of all your emotions suddenly being released is something otherworldly and I'm happy for everyone who can experience this."
