nosleep,ffde6fe,t3_eswqyf,1579818994.0,Brilliant.  This would make an excellent short film too.  You painted cinematic pictures in my head.
kraftwerk,ffd4t33,t1_ffd1o3d,1579813426.0,"For 73 he's looking pretty darned good - all of those years of cycling really served him well.  Unfortunately, I just wonder how much touring a band of guys in their sixth and seventh decade will want to tolerate?  I guess I wish them continued good health so they can crank out another studio record before they pack it in."
kraftwerk,ffd1cf0,t3_esy0rz,1579811478.0,To be honest knowing those guys that would be the last thing they would remaster if it was their product to release/. It was t really a Kraftwerk record.  I would like to see 1/2/Ralf & Florian released in a remastered form.
insanepeoplefacebook,ffcjkux,t3_esq3bo,1579800835.0,Great.  Started as a slightly naive and maybe a bit offensive person who wasn't aware of a certain country then all of a sudden it went off the rails.

RBI,ff79gr3,t1_ff741go,1579643843.0,I did - the person who owned the doorbell chose not to interact with the people whereas I might have.  I've had weird experiences with Ring doorbells myself - a neighbor had left for the day leaving their new puppy in a fenced backyard and since puppies have bones of rubber he easily wormed out of his enclosure and was freaking out whining and yipping.   I tried to contact the people through their ring and it was obvious they were driving far north of our areas since the cell reception was iffy at best.   I managed to get the pup back into his enclosure but if I see that again that's something I'd call the cops on.  Bring the pup with you on your trip or having someone watching over the little guy.  He was completely terrified and freaking out.
RBI,ff73r7q,t1_ff6ujzh,1579640528.0,"Not a felony to take a picture but consider this person has a lake home.  The presumption is the person isn't populating the premises 100% of the time.  Places like these are attractive to thieves.  You can choose to believe these are innocent interactions - if I had a ring or similar I'd say ""how may I help you?"" and watch the reaction.  For all we know there's a private detective monitoring their activities.  It could be completely innocent.  But the fact that they are choosing to photograph the door seems unusual."
offmychest,ff6omnc,t3_eru1na,1579631644.0,"I got to a certain age that I didn't give a rats ass what people thought of me and one person I've known for close to 30 years told me ""who put a quarter in you?""  I can deal with that."

RBI,ff5y4mu,t1_ff5977z,1579614035.0,Anyone working for organizationss such you describe  do not dress as if they are going to be doing yard work.  If there’s a chance they are going to be meeting an occupant there’s usually an official dress code for most organizations neither of these individuals have such outfits.  I understand business casual is the norm in a lot of situations but there’s a difference between business casual and dressing that far down.  The fact that these people were focusing on the type of lock installed and photographing said lock tells us a lot about the intentions of the people involved.

kraftwerk,ff4dzcw,t1_ff31pnu,1579561353.0,"The remastered original albums are the same instruments but ""The Mix"" ""Minimum-Maximum"" and the 3D box set all seem like new reconstructions of old material with modern equipment.  It sounds too good to be the older equipment/recordings.  When I saw the band twice the live sound was so good it was like listening to the best surround sound system I'd ever heard in a live performance over 30 years of concertgoing."
kraftwerk,ff2z9h3,t1_ff22dfx,1579529343.0,"Kraftwerk today use almost exclusively software virtual instruments so the ""analog"" versus ""digital"" argument is largely based on what types of sounds they wish to use.  They didn't really ""change during a piece"" but rather they employed for example mini moog style sounds during ""autobahn"" that sounds to me more like a VA type synth.  The average listener isn't going to detect this unless you're a sound programmer."

kraftwerk,ff0cyec,t1_fdvjpwm,1579467693.0,From my point of view it sounds like digital synthesizers trying to sound like analog synthesizers.   Subtle but there.

conspiracy,ff0bc15,t1_feym1f4,1579467174.0,"I think it is more likely they were witholding it so they could get some $ then release the items and probably ""forgot about it"" when nobody would pay."

Guitar,fezg8ru,t3_eqx3kg,1579457012.0,"My experience: tried a number of Chapmans that were probably made by World Music in Korea because they were all playable giggable guitars.  Some weighed more than you would expect but some of the wood they got made some of them seem like Norlin Era Gibson guitars.  You really have to try the guitars out in a store to see if they suit you.   The basic electronics and pickups were by design since Chapman had designed these for people to mod them.  He's getting a lot of flack lately via internet drama, I feel bad for the Riff City people but they didn't just sell Chapman guitars and part of their issues I personally think were related to location (outstate Minnesota in St. Joseph, a store in rural South Dakota and a store in the northern metro of the Twin Cities, I may have missed one).  However, the guitars were a major selling point when Riff City first appeared.  It's too bad things went the way they did since I liked Riff City as a business and the proprietor was a stand up guy.  Rob seems to be in a difficult situation of late - it will be interesting to see how it plays out."

However it was my first experience with the privately owned and run BBS scene and I later became a BBS sysop myself for 15 years. However before this I was on the Control Data PLATO system and it had interactive messaging similar to this. The Minnesota state Department of Education also had a main frame with online interactive messaging as well. However It was Ward and Randy’s system that made me think it was possible to run my own.
