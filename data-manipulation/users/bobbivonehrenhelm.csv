I felt crawling beneath my skin, an awful sense of dread, the only energy I had was nervous energy. Could only engage my self for a few seconds at a time, would have to jump up, go back to the couch, close my eyes and shake. Klonopin did nothing to relieve this, so I knew it wasn't anxiety. An increase in carbamazapine dosage and change of antidepressant finally stopped it. It was living hell."
