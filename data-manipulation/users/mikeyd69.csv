I replaced the trays in mine with the smoke/yellow Plano ones. I like them better for some odd reason."
Fishing_Gear,ffa8ok7,t1_ff9cpq1,1579730045.0,I'm a hardcore Daiwa guy but I will be honest....I would NEVER trade my Shimano Blackmoon backpack for the Daiwa one.
depression,ff8m7ot,t1_ff852w3,1579685442.0,Well here I am replying to you at 3:30 in the morning because I can't sleep more than a couple hours at a time....that sounds nice. Being able to leave everything behind and start over. I wish I had the ability to do that.
depression,ff8m4j9,t1_ff8kzfu,1579685308.0,I go to the gym 7 days a week. I weight lift a ton and I want to stay active...but fuck. Even while I am at the gym using music to try and drown out my thoughts it's not possible.
depression,ff80ywo,t3_es1ea3,1579663144.0,"This is me the last 5 years. EVERY FUCKING SECOND. I can't even have one fucking second of rest. It's literally my mind jumping around every single negative event in my life over and over and over. Then it goes to every terrible thing that could possibly happen tomorrow or the next day or the next. The only thing that has ever helped was getting blackout drunk. And that led to 2 trips to the mental hospital and a trip to rehab. I literally can't stop it. It's fucking terrible. Constantly distracting from everything I try and do. I can't sleep, I can't think, I can't focus, my life is in shambles.....Anyways thanks for listening, I'll be here all night. No need for applause."
Fishing_Gear,ff4rjtb,t1_ff4mqve,1579570725.0,Me too! I see them all the time and love the looks but have never actually purchased one.

Fishing_Gear,feyjsov,t1_feyf8y8,1579446460.0,I bought these at a retailer in NW Minnesota and I didn't see any SV reels when I was there. But the Tatulas I bought were at a crazy good price!
Fishing_Gear,fey6mig,t1_fewehsg,1579441405.0,Fuck yeah! I'm excited to be getting a new Tatula Elite pitch/flip reel soon!
Fishing_Gear,fey6dzk,t1_fewnblz,1579441347.0,Love all 3 but I have to admit the 100XS is my favorite. I love the aesthetics and it's simply an awesome budget high speed reel.
Fishing_Gear,fey5y4r,t1_fewniji,1579441269.0,"I have it on a 6' 10"" Shimano Zodias medium heavy. I use it for jerkbaits, walking baits, and it's my finesse set up for the moment. The higher speed of the reel really helps keep up with the rod movements."
BipolarSOs,few2i7z,t1_fesan4x,1579404571.0,Thanks for your reply man. It sucks. It's even harder trying to explain that you can't choose who you fall in love with. Like if I had a choice you think I would pick a girl with all these problems lol ?

BipolarSOs,fepa4cz,t3_eqaj2x,1579315558.0,"Holy shit it's like you can read my mind.....The mutual empathy, connection, excitement....It was all there for us too. Lasted about 4 months. Met her whole family, took pictures with her and her daughter, went to all the holidays, then out of nowhere she wanted nothing to do with me. Like 4 or 5 different times she said it was ""totally done"" and she ""couldn't take it anymore"". Then 20 minutes later she is telling me that if I can do certain things it will work out.

 She said anything is possible in the future but right now needs to be alone. I feel so fucking bad because I have my own mental issues telling me I did something wrong. 

It honestly led to me relapsing, going off my meds, and having a really bad suicidal depressive episode. Not the ""break up"" itself, but my feelings about myself because of it. Which is hard to explain to people.....It's not her it's me. This only happened about a week ago. Good luck to you on your struggles. Unfortunately for me love is overpowering the rational part of my brain."

depression,feng73y,t3_eq0coj,1579283997.0,I feel like as time goes on I will also get pushed further and further to it. Yesterday I took over 50 hydroxizine tablets at once not realizing it's basically fucking benadryl. So all it did was make me tired and dehydrated as fuck. Which obviously made me feel EVEN FUCKING WORSE. It's just not possible for some of us to have a normal life. Fucking sucks man.
depression,fenftu0,t3_eq0um9,1579283775.0,Everything I am passionate about costs money. It's bullshit. Especially when you look around at other people who get to do the things you want because they aren't fucked up in the head.
depression,fefmtjm,t3_eophbs,1579059739.0,Good luck with whatever you decide to do.
