asktransgender,ffpv8zj,t1_ffpj71p,1580107015.0,"I don’t even think salt will make this one work. Ask anyone who can say “my first puberty was female” and the answers will be wildly different. My mom at 23 before kids was an A cup. Me at 23 before ftm hrt, C cup. My mom now at 54? She’s DDs. Breast size changes with weight, age, hormonal changes (pregnancy, menopause, hrt doses perhaps? etc), exercise, etc. That’s just what we understand for those who went thru female puberty originally. I don’t think the understanding should be much different for those on hrt.

I say, don’t have any expectations. You’ll grow something to work with and if you don’t, like many women consider when puberty didn’t bless them, enhancements are an option."
relationship_advice,ffptltk,t1_ffpsd81,1580105231.0,"Glad you have an understanding of it! I’m not diagnosing her or anything but as a sufferer myself, when I get severely depressed, all my structure and habits goes out the window and when things finally start improving it takes week of consistency to re-establish all these habits again.

relationship_advice,ffps0fz,t1_ffppnop,1580103609.0,"The thing is, depression can often persist even if the situational side of things are improving. Depression changes the chemistry of the brain and though a situation can improve in a couple months, the brain’s chemistry does not change so eagerly or quickly, which is why many people need the help of medication. Depression isn’t just feeling down, it’s actually the brain being structurally changed.

 This kind of thing is a huge symptom of depression. It’s not an excuse to be a slob to the people around you, but understand its just really really hard to keep and make good habits with depression. I hate to admit it but depression was so bad for me at one point, even self-care like brushing my teeth was a habit I struggled to maintain.

She should see a therapist and a psychiatrist just for an evaluation at least. Maybe check vitamin D levels too considering the time of year it is in the northern hemisphere.

You don’t have to stick around but I do suggest maybe trying other things like cleaning together. “Can you help me pick up and do the dishes for just 5 minutes?” “Hey let’s gather the laundry up in the basket, it’ll only take 2 minutes tops!” “Hey let’s grab a slurpie and do some laundry real quick!” 

It might be more effective than criticism and getting fed up and just doing it all yourself ya’know?"

I’ve had to take him to court for his physical abuse and get protection orders. My father has COPD that’s only been getting worse and my brother fucking tried to choke him to death during one of his alcoholic rampages. Could have killed my mother that night too because he pushed her so hard she had a huge contusion on the base of her head.

HIV/AIDs has killed 32 million people since it crossed from Chimps to Humans inbthe 1920s (it apparently has done so at least twice, the second time came from a mangaby monkey, there are two different strains of HIV). The disease started in Africa, the first documented case was in 1959 in what is now DR Congo, where it is believed the disease first made a jump to our species. By 1980s the disease was world wide. 75 million have been effected with HIV-1 in just 100 years of jumping to our species.

Issues of his parents going out drinking for 12  hours at a time and being inaccessible to him. Times where he’s posted videos where he feels scared and like life isn’t going okay because of how his parents behave. 

His parents didn’t report him missing until 41 hours after he was last seen. I know it might not have made a difference if they reported him within 12 hours considering the nature of his death but how sad is it that an autistic (according to his mother) 14 year old goes missing and it takes the parents nearly 2 days to report his absence. The school called and notified his mother of his absence but instead she went out for drinks the two nights Harley was missing. Any normal mom wouldn’t be out drinking BEFORE reporting her son missing 41 hours after he was last seen. A normal mom would have been calling every person he knew to try to see if he was alright and where he was. Heck if it were my mom, no matter how old I was, 14 or 24, my mom would be driving everywhere and calling everyone looking for me if she hadn’t heard from me in a day and calling the police probably too soon.
