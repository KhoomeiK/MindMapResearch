GetMotivated,ff20xk4,t3_eqz4w1,1579490856.0,Indeed its easy to follow into to darkness and its a daily battle against that . I do have some fears and above all fears i dont want to be a negative person and i do try to avoid people like that i rather be a a dreamer i do know the evil on this world and the state of our planet and society but probably the most important thing is to respect the feelings of the person next to you and dont hurt them .
