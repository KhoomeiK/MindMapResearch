I support a number of podcasts voluntarily. I won’t support a multi multi millionaire who does not need the money. I see it as pure greed."
todayilearned,ffhh0f7,t1_ffgw6uo,1579934857.0,That or send another couple of harriers
JoeRogan,ffhgu0d,t1_fffucrh,1579934636.0,Jesus Christ it’s not even 7am and that last one got me belly laughing
JoeRogan,ffhgrnn,t1_ffg0tc8,1579934558.0,Take a bow sir you won this thread
JordanPeterson,ffhgkc3,t1_ffhbnsr,1579934312.0,Because think about the type of person likely to want to moderate such a sub Reddit. They aren’t exactly going to be the coolest kids in class. It’s more likely than not people who for the first time in their life have a tiny bit of power.
gifs,ffhg2a6,t1_ffhg0b7,1579933719.0,I’ve been thirsty since 13 with this particular woman.
AskReddit,ffgjo05,t1_ffgiwta,1579907775.0,More male homeless. Women live on average longer. 90% of workplace deaths are male. I mean I could go on exposing your ignorance if you want me to?
AskReddit,ffgjhrz,t1_ffgiyfw,1579907662.0,"Is it really an attempt if you’ve sent messages to 15 people just after taking some tablets?

Killing yourself is quite simple if you really want to do it. Don’t tell anyone, find a private spot and pick from the myriad of ways to do it. You’re comparing mostly cries for help with actual suicide.

Blowing your skull out isn’t a cry for help. Downing some tablets is."
ukpolitics,ffgcxe5,t1_ffgctij,1579903457.0,Seems like word salad to me
ukpolitics,ffgac1d,t1_ffga4jv,1579901873.0,"Your first sentence was the claim we now live in a post truth world. Feel free to delete that claim if you don’t wish to defend it.

I think the very notion of post truth is just the usual rose tinted view of the past. It was much much easier to hide things 30 years ago than it is today and we have countless examples of major lies people were fed at the time."
ukpolitics,ffg8q8m,t1_ffg8p8j,1579900883.0,Awful people
ukpolitics,ffg8ijp,t1_fffxqqg,1579900752.0,Thanks for pointing that out it makes me support it further. The SNP should be ignored.
ukpolitics,ffg6raj,t1_ffg00d1,1579899662.0,When was the period of truth that we are now post?
ukpolitics,ffg4ljj,t3_etfdru,1579898338.0,"“So here’s the government website. Please follow the basic instructions.”

Thanks Christ he is there for them"
TaylorSwift,ffg2n1d,t1_fffgctb,1579897130.0,"It’s not even necessarily about dirt it’s just about how controlled the access is that you give the filmmaker. 

I haven’t seen it yet so won’t comment too much until I do but this is very much what I expected. I guess given the awful way the media has treat her generally she is understandably defensive. 

All the promotion for Lover seemed way too corporate for me. Luckily the music is fantastic which ultimately is what matters."
ukpolitics,ffffmjg,t1_fffeq7k,1579882911.0,Bye loser
ukpolitics,ffff6ux,t1_ffff610,1579882643.0,Right now absolutely
ukpolitics,fffelfw,t1_fffeja7,1579882265.0,Losers often want to avoid getting into winning or losing hahaha
ukpolitics,fffed6l,t1_fffeaq1,1579882120.0,You’re calling a lot of people crabs then. No wonder your side keeps losing it’s hilarious.
ukpolitics,fffe7p1,t1_fffdqtr,1579882021.0,Love to read it. The longer the above attitude exists the longer the left stay out of power.
ukpolitics,fffe57o,t1_fffcqtw,1579881976.0,If they don’t exist why did so many northern seats go blue? Old people voted Tory before 2019 so there must have been some other change.
movies,fffbnof,t1_fffab9f,1579880406.0,"There are plenty of men who like fast cars, guns and explosions who do absolutely no harm to anybody else. 

There are plenty of loner losers who don’t have these hobbies who attack women. 

The idea that you can generalise about an entire culture is silly and Carlin I thought was better than that,"
movies,fff8t69,t1_fff8cvr,1579878563.0,Probably a massive part too. But either way it’s not just because men=bad as Carlin seems to be saying.
ukpolitics,fff6q9r,t1_fff4vs5,1579877117.0,If my credit score is anything to go by I’m on bother
LyingJoeyDiaz,fff2niv,t3_etak1c,1579874047.0,"He was on Rogan again recently and changed his age in a story 3 times in about 5 minutes.

He’s getting worse at lying."
ukpolitics,fff141r,t3_etadxz,1579872791.0,Really good news as the figures have been worrying prior to this
ukpolitics,ffezjih,t1_ffexnlo,1579871405.0,That’s a tiny sub section of the group we are talking about.
ukpolitics,ffess8n,t1_ffeslgu,1579863812.0,"That’s because middle class earners pay hasn’t risen, the poorest are better off. Taking general statistics when we are looking at a specific group is lying with statistics."
ukpolitics,ffepqyv,t1_ffeotq6,1579859313.0,Yea I’ve never quite understood this. Isn’t the point to not get hit at all?
ukpolitics,ffepg2s,t1_ffeo4yj,1579858858.0,It’s bizarre watching the so called progressives vehemently defend the status quo whilst The Conservative party is after radical change.
ukpolitics,ffepdzy,t1_ffeoshw,1579858771.0,"The consistent yearly above inflation increases along with the increase in personal allowance has actually made the poorest paid people better off since 2010.

But don’t let those facts get in the way."
gifs,ffehdnh,t1_ffe6w73,1579848073.0,"Hopefully it irritated him enough he wanted to use his millions to hire someone to stop him eating,"
movies,ffegztq,t1_ffd697s,1579847641.0,"I love Carlin but I don’t think the above audio is him spitting truth with no coating. It just seems to be a poor understanding of human evolution that led us to our present situation. 

The idea men just kill each other to stay useful is utterly dumb. Is it not more likely our ancestors protected their pregnant wives who couldn’t run away from attacks?"
JoeRogan,ffefqr6,t1_ffeepxp,1579846285.0,"Then what is the vehicle for change?

I think freedom means you’re not one car accident away from financial destruction. I’m not sure how that issue will be solved by private industry that have ignored it for decades."
todayilearned,ffdcdsh,t1_ffdccbh,1579817892.0,I’m just about to sleep. It’s been a fantastic day thanks!
todayilearned,ffdbz6k,t1_ffdbu2x,1579817631.0,"Thanks for the great chat.

Have a good one."
todayilearned,ffdba77,t1_ffdb8gu,1579817171.0,And why would you spend your time arguing with random angry racist losers?
todayilearned,ffdb5zl,t1_ffdb3i3,1579817092.0,"Yes they do.

This is easy. Just say the opposite with no reasoning."
ukpolitics,ffd0r2o,t3_esy729,1579811147.0,"Does he not even care how hypocritical he is?

This is fucking embarrassing"
ukpolitics,ffd0ms3,t3_esyjlv,1579811081.0,I wish this shocked me. But it’s exactly the attitude I’d expect from the middle class left wing gatekeepers.
