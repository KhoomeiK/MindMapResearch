DetroitRedWings,ffjjuq1,t1_ffjdojj,1579999868.0,"Tatar has 222 points in 407 games with the Red Wings this decade. Nyquist had 295 points in 481 games with the Wings this decade. Dylan Larkin had 238 points in 359 games this decade. Nyquist played 122 more games than Larkin and has 57 more points than Larkin does. I'd say that the main battle here is between Larkin and Nyquist, but Tatar still contends. If Larkin wouldn't make the first line, he'd definitely make the second line of the decade. Imo, the first line would be Datsyuk, Zetterberg, and Nyquist. The all decade team would need a center for the second line, in which I'd put Tatar, Larkin and Franzen. And, Nyquist has put up good points with the Wings throughout the decade and has played more for the Wings than Larkin has. But if there was only one line, I'd put Larkin a little bit over Nyquist."

Who’s the best player in the league? **McDavid, Draisaitl, MacKinnon, or Panarin**

Explanation: Mcdavid and Draisatl are great players, but they're together on their same line, they have the assistance of each other to rack up those points. MacKinnon has no fellow top scorers, and neither does Panarin. One of those four would be my pick

DetroitRedWings,fedbcic,t1_fed18dh,1579006514.0,"Jim Devellano said that it was because he wasn't in the hall of fame back in 97, but that seems like a bullshit answer. However, getting your number retired with the Wings seems to be incredibly difficult. Sawchuk, Lidstrom, Lindsay, Howe, Abel, Delvecchio, and Yzerman, all of these players are high renowned hall of famers, and also were captains of the Wings at one point. Larry Aurie was good and was Detroit's captain for a bit, but Detroit's standards are extremely high. He's not a hall of famer, nor is he highly renowned at all. I asked my dad, a die-hard Wings fan if he knew him, and he didn't. So when you consider that, you can see why Devellano said that. While I think we should be less strict with number retirement, I can still respect it and see why they have higher standards. It adds more honor to have your number retired and hung up."
