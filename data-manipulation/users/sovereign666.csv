This isn't a game to play with straight men. Everyone is entitled to their own sexual preferences, trans people included. Consent goes both ways.

I won't act like being a trans person and navigating the dating world is easy. It has its own difficulties. But that is the trans persons dilemma, not mine. I don't have to sleep with someone to validate their own sexuality. I think communication is better because it prevents the horrible stories we hear first, but also establishes communication which gives both parties agency. If a trans person is open from the start they won't waste their time with someone who is going to bail when said person finds out they've spent time with a someone that isn't sexually compatible with them.

The truth is that in a normal setting, men and women are self evident. Generally I can look at a woman or guy and know what's downstairs and I have the option to consent with the outcome when I pursue them. But when we start mix matching what's on the surface and what's in their pants, I am robbed of that insight. If a trans person wants to sleep with me and my comfort matters at all to them they will be honest with me. That affords me the chance to be honest with them. I'd be more open to sleeping with a trans person if I have the opportunity to decide for myself. Surprise me and I'm going home. Simple as that.

In my friends circle (late 20's) we abide by if its your bday, plan something. Some of us gift exchange but its not really expected...and no gifts should include expectations. But after several years if they don't give gifts back you need to decide if you are ok with not giving them gifts. If they don't expect them, and you dont want to feel like you are feeling, find it in yourself to skip the gift giving and just enjoy each others time. Me personally I hate receiving gifts, its awkward. So i openly welcome just seeing a movie or getting drinks with my friends. Some of your friends may feel the same way.

they suck for not just hiring a sitter and he sucks for his sexist comments. You suck for making it about you.

>it isn't my fault if our daughter feels closer to her stepfather

So as the child of divorced parents, with step siblings, I have been through 5 divorces (my parents, 3 more with my mom, another with my dad) and I have seen some major games, framing, parental alienation, and all sorts of shit. Regardless of how you and your ex feel about one another, that is his babygirl as much as she is your babygirl. I watched my mom withhold my dads access to my brother and I over the most petty things and for a long time all we had was every other friday, then eventually every other weekend. And you know what, thats not enough time. So I gotta ask, why does your ex not have a pure 50/50. If his home is a safe environment, why? Why does she not live with her dad for a week then come live with you for a week. Its not perfect, but its sure a lot better than her not knowing her dad very well. 

So my question. Did you fight tooth and nail to keep her from your ex? Ya he's mistaken for assuming you made her call your husband daddy and hes lashing out because of how much it hurts to hear his daughter call someone else dad in front of him. She his whole source of pride. But how many other wedges in his relationship with his daughter can be attributed to you?

My dads an asshole, he's been an asshole all my life. But he's my dad and I am so grateful that my mom wasnt able to squeeze him out of my life with court orders despite how much she disliked him for problems in THEIR relationship, not his and mine. I think its important to remember what matters here. Your daughter and her relationship with YOU and her relationship with HER father. Because he and her deserve that. I don't think it would be right to tell her who she can see as the father figure in her life. But I 100% believe her father should have equal access to his kid as you do because right now he doesnt even have the same amount of access to her that this other man does. 

The difficulty of raising a kid is compounded heavily by divorce and there is no shortage of empathy I have for both you and your ex. The conflicts with you and your ex at best wont end until she's 18."

What was communicated between the two of you. Did you bring up anything at all to him before, during, or after the party? Did you suffer in silence? Did he defend their behavior?

Beer pong tournament and housewarming party are two very different types of functions and I'm guessing he presented it to his coworkers as a strictly beer pong party. One involves a bunch of people getting shitfaced. The other is cheese and crackers over a tour of the house, often including bedrooms. So were they snooping? Were any rules or introductions presented to party goers at the beginning?  What was communicated to his coworkers? Was it the same communication the other guests received? 

These are his coworkers and he spends a lot of time with them. While they should respect you I think it is also prudent that you attempt to get to know them. Give them another shot, and communicate to them how you want to be communicated to back. That is, be transparent. You said the coworkers walked in without acknowledging you, did you acknowledge them? I've been the coworker at the house warming party that I was given no details about because the husband doesn't take it nearly as seriously as the wife. I've walked into a room not recognizing any faces because I was the coworker and was acknowledged by absolutely ZERO people.

She is too though and I completely empathize with your frustration. I work in healthcare and feel like a lot of nurses/MAs are just some of the most vapid individuals. Recognize that her inability to say your name correctly is a shortcoming on her part, not yours. Bring it up with your doctor, though now you have a lot less leverage."

But right now while you're in school its a good lure to give people a taste of your work, they will absolutely keep you in mind for future projects. It also continues to allow you to add to your portfolio. Good luck!"
AmItheAsshole,fc60dgx,t1_fc5zngk,1577469503.0,Absolutely. Full houses should be paid.

However, this is a common personal dilemma I and many of my friends have run into in our art hobbies that we take somewhat seriously. I've been involved in music and have a few friends in graphic design, photography, and beat making. A lot of us started doing these things out of love, but at some point the process or demand becomes time consuming and we wonder is there a number for what our time or work is worth? Some artists over charge and are ego fueled asshole, but the majority of us undervalue our efforts. One of my friends is really hitting strides with his film/photography career and he plateaued until he started taking it seriously and built packages of his work people can pay for and started doing wedding video. Before that he mostly worked with local bands and rappers doing a lot of free or homie hookup work. Right now you're asking for tips, and thats fine but stop advertising your work as 100% free. Eventually you will come at a cross roads. You will either level up and start charging for your work, or you will start resenting that people use you and you aren't paid enough, and thats territory where you become the asshole. 

Right now you're networking and developing your skills, but pretty soon you should look into turning this into a professional product, and thats why you should stop advertising yourself as being free."

But being a hypocrite...thats something her sister is sure guilty of."
AmItheAsshole,fc5xrej,t1_fc4bw1o,1577468105.0,Your sister is a fucking asshole.

I know I'm late to this party and there was a lot to unpack here. This conflict is not about the cats, thats been pointed out already and I completely agree. The cats is your fiances pretty shallow attempt at stonewalling you from moving in, my guess is to slow burn a breakup. I didn't get to see his comments as he deleted them but I saw the responses and I assume he believes that you dont clean up after the cats, you believe you do. I believe both parties here to an extent. I own two cats and I am more tolerable of my cats hair and smells than people I've lived with. To me cleaning the litterbox is every couple days. To others it should be like, every time they shit. Your boyfriend just sounds to me like he doesn't like cats. 

The issue I really have is that he engaged in a 6 year relationship with you and proposed knowing you and his living conditions are not compatible on HIS terms while at the same time living off of your parents for 2 fucking years. Why did he do this? To save money so that he could secure his own living space and then break up with you. He might not even be fully honest to himself with his own intentions but this is whats happening. 

The other concerning detail here which has been pointed out is that its his house, not yours and his. This is disrespectful considering it is the help of your parents and your codependency that enabled him to make this financial move. You're engaged and when you're married your financial decisions become a joint effort and it does not sound at all like he feels that way. Someone else said you need to find a partner, not a landlord that wants a tenant and sex and while thats a brutal take, I think its reflective of your situation. Kick him out, end the relationship. Your cats are your family and deserve to be with you and receive your love, and your partner will share that love as well. The fact that this disagreement has developed into an argument online shows there is a lot of work this relationship needs to go through to work. I think there is nothing wrong with going online seeking anonymous advice, people do it all the time and should. What concerns the fuck out of me is that he came on here to argue against you and people giving honest advice...that's a pretty poor reflection of his character and his intentions."

IdiotsInCars,fc5o12n,t1_fc5jw0n,1577462395.0,"Ya I agree with this. As technology advances, cars that were once supercars now...aren't? Like the new Corvette is being considered a supercar. In the 60s muscle cars were considered supercars in the US according to the wiki for supercars. 

In my comment you quoted what I meant was that the metric for supercar was performance. How much performance equates to a supercar is up for debate but other factors such as cost or being limited production went to exotics."
IdiotsInCars,fc5i6mn,t1_fc5hxzj,1577458279.0,Not all of them but there's a few. The 2020 Sian sure is.
IdiotsInCars,fc5hbuq,t1_fc5gzww,1577457600.0,"""This week, Nissan announced that the top-of-the-line 2017 GT-R NISMO will start at $174,990. 

With a price tag like that, the GT-R NISMO is firmly in supercar territory.  

For instance, the Audi R8 V10 Plus starts at around $190,000, the Acura NSX opens at $156,000, and the Porsche 911 Turbo S at $188,000."" - business insider

As wiki points out that it's using the term loosely we can get more specific. Gtr is a supercar while most lambos are probably hypercars."
