Outlander,ffan8ap,t3_esh9rg,1579739917.0,I don’t care for the violent sex/rape scenes but that’s because I don’t like that sort of shit. The regular sex scenes are nice though.

As for the electrolytes, add a shake of salt to your water, and maybe a tiny squish of like half a lime. You don’t taste anything and it totally helps."
