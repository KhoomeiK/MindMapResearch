lifehacks,ffo4aag,t3_eubthi,1580073988.0,Been doing this for years. In this shape you can put a pan on low and skip the thawing if you only want it crumbled.

howto,ffacitm,t1_ffa2itr,1579732319.0,"You could trace a wrench into a piece of plate and cut it out with the grinder.

Alternatively you could take a wrench that is the correct size and remove some of the material with the grinder till it fits that flat on your nut.

Even a wrench that's close and a bit too small would work well using this method."
howto,fezuoz3,t3_eqvvat,1579461895.0,"Try screwing them both back down to where they were and then turn them apart with wrenches. 

You may need a tight clearance wrench for the collar nut (on the bottom). If you don't have one you could try making yourself one with a piece of plate and a grinder."

CODZombies,fes8uyh,t1_fes05uw,1579362646.0,"It's an easy map with some wide open areas that make training uniquely easy on this map. Guard jug and flopper on 2player, the monkeys get very difficult to kill at high rounds. Eventually only the thunder fun kills then quickly enough.

They're are black hole grenades in this map, save them for emergencies.

You should have no problem doing rounds 50+"

LifeProTips,fedcxp7,t3_eokfpx,1579007959.0,I always do this. Keep a list of what you need and add to it during your trip. Stress free packing after that.

In the summer there's always festivals and events we can go out and enjoy. There are now 6 breweries here, we like to go enjoy craft beer. There are trails close by as well as throughout, many having waterfalls to see."
Hamilton,fdnspuz,t1_fdnp1xt,1578592067.0,"The people moving into Hamilton can afford to choose between the two. You're asking people that have made that decision if they feel the extra cost is worth it?

It all depends what is most important to you. Young people comming to Hamilton do it because of proximity to desirable work, culture and things to do."

modernwarfare,fdn7mmd,t1_fdn3469,1578579487.0,Say mlwhat you like about the multiplayer of IW. This game brought me back to love the zombies mode that I had lost all hope for. Somehow they produced the best in the franchise imo.
howardstern,fdl505x,t1_fdkzt7g,1578517142.0,"When Adam Sandler was in a little while ago he mentioned Shuli trying to shmooze with him and reciting his act to him basically. Trying to weasel into Sandler's circle rather than paying attention to Ronnie, like he was there for.

Shuli puts his own bag licking agenda before the show."
howardstern,fdk19gf,t3_elsxdw,1578493553.0,"Shuli is fantastic a weaseling his way into the studio at every turn. And once he runs out of relevant info he tries his best to be Artie.

Next time he's in studio, actually listen to him chiming in with nothing. 

75% repeating what Howard just said in his own words
15% bad jokes

Shuli is the professional bag licker in the office."
