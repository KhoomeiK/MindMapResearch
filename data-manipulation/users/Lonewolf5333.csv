lonely,feu327u,t1_fescget,1579382679.0,I’m tired of trying it sounds like a pity party but I’m more resigned to my fate. There isn’t any point of putting myself out there to just experience various forms of rejections

loneliness,fcqftf3,t3_eiazd9,1577885201.0,"I don’t say this as some kind of bullshit attempt to make you feel better. Rather what I’m about to say is because I don’t want to see anyone end up in the same boat as me.

You guys are young and still have almost your entire adulthood ahead of you. There’s ample time to meet someone and go on to live a happy fulfilling life.

I gave up early on and now I’m nearly 40 with a bleak outlook of either growing old, alone and bitter or putting myself out misery."

depression,fc551ph,t3_efyc5z,1577443538.0,"Rarely do I develop serious crushes because to me seeing someone attractive is like seeing a Lamborghini on the street. Yes I can acknowledge that it’s a beautiful car but on the flip side I realize that my chances of ever owning one is next to impossible. It just isn’t in my realm of possibilities that I person I’m deeply attracted to would feel the same way.

On the rare occasions that I meet someone that crosses that barrier for me it always ends badly for me. About a year ago I develop a friendship with a co-worker. That friendship eventually turned in full-fledged flirting. It got the point that we were talking nearly daily on a personal level phone calls texts. I started to develop deep feelings. It’s like walking in a rain shower everyday to all of sudden seeing the sun. Me being me this was short lived. My crush was transferred to a different department. Then I made the mistake of showing my hand sort of speak. I was open about my feelings. Things quickly began to deteriorate. 

Even though my crush didn’t want the same thing I thought at least the friendship would remain in-tack. But fast-forward to now; without any explanation or even a fight my crush no longer speaks to me at all. I think it’s most likely because they’re in a relationship. But regardless of the reasons this relationship was just another glaring example of why I will never ever be in a loving relationship. The minute I let anyone in they reject me and that’s just the way it will always be for me. 

This might be tolerable if I had friends but I don’t even have friends. I don’t matter to anyone except the few people that feel obligation to care because we share similar DNA."

depression,fbyi75i,t3_cml6ni,1577217518.0,Hopefully this is my last Christmas. No one gives a fuck about me except the few people that feel obligated because we share some DNA.
