drunkencookery,fddpr9u,t1_fdc9asu,1578320665.0,"Put water, apple cider vinegar, sugar, pinch of salt in a pot and heat on stove until hot (doesn't have to be boiling). While that's heating up, slice your red onion and put in a mason jar. Then pour mixture over it and let sit with no lid until it comes to room temp. Then cap and let sit in the fridge for 24 hours. Bam. Perfect pickled red onions. You can eat them before the 24 hours but I find they're better after letting them sit."

AmItheAsshole,fcvh19v,t1_fcvbj2a,1578001921.0,"Next time try making turkey salad (like chicken salad, but, ya know, with turkey). I chop it up and throw it in a bowl with Duke's mayo (aka the only real mayo that matters), a squirt of Dijon mustard, some sweet salad cubes (basically XL sweet relish), finely chopped red onion and celery, and some S&P. Throw that in the fridge for a couple of hours and enjoy by itself or on a sandwich. My favorite thing to make after Thanksgiving."
