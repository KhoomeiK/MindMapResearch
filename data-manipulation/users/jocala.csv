Seahawks,fec96zh,t3_eoctxg,1578968877.0,"Our season ended with the running back injuries. 
We needed someone to ram the ball in when were in the red zone. He could have gone on about his life with all this new business ventures and charities. And he chose to come back for the fans and the team. Wow. Didn’t ask for a crazy contract. I think that shows he’s mature enough to move on from mistakes in the past between him and the organization ( looking at you Earl and Sherman). He saw a bigger picture.
Every single fan for the Seattle Seahawks is lucky  as hell."
