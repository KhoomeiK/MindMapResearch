Honestly, as a man, I prefer to be told what to do/what you are thinking, because honestly (and believe it or not I am a fastidious person), I don't always see things as others would, because I am human. I'm not willfully ignorant, it's just that simply, people have different perspectives on things. 

In a relationship, the absence of communication is often the sign of an unhealthy one, or a sign that the relationship is on tenterhooks. I'm not suggesting that is your situation, but discussing things openly can save both of you a lot of frustration.

Over the course of three days I developed this pain in the lower left corner of my chest. I eventually had to drive myself to emergency after work, because the pain was unbearable and I couldn't breathe. Turns out it was two pulmonary embolisms - one in my right lung affecting 1/2 my lung function and the other in my left lung affecting 1/3 of the function. 

After meeting with one of the leading thrombosis specialists in the country I am on prescription meds for life because the cause was never determined. They are expensive and of course I still wonder what on Earth caused them. 

A deep vein thrombosis was discovered in my left leg, which is where the clot originated, but the ultimate cause is unknown. 

I was only 29 at the time, which is very rare to be getting DVT and PE's. Most people who get these are in their 60's or later.

TwoXChromosomes,feevl3w,t3_eorihe,1579042157.0,"Okay, I usually don't contribute to these discussions, because I am a man, but I have experienced both sides here. I think the problem many men have, myself included, is that we get easily attached to women who pay any attention to us. We aren't used to the attention, and so it is often misconstrued as flirting, even though this is not always the case (such as with you). 

There is also a social stigma for straight men hanging out with a woman platonically, and I would argue vice versa as well. Due to this internal strife of not being able to distinguish between friendly banter and flirting and the social stigma of hanging out with another straight girl in a platonic way, most men just abandon ship. 

I recently asked a girl out on a date, and she politely declined, that happens (she was way out of my league anyways) but she said to me that she wouldn't mind hanging out as friends. Sorry, but I've been through that before, and it is honestly not fair to either parties involved. I told her this and she was cool about it, but I recommend you do the same. Sexual tension develops easily for men, it's not a ""men are horny pigs and want to f#$@ everything"" deal, it's just easier for us to avoid temptation completely than the risk associated with flirting with it. 

Honestly, be yourself and keep being kind and fun to be around, but know that many men aren't used to that positive attention from women, and may take it the wrong way. The good news is that this happens all the time, so don't worry about hurting his feelings, he'll get over it."

I come from a science background and know a fair amount about sexual selection and can say that sexual dimorphic traits are without a doubt characteristics which attract the opposite sex in every species; it's why the dimorphism exists in the first place, otherwise natural selective measures would underexpress these traits, however that is not to say that these traits (breasts) would be eliminated altogether. 

There's a reason that women have breasts the way they do, just like there's a reason why men have a broader chest. They are hormonally correlated differences, and both are sexually desirable.

I believe you're only considering societies which live in hot or temperate climates, which of course it is cooler to not wear clothes than to wear them. If you consider societies (such as the Inuit), they aren't going to remain topless because they would freeze to death. So the clothing or lack thereof is predicated on the environment. This has little bearing on whether a part of the body is sexualized or not.

Traditional societies are still attracted to the female or male form, otherwise attraction would be based on personality or emotional attraction alone, which is frankly absurd. If you can't find beauty in the human form, than I suggest you never look at any ancient Greek statues or many Renaissance paintings.

The most famous is the Venus of Willendorf, as it is one of the first to be discovered. They have been found all over the world and clearly show that breasts are not a recent ""fetish"" nor a ""fetish"" attributed to any specific culture. 

The idea too that it is a fetish at all is just absurd. As a heterosexual person, if you weren't attracted to what is different physically in the opposite sex, than what would motivate the attraction? You could say personality or emotional connection, but that would mean that nothing about the persons physical appearance would warrant attraction, and in which case, you would have no problem having sexual relations with anyone, no matter what they looked like as long as they were of sound mind."

So, they are used for more than just breastfeeding. Society hasn't fetishized them, they've always been seen as a sign of fertility, and they also are one of the main distinguishing features between men and women. We have evolved to be sexually dimorphic and these differences are what build attraction between the sexes. 

This is like saying a man's testicles are just used to create and house the sperm and to be attracted to them is somehow a fetish.
