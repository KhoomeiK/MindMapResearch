Every time some outlandish scenario is used to threaten people it destroys the trust of more people in climate change claims.  Because real change will come with some pain.  Higher costs of goods, taxes on damaging actions, etc.  and people are going to oppose those things if the loudest advocates for stopping climate change are threatening a point of no return 5 years out with global economy collapsing demands to hit it, and then as time goes on the goalpost just keeps moving.

All I am asking for is a realistic prediction that the majority of the scientific community is willing to stand behind of what is most likely to happen, then we can make decisions on that.  

If the majority of the scientific community would speak before congress or the UN and say “we have come to the consensus that if we have not cut global CO2 emissions in half by the end of 2010 that this included map will show the sea level rise and what cities are now under water, and the global death toll and economic cost is this, I would be behind some extreme global laws regarding CO2 today!  I would crank my thermostat down and throw on a hoodie at home.  I would carpool to and from work or gather with my coworkers to give an ultimatum to allow working from home.  I would think long and hard before buying new clothes or other things I don’t really need, and i would support extreme taxes on things based on their CO2 impact.

Now if those same scientific majority stood in front of the UN and said: if we don’t reduce CO2 emissions by 10% in the next decade, we are going to lose 10 feet of coastline and some rich people and resorts are going to need to build some walls or build up the beaches if they want to preserve their beachfront property.

If you understand how to add up wattage, Just plug one power strip into the other if you are not exceeding the rated wattage (or amperage since voltage is stable).

But please do not attempt to splice two power strips together.  That is far less safe than just plugging one power strip into another.  

The reason power strips aren’t recommended to be plugged into one another is a combination of having higher losses with longer runs and combining extension cords or power strips make longer runs, and accidentally pulling too much power by plugging too many things in.  If you plug in multiple power strips you will have tons of outlets which some people will fill with all high wattage devices and then get mad when things fail.

After spending their first thousand they can’t stop playing now because they have already committed so much, so they keep getting in deeper and deeper.

I have seen many people insisting UBI needs to be around $30k per person. Some claims as high as $50k per person, and some as low as $1000 per month.  Also, do we adjust UBI based on where you live and the cost of living?  Or will this result in UBI restricting people to only being able to afford to live in certain low cost of living areas?

How much of this new UBI will the tax eat up?

If it is consumption based, the UBI funds will all be hit by this new tax.  What percent do you imagine this new, essentially sales tax, will be?

Maybe $20k would have been good for UBI, but now with the new tax to fund UBI, everything costs 10 or 15% more.   

If this amount is high it will also highly encourage cash transactions to dodge this new high tax.  People dodged sales tax online for years and many places still like dealing in cash.  The nail salon where my wife goes charges more if you don’t pay in cash, more than just credit or debit fees.  They know they can pocket cash but not credit card payments.

One big example is all the dishonesty that goes along with things like gun control. 

Someone wanting restrictions on guns will start off saying ""we need stop all these victims of gun violence.  There are people with assault weapons killing people all the time and it is getting out of hand.""  Now they are clearly framing the issue as people being gunned down by dangerous people with assault weapons.  Then they will say something like ""how can you not think that nearly 40,000 people being killed by guns every year isn't a big enough problem?""  Now someone who doesn't know much about the issue might be quickly swayed by how big that number is, but someone who has looked into this somewhat knows there is some trickery going on here, possibly intentionally, possibly unintentionally.  They could jump right in tearing down the claim, but it helps to give an idea of where the other person is coming from if you ask them to show where they got this number.  Then you can find out if the person realizes that over 20,000 of those were suicides and just trying slip those into the total count even though they don't apply, or if they are really ignorant and just knew the number.
