Boris has done so much self serving his entire life. He's closer to an Umbridge.

Even if there were any semblance of similarity between a HP protagonist and a Tory PM. JK Rowling would retcon that real quick.

I don't think a billionaire author in Scotland who put so much money into charity as to revoke her status, wants anything to do with a British Tory PM."
