Sometimes you win sometimes you don't. It was more about pushing the housing director as far as he would go."
JustBootThings,ff58l20,t1_ff4x6mn,1579583454.0,I'm OK with that.
perfectlycutscreams,ff56b3j,t1_ff45uxb,1579581460.0,"Sounds like you didn't have fun in college. We routinely did shit like that to our own houses. Our activities included but were not limited to: throwing knives at doors, ripping porch railings off, indoor baseball where the bat was a frying pan and the ball was empty beer bottles, tic tac toe but it was throwing fruit through window panes."
offbeat,fexcmvy,t1_fes1osm,1579428711.0,"Fun story, in VA there isn't a way to register your guns. I inherited a rifle and shotgun. My wife wanted me to be sure they were in a state database incase they were stolen: no database."
tumblr,fet9m4a,t1_fet2aa0,1579373018.0,There is a relationship between how much a person reads and how well they write. It also has to do with the type of things you're reading (and trying to write) and how much attention you're paying to craft. There's also that a fair amount of being good at writing is research and a willingness to heavily edit.
tumblr,fes768t,t1_fer5pwo,1579362107.0,"Also, the symbol isn't the goal. The symbol is a small piece of a structure you have to analyze that also has to work within the larger work and your system of analysis."
tumblr,fes6bsw,t1_feri256,1579361895.0,"I've been on the other side of the desk. Prompts are mostly just for students who need them. The real goal is to write. If you wrote something that some creativity and structure then goal accomplished.

Also most people are bad writers. Most teenagers are exceptionally bad writers. Of course it read like bad fanfic. Being decent at writing requires a lot of time and effort."

carporn,fdukfnd,t3_en25ao,1578734306.0,Unpopular opinion: notch backs look better. But my father had a notch back when I was a teenager so I'm working with nostalgia.
toastme,fdrypbk,t1_fdqirqe,1578691748.0,To teach an accredited course you must have at least 18h of a masters completed. The rules are a little different for professional programs. Odds are you won't get a full time position teaching anywhere without a PhD.
toastme,fdqnbmp,t3_emplta,1578670713.0,Except you have to have at least half of your masters complete  to teach in higher education.
worldnews,fdiwd31,t1_fdiw73t,1578452533.0,Please look up the millennium wargame before saying they can't beat us.
worldnews,fdit89q,t1_fdipt1z,1578450513.0,"In warfare you attack military targets, not civilians. The US assassinated an Iranian top official. Iran has responded with a salvo on military bases, twice proving they can attack by surprise and when we are on high alert. This is a very serious 'no really, you aren't going to be able to walk over us like you did Iraq.'"
personalfinance,fdglna3,t1_fdg13vi,1578401480.0,Yes. That's why I said based on my current numbers. I know what interest is.
personalfinance,fdfz892,t1_fdfyfdp,1578374442.0,"What you say is true. The income based repayment plans there are 2 or three of them are on the 25y timer (apparently 20 if they are from after July 14), are forgiven as taxable income. So thats 18-40%. If we use the low percentage and my current loan debt that would be.... $23000."
personalfinance,fd57eev,t1_fd412pg,1578174942.0,It's definitely felp but some I believe most Stafford as well. All of mine qualified and they go back to like... 2005.
MaliciousCompliance,fd3dvcu,t1_fd2o1zf,1578157346.0,"I am too, but it's a reason, not an excuse. Clear and effective communication is a basic expectation anywhere you go. Having a language based disability means that you can't just bang some writing out and hit enter."
personalfinance,fd39xcm,t1_fd2mque,1578156175.0,"It's not its 20-25. Depending on whether the loan was disbursed after or before July 2015. So I was a little off. After that the remaining debt is cleared and it counts as a gift. Monetary gifts are taxed. So if you have a lot of student debt, and end up under employed, it's a good setup."
personalfinance,fd387wj,t1_fd2kljz,1578155696.0,If you're on income based repayment your payment can be $0 if your income is low enough. So if you lose the employment lottery or life otherwise screws you it's an option. I didn't say it was a good plan. But it's not moving to another country to escape your student loans.
personalfinance,fd2aklo,t1_fd22p7f,1578144313.0,"Yes, but after 30y they're erased as a gift and you go bankrupt because of your tax bill."
Discussion,fd25gdq,t1_fd22ulr,1578141970.0,"Globalization makes a world war much less likely. Widespread multinational warfare means international shipping is going to shut down and planes and cargo ships will be sunk. The cables that make the internet happen would likely be cut. Commercial and industrial production relies heavily on those shipping lanes. Speaking to a US/China conflict, we need each other economically too much.

For Iran its a similar set of issues we are just less economically tied. Iran isn't undeveloped in the way that Iraq is/was. They have a significant military and they have strategic allies. A ground conflict with Iran may not expand into a multi front international conflict but would certainly involve proxy support.

And even if Iran wouldn't be a conventional war, the conflicts we have been involved with since Vietnam have proven that the US doesn't exactly fare well against insurgencies."
Discussion,fd235ph,t1_fd1p4ly,1578140973.0,"The concern is because, like the start of ww1, Iran has strategic allies. If a ground war were to start those allies could become involved. Assassinating a cabinet level official of a country we aren't at war with is a big deal. Iran is much more developed than you're giving them credit for. In the war game that simulated them as an enemy we lost pretty handily. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Challenge_2002"

PublicFreakout,fcj3mlv,t1_fciyizg,1577676439.0,"I'm not saying no one should use descriptive dictionaries. I just find prescriptive to be more useful. I'd rather know the development and history of the word rather than common usage. Case in point is that considering officers of the law not civilian adds ambiguity to labeling police, it's a military police or... Police police but they're not civilian police because they're not civilians.

My work is mostly in writing and editing so I think more about words than most. It's an occupational hazard more than being hip."
PublicFreakout,fciotn7,t1_fcig7j9,1577666327.0,"As I've said elsewhere, I don't rely on descriptive dictionaries since they reflect popular usages. Prescriptive or etymological dictionaries care about what a words history and specific meaning is."

PublicFreakout,fcf0c2b,t1_fcei1qq,1577625402.0,Police are civilians.
ThatLookedExpensive,fc174fj,t1_fc16g5y,1577310160.0,I know plenty of people who have no interest in them or their work. They also lost their starwars contract because of the backlash.
