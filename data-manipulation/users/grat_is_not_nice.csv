Complex carbon chemistry was historically associated with plant and animal life - and thus was *organic*, as opposed to chemistry that was associated with rocks and ores and salts and metals - *inorganic* chemistry.  
  
There is also a difference in the way *organic* chemical bonds form - they are **covalent** bonds, where atoms share outer electrons to complete the outer shell in accordance with the number specified by quantum mechanics. Carbon has 4 electrons in it's outer electronic shell, but that shell requires 8 electrons to be in it's lowest energy state. So one carbon atom can have four bonds to four other carbon atoms, or hydrogen atoms, or chlorine atoms, or a mixture of those. It can also form double or triple bonds to other carbon atoms which are still stable and affect molecular structure in different ways.   
  
Inorganic chemistry is based on electrons being exchanged to form charged *ions* that balance out the positive and negative charges."

AskReddit,fchntrf,t1_fch5tw8,1577652185.0,"It's just a bacterial skin infection, but made worse by additional risk factors - things like a compromised immune system, morbid obesity, alcoholism, and probably exacerbated by *Peripheral Neuropathy* and/or *Peripheral Vascular Disease* (both complications of poorly managed diabetes).  
  
If you can't feel small injuries/infections (due to peripheral neuropathy), and blood-flow to the region isn't good (due to peripheral vascular disease), anerobic (not needing oxygen) infections can take hold and spread, and immune cells cannot get to the site to fight the infection. It's depressingly common for diabetics, and results in amputations (toes, feet, lower limbs) all the time."

Use ""-i 0.0:nnnp"" with a filter to capture packets from tmm, and see both the client-side and server-side flows, at a much higher packet rate."
interestingasfuck,fbv5vnb,t1_fbu5gug,1577126006.0,"This was a plot point by *Doc E. E. Smith* in the **Lensmen** series of books. They had an inertia-less drive system which allowed (super)-relativistic speeds without relativistic effects. But once the drive was turned off, you instantly had the momentum vector you had when it was turned on, in some absolute frame of reference.  
  
Two ships meeting in space from different planets would have to spend many hours *matching vectors* while they neutralized their respective momentum."
