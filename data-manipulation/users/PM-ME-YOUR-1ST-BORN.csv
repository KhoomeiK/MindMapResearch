asmr,ffahu65,t1_ff9ll1o,1579736081.0,"Damn really? I suppose it’s all subjective, I personally wouldn’t call them old school, but that’s because I’ve been following ASMR for a long ass time lol, since before it was even called “asmr” and it was just a vague “whisper community,” so I was ‘around’ for the beginning and rise of both of their channels.  
  
If you want my opinion, I’d consider old school to be like... whisper crystal, whisperinginblue, the whispering voice, gentle whispering (though she has evolved with the times lol), kiwi whispers, danish vlog, soothing whisper, etc... I could go on and on lmao."

They’re basically little sponges, they’re absorbing everything around them, The conversations you have around them, they are listening and understanding.  
  
I’ve had so many parents just start talking to me about their kids lives/school issues while they’re right next to them, probably thinking they don’t “get” what we’re saying or are too young enough to remember. That is *not* the case."

PublicFreakout,fe0e1hg,t1_fdzfyxh,1578811443.0,"Agreed, but also, the lady who got bit was being a huge asshole and started a physical altercation with the owner and shoved the dog off the seat.  
  
Let me be clear: the owner is garbage. Absolutely. He brought an aggressive dog onto public transport, he's an asshole. But the lady would have walked away completely unscathed had she not decided to try and physically start something with a fucking pit bull. You wanna SHOVE a violent animal because you're mad at the owner? You're gonna get bit.  
  
The owner is an asshole, this lady is a moron. Everyone is stupid here."

But nope. This comic shows the reality. When I'm gone, they BOTH sleep. When I'm there, they each come bring me a toy and stare me down until I play with both of them, simultaneously. If I stop, they don't continue playing with each other, they just stare at me like ""oh, we're done?"" Dorks."

PrequelMemes,fcbutdf,t1_fcbqtxp,1577591218.0,"MY logic is flawed?! LMAO. This is a joke, right?   
  
My logic: this is a star wars sub for people who want to have fun talking about movies they like that were received negatively, so it sucks when they constantly shit on star wars fans for liking other star wars movies movies that were received negatively.  
  
YOUR logic: the prequel fans hate the sequels, so if a sequel fan comes here and gets death threats, oh well, that's their own fault.  
  
That is some victim blaming, completely devoid of logic bullshit. Prequel fans must surely hate the sequels? Talk about a wide, sweeping, massively over generalized blanket statement. That's not even true. YOU are part of the problem of this fandom becoming SO polarized, in thinking that being a sequel hater just automatically comes with prequel fan territory, and, oh well, that's just how things *are.*  
  
And even if that WERE true - how does that justify the mass downvoting, the vitriolic arguments, and the death threats? How does that justify me being told that I must surely be mentally disabled because I liked TLJ, and that because I'm ""mentally disabled,"" I should be purged from the earth? How does that justify the person who said, completely seriously, TLJ was on par with war crimes? Or the time someone told me if I kept shtiting on AOTC for being cringey, they'd send me dick pics (aka sexual assault)?  I've commented completely chill things like ""tlj had some pretty cool cinematography"" and been downvoted to -17 with one reply that was a simple ""fuck you."" These are just *a few* things I thought of off the top of my head - and I'm sure many other TLJ fans who engage with the community here have similar stories and experiences.  
  
I hae no idea what point you're trying to make here dude. ALL I said was that it sucks that a bunch of Star Wars fans can be so hateful and terrible and mean to OTHER Star Wars fans, especially when you'd expect them (as prequel lovers) to be a little more sympathetic. You can hate the sequels, I don't give a singular fuck, but the people in this subreddit get VERY intense about it, in a very negative way. It's sad, it's disheartening. That it is. That is ALL I'm trying to say. IDFK what your problem is, or why you'd try to argue against that point, or what point you're even trying to make, but I honestly don't care anymore. Have a good night."
