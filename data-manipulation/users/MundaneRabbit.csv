AskReddit,ff6pvt7,t3_eqt3lg,1579632397.0,I think remotes and VCRs. Hell. I can't blame them on that. I still have problems with remotes for some reason. Something about the abstract and sometimes delayed nature of the interaction with the interface to expected result fucks with me.
AskReddit,ff6p4op,t1_fezet6b,1579631948.0,"This makes me think of my grandmother. She's in her late 90's  and never had a computer, tablet, or even cell phone. She had her radio and a small tube TV and a land line till her health became so bad she had to be placed in a home. Hell, she didn't even want an answering machine till she was in her 80s. Currently she's so frail she can't get out of bed and has general dementia and severe memory / retention issues. The last time I visited her (quite a trip for me since she's half way around the world) I had taken photos of a bunch of places around our families home town. The village square, churches, parks, old buildings etc. 

It was more for myself but during my visit at her bedside, struggling for something to connect with her on I pulled out my touchscreen phone and started showing the photos to her. She immediately connected to it. She lifted her hand up and with paper thin fingers started swiping and zooming on the screen and started talking about the places she was seeing. It was fascinating to watch her and this spark just come alive."

fatlogic,fde3tbe,t1_fddvyl1,1578330558.0,"Pretty much. I was at 220lb since like fucking High School. For years. It becomes *really easy* to interpret that as ""hey, it's my bodies natural set point!"" ... That's why Fat Logic is so insidious. No, it's not ""natural"" it's all my shitty habits balancing out with *some* of the healthier ones, I've always enjoyed walking and thankfully never developed a soda/cookie/junk food/fast food problem. I just don't buy it because I know I'd eat it all.

But big portions, eating whenever and whatever, and not watching calories in meals, tricking my brain into thinking because I cooked it fresh then it wasn't ""unhealthy"" (lasagna, sandwiches, meatballs, creamy egg dishes oh my!) and being generally mostly sedentary got me to and kept me at 220. When I started watching ingredients AND calories and being much more active my weight ""*magically""* dropped.

But I didn't incorporate those changes into a permanent life style and \*boom\* back to about 210 now.

AlAnon,fde3e9u,t3_ekhh4h,1578330293.0,"I'm so sorry you are going through this. It sounds like you are carrying many burdens. I know this is tough to hear but you need to know when to hand a burden off to others. Are there others in the family who can help care for these family members, especially on his side? Please try and reestablish contact and connections to your own support system. You need to take care of yourself first to take care of anyone else."
fatlogic,fde2u09,t1_fddwxhm,1578329926.0,"Exactly. It's super fucking easy to be ""healthy"" and fat into your twenties (barring genetic, autoimmune, environmental factors or catastrophic accident or something else out of your hands) but it's a much quicker downhill slide into shitty quality of life after that. Blood work, joints, strain, etc - I know at this point having watched my own family and now myself. Trying fucking hard this year to do the right things."
fatlogic,fcv33yt,t1_fcti9wx,1577993654.0,"This so much. My ""diet"" worked. It was easy to lose 50 pounds. But I didn't change my lifestyle, my mental state, which in my case was greatly impacted by not dealing with my mental health stuff, including stress and underlying ways of dealing with boredom and depression. Diets and CICO is fucking easy. It's lifestyle that's hard and it's critical to address \*that\* part of health. And in my case, I gained back all the weight.

It's like HAES  think that people struggling with mental health issues must keep their fat bodies intact and that's the only measure of ""good"" health they can understand. If a fat body stays fat then the person is healthy but if they try and address mental health issues and along with that their body changes, then they are no longer being healthy or working on their personal health but ""under the thumb of diet culture."""
AlAnon,fct3ljy,t3_eilxob,1577931992.0,"My partner and I did once a week couples therapy to work through many of the topics such as trust, triggers, paranoia, and general resentment. I also do my own therapist sessions, my partner does group at their treatment center) and we both attend our own meetings seperatly (AA, Agnostics and Meditation for them, Alanon, SMART and Meditation for me)

We started couples therapy right after my partner had completed 4 months at a treatment center. My partner has been sober now for almost 10 months with no relapses and we still do twice a month couples counseling and will likely continue for at least the first half of the new year.

I'm not sure about reading material for couples recovery but there's a book called ""Girlfriend of Bill"" that apparently some people say gives a good idea and advice on being in a relationship with someone in recovery. I haven't read it but found some good reviews when I was looking for my own relationship reading.

For my situation I found that the SMART Workbooks actually helped my partner and I with communication techniques and emotional and situational awareness. Full of practical examples and exercises we could put into place. Both of us already had issues communicating our needs, wants, and concerns and the alcoholism really fucked that up, so it's been amazing to be able to express ourselves in positive constructive ways these past few months.

I wish for the best for you and your love."

ChoosingBeggars,fc2rvxt,t1_fc2kwxp,1577372228.0,"Didn't think of that. She's a teenage girl so social messaging etc is something she'd think was life ending critical. Plus, not being able to hook into a specific social environment being used by the cool kids in her social circle could tell everyone else that she's ""poor"". 

I think mom needs to better understand what's motivating her daughters behavior.

ChoosingBeggars,fc2qyn5,t3_efrrm3,1577371432.0,"I'd definitively take this opportunity to call her bluff as well. What software? There's only a few applications limited to running on Macs and all of them tend to be professional or design software. So hey, if she's interested in a career in one of those fields maybe y'all could work together to figure out how, there's scholarships and grants she could apply for, maybe she's interested in an internship, has she looked into alternative software with free pricing for students to learn the skills etc etc. If she's legit then it's a great opportunity to open up an encouraging conversation about the future and plans - at an age they usually shut down.

Of course, I suspect she's BSing you and just wanted a status book.

/edit someone else mentioned it could be the social messaging apps limited to Apple products. For a teenage girl who's classmates/friends (or peers who she wants to impress/be closer to) use that specific environment it would be important. Not being able to participate in all that would be ostracizing and signal her out as being ""poor"" (that's the world we live in). Either way, mom needs to find out the motivation behind the behavior as maybe she can better understand where her daughter is at. Doesn't excuse the kids ungrateful behavior but communication needs to happen. Plus a cheap / older iPad could satisfy those needs if mom still wants to be generous after the display of teenager ""sensitivity."""

AlAnon,fc2qb3k,t1_fc2nbax,1577370854.0,"/nothing to do with alcoholism but tip on the cat.

Might have to get its  teeth pulled. I have an older cat that even brushing and dental treats didn't prevent teeth issues. He's on soft foods now. :( 

The skinniness could also have to do with hypothyroidism. Apparently a lot of older gets get it. My cat suddenly started losing weight and grew ravenous despite feeding him the same and him being quite sedentary indoors. Took him to the vet, ran some blood work and confirmed. Now he's on meds (the meds are quite cheap) and he's doing fine. The alternative was radiation therapy and I don't have the money for that. As long as the cat eats his pill pockets twice a day he'll be fine. 

Good luck with the old fluff!"

fatlogic,fc2pep6,t3_eflq5l,1577370036.0,"At what point in our bizzaro timeline did the word 'health' or ""healthier"" become a ""moral statement""? It's like saying ""Faster"" is a moral statement. You can be faster then a toddler crawling, Bolt, grandpa walking with his cane, or an F1 car. The definition is contextual, not moral. Same with 'healthier'. You can be healthier overall compared to someone, or have a healthier heart, or lung capacity, or life expectancy, or ""feel"" healthier then someone undergoing chemo. None of it is ""moral."" 

I know there are some who see health \*as\* moral though. Where it gets fuzzy. Like if you don't eat a vegan diet because they see it as healthier for the planet then you fail, morally. For example. Or if you feed your kids a cupcake at a show instead of healthier kale salad. You fail as a parent. But, overall it's \*them\* attributing morality to the situation. You don't have to accept their gift of words or world view.

A good tip for figuring out if someone has a social / belief agenda they are pushing: Do they attribute morality to neutral words of description or action?"
fatlogic,fc0cqrv,t1_fbzi86v,1577287095.0,"God damn this. All this. And food is one that is \*really\* difficult because you literally do have to eat to live. There are so many unhealthy and terribly damaging ways people turn to food when dealing with stress, mental illness, depression, anxiety, isolation, scarcity in other areas (time, resources, money.) Oftentimes these relationships to food go completely unacknowledged, unexamined or not dealt with properly. Acknowledging all that complexity would be a first step to people getting help for the things they often desperately want to get help with. If a fat activist wants to be fat? Sure. Fine. More power to them. Enjoy. But don't dare deny others their agency to deal with all that shit, their health or shame them into wanting to get help for countless underlying issues that impact their relationship with food."
