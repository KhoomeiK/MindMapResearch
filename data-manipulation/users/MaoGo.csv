I did not intend to criticize these channels of information, there is actually a lot of history channels and podcast that have much better quality that some of the actual history text books. For introducing yourself into a new subject, podcasts and YouTube are amazingly great. The problem is that there is also a lot of crap out there and some people think that they know everything about a subject because somebody summarize the important bits in 10 min or less. (Contrary to the other sciences and social sciences, history is more broadly popularized and it is easier to deform it just to prove a point)"

The government also started only supporting universities that agreed with the Bolivarian ideology (mostly recently funded universities) so the already existing ones started to lose support and resources. Now most public universities are struggling without food, water, electricity and transport. Many good people are still working there but the situation is difficult, quality has to be affected.
