fasting,fesl9x1,t1_fes8fmw,1579366407.0,"If the question to be answered is ""How many calories does Michale Phelps burn when he's swimming 100 yards at 2 mph, then yeah, the calories burned would be similar, or likely less than your average Joe.

However, if you ask how many calories I burn when swimming at Phelps's world record speed, that's a N/A because I'm unable to achieve that.  Phelps is, quite literally, able to expend more energy faster while swimming than other people. This is what a race is. Whoever can expend the energy necessary to move your body across the finish line fastest wins.

Since we don't know what Phelps's training regimen is (how fast or how far for example), we can't say whether it would be accurately estimated by the calorie burn estimate for a normal person.

For instance the hourly ""fast swimming"" burn per the source let's say factors in swimming a half mile in that hour. What is Phelps swims faster than the baseline and instead swims one mile or a mile and a half?

Since we don't know if, and to what extent this happens, it's unwise to presume he's going to fit into the metric for a normal human."

fasting,fepofsz,t1_fepnivo,1579326054.0,"Well Michael Phelps is unusually good at swimming. He's stronger, faster, and more muscular than a normal human.

careerchange,fepo3eh,t3_eqc3xl,1579325760.0,"Everyone goes through tough times. Once you are able to move on, you will be stronger for having experienced times when things don't go according to plan. Often times, we have a perfect picture of how we expect our careers to go, but things rarely go perfectly. Life is about adapting when things don't go as expected.

First thing, I think it's important to be willing to do what it takes to be financially secure in the short term. If you're into Python and AI, that's great, but you'll likely need to take a job in the meantime to support yourself. I'm not familiar with your industry, but if there are any prospects that combine your past experiences with an opportunity to gain new skills in the areas you're interested in, that's an ideal way to transition. 

Also, there's no shame taking a job through your father. If it's not in an area that you're interested in, just use it as a stepping stone while you're pursuing your goal.

My primary points would be: take some time and really ask yourself what you would enjoy doing and work towards that. Don't get discouraged that you haven't found the perfect job yet - that's a lifelong quest for most people. Do what it takes to make ends meet while you're pursuing your dreams."

It's more like support for a football team or a religion than a typical politician's support. Any negative or neutral statement about Bernie is seen as a personal attack that must be responded to with a counterattack. 

It does make the susceptible to bots, since many people think that members of the tribe (that are actually just bots) are actually reacting in a certain way (claiming that they won't vote for Hilary, or personal attacks on Warren), and it gives them permission to act the same way.
