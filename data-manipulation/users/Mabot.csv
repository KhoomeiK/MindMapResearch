todayilearned,fei1chj,t1_fegylo1,1579128140.0,"Yeah. I guess technically each countries red cross is its own organization with its own way of operating.
Here there are corporate plasma companies, that pay a bit more and allow more frequent donations, which really feels much more for profit, but even there, there are lots of students and just fit people and then there is the red cross which pays a bit less and doesn't let you donate quite as much and the people there are very normal people. All the (few) advertisements for donating blood or plasma are also always phrased very heroically. With phrases like ""Already saved a life today?"" and never about money. I saw some people surprised when the staff brought up payment. 
Also both private and red cross donation centers have a doctor to examine your health quiet intensively. 

I once watched a documentary about how a substantial amount of the world's plasma comes from the US because is such a business there with loose checks and regulations. They showed a lot of poor cities with a lot of jobless people that nearly only live from donating plasma. And a lot of people paying for their addictions with it. Looked very dystopian."
todayilearned,fei08nd,t1_fehj5jb,1579127473.0,So you are saying you give AB+ patients A+ because of lack of AB+ blood and the missing B antigenes aren't that bad?
todayilearned,fegyav8,t1_fegsvd6,1579105228.0,Might be different in my non US country. I give plasma directly with the red cross
todayilearned,fegsfb3,t1_fegrcf4,1579101460.0,"Yeah Plasma is correct. I once asked what they exactly do with my AB+ blood and they straight up told me they just extract the plasma and throw the rest away. 

Since then I am only giving plasma. And that even earns some money, where whole blood doesn't earn anything."

The battery has two foils contacting and having 3.7V nominal between them. But the capacity **and** the current rating depend on the areas of those touching foils."
