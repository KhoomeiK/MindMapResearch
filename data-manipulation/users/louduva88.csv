depression,fdbwvoh,t3_ekby0j,1578263148.0,I'm so sorry. I just put a sweater on my cat for the first time (he's completely white and fluffy but he's small under all the fluff) and now he thinks he can't walk. He takes a step and then falls sideways because he's under the impression his legs have stopped working. Picture a derpy cat in a skeleton sweater rolling around on the ground with his legs sticking straight out. Is it helping?
depression,fc9ql6r,t3_egqg5d,1577556710.0,"...I kinda like hearing about ppl overcoming obstacles to do something with themselves. Even if it's just overcoming their depression long enough to get up and shower. It sucks to look st how much I suck by comparison, but I genuinely like to see others succeed. Unless I happen to know they're awful ppl. Those folks can shove it."
suggestmeabook,fc10xr2,t1_fc0xenm,1577305112.0,I've read this book 6 times. Every time it's over I get that malaise washing over me. I set the book down and need a quiet moment to gather my thoughts.
