Basically all of Charli XCX and Carlie Rae Jepson's songs. Also Do Me by Kim Petras. It's going to be a weird night going to see Charli then Rage in a matter of hours.

Edit* All of 100 gecs songs too. I went from thinking ""what the fuck is this noise?"" to it really clicking for some reason. I don't know that it's actually good, or sometimes even music, but it's different and I can't help but like it. I also want to go around calling everybody piss babies and small trucks."
Coachella,fgrpeyx,t1_fgrjk7k,1581053188.0,Agreed. It was a very Miami half-time show and I loved how focused it was on their asses for a family friendly event with how bad people lost their shit over Janet's nipple for a half second. But I'm not going to be excited about either of them on the Coachella lineup.

Coachella,fgoms2d,t1_fgoldkn,1580976344.0,"You might be able to sell it in the buy/sell/trade thread here and get face value for a w2 ticket. I've been keeping an eye on stubhub for a while and w2 has been consistently under $500 before fees. The problem with selling it at that price point is after stubhub takes their cut you're taking a loss. I think it's in the $535-$550 range that you cover the original cost of the ticket after fees and they aren't coming close to that, even for w1."

Coachella,fgntc6g,t1_fgn8vtg,1580952462.0,"Definitely do not recommend Anza. I'm out there for work semi-regularly (today and tomorrow in fact), and that road will be really dangerous after a day of festival activities even sober. There are wrecks on that road regularly even in the day. I had a co-worker get into a wreck because there was an accident around a blind corner with traffic completely stopped ahead of him on the other side. There's also a lot of wildlife that roams around the road at night even if there aren't a lot of cars.

Banning is also not a good idea with how far it is but it's better than Anza. Staying in Banning if you wait until the headliners are done you're pushing somewhere between 3:00 and 4:30am depending on how long it takes to get out of the immediate area of the festival and onto the highway.

I've had a friend stay in Banning once but he did weekend 1 camping, then was going in no earlier than 4:30pm weekend 2 and also left early a couple of the nights since he had seen what he wanted to w1. Outside of a situation like that where you know you're not going to want to get in earlier than 4:30 and potentially leave early (he's also got over 10 years Coachella experience) it's a really bad idea to stay so far out. It's dark and really easy to fall asleep at the wheel on the highway. I mentioned it in another post that was similar to yours, but I take the shuttle to Albertsons then cross the street to get to my hotel. Just that is hard enough on me, I couldn't imagine sitting in a car for an hour or more to get out of parking and onto the highway then having another hour drive to the hotel. I know 100% I couldn't do it, even sober.

If you can't afford accommodations in the greater Palm Springs area it's much safer, and cheaper to camp. I stay in a hotel every year, so I definitely understand not wanting to camp but there's a reason Palm Springs is pretty much the outer limit of where people stay. If Banning were an easy/good option those hotels would be booked and more expensive too."

Coachella,fgl44oj,t1_fgl2yfl,1580881410.0,">because only after one year it has seriously already become an addiction

Facts. This will be my 4th bothchella in a row. In my head I want to stop doing it but the thought of not being able to not have to worry about conflicts as much is really hard to give up. You'll have a great time this year being able to plan it out. It makes the weekend so much less stressful, and it's cool that depending on how you end up planning it out that it can feel like two totally different festivals between weekends. One other perk is it helps delay the onset of the post festival blues. By Sunday night I'm ready to be done."

How'd you like doing both weekends?"
politics,fgjqg1i,t1_fgjj8lg,1580849371.0,Yup. It’s so stupid. They’re doing early caucusing this year that should help out some but it’s still a bigger time commitment than it should be. Also way more prone to human error. Primaries are so much easier.
politics,fgjb12b,t1_fgj4fob,1580840425.0,"I caucused in Nevada last time for Bernie and even without the app it’s a shit show. Caucuses should all be changed to primaries where you go in and vote, then votes are counted. I was flabbergasted by the caucus process last time.

For anybody who’s unaware of the process, they put us in a classroom with one side of Bernie supporters, the other Hillary. Then they counted how many people were voting for each. Any undecideds had a few minutes to listen to people’s cases for each candidate then they had to vote. This was all out in the open, raising your hand style too, so really easy to miscount in a middle school classroom with 40 people in it. Then they had a packet that had “caucus math” in it to figure out the delegate count. It was some formula that said x amount of votes equates to y amount of delegates or some shit like that. It was crazy. It took a couple of hours to sit through too from the time you checked in, got a classroom, then it got filled up, counted etc."
plastidip,fgi14li,t1_fghkaoj,1580800839.0,"He's going to need specific equipment for plasti-dip. You can use an air compressor and hvlp gun with dip but you need the right sized tip. It's not the hardest stuff to spray but it's different than paint and he'll probably want to practice first, especially with using pearls which is what is used in the example you posted.

This video is pretty old from DYC. If you send them an email with it linked they'll spec out a kit for you. It'll be black for the base, a dip pearl top coat (glossy or matte), and pearls. They may not have the same pearls as this video but they might have something similar or they may have changed the name of this particular pearl. Regardless, they'll be able to help you. They're really easy to deal with and really helpful as well.

You can use the pearls in regular automotive paint but I don't know with this particular one if you'd get the same result as the video/thumbnail pic."
todayilearned,fghzlz5,t1_fgh6ds4,1580799114.0,I hear people bitch all the fucking time in Nevada about people coming from California. It’s more annoying than the people moving from California. I think the Californians have helped me enjoy Nevada a lot more than I used to. Like a lot of places the roads can’t keep up with the influx of people but that’s not something to blame Californians about.

politics,fggdbbl,t1_fgfzgsd,1580759467.0,"Thank you. I’ve been trying to tell my friends/family that think Bernie is too far left. The reality is that things have moved so far right that we could use a tug to the left instead of a moderate. A moderate won’t really change much and even as far left as some people think of Bernie he won’t be able to move things much more than a little left, which at this point I’ll take."

Coachella,fggaanm,t1_fgfxq80,1580757627.0,"Cannot recommend custom ear plugs enough!

For anybody interested I’d get on it now. It takes several weeks without paying extra to get plugs in (at least from ACS), and if they’re new it takes even longer. Add in getting an appointment with an audiologist for impressions and shipping time (if you’re not near an office) you’re looking at sometime toward the end of March.

For those that can’t afford the additional expense of custom plugs right now, take a look on amazon for musicians ear plugs. Etymotic, Hearos, eargasm, dubs etc. are all better than foam plugs and way better than no plugs."
Coachella,fgg9mvj,t1_fgfu1sb,1580757221.0,"Happy Birthday! 

Hitting PRs is great motivation to clean up the diet. Hopefully it’s not too hard getting back in line.

This week I’m right there with you. I’ve been feeling great about my workouts but my diet has been atrocious due to my birthday and the super bowl as well.

I’m cracking down on the diet as much as I can too. I’m traveling for work basically the rest of the month so a lot of eating out and makeshift lifting sessions depending on what equipment each hotel has. I don’t have too many special occasion events where I’m eating like I did this week though so that should be a big help.

Keep it up!"
Coachella,fgg8i49,t1_fgg7cfu,1580756527.0,No problem. Check the details on the RV park. Some of them offer private shuttles for guests to/from the festival.
Coachella,fgg690f,t1_fgg3017,1580755138.0,"Ride share to a shuttle stop. 

Ride sharing to the festival isn’t the worst but they do drop you off at the camping entrance and the security for walk ups into camping doesn’t fuck around. Super TSA style invasive. Then you have to make it through security from camping into the festival.

Ride sharing out of the festival from what I’ve read is nothing but a shit show, and it’s insane expensive. Like hundreds of dollars to Palm Springs expensive on top of several hours of waiting for a ride.

Ride sharing to/from the shuttle stop you likely won’t get touched in security, and you won’t be paying insane surge pricing. It’s no fun waiting for an Uber or lyft after taking a shuttle ride but it’s way cheaper and you’ll likely still get back sooner than waiting in the ride share line."
Coachella,fgft2bk,t1_fgf2oom,1580746985.0,"I’ve taken the shuttles every ear, and have shuttled then lyfted to a VRBO one weekend.

The shuttle stop for the VRBO was in La Quinta which is only a few miles away. I just checked my ride receipts for that weekend and I still wasn’t getting back to the house until after 2:00am, which felt brutal.

Every other weekend I’ve gone I’ve stayed in Palm Desert with the Albertsons shuttle stop right across the street from my hotel. Also don’t get there until after 2:00am, and it’s been as late as 3:30am.

I guess it depends on what you plan on doing, but I try to spend as much time at the festival. So after being in the sun, dancing, running, walking 12-15 miles each day for 12 hours, on top of being awake even longer when you count time getting ready and to the festival. At the end of the night, I’m wrecked and could not drive 30 minutes. So is just about everyone else on the shuttles and even the walk across the street can be a struggle. I couldn’t imagine having a longer shuttle ride since agua is further, then having to drive another 30-40 minutes in the dark.

I’d expect you wouldn’t be getting back to where you’re staying until sometime between 3:30 and 5:00am if you did park and ride from agua then drove out toward morongo staying until music stops.

If you don’t plan on drinking or doing any other substances, and don’t plan on getting into the festival until after 5:00pm then maybe it might be doable. But if you want to get in early, stay until the music stops, have the potential to drink or do anything else, you’re going to be so exhausted that making that drive in the dark after being at the fest is going to be incredibly dangerous. There’s not much traffic or street lights when you’re that far out. Really easy to fall asleep at the wheel.

30 minutes doesn’t sound so bad right now, but at the end of each night after a festival it’s going to feel like an eternity when all you want to do is close your eyes and get some rest."

Coachella,fg7tnxq,t1_fg7ox1q,1580601188.0,"Do not ride share if you’re that far away. You’ll be paying a fortune (likely over $300 each night) and waiting hours just to get a ride if you wait until the headliners are done each night.

Where is the Airbnb? How close to gates opening (11:30-12ish) do you plan on wanting to arrive? How late do you plan on wanting to stay? Music stops at 1:00am Friday/Saturday and 12:00am Sunday. If you can cancel or your Airbnb and find something closer that would be your best option. 

If that isn’t an option then the top comment is probably your best bet. Find the nearest park and ride shuttle stop and drive to/from there each night. You’re likely still looking at somewhere between 3:30 and 5:00am getting back to your Airbnb if you want to see the headliners/stay until close each night.

I’ve only used the shuttles but from what I’ve read parking still takes forever to clear out of day parking so you’re likely not going to save much of, if any time parking at the festival vs. a shuttle stop."

I make a playlist with recent set lists for each artist, then separate it out by day, and separate out the house/edm without lyrics.

Their batteries, 0-60 performance, and tech are enough to overcome those gripes because it’s not that important to a lot of consumers at the end of the day. Much the same way that people who are happy with driving a cheaper car because it still gets them from point a to point b comfortably so the extra money on a luxury or sports car doesn’t make sense to them.

My neighbor has a Model 3, I have an Audi, and he asked me if Audi would handle something that Tesla basically told him tough titties about. His doors weren’t lined up right so his drivers door was scratching the paint off the bottom of his passenger door behind the driver. He told them he wanted it fixed and they told him that’s basically the way it is and if they try to re-align the door that it’ll scratch a different spot or won’t open right. That’s the kind of thing that I would find unacceptable spending $100k+ on a Model S P100D that wouldn’t happen on the Porsche. The quality of materials and build will make being inside the car feel nicer when driving it, and will likely hold up much better. I also don’t want to have to wait three months to get a door, or bumper, which likely won’t happen with the Porsche since they’re a huge company.

I’m not hating on the Tesla, I think they’re doing great things but they aren’t perfect and there’s clearly room for competition in the EV market. Both cars have their place and the people that think the Porsche is silly for the cost are probably the same who wouldn’t buy a Porsche combustion car over something like a Honda or Toyota to begin with for similar reasons, which there’s nothing wrong with."
tech,ffjdoj8,t1_ffi822m,1579996091.0,"Tesla is a tech company that builds cars. They’re the best at battery tech, self driving tech, and regularly update their cars over the air for free to make improvements, similar to a computer OS. However, they aren’t great at making cars or quality control in their manufacturing. They have horrible paint, bad panel alignment, average interior (outside of the tech) and they don’t have the infrastructure to keep up with demand on making the cars/parts.

The Porsche won’t have the battery tech, or self driving tech, probably won’t have as many (or any at all) over the air updates as a Tesla, however it will hands down be a better built car in pretty much every other way. Porsche also has the manufacturing infrastructure Tesla doesn’t so their customers won’t be waiting months on parts for repairs like Tesla owners often do. I like Tesla, I want a model 3 and think it will be viewed almost as revolutionary as the Model T, but the Porsche is a nicer car even though it’s tech isn’t as good. 

The Model 3 is hands down a better value if you’re comparing performance but most of the customers that are looking at the Porsche would be looking at the Model S P100D not the model 3 anyway. If I’m spending over $100k on an electric car and looking at the Porsche or the Tesla I’d probably sacrifice Tesla’s tech and go for the Porsche since they’re really fucking good at making cars."

Coachella,fffq3md,t1_ffflzn4,1579889353.0,"Same, also the whole ""shitty phone video"" comment is ridiculous these days too. Optical image stabilization, way better mics, 1080p - 4k recordings make phone videos pretty great. I still generally take 30 second or less clips, but it's nice to watch them to take me back. Also, timestamps when dates/times get fuzzy, especially at festivals. I also don't really watch the screen when I'm recording the videos or taking pictures either. If they come out really well that's great, if they aren't framed well or something like that, it's not a big deal. They're for me and maybe some friends that ask to see them but that's about it.

I lived in the moment for years before cell phones were ubiquitous, then even more years before phones came out with cameras, and smart phones. I would kill for pictures/videos of the shows I went to when I was 13-25. Memories fade, those videos don't (barring getting deleted), and artists die or quit, band break up etc. so you never know when those things are going to become even more cherished."
Coachella,ffdfvnl,t1_ffd9v06,1579820015.0,"There were a couple years that I tried not taking many pictures or videos (mostly of sets and art, I don’t really take many of me) and I really regret it now. I was looking back the other day through the years of pictures and I forget which years they were but there were a couple where I took like 15 pictures total. It sucks. 

I see people recommending living in the moment and not taking pictures/videos, which if it works for them, that’s great, but it’s not for me. I’m not on my phone all day or taking hundreds of photos or recording entire sets, but I do take more throughout the weekend now that I see how much it sucks to not take very many."
Coachella,ffcqftr,t3_esx8w9,1579805074.0,They've been one of my favorite discoveries so far this year. I'm definitely curious to see their first festival set and how they set up the stage/lighting to keep their privacy intact.
Coachella,ffchv8y,t3_esvwm3,1579799797.0,"I can tell you that the Holiday Inn Express near the Albertsons stop does not have the after party vibe. Everybody goes to their rooms and goes to sleep at the end of the night, but it's also between 2-3:00am that you're getting back from the festival if you stay through headliners. There are people at the pool in the mornings and a lot of people eating breakfast in the lobby area but it's pretty chill and quiet. Most everyone is there for the festival but it's not really wild at all, and the hotel has strict quiet hours that everybody is respectful of. You can hear people pre-gaming in their rooms listening to music in the mornings but that's about it."

I prefer the Good Will Prevail and Ride Waves vibes over his bangerz.zip stuff but it’s all good and he does a good job mixing in a little bit of everything in his sets. 

Definitely one of my most anticipated of the festival, although I wish he was on Saturday or Sunday with how stupid stacked Friday is."

They were amazing. I wasn’t super familiar with a couple of the songs they played which usually bugs me at concerts but they were so good I didn’t care. The visuals were excellent, both the art they had playing on screen that was in the style of their music videos, and the lighting/lasers all worked really well together. Maynard sounded great, and the rest of the guys sounded really tight even with how complicated their tempos and beats are.

I’d absolutely go see them again and hope I get another chance so I can see the entire show."

I went back to my hotel room, changed, and got to the venue late (missed the first half) but got to my seat as they were starting schism. I’ve wanted to see them since the 90s so it was awesome to finally see them.

I like the new anti flag album even though it’s pretty short at just over 30 minutes.

New naked and famous is pretty good too.

I’ve got SNBRN coming up at the end of next month and Elohim in San Diego in March. Probably won’t go to much else before Coachella."
