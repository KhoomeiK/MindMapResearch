Those are facts though? It’s true men have a higher chance to commit suicide and woman have a higher chance to ATTEMPT suicide. They aren’t devaluing men committing suicide they are simply acknowledging another group of people who do. It sounds more likely you’re trying to make this a “we’re more oppressed” situation."

AskReddit,ffgjtwe,t1_fffsg7f,1579907882.0,"That is literally the worst idea for today’s life due to costs. 

So girls no longer had the freedom to work,

But in the context of this question it’s about male suicide, bruh, you know how much stress that would be for all guys to do all the job work? Back in the day some guys were most likely still stressed, but today the costs of living is so much higher than back than, including the costs of education, of course it’s not impossible my mother was a single mom cause my father cheats twice and she still raised me but it was a *lot of stress*. 

So it’s pretty ideal today to have 2 working partners tbh, of course if you’re having a child the dad or mother could still have a baby sitter and such or take care of them but back in the past it was more like woman couldn’t work because people didn’t allow them. The majority of the time they just repeatedly did house chores and stuff, they have time to still have a job and help their partner with the bills.

It’s good in modern day to have both the partners  to at least be able to get a job and help the other’s person’s stress by paying the bills and/or taking care of the kids."

AskReddit,ffgfnhj,t1_ffgcto4,1579905165.0,"what they mean by “toxic masculinity” is acts like believing men have to be strictly more masculine and if they’re not it’s bad. Like for example, if a man cries people think that’s not good which is toxic masculinity, they’re making it turn into a thing that prevents the man from showing emotions and such.

Masculinity is good, just not when it’s things like “men can’t cry, wear dresses” etc"
