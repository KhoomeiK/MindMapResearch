Or how about not having sex when people are home, known to not knock, don't know, and a door without a lock. Anyone could have guessed this had a high probability of happening and he decided to take 0 precautions."

worldnews,ff3kxxv,t1_ff3g6ma,1579543251.0,I guess it depends on what it means by opposition. Anti Kremlin and opposition marches from a group named Opposition seems to justify the use of the word. But I agree there probably isn't much pressure to do anything.

From what I can gather from a few quick googles, a bath is about 36 gallons. A shower uses about 2 gallons a minute. So a 40 minute shower would use the same water as about (let's just be generous and round down) 2 baths. Wasteful and a waste of money. She can do that using her water."
