Also, if you want variety, go buy a couple cheap-ish wigs (I got mine for $30-40 each). They're way easier to wear when you're bald, but you can continue to wear them as your hair grows out :)

Perhaps you could go to the group once or twice just to feel it out and, after you've given it a try, tell your dad your honest opinion on it. If you show him you've tried his suggestion and it doesn't work for you, he may be more open to getting you some one-on-one help.

Personally, I find group therapy to cause more anxiety rather than helping it, but you might be able to take to the therapist for a few minutes yourself to get some tips on how to explain this to your dad. They might alsobe willing to directly recommend one-on-one therapy directly to him.

Hopefully you get some help! Anxiety can really cause a lot of problems and, at least for me, it was the cause of a lot of my ""hypochondria"" when I was a kid. You don't know what's wrong, but you know there's *something* wrong."

They don't just come and tase you and lock you in a cell. Even when I was committed for six months, it was in an open ward with regular rooms. It's a pain in the ass to have them check on you every half hour at night, but unless you're being violent, they would absolutely never use those tactics on you."

I know you said it's an LDR, but if they hold her for more than 72 hours and you can arrange to visit her (or at last if her family can), I highly recommend it as a familiar face can make it *way* less stressful and is very reassuring. If nothing else, she may be able to use the phone - you could ask her parents for the hospital information and let her hear your voice."

jacksonville,fd510f5,t1_fd3dltg,1578173122.0,"That's exactly it. They want more riders but increase the price, which makes public transportation even more off-putting than it already is. Our bus system is awful anyway. The stop closest to me picks up every hour and the next closest is over a mile away. It took me at an hour and a half to get to my former workplace that's a 15 minute straight shot drive down the road from my apartment, but I have to take three different buses to get there.

It is what it is, I guess. At least we have *something* for public transport, but at some point, it's worth $4 more to just take a lyft."

PainManagement,fd29bgg,t3_ejw8kp,1578143714.0,"You probably don't want to go on methadone (and, honestly, with it mostly being an addiction therapy drug, you're not likely to get a script here, you'd be going to a methadone clinic - I was unable to convince a doctor to switch me to methadone).

If you have a responsible doctor, they will wean you off opiates. I wouldn't suggest going on Suboxone to avoid withdrawal either as you'll basically be blacklisted and unable to get opioid pain medication in the future.

You could try kratom, but I'm not sure howyour intestines would react to something like that.

I highly recommend you post this in r/opiates as they're usually extremely helpful.

Edit: also, try r/chronicpain

This sub is tiny and not very active so you likely won't get many responses.

Edit 2: If you're in Jax like you mentioned in a comment in another sub, *definitely* don't go on Suboxone. I decided to try it for my pain when oxycodone stopped working and I've been fucked and not taken seriously for the last 18 months."

As far as the referral question goes, definitely call your insurance and ask them.

I haven't been to the Jacksonville location, but I did go to the Rochester location (in 2006, for chronic pain and not POTS) and they were very thorough. For me, it was three full days of testing, but I drove there from my apartment an hour away each day.

Have you seen a regular neurologist about your issues? I had a bunch of autonomic testing done by a neurologist in Ohio (I've moved around quite a bit, but she did things like a tilt-table test, which is at least one of the things they'll probably have you do) and that's usually the first stop."

AmItheAsshole,fbxayh0,t1_fbx9lwn,1577177716.0,"That's probably because we give different names to different forms. Like ""ham"" and ""bacon"" and ""ribs"" (since the default for thatis automatically pork) instead of just ""pork"" because they're specific cuts, etc. ""Pork"" is typically reserved for ""pork chops"" or ""pork loin."" 

I don't eat most pork products because the texture is just of-putting for some reason (though I do like bacon on occasion). I'm still not sure how an American adult doesn't know something pretty basic like that though."
