DaystromInstitute,ffj96nd,t1_ffj12yu,1579993398.0,">No, there is no reasonable grounds for treating people you know better than those you don’t.

They constitute the support structure which allows the Federation to exist. They provide resources and material to Starfleet. They bear the impact of decisions made on Earth. Starfleet just got out of the Dominion War in 2375 and was probably providing assistance to the Cardassians, which the Federation had already been in a war with even before the Dominion. The Federation suffered ""heavy"" casualties (this is never really explicitly specified onscreen), and planets were occupied.

During that conflict, the Romulans were apparently willing to sit back and let them get slaughtered for part of that time, only coming around until their senator got murdered.

>Loosing 90,000 people (really a tiny amount in the world of Trek), should not make you want to allow the death of 900 million.

Those were probably the people most qualified to deal with the evacuation, and the people qualified to build ships for the evacuation. Along with, of course, the ships for the evacuation. The vast majority of ships in Starfleet probably aren't going to be appropriate for mass evacuation. Just imagine trying to evacuate 900 million people with ships the size of Voyager (crew size 200).

Even assuming you used *Galaxy*\-class ships - which Starfleet originally only had 6 of - it would still take 60,000 ships to evacuate 900 million people, if you did it all in one go. This is tens of thousands more ships of *any* kind than people usually estimate Starfleet to even have. The Galaxy-class is listed as having an evacuation limit of 15,000 people.

Even if you split it up, if you had a year with all the ships, and it was an average round-trip time of a week, you'd still need over 1100 *Galaxy-*class ships.

But again, the Galaxy-class is represented as a much larger ship than the average Starfleet ship. If we look at the *Intrepid* and *Nebula*\-class's evacuation limit of 9,800 persons, then you'd need over 1800 ships.

Starfleet struggled to put together fleets of hundreds of ships even when it was on a war footing with the Dominion. It couldn't even muster more than a hundred against the Borg Cube in First Contact, even though it was on a direct course for Earth. If Starfleet can't put together a larger fleet for the Borg, or can't justify putting together a larger fleet for the Borg, then it suggests it isn't just anti-Romulan prejudice.

To add to all of this, a supernova wasn't a gradual thing. Up until it hit, the Romulan military and its resources would still be functional. A military whose defining characteristic had pretty much been duplicity. Starfleet would have to consider the possibility that the Romulans might turn on it right after the evacuation. It's exactly how they responded in *The Next Phase*.

Last but not least, it wasn't a guaranteed death sentence for the Romulans. Had Spock been successful, then the supernova would not have reached Romulus (although they probably still would've had to evacuate since their sun would've now been a black hole).

I think this is going to come down to it have been very risky or costly for Starfleet to help the Romulans (not in terms of cash, but in terms of decades of people’s life’s research being lost and other smaller humanitarian missions for Federation members being left incomplete as ships are retasked). Starfleet decided in the overall strategic picture, it would leave the Federation to vulnerable.

There’s no equivalent to TOS or TNG in there. A lot of these series are about trying to get to or preserve a certain state of being, which the Pike show could portray."
DaystromInstitute,ffhobgp,t3_eto3sw,1579945146.0,"I don’t think it’s as one-sided as Picard makes it sound. Every hero ship of the TNG era except for the Enterprise-E was built at the Utopia Planetia shipyards. All the design work we’ve heard about took place there. The Federation clearly felt like it was pushing things by constructing and marshaling the refugee fleet.

So the attack on Utopia Planetia may have been analogous to if East Asia suffered some unmitigated disaster leading up to the release of a new iPhone, but people still expected Apple to fulfill their orders on time “because it’s the right thing to do”. Although since R&D took place on Mars, it might also be analogous to if their headquarters was lost too. Yeah, there would still be other offices elsewhere, but the entire logistical network would need to be built from the ground up.

Picard’s proposed solution was probably to pull regular starships off duties of exploration or science to address the humanitarian need. In aggregate, this would probably set research back by hundreds of years due to experiments that have to be terminated or moved.

Meanwhile, Starfleet probably still has to worry about keeping a technological edge over the Dominion.

And retasking all those personnel to rescue efforts would end up drawing focus and resources away from Utopia Planetia, which would take decades or hundreds of years to rebuild. In the meantime, Starfleet would be caught flat-footed if an unexpected threat arose. Which it had, repeatedly, just a few decades back.

And on top of that, the Federation would be voluntarily shouldering the burden of caring for and policing millions and millions of potentially hostile refugees. Planets would need to be colonized, and refugees would need to be taught. A lot of Romulan and colonization experts probably died in the attack; you’d wind up with experts in adjacent fields like, say, protein specialists coming up with solutions for people to feed themselves. It might not end well.

Meanwhile, the Klingon Empire and everyone else would probably take advantage of Starfleet being undermanned, overwhelmed, and unable to rebuild. With its logistical base heavily damaged, Starfleet might be relatively toothless in any negotiations or conflict that might arise."

They’re obviously desperate for Soong Androids, he can’t guarantee that they might turn around and report Juliana Tainer as a possible research subject (and a violation of the ban on synths).

Remember, this is JLP who is willing to uphold the rights of an individual even when they might be trampled by the greater good. He would argue that Juliana Tainer does not have an obligation to help Picard or even Data. He would feel it would be immoral of him to unilaterally put her life at any risk by directly reaching out to her and discussing the issue when the communications could be compromised.

Starfleet doesn’t want footage of what appear to be its own special forces / police shooting up a flesh-and-blood girl on the roof of Starfleet Headquarters, but they also don’t want to deal with the political fallout of Romulan agents pursuing a flesh and blood synth that’s supposed to be impossible to exist. Both because of the problems it would cause with the Romulan Remnant, and also because they don’t want everybody to start accusing each other of being a synth (It’s the Cylon problem from Battlestar Galactica all over again). So they fix Picard up enough to pass the cover story that he passed out on the roof and send him home, while quietly repairing all the damage (shouldn’t take long, just park a shuttle with an industrial replicator over the roof).

For two, I assumed that most likely “galactic” means the Federation and Klingon Empire, which are basically the dominant powers in the Alpha / Beta quadrant now. And I assume it was mostly being pushed by the Federation, with the Klingons going along with it because “well synths are without honor anyway”. The Dominion would probably agree to it on the grounds that creating new types of solids is going in the wrong direction. It’s an easy diplomatic win for them.

The galactic comment does also raise the intriguing possibility that the Federation is using Quantum Slipstream now and has expanded into the delta quadrant as well.

Three makes me wonder if the goal could have been to get Picard to look for Dahj’s twin. Say, if the Romulans want to fly the Borg cube of theirs around, but they’ve found it’s only keyed to interface with drones. But all the Borg drones connected to the hive mind were wiped out by the neurolytic pathogen, so that would leave Picard, Seven, Hugh, and whatever other former drones exist.

> Romulans should’ve killed that synth in Picard’s house as he’s explaining Dahj who she is.

There isn’t much tech in Chateau Picard, and there’s the handwavy comment about a cloaking device. They may be limited to tracking her with local sensors. Or they may have known she was at Chateau Picard, but weren’t sure they could extract / kill her without Picard and the staff knowing. So then they’d have to incapacitate Picard and the staff, and the whole thing would risk becoming a scandal.

Once she was at Starfleet Command though, then it was a huge risk that they might lose access to her. Picard would be expected to have an immense amount of personal connections within Starfleet, and in a second she could beam to a ship and they’d be completely cut off from her. So beyond just there being tech there to track her, they may have decided the imminent threat of her escape justified taking the huge risk of exposure.

Plus she couldn’t defend herself without revealing herself, so they may have expected her to retreat to someplace isolated rather than going to the space cops.

I have to jump through a lot of hoops to explain why even people who don’t know about the color temperature hypothesis are affected if this is all supposed to be placebo. I suspect there’s an important nuance here that isn’t being grasped, but I haven’t read the paper in enough detail to hypothesize.

EDIT: One thing that bugs me right off the bat. They say blue is associated with twilight, but that’s not entirely true. At least in film pro classes, blue was represented as the color of morning; golden yellow the color of evening. Granted, it’s moreso that way in LA in other places...

I suspect that what they’re doing is coming up with much lower intensities than you’d typically see from a screen or a lamp, so it isn’t enough to trigger significant activation of the rgcs. Thus the low amplitude is the protective factor against activation rather than the color temperature being substantially different from the color temperature of the light needed to activate the cells."

I also couple it with 30mg nortriptyline that seems to potentiate it despite it just being known for antihistamine sedation for this purpose. I’ve had some doctors tell me they don’t understand how it’s working with so little, other doctors are not too surprised because of research into very small dosages.

AskReddit,ff8699z,t1_ff7rvf5,1579667161.0,"With melatonin it’s important to note that timing, amount, and kind (sublingual or oral) are all important.

For instance I take 150 **micro**grams (mcg), not milligrams (mg) ideally around 7pm. I notice a major difference if it’s an hour later, sometimes even fifteen minutes will make a difference. This is an oral tablet.

I’m thinking of switching to sublingual so there’s less variation based on what else is in my stomach, but I haven’t figured out how to translate the dosing yet."

The ones that usually cause people trouble are delayed sleep phase disorder and non-24 (which is rare if you aren’t blind).

I personally believe there are a variety of contributing factors - retinal ganglion cells that are genetically predisposed to be more sensitive in some people, or clock gene mutations. Unfortunately the exact cause doesn’t really help unless it’s something else. Sleep apnea and depression can both screw with your sleep schedule too so you should try to see a sleep doctor to rule them out. For instance, melatonin is synthesized from serotonin so if your serotonin system is out of whack in the right way, that’d probably mess with both your mood and sleep schedule. Unfortunately I haven’t heard of any reliable way to test for serotonin levels or brain neurotransmitter levels in general, at least not in a clinical setting.

As such there are a ton of recommendations for sleep hygiene. In my experience, the most important thing to not exacerbate things is modulating light exposure. Learn to tell the difference between warm yellow and blue lamps. Don’t use your giant computer screen at bedtime. Get lots of light in the morning. Stay away from bluish lights at bedtime. Replace them if you have to.

There are light boxes and that’s what’s been recommended for me to do, but it’s tough. In my case, I take about 150mcg of melatonin + 30 mg nortriptyline about 7pm ideally and make sure I get light in the morning. This seems to get my body on the right track although it’s easy to break out of it and takes a few days to recover.

Note that not all light boxes are the same, there are different luminosities and color temperatures.

Also install f.flux or other software to shift your screen towards yellow to red in the evening in case you can’t help but use your monitor.

There’s even been one person I knew who didn’t have this pattern, but complained that they had trouble falling asleep during the weekdays, and I pointed out that the lab they worked in had such bright fluorescent lights that I avoided it because it would keep me up. After they got an alternative light and switched those off it got easier for them.

Not every sleep Doctor will know about this, you probably want to speak with one who comes from a neurological rather than pulmonary background. If they don’t know about it then I’d ask them to ask around and find someone who does. It’s honestly a very niche issue and I’ve talked to at least one resident who seemed to have no clue how it worked.

Melatonin actually sort of shifts your circadian rhythm (light is the other big player here). Nortriptyline is just an antihistamine sedative, at least as far as sleep is concerned. There are wakefulness aids like Nuvigil that I’ve tried but have avoided them because I don’t think they’re treating the problem, and I still feel like crap mentally. Ideally you shouldn’t have to use nuvigil unless you just need to have the B-level superpower of being unable to fall asleep for 14 hours.

But yeah the thing about circadian rhythm disorders is that you are essentially fighting your body’s own physiology to force it into an unnatural sleep schedule. Like asking a tall person to hunch down all the time to fit in a short floor. One hypotheses for delayed sleep phase disorder and non-24 is that people’s sleep-wake rhythm is naturally more like 25 hours.

Regular people have the same kind of problems as someone with delayed sleep phase disorder if they’re forced to work nights, see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_work_sleep_disorder

Unfortunately many people don’t see this as “different” but as “lazy” or inferior, and think you just have to put “mind over matter”. Some people can understand and accept the idea of someone who is inherently physiologically different from them, others can’t."
AskReddit,ff83v23,t1_ff7qeld,1579665282.0,"Chronotherapy like this can sometimes turn delayed sleep phase disorder into non-24. Not a doctor, but from personal experience I’d try a light box first thing at the desired wake time or very low-dose melatonin (**micro**grams) 12+ hours before you want to wake up before this route. Of course, you’re supposed to get a sleep study done too and get evaluated by a doctor to rule out sleep apnea and depression (or other issues)."

DaystromInstitute,ff7r2hp,t3_es0smx,1579656291.0,"I'd really like to see a ""Federation meets the Culture"" miniseries or movie. I think it'd be a fresh story. But I think it would be too much of an irreversible change to the universe to introduce them in the Milky Way Galaxy. 

So I'd do it more like a crossover. Have a Starfleet ship accidentally or intentionally get pulled to some distant galaxy. The Culture is deciding (decades or hundreds of years ahead) whether it wants to establish contact with the Milky Way. It has determined from monitoring the galaxy that the Federation has the closest set of values to the Culture and is most likely to be compatible. It then gives the crew challenges to execute in its galaxy to see how they fare.

It'd be a fun way to deconstruct the tropes - like pushing a button to drop out of warp with enough precision timing to not plow through a planet, manually aiming at ships traveling faster than light, and that kind of thing. The crew could wind up realizing that the only way they can compete is to accept some of the transhumanist modifications, and have to deal with that very different set of values.

In the end, the Culture could decide not to make contact, given how much even the handpicked representatives of the Milky Way struggle to accept the norms, but the Starfleet ship opts to stay and continue a mission of exploration of the new galaxy. Out of universe, this'd give them some options as to how to pick it up (or whether to)."

In ANH, Luke goes from rednecking it up in a T-16 to being able to hold his own in dogfighting tactics against professional pilots. But he explicitly wants to be a pilot, so we can cut some slack by assuming he was specifically learning about this. And he’s shit with a lightsaber.

In TFA, iirc, Rey is an amazing pilot right off the bat, and can do a decent job against friggin Kylo Ren with a lightsaber with no training whatsoever. The plot needs her to do those things for gripping action sequences and obligatory lightsaber combat, so she can do them.

After that, the training is comparable. Luke trains with Yoda in ESB, Rey trains with Luke in TLJ. Luke trains by himself through ROTJ and all Yoda really does is sign his figurative diploma. Rey trains with Leia in TROS.

Now, in ST:2009 it’s just insanely ridiculous. Kirk goes from misbehaving cadet to Captain of the Enterprise in, what, a week? Days?

But in addition, we see Yoda with a bunch of younglings with short training lightsabers.
