I compared it to Cities: Skylines in a another comment because imo it's much more of a city builder than a classic RTS-game. If you don't like simply building a city but need constant gameplay, things to do, it can be boring. There are a lot of times where there is simply nothing to do and all you can do is marvel at the city and watch everybody working. Some like that, some not.

>Balancing growth and materials stocks is a challenge that is plagued by issues with distribution (especially among different warehouses/markets) and the inability to just select citizens and move them to a job, house or path was frustrating at times.

I too thought that's a struggle, but a good one, because RTS-games tend to get easier and easier with time so it was nice to see that even a big city can struggle with the production of certain goods. The distribution of the workers on the houses isn't perfect at all, i give you that. Tbh i simply don't give a fuck about it and just build houses if they're necessary. Worked so far.

I really liked the housing system on the other hand, and that villagers have to start their own family in their own hut to get children. It's not just a matter of creating villagers/building homes, but you have to build them gradually so you won't get too few/too many. Deathwaves are a thing too - again, really similar to CS.

You can start with the vanilla-game on easy mode and no catastrophes which is still challenging but not frustrating. The game is easy to get if you played RTS games before but there is lots to do and it also doesn't get boring in the long run. There is also the ""Colonial Charter""-Mod which adds **a lot** of new buildings and recources and makes the game truely awesome.
