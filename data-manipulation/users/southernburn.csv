If you know, for sure, that you can't take care of a child at this point in your life than I believe that it probably was the right decision.

The pain, nausea and cyst alone warrants thr visit. At the ER they will more than likely do an ultrasound so you will have results noow, not in 4 more miserable weeks! All cysts do not go away on their own, I have had 3 removed (along with zapping my endometriosis). If you have flu like symptoms along with the others , the cyst may be infected. NEVER be embarrassed to take charge of your healthcare, because you know your own body better than a phone nurse. Good luck sweetie!"
