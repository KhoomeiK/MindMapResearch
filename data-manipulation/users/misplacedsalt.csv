Badcompanies,ffab7cp,t3_ebp2lj,1579731485.0,"The ""Confederate flag"" really doesn't exist.  It is the Northern Virginia battle flag. And it was created before the first wave of the KKK.  
The flag has nothing to do with slavery or racism.  It was designed to identify the troops of that regime. 
The civil war was not a war about slavery,  it was about the union imposing themselves onto the Confederate states. 
Do the research. I know many people wont and would much rather follow the flock. 
I was born in the north and raised down south. As an adult, I've lived in northern states as well. I've seen both sides of the coin and ive seen racism everywhere I go.
BTW, if you do decide to research,  look where the largest Klan rallies were.... (hint: up north)"
