Detroit,ffuy504,t1_fftzwd6,1580251570.0,"That makes since.  Thank you for that info.

I keep seeing that 'skimming money' comment and know I know what it is short for.

I saw a story about a year ago about a couple of guys in the Detroit area who patch potholes using their own gear for free.  The city (maybe Hamtramic???) agreed to let them do it as long as they notified them as to what roads they would be working on.  They do it for a fraction of the cost it normally costs the city."

Detroit,ffremv5,t1_ffr8s18,1580156531.0,"I keep hearing people say that, but I'm curious where the claim comes from.  What money was skimmed off the top?  


What I do know about the situation is that about 2/3rds of what was collected at the pump went to pay off old road related debts where we borrowed money to make repairs years ago.  That, as far as I know, is the biggest issue we face regarding road repairs.  We can't just not pay off our debts.  


However, for the sake of finding a proper solution, please fill me in on why you said what you did."

AskReddit,ffqyfy4,t1_ffng6kl,1580146459.0,"I use to work PR for the Navy.  Over and over again I saw the knee jerk reaction to simply not disclose information because it looked bad.  Not cover up.  Not lie.  But not release it.  


After what I heard that day, I can't help but wonder if we did shoot it down, then turned them into heroes the nation could rally around.    


There will always be a lot of back and forth on this issue, and I don't believe we'd ever get a straight answer short of a death bed confession from the pilot/pilots involved.  Even then, I'm willing to bet the contingency would be planned upon and countered ('official' records which contradict said statements).  


I simply don't know either way, and will never say definitively that we did.  I've never really looked at any of the other evidence for or against my opinion on the matter.  I'm rather surprised so many people have chimed in on this.  I think this is the most activity I've seen when posting about this (I always voice it whenever this question pops up in the sub)."

An eye witness called into Howard Stern shortly after it went down in the field, and clearly stated US Military were already there at the time of the airborn explosion.  The caller went on to say that the jets fired upon the plane.  Now normally I would dismiss this, but the kicker is that the call was edited out of the release of the 9/11 broadcast later released by the show.
