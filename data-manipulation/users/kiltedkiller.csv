todayilearned,ffd84sg,t1_ffcewcx,1579815274.0,The ice cream machines at Dairy Queen are just a large churn. The mix is in large bags in their walk-in fridge and are pumped into the back of the machines. Paddles turn constantly and the mix is churned and chills as it moves forward. Once it reaches the front it is solid enough to be soft serve and hold its shape. When it is busy the mix can be used faster than it takes to freeze and so you have to wait for it to firm up. It’s just a giant ice cream churn on its side with a corkscrew paddle.

Yes it is a blog, but the claims made about pesticide use and toxicity have their sources annotated."
AskReddit,fcl7n2c,t1_fcl6k9n,1577741566.0,That’s actually false too. Many organic crops have to use broad spectrum pesticides that are less effective and have less staying power. This leads to a lot of organic farms using more pesticides than traditional farming along with more water and land for less yield. Organic is bad for the environment and have no health benefits over traditional and gmo crops.

todayilearned,fbvod4u,t1_fbvc4kd,1577133720.0,"I had a guy seize the first day of a college lecture class and it was the smoothest I’ve ever seen a medical emergency. The guy stood up rigidly while yelling, then fell over. A guy sitting behind him jumped over his chair to tend to him, the professor kept everyone calm. Someone was already calling 911 and I called the campus police to coordinate with EMS. I worked for campus housing and in staff training they told us to call campus police along with EMS because when called from a cell phone EMS didn’t always know the address for buildings on campus or how to get to them quickly. 15 min after it started the guy was carted out and we continued class."
