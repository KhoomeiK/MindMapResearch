facepalm,fgtk77o,t3_f0at2x,1581105576.0,"I love to jump into Peta related threads with this nugget of knowledge because I feel like not enough people know this: 

The common reason a lot of people think Peta is bad is because of a website that is petakillsanimals . Com. That website is 100% run and funded by a group called The Center for Consumer Freedom. I won't link to either because I don't want to give them traffic, but I encourage you to look at the wikis.

That organization is a *meat, tobacco and alcohol lobby.* Which I mean given what it lobbies for, is completely in the market to derail movements like Peta and veganism. It's meant to mislead people into believe a grassroots organization just wants to save animals, when in reality they are the ones profiting off of the slaughter of millions of animals a year. This organization spreads misinformation intentionally about things like the health affects of tobacco, so they are not reliable at all.

Also they misrepresent what Peta actually does. They provide euthanasia services for shelters that are run purely off of public donations and can't really afford the euthanasia for the super sick animals that wind up in their care. Rather then letting them slowly die, Peta provides funding for euthanasia. This is because Peta's message has never been ""let's never ever kill animals ever"" but is literally ""people for the ethical treatment of animals"" and providing euthanasia for animals that will otherwise suffer, is 100% in line with treating animals ethically. People don't seem to realize that. 

This all being said, I realize some of Peta marketing tactics can lack taste and respect and I don't really support them due to those campaigns. I do however agree with them showing slaughterhouse footage and other gross videos though, anyone offended by that needs to realize where their food comes from.  I think we all need to realize we can not fully agree with everything they say, but also realize that most of the criticisms they get are actually based in corporate funded lies."

vegan,fgp9d0q,t1_fgp8io7,1581000003.0,"New studies can use new technology and understanding. It's generally accepted that older studies on things like psychology, physiology, and nutrition are less reliable because of the new research into things like DNA, and improving micro technology. That has nothing to do with *combustion* (not combination) engines which are common place inventions that work. 


Those are inventions not a study on an animals using 1983's technology and understanding of physiology. 

Companies that fund or post studies for profit have a motivation to mislead you to believe something that promotes their products. The best example is the research that cigarette companies have done to downplay the effects of smoking before the Surgeon Generals report. There is nothing wrong with profit, but marketing disguised as ""science"" is universally considered not reliable. 

I listen to opposing views against veganism all day. Yours is one that is easily debunked and done without citations. 


People on Reddit downvoting things,* I never *. 


Speaking of not listening to other people's views, did you read that psychology today article or no?"
unpopularopinion,fgp8ful,t1_fgp6bpf,1580999400.0,"You suggested anyone arguing for inclusion in media needs to also advocate for equality in imprisonment. 

Media is not the same as the prison system. Having equal representation in media is not negatively affecting anyone's sovereignty. You need to take in the nuance of what you are talking about because being absolutist doesn't prove your point here."

So you've posted a study that is over *30 years old* from a publication Journal of Dairy Science. Which is funded by the following for-profit groups: Grande Cheese Company, Global Agri Trade Corp (they sell livestock feed), Arm & Hammer Animal Nutrition (also sells feed) among other for-profit companies... 

Here is a easy readers breakdown of animals being capable of love from Psychology Today. Iirc that was your original argument which you have strayed from.

I think you're full of shit. 

The fact that you think because someone didn't reply to you is ""winning"" says a lot more about why you engage in discussions. It's not to discuss, it's because your fragile ego wants to seem smarter and you can walk away ""winning"" .... Yikes man .

Anyway, claims made without citations will be dismissed as such."
unpopularopinion,fgp1gl4,t1_fgon6vo,1580994152.0,"You said ""equal representation in prisons"" 

Which is really bizarre conclusion. I have no idea how you expect to achieve that without trying to jail more women just to make it equal.

Making an award show more diverse or commenting on it, shouldn't lead to the next logic leap to be ""well if you want diversity we should lock more women up!"" 

Advocating for imprisoning more of a group of people *because* others advocate for equality is honestly a scary thought you've had. You need time to reflect on what you've suggested with that."
