facepalm,ffjpjbc,t3_etrovf,1580003721.0,Idk. That seems a lot like satire to me
facepalm,feev1qi,t1_fecb0qe,1579041827.0,"IIRC this was a poorly constructed awareness campaign at a college and was removed extremely quickly because nobody agreed with it. 

This was bad. 
Both parties are in a bad place.
Anyone can be victimized. 

But no. Women arent always listened to. Victims arent always listened to. This piece of awareness media was bad and wrong and not helpful to anyone."
veganrecipes,feed8a9,t3_eofi4n,1579031352.0,"Wait... does that mean it's made of.... shepherds?!?

Just kidding. Looks amazing, OP! Cannot wait to try it"
memes,fdys5a6,t3_en969v,1578783006.0,"People really think Jedis are ""good"" and Sith are ""bad"". Incorrect. 
Jedi are neutral. Jedi maintain force balance. Sith pervert the force and make it unbalanced."
funny,fdkxn02,t1_fdj07l4,1578513270.0,"It's weird cause I haven't seen that many memes about it, and I fobt really care about this speech. Some of his previous ones were much worse."
memes,fdkx7rp,t1_fdkq7wn,1578513020.0,"Yikes. I dont even know why I got downvoted. I felt like I was being pretty mild. 

Hes not hilarious. Hes pretty funny.
But then he makes the same trans joke that every person who's never gotten to know a trans person makes and its just...  low effort? Boring? Overdone? 

The best comedy is experience and perception based. You look at what your life is, what you see around you, and you think about it. Then you make a joke. His jokes often dont stay in the thinking section long enough. He makes basic jokes, or says something dumb and vaguely hypocritical like ""don't you dare talk about politics at the golden globes"" and its just... meh"
memes,fdkodmm,t1_fdkm2fl,1578507776.0,"That's not really true. Lots of things get under his skin. Political activism he disagrees with, for one. Hed probably still complain (albeit, much less so) about a political speech he agreed with.

Ricky G is okay. Hes alright. Hes pretty funny. But he also makes super baseline, unfunny jokes about marginalized people and other shit hes never experienced so has no understanding to write a joke about."
facepalm,fdgwoty,t1_fdgn1v8,1578410187.0,"I dont like that you said ""even when mixed with pit"" like pitties are not stable or healthy or good pets. Other than that, I agree with what you said. 
Pits are good pets!"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdfvp7q,t1_fdff2f7,1578371470.0,What does it tell you?
WTF,fda4weg,t1_fd97c0d,1578241712.0,The police were dispatched as soon as the 911 op had an address. She was trying to keep them on the phone by asking questions.  It also serves to give extra information to police.
WTF,fda4deh,t1_fd7g7en,1578241480.0,I'm sure the operator said so several times. But in a stressful and scary situation it's normal to feel impatient and ask again and again for help
GusAndEddy,fcufqsn,t3_eil6rt,1577979879.0,My gross fiance peed 3 times yesterday. Even after I told him NO. Hes so dumb I hate him
WTF,fc7e8d6,t1_fc7c0zt,1577504814.0,Did you mean empathy? I would assume  being forced to kill the animals you eat would give you empathy.
AskReddit,fburw14,t1_fbtnxgv,1577119382.0,"Can confirm. Just shaved for the 3rd time with mine. The shave is so close, and I've only nicked myself once. It just takes a little more patience.

I'm still looking for an eco friendly, cost effective option for the ~more sensitive~ areas, but I love my razor.

Am a lady, btw"
