fatlogic,fc6owa3,t3_eggw5m,1577485780.0,Her weight loss took years not over night. That type of effort takes dedication. She's a role model to me cause she didn't give up.
fatlogic,fc4qxwv,t3_eg684i,1577425194.0,"It's kinda abusive, the language is saying, ""What you want is wrong, do what I want you to do. Don't listen to those people who are encouraging you. They're all wrong. Don't trust your feelings or judgement."" 

Isn't that what abusers do they gaslight and try to isolate you from the people who care about you?"
fatlogic,fc4pweb,t3_ef3z98,1577424181.0,"I hate that people are treating this like her weight loss happened instantly.

Adele's been losing weight for the past decade. It only looks sudden cause we only see celebrities during special events, something to promote, tabloids. Not everyday. Look at her album covers her face has been slimming down over time. 

It takes time to gain the weight and it takes time to lose it. Consistency is hard. She should be praised for not giving up."
fatlogic,fbaiymi,t3_ecd2od,1576679402.0,This person is just hearing what they want. It's classic Amberlynn talk. They'll change doctors/dietician/nutritionist/lifestyle in a week. Once things get hard suddenly it becomes problematic and time to change.
