aww,fdpw79k,t1_fdmu5vl,1578643049.0,"Thank you, that's very kind of you to say :)
I thought of one more my sister told me- if you want to captain the Mark Twain she said you can approach a Disney cast member and ask if they have a captain yet. You will ""steer"" the steamboat and she said they give you something afterwards that says you were the captain. Fun for kids ! 
If I go back again I'm going to ask her for tips *before* I go instead of hearing about them after I come back :)"
aww,fdpvvxi,t3_em3psv,1578642664.0,"My sister suggested splash mountain when you arrive at the park, not at night,  although when we went to Disneyland, after we hit the Halloween themed haunted mansion,  we did see people on the ride at night. They were riding while other people were watching the water/fireworks show."

We didn't have huge lines though."
aww,fdpvjt3,t1_fdnmi67,1578642253.0,"We stood in the Haunted Mansion (Halloween themed) line at Disneyland and the Indiana Jones single rider line in Tokyo but other than that no other lines for rides. 
We did line up for Halloween Mickey, marvel character photos, Frozen, & the dark side but had photos done with our own cameras. We brought food into the park some days to cut costs."
aww,fdpvasu,t1_fdnmi67,1578641953.0,"I'll look for the card they gave me. Maybe it was a special or something but it was definitely cheap like $10 to get all of your digital images for that day (not printed). We didn't end up doing it because of the lines & because we realized too late that it was a thing, instead we took our own selfies of the same area but beside the lines."

aww,fdmszal,t1_fdmrgmb,1578564281.0,"There's a website that has tips on saving money at Disneyland. I think it's called mousesavers.com 
Also get the Disneyland App that shows wait times that you can book free fast passes on and get the card that the photographers hand out. I think it was around $10 USD to get the digital photos the photographers take at different park areas with characters. There's a schedule for the characters too so you can figure out where they'll be.
If there is a parade going on you should head to rides in other areas of the park. 
My sister suggests when you arrive at the park, instead of milling around main street entrance, immediately head to splash mountain or other popular rides deep in the park and get in a few rides before everyone else heads that way. 
If you want cheaper flights then you might want to head to Japan for Disneyland and DisneySea instead of California 
I saw a full on high seas pirate battle this past summer in Disneysea's Mediterranean harbor! Tokyo DisneySea is one of a kind 
Have fun!"

If you want to know for sure you can find out with a blood test that analyzes your chromosomes. If you have the test you won't have to speculate and worry yourself. Having an extra X chromosome is manageable. I hope you take the test and get the result you want but if the result isn't what you want there is a community here that is supportive and can answer questions you might have."
