ukpolitics,feex8l2,t1_feeqkid,1579043195.0,"I am not Bojo mate, I’m a remainer. I’m not making any threats. 

SNP literally want their cake and eat it too. Scotland voted to be part of the UK being fully aware of the anti EU sentiment and now SNP is using it to try and get another ref even though this would be the worst time to leave and the public would likely vote that way. No one knows what it would look like if Scotland crashed out of the UK and the EU in one go. I would bet the SNP did this just Bojo could say no because this is the worst time to throw Scotland into more chaos than brexit.

The goal here is to build the sentiment of Westminster doesn’t listen to us so that when the dust settles and everything is shit, they can get an indyref2 after the next election and win a landslide. 

At this point, there is no reason for the EU care more for an “abused” Scotland than the 50 million plus in the rest of the UK they’re busy trying to make a deal."
ukpolitics,feeojy5,t1_feeob9g,1579037943.0,You have to be really naive to believe that. Obviously we’d all be better just staying in the EU. All I’m saying is an indyref2 is probably something that would be worse for Scotland right now. This is the best thing that could happen because when brexit is a failure the SNP will comfortably win an indyref2 and then start talking to an EU who’s done with Britain
ukpolitics,feeo6qu,t1_feenkoo,1579037730.0,"It matters because the pretence of indyref2 is the UK leaving EU but the fact remains that Scotland won’t automatically join the EU if the vote succeeds and before they do they will have to try and negotiate their own deals with the UK while it’s negotiating with the EU. If the Scottish feel neglected now, it will be worse if they try to leave the UK without some deal"
ukpolitics,feenegl,t1_feemrym,1579037273.0,"Neither does London or NI. Either way indyref2 doesn’t get Scotland into the EU, it just creates another transition and exit from a union that has to be negotiated while negotiating brexit.

ukpolitics,feen5cm,t1_feem6zd,1579037129.0,"I don’t want brexit at all but nothing is achieved with another vote now in the middle of the transition, indyref2 can’t keep Scotland in the EU, and no one is admitting that"
ukpolitics,feelm77,t1_fee0az0,1579036242.0,"Yeah it’s pretty silly to underestimate Bojo considering his achievements in the last election. To me the biggest argument against indyref2 is the SNP didn’t win a Scottish majority and the UK is in a transition period with the circumstances being different again this time next year, giving the SNP the same mandate for indyref3. Regardless of who wants it, the UK, including Scotland, will be out of the eu in a couple weeks and indyref2 can’t stop that. 

Indyref2 will come but more likely after the next election because Bojo just doesn’t have to do anything about it while he’s in power"
ukpolitics,feekeh8,t1_feeht8i,1579035531.0,Yeah but it hasn’t been a success or failure yet. If there’s a vote now before the transition then it complicates the transition even more if Scotland want to leave. If Scotland vote to remain again but the new deal at the end of the year is a failure you can expect indyref3
