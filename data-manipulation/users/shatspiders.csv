AmItheAsshole,ff8e6m5,t3_es81h3,1579674720.0,"NAH/INFO. It's reasonable for you not to want to forfeit a $300 class. It's also reasonable for your friend to be upset that you can't make his party. Even if you explained it, he probably heard ""I'm bailing on you because I would rather to skydiving"". 

It depends on how close of a friend he is, and also how much you value his friendship. If he's your best friend you've known since you were 5, I would say this is kinda shitty. If you're not super close, it shouldn't be a big deal to not make it. 

Why don't you schedule a time close to his birthday to take him out somewhere and hang out just the two of you? Like go out to a movie or bowling or something, and make sure you let him know before that you have a previous commitment on his birthday but still value his friendship and wanted to do something special."
