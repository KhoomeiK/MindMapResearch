• HEPA vacuuming (wasn’t allowed to empty/change HEPA filters though)
•setup of worksite
•Material removal (wet cleaning), but closely supervised

Here are the rough details if you wish to compare notes of what we did.

It was a week to two weeks per house that was positive for asbestos (One room a day is what I remember). Only two houses tested positive. The contractors were rather anal about those jobs. Most houses worked on were actually empty and planned for renovation, so furniture wasn’t entirely an issue.

First we check for ACM rating, before going further. The second house job was labeled “Accidental disturbance possible or likely disturbance” first house was labeled “undisturbed”

For second house job, full dress up head to toe PPE (Think Breaking Bad superlab attire) with three decontamination chambers outside along with a trail of tarps to the truck just in case. One of them even had a shower.

Two layers of plastic (I think) is what we used for the walls.

After wet scrape. We washed and brushed the ceiling. By comparison, the easier job was a ceiling overlay.

After all that mess, some guy is called in to run an air quality test before we can get a thumbs up that the job is done, hence why I’m not really concerned with me at the time doing this job. 

Mentioned in my other comment, we only managed to do 4-6 houses while two needed the abatement.

Non asbestos Popcorn Ceiling cleanups was the $100 jobs (the easy one). The ones with asbestos jobs easily touched a few thousand dollars; usually $2500-$4500.

More specifically the two contractors, checked for them before approving the cleanup.

Edit: to clarify, some houses had information on the paint used for the house, and we were able to run a background on the paint used. 

The popcorn ceiling job was advertised along with whatever the job the contractors were going to do that said house. Pretty much every house we worked on said yes to the removal in addition to whatever job was initially requested.

The process became a bit easier when we learned that an entire neighborhood was built by three companies and just contacted that businesses for that information. Basically a lot were cookie cutter houses.

For most of the houses that didn’t have any paint information, we either played it safe and followed proper protection and cleanup.

Jordan kept bringing up that Asbestos commercial (the one about mesothelioma) as joke throughout the job.

The house takes about a week to do it properly, most were single floor so we only managed to complete about 4-6 houses, but a ton of rooms. 

The one i couldn’t do was this one house that had a 20 ft ceiling. Too much of a liability for a HS kid."
