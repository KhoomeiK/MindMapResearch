SeriousConversation,ffdq2f2,t3_ess8kh,1579826233.0,What's the name of the Go Kart place? Where's it located? I don't want my information stolen and used against me in this way. This is scary.
SeriousConversation,ffd1yvo,t1_ffcwjft,1579811824.0,"We all have our causes, when I have attained my goals in life, I'm going to make it a mission to prevent and expose excessive and unwarranted punishment."
SeriousConversation,ffcvkpr,t1_ffcu9kh,1579808165.0,"You are right. I haven't encountered a single person who has expressed agreement with me on this topic. Maybe I'm wrong, or maybe I'm on to something. I find many people including myself hear the things they disagree with, so even when others are compelled to argue with what I'm saying, or whether it is me who is compelled to argue with someone else, it plants a seed which may go on to later germinate. Perhaps they encounter a news story twenty years on that causes them to consider and express sympathy for a wrong-doer and make an admission that there is such a thing as excessive punishment, perhaps our human priorities expressed by our own laws are in need of reformation. It doesn't require them to make an immediate admission."
SeriousConversation,ffcse2n,t1_ffcrubw,1579806287.0,When it comes to the hypothetical scenario I devised. I am omniscient. The question is moot. There is no question.
SeriousConversation,ffcq65p,t1_ffcoq2w,1579804895.0,"How certain do you have to be of something to ""know"" something? I say I know the sun will rise tomorrow. You might say I don't know that. I say I do, because when I use the word ""know"" it doesn't mean 100.00000% certainity. it might mean 99.9999% certainty. In the case of the lady and the nurse, it was a hypothetical scenario which I devised so I think it's fair to say, from my perspective of the author, I have created a scenario in which I am omniscient, to explore the possibility of this kind of injustice as a supposition to open people's eyes to the possibility for profound injustice. Just because in the real world I am not able to say with 100% certainty as I did in this scenario. Doesn't mean we continue to justify injustices committed, no matter how plausible, because the injustice cannot be known with absolute certainty at some point people use their common sense to make judgements."
SeriousConversation,ffcp808,t1_ffcoq2w,1579804271.0,"The point of a supposition - the practice asking someone to suppose something - isn't something I regard as nonsensical, especially when the supposition isn't something out of reason or a complete implausibility. I say ""suppose this"", you say ""I refuse!"" that is the crux of this argument. We are at an impasse."
SeriousConversation,ffcdwda,t1_ffbpg93,1579797358.0,"I'm giving the example. A supposition that you can and do know the possible outcome for the sake of the argument. It's a supposition, of regarding one possible outcome. It's not so hard to imagine the likelihood of such a case, it's exceedingly plausible in the way this outcome is presented."
SeriousConversation,ffb92k6,t3_esigi9,1579755654.0,"Say a guy is playing a videogame, and some trivial offense occurs. Friendly fire is taken -10HP or something like that. He says ""You raped me! My asshole is ripped open right now. How could you?"" Why is that joke said? Was his intention to trivialize rape? No. It's meant to contrast the trivial and inconsequential nature of the event and exaggerate it to something of the utmost seriousness. You could tell the same joke. He get's shot. friendly fire in a video game. ""Dude what the fuck? You put me through the literal holocaust just now. You shot me. This is 10 times worst that the entire holocaust."" You could, I suppose, lecture the person on how bad the holocaust was and tell him that was inappropriate, how you know a friend of a family member of a friend who went through the holocaust report him to authorities, get him labeled as some antisemitic type, ruin his or her employment prospects. I just find most people in their right mind don't care about this sort of policing."
SeriousConversation,ffb3e2r,t1_ffb2ot1,1579750764.0,"I'm not sure we completely disagree, I'm in agreement with you, that rape is bad, just how bad, I think it depends on the case. Is it so bad the subject ought to be banned from joking about? We might be in disagreement there. I just feel like there's the temptation to exaggerate the wrongness for some kind of political gain. It's almost like the more you portray and punish the bad, the more a person thinks of themselves as good. I'm of the position that punishment itself is a bad thing and there is such a thing as excessive punishment, and unjust or undeserved punishment and those too deserve consideration. I could tell you stories."
SeriousConversation,ffb1bki,t1_ffazsui,1579749333.0,"Where do we draw the line? Murder is bad too, you could argue it's never okay to joke about murder. I would argue that many of these so called rape jokes aren't designed to trivialize it. It's meant to exaggerate an offense or wrong doing. If you think about it, there's a serious side to every joke, it's by it's very nature disrespectful. Comedy is the art of disrespect. I understand what you're saying, but I think if you treat a subject with excessive seriousness make it forbidden, make it unforgivable, it becomes contemptible, because it's harmful. At some point people need to be conscientious of that."
SeriousConversation,ffaybez,t3_esigi9,1579747313.0,"Dave Chappelle said the following joke best to my recollection ""There's a rapist on the loose in San Antonio, Texas. He only rapes men. So far eight men have reported being raped by this man-rapist. How many people has he really raped? *Must be in the thousands. That's shit a man would never, ever talk about. Take it to the grave!""*

Bill Burr bit called ""50 Shades of Rape"" I don't know if it's appropriate to quote it, but it was a joke about the consequences of fulfilling a woman's every last desire. She's passed out (perhaps dead) on his bed, and he explains ""I was just giving her what she wanted!"" to the cops as they move into arrest him. 

I feel like sticking up for rape jokes is not a cause I want to champion, so I feel like if you really want to combat this stuff, speak out against those people. If this is a really a subject that can never be joked about, my feeling is, such a statement will make any person with the gumption to come up with a joke about it, for the very reason that it's made forbidden."
Journaling,ffam327,t3_englah,1579739141.0,"My Daily Journal - 1/22/20

Spent the day at the library, I was designing my game Suit of Aces, doing some programming and design on the U.I. but hell, may serve to be a great deal more work, I'm trying to see how I can simply what I want to do. 

I'm taking a more comprehensive approach to the U.I. both simplifing and making the U.I. appear more lively, extra work for me, but it'll pay off, I'm sure. I'm planning this locking system for firing Missiles on the NPC's reticle. Seems like a cool way to do it. 3 components to a successful like (In Viewport) In Range and Within Relative Velocity.

There was this guy Sayher, I'll call him, he asked for a couple bucks and I decided I'd give him fifty cents of it, I told him I was only going to give him the 50 cents. instead of saying ""thank you!"", he said ""Where's the rest?"" and he's been hitting me up for money ever since, swear last three times I've bumped in to him, he's asked me for some money. followed me into a Mexican restaurant. told him I didn't have any money to give him. I wonder if he's on drugs.

I love the library, but I think I'll work from home, don't want to get mugged walking to and from the library. If I go, I'll bring something light just a tablet to read with.

Speaking of reading, I am reading ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon hill, and it talked about the importance of decision making. Decisiveness is key, when you change plans, do so slowly. I love to read self help books, so empowering. Last night I read about the decisiveness part and not letting other's opinion sway you to a course of action. Last night I decided to pull an all nighter, and work on Friendly AI, was desiging a ship called the Tripac and working the NPC AI for Friend A.I., still got to flesh a few things out. It was incredible the progress I made. I was listening to the this Focus Meditation on Spotify which was fantastic. It was explaining how to rid yourself of fears and anxieties, and I realized there were anxieties I didn't realize I had. Fear of success."

What your suggesting is like the following. I've always wanted to build a house, but I don't like engineering, or archetecture, or drawing, or building materials, I don't want to do any work. I just want to wave a magic wand and have the building I'm thinking about appear out of nowhere. I think if you did get such a wish, what would happen is building house via magic wand would not satisfy you. You'd be left with having everything except an occupation. 

You have a vision for some game or gameplay experience. You could try to sell the idea to someone, I don't mean literally, like a price, but you could throw it out there, if it's a vision or an idea of a game that is compelling and you sell the experience and the value of it, you might get other people with a passion for doing the necessary work to do it.

It seems your passion is with envisioning worlds, which is fine, but it would be more fine if you could communicate the experience in the form of writing or video, or whatever medium maybe rudimentary game design, you could communicate the dream for such a game.

Perhaps you don't trust others with your idea. I'd argue what you want is not to create the game, but money."

So I've just made 2 big changes in my life, 2020 will be the year of financial independence. I'm collecting disability and I don't want to be. I need to do one of two things.

I kick ass at that.

So the other change in my life, is that I've discovered beer. I've not been drinking any for like the last decade. Not drinking much of anything, but then I bought a beer and it agreed with me, beer and me we're getting along okay so far."
