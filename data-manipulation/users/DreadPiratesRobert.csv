But these dudes ran out of them so wore the white ones. Then they had to wear a normal brown/tan t-shirt over that, plus uniform blouse.

I highly doubt many people have seen that page. It's generally just taught you should wear garments except when swimming or working out (or sex maybe)"
insanepeoplefacebook,ffjoq4n,t1_ffjiha6,1580003169.0,"Emergency medical services are relatively new to the emergency services scene. Police are fire are both very old, and so they're seen as institutions.

Ambulances have existed for a while, but mostly they just transported, and they were mostly hospital based.

It wasn't until the 1950s that someone decided they should send out medically qualified people, and again this was done by hospitals, so they wanted to make a profit.

Since then, many county governments have decided to get involved and take over the service, either making it part of the fire department, or making a county service all by itself.

The real issue comes with it being the only service that you can profit off of. You can't really privatize police, and fire can be private, but they typically don't make money. There are thousands of patients daily who need stretcher transport but don't need emergency transport. Most every large city will have a minimum of two ambulance services, 911 and IFT (interfacility transport). Often these private services bid for county 911 contracts, ussually the county pays them, plus they get to keep most or all of what they bill."

Bluetooth has its place, so does wired. I love technology advances, but also old technology that works fine doesn't absolutely need to be replaced. They both have ups and downs."

Android,ffickon,t1_fficfbk,1579970649.0,"Absolutely. I used to use those for working out, it would last about an hour, and if was doing anything besides the row machine they cut out intermittently.

Currently I use my $8 wired ones to work out and while the cord bothers me, it's league's better than those"
