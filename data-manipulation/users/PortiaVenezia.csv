Both times, metro knew a risk assessment found that an instructed drive was recommended unanimously and both times metro ignored it and sent threatening letters to drivers who complained the video was inadequate.

As I understand it from my a friend who's a driver, the signal sighting has drastically changed and especially when there's multiple trains in the area some signals are actually visually blocked out by other trains. So one big issue is knowing the placement of these signals in case they are at stop is imperative and having video training does not provide that spatial knowledge that in person training does"
