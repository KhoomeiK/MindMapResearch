I think overall, I'm in a good place now, and had I known about Dave years ago, I probably would have gone all in. But since I have what I have, and I'm making leaps and bounds towards debt free, I think I'm gonna keep doing my own thing until I'm debt free, then pick up after BS3. 

I really like the idea of being debt free, and saving 15% towards retirement sounds like a great idea. Paying off a house early and buying things with cash (credit card in my instance for those sweet sweet rewards but then immediately paying it off)  but steps 3 - 7 I can't at all disagree with. 

I guess I'm Dave-ish. I like most of what he says, but with some caveats. I was looking at it today and I can go 100% Dave and be debt free by June. But then I'd wipe out my 6 month emergency fund, and build that back up by December. Or I could do what I'm doing and be debt free by January. But that would mean my savings is wiped out for 6 months, and that scares the shit out of me. If anything happened, if would just push my debt further. The risk doesn't seem worth the reward to me"
DaveRamsey,ffiqtai,t1_fffr4tp,1579980407.0,"So I've been doing some thinking. I just did my taxes, and I'm looking at way more than I ever had before.

I could theoretically pay that all off, leave myself $1,000 in my emergency fund, and then be debt free by June (probably faster with overtime and bonuses or whatever) then I could work on my 6 month emergency fund again by Dec 2020. 

That sounds like a no-brainer. But also wiping out that emergency fund scares the pants off me. It looks like it's going to take about the same way one way or the other. I just ran two calculations: 

A.) Wipe out my savings + Tax Return = Debt Free - June 2020/6-month Emergency Fund - Dec 2020

B.) Tax Return Only and keep my savings where it's at = Debt Free by January 2021 



I'll mull it over, but since you were in a similar situation, I figured I'd run it by you for your thoughts. I'm leaning keep my savings where it's at. Six months with no security blanket sounds terrifying"

And as others have pointed out, I never really hit that financial rock bottom. Sure, I've been poor as shit before.

Write out what you want to say in a rough draft. Even if it's word for word. Included pauses and italics for emphasis. Write it out how you want to speak. 

I cannot agree with setting a timer. Start at the beginning and time yourself. Don't worry about the grammar or the editing yet. Worry about how much information you have. Record yourself and play it back. Pay attention to where you get hung up, or something just sounds *off*. 

Once you have a good idea of what you want to say, make bullet points. You don't want to sound like a robot during your presentation. A good presenter can speak off the cuff. Maybe you just thought of something on the fly. Don't be afraid to improvise if it feels natural.

DaveRamsey,ffg73pi,t1_ffg3qkd,1579899877.0,"So after mulling this over, and reading every response, I think I figured out where my issues come from. I frickin' wish I knew about this 15 years ago. If I would have done half of this as a teen, I obviously wouldn't be in the trouble I was. But you can't change the past, so I'm left picking up the pieces. 

As for the delayed gratification, I totally get that. I pretty much only pay for things if I can afford them then. Sure, saving up for a vacation sucks. But it's better than owing on it. 

And for the lower income issue. I'm looking at it like this. If you make 30k a year, and you owe 60k, that is not at all like making 100k and owing 200k. If you make 100k, you could live like you make 30k and pay that off in Dave's average of 18-24 months. That might be worth making the sacrifice. If you make 30k, there isn't really a lot of wiggle room. Even paying $1,000/mo, which is more than half of your take home pay, would take you almost 3 years, assuming nothing else goes wrong during that time. And that's a big IF. 

My YOLO mentality isn't too bad. I know there is a time and a place for savings and retirement, and I sure as shit don't want to be working until I'm dead. (Honestly, if it was up to me, I'd never work another day if I didn't have to. But that's a different story for a different day) So I'm more than willing to put in *some* time and *some* effort now to live comfortably later.

As I got older, I heard you should take as much as your company will offer towards a 401k. They match 5% you bet I put in 5%. On top of my 10% towards saving. I recently got into personal finance a few years ago, so I've been upping that as I can. Now that my savings is at a good spot, I've completely put a stop to putting anything towards that at all, and focused all of that money towards debt instead.
