http://web.archive.org/web/20051219234553/wtc.nist.gov/pubs/NISTNCSTAR1-1.pdf (page 14/PDF page 74)

""Cantor 1985"" is referring to the drawings by Irwin Cantor. These were released by NIST via FOIA in 2012.

Both sets of drawings, by Irwin Cantor AND the ones from Frankel Steel Limited, show shear studs on girders. 

In Frankel drawing E12-13 (12 and 13th floor, NIST says the collapse initiated on the 13th floor), as written in the map key, the shear studs are represented by numbers in brackets like <...>

This drawing actually shows 3,896 shear studs, including on girders.

And there were apparently even more studs than shown on the drawings, considering the map key's reference to ""field applied"" studs, and ""FOR ADDITIONAL STUDS SEE CUST. DWG. S8 REV. 1"".

The official story is that fire did it alone, with no help from the rubble damage besides maybe starting and fanning the flames. 

Half an hour after the Twin Towers collapsed, an unidentified man warned the fire chiefs that WTC 7 would collapse ""in about five or six hours"". At this point in time, whatever fires in Seven were not large enough to be seen through the outer windows - the earliest pictures showing fire in the windows were taken 1 1/2 hours after the Twins fell. Besides the alleged case of the WTC, no modern skyscraper has collapsed for any reason besides controlled demolition. Seven fell five and a half hours after the fire chiefs were warned.

>You are disrespecting those who lost their lives and you are making a fool of yourself go back to Instagram where idiots like you belong.

False. People thought explosives were involved before the rubble of the first tower hit the ground. In fact, after the first tower collapsed, a few firefighters were debating over whether it was a controlled demolition or a natural collapse, and their conversation was cut short by the collapse of the second tower. Many of the people who died probably thought explosives were involved as well. You still have yet to prove them wrong. Getting emotions involved in your research won't help anything. I think you'd have to be a retard to not be at least a little suspicious of the WTC destruction."

The rubble damage to WTC 7 is a red herring for non-technical audiences. The OFFICIAL STORY acknowledges that the the collapse the WTC 1 North Tower caused no serious damage to WTC 7 besides (allegedly) starting the fires from falling debris.

From the National Institute of Standards and Technology's 2008 Final Report on the Collapse of World Trade Center Building 7, Page xxxvii, or page 39 of the pdf file: https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/NCSTAR/ncstar1a.pdf

>Other than initiating the fires in WTC 7, the damage from the debris from WTC 1 had little effect on initiating the collapse of WTC 7. The building withstood debris impact damage that resulted in seven exterior columns being severed and subsequently withstood fires involving typical office combustibles on several floors for almost seven hours. The debris damaged the spray-applied fire resistive material that was applied to the steel columns, girders, and beams, only in the vicinity of the structural damage from the collapse of WTC 1. This was near the west side of the south face of the building and was far removed from the buckled column that initiated the collapse. Even without the structural damage, WTC 7 would have collapsed from fires having the same characteristics as those experienced on September 11, 2001. The transfer elements such as trusses, girders, and cantilever overhangs that were used to support the office building over the Con Edison substation did not play a significant role in the collapse of WTC 7.
