niceguys,febq33v,t1_febnywy,1578961472.0,"Mate if you say you’re not attractive that means you’re ugly. I’m not saying there’s no in between, there is; it’s called average. But you said you weren’t attractive so it stands to reason that by that you would actually mean not attractive. And yeah I called you a cunt cause you are acting like a cunt, I have a reason for that. But calling me out cause I like video games? It’s just weird to be honest, not even really an insult. But whatever I know when nothing I can say could change someone’s opinion so I’m not gonna try"
niceguys,febbpjo,t1_feb7z50,1578957219.0,"“I know that since I’m not attractive that I deserve less in life” you eh... you didn’t say this? Weird, could’ve sworn you said this. And I’m not calling people cunts as in plural, I’m calling you a cunt as in singular because you are a cunt. I mean anyone that goes through someone’s profile on reddit to make fun of their likes and dislikes in order to prove a point, seems like a cunt to me"
niceguys,feb76ln,t1_feb4naq,1578956049.0,"And... what? I like video games, and I’m not ashamed about that though I don’t know why I would be. Sorry you can’t accept that people can like what they like. I feel sorry for you, I mean you’re self proclaimed as ugly, and you feel like that means you deserve less in life. But yeah I’m not gonna let a guy like that shame me about my hobbies so yeah, whatever mate"
niceguys,feb58mu,t1_fe8tbl4,1578955546.0,"I hope for your sake you get out of this mentality soon. It’s not doing you any favours. You can’t just separate folk into ugly and good looking, cause that’s not your call to make. A guy could get rejected by ten lassies in a row and you would say that’s his lot in life because he’s ugly, and then he could go get with a lassie that’s subjectively better looking than the rest and be incredibly happy with his life. You don’t just get to say that ugly people don’t get all the good stuff that nice looking people get. Honestly you just come across as self pitying and coming up with this mentality to cope with how unsuccessful you’ve been with women. But yeah go ahead and prove me wrong with “logic”"

ScottishPeopleTwitter,fduxlzb,t1_fdux1hi,1578740610.0,Yeah my point is I don’t understand why you would hear “fook” even when you know what’s being said is “fuck” I honestly don’t understand that
ScottishPeopleTwitter,fdupxmn,t1_fdu3803,1578737048.0,Then I don’t think you’ve heard enough Scottish folk. None of us say it like that and if you heard me or anyone I’ve ever known saying it you would just hear “fuck”
ScottishPeopleTwitter,fdtqqo6,t1_fdsoh2n,1578720729.0,"Mate, I hate to tell you but you’re thinking of something else. Not once have I ever heard someone saying it like that here. We all just say fuck, and it rhymes with duck"

witcher,fdge9oh,t1_fdezkn5,1578392679.0,Well in the books Renfri is stated as being almost as tall as Geralt. So with her standing straight and him with his legs spread it makes sense that she looks a bit taller

MonsterHunterWorld,fdddo68,t1_fdd8ehe,1578307366.0,"And because it got a pretty substantial buff. The damage of perfect rush combo was increased quite significantly and the shoryuken move with the claw got upgraded so that it has a massive I-frame during the uppercut, and it only takes one hit to tenderise using that move. Also in some places on the monster just grappling onto it with that move will tenderise it’s without you even needing to attack it"
