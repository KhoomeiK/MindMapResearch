politics,ffcpo7t,t3_esszpg,1579804569.0,"These protections are just socialism. What do these rivers and streams pay us for all this protection? Nothing. If they want protection then they need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and protect themselves. My tax $$ should not be wasted on these Liberal waterways.  I get my water from the tap, like a real American. Most of these rivers aren't even Christians btw."

politics,ff6ejl8,t3_erttro,1579625475.0,"Are they simply attempting to get ahead of the torrent before it spews forth? Control and manipulate the narrative.

After a few days of Republicans saying he can't be removed for abuse of power, the line is prefaced with "" as it has been stated many times"" and cut to compilation of this happening. 

After several more days the party line is updated to "" it's well established that the president cannot be etc etc"". His base will eat this shit up and ask for seconds."

politics,ff64rw2,t1_ff641w3,1579619113.0,It'll be declassified eventually. Once the exoneration audit finishes.
politics,ff63yw3,t1_ff636xl,1579618543.0,Maybe it's TOO exonerating. So much exoneration that our heads would literally explode.

politics,ff608oi,t3_ertjxm,1579615766.0,Probably means he has the most exonerating evidence.
AskReddit,ff5bra8,t1_ff309pp,1579586482.0,"Exactly. And the time spent explaining that it's a black coffee only line to everyone that doesn't realise, add in the irate customers that won't move/ want to see a manager/etc and you're just creating more work for employees."

politics,fewr6ho,t3_eqs7w6,1579418273.0,And once those studies are completed he'll need a thorough analysis of the studies to ensure that the issue has been kicked so far down the road that he never actually has to take a stance on the subject.
politics,fewpdh2,t1_few7vyc,1579417488.0,"*he's never been held accountable to the point where he thinks he can't be held accountable *

funny,femhc4a,t3_epogr2,1579255559.0,It's the slow fall that cracks me up.
nononono,felgnmk,t3_eprdsb,1579221729.0,Anyone know what the machinery is that he was working on and what caused the explosion?
NFLNoobs,feidbhm,t3_ep9g62,1579135843.0,"Do you ever feel like everything is pointless? Do you have vague but persistent feelings of dread and hopelessness? Do you wish you could just stay in bed and never get up?
