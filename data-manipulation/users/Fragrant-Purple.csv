In Finland if you get cancer all those treatments, medicine etc. costs peanuts and if you don't have income they are 100% free for you cause it's covered by social welfare, nobody goes in debt cause of medical bills.

USA spends the most money in the world for healthcare per capita with their current model yet you get a huge bill just for an ambulance ride there, last time I had to use ambulance it cost me so little I don't even remember, maybe like 10-20€? Literally less than what the gas would cost for the trip.

I've had x-rays, MRIs etc. done and I've just paid the regular ~20€ fee for going to the doctor. I don't even know how much just getting an MRI done would cost you in the US but I can imagine it's a lot.



Point being that the USA spends more money on healthcare (per capita) than any other country in the world but where is that money going? why are people going bankrupt over healthcare bills? why isn't healthcare available for everyone? my best guess is that all that money is getting pocketed by rich people who are the same people telling you that universal healthcare would be too expensive all while poor people suffer the consequences and even some middleclass people are thrown in lifetime debt cause of it."

Amd,feg5mlv,t1_feg227a,1579078035.0,"Well to begin with this whole thread doesn't make sense, you're trying to reach almost unattainable temperature goals and you're worried about the CPU's boosting behaviour which is intended to increase performance and works as intended.

If you want lower idle temps and no temp spikes you need to disable all the boost features and enable as many power saving features as possible. Or alternatively do a manual overclock.

Tbh only thing you should do is fix the fan curves to your liking and stop monitoring the temps, the sudden short term increases in temps are because the CPU sometimes receives certain tasks (even when ""idle"") and it'll boost the clocks and voltages to get whatever that thing is done ASAP. 

You just have to remember that your PC is pretty much never truly ""idle"" and the boosting behaviour of Zen2 chips are so well optimized to the point that manual OC is only worth it if the CPU is mainly used for heavy multicore work only or for some reason PBO doesn't boost clocks higher than what you can attain with manual OC (eg. golden bin chip or broken BIOS)"

overclocking,fe9op2l,t1_fe9jkqp,1578940068.0,"Are you hitting power limit? What your temps are like?

I personally just tweak them individually, after figuring out memory OC I usually start with maxing the powerlimit & a slight undervolt like 1000mv and see how high I can push the clock at that voltage while running Unigine Heaven until I start artifacting or crashing and then adjust it based on results while monitoring the clock speed I'm getting (the clock speed can go down a lot based on your temps)."

you literally even proved my point and keep repeating it lol, it's pretty slim chance that a guy who gets 40-50 bombs would contribute less to the team than a guy who has less ADR than the other guy has kills but if thinking that makes you feel good about bottoming the scoreboard every match you play then good for you"

So basically if you manually set 1.35v it won't drop the voltage when it needs to to keep it safe. 

That's why PBO+AutoOC on Zen2 works so much better for most things versus manual OC. I can have 1.37-1.4v during CSGO while if I'd manually set 1.4v to get those same clocks I get with PBO I'd break or cause degradation to the CPU in no time even if I wouldn't ever run stuff like Prime cause the CPU does those more taxing things on regular usage as well, albeit far less."

If someone has lived at your place for a long time (paying rent or not) you're practically their landlord and specific laws apply to it. Same way when you turn 18 your parents can't just kick you out without a warning they also can't force you to do jumping jacks or have curfew if you're an adult no matter whether you live with them or not.

Sure they can always give you a notice and kick you out after certain number of days but they can't force their arbritary rules on you.

You could maybe get even a bit more out of it by upping the voltage closer to 1.3v but 4.25ghz @ 1.25v isn't a bad OC at all."
Amd,fcxvosf,t1_fcxqaco,1578071203.0,"Cause any game that there is even at 100% load would still be a lighter workload compared to something like Prime95, then take in account that games don't usually tax too many cores and even when they do most of the cores don't do much and the total CPU utilization is a fraction of maximum + often you're GPU bottlenecked which limits the CPU workload even more.

Also the reported voltage isn't exactly like what manual voltage would be like, the voltages change faster than you could even see with any software and the chip can switch between cores for the same workload etc., basically lots of safety measures and other gimmicks to help the CPU boost better while being safe."

I think it's basically because all the chips reach a wall at a certain point, a badly binned chip that does 4.0-4.1ghz allcore can still reach 4.3-4.4ghz singlecore boosts and even 4.25ghz allcore in lighter loads but a chip that OC's manually to 4.3-4.4ghz allcore doesn't gain much if any extra even from optimally tuned PBO but it's pretty much specific to each chip (and motherboard and workload) so you should try it yourself."

Amd,fcjz3dh,t1_fcjs5d1,1577711235.0,"9700k overclocked with a beefy cooler is still probably the most sensible way to go if you want the absolutely highest framerate in esport games, 9900k could probably do slightly better but it also could do worse depending on silicon lottery and depending on how much more money you want to spend on cooling, also 9900k itself obviously costs more as well

however 9700k isn't that great value either considering you'd be getting 3600-like multicore performance with 2.5x the cost counting in the aftermarket cooler (over triple the cost if you count in how much more expensive a decent motherboard for Intel is) and that'd be just for maybe 25%? more FPS in games like Fortnite, CSGO etc.

also next gen ryzens will probably be tied or even beat an OC'd 9700k in gaming :P"
