Additionally, if the romans didn’t decline it seems unlikely that we would have gotten the Islamic science boom which made amazing strides in math, astronomy, medicine, etc.

Additionally, by some metrics the Roman Empire didn’t fall until the mid 1400’s with the loss of Constantinople to the Turks.

Basically history is so complicated that maybe that would’ve happened, or maybe we’d all be slaves to the ruling oligarchy of Rome!"

Can confirm it works amazingly! Especially if they don’t know they’re making the history. Seeing their faces as they realized over a year later that they were dealing with the fallout of their high level 1 shot that was run 2000 years ago was amazing!"
