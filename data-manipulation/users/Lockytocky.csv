Christianity,fd8ychl,t3_ejvi8h,1578225316.0,Personally im an athiest and I just came on here to see what it was like and this is the first post I saw ( I didnt come here looking for an argument just curiosity). I think its cool that you wanna be more like Jesus in the bible he seems like a cool guy. But ( this might piss some of you off but I dont wanna an argument right now im not in the mood im just talking to OP) dont believe something without substantial eveidence. Dont just believe it because its empowering believe it when its been proven. You can follow the teachings and be more Jesus thats cool. Sorry for the long comment
