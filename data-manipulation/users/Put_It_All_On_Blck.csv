Hero bans should always be a last resort feature for balance issues, never the first resort. However when a game grows beyond easy balancing (like dota) bans become needed.

I dont think OW is at the point of bans yet, but I think blizzard could make some changes to keep games dynamic and not teams and players relying on meta heros.

One suggestion would be reducing ultimate charge gain, either through pre-match UI 'ban' screen, or if a player or team uses a hero for a long period, then the ultimate charge gain slows, maybe even to the point of a decay, losing your ultimate until more percentage is earned. This would create the need for switching heros in a match, instead of just playing the meta all game. Or you could increase individual hero spawn times based on usage or deaths (deaths would obviously punish attackers, so it would need a counter balance)

I think theres enough wiggle room for Blizzard to change the game and break the meta.. meta. And that a hero ban should only occur when they've tried a few different ideas and they fail."

The card reader is usually in a service window, that both the pharmacist and customer can see. Surely the pharmacist would notice the extra bulk of the skimmer within a few hours, as they are always helping old people use their credit card and I'm pretty sure its mandatory to collect signatures on prescription medications. Also why would they skim from the pharmacy? There is extra cameras there, because robbing the store is far less of an issue than robbing a pharmacy or illegal distribution or killing a person due to the wrong medication. The criminal has next to zero chance of hiding his identity if he has to walk through the entire store and get to the pharmacy and out the skimmer on, etc.

The idea is simple, you get these people to a state where they can function in their own micro-society, they learn to work, to communicate, to help each other, etc. Then they are allowed to leave, if they want to, when they show they are able to function. Now to be clear, I know people with severe mental illnesses, or physical issues would not work out in this program, and that many people would find it morally wrong, but I think a lot of people just dont fit in our current society, and they end up struggling and making decisions bad for themselves and society (drug use, robbery, etc).

Tarkov is proof that a small dedicated hardworking team can achieve their dreams, and PUBG seemingly lacks that kind of work ethic and creative vision these days.

hardware,ff2c3e8,t1_ff27hqm,1579500269.0,"I dont think you need to ban included chargers, companies will stop including them because it saves them money. 

However not including chargers creates a few problems:


1. Newer devices can charge faster, so you need a newer charger to use that every few years.


2. At some point you'll run out of unused chargers, then you'll have to buy them, $10 each or whatever.

3. OEM chargers are usually good, many consumers simply buy the cheapest and that's how failures and fires occur.

4. If people are buying chargers, say from Amazon, what is the environmental impact of a shipped box, within another shipped box, with it's own plastic and manual vs including a charger in a phone box?

A possible solution might be to have two SKUs, one including a charger, one without, to prevent waste the charger version is increased by the BOM of the charger, and a bit more to facilitate the extra SKU so like +$3


On a side note I'd really like to see included headphones for smartphones removed. They range from crap to decent, but I dont need 8 pairs! And audio needs are far more personal than a charging brick. And ditch the manuals, these phones are amazing, the least they can do is display the manual text at factory startup."

Conservative,ff1s8sg,t1_ff1kveo,1579485033.0,"I agree, there should be a set age for any choices that are going to impact your life forever or get you addicted.

I think 21 is the better age, as even though 18 year olds are getting mature, I'd argue even at 21 you're still figuring out this world and yourself, so 21 is the better choice of the two.

Ignoring the college tuition debate right now, if enlistment age turned to 21, it might turn away a lot more people, as going to the military is a very valid way to get your tuition paid, so there are definitely new issues that arise from raising the enlistment age.

On a side note, I think it would be interesting middleground to offer a free 6 months to a year of college education (limited class selection, classes mostly focus on skills that 100% will be used, like business, financial planning, health, career introductions, etc), to bridge the gap from high school kid to young adult, without making people toss thousands of dollars away. The idea being that it's an optional education at no cost that aims to actually help people, and tax payers arent paying to put someone through gender studies or art, but help them understand the rules of our society  and figure out what they want to do on their own money."

Not to replicate it only as well as the untrained average eye can see, to which if you listen to the video again they say *most* people didnt see the issue but could definitely see where it would be more noticeable, so it was in fact there to a degree without a camera. 

Obviously there is a place for this monitor, that's not the debate, the debate is if Apple suggesting this is a replacement for top end reference displays is fair, in which case it really depends. 30k x Y employees for a reference monitor seems like a lot, but if you're an actual big studio, its chump change. If you're a youtuber or freelancer, 5k is far more reasonable of a purchase, and the drawbacks it has arent really going to be criticized in the final product.

To me this is Retina all over again. In which Apple suggested their product was better than it actually was, Retina is fine, but it wasnt pixelation free. Just like this monitor is great, but still isnt on par with a 30k reference monitor."

Searches by partial name arent counted, unless during your query you click to confirm, like a 'Bernie' search isnt counted for 'Bernie Sanders' unless confirmed.

Its google TRENDS, not google statistics, it's all based on search times and comparisons. 

It doesnt say why people are searching, like if Biden broke his hip tomorrow, the 30 day trend would have Biden searches blow every other candidate out of the water. One big day spike will overshadow every other day.

Also who is really doing these searches? Who really googles ""Bernie Sanders"" exactly?

Since it is TRENDS, google could literally be showing a fight for 5% of voters, while the other 95% already know who they want to win."
