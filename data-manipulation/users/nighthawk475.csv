But to correct your example, if you tether 3 in the old talent the first will take 90% bonus (190% total), the second 120% (220%) the third 150% (250% total)

LETS BE CLEAR HERE  


There is never, ever, a case where the changed version of this ability does more damage than the previous version.  


I'm not exaggerating, I'm not assuming the player is competent, even in the worst case scenario where the player actively tries to find a single case where this change could even possibly still do the same amount of damage, it will instead do less damage than before, every single time.   


No matter how many targets you link to, this change will do 30% bonus damage for each one after the first, and the pre-change version did 30% for each one, including the first (and also had the option to increase it further on single target characters, but even without this, it's always guaranteed to be already 30% more damage, because it counted the first enemy linked)

heroesofthestorm,ffdc5xj,t1_ffcygo6,1579817752.0,"it's not a buff to teamfight damage, and please don't spread that it is any kind of trade off.

If you hit three targets with the pull, and then a Q, you already had the 150% damage bonus, instead of the 60% this change will give you. If you attach all five targets, it already was at 150%, now it will only be 120%.

The pull attach itself counted as a proc on each attached hero (so attaching 3 people already gave you 3 of the 5 damage instance stacks) before. It was extremely easy already to get the 150% damage increase in a teamfight on accident.

It's a nerf to the skill ceiling, and not a buff to the skill floor, because between two equally bad players, the one on the new patch will still do worse, even if they weren't actively trying to make use of the old talent.

In other words,

  
BEFORE: you got +30% damage for \*every\* attached hero, and could increase it further by dealing extra damage to them if you didn't already attach 5.

  
NOW: You get +30% damage for ever attached hero \*after the first\*, and cannot increase it further.

LifeProTips,ff79te2,t1_ff5lyz2,1579644097.0,"> Q3. Are emotional support, therapy, comfort, or companion animals considered service animals under the ADA?

> A. No.  These terms are used to describe animals that provide comfort just by being with a person.  Because they have not been trained to perform a specific job or task, they do not qualify as service animals under the ADA.  However, some State or local governments have laws that allow people to take emotional support animals into public places.  You may check with your State and local government agencies to find out about these laws.

From [the ADA's website](https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html), my work requires I'm familiar with these. Though you are correct that there isn't any licensing program, I misremembered this. I always thought there was, only that places weren't allowed to ask for it as a requirement to let service animals in. In practice/experience though nearly all service animals will have paperwork still, the owners just aren't required to carry it with them nor to show it, and it's not official. Apologies on that mistake.

But I do know the difference between the two. I'm also well aware that many owners misuse the terms and call their service animals ""therapy animals"" by mistake, not knowing the legal difference. Which is why places shouldn't turn people away for saying the wrong name."

Also, I just realised this as well:

> (New-Old)/Old = Change  

(the formula I used)

Can be distributed out as:

> New/Old - Old/Old = Change

Which cancels out to what you just mentioned:

> New/Old - 1 = Change

Not sure if you'd mentioned it because of this or not (I didn't realize it was what you were using earlier), but that's neat too, I've not seen that representation before."
LifeProTips,ff4h95c,t1_ff4f8yn,1579563564.0,"it is just a different from 100% always when you start at 100%, but the formula is useful because it works when you start at other values too, and it's not identical when you go backwards, so in otherwords, from 200 to 100 is what we'd normally call a 50% decrease/drop, and the formula works for that as well: (100-200)/200 = -0.5, you'll notice it also even has the correct sign to denote a decrease instead of increase.

The formula can also be used to calculate that 33% faster figure you'd mentioned, in more than one way.

Using the car example of a car going from 100 to 150, I said the time it would take would go down from 10 hours to 6 and 2/3rds hours, putting this in the formula: (6.66-10)/10=-0.33 (a decrease of 1/3rd, or 33.3%)

You can also find this in one other interesting way. If 100 and 150 are ""miles per hour"" you can invert them to 1/100 and 1/150 to get ""hours per mile"", the first was a measure of speed, the second is a measure of time. Going from 1/100 to 1/150 in the formula reveals: ( (1/150)-(1/100) )/(1/100)=-0.333... , a 33.3% drop in ""time taken"" as a result of a 50% increase in velocity.

There's a looot of ways you can achieve the same answer, and to an extent the numbers you used are also correct, just mislabeled. But this is also a great example of how numbers can be twisted without being wrong. If you have a drug that saves 5 out of 1000 patients, and the competitor saves 4 out of 1000 patients, you could say it saves 25% more people, or that is saves 0.1% more patients, or that the other drug is 20% less effective. Different companies would use different figures to push what they want for, and none would be wrong."

HofellerDocuments,fdji02e,t3_el7f5f,1578471688.0,"Tl;Dr this all relates to american politics.

***The main story (shortened):***

Republics have long engaged in political (and/or arguably racial) ""Gerrymandering"", which is drawing the voting lines in order to favor themselves. One of the chief people who lead the party nation wide in the science to maximize their efforts in this regard was Thomas Hofeller. Hofeller also was involved in (if not directly as a party, in an advisory capacity to help the defendants) various lawsuits over the legality of these redistricting efforts.

The primary legal issue is that redistricting based on race is illegal, and can be undone by courts. Hofeller found ways to ""claim"" redistricting was being done by other categories instead (often ""proxy statuses"", which are closely associated with race, but legal to redistrict by, such as school performance or income)

Thomas Hofeller died in August of 2018, his estranged daughter gained possession of his computers and documents, and turned them over immediately to the prosecutors and other interested parties (organizations suing over the redistricting) to help them with their cases. There was a looot of information in here, including documentation of those ""proxy statuses"" they used to disguise the fact they were redistricting partly based on race in many states. Also documents that show pre-meditated and carefully crafted lies to previous courts about their intentions and about who was designing maps and how it was done.

&#x200B;

***Further relation to recent events:***

Hofeller even ties into the census question case from a couple months ago where the whitehouse tried to add a citizenship question to the next census. It was revealed in Hofeller's documents that he and his circle came up with this idea to give them more accurate data for gerrymandering (it would cause areas of high minority populations to be undercounted, which meant you could pack more of them in a single district to minimize how many districts they could win). But to avoid detection, the GOP heads leading this effort got the whitehouse/staff to publicly request the citizenship question and disguise it as being for other reasons. There are communications from these documents that partially affected court cases about the legality of that citizenship question because the provided reasons the government was stating for it were proven to be intentional lies.

I hope this gives a bit of a run down on who this guy is, where these files come from, and why they are important to discuss, regardless of your political views. If you're from outside of America though they won't have much of any relevance to you. 

I recognize this summary of mine isn't  perfect, and the actual events have more nuance than I've taken the time to write out (including the fact that the other side/party gerrymanders in some states too). I strongly suggest doing some of your own research and also listening to NPR as a great news source without much/any bias.  NPR is predominantly what kept me informed as more and more information came out over the past year about this. That and some law podcasts that discussed the actual court cases and the various filings/decisions.  I generally just put it on for an hour or two while I drive, not even every day."

leagueoflegends,fd6bkcv,t1_fd5rns6,1578188467.0,"Thanks, iirc it was the same year Blizzard totally fucked over all of their professional HotS players too. 

While I'm in a ranting mood I'll recount the issues with that as well:

Various pros anounced throughout november/december that they were not receiving information about the upcoming competitive season. Blizzard ended up announcing the cancellation of the competition around/after christmas (I think early January). Many of the pros and casters were upset because they were held hostage for over a month uncertain of whether they'd even have a job still after the holidays ended. 

And to top it off, Blizzard most certainly knew ahead of time they were going to cancel, and a big part of the reason the announcement was delayed was because thanksgiving time is when they do a big ingame sale on the ""stim pack"" (sort of like an ip/xp boost in LoL). Many people would by a year-long boost when it went on sale. They held off warning players of the upcoming cuts to the game until after they'd spent money on another year of subscriptions.  

And now I also get to hate on Blizzard for their handling of the hearthstone/hongkong scene, and for giving one of the greatest non-apology apology speeches out there. 

That said, I have mad respect for the devs who work there anyway. The few devs who do actively work on HotS still are awesome people doing awesome work, and while I don't care much for diablo I'm sure the staff working on it is wonderful, and the presenter at BlizzCon was in an unwinnable situation before he even got on stage in front of that crowd. It's a management issue. I suspect partly from pressure by Tencent (who, though they don't have a majority share, still put pressure on upper management to increase profits constantly)."
leagueoflegends,fd5pjsj,t1_fd3tqai,1578180011.0,"There was a lot of things compounding the immortals problem. It wasn't just that a PC dev dared to make a mobile game, that honestly sounds fine, and is why I have no issue with TFT mobile.

They hyped up the Diablo announcement beforehand, people expected news about D4 or at least a big D3 update. Their biggest fans paid serious money to come to BlizzCon with hopes of being there for something awesome. And instead they got a mobile game announcement with zero news about the future of the main games. 

Then to make matters worse, the game wasn't being made by blizzard, and wasn't even being uniquely made for the Diablo IP, and was just a reskin of an existing money-grabbing game of the worst genre.

The tone-deaf ""do you guys not have phones?"" comment certainly didn't help too.

If riot did their 10 year anniversary stream by leaking ahead of time ""we've got big news coming up about the future of League"" and then they just announced they were hiring the devs of AutoChess (the stand alone autobattler from DAC'S devs) to reskin their game with league champions, and then said absolutely nothing else on stream about League at all, I'd be fucking pissed at riot too. (And it still wouldn't have even been a gocha game)

The opportunity cost is more impactful for a child since it's unlikely they'll ever get to make such a choice again any time soon.

That said, when I got my first console I was young enough and uninformed enough to not know or care about its competitors. My first several consoles were years old on the market before I'd gotten them, and I never knew or cared. I think the same would be true for most kids playing games, though I think now that online play is standard it's more likely for kids to be talking about and comparing consoles.

It's all still truly coded as minions (or the parent class of them), riot just put exceptions in to prevent the 'minions' made by those spells from interacting with eachother in ways we can see.

My favorite example was with irelia. After her rework there was a bug where her E would create and destroy a bunch of minions to register it's hit box or something. They were unintentionally giving her Doran's ring procs, refunding mana for each of the 'minions', such that her level 1 E only costed like 8 mana after refunds.

It was bug fixed within a patch, but it took many patches for the more subtle effect to be noticed and fixed. > her E was still resetting her passive stack time / giving stacks when cast even if it hit nothing (normally you only get stacks for hitting an enemy with a spell). The minions it killed were counting for passive

Riot didn't make her E not count as minions when they fixed the first issue, as was evident by the second issue. They just added special cases to make those 'minions' not proc those effects either"
