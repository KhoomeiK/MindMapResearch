StarWarsBattlefront,ff9dpkd,t1_ff96v46,1579710768.0,"a Force Unleashed show would be awesome, but it will never happen because of Disney. If it did happen, they wouldn't be able to do it justice because Disney is too soft to have mature content."
Metalcore,ff3ih49,t1_ff3i1x4,1579541743.0,Ah right. I don't have the whole album saved so I must've missed the one. Garret tweeted they were releasing a new song soon so thought this might've been it. Hoping you're good though and find healthy ways to deal with that grief
Metalcore,ff3hqej,t3_era9qa,1579541286.0,Is this the new song? Don't have my earphones on me rn so can't listen. Also is this from a new album coming out sometime or is it a single?

MadeMeSmile,fezh262,t1_feltomc,1579457256.0,I live in Australia but where I am hasn't been affected by the fires at all and it pisses down with rain regularly. So it's almost more bizarre for me that there's people in my own country that are this excited about rain because they haven't had any in their area for so long

netflixwitcher,fec1k39,t1_fea8x69,1578965303.0,"Was going to upvote this until I read the part about the dryads. Still, I completely agree with you about the elves. The story with Torque and and the elves was one my favourite parts of The Last Wish, but it was my least favourite part of the show."

australia,fd9ljf6,t1_fd9k3at,1578234963.0,"Yea that's her. I could be wrong but I don't think the whole family disowning her thing had to do with this particular event, she's a sex worker not just some rando chick who started sending nudes to strangers who donated lmao. But yea, she's apparently started her own organisation and stuff now because of how this blew up."
netflixwitcher,fd9js0c,t1_fd9i8ph,1578234328.0,"Good good. So essentially The Last Wish has the stuff about Blaviken and Renfri, Torque (the goat-man), the banquette in Cintra with Pavetta and Duny (hedgehog-man), the Striga (the cursed girl monster thing), Yennefer and the djinn and probably a few other things I'm forgetting. I'm yet to finish Sword of Destiny but so far it's covered the golden dragon and I imagine it will have stuff about Ciri. But both The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny have stories in them that weren't covered in the first season and I have no idea if they will eventually but I don't think so. So I'd say you're reasonably safe reading them but I can't say with 100% certainty. I highly recommend doing it anyway cause I'm thoroughly enjoying them!"
