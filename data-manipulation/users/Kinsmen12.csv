I don’t want to pile on you but girl, strangers on the internet (who have no reason to care about you in all honesty) are more supportive and caring than your partner. Your partner who is suppose to put you first in every situation, every day, ESPECIALLY on a day like today. Not only that but he seems at best manipulative and at worst emotionally abusive.
