Almost all insurance has that. Your car insurance has a max pay out so does your house.

Your premiums bring in only so much money over your lifetime and while that risk is spread over a pool of people if they allowed unlimited payouts a handful of outliers could destroy the company.

That’s the problem with insurance being a business. For the company to survive it has to make money. Even the most theoretically benevolent insurance provider has to cap spending someway or they go bankrupt and no one has insurance.
