But one of her stated issues was with using singular they, which is one of the best ways to avoid using gendered language and the preferred pronoun of non-binary people.  

>As for the slander, these are the ones I could find quickly:

Yeah, that first link is definitely not super professional. 

I found your second link already, it's where I found Monica's statement that I linked in my other comment.

>But their CTO admits

I quoted this quote in my other comment. I also agree with the quote and that Stack overflow handled the whole thing poorly. 

The truth isn't ""hateful transphobe cast out by righteous organization, which was then subject to angry mob."" It also isn't ""innocent moderator punished for commiting thought time, company punished by righteous voice of the people."" It's somewhere in between. 

I found [this timeline](https://cellio.dreamwidth.org/2019/10/05/stack-overflow-fiasco-timeline.html) written by Monica which I feel helps clear some things up.  

>The policy is an update to the Code of Conduct that requires us to use people's preferred pronouns (when known).

That's not exactly the point of contention, but it's a quote [from here](https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5193/stack-overflow-inc-sinat-chinam-and-the-goat-for-azazel/5197#5197) and I feel it's an important distinction. 

In the timeline post, she says 

>I'm offended when someone edits my posts badly to solve a gender-neutrality problem. (Editing well is fine, which usually means pluralizing or using a name or something like that instead of either generic ""he"" or singular ""they"".) Some people said not using preferred pronouns invalidates the person; I said for me it's not about the person at all but the quality of my own writing

The problem isn't when you write a post with generic pronouns (or even male or female pronouns). It's when the person you're referring to in your post says ""hey, I'd rather you use x pronouns,"" and you come back and say ""no, I'm gonna keep writing non-gendered language even though you specifically requested it."" I don't think that's quite how Monica intended to come off (especially because she seems supportive of trans people generally), but she makes multiple posts in a similar vein. I agree with her that 95% of the time you can write around the problem, but when you're taking a lot of time to just avoid using the person's pronouns (again, when they're known!) that's not a great look. Especially as a moderator and frequent contributor who has some authority, where that can make others feel like their voice is officially not being heard. It's like how being ""race blind"" isn't a necessarily a good thing.

And then, instead of being like ""hey, I feel strongly about the quality of my writing (which she should, she's good), but I'll try and take your concerns into consideration,"" she digs in on the not needing singular they thing. In the background some other people (real assholes) are doing some hateful stuff on the moderator boards. From [another mod's post](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334750/an-update-on-my-resignation-notice):

>TL was already embroiled in discussing the legitimacy of trans people, by proxy of a pronoun issue.

 And then:

>Monica did make a post that I still sincerely believe reflected a misconception about queer justice,

So given the climate of the teacher lounge, stackoverflow's poor communication and Monica's statements, I could see how stackoverflow would come to the conclusion that she was contributing to a transphobic atmosphere which would be a breach of the current terms of service (without the specificity about pronouns). With what we know now about Monica's intent and who was actually spreading hateful stuff on the lounge/mod chats I'd say stackoverflow definitely overreacted. But they weren't persecuting her for future possible actions, and while they revealed too much about in-progress stuff, they were saying what they believed to be true according to the evidence they had at hand. I do think some of what Monica said went somewhat beyond asking for clarification (although much of her communication was, literally, asking for clarification).

Another snippet from the other mod who resigned:

>the post she wrote does not in my eyes warrant vilification. From what I've read, I believe Monica understands this pain now, and I see no reason to believe it was her intent to cause pain. We live, we share, we learn.

I do think Monica is not a terrible person, after reading. It's frustrating that she links to people who bring up non-sequitors like religious expression and believe that using the correct pronouns (at all, ever) is a matter of personal opinion. Her inflexibility on the subject of writing pronouns is also frustrating. She shouldn't have been quite so quickly or publicly raked over the coals though."

Obviously accidental misgendering of non-passing trans people is gonna happen, but it's a whole different thing if you're not gonna put in any effort. 

>mentally ill opportunists

This is literally blaming trans people for the shitty things cis people do. Please stop. Also, trans people are just like cis people: some are good, some are assholes. That doesn't mean you need to punish the others for what the jerks do. 

>his (sorry, her)

Making correct gendering continent on whether or not you like somebody is a terrible precedent. Especially since many trans people can't pass, no matter what they do. Heck, even cis people don't always pass. Cis women get kicked out of bathrooms with some regularity because people think they're trans.

>don't feel like LGBT is a useful designation

It's true that different LGBTQ people have different struggles. I've heard trans people argue that the communities might be better ungrouped also. 

However, we do have many similar experiences, like coming out. And there's substantial overlap between trans and LGB or Q people. Also by pooling resources it makes fighting bigotry and gaining rights easier. And ""drop the t"" is commonly used by transphobes to divide us and fuel hatred when we should be focusing on what brings people together.

>controversial

Not in the medical profession

>gender reassignment

That's only one possible medical treatment to alleviate gender dysphoria. It's not even the most common. Some trans people don't seek any medical intervention. 

>often does nothing

Not true. And studies suggest most people who don't improve with gender affirmation (medical and social included) are having issues because of lack of support from society or friends and family, not because the affirmation is the wrong thing to do."

And another, which I partially quoted in my reply:

>Cellio raised concerns that the Q&A site's revised Code of Conduct would require people to use other people's preferred gender pronouns

And what stackexchange says:

>after being asked to change their behavior multiple times

I'm okay with people asking questions in good faith. I don't think Monica is necessarily a bad person from the information given and my limited knowledge of the situation. But there aren't really ""multiple ways to avoid misgendering."" There's just one: call the person by the pronouns they ask to be called. And if somebody stands their ground on being wrong about something, that can definitely be an issue.

But not using singular they *is* misgendering, if that's a person's pronoun. Singular they has also been around for hundreds of years for use when a person's gender is unknown or not specified, so it's not like that's a particularly strong stand from a grammatical standpoint.

So I found the [full text of her explanation](https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5193/stack-overflow-inc-sinat-chinam-and-the-goat-for-azazel). Here's another quote:

> pointed out that as a professional writer I, by training, write in a gender-neutral way specifically to avoid gender landmines, and sought clarification that this would continue to be ok. To my surprise, other moderators in the room said that not using (third-person singular) pronouns at all is misgendering. The employee never clarified, and this is one of the questions I asked in email. In my email I said clearly that I'm on board with ""use preferred pronouns when using pronouns"", but from the fact that they fired me without warning (or answering the question), I conclude that that's not the policy. I haven't seen an actual policy, though I am being accused of violating it.

Some thoughts:

* I do believe there was a communication gap between Monica and satckexchange. Stackexchange interpreted its communications to Monica as warnings, while she took them as discussion. Stackexchange should have been more clear, at a minimum. 
* I think Monica was at best not aware of how what she was saying sounded in the context of the discussion in the teacher's lounge and other communications. I haven't read through those discussions and I'm not any of the people involved so I can't comment further. I will say that moderators and popular personalities have somewhat more power, which also comes with a responsibility to stay informed and respectful. 
* A commenter on the link you sent mentioned ""be nice"" should cover misgendering. That's true, but some person is gonna be all ""that's not in the rules, freeze peach"" so I can see why they had to clarify specific rules around gender. So if she's making a big deal about having to respect nonbinary pronouns I can see how that would be construed as ""not nice"" and lead to revocation of moderator status. As a ridiculously exaggerated example, if SE was considering a specific rule against use of the n-word and somebody was using the n-word a bunch in a chat even after being asked to not, that would definitely be a problem, even though it's not yet a specific rule. 
* Also the people taking this as an opportunity to dunk on non-binary people or trans people in general make it harder to sort through what is legitimate criticism of SE (which, again, there's plenty of) and what is just bigots looking to punish a company for inclusiveness. 
* One of the posts she links backing her up mentions pronouns as a free speech issue. I'm not saying that's necessarily what she believes, and I'm not out to witch hunt by association, but that's the kind of stuff stackexchange is trying to cut down on, and they mention that in their official apology.
* I can see why stackexchange wouldn't want to air their dirty laundry or provide fuel for a lawsuit, which explains why they stayed vague about what exact violations she may have made and didn't, like, post annotated chat logs or something. Obviously that hurt stackexchange, and it's a very corporate way of handling things. They state in their apology ""She deserved the benefit of a private, comprehensive process."" And that's right. 
* Monica and Stackexchange settled out of court, and it's not clear that she actually formally filed the lawsuit (although I believe she intended to). I'm sure the negative press was also a factor. Besides, what apology would be satisfying from them? Their reputation is already>  tarnished. 
* I wasn't able to find public slander, but searching on my phone is a pain in the ass so I'd love a link if you have one. If true though that's definitely out of line.
* overall this is a complicated issue with a lot of obscuration by he-said she-said, and it's tough to sort through. I definitely see where Monica is coming from now after reading more, even if I don't agree with her position.
* Monica says she is considering  donating her remaining legal funds to the Trevor foundation, which would be pretty cool of her."
programming,feglcqq,t1_fegdjjx,1579096334.0,">Code of Conduct would require people to use other people's preferred gender pronouns

So the problem is actually that one of the moderators wants to be bigoted? Like, it's not hard to call people by their actual pronouns. People have no problem calling ships or cars or whatever female, but it's suddenly an issue when it's an actual person?

Stackexchange definitely has problems, and some of those are probably worth resigning over, like the relicensing thing. But as programmers and authoritative organizations I think there's a responsibility to be inclusive of marginalized communities. LGBTQ programmers (Alan Turing, Sophie Wilson, etc.) have made big contributions to the field, and programming has long been a place where people who don't conform can find work.

Edit: I made a more [thought out](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/eozm61/_/feguy0i) reply below. I now see the situation is more complicated.

Edit 2: after reading a bunch of stuff, I don't think Monica Cellio is A Bigot, although I do think she inadvertantly contributed to an atmosphere that made trans people feel unwelcome, and several other mods used the whole thing as a cover for their own transphobia (which wasn't her fault, but it's a thing).

rcboats,fef16om,t3_eosrv3,1579045756.0,"That's a really cool idea! 

I can think of a few reasons nobody has tried this:

* The bottom of lots of water bodies is really muddy, so you might sink in or get stuck with something that has legs. 
* Even simple crawling locomotion has a lot of moving parts, which means more to plan, buy, and break.
* I think potted (waterproofed) servos are more expensive but I'm not 100% on that. In contrast regular motors for typical ROV thrusters are pretty easy to get, and brushless motors are pretty much waterproof already.
* you can just drive an ROV down to the bottom if you want to look at the bottom, so this doesn't really add capability. And many ROVs have some kind of camera view through the tether.

I think a good compromise would be a wheeled vehicle, because then you could roll around on the bottom without too much complexity. You also wouldn't need to worry as much about buoyancy like a traditional ROV does, you could just make it heavy.

That said, a crab walker stalking around on the bottom would be totally awesome! I don't think there's any reason why it won't work, so if you're up for the challenge you should definitely try it! The fact that nobody has done it before makes it even cooler."

But when high shear rate is applied (like when punched), the starch comes out of suspension and locks together, so the liquid acts more like a solid temporarily (or at least becomes much more viscous). You can and should try this at home! It's usually called oobleck and there are tons of recipes online.

Coal is going away and the mix of renewables is growing across the country, so that advantage is only growing. An ICE engine never gets cleaner (often slightly worse), but an electric car can use greener electricity sources as the grid changes during its lifetime. 

Another commenter brought up air pollution, and that's especially relevant to small diesel engines like the one in the post.

But that definitely led to lots of (mostly offscreen) suffering on Earth, so the more humane thing probably would have been to fix the planet. That would have been a pretty boring movie, though. 

Escaping a black hole  is impossible for 3 spatial dimensional beings, but the ""aliens"" are stated to be five dimensional with either the ability to move through time or multiple time dimensions. That opens up a lot of possibilities for evading or manipulating a 3d black hole. I'll agree it's a lil' bit handwavey that Cooper makes it out of the black hole, but it's not inconsistent with the abilities of the aliens.

Surviving entering a black hole is definitely plausible, especially for a big black hole like Gargantua. The tidal forces are relatively weak when the event horizon is so far from the singularity. The accretion disk poses a danger but Cooper at least has a spaceship to somewhat protect him. Assuming there's no firewall that scrambles or fries everything at the event horizon, somebody will actually fall through the event horizon in finite time (although that's not what an observer from outside will see). Getting out probably involves fucking with time anyway, so the aliens probably fudged a little to get him to a time that makes sense (many decades in the future) rather that what the outside observers saw as he entered the black hole. 

Obviously there's no evidence for black hole bookcases or 5d aliens, but I feel like the movie does a reasonable job of trying to remain internally consistent while being interesting to watch and maintaining the theme and message. I'm not saying you have to share my opinion."

In a rotating black hole there are hypothesized to be some stable orbits around the singularity where objects could be stored without falling all the way in. 

But yeah, everything after he enters the black hole is definitely sci-fi."

If your system has switches to cross over between the tracks or it is more separated from vehicle traffic this is obviously less of a problem.

> old growth pockets

That's definitely a thing in more fire-prone areas. Partially due to luck and partially due to small-scale variations in topography and climate, there are some tree stands that get really old, and they're an important source of biodiversity for post-fire recovery.

Overall, however, I think you'd be surprised at how much old growth forest there was. Most of western Washington was covered in it before logging started.

Seattle,fcwnu3h,t1_fcwe2ye,1578031022.0,">Becuase we don't let natural burns happen anymore

Forest practice has changed since the days of ""no fires anywhere, ever,"" so that's no longer the case. [Prescribed burns have been pretty common starting in the 60s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_wildfire_suppression_in_the_United_States). However, many forests are still recovering from poor management and haven't returned to the natural burn cycle. There is also fire suppression to protect housing developments that have encroached on forest lands. This is part of California's problem, although I've heard their fire management practices are not as progressive as other states which doesn't help either.

Also, some forests naturally burn more or less than others. Many species of tree use occasional burns to propagate and maintain undergrowth, but there are also quite a few that don't ever like to be burned. You can't make a generalization like that, especially in a state as diverse climatologically as Washington is.

> Forests have to be managed

Why are there old growth forests at all if this is the case? The PNW definitely has always had really old trees, and many of our forests are out of whack *because* we logged all the old growth. That's not to say there's not a place for managed forests and timberland, but those aren't necessarily an example of a healthy forest ecosystem. 

> control burns

I will note that there are parts of the US where[ indigenous people used fire to manage forest ecosystems,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_use_of_fire_in_ecosystems) or at least contributed to a higher rate of fires than would occur naturally. So there's a long history of human involvement in the forest, although harvesting and planting of trees was not done at anywhere near the scale of modern working forests. I'm not sure how common this was in Washington. There's also disagreement on how much this makes sense for modern ecosystems that have started to revert back to less fire-resistant vegetation, or how much of an effect it actually had. 

I guess my point is the truth lies somewhere between ""forests need heavy intervention"" and ""forests should be left completely alone."""
