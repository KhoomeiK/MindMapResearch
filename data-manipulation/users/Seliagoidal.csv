We have thousands of years of recorded history from many different cultures, and most of them include some spiritual tradition that attempts to answer the same fundamental questions. They vary pretty widely in teaching and practice, but they all include the fact that people keep wondering about where we came from, why we're here, what happens when we die, and how to explain various experiences with what would seem to be unseen entities or supernatural occurrences. Many of those experiences have common elements across many different cultures.

Sleep paralysis is a pretty good example of this. I know people personally who have experienced sleep paralysis along with a sense of a sentient, malevolent presence. Just a hallucination? Maybe. But several traditions call this relatively common occurrence a [demonic attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_hag). Who's right? We can't empirically know.

Christian,ffrx9mk,t3_euw10h,1580167965.0,"You will never have enough time to read and understand everything about God. God has given us the Bible as a help to us in this age, but many of those heroes of faith we read about *in* the Bible never had the Bible at all.

Because God loves you. I mean, He *loves you*. Seek, and you *will* find. It may take a while. Can you trust that God loves you dearly, even if you can't understand why your life has to be the way it is? Can you love Him in return, with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength? Can you believe that even when you fail at doing that, He keeps right on loving you and drawing you to Himself?

When you mess up, when you don't live in the power and freedom Christ has already given you, it isn't that God doesn't hear you, or that God hides from you. It's that sin dulls your spirit, makes it hard for you to see and hear God. Adam and Eve hid in shame from God in the Garden after their sin. God came to walk with them anyway.

I don't doubt it, but it seems clear that if she were as fixated on you as you are on her, there wouldn't be a problem. Or at least, there would be a different problem.

Have you ever heard the term *limerence*? It sounds like what you're experiencing. Google it up - there's quite a bit out there on the topic, and many others in similar situations. 

I know it's hard, and I'm sympathetic. But I wouldn't be doing you any favors if I told you that, after 40 years of living, I'd ever found that the holes in my heart could be filled by an idealized relationship with another person. The thing is... even if you could snap your fingers and have exactly the relationship you want *today*, you (and she) will both be changing in the years ahead. Your relationship would change along with you, and your felt needs would change.

That's perfectly normal for human relationships, and doesn't have to be a bad thing - rather, it can be an opportunity for deeper love and growth. But you *must* find your capacity to love and be content and at peace within yourself, or from an attachment to something absolutely reliable and constant. For me, that comes from a mindfulness of the unchanging love of God for me, as exemplified in Jesus Christ. I believe that to be truth (or I wouldn't believe it), but I'm not trying to sell you on my religion. I only mention it as an example of what I mean by a reliable, constant source of identity.

You're at a critical time in your life. At the very least, you need to be developing a basis for your self-image that isn't codependent on another person or how they relate to you.

I can also tell you from personal experience that if you do ""loving"" things while holding a need or expectation that you'll get something in return, people pick up on that. It makes them sub-consciously nervous, wondering what you really want from the relationship and whether it's more than they're interested in giving.

I get the strong feelings thing, I really do. I've been there, and I promise you this: the healthy way forward for you is to develop emotional independence from this person. Seek healing elsewhere, and get your needs settled within yourself. *Then* you'll see her, and the situation, more clearly, and you'll be empowered to truly be a better friend. Because you'll be able to offer your love without concern for the outcome."

Getting someone to accept the label ""rapist,"" even if it's accurate, is going to be tough. If you want to save the marriage and family, I'd choose your language carefully. You're not trying to cater to your wife by being careful, you're trying to ensure the highest probability of the outcome *you* want. A therapist might help here. Be clear with them (and with yourself) about what your own goals are.

If your wife can't engage with any of that, even with the assurance that you're looking for healing and not a reason to split, well... that's useful information. If she pushes back hard or ridicules your feelings... that's more useful information.

It's entirely possible for someone to do something awful that didn't seem awful at the time. And it should be possible for that person to redeem themselves (although *you* don't have any obligation to be the vehicle for that). If she's been a good mom and a good partner for over a decade, that says something about her... but it's impossible to tell without knowing you both whether she's actually been *good*, or whether she just hasn't manipulated you so blatantly again.

You aren't a stupid person for marrying someone you cared about and taking good care of your child. Even if your wife is a crummy person and doesn't deserve it, your care for her reflects well on you. And you aren't a shit person at all for having an un-healed wound that hurts.

amateurradio,fdqgjr1,t1_fdq3tj8,1578666115.0,"I probably made up ""bio-attenuation,"" to be fair. What I mean by it is the absorption of RF energy by living things. For instance: the DTRs do seem to be better than average at getting through buildings, but worse at getting through a forest.

With regard to spotty performance... have you ever seen a real RF coverage map? Coverage will be continuous and strong near the transmitter, but out closer to the edge of usability you'll have an intermingled mix of hot-spots and dead-spots. As you go up in frequency, you'll have a shorter coverage radius overall (due to greater path loss), but you'll also have more transitions between hot-spots and dead-spots near the edge. 

For the DTRs, that looks like places where you have solid signal in one spot, but no copy at all two steps to your left. Two more steps and you might have signal again, etc. A lower-frequency system might not reach much farther, but the hot-spots and dead-spots along the edge will generally be larger, making the edges of coverage less susceptible to surprise drop-outs.

They really are a great little system *within their limitations*. They're 900MHz, 1-watt, frequency-hopping spread spectrum radios. They're about as secure as you can get without encryption, which you'd have to have a PLMR license for. When they work, they're great; when they don't, there's not much you can do about it. They do best indoors. Outdoors, they're highly susceptible to bio-attenuation and spotty performance.

You could operate them with an amplifier under Amateur Service rules (33cm band) but there are some specific spread-spectrum rules which make doing so legally questionable. And the technology doesn't currently support a traditional repeater.

They're basically a niche alternative to the expense and licensing hassle of commercial systems for those who only need on-site communications.

He was born under dubious circumstances, started his life on the run, grew up in a tradesman's household, probably lost his earthly father figure at a young age, became a homeless, controversial curiosity, and wound up annoying the leaders of his society so much that they perjured themselves to get Him done away with. And it worked. His life ended in the most painful, shameful way it could at that time. This is the Man you say you want to follow.

Of course God sees your hurt and pain, and He loves you desperately. He invites you to see beyond it by trust. He won't disappoint you, if you commit your way to Him.
