Art,fezucy3,t1_feyjjub,1579461767.0,"Leaving aside the boob, crotch, and torso issues that have been well mentioned in this thread, the outfit makes NO sense. I have to assume based on the way the fabric is pulling, that the orange jacket type portion snaps to the white under suit. The straps on the jacket would be pulling the jacket off of the undersuit. The way the zipper is drawn makes it look like it's one continuous zipper for both pieces of clothing, at which point why even make them separate pieces of clothing since you can't remove the jacket? Let's not even get started on what all the rivets and ventilation grommets are doing. This is just a disaster from a clothing design standpoint."

I saw it hit the floor, it didn't bounce or anything, but when I bent over to pick it up, it was just gone. I looked for the damn thing for several minutes but finally had to give up and just put another pair of shoes on him. As I'm walking out the door I see the shoe sticking out of his toy vacuum ([like this one, it was in the spot where the dustbuster went)](https://www.google.com/search?q=toy+vacuum+with+dustbuster&client=ms-android-verizon&prmd=sivn&sxsrf=ACYBGNQxUwc-nJa11rVH3cQdQWxc3E6PgA:1579444197919&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiM3u-S8I_nAhUWsZ4KHdnFAd8Q_AUoAnoECA8QAg&biw=412&bih=691&dpr=3.5#imgrc=pnM2ObE53LL8wM). He was with me the whole time so he couldn't have done it, we had no pets, and the toy was way across the apartment. I hadn't thought about this in years but now it's bugging me again."

pics,few2cgb,t1_fevix8w,1579404507.0,I was friends with a couple who split up over the 2016 election. The wife was disgusted by his antics and the husband refused to even listen to anything she said about why she disliked him. The wife realized that there were a lot of the other things he wouldn't listen to her or consider her opinions/feelings about and left. The husband was genuinely surprised that she moved out because he hadn't even listened to her telling him MANY times that she was finding a place and packing her shit. Clearly they had a bigger issues but Trump was the last straw.

MurderedByWords,feoqm6e,t1_feoh9uw,1579304061.0,"From Wikipedia:
>Though Buchanan predicted that ""history would vindicate my memory,"" historians have criticized Buchanan for his unwillingness or inability to act in the face of secession. Historical rankings consistently place Buchanan among the least successful presidents. When scholars are surveyed, he ranks at or near the bottom in terms of vision / agenda-setting, domestic leadership, foreign policy leadership, moral authority, and positive historical significance of their legacy. In several of these polls (taken prior to 2014), Buchanan is ranked as the worst president in U.S. history."

The guy would put a sweatband on his head, crank up the treadmill as high as it could go, and RUN while hanging on to the thing for dear life. It was a loud, gasping, spectacle when the guy would pound the treadmill for about 10 minutes and then just turn it off and walk out. No warm up or cool down just 10 minutes of insane running. I still wonder about that dude."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fdsspcj,t3_ems0cz,1578707445.0,"In my experience, it's often best to borrow something to wear to a funeral of someone close to you. If you are the kind of person that will be reminded of the sorrow every time you see it hanging in the closet, let alone try to wear it, you may want to just wear something you never have to see again. Especially something like a black dress or jacket that you use for job interviews, that's not what you want to be thinking about when you're trying to be confident. Of course, everyone is different, some people might feel like their loved one is with them in spirit when they wear those clothes but for me, sometime is just makes me too sad."

First off, congratulations on your new adventure, it's both terrifying and exhilarating. Lots of other people are commenting with advice for your business and general well wishes, I want to say something a little different. I think you absolutely CAN do this, running a business is hard but doable and as long as you ASK FOR HELP (knowing WHO to ask is often the biggest challenge) when you don't know something, you'll probably be fine. But I do want to say that I don't think anyone else will is that it's ok if you don't get it figured out this time. Most first businesses fail and if that happens to you don't let it crush your dream. Every successful business owner I know is on their second, third, or tenth business. You learn valuable lessons by diving in and doing it that you can't learn any other way. Do a business plan, prepare what you can, and do it. Good luck!"
