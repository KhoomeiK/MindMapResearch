If I had to choose between being white or having my own Reddit endorsed racist subreddit, I’mma pick being white every time lmao"
lastimages,ffe1e17,t1_ffdwt8d,1579834184.0,"Don’t be afraid to try new medicines if the one you’re taking isn’t working consistently enough for you. I read somewhere that people dealing with depression end up trying a few different ones before they find one they like. I’m taking Celexa right now and have been for a long time and it’s worked extremely well. 

Some doctors are even prescribing a combination of an SSRI and a DRI like Wellbutrin. So you have other options, you don’t need to just keep increasing your dosage.

OutOfTheLoop,ffbqlje,t1_ffb7us7,1579778748.0,"> people will go to whichever space they like the most

In my experience, people will go to whichever one has the most content and is the most populated. Problems with administration only happen after a subreddit has content and members. Nobody is going to make drama over a subreddit with 1,000 people that gets 2 posts a week. 

Sure, in theory you can just move subreddits. What about ones that are both niche, and too big to compete with? Like /r/guitar as an example. It has 400,000 members and nobody is going to go to /r/guitarbutbetter or anything just because there is some drama with administration because a majority of the time it doesn’t affect the people just reading the subreddit and occasionally making a post."
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffb3zsm,t1_ffb26ok,1579751200.0,"The obvious distinction isn’t relevant - the Irish were still systematically discriminated against. My point is that despite this, it would be absolutely ridiculous for me to play a victim card, despite my heritage."
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffazxfd,t1_ff9dfkd,1579748390.0,"The very minor problems of slavery and oppression which don’t exist anymore. Not to mention, white people didn’t enslave black people. They purchased them from...you guessed it! African slavers. 

Playing the victim card because your ancestors were slaves sounds just as ridiculous as me playing the victim card because my ancestors were slaves (Irish)."
OutOfTheLoop,ffay2tf,t1_ff98gz1,1579747158.0,"Honestly I think the ability to monopolize things like Discord channels or even subreddits simply because you got to it first is a moronic system.

Just because someone decided to make /r/InsertPopularSubject first they are granted full autonomy over the community that will by almost no merit of the subreddit owner, automatically populate itself with people looking to discuss their favorite hobby. 

Do I have a suggestion for an alternative system? No. But I do know that the current way things are done could be improved. Perhaps ownership should be democratically chosen."
