Neither of those guys seemed like the flaky, ghosting type.  They may have thought it was me who did that to them...!

Sounds like you just became super-present in a way hardly anybody is, so that you seem “too full-on” to most people.

offmychest,fgjon31,t3_eyrhtq,1580848334.0,"I disagree, for the same reasons you’ve outlined.

I’m really used to dealing with the underlying issues of emotional/mental abuse from a father, trauma etc.

And working through the self-abandonment that came from that, manifesting as eating disorders, low self-esteem, lack of confidence in myself, underearning, awful socialisation etc...

But when I was going through the worst of this when I was in my teens/20’s, we didn’t have transgenderism to confuse the issue and focus on changing the external body rather than dealing with the original trauma/abuse issues.

I had a close friend who was male, over 60, and really trapped by all this.  Experiencing his process made me just see the whole transgender phenomena as a massive psychological fuckup of people focusing on an external solution idea because they don’t have the emotional awareness or tools to do the internal work - which often goes back to early childhood.

That’s why I’m not a fan of the whole ‘transgender’ movement.  And not supportive of it."

So you’re saying your wife doesn’t understand you are really missing out on feeling loved, desired, physical intimacy to the point you’re needing to go elsewhere?

What’s your wife saying about it?  Does she think it’s fine never to have sex?  Has she got medical problems?  Or what?

Guess you’re looking for another married person in this situ because it sucks being single and falling for a married guy.  Nothing worse, road to misery.

You canvalso pay money to service to radio through various means but that’s only after you’ve had blogs/media coverage.

This is all why labels are still a thing - even small indie ones with a group of artists.  There’s a lot more punch-through with distribution, media etc when you’re going through even a small label with a good set of artists.

If you google ‘independent release plan’ you might get an idea of what I’m talking about.
