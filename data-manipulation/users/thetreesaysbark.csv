> Why you dislike the current EU trend

I can't be bothered to change it because I feel the majority of people are going to understand my original question."
europe,ff5e2hz,t1_ff4neyb,1579588959.0,"No offense meant, but could you reread your comment and try to explain what you mean a little better?

I understand that English may not be your first language but I genuinely want to understand why you are anti EU."
AskReddit,fez6or3,t3_equ4vm,1579454356.0,"Whilst my wife is waking up but not quite awake yet I get in to a crawl position with my head above hers, facing her. I quickly girate my head to and from hers using my arms to snap back up.

I make the noise ooga booga looga booga as I do this.

To us it looks like I get within 5cm of her face but who knows."
FoodPorn,fesnpws,t1_fes5fvg,1579367187.0,What a small minded way to look at other people

aww,fedejqf,t1_feddyin,1579009339.0,Thanks for the info! This was my general feeling but I just don't have the exp to back it up :/
aww,fedda9s,t1_fed8zrj,1579008268.0,"Well, u/SlapMuhFro 's comment didn't say bird cages would be preferable...

As someone who knows very little about birds, it does look as though these birds shouldn't be near eachother due to stressing eachother out or pecking. That wouldn't necessarily mean they should be on a bird cage, just a large enough enclosure for them...

However, I don't know, it could be that this is just perfectly normal behaviour and it they weren't segregating themselves based on this thing they may just segregate on something else.

I'm hoping someone more knowledgeable can make me feel better about this :)"

No offense mate, but they's a reason this music shouldn't exist..."

I did it slightly different to this with chicken thighs and one beef bone to make the broth.

And I did my own red Thai paste with just garlic, red pepper, and chilli.

I was also shopping for this on new year's day so ingredients were limited! I was missing mint so if you do it with mint let me know how it tastes!

P.s. looks like I've called it pho erroneously but I think they're fairly similar"
