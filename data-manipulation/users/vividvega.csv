relationships,ffh0um6,t3_etef3t,1579920098.0,I’ve experienced this. He stops posting so girls think he’s single. Ask to see his messages. If he gets defensive RUN
bulletjournal,ffh0gun,t3_ethx71,1579919805.0,Lmao I love this!
Advice,ffgzsq6,t1_feocaee,1579919302.0,I completed it. Thank you for telling me to do it. I didn’t have anyone to ask input for and you were the only one who responded. I appreciate it a lot.

It’s made a big difference :)
