I also think there is something to ""starter"" drinks. I think people need to start with more easily palatable drinks, and work their way up to the more complex or stronger flavored drinks. For example, Guinness is probably not the drink that you want to start out with (although, ironically I did start out with it, but that was out of scarcity). Coronas or the flavoured Michelob Ultras are probably a better starter.

And that's not to say that starter drinks are bland or worse, I love Coronas and mich Ultras even though I've developed a younger for beer. Simple and easy does not mean bad. He'll, I drink bud lights and PBRs. Not my first choices, but if they're there, I won't complain."

boomershumor,femjfhq,t1_femfe02,1579258656.0,"According to the source, an increase of activity from a sedentary life style (not saying that you had a sedentary life style, I don't know you) is usually always better. Be it 2000 steps or 10000 steps. Its more it less saying that establishing a hard set rule for everyone doesn't make sense in this instance (as opposed to the sleeping for 8 hours rule, which is supported by lots of evidence). It makes some people feel like they aren't reaching a necessary goal if they can't make that number, whether because they physically can't, they don't have time, etc. If 10000 works for you, then that's good. It's not like it's a super strenuous exercise that will hurt you. It's just important to know that 10,000 isn't a hard and fast rule for everyone. 

But hey, if it gets more people exercising it can't be terrible. And like I said, it's not like a fad diet or unhealthy exercise. Most people won't hurt themselves by walking approximately 5 miles a day."

And a lot of people don't like complicated, open ended questions. They'd rather have a simple answer that is hard to argue with (assuming you accept the God premise) so it's probably not ""I want to commit atrocities if it weren't for God"" but ""I want a logical answer for an illogical issue"""
