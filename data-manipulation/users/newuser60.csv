Sometimes I'd run into a problem, type it into Google, and find someone on stack overflow that had the same problem I was having. Great. So look at the answers... Oh, just a bunch of dicks telling the OP he should try Google before asking a question. Very helpful. 

""Why Mercury?"" is a very easy question on answer with a search engine. It's also very easy to type the answer if you know it."

Jokes,ffe9z1m,t1_ffe8fg0,1579840815.0,I used to go to this Irish bar owned by an Irish expat in Korea. A Guinness always brings the feelings of being there in my 20s. Usually I'm looking to try something new but Guinness is just nostalgia in a glass and probably what I'll grab if I want something comforting. Pint of it won't get me drunk but that's not my goal these days anyway.

oddlysatisfying,ff1xsw4,t1_ff1kwal,1579488627.0,Had a girlfriend in highschool who was from Korea. All the TVs in her house had the plastic film still on the screen with a quite large triangular advertisment in the upper right corner giving some specs on the TV. We were playing old NES games and it covered up some stuff so it really bugged me. She said her dad wouldn't let them remove it because the TV wouldn't look new anymore. The TVs looked bad with years old film slowly trying to work its way off. Everything in her house had it.
UpliftingNews,ff0zwfk,t1_feztgha,1579473887.0,"My grandma was always obsessed with Sinatra. When she was in the last stages of death my cousins and I just sat in the room talking and played Sinatra for her. I don't remember how many hours the three of us sat in there but God did we hate Sinatra by the end of it. The talk singing, the lyrics... Later I told my mom I had never REALLY listened to Sinatra before and had no opinion on him, but now thought it was just terrible music.

My mom told me that one day, when my grandma was having a day where she didn't want to talk, watch TV, or do anything they just listened to Sinatra on the TV. Eventually my grandma said ""I spent my whole life in love with this man. This music is terrible. He's just talking. Why was I so obsessed with it... He's not even that attractive.""

So maybe we were actually torturing her while she was unable to speak up and tell us to turn this crap off. Guess we should have played Zeppelin instead."
facepalm,fezybkt,t1_feztx5q,1579463203.0,"Chinese food was the one that really got me. Big plate of orange chicken, another plate of chow mien, crab puffs, two cups of coke. I ordered some chicken with green bean dish and took at least half of it home with me. All the while she's telling me how little she eats. But you just have to hold your tongue. She was my first really overweight friend and I was trying to be less judgemental of people, but I was uncomfortable with clearly untrue rationalizations being fed to me.  

And like you said, the money. One meal costs the same as what I would have normally spent in a week on food."

But I ate with her several times and used to take her with me to the grocery store when she didn't have a car. I couldn't imagine eating the way she did. At least 2000 calories per meal and junk food all day. I don't think she could see it."
WTF,feyj789,t1_fexwgtt,1579446178.0,"I have a cousin with schizophrenia. Her madness started with celebrity obsession (she was arrested breaking into homes in Hollywood, insisting they were friends or relatives). Later she saw ghosts everywhere. She also started stalking my aunts, accusing them of stealing from her. Then it was Jesus and she was the only one who could save you. We have letters she wrote during all these periods that show her reality in those moments.

I could see this being the same woman, even with the shift in her focus. Especially with the bit at the end about her first kill."

AskReddit,fewf3tm,t1_feuqxlr,1579409540.0,"I had a coworker who would do this. He was about 15 years older than me which would have made him 45 at the time. He would tell me stories about his life that were actually things I had previously told him. We also hiked together and sometimes he would tell me stories about the hike as if I wasn't there. I took him on several lost trails, and had always done these trails alone before taking anyone along with me. A few weeks later he would tell me about the time he did the elevator shaft as if I wasn't leading him.  I never corrected him because I don't think there is anything to be gained from it. Whatever was going on in his brain was very similar to my grandparents as they went through dementia. His previous job might have exposed him to a lot of lead fumes or dust."

AskReddit,few8g6p,t1_feuxyga,1579406867.0,"In high school I lived on top of this steep hill on a small peninsula. A female friend and I were heading home around 1AM and we were going up one of the roads. There were no streetlights going up the hill, and all the curves were extremely blind. It was basically a dense forest until you reach the top. About half way up the hill we come around a curve and my lights shine on this man dressed in cycling gear. We didn't see a bicycle, but he was holding up a flat tire.  I just said ""what the fuck"" and my friend responded ""Do. Not. Stop.""

She had more fear built into her, and I'm glad I had her with me because I might have stopped. I'm sure he was either armed or had some friends hiding in the darkness. No one without a death wish would be riding that hill, day or night. Going up that hill later I realized right near the point we saw him was a small service turnoff that they could have hidden a car in while they set their trap."

I mean, I already knew she was big before that but whatever."

But the screw that holds the handle to the pan is always loose when I cook over there, so I've put a screwdriver in her junk drawer so I don't have to take a trip to the garage when I cook. The material the handle is made of seems to be slowly burning.

But my grandma was not happy about it. Why? Because that's the way it's done. Well, not where she's from and why is it so important that it's done that way? There is no benefit other than grandma isn't upset about some tradition she can't explain the value of."
