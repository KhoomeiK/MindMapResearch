NYKnicks,ffj3kly,t3_etm043,1579989505.0,Imagine being one of the worst teams for 3 years straight prior to last season and trading away all of the compensation for the years. Only the knicks. We already got 1 down
NYKnicks,ffj2vws,t1_ffixzu2,1579989017.0,Lmao. Maybe we can get to bottom 4 or 5 instead of 3

IAmA,ffepezp,t1_ffejauw,1579858813.0,Your right about the legality of it but in the court of public opinion it doesn't really matter. Those accused still have to face those allegations whether they're true or not. I actually do share your concern about the whole process of hackers illegally accessing personal info because if they can do it to them they can definitely do it to me but at this point it's a necessary evil with our third estate being compromised by money. I fear these hackers will suffer the same fate but with even more ammunition at their disposal. Interesting times
