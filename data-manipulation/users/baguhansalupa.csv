Most new devices such as smartphones have a way to limit the amount of power that comes into them. For example, if your smartphone normally uses 1 AMP, you can use a 2 AMP charger when you really need to without considerable risk to your device. Of course, it is recommended that you use the charger that came with the device.  


you might also find this formula useful if you are shopping around for a new charger: Wattage = Volts x amp 

for example, one of the Samsung chargers that I had was 5volts 2 amps = 10 watts."
