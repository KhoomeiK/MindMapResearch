It's the official measure of poverty in Canada and its really good."

[]This article is really good on this ropic.(https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/osteopathy-in-the-nicu-false-claims-and-false-dichotomies/). Here is what the conclusion comes to, but I recommend reading it all:

The DO curriculum in the US is now indistinguishable from that of the MD curriculum of traditional medical schools, with one glaring distinction. A vestigial, non-trivial remnant of osteopathic teaching has been retained and remains, at least for the sake of appearances, at the heart of the mission of these schools. While osteopathic schools also claim distinction by focusing on a “holistic” approach to health and on disease prevention, this is a false distinction as traditional medical schools place this approach at the core of their missions as well. Despite the one true distinction between traditional and osteopathic medical school (the focus on osteopathic manipulative therapy), a minority of DOs continues to practice OMT once they finish their training ([Johnson et al., 2001](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11500286)). My experience working with many DO students and graduates is that most do not choose this path to a medical degree because of the DO component of the training, but because of the less competitive nature of the admissions requirements."
WTF,fcekupj,t1_fcdn7a3,1577621403.0,"Yeah it's like Normal Physician = ""Physician Training"" or DO = ""Physician Training + Chiropractic-like Bullshit"". Just because DO get more training does not mean they are better and it actually means that they don't believe in actual science and should be seen as lesser."
WTF,fcejysw,t1_fcbyy69,1577621217.0,"DO are as bullshit as Chiropractors:

In the United States, the training of [osteopathic physicians](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopathic_physician) (who practice osteopathic medicine) has become substantially similar to that of regular physicians.[[15]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteopathy#cite_note-Gorski2011-15) While osteopathic manipulation is still included in the curricula of osteopathic physicians, and is promoted as a unique aspect of [DO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Osteopathic_Medicine) training, this has been described as nothing more than ""'extra' training in pseudoscientific practices""."
