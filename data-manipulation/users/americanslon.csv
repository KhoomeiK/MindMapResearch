https://www.reddit.com/r/helgalovekaty/ - 4mil followers on instagram, 
 look at the stickies at the top. That's what you get when you pay her money. That's not even her real name, how much more hoey can you get :)
This list can grow until reddit's char limit is up.

These women literally sell sex. thot ->that Hoe over there  -> Hoe -> whore -> prostitute -> I bet you know where this is going ...[hey google, define prostitute](https://www.google.com/search?q=prostitute+definition&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS837US837&oq=prostitute+def&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l7.7084j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Nothing misogynistic about facts. And you know what the crazy part is? I don't think there is anything wrong about properly regulated prostitution. I remember being in Amsterdam in my early-mid 20s (an impressionable age for a male) and being awestruck at how a civilized country can handle prostitution well. No, nothing wrong with selling sex in my opinion. What's wrong is that these girls are not honest. They present an imagine not reflective of reality, warping expectations of a whole generation of young women and men. They are doing real damage.

You want a male one in there? Dan Bilzerian. Douchecanoe who lies about his own achievements, posting photos swimming in women and opulence and forgetting to mention that any of that is only possible cause [daddy left a trust fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bilzerian). Problem is that this gift to humanity takes pictures with guns and boats, not cute puppies and for every dannyboy there is 30 instahoes. Like I said for a metaphor to work it has to be at least somewhat factual.

I also find it interesting that from the very beginning you came to the defense of ""hot girls on Instagram"", not regular women sharing their lives or teens trying to find themselves or anything like that. It seems to me you knew exactly who you want to defend. So if that's really who you are defending I guess we just disagree but please don't suggest that I equate ""random women on the internet"" with instahoes. You made that connection not me.

You know what else is exhausting? Dealing with women who can't accept that some of you are useless hoes just like some of us are liars, rapists, pervs and yes sometimes also hoes. We can all be terrible yes but facts are facts and it's OK to state them even if they don't favor your or me. If we were talking about perpetuating idiotic conservatism and racism and overall nonsense and I used ""alex jonses of the world"" metaphor would you whiteknight for men like you do for women? I hope so. And yet my answer to you would be the same.

I can do this all day. I don't really know why you are so defensive about this (actually I have an idea hehe) but sex was never the point I was trying to make. Facts don't have biases.
