If she does have a litter, and you don't plan on keeping them, definitely surrender them to a shelter, and fix your cats. I'd honestly fix the male now, as that might be triggering her a bit, and you'll need to separate them for a while anyway, to let him heal. If she's not pregnant, fix her second. I'd also recommend keeping them both inside, especially if its cold where you are."
