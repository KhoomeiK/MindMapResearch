hognosesnakes,fffxj72,t1_fffwl0j,1579893974.0,Good to know and thank you. And Yeahs I want a boy and I'd really like to start off with them as a baby. I'm guessing the more rare and youngest = most expensive. And then prices deplete as they become more common and what not?

The term “blackening”, though, doesn’t refer to the seasoning itself, but to the cooking process. Let’s discuss.

Blackening is the process of cooking fish, shrimp, or other foods that have been dipped in butter and seasoned, then seared over high heat, usually in a cast iron skillet. The combination of butter, high heat, and seasoning develops a telltale dark crust on the meat that gives blackened foods its characteristic look and flavor."
