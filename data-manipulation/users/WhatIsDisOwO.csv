EmKay,fcsvhuk,t1_fcsgk3y,1577926156.0,"Her name is Scales, and yeah shes a leopard gecko... the most superior being in existence, above a cats level - I feed her mealworms and butter worms if your wondering what I feed her too"
aww,fcrtnd3,t1_fcrp6vc,1577906465.0,"She just kicked out some of her moss, the rest of the substrate is clean... I clean her cage daily, sometimes I'm cleaning the glass, brushing the substrate, cleaning the water bowl, or cleaning some of the items in the enclosure. At the end of the week, I always take her out of her moist hide, then I clean that out too (it can sometimes have bits of shed or dead mealworms in it) and always change the paper towel in her poop corner. This cycle repeats, and at the end of each month I change her substate to a new, and fresh one. But that doesn't mean it's always dirty, like I said I brush it daily.


Also those two deleted comments were just me moving this comment up"

AskReddit,fcjm3kz,t3_ehj4qy,1577693348.0,"Moldy bread with nutella. I used to absolutely love nutella, whenever I saw some I'd just grab some bread and slap it on. So one time I ate a bread and nutella sandwich with mold on the bottom (like a lot of it, blues and greens, it was also slightly thick), and only I noticed when I was nearly finished the snack. Later I threw up, probably not because of the mold, but because of my thoughts about it. So now I dont like nutella. Plus that was many many years ago and even then I knew about how unhealthy nutella was, I just didnt care."
