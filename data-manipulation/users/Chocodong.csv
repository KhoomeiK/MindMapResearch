movies,fem71ba,t1_felwd85,1579242046.0,"Yeah, the script has Broomhilda being raped like three times.  It's a fucking savage screenplay.  I think Quentin figured out you can't have a fun romancey action film with the love interested being sexually assaulted repeatedly.  The first cut of the movie was way more violent, and after the test screenings, he realized it was too much for most audiences and toned it down some.  He keeps talking about doing an extended version for Netflix like he did with Hateful 8, and I'd love to see if he repurposes the Goggins character as he originally intended.  I know he shot all the scenes from the script, so that version could definitely work."
movies,felupp7,t1_feltlcp,1579231403.0,"Well, Tarantino obviously could too, since Smith was his first choice.  Will's reason for not doing the movie was goofy though - ""If I'm the lead, I need to kill the bad guy"".  Fuck off with that bullshit.  It's a goddamn Tarantino movie, there's three main bad guys, and Django gets to kill two of them anyway.  

Walton Goggin's character was actually the big heavy in the script, but Tarantino wanted it to be an imposing Wyatt Earp-type figure, but Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell turned it down, apparently because of the ""Schindler's List"" scene Tarantino shot but ended up cutting.  It's the most brutal thing Tarantino's written, and he couldn't get an actor with enough star power/screen presence to say yes, so he combined Walton's existing character with the heavy role, and as good as Walton was, he just didn't pack the same power.  The issues Tarantino had with casting that role actually sucked all the suspense out of the third act IMO.  The script is really worth reading, and it's superior to the film as much as I love the film.  We actually don't get to see how good a shot Django is until the climax.  In the script, Schultz shoots Candy, Candy's men descend on Django and it cuts to black, then Django is hanging upside down in the barn.  No shootout at all.  In the movie, going into the climax, we already see Django as a superhero with a gun, so we know he's going to win easily."
television,felt3f5,t1_felfg9s,1579230257.0,"""work well"" is a bit of a stretch, since it didn't work that well at all.  They rushed the second season, HBO regretted it, then took their time with the third, then the creator fucked up with Jeremy Saulnier and got him pushed off the show after shooting the first two episodes.  Pizzolatto probably wanted to do that with the season 1 director, but didn't have the juice yet, which is part of the reason we were lucky with that one.  That guy doesn't like to share the spotlight, but he needs visionary directors to pull that series off.  And that's just a detective series.  Adapting/sequelizing Watchmen is a true high wire act."

But I really don't see him nailing ""I'm curious what makes you so curious"" or the dog mauling the slave scene.  Jamie was perfect in those moments and I thought he and Leo and excellent chemistry.
