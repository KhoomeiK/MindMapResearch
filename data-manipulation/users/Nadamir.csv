I can however think of two that were less than good. Edward Norton just didn’t mesh with the Hulk, even though he’s a very good actor. Also the first Rhodey wasn’t quite right I think. It’s better with Don Cheadle.

On the perfect side, Beneficent Collaborator makes an excellent Dr Strange, very intelligent and aloof seeming, but actually a good dude.  Even if he can’t say ‘penguin’

I get that acting is, you know, acting. But I think it works best when there’s some similarities between the character and the actor. Which is why crazy deep Daniel Day Lewis method acting works.

Incidentally, Anthony Hopkins who disdains deep method acting, is fabulous as Odin: regal, but not so above it all.

The MCU (and Deadpool) are textbook examples of the importance of casting correctly.

I think it’s fair to say the franchise would not be the juggernaut it is without that solid foundation of Iron Man, and at the heart of that is the perfect fit of RDJ. Without that casting, I don’t think it would have taken off.

You have to remember, most of these superheroes were B-List at best. Most people hadn’t heard of Iron Man before his movie. And now, they rival Superman and Batman. The A-List Marvel superheroes were Spider-Man and X-Men, both of which had already had their film rights sold. Marvel took a huge risk because they had no other choice. Because they casted correctly, this is a tens of billions of dollars behemoth."

Only ‘perfect contrition’ forgives serious sin. To be ‘contrite’ you have to detest the sin, and resolve not to sin again. If your contrition comes from fear of penalties or of eternal damnation, then it’s ‘imperfect contrition’ and it doesn’t forgive serious sin.

I think some of the problem with burnout of women in tech, even in the best places is that they feel like they have to do more than the men do to prove that they belong.

I once asked a colleague why she worked through lunch and she told me that even though no-one in our company made her feel like this, she felt she had to give 120% to prove that she belonged in the field and wasn’t just a woman with an MRS degree. I’ve since started dragging her out of the office for lunch, along with making sure she knows that I value her work just as much as my male colleagues’.
