You dont get to decide that for me or anyone else. Im pretty sure you knew you were straight before you ever had sex, so why is this any different to you?

They're hard jobs, seriously. They work so hard just to pay bills and put food on the table. People need to have more empathy.

Thats the problem, my point is it shouldnt be,like people should ask individuals how they feel about it, I just dont see why doing that is a problem instead of just assuming its fine.

Its a mean, hostile, toxic place where you have to be certain types to be coddled and accepted and I felt scared and threatened a lot and felt these people were cruel and I didnt have anything against any LGBT people ever and seriously all I wanted to do was be accepted and not told to die in a fire for something I couldnt control.

I should be able to do it how I want just as you do what you want. You're all fine with public injections, thats alright, you do you. I repeat, I should be able to do it how I want and how I personally feel comfortable controlling this disease. Your attitude screams like I should do things your way only. Like there's one way to take an insulin shot and you have to take it in front of others right at a table. I dont feel comfortable doing it in public. Thats ok. Its acceptable. It seems to me you feel attacked cause I dont want to but I never once said in  any way others couldnt take their insulin in public. I never said it was wrong. You can do whatever you want, just dont make me do it or shame me for not doing it. I'll continue taking my shots how I personally want."

I have social anxiety sorry,but its just not comfortable for me doing it in front of other people. Im sure you and most other Types 1s are fine breaking out needles at the dinner table, and if you want to do that and everyone is ok,thats fine, but frankly I am not. People are different, can we respect that? Not everyone with this disease is the same nor do they have to do the same things. Sometimes I dont have access to my bedroom where I would prefer to take my shots, so the next private place is a restroom, of course it isnt ideal, but its not always an ideal scenario in life.
