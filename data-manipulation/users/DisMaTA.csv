Where I live school is an essential right that can't be taken away from children. Your parents would face prison time for that. Every summer police lingers on the airports to catch families who go on vacation before summer break starts and parents who do this pay a hefty fine. That's for a day or two denying their kids school, you had years taken. 

So, I personally look at this as a crime done to you. To joke about it is a very lighthearted way to deal with a breach of rights and they should be glad about it. And their reasoning is appaling. Essentially they're saying their parenting isn't even close to conveying morals and manners to you so they have to imprison you to keep you safe. 

BTW you can't just be a teacher here when all else fails. It's university for at least 9 semesters depending on which subject you teach. So, no, parents are definitely never qualified to do this on their own. Even teachers because at the maximum they study three or even four subjects, never all.of them. Homeschooling is an atrocity I genuinely don't understand."

> What is wrong with her?

She is noncommunicative. This is unusual behavior. Out of the norm. Aberrant. The word ""wrong"" in this context means unusual, surprising, not defective. 

>""You don't have to whisper, she is oblivious""

This is factually wrong but it is what the peraon perceived. To not react to a stimulus is perceived as not having received the stimulus. How do you find out whether a cat is deaf? You clap your hands behind it's back. If no reaction follows the cat cannot hear. To extrapolate no perception from no reaction is logical. In this case incorrect, but the reasoning itself is not faulty. 

>I mean why is the character upset in the last panel if what the people are saying is okay to say?

The character is frustrated at being perceived wrong. She most likely is upset because she knows she would be treated differently if she just spoke up. She feels trapped because she cannot speak up. She understands that nobody can connect to her because she is different and unable to make herself understood and feels excluded. 

And I am  not even saying it's okay to speak like that about someone. I'm saying it's not toxic.

Barfing like, every other day and being forced to eat the stuff and barf again next time. I never said a word about it at home. 

When my parents got wind of that my mom had to hold my dad back from physically attacking the personnel who made me eat it. After that I wasn't forced to eat it anymore.
