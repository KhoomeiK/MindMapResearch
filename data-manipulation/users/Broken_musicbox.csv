AmItheAsshole,ffp834y,t1_ffp65h5,1580088573.0,"I would give you a big hug if I could, but I hope the thought of a hug from a random internet stranger will be good enough. I know exactly how you feel. My SO and I still have these moments after the loss of his parents a year and a half ago. Every word you said is a bitter truth to how life really is."
AmItheAsshole,ffp5hp0,t1_ffp3coh,1580086742.0,"Thanks to this post, I learned now that some funerals are a quick turn around. I guess it still shocks me a bit. I don’t think I could bury my loved ones that fast. I thought a week wasn’t long enough honestly. I’m sorry for your loss. Time doesn’t really heal all wounds. It just kind of numbs them."
AmItheAsshole,ffo6yhr,t1_ffo1lhn,1580074766.0,"We buried both of my in-laws in 2018. Cancer.. less than 3 months apart. From the date of death to the funeral, we gave notice for a week out so people had time to attend. Why a week? Because that’s what the funeral home advised, and who were we to go against the experts? Our roommate’s father passed away in the middle of my in-laws passing.. *another* form of cancer. He was a Reverend in the town I grew up in and had a very wide reach of influence. The church decided to give two weeks to notify people for the funeral and held it over *two days*, Friday and Saturday. I had no idea there were so many different types of funerals until 2018. I will be happy if I never attend another one. 2018 was a soul crushing year."
AmItheAsshole,ffo456t,t1_ffnzvim,1580073940.0,"I won’t even deny that this could be the case here. I get that funerals are a complete stress overload. But the common factor is, she was late and she didn’t ask the flight attendants for help. She expected random strangers to move instead. In the end, the flight turned out fine and she made it to her destination. My interpretation from this post is that she wants to call the random passenger who said no “TA” because she refused to give up her seat. This is not okay with me. I very much think OP was TA for all of the reasons already stated. Sucks to have to attend a funeral, even more so on short notice. Doesn’t mean the world bends to you though."
AmItheAsshole,ffnz78p,t1_ffnu6nm,1580072531.0,"Unless OP specifically said she found out about the funeral *that day* and that it was also happening *that day*, then she absolutely did have time to be there early enough to *speak with a ticket agent*, but she didn’t. I’ve unfortunately attended more than a few funerals in the past few years. I get how stressful they are, but notification for the funerals were always sent out early enough to let people have time to attend(typically a week, if not longer). If OP is late, it’s not up to strangers to accommodate her. *She was late*. She didn’t ask the ticket agents for help. She expected random passengers to accommodate her."

AmItheAsshole,ffno1l1,t1_ffnl5xl,1580068383.0,"There’s a reason that they tell you to arrive 2 hours *before* your flight. This entire issue would be covered in that window of time. If you are that late where the plane is almost fully boarded, then that’s on you."
AmItheAsshole,ffncfy4,t1_ffn9onk,1580064232.0,"Exactly, my flight situation is almost exclusively Southwest and every time, I get to sigh at being stuck behind family boarding. The only saving grace(that I tell myself) is that at least I get to see where the babies are so I can move away from them. 

But yeah, regardless of check-in, If you are traveling with small children, you should be checking with the gate staff at the very *least* to see if you qualify for help."
AmItheAsshole,ffmshht,t1_ffma5q0,1580058421.0,"I read this and the entire time i was thinking to myself, “how late were you to boarding?” because I have never been on a flight that didn’t offer family boarding before all regular boarding just to avoid small children being separated from parents."

AmItheAsshole,ffmax1f,t3_eu60v8,1580051590.0,"NTA, but I have to ask. Why are you two together? This is a *major* life choice difference. If one wants kids and the other doesn’t, you are literally wasting each other’s prime years on a topic you know won’t be reconciled. Even worse, since you don’t ever want kids and are pro choice, should you become pregnant by accident, you’ll likely get an abortion and then seriously crush him. Why not avoid this pain and let him go now so you can both find someone compatible with your futures?"
AmItheAsshole,ffm4714,t3_eu1398,1580048139.0,NTA. Sounds like she’s an entitled child. No one should be in your home without one of you being there. Period. How creepy to imagine she’s just A-Okay with giving out her key and alarm code so people can just stroll into your personal sanctuary while no one is home! This unsettles me. I would want her gone too personally.
AmItheAsshole,ffm3d6x,t3_eu1g43,1580047824.0,"NTA. Their dad married your mom. They are step-siblings and there is nothing wrong with referring to them by their actual connection. Furthermore, you’ve had over ten years to bond as a family unit. It sounds like you haven’t, and at this point, you are a stone’s throw away from setting out on your own to make the most of your life’s journey. They will always be family, but you are likely as close to them as you will ever be. As long as you aren’t openly hostile to them, I think you’re fine calling them what you do. Sucks your mom feels sad about that, but there’s no reason for her to be."
AmItheAsshole,ffm1rif,t3_etyxt6,1580047192.0,"NTA. First, go to HR because this is textbook manipulation and slander. 

Second, under no circumstances should you *ever* rent to this person. There is a reason she’s had *TWO* evictions in a year. That’s insanity to me. This person will *never* pay you rent. Once more, someone who doesn’t value paying bills, won’t value the property associated with the bills either. You will finally get them evicted and the place will be damaged beyond belief and strewn with trash. 

The entitled attitude alone paints her clearly, refusing to pay the required rent and utilities when just discussing the place? And then to snap at you when you decline?! She’s a nightmare. Plain and simple. You need to cut that toxic mess from your life ASAP. Go to HR. That’s not cool."
AmItheAsshole,ffly4wt,t3_eu3heb,1580045573.0,"You hate the concept of “reverse discrimination” because it’s not real. Simply put, it’s just regular discrimination with a fancy extra word. Doesn’t matter the race, sex, age, or any other describing factor though, it’s still just regular ol’ discrimination rearing it’s ugly head. 

That being said, I’m not 100% sure if this is discrimination or not, but you are NTA for being upset by this. You did your time at shitty. Forcing you to return there for possibly *years* is an unreasonable thing to do, even if it is necessary. They should offer incentives for your assistance with helping this location instead and only offer, not force you. Assuming you aren’t manager level or higher yet, you should be allow to stay where you are and a *manager* should report to shitty until a replacement can be hired and trained until competent for this location(if you are a manager level employee, then I hate to say it but then it would be needed of you..). It should not be a specific requirement of you *just because you don’t have children in daycare*. You have obligations too and you have your own priorities in life. Your time is worth just as much as your parent coworker’s. There should also be extra compensation for the dog walker and extra commute, since you are doing your company a favor here. That favor shouldn’t cost you money, but it will until you transfer back."
AmItheAsshole,ffls725,t3_eu1dki,1580043418.0,"NTA. Unless Richard specifically mentions that it was for a *birthday gift* to Monica, I don’t think you need to feel even slightly worried about taking it back. I read how he phrased it as an ease of use item for coffee to be drank that day rather than a real gift to be kept. Though if he did gift it to her as a birthday present, then I would be pissed and feel a *little* bad for stealing it back without talking to her first. I still fully believe that you shouldn’t have had to steal it back in the first place though. Sounds like you have a roommate who doesn’t respect your boundaries, nor does he respect you enough to rectify the issue once he’s crossed them. Keep the mug in your private quarters until one of you has new living arrangements."
AmItheAsshole,ffcobxu,t3_essrci,1579803729.0,YTA. I don’t even need to read the full post to know it’s unacceptable to ask someone to *change themselves* to fit your vision of them.
AmItheAsshole,ffco3es,t3_esqoi4,1579803583.0,"NTA. Anyone who tries to make you feel bad about giving not 1, not 2, but *3* children who didn’t have families, a loving, stable home life, can screw right off to hell with their horrible views on racial politics. You are allowed to love and care for children, regardless of their skin color. Don’t ever let this racist tell you otherwise. How dare she open her mouth and try to shame you for being a saint. This post has made me angry *for you*.

AmItheAsshole,ffbajev,t1_ffapt5u,1579757507.0,"I love the idea of the photos including the foster children like you said as an extended collection. The problem that my brain immediately latched onto was, “what happens if a foster child comes and goes *before or after* the time period where the bio kids take the birthday pictures? The set will forever been missing pieces! There needs to be a contingency plan in place to get photos of these other children too in the event they aren’t present for the birthday photos. 

At any rate, I really hope OP listens to what people are saying here and finds some compassion for these kids. They need love and support. They need a family. Don’t exclude them just because you don’t share their DNA. Do what your mother would do. *Love* them. *Be* their family."
AmItheAsshole,ffal7hp,t3_esg8jn,1579738532.0,"This is a heartbreaking post. It’s basically asking “should I spend $20k to save my brothers life..”

AmItheAsshole,ff7caoi,t3_erwpm1,1579646209.0,"NTA. It sounds like they are letting their pride come before what is best for their daughter. They have an Aunt/uncle who loves them enough to spent time with her and feed her, *free of charge*.. 

Unless you are actively telling your 3 year old  niece that the food her parents buy is yucky and cheap, then I say you are absolutely wonderful for helping her *eat* tasty food for the night. Sorry her pallet is turning on her parents but i can’t help but think that’s a common thing for a three year old. I’ve heard of kids becoming picky eaters all the time.

As for the picture, I would untag and crop her out of the photo. Make it known that you like the picture of *you* and you’re not going to get rid of it, but you’ve honored her request by removing her likeness from it.

You’re a minor, it’s okay to lean on your dad for support. 

That being said, I’m curious to know the situation with your grandma. Are you two close and will this hurt her, or is she an older version of your mom? Also, are you close with the siblings you will leave behind? Have you ever talked to them before about possibly moving or will this be a complete shock? 


Either way, you need to make sure you do what is best for *you*. You cannot live for someone else. Focus on your future and try your best to forgive, but not forget the lessons you’ve been taught so far. Life moves on. One day at a time."

He’s the worst kind of *fan* there is, toxic beyond reason. He honestly gives Star Wars fans a bad name. I’m happy you saw the movie without his snide remarks throughout. I hope you genuinely liked it. If I was you, I wouldn’t see movies with him period. They are too expensive for him to be ruining them for you. Let him sit at home and complain to Netflix."

If Amanda is brand new, what right does she have to come barging into a group she doesn’t know to try to sow chaos? Not that it makes her any better if she was there longer than OP mind you. Either way, that’s seriously rude what she did."

PicsOfUnusualBirds,fde1r9h,t1_fddyw3j,1578329228.0,"I would say yes, in a morbid way. The parents will refuse to feed the cuckoo chicks because they don’t know the “password” and will abandon the nest and start over. This way, they save time and energy by not feeding a bird that isn’t theirs. They simply make a new nest and lay new eggs and try again. It’s not a fool proof system. The cuckoos are adapting to be able to guess at the password.. but still. Very clever for birds."

hittableFaces,fd2hpw2,t1_fd2ez29,1578147393.0,"I would say no, honestly. If you find someone’s face attractive, you don’t tend to want to hit them. This photo alone is one of the better looking ones I’ve seen for Justin. Him being a celebrity aside, if he was any random person walking down the street, I would just think he’s cute and go about my day not giving it a second thought. 

You dislike him *because* he’s Justin Beiber. Not because he has a hittableface(which honestly, he doesn’t). You dislike his celebrity status, his fame, his fortune, his talent or his general luck and success at a young age. Maybe you hate the fact that so many people worship him and would do terrible things just to lick his boots. Maybe you just simply hate his personality. Whatever the case, that’s fine, you’re (I assume) an adult. You do you, but this isn’t “hittablepersonalities” or “hittablepeopleijustdontlike”. This sub is supposed to be for “hittablefaces”. This ain’t it. This face is pretty."
