A CPAP operates with positive pressure (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure). You should never feel anything like negative pressure (a vacuum). I'd strongly suggest increasing your pressure.

Most cases of pressure that's set too low will result in a suffocation feeling, high AHI, waking up a lot, and removing the mask while asleep, and never feeling rested.

I couldn't sleep with a minimum pressure of anything less than 8cmO2, and I can't keep my AHI below 5 with anything less than 11cmO2.

However, sometimes things go wrong. Bugs, usually, some of which can be really tricky. Maybe stakeholders want something changed and it takes longer than expected. Perhaps the team leads think something just isn't ""working"" (doesn't fit with the world, something like that). These changes can push back the launch date. 

On top of that, the game has to be sent in for certification by whatever platform(s) you're launching on well ahead of the release date, so these changes need to be made ahead of time. This is why ""Day Zero"" patches have become popular. You send the game in for certification, and during that process the teams scramble to build a patch to fix bugs and make other changes. Then the patch gets sent in for certification, which takes less time because it's just a patch. The game launches, and there's immediately a patch for it.
