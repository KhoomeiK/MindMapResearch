I know not EVERYONE goes through these things but I've heard enough stories for me to be super turned off from pregnancy.

BF and I have had a few headbutts with the dog like this. I do most of the dog work and he complains about taking her out at night for a potty before bed. Yes, I can do it myself but for all the talk about how she's his dog he can get his ass up.

(he loves me so much he'll follow me around and even let me rub his face and hug him. he's usually not into that and only lets you pet his butt when HE wants his butt petted. Even some family members are wary of him and get stuck in the hallway because he'll take up space and growl when they try to pass. It's extra funny when he's in the bathroom at night and you get up for a night pee.)

These parents who make kids their whole life and tell them they're the most important thing just make stupid, entitled brats. Granted, this kid doesn't seem that bad right now but it's a tv show.

I’ve read that it helps if you catch your dog not barking while she’s looking outside and reward that and when she is barking to ask her to stop and redirect her attention to something else.

dogs,fergvpw,t1_fereu5s,1579353690.0,"There no way you can avoid messes in the house. You can be the most vigilant person and the pups still find a way to poo or pee somewhere and sometimes just right in front of your face. It’s just the way it is. And like I said you have AT LEAST a year of this to go through. My mom wasn’t into dogs but she was okay with getting one at this point. She warmed up to the pup really quick. So your dad might do the same. But that initial anger might not fade in a day. And unless you can take off several weeks to just deal with the pup 24/7 you’re gonna have a bad time with your dad being angry about accidents and noise and him having to do anything with the pup. Both my parents would get annoyed and upset when there were accidents and they wanted the dog. Crate training took a while because vizslas want to be attached to people and it was hell for everyone involved. I had to also take the pup out to play often because you can’t just tire them out and be done for the day, they keep recharging throughout the day and getting wild. 

Now that our dog is grown she’s perfectly fine going out and running and then being lazy the rest of the day. Sometimes it’s hard to even get her to go out because she’s so lazy. But that’s after years of every day exercise, rain or shine. But she’s also scared of fireworks and gun shots so there’s that to deal with. She doesn’t want to eat and will hide in the bathroom. Forget going off the property for a walk. And she still gets upset if anyone raises their voice , even if it’s just at the tv. 

Have more talks with your dad. Find a puppy class or a trainer to come to your house and go through things together as a family. Have him meet the puppy at the breeder’s house and talk things over. Push that non smelly dog thing. Have him talk to some other vizsla people."
dogs,fer9zev,t1_fer3vkm,1579351598.0,"Here’s the thing. Vizslas are sensitive. So if your dad will be livid and act out your dog will suffer. My dad wanted a dog but he just didn’t know what to do and would get upset if the pup didn’t listen or potty in the house. We had to have lots of talks about how he had to keep his shit together because the dog would get scared whenever he’d raise his voice or was upset in general. Which made the pup not want to be around him, which made my dad even more upset. 

I was only working part time then and made sure I was around the house taking care of the pup myself. It still took a while to get past a lot of the puppy issues like potty, being a crazy puppy in general with a lot of energy, then the teething phase when she became a land shark, and so on. I had to sign up for a puppy class and take at least one of my parents with us every week to make them understand how they should be acting (because even though I know what I’m doing and it worked they wouldn’t listen to me). Now, this is while everyone was on board to even have a dog.

Now really think about your dad. How will he react? Are you able to be around to protect the pup if your dad acts out or loses his calm? Even with a quick learning puppy you still have at least a year before you dog learns everything and becomes an adult. And a vizsla is a demanding breed. They’re sweet and smart and all but they have a lot of energy and you have to have the right approach to training unless you want to ruin your dog. Most of them don’t bounce back quick after harsh corrections. 

You’re going to do whatever you’re going to do but as a rule if everyone isn’t on board with having a puppy then you shouldn’t get a puppy. I’m really surprised that a vizsla breeder wouldn’t just give you a puppy knowing that someone in the family doesn’t want it. But I guess BYB don’t give a shit and just want your money anyway"

We’ve had success with feeding from toys. Not sure which would be good for you, you’d have to try a few out probably. At one point I fed my dog while we were out on our walk from hand. It was because we were doing some training but it got her excited to eat so it was a win for me. We change toppers for bowl feeding. Sometimes chicken, sometimes a part of what we eat (if it’s dog safe), sometimes cooked veggies sometimes frozen ones.

If you’re having doubts then you shouldn’t get another dog. The biggest red flag is that you’re planning to have a kid and already doubting your abilities to take care of the kid and your current two dogs. Kind of sounds like you’re going to toss the pets once the kid is born.

Be honest with yourselves. Are you the type to toss the pets out when your human baby comes around? Think of all the work a baby is. Think about how it’s going to be YEARS before your baby can take care  of itself and be smart enough to not mess with the dogs. Think about how much time your and your SO are willing to put into taking care of the dogs and the kid. Neither should be neglected. The dogs will still need attention and walks even when your baby has kept you up all night. The dogs will still need care and comfort even when your baby is crying and you’re both exhausted. There is also a chance that the dogs will require more training and attention when they’re around the baby. Really think about your SO and their willingness to do extra work.

Just because an opportunity comes up to get another dog doesn’t mean you should do it. Lots of people are able to care for their dogs just fine and then the baby is born and they then they don’t give a fuck about anything else, and everyone becomes disposable.

Personally, we can’t have more than one right now. Later in life I would like to have three. It will all still depend on our lifestyle and financial situation and whether or not our current dog will get along with another one or two dogs. Also, I don’t want kids so that’s something we wouldn’t have to plan for.

My cousin and his wife got three dogs. They were positive that it wouldn’t be an issue. It wasn’t an issue until they had their second kid to fourth kid. At which point the dogs suddenly became family dogs and have been shuttled around from their parent’s house to my other cousin’s house. And that’s only because my uncle stepped in and said it was wrong to just give the dogs away to whoever. Now, my cousin is going through a shitty divorce and neither of them want the dogs so they’re permanently with my aunt and uncle and the other cousin. And my cousin was swearing up and down that they would never leave the dogs no matter what and that they could take care of them."

I love my mom but we’re very different and so don’t have the same views on life. I can’t talk to her about a lot of things and her advice is a toss up on whether it’s good or not. For example, she was sure that if I went to specific colleges and followed her plan for me that I would be successful and happy. Instead, I got overwhelmed, depressed, constantly thought about driving off the road, hated myself for not being able to get a job of any kind when I moved home, and am $50k in debt from all the student loans she was positive I had to take in order to be successful. When I tried to get help she told me I was wrong and not depressed, I just wasn’t working hard enough. 

So, like hell can I talk to my mom about my feelings or ask for any real world advice about work or school. Relationships are also off the table because she’s a firm believer that a woman has to bear all the emotional labor in any relationship and always admit to being wrong as well as lie and manipulate everyone around her in order for them to do what she wants. Meanwhile, I’m straightforward and refuse to admit fault if it isn’t mine. 

This all goes along with people having kids with certain expectations and getting miffed because the kid grows up with their own personality instead of a fucking obedient clone. No one should ever want kids just so they can have their perfect imaginary parent/kid relationship."
