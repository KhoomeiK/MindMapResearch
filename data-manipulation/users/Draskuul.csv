Avenue5,ffeeggg,t3_eqpy93,1579844964.0,"Two days ago I hadn't even heard of this show.  It was described as an Orville rip-off.  Figured I'd go take a look and just watched it cold knowing absolutely nothing else about it.


I like it.  Yeah it isn't as good as Orville, but it's a bit like comparing oranges and tangerines.  In the same citrus family, but distinctly different enough.


I was surprised to see Hugh Laurie, big fan of him as House.  Having Neelix (Ethan Phillips) around is a big plus.


I definitely got a laugh out of the accent scene.  I actually thought Hugh had managed to slip up until the others in the room brought it up.


I'm hooked and definitely looking forward to more!"

Edit:   To clarify, Stewart can have whatever political stance he wants.   My issue is when he says he is injecting those into Star Trek intentionally."
startrekpicard,ffdyafw,t1_ffc3ybl,1579831939.0,"I came in hopeful but expecting the worst.  Stewart's Trump/Brexit rant, the alternate license, the open fact that it based on STD and not TNG, etc. all painted a grim picture.  Add to that the fact that most of the plot lines are already leaked.


It was better than I expected, but like with STD I have to try to ignore any relationship this has with Star Trek.  It's legally-constrained fanfic, and treating it that way it isn't bad.


Except for the makeup/CGI for Data.  Wow, that was horrible."
