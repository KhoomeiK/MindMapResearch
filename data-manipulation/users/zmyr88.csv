Like I went back to female dress again but last night as male was good too and had a awesome chat with a girl... super surprised... sang some songs with her and talked about my woes.

But what you mean detrans option isn't great"
transmaxxing,ff947so,t1_ff7s00a,1579704446.0,So i should stop trying to transition... Is what your saying since it won't work anyways
transmaxxing,ff7qx6j,t1_ff7q0zk,1579656186.0,"or hormones. i was fine dressing fem. i wanst actually growing the breasts. oops.
yes many will do wonderfully fine. and are better suited some arent. and its toxic and can lead to horrible outcomes for some by not knowing it isnt for everyone who seems trans.  you know how the trans commit suicide because of dysphoria or not being able to transition.... well non trans who transition have very similar problems because they are esentially expriencing what trans to. DYSPHORIA because they were never the opposite sex from birth and their brain rejects it!"

detrans,ff7o1o1,t1_ff7kxow,1579654167.0,wow mine was low form or ROGD but induced and is like falling away as i go through my transition but not finding dysphoria i think so far so it was temporary or just and adjustment.
detrans,ff7n1rh,t1_ff7hygz,1579653466.0,omg that is so me right now. i know something isnt right but afraid to detrans but i'm worred is this dysphoria or just adjusting to a new body.
detrans,ff7mzc6,t3_es2xmv,1579653419.0,"i just want to give you the biggest hug,. i am so sorry you went through this many were lead to believe from various sources and our self this was the defacto right choice no holds barred. 

well supprise it wasnt for some. and that number is growing. i am so sorry you lost what you thought you didnt want and now wish you could have. i am down a pathway that is seriously looking too similar to yours. and i am wanting to be sure than wishy washy and  keep changeing BUUUUTTT  i havent stopped hormones but been given hints (""hello dummy, this is the future knocking "" ""like what you see"") << answer i fight but is looking like  a good chance of a huge no!   


makeup follow the same advice transfemale does. if you take estrogen and go the opposite you are 21. you may beable to reverse it. since you still have changes happening. i wish you the absolute best. and you may not look as bad as you think your brain may just be playing tricks on you. you might still be able to end up just fine....  


take it as pride and a battle scar and a learning exprience. you still have your personality and don't let the haters tell you different. do what you want to do. it helps everyone men women, trans, detrans. fight for our rights to dress how we want and to not be ridiculed for what others think. again i wish you the  best and stay strong."
transmaxxing,ff7kd8e,t3_eqkwht,1579651609.0,"ok and i am gonna call it. what happen if taking the estrogen caused the former dysphoria. which is what i think is happening to me. so i traded one for another and i could have stayed as a CD and been non-dysphoric and i still had many positive relations with women, i think?  


its something i never hear this stuff can have random effects and sometimes that DYSPHORIA thats worse than when you started.   


just want that out there. IT can get worse or go wrong. now most here it went wonderful and they are happy trans girls (hint you were trans to begin with try r/egg_irl , and i fell for that too) also read closeted.  


not all are compatible with transmaxxing and i should have seriously considered i just might be that exception of not being it."

if just the gynomastia. maybe t???/ or weight loss and changes to reduce the e even further but it tends to be permanet except i think for spiro induced ones as its listed on the med that cessation the breats will go back to normal.   
give it time. you didnt grown them overnight so it might take just as long or longe. you are 4 years older now too.   


good luck and i think i might end up the same boat YIKES! and i was so sure of it."

its a good idea but not all the way and NO they really are not trans. just hate being one i think.   
or maybe im off, but then you said the AND part so thats not about transmen right?"

do pronouns make you feel better or he pronouns work just as well.

ask,ff7dswa,t1_ff74w6r,1579647236.0,"not zero in the wiki but lowered. i'd consider even straight up removal of anatomy. but i think i have to supress estrogen, progesterone, and tesosterone, and the adrenal /liver/pancreas i always forget can produce some. like it would have to be absolute 0.  
not sure how to do that high end blockers for both t and E not sure P ones exist???  
i know some monks do something to greatly reduce urges. i want them zeroed though."
ask,ff752kl,t1_ff74w6r,1579641281.0,but i would still have some no? i want full zero of P/E/T right? since even e can raise libido?
detrans,ff5bvk4,t1_ff4hixy,1579586604.0,"Im literally the opposite of this i think. And yeah of you hate the fact your trans your not trending and congratulations your trans join the club... I think I'm finding your not supposed to like it since it brings a road of pain and hurt. You don't transition for fun or an experience but because any other optiom or ignoring will kill you
Literally, spiritually, emotional and or psychically.

There is a huge distinction many trans don't get.
I want to be a girl verses i AM A GIRL.... The later i have a feeling often detrans. And the ones that want to be trans or happy to be trans aren't unless Happy is finding finding you are not f***edup or crazy. 

I am finding strong chance im the former and sad i am. But that has a high chance of detrans"
makeupartists,ff4ptat,t3_edj95c,1579569530.0,I would love to be part of this program. though my budget is tight and and know next to nothing about makeup! but want to learn and support a good company and other. probally not eligible but sounds like a COOL idea.
detrans,ff451qc,t3_erhl3n,1579555698.0,"you say you really really want to. ok i believe you. but also you know its better not to.   
explain more why it won't work and why being a girl is better.  
same as for trans i would ask why and what would make life better and pressures and what not.  
i wonder too why susposedly i think i am not trans but can't seem to want to stop hormones or transition. society is some of the fear to de-trans and everyone question or make fun. other not sure. like what if i decide later i really was trans i won't be able to. and i expected way different, i won't pass. and i never felt i was but i WANTED to be FEMALE. just don't feel i am one.

&#x200B;

i don't buy you are de-trans for the right reasons.... i could be way off because theres not a lot of info.  
you don't give why you ""want "" to detransition other than it seem you can't make it work and it be eaiser to stay.   
the post indicates you are trans but for other reasons are de-trans and if its external or you won't pass i been told and partially agree are the wrong reasons to de-trans.   
you won't become CIS and over time it could get worse the dysphoria.  
some CAN""T and are FORCED to ""de-trans"" for safety and what not. but it doesnt ""get better"" and they less dypshoric or happy.  
what ever you choose i DO SUPPORT YOU 1000%. stay strong!!!!

questions: 

are you 100% happy being a girl for the rest of your life?  
why is it not possible to stay a boy. why is it best not to???   
look deep in to that and answer why and anything could change to make that not apply still.  
you seem to still want to transition but can't.

&#x200B;

questions b:   
what were you reason for transition? do they still apply now?  
if you could have infinite money would that make you more likely to continue?  
if you could have perfect transition according to current medical science  
if you a true sex change, 100% zero side effects everything works 100%  
if no one rejected you in any way for the transition?  
if history always remembered you as transitioned, or that you were CIS that gender?  
IF gender/sex did not exist or was so mininal that it had zero effect on things like money, power, love, safety, happiness, respect etc??? would you still?  
%body vs, mind,spiritual, emotional, social, mental, societial, etc of dypshoria and deisre to trans/detranition."

i'm so sorry you had to go throrough that and to be constantly invalidated by it.   
its valid and you didnt do anything wrong. and you are valid for still feeling hurt by it, i wouldnt blame you if you always held resentment.  


you may be able to depending on statutes and if you can weasle more evidence or do other actions to bring attention to it. idk like you said there is only he said she said they have legally most likely idk. any diary entries. maybe could use that to prove the story never changed?

yeah its better than suicide but to toxicity in the level needed for therapeutic effect is what worries us so much.its more estrone than estraidol in conversion and just has a horrible effectiveness rate and very very high side effects.

MtF,fes3oi3,t1_fersuk0,1579361050.0,"she is not too young while she could later decide to say birth gender now is a good time for blockers and what not for a perfect transition. waiting means more dysphoria if actually trans and a chance for T to do permanent effects on her.

its easy to thing you did wrong or should have ""fought"" you did he refused to listen. he is wrong 100%. i hope you can heal and feel better.  


and it isnt always being a ""doormat"" you just are afraid or in ""hot brain mode"" react different then you swear you would react in trauma ""cold brain mode"". thats not your fault.

yes you opened a can of worms by validating her and while it seemed wrong IT WAS NOT WRONG. she actually knows you care and did know. and knows the truth about your mom.

so i take she was REFUSED the ability to transition and i'm like what a \*\*\*\*\*\* so you can continue to transition but she can't WTF NOT! seems like she wants her to resent you and be like well look who can transtion and who is a MAN and always will be.

if she (or you) wants anyone to talk to or someone out side. my dm always open and so is my phone.

she would have just hid it untill she couldnt take it and she would have figure out someday and likely killed her self or od without knowing any support. i think you did the right thing!!!!

too bad you can't get her to people who care and will allow her to be herself and depending on age show her r/translater after she is in a place to transition or before so she knows she isnt too late to look beautiful. so many can transition still well even though they never thought. i may bring hope.

detrans,fen64bz,t3_epwv04,1579277808.0,"i am so sorry you went through that and lost a piece of you. yeah i do think its so easy to think we want something to be horribly mistaken and regret it. and yeah some stuff is FOREVER and yeah teen or even adult understanding PERMANENT is hard. we are like sure i know i want this.

yeah you are looking at surgery and MTF voice training. to try to get back a glimmer of what you had. it will never be as real and i am so sorry for that.

also remember there ARE girls with deep voices and it can be made to sound nice.

if you don't min the following: just ignore if you don't want to.

was it the vocal change that helped you realize you didnt want to transition?how did you finally come to realization this isnt what you wanted...i am trying to figure this out my self.

and ironically one thing beside the breast change is wouldn't you know it the voice change i am like woah. some days i am like hey its kinda cool. the much deep voice.but i'm half like i want the softer voice. and its changing how i sing. i like the higher parts and its starting to finally affect the higher range enough that i can't compensate for it.

funny thing is when i asked or did my research at the time there was NONE for it lowering it. but murphys law i find all of it once it started (d'oh!).  yeah when taking life altering things do ALL research and don't always trust what people and that can include a doctor or those signed papers say.i wonder if i had stopped when i first notice it bouncing between the two would it go back up since it had not fully set or i am paranoid.

seeing as i am on E & P not T"

I am not out about gender at work closeted by everyone know anyway in that i do not ask to be seen as female but i don't hide it in anyway. Same anywhere else i hide nothing but don't request anything. 
Partial why? Every time i do im shot down for it ask for be called she her they look weird or act like im asking them in Greek. Some say that's weird. Even with pronoun pins people reject it even trans people fuck it up too much to be accident but flat refusal. This includes known gender AFFIRMING places. Im like guess im not trans.

MtF,febhgua,t1_feb7lsn,1578958808.0,"sadly no i actually de-transitioned some. and i am so depressed i may not be able to enjoy being female.  
i used to use ""female"" spaces like bathroom now i feel wrong doing it also got called out and made nervous when some commented really negatively about me being in one. its like i am fighting going back to male but my mind might have ""grown out of the phase"" and i like i not sure i wanted it. i also desperately wanted to belong to a ""group"" so maybe special snowflake and have an identity but maybe im just seeking attention> maybe i'm a tucute :(  


otherwise i dress in feminine clothing but maybe not even the right stuff more like ""fetish"" rather than actual female. but i do like i think the conversations that generally females, like. i wonder is there like a social gender checklist to see which i align with. if i really do align more with female then maybe i actuall AM and just havent given my self permission to be female. like i don't deserve to be or even know what that means to be. i don't know what really male means either so NB maybe. idk so wanted a gender therpist but they said the one i went to was and found out they were NOT.

what would make you most happy. to live permanently as, what about  to be posthumously remembered. what do you specifically dislike about ""gender"" you were born as, what do you like about the other. how did you grow up thinking of what females were. were you taught to be happy or pride in it or more taught they are low or its wrong or bad/discrace to be female. were you validated and felt you could accomplish things or felt you couldnt soly because of being female.  


these can lend a LOT in to some searching.  theres other tests and psych stuff. try with a therapist as well too they may be able to help as well."

SuicideWatch,fe92i9w,t1_fe79kwz,1578933451.0,ive done my research too. i haven't found any that are 100%. honestly i would have already if i knew no chance of ending up in the hospital with a big bill or incapacitated . where you finding your info? way too easy to do it wrong in anxiety and something that should be easy isnt.!

its actually falls under gaslighting misogyny  and institutionalized  and cotton ceiling.  and a heated issue in trans issues. i personally go with the preference side and if you are for that kind its NOT transphobic to me. but then i might not really be trans so i dont' have a say. idk i'm sure they can find plenty that want you as you are or what not idk. i also never had sex so maybe i just don't get that stuff.  or i just don't care   


but idk really. honestly i am finding most transfemale i find i don't do well with anyways. i honestly have been equiv of #metoo from the interaction with at least one trans female,though i been condition to believe its not valid. go figure from transfemales more than anything else.   
ironically susposedly  i am transfemale intestered in females but i wouldn't dare force them to do anything they weren't totally comfortable with, why would i want someone doing it but resenting it i want them happy and enjoying it as much or more than i am.  but idek anymore  and many would say this post would makes me a horrible  transphobic transperson / trans ally i know!"
detrans,fe6vwui,t1_fds5j14,1578906478.0,"Thanks. And your right there way more at play. I did however use it originally as a rule out since I had tried just about everything else. And yeah i really found out some of the extra negative stuff said about fina and Spiro after a few months. 

There's just so much conflicting info on this shit and no one really know it. And like any drug i wanted to know the lead time to feel effects or the reversal when stopping. That has zero mention. Some it's days or immediate others it's month's for the side/main effects in regards to mental. Some affect serotonin or other key transmitters. 

Mainly it's baggage from other shit brought to the table and frustration with poor, wrong ,or no answers from people that claim to have them.

And the forever and a day to get refferals/appointments with the right people to help. Ie psych and endocrine. And further lack of figuring things out.

Still half this shit wasn't even hinted at the possibility and i hate surprises. And less like any guidance on what to do when they show up"
transmaxxing,fe6uaf8,t3_enxb8n,1578905287.0,"I waited 10 years and even though i delayed and still uncertain i wish i had started way earlier then if be where i am now with time before no return... It's too late for me so much that there may be more benefit in not now since no gain can be made by attempting now

31 is too late. I was late at 21 had first inkling then waited longer to be sure what was meant to be 2 years max. Ended up being 10 before i realized it. It's too late....

Don't wait.... Take it seriously at least you will know that much sooner and blockers are way safer to give you more time to decide albeit brief. 

Be sure but just plain waiting isn't right you literally pissed away valuable time."
SuicideWatch,fe5wlri,t1_fe4dgnq,1578876574.0,I guess i missed the post about the your son and maybe even the group. It posted this nonsequiter so it made no sense and i couldn't find any other posts by you
SuicideWatch,fe5w97s,t1_fe580c9,1578876354.0,"Thank you so tired of seeing this being regurgitated .... I can't tell you if it's right or wrong because i don't know your life, your future, your past, or your limits. I do know others will try to stop you and if you don't succeed and hanging has a high chance of failure. There is a very high chance your life will be anything but better instead way worse. Advertising it increases that chance. 

As others said you don't know what lies on the other side and it's a very real possibility it is eternity of something way worse than this making this life seem like nirvana .. Be fully ready for that possibility since you likely won't get a second chance or ability to go back or change it!

Make a pro's/cons and triple fact check your reasons and data/evidence! this isn't a time you want to be wrong!!! What ever you do i hope it's better than what you been dealing with now."

egg_irl,fdz5m96,t1_fdysvc1,1578786948.0,same when i am with my family they would disown me as a woman or any way feminine.actually i need this now to make my AAA (soon to be a) cups disappear since the nipple is good enough i can't be shirtless anymore (damit) and i'm so not used to this it JUST  was so lucky christmas when i visited so you kinda could notice if you really looked for the tissue but they didnt say anything. lets just a few weeks later i don't think i'm going to be so lucky very much longer if it isnt already too late lol.

i hate looking at the r/TransLater form and the other trans form they all post pretty pictures and i get sad and angry and frustrated... then i wonder since i already if i really trans for other things. if i found i really WAS trans is it even worth transitioning i will be the ugly trans girl if i am lucky. but usually i'm just a freak in a dress that is a dude. :(   some are lucky SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LUCKYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY ugh."

egg_irl,fdy84sd,t1_fdvrnar,1578777041.0,"though generally most if not all have a perfered pronoun, its when they are NOT called it they notice more. thats just about everyone. so if you are called one that your are typically not and you feel happier than normal theres a good chance the one society picked for you isnt really yours. that tends to mean trans or its flavors.   
CISGENDER 99.99% of time want to be called their birth sex pronoun. they could be an exception like for me. but other wise. its not gate keeping. and it isnt making you its just saying you are likely egging hard if you still don't consider it"
egg_irl,fdy5h8j,t3_en5auv,1578776304.0,"funny as a kid i don't think it bothered me when i grew up some. but i think its internalized and fear. like i don't believe i am allowed to be female and it got worse reading the anti-trans forms. i want to be but like i don't feel worthy.  
and feels super wrong when i am worried i will get in trouble for it. like not out at work but mis-gendered. though inside smiles a bit."
egg_irl,fdy4zj9,t3_en66vl,1578776206.0,"you really can still be cis tho. just like clothes they don't make you a gender.

likely wasn't meant for this post. no where is 18 mentioned. or it even CLOSE to my age!!!.  
what group are you talking about r/aspergers ?    
or what does the 18 mean? like i am too young to figure out in a figurative way. nah i don't think so. yes i did start transition but the core issues (not trans) i have been dealing with for at least 18+ years they just only gotten way worse as i get older"
meToo,fdwrmv4,t3_dvp377,1578761691.0,"i'm sorry you went through that, and yeah if you aren't is a strong place with good support bringing the stuff up in EMDR or other methods can be quite intense and bring up more than you are ready for.

i would press charges and have the report. it may give hr more power to do more and it might just get him fired honestly which would solve the problem. i can't believe he thought it would be appropriate to take your pants off. do you have any inkling he might have done more that that. 

you did zero wrong in this at all he is totally wrong for violating you while you were a sleep. i wish you the best"
meToo,fdwm9s5,t3_dvarky,1578760158.0,"it was totally NOT right of him to guilt you with ""blue balls"" for not having sex with you.  the part where you ened up giving him head is coercion and its wrong.  
then lets talk he tried ripping your pants off and you were saying NO..... eventually he stopped. nah doesnt cut it. still an A\*\*\*\*\*\* for trying to r\*\*\*\* then gave up after you screaming no.   
its not stupidity and you have every right to feel traumatized i would feel that way too if it happened to me. you are valid and this is a #METOO  
don't be hard on your self he goaded you in to doing more than you wanted and he should be the one feeling bad not you."
meToo,fdwm2e7,t1_f7ft8sh,1578760092.0,"but don't we have the attempted part... trying to force pants down while she is screaming no.

SuicideWatch,fdw22ta,t1_fdumoo0,1578754202.0,i believe you posted this in the wrong area??? this does not match my post. i WISH i was still 18. hell i'd still have actual fighting chance if i put my all. but that ship has long sailed.
meToo,fdsg27n,t3_emwj69,1578701978.0,"i'm sorry you have to keep going through this. though i am unsure what you do. i do understand she keeps finding you, harassing you , messing you, and driving you to leave your job. she and her ~~friends~~ minions shouldn't have that power over you. i would if you can record every interaction especially with you saying as nicely and calmly as possible but also firmly ""leave me alone and stop interacting with me"". your places of employment and depending on what she actually did may be able to pull tapes.   


Keep a log of every interaction and what happened in a journal, names, times, what said, where, actions taken. coming to your work to harass is illegal and can be called or reported each and every time.  some places if you even get a report even if police don't do $&\*&\*$ will honor it and restrict their access/ban them. especially if you can prove she isnt a paying customer but only to cause trouble and that she has a history of just showing up and ""wasting time and resources, merchandise""  


you may have to change name AND move. you shouldnt have to but your life is worth it. you also should consult a lawyer, pro bono if possible. know your options and your defenses. if you have friends you trust maybe work where they or around the same shifts they do... strength in numbers. and when possible don't give any hint she is getting to you (if at all possible, i know next to impossible) usually after a while they do move on if they aren't getting the response they want. or negative attention.  


you also mentioned about not wanting to fight it because of her playing victim card and harassment. and yes initial will have a negative effect but if you heve evidence video and that journal. it \*shouldn't\*  take to long for karma/past to catch up to her and the reputation correct it self yours much better her's seen for what she truly is... and it will be long lasting.   
improving from legit tarnished reputation is way way harder than false allegations when they are disproved ideally publicly. she is going to f\*\*\*\* up a major way some time and people will learn her truth.   


best of luck and i wish you much success an her out of your life for good"
transmaxxing,fdse31h,t3_emkmyk,1578700566.0,"hmm. but it strikes a cord and causes guilt. i have considered transition simply because it has an effect you describe but feel dirty and very wrong like i'm cheating or worse for it. its kept me up sometimes..  i don't feel its fair to ""trick "" so you can get better pool,  


and you don't even have to f\*\*\*\*\*\* try to pass to get the instant benefits. dress feminine and not even that well. and i notice the immediate niceness of females and more wanting to socialize with you. i usually can stave it off for a bit but keeps coming back like i am doing something horribly wrong and immoral or evil/ cheating to do that just so they are nicer.   


wonder if its because i wouldn't like it if done to me and i have been lied to and abused/used cheated so many times i don't trust and i sure as hell don't want to put anyone through that if i can help it. how do you shake that feeling and justify it to your self.  


you even note what this person did  the level up because they are cute now, doesn't rub you the right way. why? and isnt that the same as transmax??? just maybe not as bad or cold??"
