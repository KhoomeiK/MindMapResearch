The worst one, though, is when it happens in the middle of a lecture. I was doing my postgrad before I had to stop because, well things got worse. But my courses are extremely difficult. If I stop listening for a second I'll be completely lost. But I could spend the entire lecture trying very to focus on not crying and breaking down in front of everyone right then and there."

GossipGirl,ffymzej,t3_evtc1n,1580350276.0,"Idk man I'd be pretty pissed too if I had someone who was obviously still hung up on the ex and humiliated them in front of all their friends and family (not to mention the nation) at their wedding.  


I've said it before and I'll say it again: you have to remember that perception is key and if we were following Louis' story, Blair would seem like a manipulative, cruel, stupid gold-digger who only wanted Louis for his prince title. As much as I love Blair, MAN did she do Louis dirty and I will defend that to the grave."
PlayTemtem,ffwf2vs,t1_ffsq40n,1580298606.0,Ugh Mushi is literally the cutest temtem to me that it makes Mushook look worse T.T I mean pokemon has that issue too where the evolutions can look a lot worse than the starter but jeez when you've got a great design like Mushi don't make it look awkward af later
PlayTemtem,ffwew3d,t1_f9wjyss,1580298388.0,"This is...not the smartest thing to do. This, along with that one temtem that looks exactly like Cubone and the other that looks like Zamazenta and is literally called Raican, only makes Temtem look even more like a pokemon rip-off and won't let it stand on its own.  


On the other hand, there are so many good fakemon out there that we all wish were real and would be cool to see them in another game. But again, might as well just call Temtem 'Fakemon the Game'"
depression,fft6hpc,t1_fft6a45,1580209619.0,"thing is, I more than anyone definitely know that life revolves around money. Any moron saying money doesn't buy happiness has never lived in a household where money is a constant issue. It may not buy happiness but financial security can go a long way.

I'm tired of stressing. At this point, what you mention about being homeless, I could honestly not care if that is what ends up happening to me if it means speeding up the process."

You could argue Cullen is a huge fanservice but that doesn't make his romance any less cute

Fanservice or not Morrigan is still one of my faves"

dragonage,ffenpy8,t1_ffeniw8,1579856252.0,That's definitely an unpopular opnion! out of curiosity why did you find her pitifil in Inquisition?
dragonage,ffdk5ty,t1_ffculjy,1579822599.0,"Ah may be why I can't stand her then.  


I mean I say that but upon meeting Leliana in origins, the game does a good job in making you believe she would be cute but stupid only to reveal she's really really not. Sooo I guess technically 'cute but stupid' can seem like a very interesting trope if done properly."
dragonage,ffdjlar,t1_ffc5u59,1579822248.0,"See, Vivienne  agreeing with Inky if she conscripts the mages made me realise that just because you want more freedom with mages doesn't mean you have to hate Vivienne. On the contrary, I played as an Inky who was very liberal in her views with mages because she's been relatively sheltered by the dangers in Ostwick but after seeing the freakin' world destroyed all because of a few mages, she begins to rethink her stance on the Circle.

A middle ground must be met. A reform is necessary yes but templars and circles are still very much something in need. I may find Vivienne to go too far in her insistence that the Circle is seemingly perfect, but she is the closest one to make sense of it from a logical, reasonable perspective as opposed to just saying 'but they need their freedom because it's sad :'( '  


I do especially think she has a very sheltered POV. The way she speaks of her own Circle made it sound like a dream, but we know from Origins that the Circles are so corrupt that many mages are constantly abused in the worst ways. It's a shame there's no option to take Vivienne to the Circle of Magi from Origins or perhaps for Cullen to reveal to her the true nature of the templar-mage relationship.   


But the upside to knowing how Viv's experience with her own Circle is that we know it IS possible to have a good Circle. Difficult but not impossible.

It's also worth noting that unlike SOMEONE coughsolascoughs, even if you don't have high affinity with her, she still speaks with you respectfully and is unafraid to share her opinions. She doesn't act like a pouty child about it. I headcanon that while Vivienne may not like the Inquisitor depending on how you play them, she will always respect them at the very least."

dragonage,ffd5zt7,t1_ffbp2v7,1579814087.0,I never romanced her and tbh even if all the women were romanceable I would go for Cass or Viv anyday but why do people say Sera is abusive?
dragonage,ffd3oua,t1_ffct2n6,1579812805.0,"Not sure I agree especially since everyone's argument for disliking Sera is the fact that she's rude and disrespectful.

If we're gonna talk about characters you can't mold, it's not like DA is short on it. Anders, Solas, Vivienne, Morrigan. But as we've seen people can still like them for various reasons."
