So if you do a bunch of these you will be able to figure out that this is a natural occurrence which happens fairly slowly (geological timescale) and with a stage in the middle where there is no single north or south but more like a scramble of poles all around. So yeah every stone has this basically, so I don’t get what the big deal is?"
