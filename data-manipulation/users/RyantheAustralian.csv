AskReddit,ffetc1w,t3_et6o9u,1579864567.0,"From what I've learned from all these types of movies/TV shows, the best way to avoid suspicion that you've been bitten is to angrily roar at them that you haven't been bitten, while sweating profusely and insist that mysterious patch - almost bitemark-esque - you won't let them go near is 'nothing'. All while talking about the capacity of brains, a subject you've never spoke about before this.

MMA,ff3uztv,t1_ff3tr1r,1579549438.0,"No, but Anderson took umbrage with something he said, which I don't think was actually even meant to be a criticism. It was something about how he has two sides to him, and I think by that he meant he can be calm and composed, and a gentle family man, and then a killer in the cage. Silva took it to mean he was two-faced, or 'wore a mask', hence why he wore that mask during the face-off at the weigh-ins.

That's from my memory though, which is spotty at best. It's something like that, though"

Next week: here, talk to my mother."" ""Dad, she'll tell everyone!"" ""It's just her!""

nothing would stop him til he'd told everyone. Everyone knew what I didn't want them to know and specifically asked him not to tell everyone, which he took to mean ""don't tell a big crowded room of them"" so instead he told them one at a time til everyone knew.
