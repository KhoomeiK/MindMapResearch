AskReddit,ffdekoa,t1_ffdbsz8,1579819228.0,"Is that a subway or train? I’ve never been to Chicago. I guess to some people the words are interchangeable but here the Subway is the MTA; use your metro card, swipe once, and you can stay on a long as you want and go anywhere as long as you don’t go back to the turnstiles. The actual trains to me are the ones that take you in and out of the boroughs to upstate NY (metro north), Long Island (LIRR), NJ (NJ Transit) it to Boston or DC (Amtrak) and those all have the conductors. 


Subways have letters like yours, 1/2/3 line, A/C/E line etc while the trains are just the trains, no really signifier besides “get on at this platform”"
