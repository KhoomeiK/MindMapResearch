CanadianForces,felnmvm,t1_felncpr,1579226496.0,"Thank you so much. One more thing: I want to become a pilot as fast as I can and am thinking of going to RMC. If I don’t feel confident in my athletic ability, should I go to civilian university instead?"
CanadianForces,felj78s,t3_eo0uz0,1579223465.0,"Hello, I am a 16 year old air cadet and I’ve been thinking a lot about my future. I’m passionate about aviation and want to be a pilot, and military training sounds good but I’m also very unsure. I love the structure and discipline in cadets as well as the people I’ve met, but I’m not sure it will be like that in the real CAF. I’ve heard many terrible things about the military life but I’ve also heard a few good things. I’m also worried about the physical requirements; I’m in good shape but I’m not athletic. Will I not qualify for basic training? Overall, I feel that the Canadian forces website only talks of the benefits and I feel skeptical looking through it. If I want to become a pilot should I be civilian trained? Or is life in the Canadian forces not as bad as people say? (I don’t want to be a fighter pilot, by the way. I’d rather fly transport or SAR)

TL; DR: is life in the CAF as horrible as I’ve been told? If I want to be a pilot should I really go the military route? I’m not athletic, can I get in to basic training?"
