rarepuppers,ff4w7kx,t1_ff4tqmq,1579573925.0,"How is a breeder unethical for breeding for the best possible traits in a dog and maximizing the chances that my puppy wont have severe health issues? My Golden retriever came from a good breeder with a history of the family lineage, showing it was a line with minimal health issues from what i could see. 9 years later she still heathy thankfully and her hips for example are in great condition. If I pick up a dog from a rescue and then later down the road I have to deal with health issues, not that all shelter dogs will have issues obviously but thats not really fair to me mentally or financially to have to deal with that

Edit: I didn’t downvote either of you btw, I think yall have valid points and rescuing animals can be a great option but people shouldn’t feel ashamed when they want to get a puppy with a (somewhat) known genetic heritage"
