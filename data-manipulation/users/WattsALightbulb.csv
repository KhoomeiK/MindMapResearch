SuicideWatch,ffsmbfz,t1_ffsl4qf,1580185317.0,"My girlfriend sent drunk nudes back and forth to one of her coworkers and then dumped me two days later because I ""treated her like shit"", then told me that she kissed another girl on New Years Eve. Within the past week she's been making excuses not to have a talk with me about everything, saying she's ""busy the rest of the week"" when I'm fairly certain that right now all she's doing is sitting around at her house doing absolutely nothing. If she's trying to treat me the way she feels I treated her, then she's doing a shit job. I tried my best to make her feel loved even when my self-hatred was the strongest feeling in my head. We're supposed to talk Wednesday and I'm gonna really have to bite my tongue otherwise I'll say something to purposely hurt her and definitely make things worse.

She too is my first girlfriend, but I truly feel like she's special. She told me that a true soulmate wouldn't do what she did to me, and maybe she's right. She's a true cunt for sending nudes to another guy *while I was probably there with her*, but the fact that she was fucking wasted kinda helps"
