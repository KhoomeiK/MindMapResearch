CatastrophicFailure,ff7csu4,t1_ff7bsgj,1579646563.0,"Yes the climate has always changed, and in no way does that doesnt conflict with the fact humans are changing the climate. There's literally no other explanation for the fact the earth warmed 1 degree celcius since the industrial revolution. Seriously, look at a graph of temperature changes over time with the scale at 100,000's or 1,000,000's years. There is no fucking chance in hell amount of that warming happening so suddenly; 100 years is a tiny amount of time at that time scale. You'll see plenty of dips and peaks over time, like you said, and then at the tiny tiny edge of the graph it will shoot up so fast its basically a straight line. Completely unprecedented in earth's history, and just so happens to coincide with humans industrializing their society."

selfimprovement,ff6ccf7,t1_ff6bh90,1579624100.0,"I don't have any experience with long distance relationships so I cant say for sure. But honestly I wouldn't get too emotionally invested in this person (especially to the point of constant jealousy) until you actually meet him in person. In the meantime, you should probably reflect on your own insecurities, like how long you've had them and why, and then consider a therapist."
selfimprovement,ff6998v,t3_erw709,1579622117.0,"Self esteem issues are common. The only cure is to feel good about yourself regardless of what anyone else may or may not think. But that is a lot harder than it sounds, especially if you maybe have a lifetime of self esteem issues and you're in a relationship.

Is the sex life good in your relationship? Or is it really one sided, with only one person ever initiating? That could really lower someone's self esteem. Personally I only feel insecure if my girlfriend doesn't want me, or if I always have to initiate. But only you can figure out why you're insecure, and then figure out which aspects of your insecurity valid or toxic. Like I said, if your boyfriend literally pays not attention to you that's a valid reason to be insecure."

starterpacks,fegud4t,t1_fegslm7,1579102734.0,"Back in 2013, the IPCC's consensus was that we are well on way to killing ourselves unless we take drastic change immediately (we haven't and we won't), and a lot of the new science that has come out since then has shown that we underestimated how much damage we've been causing. For example, we underestimated the effect of global dimming (and therefore the under estimated the climate's sensitivity carbon), we over estimated the oceans capacity to absorb heat, and we under estimated methane emissions and other feedback loops. So as a result, events like the Australian fires or the acidification of the ocean are happening even faster than scientists expected a few years ago."
