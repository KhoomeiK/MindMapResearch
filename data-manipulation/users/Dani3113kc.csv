LetsNotMeet,ffui1eu,t1_ffueetq,1580242385.0,"I skipped.down to This was Dennis. Good story, but needs to be cut down a lot."
BelgianMalinois,ffqpz84,t1_ffq3sk3,1580140932.0,DOGGIE NIPS PIC
BelgianMalinois,ffqpwom,t1_ffq02b8,1580140885.0,"That's true. We do obedience every day. Just in passing. She needs the reminders. 

I agree tho. If you dont enjoy dog sports and dog training, you wont enjoy having a mal."
BelgianMalinois,ffpulea,t1_ffp04gy,1580106298.0,"My mal rarely sheds. And tbh she is a regular dog to me. I make sure she has exercise and play with her and whatnot. But if we dont go on a walk it's alright. We will play in the house or something. 

She is a lot of work, but so is my gsd. So I guess... dont freak out. They're still dogs lol. They're not some crazy robot machine that only the very best dedicated humans can handle."
BelgianMalinois,ffpucn4,t3_euawp2,1580106037.0,The tinder pic needs to be a dick pic. Let's be honest. Hah
creepyencounters,ffpt5ps,t3_eudhew,1580104764.0,"I carry a gun and a knife in my purse so this isnt unbelievable to me lol.

And from one asshole to another, heyyyyy!"
creepyPMs,ffpsygi,t3_eu9iqi,1580104555.0,Tbh I would be so mad if a guy cut my clothes off. Massive turn off haha
creepyPMs,ffpsszr,t3_eu8div,1580104398.0,"This could be broken into like... 4 sentences, man.

I saw your pics and you look interesting, I would like to get to know you better. I just had to send you a message and see if you wanted to chat! 

That's it..."
LetsNotMeet,ffpr0rd,t3_euicrh,1580102654.0,"I dont even know how I would contain myself if someone threatened my baby in anger. Both my husband and I conceal carry, I would make sure he stayed long enough to be arrested. Oh man I'm so mad for you!"
LetsNotMeet,ffjrhbv,t1_ffhxd8h,1580005003.0,"But you dont understand! A guy was *staring* at me for a minute at a Walmart! AND I DIDNT EVEN KNOW HIM AND I NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN!!!

LetsNotMeet,ffi8gu3,t1_ffhs61b,1579967800.0,Exactly. What a cowardly selfish man to let his daughter be molested to protect his reputation.
LetsNotMeet,ffh8gpx,t1_ffh4lpi,1579926111.0,I watched it and me and my sister were blown away. Those shit parents should have been charged with something not gonna lie. It was absurd how incompetent and stupid they were. I was disgusted.
LetsNotMeet,ffeyu3t,t1_ffetbsc,1579870751.0,Dude I wonder the same thing
BelgianMalinois,ffdmx2y,t1_ffcsm2t,1579824290.0,"I havent seen anything that says they were bred to be a farm dog. Herding yes but I'm amazed yours doesnt eat your chickens. Mine would eat a chicken if she got the chance. Not my gsd tho, thank goodness. 

If you need a mal that doesnt eat your birds then you're lucky to have a mal with such low prey drive. Bc it isnt normal to be that chill unless you've done a shit ton of training for him to be that way."
OpenDogTraining,ff921vy,t1_ff91osc,1579702907.0,"Same. Mine has bad manners with other dogs so he just doesnt get to meet them anymore. He pulls less since he knows it's not gonna happen. Dogs dont need to have other dogs, they just need you. If you want to do a play date with a dog friend that's a good idea. But dont feel like your dog is going to be depressed if she cant meet dogs all day on walks."
LetsNotMeet,ff91uwf,t1_ff8kexu,1579702762.0,AND IT WAS PRETTY SMALL TO BEGIN WITH. HE CANT AFFORD THAT
BelgianMalinois,ff91t1q,t1_ff8k3n8,1579702723.0,"Thata awesome. Mine didnt have positive interactions with kids when she was little, unfortunately.  And we didnt live around a lot of people either. Her socialization was garbage till we moved. 

Shes better with people now, but she still thinks kids are scary. She loves my baby tho. I'm hoping she gets better with kids.

As for other animals... man. I would be glad if she could at least walk by another dog without losing her mind."
creepyencounters,ff91lbe,t1_ff8hw1a,1579702562.0,"Lol they kind of are but they're also super friendly. I'm sorry if I worded it weird, I dont have one. I have a gsd and a mal."
LetsNotMeet,ff91fqt,t1_ff8hgrf,1579702446.0,"I know women can be predators. But it's such a small percentage compared to how many pedos are men. It's not usually a woman who is taking pictures of little boys at parks and masterbating in the car next to the school crossing walk. It's not usually the woman who hides in the bathroom at the pool and tries to molest any little boy who comes in alone. And its not usually a woman who is caught with 10 terabytes of kiddie porn and a bunch of traumatized neighbor boys. 

I know women can be molesters. But women predators are about as common as women serial killers. Male molesters are about as common as... well... perverted men. So... very common."
BelgianMalinois,ff8chqj,t1_ff8ccgs,1579672893.0,Dominant super sucks I'm sorry. My gsd is fairly dominant but hes never taken over when I was gone. He just seems to lose his hearing. Suddenly he cant hear commands. It's a mystery. /s
BelgianMalinois,ff878pq,t1_ff861sg,1579667987.0,Yeah yours seems like hes not a giant bag of dicks like mine.
BelgianMalinois,ff85f2u,t1_ff83rh6,1579666481.0,Hahaha that's funny
BelgianMalinois,ff83ay6,t1_ff80lbm,1579664858.0,"She would wait till there was some room (from tugging on the leash) and get her jaw under it and chew it off. She went thru one a week. I gave up after 3. 

Now she wears an ecollar instead. Or shes naked."
creepyencounters,ff7v6d3,t1_ff7umax,1579659120.0,Lol ok good
