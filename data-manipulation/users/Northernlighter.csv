Aluminium foil tends to create hot spots too apparently when it is crumpled up. But I never got any issues from that with LED. Might be worse with HPS because there is a lot more heat than LED."

movies,fc7i7rn,t1_fc7eo2m,1577508223.0,"The myth about the invasion of Poland is that it was a walk in the park. It was not. It is nowhere near a defeat for Germany and they succeeded rather quickly, but none the less, Germany lost more tanks than Poland had in total. Out of 2700 tanks, they lost 250 tanks and 800 vehicles. The Poles lost 150 tanks and they were being attacked on both sides. Soviets lost less than 50 tanks... It took a full month to take half of Poland, only a week less than the invasion of France. When you put all those numbers together, it is a very cringy victory for the Germans.

Also Germany massively relied on horses in it's army. British and French were almost completely mechanized armies. Most likely a side effect of having your armed forces reduced and limited between the wars.  Germany was nowhere near ready for a full out war with the allies. The key in their victory was communication between its different armies and meth... holy shit these guys were on meth througout the invasion of France (and probably the war)

Yes, the horses vs tanks is an overinflated myth and probably only happened once during the invasion but it remains that Germany suffered a lot during that invasion and it scared most of the german commanders to turn around and face a real army like France and Britain.

Oh and don't worry I read a lot of books on the subject and watched probably most of the documentaries on the subject. If you know any good ones, please do tell."
