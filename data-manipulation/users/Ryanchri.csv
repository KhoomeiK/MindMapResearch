It's on trashy because people mindlessly upvote

Blackface is frowned upon yes, but this isn't blackface

If I go out and give myself this same bad tan I wouldn't be called racist. People would just think I have a bad tan.

Neither did mine. What's your point?

You do care because you're going around this thread calling random people racist.

>Have you ever noticed, whenever a multiplatform game releases, most of bug reports come from pc users? Three months ago RDR2 launched on pc, how many people could even play their games because of some verification fiasco or something? Division, Destiny, etc


This is just the fault of the developer making poor PC ports not a fault of the PC itself. And I've seen tons of bug reports coming from console too


>Whenever a dev announces system requirements for an upcoming game, reddit gets flooded with “can my rig run it?” posts from pc users

When they say this they mean at a decent frame rate of 60fps. If you get a decent rig you can run pretty much any game. Consoles don't worry about that because most games are locked at 30. And for your storage problems Micro ATX builds do exist and can be even smaller than a console.
