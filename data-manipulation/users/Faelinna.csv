Decisions like that don't seem to get any easier with time. I've decided on not going but have taken the coward's way out, simply by not responding to the wedding invite. I do have good reasons because everytime I do contact my brothers my mother instantly tries to rope me back in. Two years ago, when NC was still fresh, I sent my brother a happy new year text as an answer to his and not even two minutes later I received a text from my mother about how disappointed she was and how much of a horrible person I am. It's sad to miss a life event like that, especially when you like your sibling. If you don't want to be as cowardly and just not react to the invite tell them what you just told us, that going would be bad for your mental health and that you need time to heal and grow. If she loves you, she will understand."
