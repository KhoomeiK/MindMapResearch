No, hunting for conservation is not necessary. Let’s break down the main myth... Hunting revenue being reinvested into conservation efforts? Give me a break. You know you’re in the wrong when even president trump calls it a horror show.

“You will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal.”

Anyway, WildCRU, the hero of saving lions! “Although there are only 20 000 wild lions left in Africa, it appears that WildCRU’s role is not just to protect the lions. Rather, the likes of the WildCRU is important to Oxford, “not for the protection of lions so much as the attraction of postgraduate students and funding”."

The fact that you think that the cycle of nature can’t take care of itself shows how highly you think of yourself, and how delusional you are."
JusticeServed,fglxf5o,t1_fglwril,1580913285.0,"Conservation, a common defense of those who enjoy murdering animals. It really allows you to continue the facade, doesn’t it? “I’m saving species here, idiots!”

Overpopulation takes care of itself in nature through starvation and disease, we don’t need sociopaths to do the work in place of nature.

Again, the difference between poaching and hunting is that one is legal, the other isn’t, and one group thinks they’re heroes, while the other knows that they’re scum."
JusticeServed,fglwjr6,t1_fglw4wi,1580912666.0,"Calling me a vegan after scanning through my post history, and using it to dismiss my argument? Yes, that’s a shitty thing to do, just like killing animals.

And you’re right, killing an animal for sport or for food is very different than killing an animal and selling it for “parts”. One is legal and the other isn’t. That’s the main difference. Fundamentally, they’re not that different."

JusticeServed,fglvkmz,t1_fglvfyx,1580911980.0,And of course an omni would say this. I find it amusing that my comment made you look through my post history.
