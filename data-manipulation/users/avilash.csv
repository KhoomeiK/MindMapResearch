Dynavap,fgpdocr,t1_fgmlvfc,1581002700.0,"That sounds a bit quick (if you are wanting clouds at least).

You may be thinking ""I need to get the flame hotter/ closer to the device to get big clouds because both of these things equal a higher temp""

However that is not the truth. Actually the thinking should be: ""I want to heat it slow/ evenly so that the entire bowl can get up to temp before the cap clicks""

So remember:

1. Put your torch on a low setting so that it still produces a nice steady flame, but not low enough to either sputter or essentially be a pilot light.
2. Keep torch a finger's width between the device and the luminous part of the flame. I generally barely touch with the outer part of the flame which again will often be a finger's width.
3. Heat low on the cap at the N, and spin steadily so that the entire thing has a chance to heat evenly.

Following those 3 steps, you should be able to increase the amount of time it takes for the click to happen which will likely lead to clouds."

If it is zone shots tripping you up, might need to get in the habit of using zone speed to catch them easier."
Dynavap,fggillr,t3_ey7g9y,1580762630.0,"Sounds like people have you covered: holding torch too close might be a part of the issue (I try to barely touch with the outer part of the flame which is often a finger's width between the  luminous part of the flame and the device).

Another thing I didn't see anybody mention though:

Cooling/airflow will affect flavor. I'd encourage you to experiment and try keeping the airport open and give a strong 8-10 inhale. This will usually lead to tastier hits when compared to restricting the flow."
Splatoon_2,fgfue79,t3_ey4o5t,1580747822.0,"I think people have already answered: some controllers don't have gyro/ motion controls.

If you are looking for a pro controller alternative, a few companies that make good gyro enabled controllers:

8bitdo SN30 Pro ($45 on Amazon) or the 8bitdo SN30 Pro+ ($49 on Amazon)

PowerA Enhanced Wireless Controllers ($37 - $50 on Amazon depending on style)

As far as differences between 8bitdo and the Enhanced Wireless:

A big pro for 8bitdo: it's actually rechargeable, no need to mess with batteries

A big pro for PowerA Enhanced wireless: you can actually turn on the system using the controller's Home button.

I think 8bitdo is likely the superior controller, but you can't turn on the system with the controller, and syncing/pairing the controller can sometimes be a bit finicky. The PowerA, once you get past the need for batteries (I got a nice set of rechargeable AA's) I'm actually quite impressed with it. The syncing/pairing is quite speedy, so I find this controller better than the 8bitdo if you are needing to pair with multiple systems on a regular basis."

Dynavap,fg6gdhe,t3_ex6fzo,1580567214.0,"Question is...do you need to find it?

The adjustable airflow condenser should be enough to adjust the airflow where you want it. 

Also, I recently made the discovery that airflow is king, and even a completely uncovered M airport still produces great results"
Dynavap,fg48ndg,t1_fg47fa9,1580498484.0,"Maybe? From strain to strain you might find differences. The more ""terpy"" strains tend to get the biggest clouds.

But...if it is a case of it not being dry enough, then the first 1-2 cycles should be enough heat to take care of drying it out and then the 3rd cycle should be exactly where you want it....

If the behavior doesn't change on the 3rd+ cycle...I'd say it isn't because of that."
Dynavap,fg48eod,t1_fg46ls4,1580498337.0,"I mean during heat up many Dynavaps will have a soft click followed 1-2 seconds later by a much louder click.

When I first started out I'd always stop on that soft click and get no vapor because of it. When I finally realized I needed to wait for the louder click it became easier. Sometimes I won't hear both clicks, but I at least recognize the difference between a soft click, and THE click."
Dynavap,fg460qb,t1_fg45hly,1580496883.0,"The only other thing, there are multiple clicks, if you heat past the first click you should hear a second 2-3 seconds after...and that's the click you'll want.

But you likely have already experienced this since you are in the habit of going past. At this point, I'd say you should contact Dynavap as it definitely sounds like you have a defective cap."
Dynavap,fg37acd,t3_ewczbe,1580473121.0,"Other than making sure it is clean...like if you look through the pieces in the light does everything look shiny? Definitely pop the screen out and clean the bowl.

Other than that some advice: try keeping the airport completely open and take a big 7-10 second hit. You'll still get clouds but they will be cooler therefore taste better."
Dynavap,fg35ukn,t1_fg1et2y,1580471549.0,"Yes, cold weather will make it take longer to reach the click....but the the temperature the bowl is when the click happens shouldn't change.

The only thing that could change this is if you have air blowing right on the cap. I could see this having an effect.

Are you using a single flame? If so also make sure you keep the flame so that the outer part of the flame barely touches (general rule: finger width between luminous part of flame and device).

EDIT: Just wanted to mention I fully extracted a bowl in three hits in a detached garage where it was below freezing."
Dynavap,fg0n85p,t1_ffzs4it,1580411203.0,"I have to do all my vaping in the garage out back often while it is below freezing. I can tell you simply being cold outside won't make it not click. Yes it will change the behavior a bit, the clicks take longer to come, but even in cold weather respecting the click still gets the job done.

However as I stated in another comment, I could potentially see airflow/wind hitting the cap being a culprit."
Dynavap,fg0mwiu,t3_ew4s4m,1580411001.0,"If you are 100% confident that you waited for the cooldown clicks, you are heating it in the moderate middle position, and you stop as soon as you hear *the* click...I'd say there is a chance your cap is faulty.

I suppose one thing I've heard is if you have a ceiling fan/ air vent blowing at you while heating it...it is possible that airflow is enough to throw off the click timing...(the airflow is enough to cool the cap, but not enough to cool the bowl)."

[Dynavap Glass](https://www.dynavap.com/dynashop/accessories/glass/)

I've been eyeing the new Galaxy glass stem/bodies they have, and I think it would look quite good with a [Titanium Spinning Mouth Piece](https://www.dynavap.com/dynashop/vaporizers-parts/titanium-spinning-mouthpiece/)

Since I want the mouth piece I either have to get the [Standard Condenser](https://www.dynavap.com/dynashop/vaporizers-parts/standard-titanium-condenser-with-o-rings/) + the Galaxy Glass Body (which will make it the perfect size for the Dynastash I already own for my M);

Or, I could get the [XL condenser](https://www.dynavap.com/dynashop/vaporizers-parts/xl-titanium-condenser-with-o-rings/) plus the Galaxy Glass stem. This will make it longer...but longer means more cooling...but this also means I'd need to get a new stash as it would be too long for my current."
Dynavap,ffzyh2d,t3_ew5s8w,1580396097.0,"One thing you'll need to know about upgrading is the difference between ""stem"" and ""body"" (main difference being the length). 

The dynavap M is of ""stem"" length. This means a standard condenser is the perfect length to sit flush, but will not support addition of mouth piece.  If you want to add a mouth piece to a ""stem"", you'll need to get an XL condenser + mouth piece.

A quick breakdown of the options:

Standard length:

""Body"" & mouthpiece + standard condenser

""Stem"" + standard condenser (no room for mouth piece)

XL Length:

""Stem"" & mouth piece + XL condenser

So based on this knowledge you could look into getting a galaxy glass piece (they offer both stems and bodies) depending on how long you want it to be."

Dynavap,ffxtm3x,t3_evsaz8,1580332174.0,"1. Keep your torch as low as possible (still produces a steady flame without flicker)
2. Keep flame at least a finger width away from the luminous (brightly visible) part of the flame. I tend to barely touch with the non bright aura around the luminous part.
3. Heat toward bottom of the cap. This way it gives it a chance to get the entire bowl up to temp before the click happens.
4. Listen for the appropriate click. It is common you'll hear a soft click followed by a louder click 2-3 seconds later. To figure this out...heat it without anything in it. When you hear the click, keep going for 4 seconds. Does another click happen? This is the one you want to listen for.

Outside of that, airflow is a big part, so definitely loosely pack, and leave room at the top of the bowl so that the grooves can breathe."

What I mean is my cap/ lighter combo more often than not has a soft click followed by a louder click 1-2 secs later. I always have to remember to wait for the second click.

This isn't always the case...if you use a multi flame lighter it could just lead to a single click."

Perhaps the click behavior is different than your other one. Heat it up empty....go 3 seconds past the first click you hear. Does it eventually click again? If so it is that second click you want to aim for.

The only other thing I can think is if perhaps it is an airflow issue where the grooves around the tip and the divets on the top of the tip aren't as deep as your other Maybe take a picture of your tip? (The AuruM tip...just to be clear)"

Dynavap,fec4bss,t3_eoaq8f,1578966458.0,"Things you can do while your gums heal (definitely don't want to risk causing a dry socket):

1. Disassemble and clean. You can soak everything in Iso except the cap. You can sponge bath the cap with soap/water/ and a qtip and then dry with a qtip as well.

2. Give it a couple dry runs to see what the click is like. Go 3 seconds past the click. Does your device soft click and it is followed by a louder second click? It's that second one you are looking for. Only a single loud click? Then that's the one. I should note different torch types will have different behaviors depending on how quickly they get the cap up to temp.

As far as airport: I only recently discovered (been Dynavappin since October) that keeping the airport open the entire time is definitely worth a try. A nice long, steady 10 second pull...its very smooth. Looking for hotter more dense vapor? Then you can start restricting it...but I wouldn't 100% obstruct.

So with that disclaimer out of the way the RosiuM is probably the most sensitive to cap color discoloration...the PhantoM is the least. I like the colored M's. The feel is nice...seems a bit heavier, and everything is coated: tip, cap, stem, and even the   condenser.

Remember everything is interchangeable. Hell if you wanted to you could attach a Ti tip to the RosiuM stem. If you had a friend get a colored M of a different color...you could swap some parts for a unique color profile. I'd love to do a Black & Gold combo."
Dynavap,fdxqhkh,t3_en9ds8,1578771827.0,"I always rule of thumb keep a finger width between bright part of flame and device.

Also go past the click for about 4 seconds dry...just to know it's click behavior. Does it have a soft click, then followed by another louder click? This is the click you want. Or does it just click once? Then this is where you need to stop.

Lastly, make sure you leave plenty of room for airflow. Don't pack it tight....maybe only fill three forths.

As last thing I'll say...seriously try with the airport open the entire time. Take a big 10 second steady pull...it produces a lot of vapor."

Dynavap,fdbp27k,t3_ekgcj8,1578259637.0,"First off, good on you for being such a good room mate. 

Dry flower vaporization is essentially roasting the product as opposed to setting it on fire. Things in the kitchen smell much better when they are baking instead of burning. Point being, that means it is going to smell a lot like the product. Better than burning, but if it is already a smell you don't care for...

But it doesn't stick around like smoke tends to. This also allows the device to stay relatively clean compared to combustion. No ashes to worry about, clean up is a breeze, and it doesn't get that nasty old ash smell combustion gives. Basically a perfect device to have indoors/ around a room mate. 

There are definitely easier dry herb vaporizer that run on batteries, but the analog nature of the Dynavap really allows you to fine tune your experience from vapor production to look and feel of the device. Dynavap is pretty much a hobby.

2019 M is fantastic. Definitely get a torch. There is some question on flame count. I know everyone around here is all about recommending a single flame torch. Honestly, I'm starting to think a dual flame might be better especially for the hikes as it will get it up to temp faster."
