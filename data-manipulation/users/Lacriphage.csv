technology,fgln3le,t1_fglig3e,1580905033.0,Yes.  Corporate business 101 is short term profit > sustainability.  Bleed it dry and move on.

ABoringDystopia,ffjgx95,t1_ffiarzq,1579998002.0,They're incredibly predictable.
ABoringDystopia,ffiaic1,t1_ffi6dog,1579969236.0,"In my experience, working in healthcare, this really doesn't seem to be the case.  People who can bring themselves usually do.  

The people who come in via ambulance for inconsequential things usually don't know it was inconsequential until after the fact.  If you're in your 60's and already not in the best of health, you don't always know if it's a heart attack or gas and the last place you need to be if it's the former is behind the wheel."

SelfAwarewolves,ffhmxb6,t1_ffhky2z,1579943031.0,I'd wager that it's a balance between squeezing as much out of the patient/insurance company as possible and not wanting to be so egregious that it's cheaper to sue them.
IncelTears,fff6ced,t1_fff0s1m,1579876838.0,Bear and... Wait.....
me_irl,ffewg35,t1_ffeuovu,1579868358.0,From the idea that people shouldn't be assholes to each other.  Try to keep up.
morbidquestions,ffe81nt,t1_ffcfnzq,1579839220.0,Yea I'm not surprised.  People like that need treatment but as a society we're more interested in punishment.
me_irl,ffe60po,t1_ffdp5b4,1579837625.0,The Satanic Temple.  Church of Satan is a completely different organization.
me_irl,ffe5gnl,t1_ffdsjjw,1579837200.0,Except that they aren't.  Not treating each other like garbage is part of a number of pre-Christian religious traditions.
me_irl,ffe4zb6,t1_ffd3vys,1579836839.0,Yep.  Feudalism is the end result of ancap.

me_irl,ffcic3g,t1_ffcfco3,1579800083.0,That's kind of the point tho.  At least part of the reason they use satanic imagery is to shake up Christians.

OutOfTheLoop,ffcde1p,t1_ffccvcg,1579797038.0,Eh.  That's stuff that actual leftists can't even really agree on.
me_irl,ffcd3sc,t1_ffc9qg2,1579796863.0,"Iirc the three biggest satanic organizations are TST, CoS and Temple of Set.  Setians are the only ones who believe in a literal diety"
me_irl,ffccnvy,t1_ffcc8h8,1579796587.0,"Really there could be a whole book here on the subject but basically TST doesn't actually believe in Satan.  TST is a secular humanist organization, who invokes Satan in the literary sense as a figure who breaks chains and liberates."
OutOfTheLoop,ffcc7lg,t1_ffc64a5,1579796302.0,That depends heavily on what you consider far left nonsense.

OutOfTheLoop,feq8wpl,t1_fen0xdw,1579339001.0,It's an instant turnoff for me.
OutOfTheLoop,feq8teh,t1_fepdk1g,1579338973.0,I mean.. Dude's exaggerating but I do feel like anime has gone way too far in that direction since the 90's with the moe bullshit.
IncelTears,fejaabw,t1_fei99vb,1579163882.0,The just world fallacy is at the heart of a lot of right wing bullshit.
IncelTears,feja8jr,t1_feit9ga,1579163811.0,I mean that's fair but the two are very closely related (for those who use the impending doom as an excuse to be a dick to people.)
