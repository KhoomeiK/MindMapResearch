worldnews,fftl36i,t3_ev4yh2,1580223325.0,"Of course the US releases a security warning for Huawei. Huawei isn't gonna work with the NSA. They rather the UK contract with Cisco so that the US can spy on them instead. Every network equipment supplier has backdoors. You are going to get spied on one way or another. It's naive to think your privacy is protected because Huawei didn't provide the equipments.

While there are many many reasons to hate Boris Johnson, using Huawei makes the most sense because it's the cheapest. Why spend Taxpayer's money on a more expensive contract for no reason?

EDIT: Cisco was an example. The fact still remains that security backdoors exist for every supplier."
worldnews,ffryic3,t1_ffravom,1580168809.0,"You need to stop projecting. For someone who keeps spamming about strawman, you sure make a lot of strawmen yourself. When did I say Greta was wrong factually? When did I say IPCC report is not realistic? 

Do note that you were the first to point out her age. I do not consider her age relevant. You were the one who first brought up that she is 17 and forced me into discussing her age. Now you're considering that a strawman argument I made? 

You're totally ridiculous. Look I get it. You're heart's in the right place. But you're full of emotion and lacking in logic. You only see things in a binary fashion. Have you considered that it is in fact possible for a person to both support climate change and be critical of Greta Thunberg at the same time?"
worldnews,ffqvj09,t1_ffqtobj,1580144596.0,"I did not say a 17 year old cannot be at the center of a critical issue. I said that you cannot be treated as a 17 year. I hope you get the difference.

I mean she distracted media attention away from the IPCC report which should have been the star of the UN summit.

What do you mean? The IPCC has no proposal for Davos. I know Greta loves to cite the findings of the IPCC report's doomsday forecast. But what has she said about their solutions? There is work being done to make viable alternatives to fossil fuel but nothing that is available right now that is actionable."
worldnews,ffqt2r4,t1_ffqr7ye,1580143005.0,"You can't have it both ways. She can't be the figure of climate change and be excused of criticism for being 17 year old. If she is to be treated as a 17 year old, then she has no business  being the center of such a critical issue. IPCC operates wholly independently of Greta. Nations have been working with IPCC long before and they have their own targets and plans. If anything, Greta's presence at the summit has distracted from the IPCC reports. And Greta's demands at Davos has nothing to do with IPCC."

worldnews,ffqiv0q,t1_ffqfa4r,1580135818.0,Well what are you gonna do about it? Complaining about the current generation not wanting to foot the bill isn't stopping climate change.
worldnews,ffqioao,t1_ffqfogd,1580135673.0,"Exactly! These are the kinds of discussions we need. There is of course a lot of things that still need to be worked out for such a solution. You are suggesting a massive shift in supply chains and logistics. How do we achieve all these things? Consumerist culture needs to be stopped. Tech companies need to stop releasing a new model every year. Products needs to be engineered to last longer and a different approach to monetization need to be implemented to keep their profits while manufacturing less.

These are not the things Greta Thunberg talks about."

worldnews,ffqb95t,t1_ffqarks,1580129039.0,"She certainly has helped get the conversation going. She just has a very annoying tone for someone who has avoided getting into anything actionable. It's like a manager who sets impossible targets and shouts at the staff for not meeting it.

At the end if the day, bunch of people talking about it on social media is not making the planet any cooler. This isn't a political issue like abortion and gun control. This is a technical problem. Just saying solve climate change isn't getting us there."

worldnews,ffq9m0b,t1_ffq7x30,1580127223.0,"Has she actually pinpointed anything? Do you understand how vague it is to say ""listen to the scientists""? Can you imagine someone in a board room meeting going ""we should listen to the scientists"" and just stopping there? The solution is not a one liner. It's a massive endeavour that includes pinpointing the right technologies to use and steps for transitioning into these technologies.

Help these people along in how to get to a greener future. What she's saying translates to is it's my future but you go do all the work for it."
worldnews,ffq97r5,t1_ffq7lfi,1580126749.0,You are exactly what I'm describing. You can only pinpoint problems. What's the solution? Poverty is an issue in places like China and India NOW. A bill down the road is a problem down the road. How are you solving that? All you are doing is complaing. Transitioning away from petroleum is not something you can overnight.

worldnews,ffq2eer,t3_euiozs,1580116633.0,"I really would like to see her actually propose solutions instead of making impossible demands. Petroleum is still more economic than the green alternatives.

She is worried about her future and rightfully so. Climate change is going to be a major challenge for her generation. But the issue is she is expecting someone else to find the answers for her. While climate change denial is an issue, most  people in positions of power is aware of the issue. What they are not aware of are solutions to the issue. It's not about there just being green alternatives it's about green alternatives that are economic. There are people living in poverty and that is a more immediate problem to them than climate change. They don't care to see their cost of living go up from switching away from petroleum."
hearthstone,ffl6zmf,t1_ffi3dj1,1580035686.0,"I don't even know why I am bothering to reply when this sub is full of toast apologists. I am not rewriting history. I'm only stating facts. 

Fact number 1: Toast agreed to do a card reveal.
Fact number 2: Blizzard announced in their timetable that Toast will be doing a review.
Fact number 3: Toast did not do his reveal

All you are trying to do is make a justification as to why Toast did not reveal the card. That does not change the facts of the matter.

And as far as justification go, a single reddit thread is hardly a reason to back out of a card reveal. It's an unprofessional thing to do. He already agreed to reveal the card. It was already on the timetable. At that point, he has a responsibility to reveal the card. As result of the reddit thread backlash, he could choose to not accept any further card reveals in the future. He should not go back on an agreement he already made because of it. The timetable continued to have Toast on the schedule for a card reveal which of course ended up not happening."
