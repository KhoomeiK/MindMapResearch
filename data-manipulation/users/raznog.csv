frequently cooking acidic foods in aluminum pots may expose a person to higher levels of aluminum than a person who generally consumes unprocessed foods and uses pots made of other materials (e.g., stainless steel or glass). However, aluminum levels found in processed foods and foods cooked in aluminum pots are generally considered to be safe.


Why does it bother so many people that I, and others, decide it’s not worth taking the risk when there is no benefit. 

I get the chances of it being a problem are low, and we don’t believe it to be an issue right now. But why bother taking the risk when it’s so easy to not cook with aluminum. There is literally no downside to not using aluminum to cook with."
Ultralight,ff999o7,t1_ff9178u,1579707782.0,"As I stated. It doesn’t say it should be avoided. It says it is one way we are exposed. As of right now they don’t believe the levels you get from cookware is dangerous. All of this I have stated numerous times. 

It is possible lower levels than we believe to be dangerous can have adverse affects. I am just being cautious. 

Again I’ll state my rationale. 


Too much aluminum is dangerous, we can’t know exactly where adverse affects start. We can know an amount that is definitely a problem. But can’t be 100% that less isn’t also a problem. 

We know using aluminum cookware adds to your aluminum exposure. I’m not claiming it adds enough to be dangerous on its own. But because it adds to it is possible to push someone from safe to dangerous levels. 

Let’s say 10 units are dangerous and aluminum cookware gives you 1 unit. And you get 9 units from other sources. Now a non dangerous source is pushing you to dangerous limits. 

Now those are just made up numbers but to make a point. Because it’s all additive every source matters. A million tiny sources all at once are just as bad as a single large source. 

So we come to aluminum cookware. It has the potential to add to your total aluminum exposure. There is no benefit to using it over other pieces of cookware. 

So we have a very tiny chance it can be harmful with no plus. So I don’t use it. 

There are other sources of aluminum exposure I do use because the benefit is great. So remove those sources where the benefit is negligible even if the exposure is also small. Because why bother taking the risk when there is no upside."
Ultralight,ff8yds3,t1_ff8xmmo,1579700030.0,"The CDC and EPA says that not using aluminum cookware is one way to limit aluminum exposure. They also say exactly what I’ve said. It’s probably not going to cause a problem on it’s own. But it’s not fully known what issues aluminum can cause since such things are fairly impossible to know. 

So knowing all of this, too much Aluminum exposure is bad, one way we are exposed is cookware, we don’t have a full understanding if there are negative consequences to lower exposure levels, it seems fairly prudent to avoid aluminum in places where it has little benefit over other options. 

Not using aluminum and instead using SS in everyday cooking and titanium on the trail literally has no downside over aluminum. 

So we have aluminum which could help push someone into dangerous levels. Or stainless steel or titanium which isn’t dangerous at all. Call me stupid for limiting exposure when there is no downside. That’s fine. Doesn’t really bother me. I’ll still choose not to take risks if there is no benefit."
AppalachianTrail,ff8uxes,t1_ff7ax3o,1579696943.0,"Hah, I was about to say how surprised I was that there was two of these in virginia. And it looks just like the one by apple orchard falls."
Ultralight,ff8u381,t1_ff85icf,1579696118.0,Yes.
Ultralight,ff8u20s,t1_ff7q60x,1579696082.0,"CDC has info on aluminum toxicity. It’s fairly hard to get enough to cause problems, for what we know right now. 

One of the ways they say can help to mitigate aluminum intake is not to use aluminum cookware. 

We are exposed to aluminum all over the place. So I figure avoiding aluminum cookware is easy, it has no negative impact, so it’s an obvious choice to start with for lowering exposure."
Ultralight,ff8twzz,t1_ff85amj,1579695939.0,"Yes I understand it is everywhere. Which is exactly why I limit it in places where it is easy. 

If an amount is dangerous(which it is) and we are exposed to it in many places, as many keep pointing out. Does it not seem prudent to limit it where there is no drawback? Toxicity is all about dose. So limiting areas where exposure can occur makes it harder to hit toxic levels. Cookware is an absurdly easily place to remove aluminum.  It has 0 drawbacks and doesn’t negatively impact life at all. It is a fairly reasonable and easy place to remove exposure."
Ultralight,ff84kmk,t1_ff7q2u9,1579665822.0,"That’s fine, even the CDC says one way to limit excess aluminum is to avoid cooking with it. They also mention how the risk of having excess aluminum is very low and the excess would probably come from elsewhere. But the way I see it Is let’s say I am accidentally getting more than I should. Some of that could be offset by not getting it from another source. So cut out the sources that don’t negatively impact me at all and continue on like normal."
Ultralight,ff84e5h,t1_ff7m70v,1579665683.0,"Correct. I don’t spend my life trying to avoid aluminum everywhere I go. But if I can limit it in a way that doesn’t negatively impact me in the slightest why not do it? I am well aware that current medical science thinks it requires quite a bit to have negative impacts. And a good way to prevent excess of something is to consume less of it. 

I’m not some nut job thinking big aluminum is out to kill us. It just seems prudent that cooking with a restive toxic metal should be avoided when possible. 

Again, low risk low reward. Might as well not take the risk when the alternative is no different other than the slight risk isn’t there."
Ultralight,ff843dw,t1_ff7m2it,1579665455.0,Correct. And excess aluminum is dangerous. So doesn’t it seem rational to avoid adding extra when it’s easy to do? Not using aluminum cookware has no downside. Using it has a potential downside.
Ultralight,ff7j31n,t1_ff7ir26,1579650733.0,"Well, I don’t eat hot pockets. 

Aluminum in too high quantities can be toxic. While it’s very unlikely you will have any toxicity issues from aluminum cookware, I prefer to just avoid extra sources of aluminum just in case. There are other options available that are definitely safe I don’t see the point in using one that might be an issue, even though the chances are small. I just prefer not to gamble."

Ultralight,ff6vrh9,t1_ff6lw00,1579635884.0,Fair enough. I like to try to balance the risk reward bit. If the risk is minimal and the reward is great I’ll go with it. If the risk is minimal and the reward is also minimal I skip it.
