discworld,ffa03nf,t3_esdbq9,1579725175.0,">Where is Detritus for example? Reg Shoe? Dorfl or Wee Mad Arthur? DEATH?

Death maybe, but I wouldn't bet on any of the others except *maybe* a living Reg Shoe since John Keel has been cast. It seems they've cut the main cast only to human actors and no CGI/Costume characters to save budget.

>Is Angua still a werewolf?

Probably. She's described as having a secret. 

>Does Sybil still breed swamp dragons? 

Impossible to say for sure. She's still a noble so she could still have an expensive hobby besides vigilantism. There's a set photo released that shows her in a confrontation with a person who is on fire, so that could be evidence of dragons or just coincidence. 

>Cheery has been re-imagined as a human, are dwarfs still a thing? 

Dwarves exist per Carrot's stated back-story but been no indication there'll be any on-screen.

>Vampires? Gargoyles? Vetinari's rodent spies? Igors? Nobby?

0 indication we will see any of them. As stated above they appear to be sticking to human actors, so Vampire would be the only one in the budget seemingly.

>Goblins are now human sized and capable of wielding shotgunscrossbows. Electric lamps are now used and are for sale in markets. What's with all the jackets? Is that a fan? Is that an electric kettle?

If I had to guess I'd say the wardrobe and set designed raided thrift stores all actoss J-Burg because once again I guess they didn't have the budget for a full medieval/renaissance costume and set budget. I'm guessing the steam-cum-diesel-cum-junkyardpunk aesthetic has a lot to do with them buying whatever 'old' second hand junk they could find and their crafts department could slap some leather or brass paint on to make it look old-timey. They maybe got lazy when putting down visual clutter in backgrounds and just threw down inappropriate things like electric appliances.


>Is Vimes actually going to use his dis-organiser now? Is Gooseberry going to be replaced with CSI style holo-images and reconstructions?

0 information on this but considering their lack of interest in the source material I wouldn't bet on this. 

>And perhaps most importantly of all, will Sam Vimes still be able to do his thin-boot-sole and cobblestone trick?

It's fine for them to believe that for themselves. I don't think it's fine for them to require others to live by that system. That's why we fight so hard to keep ISIS off our shores, right? So we don't have to live by their absurd religious fundamentalist believes? 

I don't think Card gets a pass for his just because his prophet was a white guy."

Seems that his concept is pretty much just the voucher system we implemented under Bush. 

The one that's turning out to suck.

To me it looks like standard libertarian claptrap, ""Oh once there's a market for schools they'll all compete to be the bestest and get your business and your kids will get better educations!"" 

As if there aren't shitty private schools or colleges all over this country that still stay in business."

He was left with nothing but an obsession. So now he goes planet to planet wiping out half of each world whether it's necessary or not. and not just half of all humans, but half of all life. Even the life that is useful for keeping the planet in balance, like bacteria or trees or bats or bees. 

Do you remember the backstory for Drax? Thanos killed his family when he attacked his planet the old-fashioned way. And yet when Thanos snapped, Drax died too. Even though his planet had already been halved. Because it was never about saving worlds.

He wanted other people to suffer."
