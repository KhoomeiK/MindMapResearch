Heads up: it’s much more time consuming in the beginning but this is the same as using plastic nappies...they poo so much in the beginning but it’s get much much easier very soon after that. Have fun! 

Also, wishing you all the best for your birth plan! I gave birth in a midwife led centre and I had the most empowering experience. I’m in the UK and the NHS actually encourage everyone to use a midwife led centre now unless they’re considered high risk. 

Your plans might also change but that’s ok too - whatever works for you all at the time is the birth story you were meant to have!"
ZeroWaste,ffglctt,t1_fff5ajj,1579908903.0,"A [small coffee chain near me](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-47629820) did this in 2018 and they’ve kept to their word - they’ve lost a fair amount of money but what’s admirable is they’re accepting accountability and admitted that change has to come from a higher level. 

However, they do amazing food which will probably kept them afloat until others follow suit. 

I’m sure it’s in incredible gamble but good for you for exploring your options! Whatever you choose to do, seek comfort that you’re doing more than most just by looking into it."
televisionsuggestions,ffdfvf0,t3_et05jg,1579820011.0,"Nathan Barley is an absolute corker of a show - early stuff written by Charlie Brooker, the guy behind Black Mirror.

Oh and Black Mirror if you’ve not already watched it. 

Inside No. 9 is great if you can access it - not sure where you’re based. 

Happy Valley is fantastic. 

I really enjoyed Halt and Catch Fire but might not be everyone’s cup of tea."
houseplants,ffcqnsw,t1_ffcpem5,1579805224.0,"Hmmmmm the only leaf to have come out since I bought it was yellow and brown - I assumed it was because of the change of environment! 

Guess I’ll just keep an eye on it and try not to touch it too much. Stressful times!"
plantclinic,ffc5o0q,t1_ffc4t0d,1579792110.0,"This is all very interesting, thank you! Good to know about that test as well. 

I love this sub."
plantclinic,ffc5gjz,t1_ffc4u6c,1579791970.0,Ah that’s really reassuring thank you. I’ll keep an eye on it and stop worrying so much!
plantclinic,ffc2cuh,t1_ffc18rx,1579789797.0,"Ah that’s a relief - I commented on another post that had MV and they basically said ‘throw it out, it’s dead’ without even seeing it. Phew! 

That leaf is definitely the only leaf that has any type of pattern so I guess I’ll just wait and see! In the meantime I’ll keep it away from other plants and keep saying encouraging things to it. 

Thank you!"
houseplants,ffbxk79,t3_est2nt,1579786001.0,"I’m based in the U.K. and bought this recently.  I recently read that MV is rife in Adansonii’s in Europe at the moment but not sure if I’m just panicking for no reason. 

I’ve asked in r/plantclinic but I figured there would be lots of Adansonii lovers here too. 

TIA!"

HouseplantsUK,ff4dbw4,t1_ff4d61q,1579560923.0,"Will do, thank! Can you quarantine it or is it a goner?"
HouseplantsUK,ff4d1x7,t3_erk7hz,1579560741.0,"Is there a definitive way to identify it? And is it airborne or does it spread by contact? 

I’m not actually sure if any of my plants have it but one of them has a suspicious yellow blob and a lot of my other plants are from the same small plant shop.

Edit: and thanks for the PSA!"
YouShouldKnow,ff43a2o,t1_ff3z4gr,1579554598.0,"Well I didn’t think I’ve ever recommend the Westal Green petrol station as a tourist attraction but while you’re in the area, there’s a rare [Penfold](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillar_box#Penfolds) post box across the road - that’s an interesting landmark! 

Finish it off with a trip to the Gloucester Services and you’ll have enough to write a postcard home about."
YouShouldKnow,ff3ygyg,t1_ff3pfr3,1579551606.0,It’s in Cheltenham - the only proof I can find is when it’s mentioned halfway down an article where someone was stabbed nearby. [Enjoy!](https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/cheltenham-news/live-police-incident-texaco-garage-2121258)
