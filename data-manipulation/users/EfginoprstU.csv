AmItheAsshole,fffp6dc,t3_etdqhh,1579888780.0,NAH. I'm a woman but I've had similar jobs and TBH I take pride in the fact that I'm good at engaging with kids in that way. This kind of behavior should be encouraged.
relationship_advice,ffe50n1,t3_et4lss,1579836865.0,I was blocked. It was harsh but especially on stuff like Facebook where you can still see their interactions with mutual friends it's definitely the best option.
college,ffdf4lr,t3_et07hx,1579819565.0,Haha this kind of thing is totally up my alley. Glad you're having fun with it. :D
AmItheAsshole,ffb6jkr,t3_esnzs0,1579753133.0,NTA. I personally don't think they're inherently bad but you're definitely not a strange person for not wanting it.
AmItheAsshole,ffatnhb,t3_esloeb,1579744224.0,I definitely want to say YTA post-clarification. It seems incredibly unfair that you'd go out of your way to give her a bad grade when you yourself were intent on making sure she didn't have a job to do. How exactly could she have prevented that?
relationship_advice,ffara7d,t3_eslpep,1579742646.0,"You don't *have* to break up with him, but you probably should. At the very least, you shouldn't rest until this problem is solved and he doesn't do that stuff anymore. Because he shouldn't be doing it, full stop."
ApplyingToCollege,ffa2814,t3_eshvvx,1579726415.0,"Nope. I switched from AP Calc to regular Calc after being accepted and there was no conflict, so I'm sure just switching to a different AP will be fine."
relationships,ff7ruvm,t3_es4oro,1579656840.0,"Ugh, no, I don't think you're over sensitive. That sounds really annoying to have to put up with."
college,ff6v0tl,t3_erzos9,1579635455.0,"Well, technically I minored in something similar, but...it was my home. The fact is that I never really fit in with the people in my major/career, but the fact that I at least *had* somewhere that I belonged was incredibly important. Because before I discovered it I didn't think I belonged anywhere whatsoever. And it's important for people to have that experience."
relationship_advice,ff6qj6h,t3_erytg2,1579632784.0,"It's really not that small of a problem. You have straightforward evidence that a serious conversation isn't enough to get him to understand, and that he's going to exploit your vulnerabilities for his entertainment, as you said. And that's not okay."
relationship_advice,ff6itt3,t3_erxysp,1579628121.0,Your parents' argument really doesn't have any ground to stand on. It might be difficult but I think you should go for it.
AmItheAsshole,ff53vyj,t3_erp5se,1579579516.0,NTA. It's honestly ridiculous for them to argue that you should quit your habits because it makes them feel insecure.
AmItheAsshole,ff4o916,t3_ermvim,1579568437.0,"NAH, although you maybe should have asked first. If I had been her I would have really enjoyed that but it definitely makes sense why she wouldn't have."
college,ff3p2tz,t1_ff1vop3,1579545802.0,"You really never know what can happen. Some of the above progress was gradual, but it was a single specific event right before spring break that really, finally set my college life in motion. 

I get that academics are an issue for you, but...if you have any space in your schedule you might want to consider a minor. The bottom line for me is that I never really fit in with my major department, and that would be a struggle throughout all of college but it got a lot easier when I connected with the students and professors who were involved in my minor department--because at least then I *had* a place to go where I belonged."
Advice,ff1yics,t3_er6vfp,1579489112.0,Not denying that I totally relate to your mindset and I've had basically the same process. But wouldn't actually condone anything other than therapy either.
college,ff1vjtb,t3_er52nj,1579487137.0,"Agree that early on is a bit early to tell. I'd say each half-semester during my first year was progressively better; I was basically at a 1/10 in terms of overall functioning/satisfaction until October, a 2/10 until December, then up to a whopping 4/10 from January to March, but by the time I had finished my freshman year I was pretty much at a 7/10. So there's definitely time for things to get better. :)"
Advice,feyv1a1,t3_eqy7md,1579450874.0,"I had the same thing (from your side) with someone who really is a close friend of mine now, if it helps. But yeah, you definitely need some time with no contact. And you should use that time to expand your social circle, platonically or otherwise."
TwoXChromosomes,fetu00k,t3_eqkt28,1579380065.0,"Hm, not really. Not since 8th - 11th grade. In 12th grade and throughout college I remember having multiple subgroups of friends, a lot of which had guys and girls."
AmItheAsshole,fetq5oi,t3_eqlckn,1579378274.0,"As someone who's still kinda learning not to be like her, NTA. Time and place, you know?"
TwoXChromosomes,fesztjx,t3_eqjoc7,1579370501.0,"Your relationship to alcohol sounds basically the same as mine, right down to the main effect being silliness. But it doesn't sound like much more than banter to me."
college,fep7l0p,t3_eq9xwz,1579313922.0,I definitely miss it. I had two roommates my freshman year; one of them we didn't really talk to but I had a major love-hate relationship with the other which would become a genuinely great friendship for the last three years once we had our space. I had a single for the other three years but I still loved the general experience.
TwoXChromosomes,fenf556,t1_fena3ht,1579283354.0,And Zero/Hector! I adore both of them tbh.
TwoXChromosomes,fej7ovg,t3_epf3oc,1579160390.0,Nice! My first one wasn't intentional but it did open up a new world! (I'd already been masturbating for a couple months but I was in denial about it until then haha)
ApplyingToCollege,fehh9a3,t3_ep6trm,1579116497.0,"""The piercing silence of our third grade talent show"" is way better, I think, but it depends on what sentences came before it. The second half sounds fine."
TwoXChromosomes,feb70bw,t3_eobp0n,1578955999.0,"I probably only post selfies a few times a year, but when I do I definitely put work into them. But I enjoy it--it's kind of like a game or puzzle or art project to me."
