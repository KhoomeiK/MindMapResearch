Cloud cover could be everything from nothing to full, and snow is a bit of a role of the dice. Weather in Bergen is... Not very stable at the beat of times ;) 

The trip is nice, and not very challenging as long as the weather is OK. I assume you know something about hiking, so as long as you dress properly you'll be fine. There's cellphone/4g coverage more or less the whole trip.

Edit: if you arrive to a crisp, cloudless spring day it will be a great walk. If it's poring down its not really worth it.."

This has been proven several times to not be actual problem. There has been _some_ arsons. It's still an extremely dry and long bushfire season. And there's been plenty of lightningstrikes and other things starting the fires other than criminals. Stop repeating the brain dead politicians and Twitterbots like a useful parrot.
