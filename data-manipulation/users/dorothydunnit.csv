Its not just a matter of being ""sexist"" per se, but of gossiping in public like that. Its unseemly and reflects poorly on the club.

When executive members are heard judging other kids for whatever reason, it defeats the purpose of having a club - and turns it into a clique for the kids who meet the ""in-crowd's"" standards.

I don't know if you can punish the guys but do point out that people heard what they said,  they're making themselves look like jerks in front of other students, and they are embarrassing the club. If they really feel a need to talk like that, they need to do it in a private setting."

AmItheAsshole,fgn4clf,t1_fgmj0jf,1580937468.0,"There are different approaches, so if you're looking into this for yourself, you can try different therapists and see what seems to work best for you.

A lot of it is about identifying the emotions or thoughts and learning how to manage them. Like, if you keep telling yourself, ""I can't do this"" the idea is to catch yourself and deal with it some way (like replacing it with a positive thought, which might involve redefining the goals you set for yourself).

Mindfullness is another thing that's often recommended. That's more where do relaxation or refocus your attention to address the feeling of fear. This is related to another approach called ""Self-compassion"" (you can google Kristen Neff). Its where you learn to nurture yourself.

Some therapists might want to dig deeper and help you process the experiences that started making you feel that insecurity or anxiety.

If you're looking for a self-help thing, I suggest googling Procrastination and/or Positive Psychology. A lot of the writers are saying similar things - the difference is that sometimes they way someone says it really hits home.

I have worked in the area of prevention with younger children. For example, we try to get teachers to validation for children when they try something and it doesn't work out, as opposed to just praising them when they do well. Also, if the child is prone to anxiety in general, teaching them mindfullness and relaxation is helpful. If you're thinking about a child, you can google mindfullness for children. 

A lot of people assume the child is being lazy, but the underlying issue is that they've learned to avoid things in order to manage their anxiety. The longer the avoidance works for them, the worse it gets. In regular classrooms, gifted children can avoid a lot of the work and still get high marks,  so that's why it doesn't get picked up until they get to senior high school or university.

Hope this helps."

The OP should suggest discuss her daughter's tendency to give-up on things and suggest that some counselling would likely help her, as this is something that will affect her in her adult life. An reason she could give the daughter would be to help her analyze her own strengths and weaknesses to set the best career goals for herself. A good psychologist would likely pick up on her fear of failure and talk her into getting treatment for it.

A red flag for me is  that the OP tries to tell us the boy didn't realize dresses are for girls only, and said the parent should have told him.  I really doubt any kid that age would say that.

Research consistently shows that kids are well aware of the more obvious gender signifiers before they go to school. Unless he's been living under a rock, this kid would have seen princess dresses associated with girls - in stores, in children's books, in videos and cartoons, toy stores, playing with friends, etc. etc.  He might still want to wear it, but he wouldn't be thinking in terms of  ""my parent shouldn't told me."""

Reading the comments here is pretty consistent with what I've read about the strength of  sibling grief being overlooked by others, particularly a twin.  It  can be at least as hard as losing a spouse.

Logically, I can see your point that you'll only be gone a short time, will be in constant touch, and can come back if something starts to happen. Plus, your wife will be with family so even if she goes into labour, someone can be there to reassure her and to advocate for her in the hospital. Its not like you'd be abandoning her.

But the issue for you is going to be that you will be perceived by your wife to be the asshole and she will not forget this. I mean, even if she doesn't go into labour while you're gone, she will stress about it and you'll feel the brunt of it long after the baby's born.'

The only things I can think of would be if her family supports you and talks to her. she might still be pissed off at you but if they take your side, she'd probably let go of it over time. Or, could you take someone with you to drive so you can get back in those 3 hours if anything starts to happen? 

I wish I could think of a solution. Regardless of what you decide, I hope you have access to grief counselling as soon as possible. This is a huge loss and it will really help if you have someone outside of your family to talk to about it."

Your Mom is in the habit of making all your decisions and its going to be a process of her letting-go.

Or instead of just asking her to stop, you could have said, ""You mention your weight a lot, and even though I don't see an issue, its obviously bothering you a lot. Has it reached a point where you're thinking about getting help?""

Also, you say she told everyone what you said, but I'm sure they noticed your tone and then saw her face fall. They knew you said something rude and asked her what it was, so don't blame her for telling them.

And they can refer you to a counsellor who can teach you how to overcome the ""I can't pee on a plane"" kind of feeling.  Usually they do it by having you imagine the scenario and do progressive relaxation exercises.  If you google parusis you can find more info and see how common it is.

If a dog's mobility is really limited, it eventually affects their overall health because his muscles and organs and such aren't getting the movement they need (unless he's getting physio, etc.).  So, my guess is that the vet would advise you to have him put down, unless you can afford whatever it takes to treat him.   The vet could also let you know if there is any organization that might find a new home for him (the answer is likely no but at least then you've covered your bases).

In this case, obviously the father can't explain so they would likely keep it closed long enough for GF to get power of attorney.

Can you talk to your Dad about this? Your Mom might not listen to you or your Dad. If not, does she have brothers or sisters you can contact? Friends? Her family doctor? These are just a few suggestions as to who she might listen to.

Or, is there a counsellor at your school or a teacher you feel comfortable talking to? They could make up an excuse to call your Mom or even visit her and then use that as a chance to offer to connect her with some help.

I hope you can explain this to your sister so she understands, too, and can come up with some ideas or help you get help.

You would also benefit from having someone to talk to. When you look after a parent and siblings, the long term effects can be that you find it hard to draw boundaries. Boundaries like whether or not you are responsible for your Mom or she's responsible for you.  Its natural to be mixed up when you've been living in this unusual situation. This is also a reason for you to see if you can access a counsellor through your school or doctor. Or sometimes just talking to a supportive adult can help.  In other words, be sure to look after yourself.

Basically, you worry that people will be judging you for not being good enough.

If you do this with your own family, even worse, they will be worried about you judging them as not good enough as you get to know them.

For example, they will be hesitant to invite you to their home because they're embarrassed its not good enough. Or else they won't want to invite you out because they'll assume you won't like the dinner they can afford.

You might already know this, but when cats rub up against a person, thing, or another cat, that is a bonding move. They do it to blend their smell on to you. . That blended smell is  how cats recognize their friends and family. If the cat is rubbing on you, that is a sign  the cat is coming around, so I can't think of anything else to suggest,  other recognize small signs of progress. Maybe, over time, you'll find how the right angle and approach for petting is acceptable to this cat (most cats prefer under the chin or on the cheeks, rather than being approached from above - but you probably know that). 

I hope your older cat gets used to the new one, as that will really help. Do you give the older one a treat when the new one rubs against him or comes close? That might help him relax with the little one, might not, but its worth a try. 

To help you feel more affection to the cat,  you could try is remind yourself of what a survivor this kitten is, having been a semi-feral survivor. She must have a lot of guts, bravery, smarts somewhere inside of her. (I adopted a semi-feral cat once so Know the feeling of resenting them, but when I reminded myself to admire him for his instincts, that really helped)

If the shelter said they'll take the cat back, I wouldn't blame you for asking, because its not your fault if the kitten had needs you weren't prepared to deal with. I think the shelter might be a bit of an AH here but if they're overstressed and volunteer, I guess we can't expect the most of them."

Share with your friend that you were like Noah when you were little. Its going to be a fine line to do this without seeming to tell them what to do, but you can plant implicit suggestions by your examples.

And/or, if your friends talk about Noah, ask them more about what they have done/tried, etc. Again, try to steer clear of telling them what to do. It would be more like. ""Have you thought about..."" or ""what would happen if you""  more like you're curious than acting like you know better.

You could also encourage them to get some professional advice. Not like ""to improve your parenting,"" but more like ""This must be hard...""

The main thing here is to get them talking so you can learn more about why the are doing what they are doing, and then approach suggestions accordingly.

He couldn't tell Lauren he was her father, not even after her parents died, because that scene would have been unpleasant for him. His wife and his kids would have judged him, he would have had to face their pain and go through the pain himself and he was too much of a coward to face that.

You're not considering Lauren here. She never felt denied Its not like he abandoned her. She grew up with two parents who, for all we know, were very loving. Telling her that her Dad, the one who raised her, is not her real ""Dad"" would have had huge implications for her ability to grieve and remember him, and it would have been devastating for her to learn her mother had been part of this lie. When the OP's father was well,  he had the choice to clear his conscience but that would have potentially upended Laurent's life as well as his wife and kids. He was in a no-win situation because of something stupid he did years ago. He also would have gone against the explicit promise he made to Lauren's own mother and her real Dad (the one who raised her).

My guess is that his being her father really affected him when her parents died, because he wanted to tell her ""Don't worry, you still have a parent in me"" but he couldn't.

Then, just before he died,   he would have known it was his last chance to make things right for Lauren by letting her know how much he loved her all along and to reassure her she has more family than she thinks.  The issue is that he *wasn't thinking clearly enough* to consider how he might do this, without upsetting Lauren and  affecting everyone else. I bet his brain just went from Point A to Point B without processing all the implications in between.

I think it would be fair to treat this more as a deathbed confessional than a rational request.

I do get that you're angry at your Dad but I think he deserves a lot of credit for wanting to do right by Lauren. No, he shouldn't have left you with this, but he must have had a lot of respect for your judgement by telling you (not that he was thinking logically at the time, but an instinct kicked in ""OP will know what to do.).

I really disagree with people who jump to the conclusion your Dad was an asshole. Yes, he had an affair, but humans are flawed creatures and we all screw up in one way or another.  It must have been really hard for him to respect Lauren's mother's request to keep this quiet, and he did put her needs above his own. He also agreed with the understanding that Lauren would be well cared for.  I am sure he's paid a price for the affair in his head many times over.  I hope you can take comfort in knowing that he was an honourable man to the end, albeit a human one.

If you felt a need to be true to the underlying meaning of your Dad's last request, it might not be so much the money, as reaching out to Lauren and standing by her as much as you can (within reason) if she ever needs support, especially reminding her she has family in you who love her. And when you're talking about your Dad, let her know he always thought she was special.

AmItheAsshole,fekdp7f,t1_fek65te,1579197885.0,"The way your son is acting is common in kids who are prone to perfectionism and anxiety. When something feels too hard, they quit because they've learned over time that is what helps them avoid the anxiety. On the surface,, they don't look anxious, because they've become good at avoiding it They just look lazy and apathetic to others because they are avoiding whatever will make them anxious.

Some psychologists say this is becoming a cultural phenomenon because it is so common for parents to want to shelter kids from hardship and make sure they have everything, etc. Its not your fault, I'm just saying you're not alone.

Its tempting to nag and cajole these kids into doing things but that can backfire it it just makes them feel more anxious and retreat further into their avoidance. Its the same with withholding social things are punishment. The less they do, the less they accomplish and the less they feel confidant, and then its a downward spiral. Also, trying to motivate him can backfire if he hears ""you're not good enough..."" (you might not say it, but he can still think that's what you mean).

Something a lot of laypeople don't know is that ""motivation"" requires ""efficacy' That's a sense that either you can do it (confidence), or if you can't do it,  its okay to try and fail (resilience)  That's what I think your son might need ( based on what you are saying). It is like a combination of  confidence and resilience. You say your son can work hard when he ""likes"" something, but its not just a matter of liking it, its a matter of feeling he can tackle it.

I suggest you ask your therapist to recommend a joint counsellor for you and your son. A counsellor can help broker the discussion between you and your son so you can give him the reassurance he needs, and at the same time help implement goals *he sets for himself.*  Or maybe a counsellor for your son himself.

Some other things you can try:

1. Have you spoken to a school counsellor? If they know you are involved and concerned, they will usually go the extra mile. Like, greeting him when he gets to school or getting his favourite teacher to greet him and give him positive feedback for coming. Sometimes even a little ""I will see you tomorrow!"" makes a difference to a kid feeling he has to do something. Some teachers will even ask the kid to come in early to help with something around the school, or maybe they have a project where the high schoolers help in a seniors home.
2. You mentioned the lizards. Is there any way to build on that interest? Would he be interested in volunteering at the local animal shelter? a pet store or zoo?  Or is there a herpetology club in your area?
3. Are there senior neighbours in your area that could do with some volunteer work from him mowing their lawn or running errands, or something?
4. Is he getting physical activity? That's one thing that's always recommended for anxiety and depression.
5. Do you do much together? Someone else posted about having the kid help around the house. You could make him do chores but what if you cook together, or fix stuff or anything else?

I am suggesting working with and for others, because it is a good confidance builder to know you are valued and needed by others.

These are just some ideas about getting him off his butt with some positive, confidence building things to do. I also suggest that you actively include him in all the decisions as much as possible. This is what I think a cognitive behavourist would suggest. But they would be better at him playing an active role in the goal setting. Plus, they can help your son with relaxation and visualization, etc. to help him relax as he tackles more difficult stuff at a pace that works for him.

4. When you proceed, don't imply ""I'm doing this because I need the mark."" Make it more like, ""This policy needs to be clarified for everyone."" That's more diplomatic and comes across as more professional.

What you can do is think of a way to explain this kind of culture to her.   Something like ""I should caution you that we're highly focused on ourselves during our workouts and are not sociable, so if we don't pay any attention to you, don't take it personally. That's the way it works in those sessions."" Or something like that."

but if  I were you, I'd send him a short email to say thanks for the meeting and his help. Then say sorry you didn't bring hard copies, and you would definitely do so next time. Also, tell him thanks for alerting you to the fact that the copy you found online was not posted by the author or publisher.

This is more just to reassure him of your good intentions keep the peace with the guy.

When digital devices in classrooms were fairly new, I had students deliberately tell me ""I want you to know I'm not texting - I take notes on my phone..."" I thought that was a nice courtesy,  just so I'd know they were engaged more than they looked. In hindsight, maybe they said it so their classmates would know, too.

Another LPT for students: Some students do send a quick thank you after a meeting. Its not expected but it does create a good impression."

>If someone calls APS on her she will have to be alerted to try to save things from the house (as it will be condemned and she will be sent to live elsewhere.) In this time I fear that she will become very upset, and cut us out of her life.

I'm not sure how the process works, but I would think they would assign someone as her conservator and that person would check with her next of kin (ie. her children)  and remove  anything from the house that is worth saving. They would just have to make sure its removed safely.   Maybe you should call your local APS and ask them what the steps will be. You might also want to check on r/legaladvice .

Your local  APS might also be able to ease your mind that they don't have to say anyone in the family phoned. I'm sure they would keep it anonymous.

I don't think you really have a choice, here. If she stays, she'll get sicker and pass away, and you'll be kicking yourself that you didn't call APS. If, on the other hand, she goes into care, she might be miserable at first, but she's already miserable so it can't be worse. And  she'll probably get used to it and there is a good chance she'll  like it. She'll certainly be more comfortable physically, as she'll have professionals to move her, help her bathe, etc. She might enjoy the social aspect, too. She might live longer, but even if she its not be much longer, at least you'll know the quality of her life was better than in the house.

The aunt probably needs mental help, too, and maybe this is what she needs to turn her own life around.

You sound like a really good granddaughter. If your grandmother was in her right mind, she'd be really proud of your taking initiative on this."

I would not trust that lady with Golem. Honestly, the way she blames her daughter's love of the cat makes it sound to me like this lady is unbalanced. I doubt she would hurt him, but she's going to start believing Golem is her own.

Make sure you have a screenshot record of the  facebook post to them or other written record of telling them not to feed your cat and not to let it into their home. Add your contact info and tell them to contact you if they think the cat is lost or needs anything. In your post make sure you state these are safety issues for the cat.

AND get a tag for the cat that has ""Do not feed me"" on it (my cousin has one on his cat - not sure where he got it) AND your phone number.

This way you're taking away any excuse they might have for luring your cat, if they are called on it.

And check your local bylaws to see if they are violating any laws. At the very least, it was theft when they took the collar and it might be construed as ""attempt to steal a cat"" if they keep trying to lure it. Your local pet shelter or pet licensing place might have suggestions.

If you haven't already so, you might talk to your vet because there *might* be ways to train her to stay indoors that you haven't tried.  Cats get anxious when their routines are disrupted, so if you do it gradually, that might help. Also, they have sprays and stuff now to calm the cat, so that might help him get used to staying inside. 

EDIT: Original wording implied that the OP might not have tried systematically training the cat to stay indoors (as opposed to just keeping him inside), so I reworded the last paragraph to say that part  was just in case they haven't tried everything that a cat specialist might suggest. I do accept that Gholam's past means he is incorrigible in his outside ways"
