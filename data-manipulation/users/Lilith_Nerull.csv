bipolar,ff65mww,t1_ff5wsm9,1579619710.0,"It does suck.  It isn't fair we've gotta deal with this crap.

Then I remember an important thing.  If I'm not stable, I can't enjoy anything.  So I could have the most interesting, cool life in the world, but I'd be a mess.

I have to keep my life simple so I'm able to enjoy it.

Does suck when my family talks about my ""potential"" though.  That one stings."
bipolar,ff4bjic,t3_erj3a7,1579559761.0,"""Living life to the fullest"" is a phrase I had to stop using.  It became code for ""I should be doing more, but I can't"".

Now I look at it differently.  I say I live the best life I can.

I have a handicap.  It absolutely sucks.  Despite this, I have a good life.  I just happens to be very challenging.

I do my best to make things as stable for myself and those around me.  I keep a job.  I have a husband and pets that I love.  I see my family regularly.

I take pride in these little things and in the small victories I have.  Thus far, it's been enough.

Hope that helps in some way."
bipolar,ff3z74c,t3_erhxi8,1579552065.0,I understand. I can only paint when manic or hypomanic.  Looks awesome regardless.
FondantHate,feh4f57,t3_ep36fe,1579108921.0,Why does her face look so... derpy?
slaythespire,feglsf9,t3_eoufa8,1579096686.0,I love her so much!!  It's really engaging to play her and feels super rewarding.
slaythespire,fee4yax,t3_eons9n,1579026487.0,"Good News: I'm at work and can't play the watcher anyway.

Bad News: I'm at work."
slaythespire,fead99h,t3_eo6x60,1578947201.0,"Every time I get that relic, I take comfort in the fact that'll be gone soon.  Can't wait."
CaregiverSupport,fd9eig1,t3_ekcubw,1578232244.0,"20 years!  I can only imagine the toll that takes.  It takes a strong person to give that much.  I hope you start to find ways to take care of yourself, even if it's only a little.

I'm glad you at least get a small break at the end of this week, at the very least."
CaregiverSupport,fd3rzjq,t1_fd3on1z,1578161168.0,So nice to talk to someone who's relieved as well.
CaregiverSupport,fd3rvjc,t1_fd37y8d,1578161133.0,"Believe it or not, I have one more party today... then it's over!  I'm glad you can commiserate.  It's hard not to feel like a grinch sometimes."
bipolar,fd2u4fn,t3_ejtrn0,1578151685.0,I really liked lamictal until I got a rash.  Had to switch to trileptal and have had great success with that.
slaythespire,fd20x0m,t3_ejpfi8,1578139927.0,"Exciting!  I haven't played the new character at all, so I'm looking forward to learning how she works."
slaythespire,fc2p183,t3_efos6u,1577369681.0,"Congrats!  I'm stuck at ascension 19, but I'll get there!  How long did it take you to beat it?"
