Warthunder,ffdvmwb,t3_et36a9,1579830047.0,"Good Morning y'all

I have here a very interesting vehicle. the M8 Greyhound fitted with a TOW Launcher.

Its relatively self-explanatory, so ill go over the big differences

The main 37mm M6 gun was replaced with a 50. caliber machine gun.

And on top of the tank was a standard TOW ATGM launcher.

Not much is actually known. there was supposedly 6 to 8 such vehicles built in the mid-eighties. 

Why would I add this? 

I don't know... its cool. Its an interesting little vehicle that could be fun as a quick, flank'n'spank tank destroyer. no armor, obviously, but a potentially quite powerful gun.

it could go around 7.0-8.0, not very high, but not low either.

Now the real question would be if this could be in the tech tree or as a premium or event vehicle.

Its graphics are so terrible its hilarious, but its not about the graphics

its a kind-of RPG, sandbox game. You start as a medieval peasant and you work work your way up, building an army, fighting for and against kingdoms and lords until you become the Emperor of all Calradia.

fight among a vast land of warring nations, with a great variety of historically accurate weapons and armor. Mod to your heart's content
