Your suggestion would require tracking down and identifying people that don't have/utilize these services, getting them enrolled in some program, hiring a staff to explain or train people on how to use the cards, and maintaining a staff to answer questions about the program.

changemyview,fd9f2jr,t1_fd853fe,1578232534.0,"Just figured I'd mention, but the probable reason for the ""homophobic"" language of the Bible probably exists for the same reason that you see ancient laws against sodomy. Cleanliness. The Jews in particular have historically been noted for having pretty rigid hygienic practices. Although we enjoy modern luxuries when it comes to anal sex like douching, condoms, lubricant, antibiotics if you should contract an illness (remember, this is a time when people died ALL THE TIME from simple infections) and even just general knowledge of the workings of the GI tract, the people of that time did not.  

Anal sex would have unquestionably been a messy business 2-5k years ago, and was probably viewed as a generally unsafe practice. The same can realistically be stated for oral sex at the time as well. Since this is literally the only way for gay men to have sex, the practice was outlawed. Ancient peoples had a much more pragmatic approach to public health than we have today. If it posed a danger to the health of their society, it was outlawed.  

Just figured I'd mention it because the framing of the Bible's authors as homophobes isn't really accurate. At least not when compared to our modern interpretation of the word. It was quite literally a matter of public health and hygiene and was just dealt with in the same fashion that similar issues were dealt with. A complete ban. Kosher food laws exist for pretty much the same reason. It wasn't just a ""I don't like their lifestyle"" kind of thing.  

Racism during this time really just boils down to tribalism, and in an era when the threat of other tribes coming to your tribe and murdering everyone with swords and spears was a very real threat, you can understand why they would be racist.  

I just think you're not really considering much about what life would have been like for the people at the time the Bible was written.

I like where your head is at on this, but it's really just not true. Medicare/Medicaid budget now accounts for about 1/4 of federal spending. Military spending is around 1/7. A federalization of the healthcare is predicted to cost 2.5-3 Trillion/year from most sources I've seen, Which completely blows the military budget out of the water and is nearly triple the current budget of medicare/Medicaid combined. There really isn't any way around the fact that universal healthcare will cost a shitload of money and will unquestionably lead to tax increases across the board."

Sorry, but I hate this logic. Youre talking about entertainment here, not solar power or water treatment plants. You already have control over whether or not these games get made. If the loot box model is a monetary failure, then the loot box model gets scrapped. Simple as that. If EA wants to make the $999 super awesome M16 throwback skin package, then that's fine too. No one will buy it, they lose money and don't do it again.  You also say it like the current business model is so entrenched that it can't be fixed. Didn't EA just release a Star Wars game with no DLC? What do you want to bet the next Battlefront game has FAR less DLC than BF2 because of the great loot box fiasco there? The complaints are being heard, and they're obviously working to an extent. 

Government intervention is fine for things where consumers have a necessity and have no options. Gaming is not a necessity, and there are thousands of options if you don't like one studio's business model. You should run to uncle Sam and demand government intervention because you can't play as Vader and you really wanted to. Just be a discerning consumer and wait for the changes to come. It may mean you don't get to play all the titles you wanted to, but that's life. It's better than the alternative. At it's core, game development is a form of art, and the government has no business putting their hands near it. We have the freedom of speech and expression for that very reason"

Its like saying all music can be free because some dildo does open mics at your local coffee shop, so there's obviously no reason why AC/DC should ever have to play at a stadium. Scale matters when you're talking about entertainment. So no, you would never get games like Madden or GTAV without profit motive."
ABoringDystopia,fct289s,t1_fcse9ss,1577930975.0,"Okay... But I don't even get what the fucking suggestion of this thread is. All video games are the product of capitalism. How can you say it ""ruined gaming"". Companies have always created games as a form of entertainment to make money. They have recently figured out a new way to make more money. As with all things capitalist, they will try it and if the public rejects it, then they will stop. But aside from that, the more looming question is, what the hell do you propose as an alternative for game development? Government sanctioned/funded video game development? The notion that video games could even exist at all without capitalism is ludicrous. This whole thread is just flat out ridiculous."

The issue of ""when life begins"" is at best, highly subjective. There isn't any ""fact"" to it, because there really isn't anything to be proven.

This article is a completely biased literary analysis and nothing more. It doesn't do anything to further the argument that ""life actually begins at *x*, and not *y*"".
