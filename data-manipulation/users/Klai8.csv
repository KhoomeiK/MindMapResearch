The whole point of the FICA & FIMA were to offset people who didn’t save their income via the younger generational inflated incomes. 

However, it’s absurd to me that I’ll get taxed on capital gains on a Roth IRA or 401k and then hit with an extra 40% if I decide to withdraw a tax shielded 401k. Simple math on compounded interest will tell you that gains of >40% haven’t been realized since the dot com boom.

Local police bypassed the legal warrant procedures thanks to tips by the feds.

As it was explained to us in school, the warrant gives them authority to search for **one specific thing** with reasonable suspicion and a judge’s authority per the 4th amendment.
 e.g. the cops can have a warrant to find guns in your house but can do nothing about the pile of cocaine they see laying around unless they go back and get another warrant from the judge.

What is disturbing about these new search and seizure bypasses is that the cop doesn’t need to legally “know” anything but has been tipped off by a wiretapping fed agency. This lets them go on and figure out a bullshit reasons to justify the ends with the means"
