I can't wait to see how switching to an all carbon frame and disc brakes feels compared to my defy's aluminum frame.
cycling,fdt2ayv,t3_emrgrw,1578710993.0,"I ride a Giant Defy that I bought used back in 2014 to work everyday, 24 miles round trip. For you, 40 miles is a lot to put in everyday so keep that in mind, especially if you haven't ridden in a while. Plus carrying a change of clothes, lunch, and any other work essentials adds up. My commute is 45 minutes one way at a casual pace at about 15-18 mph. Not going to lie, but biking 5 days a week, 120+ miles a week does take a toll on your body, especially if you're hunched over on it for an extended period of time. My suggestion is to buy a used bike because if you're worried about crashing, might as well do it on a used bike. A used bike off craigslist for about $500 should suffice. My Giant Defy is an endurance bike and I highly recommend one. It's a not a ""too aggressive"" forward position for those long commutes and a durable aluminum frame."
