Selsun blue extra strength is not available in my country. There are medicated and moisturizing options only. But as long as they contain selenium sulfide, it'll not be a problem I guess.

Thank you!"
SebDerm,fffhafv,t1_fffaxt7,1579883940.0,"Isn't selsun blue a dandruff shampoo? How can you leave it on your hair and face? 

I consume some of the foods you mentioned except fruit juices, soda, candy and chips but I'll try to stay away from the others as well."
SebDerm,ffeot8p,t3_et7iby,1579857897.0,My derm prescribed me an antifungal which does not seem to make my condition worse. It may not help but shouldn't be aggravating it. I think you better stop using it and see a derm for a better treatment.
SebDerm,ffcoa8s,t1_ffch138,1579803700.0,"When I read the side effects I was afraid that if I kept using it I might end up with swollen eyelids. Now I am relieved, thanks!"
SebDerm,ffcf2tn,t1_ffc12tq,1579798085.0,"I'll keep using it then, thank you!"
depression,ff9ve6t,t3_esg44c,1579722328.0,Try to be grateful! People have it worse than you do.
SebDerm,ff8kt97,t3_erqaht,1579683296.0,"I can totally relate. My sebderm started at around the same time. I've already seen 3 different dermatologists and tried a few methods I read here along with the medications I was prescribed to but for now it is spreading. I am trying to consume as less dairy and gluten as possible thinking it may be diet related. Before that I had been a vegetarian for years. My sebderm is mostly red with some flakes in my eyebrows. I am trying to find the root cause but so far has not been successful. It is taking a toll on my already low self esteem. I am a teacher and I need to be in front of the students but if it continues to deteriorate, I may even consider quitting. The only thing that gives me a tiny bit of hope is seeing that some people could find a way to keep it under control or even heal it. So I guess we must keep trying until we see some improvement. Last thing is as sebderm is stress related and I have plenty in my life right now I am going to see a psychiatrist and maybe start taking antidepressants."
depression,fesg91r,t3_eq7hc5,1579364866.0,So sorry for your loss. I know exactly how it feels. I cried non-stop for a week and still shed tears when I recall that moment.
SebDerm,fes9zre,t1_fervuhe,1579363076.0,You've been suffering longer than I have but did you eliminate the possibilities of candida overgrowth or leaky gut? I believe there must be a root cause and I usually come across stories of people talking about how their sebderm healed after fixing these issues.
SebDerm,ferrgln,t3_eqfjbq,1579357503.0,I am also trying to get rid of the redness that is on my face. Antifungal cream that I use only reduces the redness for a day or two (I was told to use it once a week by my derm). I use aloe vera but like you it does not help me much either. As a last resort I am going to ask for an allergy test when I go to my derm next week. I guess it is good to know if you have any triggers.
SebDerm,fej45tq,t3_ep9tke,1579156217.0,My derm also prescribed me a low potency hypocortisone and did not give me clear instructions as to how long I should be using it despite asking her. After searching I decided to stop 2 weeks later. It did not even help me a bit anyway.
