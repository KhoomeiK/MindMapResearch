personalfinance,ff9hyel,t1_ff9d4pc,1579713406.0,"Timing the market is a fool's errand. If you are planning to invest for the long term, you're almost certainly better off buying now. Yes, the stock market is high, but the chance you predict a drop correctly is small. A lot of people lost a lot of gains waiting for it to drop in 2013. It's also nearly impossible to predict when the bottom is until it's already gone by.

If you aren't planning to hold a stock investment long term, then you shouldn't be considering buying it after the drop either. Bond funds exist, which are less volatile at the cost of lower gains. If you are investing for the shorter term (2-5 years), these are often wiser investments."
