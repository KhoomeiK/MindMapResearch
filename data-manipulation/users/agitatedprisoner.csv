Someone that feeds off the host and tries to take more and more, leaving less and less for everyone else.  Are some who'd cross our borders human parasites?

A nationalist country would only want to take in those immigrants it supposes taking in would serve it's exclusive national interests.  Is this what you propose?

I can imagine this playing out much the same way in an entirely privatized system on account of the doctors not wanting to accept any liability for risks involved in patient transport.  I can imagine it argued that the parents didn't have the right to subject their child to whatever life awaited given whatever alternative treatment, the child having been determined to be in a hopelessly comatose state.  If given the laws on the books the NHS didn't have the right not to release the patient then the law was broken.  Presumably if that was the case then next time hospital counsel will realize the precedent and not make the same mistake, else face substantial fines and be made to pay damages.

Instituting M4A doesn't alleviate the need to answer these sorts of questions.  But it would allow us to answer them to the best of our ability, as a people.  Otherwise if a patient doesn't have the money for non-emergency care that patient is out of luck, regardless of other considerations.

ShitPoliticsSays,ff48v5b,t1_ff3yf63,1579558077.0,"Paying someone less for the same service doesn't reduce the amount of resources expended in it's delivery.  These paper costs aren't the issue here.  At issue here is the difference in the very real costs between different healthcare systems associated with spending time figuring out how to craft plans, what's covered, what it's going to cost, assessing the merits of claims, denying claims, settling disputes in the courts, and everything that goes into getting these things done.  As with most things if there's only one payer, the government, efforts directed towards these ends need not be duplicated by each and every private actor in the market in formulating and executing their policies.  Also because the government already has an independent payment system in place through the existing tax system (way to pay for it) so many additional efforts need not be expended sending out bills, hiring clerks, etc.  Switching to a universal single payer model promises to deliver all these real gains, not just on paper.  

It's not about paying doctors or hospitals less.  It's not in the interest of citizens to want to pay providers too little to attract them to deliver services since this means going without.  It's possible to imagine rates of compensation for services to be set too low but this is an objection to bad rate setting, not to the model of universal single payer.  It's possible to want M4A and disagree as to what the rates should be.  But given the inefficiencies in the existing system rates could even be increased and the percent of GDP spent on healthcare could still decline.  There's no need for a ""40% reimbursement reduction"".

Rich nations tend to spend more but the next closest in healthcare spending to the US hovers at ~12.5%.  The waste tied in to healthcare administration costs accounts for the difference.

Who deserves what and who gets to decide?  The premise behind outrage over this case seems predicated on the notion that the parents should have the right to decide the course of treatment, but this isn't a right afforded regardless of national healthcare system since treatment hinges on doctor's discretion and social agreement as to what's covered, public or private.  Would you be outraged had similar parents purchased a private policy in the USA and been denied coverage by their insurance company?

The long term solution to preventing unwanted immigration is to prevent the conditions which lead people to want to go places they're not wanted.  If one country exerts it's influence to coup the democratically elected government of another, this leads to problems, and people immigrate to flee those problems, if the offending country doesn't like it shouldn't it stop undermining democratically elected governments?  Some rich assholes like doing it because then they get to have their way overseas and get sweet deals for extracting resources and maybe access to cheap foreign labor, these same rich assholes don't mind that as an ancillary benefit immigrants flock to the US illegally that can then be exploited on account of not being able to complain without being deported.

The logic goes, immigrant = person so illegal immigrant = illegal person.  Using the phrase ""undocumented immigrant"" is technically correct and avoids the problem.  It's a small thing but what's the harm?  The way one chooses to use language communicates more than just the words spoken.  You hear another call someone an illegal alien and you can infer that person is right wing, hear another call another an undocumented migrant and the tacit meaning is very different.  Would you fault Democratic politicians for favoring compassionate language?  Is this the hill to die on?  Are there not bigger issues at stake?

For example US citizens pay by far the most per capita for health care and receive care little or no better than many countries offering all citizens universal coverage.  Not only is the US system inefficient, arcane, and inhumane to those unable to afford to use what health insurance they're able to afford, it ties people to their jobs just for the health insurance package.  Isn't it past time to switch to universal single payer Medicare for All so that the nation might spend fewer resources, deliver more health care, and relieve citizens of the need to decide whether to go untreated for potentially serious or painful conditions?

Or concerning illegal immigration, part of the reason so many come here is because conditions are shitty in their countries of origin.  The reason for this often has to do with US policy.  For example the Obama administration supported a coup in Honduras and a humanitarian crisis was the result.  Just this past month the Trump administration supported a coup in Bolivia.  Under Clinton NAFTA created conditions which fostered firms in the US moving production facilities to Mexico while exporting to Mexico cheap agricultural products, which displaced many Mexicans from their trades and caused an upsurge in migration.  Bernie Sanders would reverse direction on this."

For example capitalism speaks to opinions as to what would be the just use of force in the context of defending private property and private ownership of the means of production.  When should the police and courts intervene, and on whose behalf?  Given a difference of opinion on what the law should be and how it should be enforced it's coherent for two people to each self describe as capitalist and not consider the other as such, on account of supposing that other person fails to respect the justice of such and such property arrangement or transaction.  For example if I feel understanding the fine print is on you then even if you can't read I might think you're a dirty socialist to challenge the justice of the transaction, depending on some nanny state to have your back.

yimby,fet9mqk,t1_fet3eb2,1579373024.0,"We don't need to agree, all I need is permission to develop the sorts of projects I and others demand.  You'd see such SRO's all over and homelessness wouldn't be nearly the thing it is today were it not for draconian zoning preventing investors like me funding the supply of what so many people would demand.

If you find the homeless and problems relating to homelessness offensive one would think you'd support my endeavor to build SRO's that would drastically reduce the average cost of housing and with that cost, homelessness.

I'd suggest looking into modern SRO's, they're not especially similar to SRO's of the past.  Code is that every bedroom must have a large window and has been since basically forever.  What has changed, though, is that with modern building materials and methods units can be very well soundproofed, much beyond levels commonly found in apartment complexes.  As a consequence residents could enjoy greater relative peace and quiet.  Also these days HVAC options are superior such that each resident could be afforded private climate control.  The tiny volume of air needing regulation means CO2 levels would be much lower given sufficient HVAC than with alternative plans.  As a consequence modern SRO dwellers would sleep better, research shows.  Given these two innovations the modern SRO doesn't suffer deficiencies in noise and air quality.

Party hosting options are much greater in the modern SRO, since those wanting to so host would have use of plush common rooms which could be reserved.  Given that ample common rooms are included in the build residents would find suitable spaces available on demand.  It's possible spaces might sometimes be occupied, this is a loss relative to enjoying exclusive control of similar spaces.  But is avoiding this possible inconvenience worth paying for that space all the times you're not fully utilizing it?  For most I'd wager not.  For those who are hosting daily parties SRO living wouldn't be for them.

Those with families would rent a room for each family member.  In theory this should still be cheaper relative to other ways of living since the exclusive space per resident would still be minimized.  While this wouldn't be true concerning new construction over time this reality would come to pass.

Concerning those with jobs, mixed use SRO's represent an enormous profit opportunity.  Presently firms must secure often expensive office space which goes unused outside business hours.  In an SRO a firm could locate it's workers in regular dwelling units and schedule regular meetings in common spaces, freeing up the entire office space budget and relieving employees the need to commute."

Working at your desk?  Isn't most building space wasted or underutilized, presently?  Isn't building less exclusive space and more shared discretionary space the answer to this waste?

Personally I can afford to live nearly anywhere, have lived in all different sorts of settings, and to live in a modern top-notch SRO is my ideal.  Reason being, not only would it afford me all I need and want in terms of personal space, it'd relieve me of the need to clean and maintain property while costing the least possible amount for modern conveniences and comfort.  Why do I care if I don't exclusively own a family room if I might avail myself of similar available spaces on site?  I don't get it.  When I hear people bemoan what's given up in SRO's I wonder whether they've given thought to what's gotten in exchange.

Also, SRO's allow for higher density such that surrounding spaces which would otherwise become exclusive and personally inaccessible housing/developments/parking lots might become parks or whatever other useful thing every resident might choose to enjoy.

The more exclusive space that's insisted upon the less space remains for the rest.  A well designed SRO could feel like having a mansion to yourself, whatever space you imagine needing being available for your exclusive use, and then the exclusive use of another when you vacate.  Doesn't it just make sense?

Buses beat cars.  We could all own and drive cars and fill spaces with garages and parking lots and paved roads or we could develop a great bus system.  Cars to buses is a nice analogy for apartments to SRO's.  With buses and SRO's done right there's no contest.  We can all be rich or we can all chase riches while burning the planet."

That said if the argument is that building an expensive high rise featuring expansive luxury units won't lower global rents, that person is right.  Over time adding relatively more expensive housing stock means pushing up average global housing prices.  Realized multifamily developments tend to be relatively more expensive to build per unit and so multifamily gets a bad rap.  However the absolute least expensive modern form of housing when all associated costs of living are considered, the modern midrise SRO, would drastically lower local housing costs if developed in mass.  Usually when local renters talk smack about multifamily projects gentrifying areas they have in mind those of the high rent variety.  New SRO builds would accomplish precisely the opposite."

Consider: I own a single family home.  The market value of my single family home is whatever another is willing to pay for it.  How much others are willing to pay for it depends on their perceived alternative ways of meeting their same need.  So, if other cheaper forms of housing are constructed and go up for rent nearby this drives down the value of my property because people will have a cheaper way to meet their need for housing.  So what do I do, if I'm a jerk trying to protect or inflate the value of my property?  I band together with other local property owners to pass an exclusionary zoning ordinance that prohibits anyone from erecting cheaper dwellings.

If I understand you correctly you're saying that 6 wolves will abuse 4 sheep unless each sheep gets 2 votes in animal senate.  But the result of setting up a 6-4 wolf house and an 8-6 sheep senate isn't some equitable outcome given their irreconcilable differences but total gridlock.  The wolves will always vote to eat some sheep and the sheep will always block any proposal that their own be eaten.  Doing it your way, given the presumption of irreconcilable differences, means the wolves starve.

Wherever affording some unequal representation places the balance of power the strong will use that power to abuse the weak, if the presumption is irreconcilable difference.  All then affording some more say than others in the halls of power does is change who gets abused.  Is this ethical?  It's pragmatic to strive for every personal advantage but hardly laudable to frame the advantage of some as being to the detriment of others; one would think we should strive for something more around which to make common cause, a lofty ideal or way of doing things that's to everyone's advantage.

Seems only art that's expensive to make absolutely must be marketed or self-financed by the very wealthy, like most of what makes it to theaters.  What's stopping anyone with an internet connection from writing whatever or making a camera phone movie and putting it on reddit or Youtube?

The bigger problem to dissemination of ideas than great artists being constrained by the workings of capitalism is that the audience just isn't ready for it.  Most people are outright hostile to demands for universal justice.  Predictably art to that effect tends to not go over.  The artist is left to chip around the edges of bigotry and prejudice.  Such as it's always been, the curse of those who see far is to see around themselves a sea of idiots.

Which isn't to say what's depicted can't be true or real or valuable but that any value it has is going to follow from being viewed by others who (unlike me) do ""get"" it.  I can imagine a great but very niche movie loaded with inside jokes and technical jargon that a handful of people on Earth would think is an absolute master work that the rest would walk out on after 5 minutes."
BreadTube,fdxwxwv,t1_fdvbj7x,1578773786.0,"Art goes to shit under tyranny because good art speaks to the way it is or should be and tyranny isn't something anyone but the tyrant thinks should be.  The tyrant doesn't approve of good art and would confiscate or destroy good art and persecute those who'd create it.  The oppressor's sense of what constitutes good art is twisted to the tyrant's own ethos, that might makes right.  The tyrant would paint him or herself in the form of the mighty and paint the mighty as the inheritors of creation.  Tyranny is ugly and so the tyrant's favored art is ugly, should one manage to see it from both one's own as well as the tyrant's point of view."
