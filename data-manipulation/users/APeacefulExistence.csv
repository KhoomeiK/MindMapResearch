depression,fec23th,t1_febviz6,1578965527.0,Yes you do.
depression,fec22gq,t1_febsiax,1578965509.0,That's really sweet. They must care about you!
depression,fec1ym2,t1_febpytn,1578965458.0,Whoa. This one hit particularly hard.
BreakUps,fe389qn,t1_fc0agou,1578846888.0,"Update, now I don't even have a choice. I pissed her off and she blocked me."
AskAnAmerican,fdd63oj,t1_ex03gfi,1578296431.0,"Just moved here from the midwest. While it's significantly less busy than LA, most places are still packed. After all, it's a city with 1.5+ million people. If you want relaxed, either go central, inland, or anything north of San Fran (specifically Humboldt county) would be your best bet."
AskAnAmerican,fdd5y7w,t1_ewxywie,1578296242.0,"Late reply, but we're pretty similar people, it's weird actually. You're in Louisville, I'm from Cincinnati. Moved here to San Diego, loving it but feel the way you do about it. You lived in Orlando, I used to live in Gainesville. Never been to Hawaii, but would give a testicle to go there. Your description of Florida is how I feel too.

Again, very strange how similar we are in this situation."
BreakUps,fc63xrz,t3_egawue,1577471714.0,Damn. I need to start feeling this way. Good job.
BreakUps,fc1at33,t1_fc1917m,1577313219.0,"She's definitely not a narcissist, but I appreciate the feedback regardless. She was extremely giving when we were together, and it wasn't an act. I know her."
