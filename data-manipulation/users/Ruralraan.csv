GetMotivated,fffj5p6,t3_etbqpu,1579885090.0,"It's a process. You need to evaluate what started it, what made you stay home in the first place. Watching TV, Patrying and everything following resulted from needing to cope, to not deal with the way you felt, I think. 

What made you stop attending classes?

Were you exhausted? You had a lot going on during school, did you push too much, so now the next milestone being a few years distant you just couldn't bring your self to class? 

Was the career path the right one? You seem talented in a few different branches, did you secretly rather had chosen smth different and felt stuck? Didn't want to disappoint your parents for choosing smth they won't like you to do? 

Were you overwhelmed from living not at home anymore? Your life in school sounds pretty structured, it isn't too uncommon that one struggles to 'suddenly' fill their own schedule, balance out chores and self care, get their life organized. Maybe they never learned it, or have never been taught how to do any household tasks. Or have an underlying condition (ADHD, depression, trauma, ...) that was 'under control' in a more structured environment. 

And so on. There might be a whole lot other reasons and most likely more than one or two, nicely interwoven. 

Be aware how it makes you feel thinking about it it, that might as well be a conglomerate of interwoven feelings that made you run towards alcohol. You need to detangle them and find a coping strategy for each one of them. The addictive substance/ behaviour is a 'kill it all' switch for any unpleasant feeling, but different feelings need different treatment. And it needs to be practised in non emergency situations, firefighters need training so to speak. 

Tackle the aforementioned causes in small steps, since they made you run in the first place, so careful to either not push you over the edge, but also not giving in the impulse to start delaying. 

It helped me a lot to practice acceptance that my situation and my life is as it is and starting to take responsibility for myself and my actions, to try to stay committed to leaving the old path. Essential for me was to accept that's a process, that it just went better gradually, or going one step back again, that I still fuck up so often even though I try so hard to do better. I also stopped attending university in my first semester, got addicted, dropped out, struggled, got sober some times, relapsed some times. I now have worked my way back up into grad school, working already in my field outside, have a PhD thingi in prospects, but still struggle a lot from day to day, still falling back into not helpful behaviour or relapse from time to time. It gets better, for sure, but it still feels like failing more often than being able to do anything even 'ok'.

Edit: proofreading is still a thing I need to practise."

I truly believe you are way stronger than you think you are. Ofc it costs more energy to be on your own, but he also is costing you a big chunk of energy. 

You and your son are already alone/lonely in some ways. Your partner isn't really there for you - is he for his son? It sounds as you were carrying all the responsibilities. But he is responsible for being a dad and being in your son's life. He is obligated to make you able to stay to have mum and dad around, to put it this way around. And he didn't. You aren't a failure, you put up with a lot. But it didn't work so far, it's ok to try something new.

He sounds depressed, he needs help. But you are not the one to help him, that's on his own to find (professional) help. You are busy studying, bringing up your children and earning money. You have in no way any resources nor the responsibility to help him. You aren't trained or a professional to help a depressed person, even if you were, it was on the one hand unethical to 'treat' a person you know personally, on the other: you don't have infinite energy to do all that. 

What do you want a relationship to look like? Which steps does he need to take to get there, what are you realistically able to do, accept, work with? And remember you don't have to set yourself on fire to keep him warm or the family together. How long is it acceptable for you to wait? Sit him down, tell him what you want him to do and if he doesn't follow through, be consequent! 

What do you have to lose? You seem to be in an on and off relationship and nothing seems to change with him.

Why is it on and off tho? Are you afraid of being alone? You already sound very lonely tbh. I found it more hurtful to be lonely with a partner than without. Or do you want your children to grow up with a 'healthy' family? Well they don't, if nothing changes. The only thing they'll take away from this is that's ok for one partner to let the other do all the work, make them suffer and never change. That it is normal for partners to be emotionally unavailable, don't take care of their mental health and so on. Or is it that you feel bad to leave a person with mental health problems? That's ok if they don't get professional help."

Same for black and  white  thinking: I think it's really painting us in all black to say we are such great manipulators and string pullers, but if we were, why aren't  we better? Why is it so easy to detect? If we were, weren't we better at hiding it? Because it's not manipulation. Yes often it's a hurtful or unhealthy and puts the other side under a lot pressure, but it stems from an immediate distress. We are in as much distress as we put them in. But yeah, it's easier to make us the bad guy. Don't  separate the person from the action. Yes the action was bad (and I try to find healthier solutions), but I am not a bad person per se.

It took me nearly dying to get the right diagnosis. I had a stuffed nose, itching throat and inner ears and was coughing badly for months and wasn't taken seriously at my GP for months. I was diagnosed earlier with depression and was very thin, so the GP insisted upon a persistant cold. He said because of my depression and being very thin I had to be be anorexic and that causes my persistent cold. He prescribed me some codein and told me to eat a lpt oatmeal gruel to gain weight. 

I wasn't anorexic, and even if I was, it's not cured by:'eat a lot this and this to gain weight'. I was so upset that I luckily didn't take the codein. This went back and forth for 7 months. I didn't believe him it was a cold, he didn't believe it was something else than a cold. 

Then one evening I just couldn't stop coughing very badly for hours. My then boyfriend came home, saw me, stuffed me into the car and took me to the ER. My body was completely red, about to turn blue. The nurses at the hospital put me immediatly into a shock room, they put a mask with inhalation meds onto my mouth/nose, gave me an IV in my right arm as well as in my left and really struggled to calm the coughing and get me to breath for some time. I had to stay overnight. 

Turned out I had developed some allergies and allergic asthma (most likely caused by my mouldy apartment) and the codein my GP prescribed could have killed me if I took it during an asthma attack.
