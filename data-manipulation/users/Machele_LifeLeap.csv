productivity,feeqq0l,t3_eopf9d,1579039194.0,"This is one of those thoughts that seems like a good one because it seems like it would motivate you into taking action. But it’s not. It’s not even really attainable because what do you consider “productive”? 

Why do you need to be productive? What do you make it mean about you when you’re not? What type of people aren’t productive after work? I would really dig into your thoughts to get a real glimpse of what is going on there."

selfimprovement,fdoepxl,t3_em56ot,1578603730.0,"1) You 1000% can be happy again. 

2) Decide to take 100% responsibility for what you need in life. All to often we rely on people in our lives to help heal us and we have too many expectations of them. Nobody can heal us but ourselves. 

3) Give yourself what you need. The best way to do this is to catch yourself when you think I wish my Mom would \_\_\_\_, I wish my friends would \_\_\_\_\_, those are the things that you need to give yourself. If it's I wish my Mom would understand how much pain I'm in and show me some compassion...change that to "" I will respect how much pain I'm in and find a way to express self-compassion"". 

You love yourself and the happiness is there, you just need to start chipping away at what is blocking it."

selfimprovement,fdodxf8,t3_emf28u,1578603351.0,"An emotion is just a vibration in the body, harmless. The thoughts that come with those emotions are the problem...if you believe them to be true, that is."
selfimprovement,fdodsqj,t3_em8bqw,1578603289.0,"Yep - we have a primal brain (the one that wants to do the fun thing, the easy thing, and instant gratification) and we have the logical forward-thinking side of our brain. Every single one of us has thoughts from the primal brain ""Drink the drink, eat the junk, watch TV, play games, etc."" You just need to practice not obeying that side of the brain. It's like a toddler running around with a knife. Of course you want to do the easy thing in the moment, that's totally normal. You just have to learn how to let those thoughts pass and continue to work towards what you really want in life."
selfimprovement,fdodep4,t3_emalv9,1578603101.0,What if the fear is just part of that? What if you focused on learning how to go after goals even when you feel fearful of them? How would you show up differently if you just knew that being afraid of success was part of the human experience and didn't mean anything was wrong with you?
selfimprovement,fdod4nc,t3_em8vt9,1578602971.0,"A good journal exercise for you would be to answer what if to each one...the fear is the problem, not the actual outcome you're fearing. For example, why would it be so bad if you blanked? Or why would it be so bad if you offended someone? Why would an accident be so bad - they happen all the time and people recover. I would spend less time trying to get over the fear and more time worrying about why that feared outcome would be so bad. 

Assume that someone gets offended by something you say (some will, some won't), so what? Like seriously. People can even get offended if you don't talk...we have no control over that. 

I think the above exercises would help you gain some insight and the ""heat"" out of the fear you're feeling."
selfimprovement,fdlc52a,t3_elvmwa,1578520871.0,We can also change our thoughts which drive our emotions and will change everything in our life.

selfimprovement,fdlc1sa,t3_elz1dv,1578520815.0,My motivation for many years was to fix what was wrong with me.

selfimprovement,fdlbvu8,t3_elwrgn,1578520716.0,"I can definitely relate to this! I went through a similar phase in my late 30s. I was hard-core codependent and I didn’t even know what the hell that was at the time. Codependent no more is a book that completely changed my life. 

Also, when I first started getting to know me, I had to literally ask myself each morning who am I today? And some days I was a person who had no idea who the hell I was and that was OK. I just kept asking myself that question each morning and the answers would change and I learned to make peace with the version of me that had no idea how to answer that question."
selfimprovement,fdlbfp0,t3_elyqn0,1578520449.0,"Might be as simple as just having the awareness when you start slipping into that mode and making a conscious decision that you don’t do that anymore.

selfimprovement,fdlbbdz,t3_elxvm7,1578520377.0,"This is legit just what people do. I think in most cases they genuinely come from a place of trying to be helpful. and then some are just projecting their own insecurities on you. I think the only problem is you’re making those things mean something about you. People will always have judgments and that will never change. 

Some people will think you should have better sticks for the hotdogs, and some people will think you shouldn’t even be eating hotdogs. How would you like to respond when someone says you need to _______ in a way that feels better for you. It could be as simple as how weird that they are so worried about hotdog sticks or I knew it was a tight fit with the pool table of course they think I should move it… No biggie."
selfimprovement,fdlapev,t3_elx4f9,1578520016.0,"Why is it so bad that they whine and complain so much? I have friends that are a combination I have some that are super positive and go-getters and I have some who tend to be more negative and whiny. I just show up more curious and compassionately with the whiny ones I don’t take that on as my own. 

What if you stop trying to change them and just let them be messy and find a way to have fun with them (without them changing)? I can tell you from experience that our friends can be a super motivated and positive and they can also be very negative and whiny at times and learning how to hang out with both types without it impacting your emotions is a really good skill to learn."
selfimprovement,fdlah19,t3_elxaq7,1578519879.0,I would get clear on what the motivation is for either and go with the reasons you like best.
selfimprovement,fdladnv,t3_elyqn0,1578519824.0,So are you saying like you want to make sure you sit with good posture and you forget to stay conscious of doing that in school… As an example?

Once I've scheduled all of those tasks on my calendar, I just wake up do what's on my calendar and let myself chill when I have open spots on the schedule. If I hit my goals (and I aim big), I let myself chill out without feeling bad about it. 

You just have to find what works for you. Try out a few different options for a few weeks and see which ones works best for you. :)

There's a big difference in chilling out because you earned and chilling out as a way to avoid life and hide out from problem. Be aware of which one you're doing."
DecidingToBeBetter,fcyod2w,t1_fcyo1ju,1578083827.0,Chilling out is only procrastinating if you’re doing that instead of what you should be doing. I’m totally cool doing whatever I want if I knock out all the stuff on my schedule. I don’t consider that procrastinating at all

I think it’s natural for us to compare ourselves to other people, we get into trouble though when we start believing those judgmental thoughts  about ourselves. 

Start with baby steps by just recognizing when you’re falling into that, remind yourself that you’re just being a human being, and you can choose not to hang out in that space.

For example when you catch yourself comparing yourself to another person, remind yourself that you don’t have to believe those thoughts and that most of them aren’t true anyway.

I am a life coach and we are all incredibly cruel to ourselves with our default thought chatter. The good news is you can clean it up but first you have to become aware of what you’re doing… And realize it’s totally optional."
DecidingToBeBetter,fcyjgm1,t3_ejix4h,1578081084.0,It is all about balance. If you go to extreme one way you will bounce back and go to extreme the other way.

What emotion drives you to get on the Internet? Is it boredom, curiosity, a desire to numb out, etc.? 

I will use boredom for an example. Come up with 3 to 5 other things you can do when you feel bored and actually make a list. 1. Call someone 2. Read a book 3. Take a walk 4.
