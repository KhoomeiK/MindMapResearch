WitchesVsPatriarchy,ff6j5z3,t1_f9f2f9b,1579628328.0,50 shades of grey annoys me an unreasonable amount.
notliketheothergirls,ff6avxa,t1_ff6aij1,1579623169.0,"While I try not to say mean shit, she wasn't very conventionally attractive... I was a VERY stupid teenager."
notliketheothergirls,ff5074z,t1_ff5014g,1579576729.0,"First girlfriend actually. So yeah, at 16 I didn't even know what red flags looked like. Looking back, I'm wondering how I could stand her. Glad you got outta yours as well, kind stranger."
notliketheothergirls,ff4xme4,t3_erjv3a,1579574894.0,I actually dated someone who was racist. She was a piece of shit in every other aspect of her life too. That shitshow lasted a month and a half
notlikeotherguys,feu6xul,t3_dzsvj4,1579383736.0,How the fuck is someone handsome AFTER you get to know them? Surely that would be one of the first things you determine.
MurderedByWords,fecfd5f,t1_fe8o93l,1578972585.0,Thank you.
rpghorrorstories,fe651jg,t3_enlq5q,1578881941.0,Not allowing you to level up your own character is 1 weirdly controlling and 2 I can't imagine playing a character you essentially didn't build would be very fun. That sounds like a terrible game for you
justneckbeardthings,fe2x9ms,t1_fe2s02x,1578843891.0,"However it was very difficult to do so, which is why they used warhammers and maces etc to be able to break through the armour"
Nicegirls,fdyxvlc,t1_fdymnyo,1578784687.0,Hes joking.
fatlogic,fdkxuvp,t1_fdkfjjk,1578513397.0,Also we need to use their bodies as an infinite power source
unwantedsexts,fdiolsj,t3_eljo4q,1578447554.0,"If only he knew what biweekly meant
Edit: word fixes"
EDAnonymous,fdfca87,t3_efq46g,1578358307.0,Confidence is one of the most attractive traits in a person. Being confident and pretty isn't mutually exclusive
pussypassdenied,fddft12,t1_fbylub1,1578310345.0,I'm pretty sure he was one of her autistic students or something. That's the only way she would have power over him
crazygirls,fd7emgc,t3_ejwa5w,1578203270.0,"Wow. There is no more surefire way to SCREAM ""I'm insecure that you don't want me back"""
gatekeeping,fd7cy4y,t3_ek5q7p,1578202540.0,"As someone who prides myself for reading well and a lot, this is way more insulting than it probably should be."
Nicegirls,fd6far1,t1_fd668kk,1578190105.0,You found a troll my guy.
Nicegirls,fczigcm,t3_ejmirk,1578101957.0,Dude. My ex tried to tell me how I felt too. Classic manipulation/gaslighting. Cut the bitch off. Shes toxic as fuck.
LeopardsAteMyFace,fcxcast,t1_fcxc59h,1578058997.0,What worked against the guy I know is literally asking why it would effect the government program. He couldn't give me an answer. Probably because all he does is spout conservative viewpoints without actually thinking about them on his own.
crazygirls,fcx4b89,t3_eiym9s,1578050622.0,This reminds me wayyyy too much of my first girlfriend. Threatened to kill me if I left. That was one toxic ass relationship.
LeopardsAteMyFace,fcx41zo,t1_fcx2vzs,1578050307.0,I have no idea why they say that. I don't understand it whatsoever. What does having the same values have to do with a government program working or not? Its completely baffling to me
justneckbeardthings,fcx3ve8,t1_fcwi1ec,1578050075.0,"As someone who has been raped by a pedophile, no. That is really not helpful to solving the underlying problem. Killing people that haven't hurt children regardless of what their body tells them to do isn't the answer here."
SelfAwarewolves,fctwvtq,t1_fcspja2,1577963659.0,"LET you? What does she think your wife is, your mother? What a petty little woman."
fatlogic,fcp599s,t1_fcnr2vj,1577850887.0,"Ah, I thought of the other buckle as a noun. But you're entirely right. Thank you."
niceguys,fcmfpxr,t3_ehnt7k,1577773561.0,You handled that exquisitely well. You cut right through his bullshit and took away all his ammunition. Perfectly done
fatlogic,fcmfifu,t1_fclc1ub,1577773352.0,"How are run buckle and overlook contranyms? At most the two definitions of buckle are separate, but they dont outright contradict one another. Am I missing something?"
iamverybadass,fcb1pyg,t3_egt2ty,1577581011.0,"The man is quoting john wick unironically. Why. Fucking, WHY."
ihavesex,fbz7edh,t3_ef9ti9,1577237403.0,How small is this mans dick?!
Blursedcomments,fbxm4rn,t1_fbxlrcx,1577193535.0,It is
BadMensAnatomy,fbxlrzp,t1_fbx4hun,1577193153.0,Someone there kinda did
fatlogic,fbwm2ar,t1_fbw3ff7,1577153494.0,I understand but from a purely scientific stance I'd be interested to see what amount of muscle induces health problems
fatlogic,fbvz4iv,t1_fbvvk03,1577138191.0,"You are correct. F=ma. With acceleration in this case being gravity, a higher mass(more fat) does indeed mean more force pulling down. Of course this applies to muscle too, which makes me wonder about the health implications of having too much muscle mass."
Tinder,fbvx59n,t1_fbu7z8h,1577137366.0,Ya know what? You do you man. You do you.
Tinder,fbu7xj2,t1_fbt7u3e,1577109487.0,That depends on the state. If you're talking midwest... you're delusional
