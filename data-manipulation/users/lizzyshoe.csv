Sacramento,ff70byu,t1_ff6zc6n,1579638573.0,I think that was a sarcastic comment. It's quite obvious how you feel from your first comment.
Sacramento,ff00ien,t1_fezyvb4,1579463863.0,"Guess you aren't getting a sandwich, then."
Yosemite,fezx15j,t1_fezwsow,1579462778.0,Alcohol-based sanitizers can kill many types of viruses. Washing with soap and scrubbing is most important.
Sacramento,fezwwsn,t1_fezvbbn,1579462729.0,To weak to make it yourself? Do you need YouTube video instructions? Google can help you with that.
Sacramento,fezs3ur,t1_fezrltu,1579460935.0,It wasn't obviously a joke. That's why you're getting downvoted. Might want to edit.

Men decided the rules for everything, which excluded women, then said it was women's fault for not making it despite the rules. 

Companies with more diverse boards make more money. But companies refuse to higher diverse boards anyway. It's not because they can't find qualified candidates, it's because they decide that maleness and whiteness is a qualification. 

And you do care if I march for my rights, because you keep saying I shouldn't. 

You are really, really ignorant of how biases work and the effects they have on people who don't look like you. Your kind of thinking is why, for so long, men were expected not to take part in raising their own children in any meaningful way, or why men aren't culturally allowed to express any emotions besides anger. Stop policing gender roles. Don't say, ""women aren't qualified"" when you are denying the hundreds of years of men deciding what we should or shouldn't be allowed to do, then saying, ""oh, they're not good at the things we haven't allowed them to do, it must be biological."""
Sacramento,fezkl4s,t1_fezk335,1579458297.0,"Thanks for giving me one more reason to march. 

Why don't you want people to have the same rights you have? It's not a zero-sum game, you know. If I have more rights, that doesn't mean you get rights taken away."

Marches alone? No. As part of a movement? Yes, they matter."
