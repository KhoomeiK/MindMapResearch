These animals support at least 136 other species through their various activities. However, their historical range has shrunk by more than 95%. There used to be hundreds of millions of prairie dogs in North America. European settlers traveling through the West wrote about passing through massive prairie dog colonies, some of which extended for miles. But over time, their range has shrunk to less than 5% of its original extent due to a host of pressures, including habitat encroachment by humans.

Source: https://www.blm.gov/press-release/blm-and-forest-service-grazing-fees-lowered-2019

Cows eat an average of 24-26 lbs. of hay/grass per day, not including the amount they waste by stepping in it, so most people budget 30 lbs. of dry feed/cow/day. Depending on the quality of the hay, meaning grass vs. alfalfa, the very rough average cost of feeding a cow is $500 USD per year, or $1.37 per day. 

**So... it costs the same amount to feed a cow for a month on public land as it does for one day on a farm or ranch.**"

Sheldrick Wildlife Trust evaluates all their animals before release to make sure they can survive on their own. When they do release them it's more of a ""soft release"" where they put them in an area where they have access to the wild and others of their species, but they also have access to land managed by the rescue. The animal will typically slowly spend more and more time away from the rescue and eventually stay in the wild and not return.

Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has been doing wildlife rescue for over 40 years. They periodically have adult female elephants that were rescued as calves decades ago that return to the rescue to ""show off"" their new calves and say hello to the caretakers that raised them.

AnimalsBeingMoms,fcxbx4a,t3_ejf9ed,1578058672.0,">For a domestic chick, the mother hen is an important role model; chicks learn a great deal from their mother about what to peck, when to rest and how to behave when there is a threat.

>Maternal care in chickens is facilitated by filial imprinting, a process where newly hatched chicks learn to distinguish the shape and sound of their mother, and follow them. This imprinting must occur within a sensitive period in the day or two after hatching.

>The proximity that chicks maintain with the mother allows the expression of maternal care and the development of their social bond. This period of maternal contact which is facilitated by imprinting has important benefits for the correct development of sexual preferences, feeding behaviour, and behavioural synchrony.

Dairy cows are forcefully impregnated every year so that they will continuously produce milk. After their calves are born the calves are typically taken away from them within hours to days so that their milk can be collected for human consumption. The calves are often moved to crude tiny cages, [veal crates or hutches](https://i.redd.it/l82lt2x98sa21.jpg).

From Rancho Relaxo:

> Spike and Elmer have been best friends since the very moment they met. Bonds like theirs are unbreakable! They eat together. They take daily walks together. They sleep next to each other every night. Watching Spike protect Elmer will always be one of the most comical, yet adorable things to me. I love their friendship and us humans can learn a lot from it. We just need to open our eyes and make the connection that is so very clear when in the presence of these two: Animals are sentient beings who love, fear, mourn, celebrate, form bonds, get excited, protect loved ones and more. Animals are just like us - only more forgiving and innocent.

Spike is the duck and Elmer is the pot-bellied piggy."
wildhorses,fc5bsko,t1_fc45sy1,1577452523.0,"I had some friends drive up and we fixed it there, just before dark. I was thankfully very familiar with my vehicle and knew what the issue was.

Yeah, the mud there can be intense since it has a lot of bentonite (clay) in it and when it gets wet, it's super slick. Sounds like you were lucky!

Just 20 years ago there used to be so many horses in the McCulloughs that I would see them any time I drove by the HMAs just on the highways that border them in the Big Horn Basin. You used to be able to see them in the Pryors from the paved road that runs between the Big Horn Canyon and the West Pryor mtn. It's sad how few there are now.

If you're ever planning a trip back, feel free to PM me if you're interested in some local tips on how to get an easier or better look at the horses in either of those HMAs."

My 4WD vehicle broke down in the northern Pryors one day and I had quite a hike to get cell service on a southern south facing ridge line. This was in 2000/01, and I had thankfully JUST bought my first cell phone. I still can't believe I found service."
