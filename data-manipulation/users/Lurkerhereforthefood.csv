I think it's understandable to feel shameful but imo it was what you had to do at the time. Maybe you can look at it from a different point of view, look how far you have come. Good for you."

It's natural to think both things and people will swing either way. You made the decision you thought was right. 

You just lost family. A part of you. I'm so sorry."
offmychest,ff1zhaa,t3_er71dd,1579489805.0,I'm so sorry. <3

offmychest,feksin4,t3_eposhm,1579206694.0,"Hey man hang in there. Maybe you could prompt her about it so you both are on the same page? At least then you know and if you need to, move on. Keep your chin up dude, you'll find someone!"
offmychest,feiuxqz,t3_ep5gjf,1579147894.0,"I only have 3 cats but I think about this kind of thing all the time. My wife often will tell me not to worry but I do. It keeps me up at night. We don't have children so they are my children. I try to think of it as worth it. It will hurt when they die. I will never forget them and feel like the hurt will never go away, but the love and happiness they gave me will also never go away. To me, it's worth it. What's that quote? ""To love and lose is better than to never love at all"" something like that."
offmychest,fec69j3,t3_eo7m5b,1578967336.0,"Maybe something you can do is pay it forward? Like when you see another friend (or the same friend) in need, help them like they helped you and ask for nothing in return. :)"
