I have a whole collection of books that I've read the first two chapters of, or even just the first few pages.

Sometimes I get so distracted that I don't even realise I've put down the book until 10 minutes later, and am now watching T. V.

I wouldn't call these ""snacks"", because snacks usually refers to food that isn't very nutritious, but basically scaled down versions of breakfast, lunch and dinner.

However, school timetables don't accommodate for this, because you only get one break in the middle of the day to eat, and you can't eat during class. So that's the only reason I don't think you could continue this properly, unfortunately."
