Just off the top of my head when Norwich beat Man City. That will have ruined a lot of accumulators.  I recall a Dortmund game recently that was something like 4-4 and they scraped even a draw.

I only mean with teams you'd expect to win away, not all. I don't think it's worth the risk.

It's just my personal opinion, but it's born of plenty of years of betting and first hand experience. I get let down by home teams a fraction of the amount I would with away teams."

Also, you're suggesting that a female dominated field will inherently have what I suppose is womansplaining, which seems a pretty sexist thing to do.

I do work in a female heavy industry and maybe it's just mine but I don't see it. Maybe it's dependant on the industry and the people it attracts, regardless of their gender, than just their gender. But, you have your own opinion and I have mine.

And finally the gendering is born of the experience and evidence. Given your evidence you can just as easily populate another term. However mansplaining comes from a specific male to female act that expects the female to female or female to male act wouldn't be the same."
