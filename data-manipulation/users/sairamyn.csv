Without the essential critical thinking skills philosophy tries to transmit, you would not have a scientific method or science (any science, not just biological) as we know it today.

Think of your philosophy courses as similar to history courses in that sense, and learn to break down arguments you don’t agree with and come up with well-rounded rebuttals to them. It’s a necessary skill!"
