confession,fey9mzp,t3_equbgr,1579442600.0,"Dude that's super awesome, congrats!  Alcoholics who have gone completely sober (the AA crowd) definitely deserve a ton of respect, but the way I see it is, abstaining completely from alcohol, it's almost as if the alcohol still holds dominion over a small portion of yourself mentally. I cant help but believe the ""You are powerless over your addiction"" is the biggest crock of shit ever. Now on the other side of the coin, for an alcoholic to be able to face and deal with their inner demons, teach themselves the control to only have a drink or so every great once in awhile (not because you have to, but just because you feel like it), and are able to stop themselves from going overboard. I would go so far as to say that THAT kind of progress and self discipline for an addict is an even more impressive level of personal growth and will power to achieve than abstaining from it altogether.  As a former opiate addict and alcoholic, I cant explain how great it feels to be able to enjoy a couple glasses of wine every so often just because I  WANT TO, and not because I  mentally and physically need it to get through the day/ cope with my own personal issues/ trauma. Keep up the good work man! You can steadily aim to replace that liquid crutch with things that REALLY matter to you, and then one day alcohol will just be a trivial substance that'll help you relax and unwind with loved ones."
