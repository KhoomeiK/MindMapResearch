Saying ""stop"" is always an option, but doing a shoulder roll and showing disinterest or whatever else to indicate ""fuck off"" indirectly in that situation is likely more tactful. So I'm looking for other ways to be subtle with it unless it's absolutely necessary not to be."
leangains,ffnist9,t3_etrckp,1580066461.0,I'm curious why you're prioritizing getting big when you likely have more pressing needs.
INTP,ffislav,t1_ffhzqyg,1579981669.0,"That could be an inner detector for insincere compliments. If you don't feel inner joy, something is off. It's true, I get that way only with really close people, for compliments on something that I improved on over time, or appreciation for an action."
INTP,ffirc8k,t1_ffif91k,1579980775.0,"That's probably the only exception for me too. Like a REALLY close person complimenting something I genuinely care about and am working to be good on. Damn, maybe that's how everyone feels every time they're complimented. Something to think about"
socialskills,ffeg7tz,t1_ffd5yit,1579846790.0,"You basically have it down. There is advice that applies universally though. For example, boundaries and assertiveness serve as an armour from manipulation, and allow you to meet your needs. The path to solidify that is through real life experience. Everyone has room to ""level up"". As you get older, you tend to get complacent and do what works enough for you to be able to shoulder the rest. Its why a lot of ""naturals"" with great chidhood social experiences dont evolve much beyond the basic traditional path. It worked for them, and theyre not aware of whats possible beyond that.

Anyways, I dont want to recommend anything extreme because I dont want to be responsible for putting you on that path. Ill give you a general idea of whats been working for me, but its a slow and painful process. As a simple one, aim to reach your body's full potential. It will center you, make you feel really good, and make you look way better. Id say aim for 10-12% BF with the highest natural weight possible for your body. This is a lifelong process but its indicating to yourself that you can achieve SOMETHING, that youre aiming for the best for YOU (not caring what people think about it, but how good it makes you feel), and that to get somewhere, you need to stick to it. Its not vain. Its a promise to yourself not to give up on yourself. As an added bonus, you feel and look great. Life looks better. Dont obssess 24/7 over your look though, but its fine to appreciate the progress. 3 full body workouts a week 1-2h), with moderate calorie supervision will get you there over time.

As you do this, go to the gym when its busy, usually in the evening. You will be forced to interact with EVERYONE. Men, women, hot people, angry people etc. Youll be sharing machines at times or having to hold your ground. Imagine doing this 3 times a week. Its creating positive social conditioning, youre getting to interact with all kinds of people and honing your skills, and theres the added benefits of working out that I mentioned. Also, the more you can do your workout without caring, the less that others' perceptions of you will matter. This will help later with girls.

These are the basics though. But this is a bare minimum to not completely isolate yourself from people. Theres the ""wear fitting clothes and groom"" which makes you presentable and feel good, but i shouldnt even mention these. This is the bare minimum for giving yourself the best chances at playing the game of life. And you dont realize that until you do it consistently and see the change over time.

Now that youre doing something ar least, you need a purpose. This will be the source of your wtf moments. Are you really satisfied with your job? No? Give yourself a few months at most to set-up an exit strategy and quit to give a shot for what youre interested in. You might lose money and time, but that experience will be priceless. Or if you cant get girls, go through the cringe of getting a PUA mentor (who may be younger than you) to show you the ropes. It could be something you end up thinking isnt for you, but you dont know unless you try. Even then, you at least you have the real life perspective of doing PUA. And if you do succeed, you could settle into only using those skills when you want a relationship or sex.

 I cant give you step by step examples so ill just explain it so you know how to find and chase them. An experience that forces you to claw your way out, question your values, and/or distorts your perspectivs is a wtf experience. Theres different degrees of this, but youre basically taking the risk and saying fuck it lets see where this takes me. Its up to you though. But BE CAUTIOUS. You cant half-dive into that life and escape. Youll hate yourself more and wont get far. If you decide to do it, either commit or don't."

In my specific scenario, because I lived a sheltered life, there was a lot of aspects emotionally that they would help me figure out that I was unaware of. Kind of like an empath. I've become much more empathetic, self-aware, and grounded because of it. At the same time, I don't know what value I can provide back at this point without having to cave to a leader-follower dynamic, if that makes sense. Like I've already put my ego aside in the friendship because of my appreciation for all they've done, but I'm trying to avoid being a yes-man or adopting their dreams at the expense of my own in the friendship.

Empaths,ff66u7e,t1_ff5vug8,1579620527.0,I appreciate the POV but you lost me at communicating with the dead.
Empaths,ff50g5a,t1_ff4yy0g,1579576913.0,"There could be tons of reasons. It could have not been your fault. They could have just been looking for an excuse to distance themselves. It's not typically mentioned, but even though empaths are givers, in a sense, quite a few tend to seek control from it, in a way. They gain control from having that leverage over someone. When they offer more value than you in a friendship, it can cause an imbalance. This leads to situations where they try to get you to yes-man them (not in a malevolent way, but we all need validation sometimes) and it's hard to say no because you've already become emotionally reliant on their help and already see hope of dealing with the issues you were previously unaware of which still affect your life. And since you rely on them so much, you have more to lose. So it's like you need that balance of putting aside your ego, while still being able to hold your foot down. 

In my case, my empath friend went through trauma, so it's like they're an empath and they like reaching out to people and sharing their experiences, but they also push people away because they feel like they're not getting equivalent value. But they were the one who reached out to you in the first place. It's a weird emotional type thing. Life is weird man. Like I had to put my ego aside to get this arrangement because they're a valuable friend to me."
socialskills,ff4xun1,t1_ff4pdst,1579575055.0,"Even I'm still working on it. I can only get them by doing really risky shit, which isn't ideal, but it works. Basically getting into situations where my reality and worldview is toppled. Even then, you have to know how far you're willing to go to get that perspective. It's fucked. And what's even worse is you'll see some people you admire going like ""just live your life and you'll grow just fine"", but it's total bullshit because they're coming at it from the angle of their own fortunate life experience, without considering the fact that they were raised in an environment with an overload of wtf experiences, and the ability to develop their emotions to a really high degree. If life was a game, and there were tutorials, they were lucky enough to get the tutorial with the high level NPC, and so they reached level 30, already going into adulthood. In comparison, you went to the normal tutorial, and are going into adulthood as a level 5. Anyways, because of their access to those experiences in childhood, by adulthood, it's their base way of existing. They could still grow by going the risky route, there's way more leveling up that's possible, but they can already live comfortably with their experiences from childhood, and just experiencing normal life, so for most, they have no reason to question it because it's not causing noticeable problems.

 Let me give you an example of a wtf experience. Imagine being born in a religious family and believing in that religion. Your parents always talk badly about ""sinners"". Anything to do with sex outside of marriage is viewed as a huge taboo, and despite having experimented a bit with dating, you still have misgivings because of fear. One day you go out with some friends and get shitfaced drunk. You lose all inhibitions. You guys somehow stumble upon a brothel in the area, and you end up sleeping with a prostitute (even as someone shy, if you're drunk enough, you will give no fucks or have any sense of reasoning). You remember what happened and you also remember how cool the chick was with the situation. You don't feel bad about the experience but you feel like you should feel bad. This is the beginning of your wtf experience. Your reality starts to be questioned. You get confused. Your emotions are all over the place. You've heard your parents talk before about people who have sex outside of marriage, but you went even farther. You slept with a prostitute ffs. Even outside the religion, people have their own prejudgements about people who sleep with prostitutes. So then you're like wtf. Clearly, I'm not a bad person. And clearly, it's not as crazy as everyone makes it seem. You've literally went through the experience. So then you start questioning everything you've learned in your life. Religion starts sounding ignorant. Unempathetic, even. You start to realise, ""how the fuck are these people talking about something so confidently without having gone through it?"". You come to the fucked up realisation that most people are talking out of their ass. No one will ever match someone who actually went through something. This applies to everything. Some things cross over. Like if you went through a car crash, it matches the perspective of someone in a different type of accident. They're close enough in terms of experience. But yeah, pretty much, the more you experience shit you have stigma about, the more fucked up you realised things are. You also learn to trust yourself more and more because of those reference experiences. You gain power from having that perspective. For example, Tyler the Creator. He infiltrated the hip hop community then came out subtly as bisexual or gay, either or. You know how much he impacted that community? You know how much power he gained from that? There's an interview where he uses that leverage to make the interviewer uncomfortable because the interviewer didn't know how to react. He purposefully would hit on the interviewer who was one of those ""no homo bro"" hood types, and trolled the shit out of him. The dude was a over 40, with years of ""just living"" life experience on him, but it didn't matter. He was made to look like a child."

I do 4 sets of leg press (with variations), 3 sets of bulgarian lunges, 3 sets of hip thrusts, and then core exercises with weights.

 If you want a brutally honest list of reasons why people could have a good impression of you, here are you are:

(1) You're hot.
(2) You're extroverted and are socially witty, making people seek your validation.
(3) You have some status that the people around you value (a talent, position, reputation).
(4) You've developed a reputation of being a trustworthy, respectable character.
(5) They like your sister and want to indirectly compliment her by complimenting you as someone who's close to her.
(6) A combination of the above.

Here's the answer you might be looking for though. The fact is, if you're driving past the speed limit, or standing out too much socially, you get unwanted attention or punishment from your corporate slave owners or just social backlash which can tarnish your reputation. But in all fairness, there's a good reason for conformity. Car crashes are better prevented with regulation. With regards to ""following a pace"", if you want to play the social game, you need to know how to be yourself without actively garnering unwanted attention.

Anyways, once you reach a point that your purpose in life occupies the vast majority of your mental energy, you won't have time to overthink small stuff like that.

If you have a purpose, then aiming for grooming, being fit, looking better, being confident, and having hobbies should be a given, at all times. Girls or no girls. By the way, you dont need to dominate a room to get a girl or be a comedian. Anyways, increasing your value also increases your chances of achieving your purpose. What could a purpose be? Helping others like yourself. Leaving your mark. Creating something. It needs to be broad enough to realistically challenge you for a lifetime, but specific enough to give you direction. Do you have a purpose?

Guys who are at home who arent busy with hobbies or goals get lost in their mind then dive into the irrational mental abyss of reality, then go crazy, get insecure, self-conscious, depressed etc. Then comes the entitlement to gfs and sex.

Theres lazy guys with no purpose and a girlfriend but their value comes from gifted natural wit, natural talents, or good looks and ngaf attitude. The exceptions are people with gfs who settled and treat them like shit because theyre low value and insecure and conveniently are there.

A girl is a click away from a hot guy ready to fuck. And a flirt away from a decent looking guy with at least some sense of purpose. Why would a girl want to date you? The world owes you nothing.

Youre not spending 5 years to become dateable. Youre spending 5 years to get your shit together. And honestly 2-3 years is doable, for a full transformation in paradigm and just about everything else.

If you are doing this whole self help thing to get girls then save yourself some time. Approach 200 girls and at least 1 will want to fuck and date you. Night club for sex, day approaching for dates. Shell likely be ugly and have issues, but what value do you have to offer any other girl?

If others can't meet your needs meet them yourself. If you feel like you give others too much, develop boundaries. Only give from excess. Dont expect when you give. No one owes you anything. If you did everything and no one accepts you (which I doubt but let's assume that), then fuck it. Stop giving a fuck and just exist. Be a lone wolf. Be independent and own it. See what happens then.

I suggest you check out ""No More Mr Nice Guy"" by Robert Glover. I have a feeling if you read it and genuinely want to change, you will undergo a huge transformation.

socialskills,fctnerh,t1_fctmey6,1577950098.0,"No worries man. The first step is recognizing the issue. After that it's just a matter of time, but you need to let go. You're not one dimensional and obviously youre not always going to be on your A game when it comes to your value. As long as youre able to consistently do it and turn it into a habit, youll reach a baseline value where even when you feel like shit on a certain day you can still have the mental energy to sustain what gives you value to an extent. 

The rest of what youve shared at the root of it seems to be a matter of not thinking youre enough. Its good that you recognize the specific issues but dont hold onto them or beat yourself up for them. Ironically, itll have the opposite effect when you over analyze. You get insecure and self conscious and it lowers your self esteem more. Instead, from my experience at least, I've found it best to take the steps to own who I am even if it comes off as a bit shameless. Over time, it becomes natural and way less awkward. If they compliment you, just say thank you and look back at them. The ball is in their court. You dont need to overthink how they see it. 

Trusting yourself is really important. Guided meditation could be helpful. Look into alan watts. There was an interesting video where he explained how trusting your decisions is similar to trusting your own nervous system. When you sleep you trust your heart to beat, and lungs to move so you can breathe. You trust your entire nervous system. It's the same with yourself. Make the decision thats best for you, then trust your future self to pick up the pieces. The worst that can happen is death. That's why you see so many religions and idealogies promoting the acceptance of death. When the worst case scenario doesnt phase you, you just exist without too much attachment to outcome. I know I'm getting philosophical but there's a lot to this."
socialskills,fctl67p,t1_fctfwtg,1577947339.0,"It's definitely a struggle when you're stuck in that loop of not knowing what you offer and what you need. The best advice I got from my journey was to do things alone. To go outside alone and try things out that I want to do alone. Once I did that, I was able to pinpoint which places I actually had fun and which places I went to just to fit in. From there, the more you do it and experience the more you realize what the needs behind them are and how they're best met.

With regards to value: are you an active listener? That's value. Do you have fun? This means you bring positive energy from your presence. It's that simple. It could even be looks. You're nice to look at. Everyone will equate your value differently. An insecure ugly girl might want a hot guy to feel secure about her attractiveness so your looks have more value for her. A hotter secure girl might be willing to settle for less better looking. A person might like talking a lot and your listening skills makes them value you a lot. You might not talk much so you might enjoy that they carry the conversation. Thats their value. And it can also be more than one thing. Also, your value can attract bad people too. If you buy shit for people, thats your value, or at least one of them. You could attract entitled people who want to use you to buy things. I think you get the point. Its better to have value coming from your personality though rather than from $$$.

If you want to max your social value think of traits you value and appreciate in a friend, and hold true to them if they dont conflict with your personality, for example: holding your word and being trustworthy, being a good listener, being positive, being authentic, being an initiator, not being needy, not putting your own expectations on others, respecting yourself etc. And yes, respecting yourself and having boundaries is value as well. It makes the other person feel like theyre hanging around with a ""high status"" person. It makes them less boring to be around.

This also a bit of a taboo but maximize your looks. It's fucked how much of a difference it makes. The halo effect is real. An ugly person can be really charming and witty to the point of social dominance, but their wit is a genetic and childhood gift and pretty damn rare. It's not something you can just mimick. So people who tell you ""but this ugly friend of mine"" are missing the point. Anyways, looks are like a multiplier to your value. You can be hot and have no friends, but your personality would need to be REALLY unbearable. If you look better AND have great value coming from other places, its literally WAY easier to reach your goals. So I encourage you to exercise and groom. Fashion can be cheap but needs to fit. If youre ripped, most clothes will look good on you. I don't discourage cosmetic surgery as long as its for you to enjoy how you look more for yourself and not because you have a disorder and think you dont look good enough. There's a BIG difference. At least to me, a rhinoplasty is about the same thing as getting braces. It takes confidence to get something and not care what others you know will think about the change. In fact, ironically, if someone doesn't get cosmetic surgery because theyre afraid what people they know will think after they get it, theyre making that decision from a place of insecurity. Just something to think about."

(1) If they're a close friend: look at them inquisitively, and say ""why do you do that?"". Help them recognize their blaring insecurity.

(2) If they're a casual friend: the example someone gave here is great. ""Come onnn, youre too hard on yourself!"", then move the convo along.

It could be a result of childhood but thats not reversible beyond salvaging the pieces and fixing out the edges. A child doesnt have the mental faculties to change things, so the origins of the weakness are irrelevant. If your voice is trash and youre tone deaf, unless you have a hidden talent to help you overcome that, youre spending 10x the effort for a mediocre result at best. Life is too short.

Its always been a single player game. You have to accept that everyone's born with a different difficulty level. If anything, living on hard mode makes improving more rewarding.

Your value isnt what you have compared to other people. Its what you have, period. You are handsome? That's a value. Your an extrovert? Thats a value.

Once you know yourself, your needs, and your value, work to maximize it. Up your looks, and get good at something. Dont do it for a girl though. It should be for you. Wouldnt it be dope to inhabit a body with six pack abs or straight teeth? MAKE SURE its for YOU to enjoy it more. If you do it with the frame of mind of ""im not enough for others, so i need to do this"", youll be shooting yourself in the foot. 

With regards to your needs, know what your aim is. Sex? Fitting in? Getting it done with to deal with the insecurity of being inexperienced? Companionship? This is important. When you REALLY know, youll be surprised how much easier it is to get what youre looking for.

After doing ALL this, what's left? You need to know that 99% of girls are not going to approach you, maybe even 100%. You need to approach women AND be around them. Join things youd like doing alone, and then find those places where girls will also happen to be doing them. Most guys go self-pity mode because they assume girls should approach THEM. How entitled is that? Life isn't fair like that. You need to be around women AND be the one to approach. For example, basketball. Like it? Play co-ed ball. Theres opportunities to meet girls.

When youre with them, act like how you would at home, but with the added banter youd have with your guy friends. Banter with girls is considered as teasing. Flirting is teasing. So just exist and tease. Make it more and more sexual (ex. ""youre good at holding BIG things""). Once theyre receptive to your sexual teasing, then tap shoulders, backs, and go from there to kissing and dating. Don't do it in a needy way, do it in an improv ""im messing around sexually way"". Make sure youre not seeking approval. Also, if after a few tries theyre purposefully ignoring your attempts to establish a flirty frame of interaction, get the message. Some girls also are just flirty which makes things retarded. You need to accept that youll face tons of rejection and be okay with it. Youre the prize, if they dont see that its their loss. No need to prove yourself or build resentment. Be your best self, escalate with teasing and more contact and gage receptivity abd if theyre not receptive, move on. Dont stay friends with a girl if you just want to date her by the way. It kills your self esteem and wastes her and your time. You have to be honest with your intentions. Value your time and your worth. Dont be a tag along. If you accept being friends with a girl even if you just want to date her, youre ruining your own self-image for yourself, treating yourself as not enough, and even if you ""get lucky"", you will be treated as the secondary option you are.
