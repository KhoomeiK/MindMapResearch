I paid about $650 a month rent. I often ate one real meal a day and it was usually plain pasta or beans. I got my lunch from the dollar store and it was usually like a single corn dog or something. I took an hour+ bus commute and then walked a mile. I looked like a skeleton from lack of sunlight, nutrition, and happiness living there.

Everyone always says I'm a great and patient teacher in the workplace and as my classmates or friends, so I went ahead and started getting my teaching certificate. Turns out I am TERRIFIED of teaching and I have so much anxiety about my upcoming classes I want to throw up. But I still haven't gotten any negative feedback and my professors are super eager and encouraging for me to get into the field. I don't understand how because I have a serious problem with brain-to-mouth function and I simply CANNOT figure out how to explain what I'm thinking in a way that makes sense and I'm constantly stumbling over words and forgetting vocabulary. I usually reflect on the last thing I've said and realize the person I'm talking to is missing 95% of the information they needed to understand what I meant and I only said the beginning and end of my explanation. So I don't know where this compliment keeps coming from but at least I've figured out what I DON'T want to do for the rest of my life."
AskReddit,ffbcndz,t3_eskc2n,1579759780.0,Just don't treat her differently because she's a girl. I'm a human with feelings and thoughts and interests like anyone else. Not a separate species. I don't need to be coddled or courted or sexualized or condescended to or protected or put on a pedestal. I don't want to feel like you are treating me like less of a person or more of an ideal because of my gender and I don't want to feel like our potential sexual relationship is getting in the way of a human connection. Treat me like you'd want to be treated by another guy. Anything more blossoms naturally from the respect that comes with that.

I actually had to cover my eyes a couple times. It was so well done. The ending was a little weird but still good, more weird in a del Toro kind of way I think.

You have to be a theater buff and have watched the play a thousand times. If you go into it never having seen the play and expecting a plot and expecting there NOT to be weirdly sexualized cats (also in the stage version) then you will be horrified and uncomfortable. I'll probably be down voted to oblivion for this though. But I'm just wondering if people who love Cats the Broadway show feel the same way as everyone else."

bi_irl,fdneuco,t1_fdmubg8,1578584301.0,"I'm not sure if this is relevant but my experience as a bi person is that I like extremely masculine men and extremely feminine women in different ways and for different reasons. My sexual preferences are pretty binary in that way and gender plays a big role in the way I feel about someone. A pan person would probably find themselves attracted to someone regardless of their gender expression, anywhere on the spectrum, and I bet they'd be more likely to see them pretty equally in regards to their sexual attraction regardless of where they are on that spectrum. In a way they might not ""see"" gender in a potential mate. I am not pan though so I can't really speak to this experience, that's just kind of what I would guess if drawing a distinction from my own experience.

What it all comes down to though is that it's whatever term you're more comfortable with using. There's a lot of overlap between the two, I just think bisexual fits me better because my sexuality is kind of like a ""split personality"" in that one side of me is into manliness and the other is into femininity. Not everyone will feel the same way about their labels and some people might see bi and pan as being pretty much the same depending on how they view gender."
