And I'm just like, what could i possibly say that you dont already know or have considered? We all have access to the exact same resources and often stuff you know cones from just having been there so long and run into it. Some times I get, yeah thats what I thought, and others, ok I'll try that. Its made me so uncomfortable tbh."

The first few nights he ran on the wheel and I guess pissed my first one off because when it got to be bed time he started sleeping in the wheel. Took about a week of that and then they were both days.

Because I found out the person I hate most in the world and would pay to push in front of a bus for no legal consequences just got diagnosed with emphysema. He was already sickly, so hopefully this will push him over the edge. BUT not before i throw whatever you get for completing a triathlon at his face. Fuck you Craig."

AnimalTextGifs,fdhfbmw,t1_fdh92c0,1578421444.0,Thee are very few legitimate breeders. There are tons of rescues that take dogs in and help them go from seemingly aggressive to upstanding good bois. Unless its for some type of work there is less than 1% reason to get from a breeder.
AnimalTextGifs,fdh0f0d,t1_fdgxoio,1578412648.0,"Yes. The smell they cant help. But imagine if you scenario a: had a loving home and one day get to go for a car ride. The door opens and you hop out eager to play. When you turn to look for your best friend, theyve gotten back in the car and are driving away. You try to run after them but the car is just to fast. For the next days, weeks, months , years you spend your days trying to survive one basic instinct skills that you were never taught in a world that looks down on dirty skinny dogs. If youre to sweet, you get beat up by other dogs put in your same situation. So you be come tough and as scary as you can just to survive the humans that try to shoot you when you find food and to fight the other dogs in your same situation. Scenario b; youre born to the above pup that was dump having not been spayed. She does her best to keep you and your siblings fed but its never enough. As a baby you lose two siblings to the elements. As a teen your best friend gets hit by a car and stays squished on the side of the road for you to see the birds pick at their remains for a week or two. As an adult you nearly freeze to death in the winter. And scenario c: you have a loving home. Youre a good boi. Then one day your mom comes home all excited. She slowly starts to get round. After a few months your dad takes you on a car ride to a building that smells of piss and shit and fear. He hands your leash to a volunteer inside. Tells them your name and that your family is expecting a baby and you just don't fit in anymore. Pats your head one more time and walks away. You get lead further into the stench to be put in a cage next to hundreds of others just like you and dog a and dog b. Everyday theres more dogs until there is the stench of death for a few hours until the next day when more dogs come in and the cycle repeats. 



They arent mean; they're scared. If they are actually mean, theyve had to become that way to survive. Theyve been made to be that way. By people. Often times by people that told them they were loved."

interestingasfuck,fcuw25b,t1_fctn6ct,1577989699.0,Um. Hes not over weight. Its the angle of the picture. And he has a little head in relation to his body.

interestingasfuck,fctbaft,t1_fct29nz,1577937950.0,"The pack dynamic can be weird though. My oldest is stupid protective of me. When I lived with my boy friend, if I was asleep and bf left and rentered or wasnt there and then tried to come into our shared room, freeway would jump up and start barking telling him to watch himself. I currently have a friends family staying at my house. Their twin girls and I have the bedrooms upstairs and they sleep in the basement. Anyone that tries to come into whatever room im in, especially if I'm sleeping gets a barking at. Even the 4 year olds. [But as soon as I leave for work he moves into the girls door way and then does the same thing for them.]( https://imgur.com/gallery/8eBtbXN) Hes always been really protective like that, my sister calls him 'protectasaurus.' I'm the primary amd then the girls are secondary the situation we're in these days."
