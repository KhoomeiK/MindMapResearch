facepalm,fdkntik,t3_elu06i,1578507437.0,"Anyone else think it's weird how many anti-progressive memes make it to the front page? There's a pattern of memes that often show people taking a leftist/feminist/progressive point and acting stupid about it/taking it to an illogical point/misrepresenting it, as if to show that all people who support these ideals are just crazy and out of touch when in reality the people being depicted are in the minority. Most people who want gender neutral bathrooms wouldn't complain about this kind of thing kinda like how most trans people won't bite your head off if you accidentally misgender them once, though you wouldn't know it from these memes."
