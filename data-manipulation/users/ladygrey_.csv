CanadaPublicServants,ff0kbog,t1_fez87p8,1579469675.0,"It's just a pretty common thing in French. F.eg. Teacher's College in Ontario has a French test after admission, which nearly 50% of applicants fail on the first try despite having done their K-12 and first Bachelor's in French.

It's not that the government French test is harder, it's that French is objectively harder for both first and second language speakers. There's a certain global standard for French (see the DELF) and the GoC would have to actively break away from that to make their French test easier (it would be the wrong move imo — I'd much rather have all bilingual positions require testing in both OLs)."
CanadaPublicServants,ff0j9bq,t1_fezrc2u,1579469409.0,"It's just a formal French thing. Francophone kids go through the same thing in their French schooling, with the readings and writing being very different from casual spoken French."
CanadaPublicServants,ff0hnf7,t1_feztc41,1579468932.0,"I'd say yes, the English tests are easy if you're fluent. I passed all of mine with Es despite never doing a practice test, though I'd been fluent for around 8 years by the time I did the tests. I passed the reading with full marks and the writing with 1 error (or the other way around — I don't remember). The writing/reading is the type of English I'd use in formal e-mails, and I spoke the same way I would in an interview in my oral test (not super formally, but not as casually as I would with a colleague).

I'm sure this is subjective though"

The majority of students forget this lesson surprisingly quickly though (I taught high schoolers)."

Reference librarians often gently try to get patrons to realize they're fucking up and need to give more context cues to find what they want.

My cat transitioned from indoor/outdoor to indoor-only several years ago when I moved to the city. There was definitely an adjustment period for that, but it didn't take too long for him to be fine."

Looking for something with adult protagonists mostly because most things with teens tend to have some extent of similar story elements I need a break from (""us vs them; grownups don't understand"" moments with adult characters, first crush/romance, recent parental issues, figuring out their future, etc.) and it would be interesting to see a story develop from a more mature POV."

Getting too granular makes it way too complicated. Does anime have to be from Japan? Does it have to be made by Japanese people, or by a ""mostly"" Japanese team? Does it count if it's from Japan, but made by someone who isn't ""racially Japanese""? Does it count if it's not made in Japan, but made by a ""racially Japanese"" person? Does it count if it was made in collaboration with a team from a different country that isn't Japan?
