People tell themselves ""I'll only be happy if I can get that 'better' thing"", but when they achieve or obtain it, they say the exact same phrase again while comparing once again to something greater. It's very rare to see true appreciation of someone's current state."

unpopularopinion,feby41m,t3_eo5bdk,1578964149.0,"Well honestly I think working out when you're young is better. I mean it depends on the situation, but a lot of kids growing up in harsher environments could get killed trying to punch someone who has 40+ lbs on them. A lot of kids that bully others relentlessly tend to come from severely broken homes. If you punch a bully who has alot of weight on you, THEYRE GONNA ESCALATE. The only time punching a bully can work is if you can genuinely do harm to them. So heres my counter:
1. Tell your parents/school. If they dont care about you, try talking to police.
2. Work out. As much as you freaking can. If a bully pushes you, and they end up flying backward, that will stop them even more than trying to fight them.
Theres alot of nuance to this issue and topic, but I think that it's not as simple as just 'hitting back'."

unpopularopinion,fdja2ps,t3_elnciv,1578462885.0,"I agree with this, but I'd like to add more. I think people who are open enough to say they are not educated enough are ridiculed or even shunned on occasion. Honestly, its IMPOSSIBLE to know every facet of extremely complex multi-level issues. Let's take healthcare for example. Even if you study nothing but that subject, you CANT POSSIBLY know EVERY angle. People really need to learn how to speak to each other with respect and compassion. Then on another level, some people are too BUSY to know what's going on. Take myself for example, I used to work 70-105+ hours per WEEK and I had no clue what was even going on in my house lol let alone the world. Sometimes I'd try to clean up and see something new that I've bought or made and don't even remember when I did that."

KitchenConfidential,fdg7kbu,t1_fdg6ruk,1578383311.0,"Godspeed man. I mean it's not completely wasted. You literally have proof that you can outwork 99.9% of the normal people you run into (when I worked in a kitchen I see people get tired at 20 hours into their workweek, while I'm sitting there at hour 60 thinking I gotta crank out a ton of prep and do catering and watch a station during peak hours etc for another 40 hours). Honestly with that in mind I just feel unstoppable. Working on blitz god mode in the culinary field makes you so much tougher than everyone else around you."
KitchenConfidential,fdg5khm,t3_el6t3w,1578380905.0,"Bro. Here's the thing: I don't think passion for cooking ever leaves a person, but I can't agree more with your sentiment. I think the healthiest thing to do is to find an easy job that pays well and then use your free time to volunteer cooking or just cater events for free. As for easy jobs that are well-paying, if you work as hard as a REAL cook/chef does (insane minimum 50 hour week to up very often 100 hours PER WEEK of nonstop backbreaking labor) then ANY JOB outside of that is easy. I spent years cleaning up my kitchen. I got grease, grime, ash, dirt, mystery tar, and a bunch of other unholy crime scene level mess only to have my goddamn coworkers barely put any effort in to keep it that way. Seriously though bro, I literally have gigabytes and gigabytes of me cleaning shit over time. It's insane. Any passerby interested, let me know, ill try to find what I can and post it if anyone wants to see. Goddamn I love cooking, but I fucking hate the type of degenerates that have infested this noble field. Too many people unqualified people end up in a position to be hiring/recruiting are polluting the job title ""chef"" and ""cook"". Yeah man, I worked unholy hours, missed holidays, never hung out with friends, didn't have dinner with my family when they would go out because I'd be in the kitchen cleaning shit, prepping shit, or training staff. It's not worth it."

unpopularopinion,fd2x0wb,t3_ejy056,1578152458.0,"I dont know how to feel about opinions like this. I feel like it's a popular topic people keep bringing up, but from my personal perspective, its unpopular. The reason its unpopular for me is that I rarely go to any reddits that are super polarized. I think that's the reason why so many people think reddit or twitter or any social media is akin to a ""bad place with toxic people"". Like if you go to YouTube and just watch pc building or wood working, I don't really see any of the political, toxic, racist, or whatever kind of poisonous behavior keep talking about. I think this applies to any form of social media. I feel certain categories of things attract certain types of people and this leads to a false belief that may not even reflect reality, but since people immerse themselves in it, it just starts to feel like EVERYTHING is bad."

Pretty sure if every person youd explain this to 'in person' would agree.
