So they just get really angry at women choosing not to sleep with them. They blame everything from their own height to over people's height but fail to recognise it's their own toxic personalities as they feed on each others toxic personalities and slowly grow into a monstrous hive mind of sad and bitter hatred. All this comes out at a belief that sex is a human right and it is the job of ""females"" to give them sex, and the only reason for a ""females"" existence (for some reason they insist on only ever using the word female if they are not using slurs, somehow they have managed to turn the word female into an insult of its own so that's why I used the quotation marks.) They are so angry and bitter that is reaches a point where many advocate rape and even paedophilia. 


To an incel, if you're female and not sleeping with them, you are scum.

If you're female and sleeping with someone that isn't them, you are a slut.

If you're female and are sleeping with them, you are slutty scum that is bullying them.

If you're male and sleeping with people you are chad and therefore scum.

Is been working in the kitchen at a (UK) football stadium which has events on year round but in the off season they couldn't offer me as much work so I got involved with repainting. We are talking the dull stuff. White lines on steps, bathroom floors, the walls of the stadium. If you did the maths, I wouldn't be surprised if the area of painting was several acres.

I needed the money and had a holiday to pay for on top of that so I would get there for eight and leave ten or twelve hours later depending on what I had going on. I had a few good audio books so something to do whilst I worked and it was fairly easy work, all be it repetitive as holy hell.

A group of people who were offered the painting work every year and would take it was the ticket office staff for the stadium. They were also paid hourly but were only interested in seven hours a day and procrastinating as much as they could. One week in, one of the ticket office group banner up to me and asked me to stop working so many hours and also to with slower. And when I said no I wouldn't slow down, they complained to the maintenance manager who was in charge of us all. 

The complaint was that I was doing all the work and would finish too soon whilst they were fucking about all the time. I got a small pay rise and put in charge of the others."
