pokemon,ffdeweq,t3_et08ah,1579819425.0,Perhaps you just like Dragon types. It's still a really strong type despite the addition of fairies during the 6th gen.
wholesomememes,ffde3pr,t3_eswdpt,1579818950.0,This is so true
emulation,ffa0uge,t1_ff9xy6d,1579725612.0,Understood
emulation,ff9j8x8,t3_es5nbi,1579714180.0,Thank you endrift! Keep the good work.
pokemon,ff1aoe7,t3_eqnnct,1579476876.0,"Wow! I did not expect this to recive so many likes and comments. I want to clarify:

I didn't say that all the people who like Sword and Shield are against criticism. Like the idiots who harassed the devs, they are just a part of a bigger community.

I don't hate SW&SH. In fact, i like many concepts introduced by the games myself: I've found the Wild Area to be a pretty interesting place to explore thanks to the Dynamax Pokemon; the permanent EXP. Share, as controversial as is it, is a good QOL improvement for me; and i love the fact that when you are camping, a wild Pokemon can visit and join your party.

Regarding the guy who commented about EA and Disney: They have reason, i couldn't think on a better example back yesterday.  But now the case of No Man's Sky is coming to my mind. It recived a lot of backlash back on the day for lacking many features that were expected (Multiplayer for example). And the devs end adding them. Not only that, but they improved things that were criticized like the small inventory and the bland enviroment.

Thank you all for giving your opinions and i'm glad to see that most people commented civilly and with respect."
pokemon,fev7ce0,t1_fev0byq,1579394004.0,"Yes, i was talking about real time combat.

I agree. In others RPG, like FFVI, when an attack hits multiple targets they loose HP simultaneously. I wish they would implement this in a future game."
pokemon,feus7o7,t1_feulu0r,1579389414.0,"I think they can improve the combat if they put more emphasis on double and triple battles, something like the GameCube titles or the doubles in competitive. Revamping it from the scratch is far more complex tho, and GF will need more time than they usually have."
pokemon,feunyaq,t3_eqjcaz,1579388377.0,I like Serperior's desing but Emboar's and Samurott's look too complex for my taste. I prefer Pignite's and Dewott's simpler aproach.
wholesomememes,fdtij3l,t1_fdtbq3h,1578717254.0,"Mine destroyed my garden, my old bike, and bathed on my pool. Now he lives with my grandparents on their farm. He still plays with me like when he was a puppy. He is really lovely."
wholesomememes,fdt9nn1,t3_emxf5l,1578713735.0,Golden Retrivers are so adorable
pokemon,fds833l,t1_fds5sk9,1578696488.0,"I agree with that. If GF had delayed the game and given the devs more time, all the cut Pokemon would be coded since day one. It sucks, but at least they are bringing back some of them. Let's see if they can redeem themselves and add the remaining."
IncelTears,fdrtkbo,t3_emrng6,1578689553.0,"What a fucking asshole, nobody deserves to expirience such level of harassment. And the fact that she was so young make this even worse. Poor girl."
