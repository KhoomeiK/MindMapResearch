AskMen,ffh051k,t1_ffglvi3,1579919559.0,It was pretty hard for me to get over the misogyny. I know it’s a “time-piece” in that regard but it’s still tough to stomach in this day and age.
AskMen,ffgztsz,t1_ffgcqgt,1579919325.0,I feel like it was less her and more her writing and how much they nerfed the doctor. They made him so dumb and unempathetic. She was like teaching him how to be the doctor even though he’s at his most experienced ever
AskMen,ffgzmc0,t1_fffgpju,1579919168.0,I’m glad someone else agrees. It was like a 5/10 for me. They took all the bits people liked and made that the entire show.

politics,ff9883j,t1_ff8vcfo,1579707111.0,"Idk if 538 accounts for the momentum swing that usually occurs after winning the first couple primary states. A lot people believe Biden’s appeal will diminish if he loses to Bernie in several states. One of Biden’s biggest appeals is that he is touted as the most likely to beat Trump which is very attractive to a lot of voters. If Bernie seems to be looking better, many believe those voters will jump to him. So yeah, a lot of it is based on hope and expectations although they’re not that unrealistic."
