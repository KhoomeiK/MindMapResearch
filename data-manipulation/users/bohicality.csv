bipolar,fgflrht,t3_ey6iba,1580742119.0,"Definitely speak to your psychiatrist about this as it's a symptom of your depression. Mine records all my off-kilter behaviour so we have a baseline of where I'm at.

When I'm bad I don't shower either, will occasionally go without brushing my teeth and will grab the previous day's clothes off the floor as getting fresh clothes out of the wardrobe is too difficult. 

You're definitely not alone with this :)"
Guitar,fgem465,t3_exiyc7,1580702958.0,"Another vote for the Helix. I use mine with my Shuriken in a covers band, running straight into the mixer. It does everything I need for all genres we play. 

The bonus for me is that it's very simple set up, unlike our other guitarist who has to have a second guitar for alt tunings, full pedal board, amp and mic. 

It'll never sound quite as good as a decent analogue set up, but that's not something an audience will ever notice."
bipolar,ff8v3uv,t3_es6le4,1579697118.0,"I found that the combination of Seroquel and Mirtazapine fuelled my hypomania and I was rapid cycling, flipping moods every few days and ended up with some hideous mixed states. 

I came off those quickly (with a month of brain zaps) and ended up on lithium and quetiapine. The lithium has worked well in preventing hypomanic episodes, but the depression is now hitting for weeks at a time. 

I'm starting on Lamictal as well as my psychiatrist says that its biggest impact is on the depression. 

td;dr Lamictal great for depression (allegedly) and Lithium to know the edge of the highs and create general stability."
legaladvice,ff8s92y,t1_ff8aups,1579694083.0,Games industry veteran here. This is the correct answer. I can't think of a single game that provides a dual entitlement to play on different platforms (apart the Xbox + PC in Game Pass - and that's a subscription service).
bipolar,ff6haku,t1_ff4e9yr,1579627184.0,Cool! I start tomorrow (in addition to Lithium and quetiapine). Good luck!
Line6Helix,ff6g0fp,t1_ff6cdno,1579626389.0,"Ok. I'm staring at that patch with my Shuriken on my lap. No problem changing models. The Preset Variax tuning setting is set to 'don't force' which disabled custom tuning but that, as far as I can tell, is it. Not sure what Variax you have, but there's usually a light under the model select knob. Make sure yours is on, I stacked a solo a gig last month trying to work out where my tone had gone and it turned out my guitar had switched itself off when I changed patches."
Line6Helix,ff6c79m,t1_ff1rj2n,1579624009.0,Have you checked the input block to make sure it's set to Variax or multi?

Guitar,fe18fk5,t3_ene6d1,1578823739.0,"I switched to Kilq Aircell padded straps when I developed a herniation in my neck. They do a good job, for a conventional strap, of distributing weight and helped me immensely."

Guitar,fcwziet,t3_ej4gq1,1578044422.0,"Guitarist here with a C4/5 herniation. It took around three years to sort this out with PT. During that time I played my Ibanez (SIX6FDFM) almost exclusively. The combination of light weight and slim Wizard neck meant I could carry on playing and gigging without causing any further issue. I also used a wide gel-pad strap to further distribute the load. 

Also pay attention to your posture when practicing - bending forward to look at the fretboard when you're playing is not good for your herniation. 

If you want a cheaper option, the Steinberger Spirit is another guitar that weighs next to nothing with an easily accessed fretboard. You'll look like a refugee from the 80s but, hey, at least you'll be playing guitar."
