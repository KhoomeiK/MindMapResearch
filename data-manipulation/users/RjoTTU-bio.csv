iamverysmart,ffiusyj,t3_etsjv3,1579983262.0,"The only time you should ever ""brag"" about your grad degree is if you get published in a reputable journal. Bragging about a degree is like bragging about having a driver's license but no car."
Anxiety,fedp4gq,t3_eohpso,1579016837.0,"One thing that helped me was knowing that other people are working at night, especially in healthcare. 


We stay up all night knowing that people will be sick, anxious, and exhausted but we are here for you if you need us."
pharmacy,fe3o5s5,t1_fe2xck6,1578851235.0,"I know my area is a factor (Bible belt), but I feel like my coworkers are even more churchy than average."
HistoryMemes,fe2srpy,t3_enl46r,1578842428.0,The downfall of the history channel was my justification for quitting cable.

YouShouldKnow,fdk6d49,t1_fdk25z6,1578497096.0,"I think you're right. My techs do all the billing stuff, but I'll ask my PIC next time I'm at work. I'm in Texas if that makes a difference. I don't think we can override a DAW1."
PrePharmacy,fdjw6w3,t3_elovzf,1578489487.0,Why CVS?
YouShouldKnow,fdj0mts,t1_fdiwr84,1578455427.0,"Good question. Not all generics are made the same, but with our wholesaler we have preferred generics which are of good quality and price. I work in the outpatient retail setting, so to us it isn't a huge concern generally. It may be a bigger concern in a hospital setting with more dangerous drugs, or ones with a narrow therapeutic index (effective dose and toxic dose are close together). 


Long story short, there is a reference that is built into our software that will warn you if you substitute a good brand/generic with one that is not as good."
YouShouldKnow,fdivt13,t1_fdiszey,1578452168.0,"So for us to fill brand the prescriber would have to write ""brand necessary"" or ""substitution not permitted"". We fill for generic unless the doctor or patient specifies brand. The patient can choose generic even if the doctor writes ""brand necessary"". 

I can provide examples if that isn't clear. I would say about 95% of the time a generic is dispensed."
YouShouldKnow,fdia1sp,t3_elhunv,1578438444.0,"Pharmacist here. The generics may exist, but it always takes time for the wholesaler to supply them, and for the insurance to start covering the new generic. 


Also, some HIV clinics/specialty pharmacies will carry brand name HIV meds because they qualify for special state grants and programs. In that case the brand will be cheaper and the generic will be unavailable. 


If you ever have billing questions please feel free to ask us at the pharmacy, we are happy to help."
aww,fdhz1va,t3_elf7t9,1578432761.0,I was surprised by the number of stray dogs/cats in Greece. They were all well taken care of and fed though. We had to stop and pet every dog while we were there since we missed ours so bad.
CasualConversation,fdcrcan,t1_fdcq1gi,1578282136.0,"I have some general advice and personal as well. Have a plan A, B, and C for major life decisions. Plan C is something that is guaranteed that would require little effort and would be an acceptable fallback. Plan B is something you would enjoy, but isn't your dream. Plan A would require more effort and is the thing you would most enjoy. 


Plan A could be engineering, B could be teaching, and C could be working at your friends taco stand. No matter what decision you make, you can always reroute at a later date and work back towards plan A. 


In terms of dating, I have been in love at least 5 times. 3 times I was broken up with, 1 time I did the breaking up, 1 is who I am currently with. With each relationship you learn new things about yourself and love. If a relationship ends, you don't start at zero in the next one, but instead start from a point of wisdom. In the long run, an unhappy relationship is a big drain, and should end. Just be real with your partner. Communicate and articulate your thoughts as clearly as possible. If it is right, it will last."
CasualConversation,fdcqb49,t3_eknylc,1578281367.0,Sweet. I am fortunate that I seem to find them at the right times in my life. I'm up to 3 now.
CasualConversation,fdcq43k,t1_fdcpjj3,1578281224.0,"School can be tough. Your social circle is huge in school so it becomes almost like a chore. I think for me, confidence involved having many meaningful interactions with people. I mean, you can try to be friends with everyone, get good grades, walk around like you have a 10'' dick, but really in the end the stuff that people remember at your 10 year reunion is the way you communicate with others. 


When your social circle shrinks down after school, and all you have are memories, it is better to have genuine ones, even if they make you cringe sometimes."
CasualConversation,fdcpg79,t3_eknt2d,1578280734.0,"I think confidence is a double edged sword. You put yourself too far out there, and some people won't like you. Don't put yourself out there enough and nobody will know who you are. As you get older you stop caring about people not liking you and you just get to be you. 


What situations are you questioning your confidence in?"
CasualConversation,fdcp975,t3_eknurk,1578280591.0,"What kind of decisions are you talking about? Decisions that effect only you (job, education, health, finances), or decisions that effect relationships around you such as dating, friendships etc?


Also, what do you mean by stagnant?"

WatchPeopleDieInside,fcymo7r,t3_ejirpd,1578082870.0,"Mega elite pro tip. If you are ever in a class and you are dropping an exam/quiz or you know you majorly bombed it, do not be the first person to turn it in. 


The Prof will likely look at your paper to see how you did and assess his exam based on your answers. Then when he realizes everyone else knows what they are doing,  you will be memorialized in their mind as a complete dumbass. Turn yours in later so a grad student grades it or something."
Gastritis,fcjbmwy,t3_ehfr2j,1577682275.0,"Pharmacist here. I recommend you do the Protonix as directed for at least a couple weeks. If you want to quit after 2 weeks, take them every other day for the remaining 6 you have. The drug you are on is well studied and is very effective, but PPIs in general are no longer recommended long term. Your doctor is right in writing you a 20 day supply, and I think the benefits outweigh the risks. 

H2 blockers have their place in therapy, and you should discuss those with your doctor after a couple weeks IMO."
