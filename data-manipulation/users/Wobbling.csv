baldursgate,fctby8x,t1_fcsgj83,1577938510.0,"This happens to me on Switch and I have some experience playing the normal game so I think I have the answer for you.

The issue is that your characters are out of agro range when you commit everyone to the target. 

What happens when *that* target dies is that they seem to look for their next target based on *where they came from* when the attack order was issued, not *where they are standing now*.

So they find no new target near their original positions, and walk back.

My work around is to just move the party forward a bit for trash encounters where I want the AI to handle the fight. For tough encounters I turn the AI off anyway with the Left Trigger menu and issue all orders manually in between lots of pauses - something you'll need to get used to anyway for this game!
