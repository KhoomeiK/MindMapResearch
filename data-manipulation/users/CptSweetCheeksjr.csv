aww,fetsfhy,t1_fete0ov,1579379507.0,"I guess in my eyes you need to put in work everyday to be a good dog owner. Chinchillas are like anything else, you get out of them what you put in. 

You're right though, you can can get away with a lot more with other pets like dogs or cats."
aww,fete065,t1_fet3nbw,1579374408.0,"I used to breed them as a hobby in highschool. They require a lot of your time if you want them to be a good pet, but they're a blast to have"
aww,fetdqnj,t1_fet8hh7,1579374316.0,"They're a lot of work, but if you let them out to play every single day, you can change their sleep pattern and really tone down how loud and annoying they can be at night.

They can be really fulfilling pets, but you have to spend a shit load of time with them or else they turn into sucks, but if you do put in the effort they're really sweet and companionable."
aww,fetc81i,t1_fesrwun,1579373816.0,"I used to breed chinchillas, they're not much more maintenance than a higher energy dog. 

I had one client buy a chinchilla that hated being touched and was a total recluse. She later sent me a video of her walking through Walmart with it perched on her shoulder, and doing other tricks.

You can train them to do stuff and they can form a strong bond with people, you just have to put in the work everyday, but it's super rewarding, and they have huge distinctive personalities.

I think the biggest downside is you have to watch them like a hawk or else they'll chew and destroyed anything and everything when they're out of their enclosure."

I would do a few grain jars, you can use brown rice just fine, once the jars are done I'd move over to a shoe box Tek.

TIHI,fdxc6n2,t1_fdvrklu,1578767325.0,"I used to have dandruff so bad that it would creep on to my hair line and you could see my skin getting flakey. It would get really bad in the winter, like I grew my hair out to hide my forehead bad. 

The white and blue regular formula head and shoulders bottles are meh at best. You need to buy the blue and orange clinical strength bottles. They use different medications in the clinical strength bottles.

There was a large and noticable difference just after one use. After the 2nd or 3rd day it was like I'd never had dandruff from hell. I started using it last winter, haven't had a single flake so far this winter."
