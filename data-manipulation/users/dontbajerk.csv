NoStupidQuestions,feebb7m,t1_fee2suf,1579030231.0,"Deductible is the amount you have to pay before insurance covers anything.  So if you break a leg with a $3000 deductible and it cost $5000 to fix (made up numbers), your insurance would cover $2000 of it.  It might be worth noting this is usually for the entire year.  That is - in a calendar year, if you had three separate accidents costing $5000 each, you only cover the deductible the one time, so insurance would cover 100% of it (or 90%, or whatever your insurance covers) once the deductible amount was paid."

Depends on what qualifies as porn.  There were erotic moving pictures very very early, but what might be called hardcore took a bit longer.  As in, like 10-15 years.  It's not completely certain as a lot of early stuff was lost due to how easily destroyed early film is (highly flammable, etc).  There was also erotic/boudoir photography way before that."

Someone could readily make insulin the way they did 25 years ago, the new patents wouldn't apply.

Just slapped it all together and that was that.  I gather the film was basically not really even released for decades, by that point no one may have cared to fix it.

However, it might be worth a note there's a director's cut with digital grain reduction and tweaked audio - it's much newer obviously, and maintains most of the edit order, so at the very least he clearly prefers the incoherent order now."

Slight trivia, Ted Levine wasn't the original voice, and the guy he replaced also looks way different than the actor who physically played Rusty Nail (the physical likeness I assume is a stunt man or something, you barely even see him, but he's a big burly guy).  They have a clip of the original voice on the DVD, and whoever it was, they were not nearly as good as Ted Levine who has an incredibly menacing voice."

This means they can't have a bunch of extras spread out much as the maximum size is relatively small, which makes it look bad when there is supposed to be an ambush but they're all kind of squished together in one small area and can't really make it look bigger very effectively, exacerbating the issue."

In adjusted dollars, it had a budget of around $500,000.  

These days, hundreds of people crank out films for 1/10th of that regularly.  They'll look cheap too, but they can manage it relatively well.  Comparable to Dolemite budget, many films in a comparable budget range also look MUCH better made now - films like Napoleon Dynamite, Brick, Bronson, Monsters, Tangerine, etc.  It helps when like 80% of your budget doesn't have go to film and developing costs."

Yeah, knowing that is a big part of the reason I like Costco.
