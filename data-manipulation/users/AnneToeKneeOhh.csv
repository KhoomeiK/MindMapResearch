lonely,ff1k3kp,t3_er2fz1,1579480455.0,"I’m in the same situation. For a long time my “friends” were just people I’d smoke weed with in a car. All of em long time high school buddies but after a good 8 years a single one never took the time to actually get to know me. I’m a certified mechanic now and always willing to lend a hand, even to strangers. So naturally I’d always get a weekly call from one of em. They’d run out of gas, need a bulb replaced, need an oil change, etc. But whenever it came to wanting to hangout I’d get ghosted. I’d try to make plans to go to a movie, maybe a bar or even just meet up for lunch. Rarely would I even get a text back, hell I’d appreciate getting turned down more than no reply at all. But recently I’ve quit smoking and other “mainstream” drugs. I expected to see them less. Haven’t seen or heard from a single one in weeks (unless it’s 2 am and they’re trying to get me pitch on other drugs). Still once or twice I tried to make some evening plans, to be met with the same no reply result. Though I was decently ridiculed by one when I brought up that I’d grown tired of the same routine we’d been running for years. Anyways I’ve always alone, more so now than before. But I’ve always been extremely introverted so much hasn’t changed. I guess apart from getting that off my chest, I just wanna say you’re not alone... in your struggle."

I also really don’t have the time or care to go out of my way and research the current meta and replay strikes till my thumbs chafe for god rolls. Erentil is ok, but there’s a reason it’s not overused like mindbenders. You get a couple long shots here and there but it’s fairly inconsistent so it deters me from engaging at midrange. Sure I can draw you closer but mindbenders still have the advantage, imo. And I never said shotgunning as a whole takes no skill, lord of wolves and a good chaperone user puts me in my place every day of the week. And as far as pellet shotguns go, I suppose you’re right. But I still think a certain amount of pellets, maybe not the majority, should still land in the head/neck area for a one shot."
