offmychest,fec6b4a,t3_eobw92,1578967360.0,I know this probably sucks to go through and I hope one day you can just brush it off (even though I know it’s hard). People can be really ignorant when it comes to a lot of things. BTW I’m a 6’6 guy and  from the way you’re described I’d try to holla ;p
AmItheAsshole,fdx698a,t1_fdx0l64,1578765719.0,I agree. But nah it’s just certain meats
AmItheAsshole,fdx64av,t1_fdwz77q,1578765671.0,There’s a possibility. Who knows? I’ll just have to go in to the doctors office to figure out what’s going on
AmItheAsshole,fdx5on3,t1_fdx0jnu,1578765549.0,It happens with any type of meat that isn’t processed and as far as fish it’s usually just salmon that does it.
AmItheAsshole,fdx0njo,t1_fdwyqm9,1578764140.0,This seems like the right answer. I honestly don’t even want them discussing this anymore

offmychest,fdm1kya,t3_em38z7,1578537630.0,"What should you do? 
Step 1: stop crying
Step 2: take your ass to the field and put in some work
Step 3: do this everyday and recreate yourself
Step 4: watch everyone’s habits in practice and know their flaws
Step 5: proceed to make everyone look stupid in tryouts next year and make the team
Behind every success is tons of failures"

offmychest,fdll7yw,t3_dx7di1,1578526537.0,You need to chill and get out of the house and your mind will change
unpopularopinion,fcy6euc,t3_ejib6f,1578075435.0,I’m pretty sure it comes down to your sexuality. Also women tend to be pretty aggressive towards other women.
AmItheAsshole,fcy53x6,t1_fcvade0,1578074949.0,OP was offended asked him to stop and he kept doing it. Why keep taking that abuse? He doesn’t have to take that.
unpopularopinion,fcww3vo,t3_ej9gis,1578040087.0,You can still wear a lot of that stuff now
unpopularopinion,fcwv7c0,t3_ejc3uc,1578038980.0,Agreed. It’s good but it’s not THAT good. I don’t get why people cry over this movie. I always thought toy story 1-3 was 10x better. When I tell people this they get pissed
