He actually loved it, but I don't know if you guys are mushy like that."

We had 3 brothers (60's) living in my neighbourhood, they never married and still lived at home with their mom. All fine until mom died. They started hoarding, the only place they went was to the local variety store. They were not bathing and stunk so badly everyone would leave the store when they came in. People talked to local groups about them, but because no one had been in their house, no one had any proof about how they were living. Until one brother fell and broke his hip. They had to dig through the hoard to get to him and obviously the EMT's reported their living conditions. The house was in such bad shape that it had to be torn down, and they lost everything they were trying to hold onto. This outcome is what you're trying to prevent. They are lucky to have you in their life."

If the patient decides they don't want to transition, they stop the blockers and puberty will naturally come on. No different than the people that go through puberty later in life because of genetics."
relationship_advice,ff3rola,t3_erg0qr,1579547393.0,"My son came out as trans around 15 as well. He switched to a male name and started dressing male at that time. He took something to stop menstruation, but opted to wait on testosterone until he turned 18. My son is now 22 and had his top surgery this past year. The main difference I find in him is how much happier he is, and how much more confident he is. My son was extremely lucky in that almost everyone in his life was accepting of him. It is a struggle sometimes to get used to the new pronouns and name, but as long as your son sees you are trying, it will be fine. There are a several support groups in Facebook for LGBTQ parents, and you may be able to find parents in your area who would be more helpful with local groups and what medical care is available. If you ever have any questions, or just need to talk please don't hesitate to message me if needed."

They are different children and will progress at their own rate. I have 3 kids, 2 were very outgoing, loved everyone. The third was incredibly shy, rarely spoke, terrified of people. Guess which kid could read at age 2? Just because they are not vocalizing it, doesn't mean they are not taking it in. Let your daughter progress at her own rate and ignore your mother."
