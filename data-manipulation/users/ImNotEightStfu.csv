SuicideWatch,fcfed13,t3_eh1btb,1577629097.0,"Aww, I'm so happy for you! I used to collect stuffed animals too, always had a cat to keep me safe while I slept. I feel sad and nostalgic now that I've grown up and had to give most of them away.

Hold on to what makes you happy, good luck with everything, enjoy the rest of the holidays as much as you can!"
