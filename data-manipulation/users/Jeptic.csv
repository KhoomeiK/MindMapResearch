science,ffi3xec,t1_ffhug75,1579964369.0,What if they were to have it in a hollow point bullet inside the bullet. When the bullet hits the target it splits open and delivers the poison. Not that anyone needs ideas to kill people more efficiently

politics,ff9ytf2,t1_ff9sjtn,1579724424.0,Its not so much the bullshit rolling off the train its that the good ole GOP are busily sweeping up saying nothing to see here. They are the ones who are truly despicable.
Breadit,ff9d5jf,t3_es9tpw,1579710382.0,That was well done - both video and bread. I would so look forward to your time lapse of a a brioche

sousvide,feddm2l,t1_febthqo,1579008551.0,Hey. So new to the sous vide thing. Why not use a pot? Did a quick google and first few results said it was ok.
AdviceAnimals,fe6uirh,t1_fe6q3gk,1578905597.0,"Get up at four and quietly stand a little behind him. When the game lulls, speak softly and creepily, ""I burned a ps4 once. The kid just cried and cried and cried."" Chuckle and go back to bed. Then burn his console/PC the next morning."
GifRecipes,fdngged,t1_fdnd6ks,1578585281.0,How about if the inner basket was lined with the same cheesecloth or thick paper towels... Have to try this next time I make rosties.
WTF,fdng2lm,t1_fdn5kf2,1578585049.0,"I dunno. From everything I've seen on MTV's only television show, Ridiculousness, this could have easily taken place anywhere in the great US of A with plenty beer and free time on hand."

Every flipping thing you said - from the clickbait first daughter to the 'haha here's your real prize second offspring' rings true.  And the scary thing is, I think he's winning. We're just in this to save some face."
atheism,fdinriz,t1_fdh0h09,1578447020.0,"The reality is that there will be no pope that will be out on a Pride Parade float - not in the foreseeable future at least. He cannot be that liberal as he would not have been elected. Notwithstanding that, he is markedly different from Benedict ""condoms won't stop the spread of AIDS in Africa"" XVI - at least by Roman Catholic standards. The church is a massive ship and to turn it around would take time and a lot of power."
atheism,fddutvu,t1_fdd5rje,1578324524.0,"This comes up time and again and I think to add to that, you have someone who's understanding and expression of their own sexuality is stunted at about an adolescent level. It may be a reason that they are drawn to young boys. It is very possible that the they're just plain ole evil"
Naturalhair,fddg0b6,t3_eknr1u,1578310612.0,Yup yup yup. Everyone has to pay attention to their hair type though. 4c and 3a have different journeys. I find youtube has been especially helpful in not just health for hair but style advice. Plunk in your hair type and see what's out there.
politics,fcnvbaq,t1_fcnsl4x,1577819145.0,"I am curious as to the wait times in the lines. During the Georgia elections, I saw lines rounding buildings in what looked like predominantly black areas (many people of colour in the lines). Was it the same across the state or did the suburban areas have lesser wait time?"
