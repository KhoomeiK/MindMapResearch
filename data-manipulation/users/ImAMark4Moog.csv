Malazan,fg0pqvd,t1_fg0pcec,1580412621.0,Describing an novel of Malazan as a horror is just plain wrong. It's like describing Led Zeppelin as prog rock. It's just genre conventions.

Malazan,ffzd3uc,t1_ffz6j7h,1580373028.0,"Yeah dude. Big strong rapist absolutely fails me. I could see a redemption ark but it's not panning out. Five and a half books in. In bonehunters he blames rape on the oil, despite raping women without it literally two books ago. That's not good writing. Either that or the character fails me because he is blatanly lying to himself. I'm not through six yet but honestly this guy seems set up to to ZOMG badass and it reminded me of LARP."

Malazan,ffz2p3v,t1_ffx8hw5,1580362011.0,"This fails me - to be honest, Karsa fails me too because he is written in the context of what other authors have written. This is a serious flaw of Malazan and Id challenge you to contend otherwise. It has a fantastic overarching plot, but it's ambitigouity shrouds the parts of it that are very derivative."

Games,ffyyrlr,t1_ffyd4dz,1580358643.0,"Honestly the same people that are going to complain about the cinematics being not reworked are the same people that wil tell you that blizzards storylines are why they dont play blizzard games.   


All I care about in an RTS is the gameplay. If they updated the models and the FX then thats pretty good. I understand some animations don't have the diversity but I am not paying too much attention to those in an isometric gameplay.   


Reddit outcrying over this is a combination of it being fadish to hate on blizzard and also just an intersecction of younger gamers who view the RTS genre as outdated and don't play it."
Games,ffyygto,t1_ffy3gs6,1580358404.0,"Blizzard is just fine, they just make safe games. You don't have to like them. I haven't bought one of theirs in a while but this hyperbole is hilarious. Diablo III was serviceable, SC2 was good. As a community gamers seem to think that if they aren't putting out auteur-level indie push-the-envelope games they are POS companies. Yet the same time they scream at Frictional for putting monsters in SOMA and criticize it for being a ""walking simulator."" I am really annoyed that we are deciding to focus negative attention on ""this nearly 20-year-old game was not updated to MY STANDARDS."" Get over yourselves, guys."
Games,ffyy86k,t1_ffxk7p5,1580358215.0,"Its a rendered cutscene clearly in-engine for both cuts. I sincerely believe that the remaster was toned back specifically because that what they showed at 2018 does NOT remind me of warcraft three. Blizzard could certainly do it, this is a design choice.

educationalgifs,ffyovuw,t1_ffxxs4n,1580351569.0,"Being a barista is tougher than being a bartender with less pay. It's no wonder there is no education behind the drinks because being a barista is not a valid long-term career path in a society. If you don't have long-term career paths for people in a hobby/proffession, then knowledge often doesn't proliferate widely about the topic. Results in generational ignorance - especially in our society where convenience often dictates the food sector."
