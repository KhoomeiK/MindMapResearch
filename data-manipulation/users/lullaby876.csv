You can do it. It just takes a lot of sacrifices. I also don't require much of a social life as I never had much of one to begin with. So that helped. Additionally, I've worked most of the time through my college career. I kind of enjoy discipline and pain."

Adopting correct posture as an adult will help a lot of things, and might change your appearance slightly. However, it won't cause dramatic changes in your appearance if you're over the age of 25. It's still worth doing though."

That's why I said they'd be able to tell."
amiugly,ff4fybv,t1_ff47k29,1579562675.0,"I look much thinner in those pictures, and I look noticeably tired, at least in my opinion. Additionally, those pictures were taken right after I started to get better (the week of starting medication). I already said I probably didn't choose the right pictures. What gets me is that a person would think one or two nights of stress would move a person to post about it like this. 
But no, definitely months of compounded sleep deprivation and stress, admittedly amplified in the first picture of this series. I couldn't take a picture like that now if I tried, but I admit there's no way for me to prove that without taking ""equal"" pictures."

amiugly,feo0cgl,t1_fenzocm,1579293438.0,A lot of people are really cruel when it comes to insecurity. I believe that I’m defective too.

DysmorphicDisorder,felo97j,t3_epq4o8,1579226923.0,I don’t even know. I think accepting that you’re average and not beautiful is just as difficult as accepting you’re hideous. People don’t treat you the same when you aren’t beautiful. But we have our personalities. Those can be beautiful. That’s what I tell myself.

college,feeauok,t1_fee5gn1,1579029963.0,"Sure, but really many engineering curriculums are designed so there's a lot of information to be absorbed and only a portion of it can be understood.

college,fee543y,t3_eomjwv,1579026581.0,"As an engineering student with heavy courseloads, I usually find myself studying more often than not. I split up my time by what needs to be done. If it needs to be done, I do it immediately. If two things are due at the same time, I do the one worth the most points first. My efficiency has skyrocketed over time. I used to procrastinate somewhat, not write down detailed and organized notes, fail to do reading at times, and skip corners.

Sleep is more important than schoolwork. It's a hard pill to swallow, but too had to learn that lesson. Don't spend all your time napping obviously, but sleeping a full night instead of stressing out all night tying up loose ends isn't worth it. The quality of your work WILL be worse, and you WILL be less efficient in the long run. Your health is more important than an A, and that A will get harder to achieve if you are unhealthy, not easier. I know it's easy to trick yourself into thinking otherwise."
