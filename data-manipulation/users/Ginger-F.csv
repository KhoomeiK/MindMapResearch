worldnews,feoatfz,t1_feo2u9b,1579297501.0,"I agree. I live in a Labour stronghold in NE England and also happen to work with the elderly on a daily basis, the vast majority are *staunch* Labour supporters that hate the Tories with a passion, but they also tend to hold views and opinions that could be considered quite regressive, I believe it's just the sum of their life experience after being raised in less progressive and liberal times.

It's sad, but when people reach a certain point in their lives they usually struggle to retain and learn new ideas so they end up 'locked' and left behind a bit, the short term memory often starts to fade but the long term is still sharp as a razor, it's most obvious with things like technology, but I reckon it also applies to societal and cultural changes and political issues too."

Hear me out, he's flashing 2 and 3 with his fingers, Draxler's squad number is 23 so clearly he's signalling that we're signing him.

There's also a big chance that we're signing Tiago Silva (#2) and Presnel Kimpembe (#3), because we all know Woodward plays 3d chess and thinks on a different level to us plebs.

But wait, it gets better! 2+3=5, Marquinhos (#5) is coming as well, the madman has actually gone and bought PSGs entire back line on a whim, the Glazers will be fuming when they see what their favourite money man has done to the company credit card!

Holy fuck! WE'RE SIGNING MARCO VERRATTI! Woody has evolved to 4d chess, 2x3=6, #6 is Verratti. This is a day of days! Muppets everywhere are wanking themselves into a spunk coma!

Barristan calls for Jorah to mount up and ride to safety with Dany while he holds off the horde, Jorah reluctantly agrees and tosses Heartsbane to him, wight after wight after wight is felled by Barristan the Bold until a handful of the Night King's Liutenants strut up to the scene, in their arrogance they assume he is just a wounded old man and one peels off from the group to have his sport with him, but is turned to cold dust in moments, the rest are furious and attack, but Barristan shows them why is the greatest knight of the era and takes down several in a furious fight, Heartsbane shattering one after another until finally the Night King arrives and pierces Barristan through the heart with a javelin of ice. He dies with a sword in hand and a smile on his lips, the last thing he sees is Dany escaping to safety, he has fulfilled his vow and his greatest wish, he was a Knight of the Queensguard, and he died as one."

After a great book, movie, TV show or videogame finishes I often go through a really intense period of  obsession where I can't stop thinking and daydreaming about characters, events, and places I've just seen or imagined; the best way I can describe the feeling is some combination of loss, longing, or mourning, before I can move on to something else I always do this, I have no fucking idea why. I'm an avid reader, but after a particularly good book sometimes I just can't pick up another story for weeks or months until I've processed everything in my head.
