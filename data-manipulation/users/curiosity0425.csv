AskReddit,fet3vhu,t1_fesv6n7,1579371576.0,"Omigod, this happened to me once when I was a kid. My aunt was so excited to have us all watch a movie on HBO. This was at a time when HBO was brand-new and she was the only person we knew to even have it yet. To watch a movie without commercials that was previously only seen in the theater was really cool and unique, so we were all excited and honored to be sitting in her living room to watch this movie with her. 

So, here's little 9 or 10 year-old me, who had never seen more than Bambi and Grease in the movie theater. I somehow knew what was going to happen in each scene of this first-run film on HBO. I can't remember what movie it actually was, but everyone was freaked out when I could tell them exactly what they were going to see in the next scene. Before anyone says, ""it was probably an older movie that you watched on regular TV before."" I can tell you, it wasn't. That's why we were all freaked out.  

It never happened again though - and I can't figure out how it happened in the first place."
