wow,ff5hyo5,t1_ff4iyup,1579593707.0,But it is account wide right? Just not cross faction.
facepalm,ff4arf4,t1_ff3lsy5,1579559267.0,"Oh reeeally Captain Obvious, I had no clue.... 
Also, the cartoon character refers to the diamond in the movie, it has everything to do with it."

facepalm,ff2xiy7,t1_ff2u0o0,1579527781.0,"Sure my dude!\^\^ My comment was kind of a joke, (even if it's technically true).Even the animated Pink Panther (atleast originally) refers to the diamond.

I mean the original comment are kind of a stretch, since it's clearly an animated **panther** and not a lion, and even if lions ""technically"" belong to the panther family. The Pink Panther is NOT a lion. :P"
facepalm,ff2ly98,t1_ff2di0x,1579512463.0,"The real facepalm is not realizing that the ""Pink Panther"" is actually a diamond. As seen in the movie [The Pink Panther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pink_Panther_(1963_film)) *""the ""Pink Panther"", the largest diamond in the world"".* So not a feline at all."
pathofexile,fdvqvu9,t1_fdvbsht,1578750480.0,And the reason you never do that is basically because of bad game design... I'm not sure why you think adapting to bad design is an excuse for it? Would it not make more sense if instakill abilities was visible on the screen? So you could react and dodge?
pathofexile,fdv9sb9,t1_fdv43b4,1578745080.0,"Yea that must be it, everyone else is always wrong and you are always right. So weird huh?  The only truth here is that he died to poor game mechanics."
pathofexile,fdjvuum,t1_fdjsyls,1578489190.0,"Is this really a fact or just what you think is the case?   
Because my understand is that they continuously release new content to keep people interested, and with every new league there is a big surge of interest in the game because of that.   


I dont't really see how improving delve would affect this in any way? Probably the other way around actually. I would have yet another reason to play if they made delve better, and the same is true for everyone else as well I suppose. Delve is a cool concept that imo could be ""more fun"" than mapping if they just added some content to it. RNG is a big part of the game already, and to be fair they could probably tweak it so that racers would not be all that affected anyway."
wow,fd649vi,t3_ek15yf,1578185323.0,"Many years ago I played alot of Monk in D3, and it so happened that I started to watch Quin69 (a Twitch streamer), because he played the same class (monk) and also the same specc (at the time). I continued to watch alot of Quin until I stopped playing D3. Some years passed and with the release of Legion I got back into Wow (which I had not played since Cata). And for some reason I saw that Quin was streaming, but not Diablo as he always was, but Wow. So I hopped into the stream.... Same race, gender, class and specc... I guess we have similar taste. :P"
Watercolor,fclmzvp,t3_ehtev7,1577751605.0,"Wow, this might be the coolest watercolor painting I have ever seen. **Amazing** job! 

Edit: Where can I find your tutorials when they are finished btw? :)"
pics,fba634o,t1_fb9hi3j,1576666502.0,"Definitely the right choice!   
Sure it's a hard choice, but if you love your pet you need to be able to let them go when it's time.  If your pet is old and sick it's only selfish to try and extend it's life.   


Had to put our 19 y/o cat down this summer, and it was super sad, and we could probably have gotten maybe a few more years out of him. But this was best **for him**. Now I can look back and know he lived the best possible life without any suffering."
