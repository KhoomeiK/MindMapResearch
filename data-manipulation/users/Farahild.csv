badwomensanatomy,ffxit3d,t1_ffxfjy4,1580325995.0,"But then you don't need an excuse, do you? Just that is reason enough.

Also, do you not have water saving toilets?"
badwomensanatomy,ffwxurn,t1_ffwvcs6,1580313463.0,In my experience (even with guys who are pretty hygienic otherwise) none of them use toilet paper after a pee. But I'm not a man so I'm sure there's a few out there who do ;)
badwomensanatomy,ffwxrbe,t3_evmqo8,1580313404.0,But *why* would you not flush. I literally can't think of any reason why I ever would want to not flush.

TryingForABaby,ffwxax4,t3_evn2cb,1580313115.0,"Hahah my husband keeps on saying this :') Especially when we babysit for family and friends. To be fair, it does make me appreciate sleeping in a lot!"
loseit,ffwm18z,t1_ffvsmko,1580305161.0,Hahah I always have this problem! My second toe is actually a little bit longer than my big toe and it leads to so many shoe mishaps. Basically my shoes are always a size bigger than they need to be because of that stupid toe.
fatlogic,ffwlqyq,t1_ffwi0zr,1580304926.0,"Hahah so jealous. I'm the same height as you and 140 lbs now again (ugh too much chocolate) and it does *not* look good on me. I'm slim built and grow muscle verrrry slowly, so literally all my excess weight is fat and it's all in my stomach. I look fine with clothes on, but I'm really turned off by my stomach when undressed. So I wanna lose 10 lbs again..."
relationships,ffwlgja,t3_evcfsr,1580304692.0,"So this is an easy one.

She is marrying you, not her parents.

So she should wear the ring you got her, not her parents. 

If they don't like it, they should ask her to marry them themselves.

I mean honestly what the hell? Besides the fact that any marriage tradition is basically outdated and probably discriminatory stuff, isn't the whole idea that the *son* takes the family's heirloom ('the Ring') and asks his girlfriend to wear it to show they've become part of the family?

Why does she, as someone who is already part of this family, need to wear a ring from this family *as an engagement ring*? This makes *no sense at all.* She can obviously wear a family heirloom to show she's part of the family. But the engagement doesn't change anything for *her* family status, so there is literally no reason whatsoever *she* needs to be wearing *her family's* engagement ring.

Wat would make sense, is that *you* start wearing this ring. That'd show her parents."
fatlogic,ffwkzt8,t3_evhr69,1580304313.0,Ugh god this keeps pissing me off. I'm a woman of average size (in my country) and I have a fricking' sedentary job. 1600 kcal is my maintenance. It does *not* make me tired or cold or uninterested in sex. It keeps me this weight and this active.
Showerthoughts,ffwkvam,t1_ffwjrbt,1580304210.0,"Yas. Which is strongly correlated to the welfare level, which is correlated to not needing kids as an investment."
writing,ffwkm3g,t1_ffwdp2d,1580303996.0,"Teacher here too and I can't really write on days I teach classes. I've resigned myself to the weekends and holidays, like you! I finished a manuscript last autumn and I wrote most of it in the previous two summer holidays. 

Teaching (and many other jobs, probably) just take up so much mental energy that my brain needs to unwind at night. I do enjoy reading at night though; it feels like it's helpful for writing in a passive way, without using up energy."
writing,ffwke1j,t3_evkusq,1580303807.0,"For me personally it really is a matter of sticking with it for X amount of time. I have to push through the urges for procrastination (I should get another drink... I should check reddit another time... I should play that game on my phone..) and once I've spent a little time with the characters, the scene comes alive for me and the story draws me in. 

How long that takes, differs every time. I'ts probably somewhere between 5-30 minutes or even longer if I'm really distracted. I've noticed that if I force myself to write at least 50 words, usually by then I'm *in* the story and I'll continue. 

It also helps a lot if I'm in a context where I can't do much else, like a *really* boring training course or meeting something \*grin\* I used to write a lot during boring classes in college, but as an adult, the only boring classes I'm in are the ones I teach :P So I try to make my own environment at home as boring as possible."
Showerthoughts,ffwe9qr,t1_ffwciog,1580297638.0,"Hahah it's always baffling to me that so many men (and probably women too?) don't seem to notice? I personally don't wear much makeup (just mascara, usually, since I've got see-through lashes). But I find it *so* noticable if someone is wearing foundation, 'natural' eyeshadow/eyeliner, 'natural' lipstick, etc. However obviously I've got more of an eye for it since I've put it on myself at one point or another in the past."
AskEurope,ffwbpfd,t1_ffw6dnr,1580294242.0,"I don't know how they relate to other schools. We've got different levels of secondary school (focused on a future in menial jobs (vmbo) or more mental jobs (havo/vwo), preparing for trade school or university). Afaik in all types you'll usually get at least 3 hours of English a week on average, but I'm not sure about the lowest levels of trade school preparation. Might be they get 2 hours. 

At the higher levels, some years you get 4 hours a week, other years (or semesters) you get 2 or even 1 hour a week. So there's a variation, but on average you get quite a lot of English. 

I'm not sure about vmbo schools, but if you finish the havo you're supposed to be around B2 level in English, and if you finish vwo you're supposed to be around C1 (at least for reading/listening skills)."
AskEurope,ffwbj34,t1_ffwapnz,1580293994.0,I tell my students sometimes that I learned the word 'agony' through a particular scene in Cow and Chicken :')
badwomensanatomy,ffw3uxg,t1_ffw0yip,1580283155.0,"Yeah because the clitoris is a much bigger (and internal) organ than people previously thought. When I first read that, I was like 'oh that makes total sense from how I've been experiencing this' hahah.

However it fortunately still means (some) women can come from intercourse. With the right angle of the penis & the position, it can even be possible to stimulate the clitoris on the outside through just intercourse, without using hands or other attributes. Which would definitely be a clitoral orgasm - but unlike this person in the image said, still an orgasm through intercourse."
suggestmeabook,ffw3hgr,t1_ffuukos,1580282698.0,"Ooh, off to join the sub. I third this suggestion; I loved this series as a teenager and I think they still hold up well as an adult.

Fun way to enjoy them more: try to figure out the details that reference actual historic happenings in the UK :) think anecdotes around Alfred the Great, for instance."
suggestmeabook,ffw3f37,t1_ffv0wa6,1580282616.0,"Hahah I did the same, like 'screw those Live ships I just want to see what happens with Fitz', only to realise that while you might not need LST to understand Tawny Man, TM *will* spoil some parts o the LST for you."
namenerds,ffw31lg,t1_ffunplx,1580282162.0,"Actually in French (and many other languages) there's a distinctly different pronunciation between Adrienne and Adrien, and most other 'feminine' spellings. They have a feminine pronunciation, too."

It's really funny to see my friend in Spain like 'yeah no the kids just sort of go to bed by themselves here' and all of our Dutch friends with kids go like ""O\_o what do you mean you don't need an hour long ritual before bed every day at the exact same time""."
AskEurope,fftkjeo,t1_fftdnq8,1580222938.0,I was so confused when my MIL invited us over for 'tea' the first couple of times :') Like ok yes I like your tea oh hey we're eating here as well?
