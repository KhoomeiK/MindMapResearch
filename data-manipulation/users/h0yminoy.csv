Everyone receives an education to a certain point for free (hopefully enough to form intelligent and cohesive thoughts) Continuing education is on you. The quality of education would drop significantly if it was free for everyone. Same with healthcare. We pay for healthcare too but there is a higher standard of care. Alot of people with cancer in Canada actually come to the USA for treatment because our healthcare is so much better. The same would happen with education.
