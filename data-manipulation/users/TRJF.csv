If this gets to the point where there is a charge and you do get a lawyer to contest/mitigate them, ask that lawyer if he or she thinks the prosecution has a *corpus delecti* problem.  In general, a conviction cannot be based *entirely* on a confession without any corroborating evidence - if you walk into a police station and say ""I robbed a guy,"" for instance, they can't ~~charge~~convict you with robbery unless they can get some piece of evidence related - the guy you robbed, or money you stole, or something showing you were involved in a scuffle where and when you said you were, or something.  I could see a zealous prosecutor saying ""being around other teens with a non-zero BAC is enough,"" but if I was making the prosecuting decision and a defense attorney brought up the corpus issue, I would probably dismiss the charge."

Now, some people say your long run should be moderately faster/more challenging than easy pace, but that's going to depend on how you're training and what you're training for.

LifeProTips,ff4gmpj,t1_ff4fyu5,1579563136.0,"Here's the two big problems with riding a bike against traffic:  
  
1. (Less important reason) Other vehicles treat you as a vehicle, not as a pedestrian - they are expecting you to go with them (like the law usually says you should).  
  
2. (More important reason) You're riding 10mph and get hit by a car going 30mph.  If you're riding with traffic, net impact is 20mph and you go over the handlebars and skid.  If you're riding against traffic, net impact is 40mph and you go straight into the windshield.  One hurts, the other is fatal.

loseit,ff4b0en,t3_erkou6,1579559425.0,"Right off the bat you've got a disconnect: your title says *fastest* way to lose weight and your post asks for the *best* way to lose weight.  The fastest way is not the best way.  The best way is to make small, sustainable changes to your diet, bringing your daily calories to a moderate deficit (this is necessary), while also incorporating some healthy movement into your life (this is not necessary but is ideal).   
  
Biking, running, and going to the gym are not going to be the best ways to lose weight.  They can help and they can be a *part* of an overall health-focused weight loss program, but the real way to do it is by taking control of your diet - exercise should be your #2 proority.  Another thing to consider: none of those is inherently better than any other - the best exercise is exercise you *enjoy* and will *stick with.*
  
What you should do now is:  
1. Start counting the calories you eat.  
2. Determine how many calories you burn in a day (look up ""TDEE calculator"" online for a good estimate).  
3. Make small dietary changes to bring your daily caloric intake below your TDEE.  
4. Start exercising *lightly*, maybe 3 times a week (NOT every day - the easiest way to screw up is to try to do too much too fast, and you **will** burn yourself out or get hurt), and slowly - over the course of weeks and months - increase frequency and intensity."

Honestly? Yes. Weight loss became easier after I weaned myself off of Zoloft.  But, if I'm being absolutely honest, there is a non-negligible chance I wouldn't be here without Zoloft.  I was on for 10 years or so before I got to a place in my life where I could try going without, and it did make weight loss easier.  I know it feels like it's holding you back in that regard.  If your doctor says it's ok, it may be appropriate to try a reduction with an eye towards slowly putting it aside - but please, please, be honest with yourself about what it's doing for you, and if you start to fall back into old ways of thinking then consider putting off the change for a bit."

It's sounds to me from your post, though, like you know this as well, and would like to get back to a healthy intake but are struggling to do so.  If I'm understanding you correctly, you're not sure whether the reason for you eating so little is 1) because your body doesn't want you to eat more vs. 2) your mind doesn't want you to eat more; you ""feel"" like it's #1 but you have a sneaking suspicion it's really #2.  
  
I was thinking of a bunch of schemes to determine whether it's #1 or #2, but realized it would all be nonsensical advice that I'm not qualified to give.  Long and short of it is this: if you can't bring yourself to eat more than 1000 calories a day, you need to talk to either a doctor or a therapist, or both.  The order is up to you.

1.  Stop running **now**.  Bad shin splints can put you out of commission for **months**.  I tried to run through shin splints once, and it took almost a whole year to get back to normal.  It was so bad I could not walk.  I cannot stress this enough - if you keep running a mile a day this will **not end well.**
  
2.  REST until you are PAIN FREE.  
  
3.  Start jogging or doing some exercise again, **not every day**, with at least one day of rest after each session with anything other than minimal impact.    
  
My two favorite subs are r/loseit and r/running, and I occasionally give advice on both.  If you had a BMI *under 25* and were just starting to run, I would strongly recommend you run 3 days a week, maybe 4 days at most.  That goes doubly for someone overweight - it should be at least a couple of months before you run back-to-back days.  It does not matter how far your muscles or lungs or brain feels like you can run - your **bones and tendons** are not ready to run every day, or 6 days a week, or 5 days a week.
  
I say this all from a place of love, and of severe personal pain.  Through my 20s, I bounced between 250 and 280.  I tried to get fit and healthy four times, and I failed four times because I tried to do too much too fast, got hurt, got discouraged, and fell off the wagon.  Finally, at age 28, I decided to take it slow, so slow, far far slower than it felt like I should be taking it.  In a year, I lost 85 lbs (down to 175 now) and went from not being able to jog 2 minutes in a row to going out and running 10 to 13 miles every saturday, 35 miles a week in total.  BY FAR the easiest way to fail is to do too much too fast.  But in 2 years when you're picking your new goal weight in the 180s and getting ready to run your first half marathon (or whatever else you want to do), you're going to thank yourself for taking it slow and staying injury free."
philosophy,feazfsq,t1_feashu8,1578953853.0,"Absolutely.  Most defense attorneys I know - and every public defender - consider it a sacred moral duty to hold the government, with its enormous police power and investigative/punitive apparatus, to the absolute highest standard possible.  As a prosecutor, I agree with them, and similarly demand that the government I am a part of be forced to ensure guilt as best we can before exercising the power to remove money, freedom, and - occasionally - life from individual citizens.  It's an imperfect system with false convictions and false acquittals, but it's one of those ""it's the worst system except for every other system"" type deals.

running,fdtfabh,t1_fdtd94y,1578715931.0,"I replied to something above, but I'll reply to this too.  The usual rule is 100 calories per mile - so, if your goal is 500 calories burned, run 5 miles.  For most people this will probably slightly underestimate your calories burned, which is a good thing if weight loss is part of your goals.
  
I've also seen a slightly more refined version of this rule, which takes into account body weight - 75 calories per mile per 100 lbs.  So, if you weigh, say, 160 lbs, you're probably burning closer to 160*.75=120 calories per mile.  So, you'd need to run 4.16 miles to burn the 500 calories.  
  
Personally, I'd just go 100 calories per mile (unless you're, say, under 120 lbs or over 200 lbs) because it's easier to remember and you don't need to adjust it if your weight changes."

Because ""lightly active"" and the other categories are pretty subjective, your best estimate will be to select the ""sedentary"" option - which will give you an estimate of the calories your body will burn in a day from just sitting around, standing up, walking a normal amount - and then manually adding in your exercise calories like the poster above said.  
  
For example: I'm a 5'11"" male, 30yo, 175 lbs.

Increase your mileage, and run most of those miles wayyyyy more slowly than 7 minutes.  Most of your runs should be long and slow, not HIIT.  Basically, follow the Order of Operations (check the sidebar) to slowly build up to where you can run a few miles in a row without stopping (no matter what the pace - honestly, at the start, slower is better).  Then, slowly increase your mileage, and the pace will follow, because your general aerobic ability will increase.  
  
I started from *true* sedentary, and I never really speed-trained.  At the start, I couldn't run a mile without stopping at any pace, but I worked a few months until I could run about an 11:30 mile.  Then, over the course of maybe 6 or 8 months I went from 4 miles a week to 6 to 8 to 12 to 15 to 20 or more, all between 10 to 11:30 minutes per mile.  At that point, I decided to test my mile time, just to see.  Figured maybe I could run an 8:30 or so.  I came in at 7:15, and when I made an effort to pace myself better later that month it was a 6:40.  Basically, I got my mile time under 7 without even trying to do so - my gains were 100% from just building my general aerobic base (and losing a lot of weight while doing so), no speed training, intervals, HIIT, or anything like that involved.

Definitely google Couch to 5k and check out some of those programs.  They're designed to keep you uninjured while building up an aerobic base.  You can tailor things to your liking, but a C25K is going to have the appropriate amount of work and rest to balance gains and injury prevention.

3. A *large* percentage of your mileage should be run at a *far* slower pace than your maximum.   
  
Look into a Couch to 5k program.  Something like that will get you set up well.
  
Basically, if you're just starting to get into running, can run an 8 minute mile, and want to get that down to 6 minutes or lower, you should start out by running 3 or at most 4 times a week, a few miles each time, with most of those miles somewhere between a 10 and 12 minute pace (however easy enough it needs to be that you can carry on a conversation).

loseit,fcryhvn,t1_fcrr975,1577908382.0,"200 is definitely doable - it's challenging but can be done healthily - and I particularly like that you're thinking about checkpoints and such.  I'm a 5'11"" guy who went from 255 to 175 in exactly one year.  I didn't set a final goal, rather, I said ""let's get under 250, however long that takes,"" then ""let's get under 240, however long that takes,"" and so on.  May favorite way to think about it is ""I'm not trying to lose 50lbs (or whatever), I'm trying learn habits and processes to lose 5lbs, then repeat that process to lose 5lbs again, and again, 10 (or however many) times.""  
  
Based on my personal experience (multiple failed attempts in my early-to-mid 20s before success in my late 20s), I have two pieces of advice:  
  
1. Consider setting that calorie amount higher.  Instead of going right to 1800, start with, say 2500 or even 2800 (you should still lose weight at that level given your stats).  Each week, make one *small* change to reduce your daily calorie intake by 50 or 100 calories.  For instance, I ate a sandwich every day.  One week, I switched from white bread to whole grain.  The next week, I switched from mayo to salt and pepper.  The next week, I switched from bacon to lots of peppers.  And so on.  Consider gradually working down to 1800 (which is about where I ended up, by the way), rather than just starting there - I found this more sustainable.  
  
2. Try hard to not worry too much about the timeline.  The point of all of this is to form habits that will last the rest of your life.  It's really easy to see ""I'm not on schedule to lose x pounds by y date,"" and to get discouraged.  Remember this: in 5 years, when you're running half marathons and in the best shape of your life, you're not going to care whether it took 6 months, 12 months, or 24 months to get you there.  All of that is nothing compared to the rest of your life!  
  
For most people, but *especially* for guys in their 20s, I've found, the easiest and most common way to screw up is to try to do too much too fast, get hurt and discouraged, get depressed, and fall off the wagon.  Based on what you're saying, I'm really confident you're going about this the right way - just remember to keep it slow, that it's a marathon and not a sprint, and you'll be joining me down in the 100s before too long!"
loseit,fcqpdx6,t1_fcq9e7d,1577890016.0,"Just be aware that 50kg puts you very close to the border of an underweight BMI (just going from 50 to 49, say, would put you there).  That cut-off isn't some magic line, and it's going to be different for every person; 50kg may not be unhealthy for you, but it very well may be.  It's definitely at the point where, without knowing anything more about you, I'd be concerned that health was possibly being sacrificed for weight loss.
  
An unsolicited observation/suggestion: a lot of people think ""I won't feel good/healthy or look good/healthy until I get to X weight,"" but they never consider that, at a certain point, a little toning and muscle goes much farther in terms of health/aesthetics than weight loss.  The poster above is absolutely correct.  
  
I don't know from your post if you're really trying to do anything in that regard, but I would suggest that, instead of just gunning for 50kg, maybe at some point soon (now would be great, but you can wait until you hit the 54-to-56kg range if you choose) take a couple of months and focus on keeping your weight the same, but doing some light lifting/yoga/stretching/bodyweight exercise/building just a bit of muscle tone.  Doing that will make you look/feel better than just losing a few more kg, and will definitely be *at least* as healthy as losing a few more kg.  Even 15 minutes of bodyweight exercise done before leaving your bedroom for the day can go a long way over the course of months."

running,fcnm2j2,t1_fcn98b7,1577814082.0,"Im right there with you, in the 23s for 5k time.  The very rough estimate I usually see is that a good 10k goal is twice your 5k plus two minutes.  Playing around with some pace calculators online and taking their averages, the slightly more precise formula I get is: double your 5k time, then add 4.5 seconds for each minute of your 5k time.  That gives the following correspondences: 16 minute 5k -> 33:12 10k; 20m 5k -> 41:30 10k; 24m 5k -> 49:50 10k, 30m 5k -> 1:02:15 10k.  Not perfect but it seems to be a solid estimate within a few seconds of what various calculators are spitting out.
  
Long story short, if you can get a 24 minute 5k, a 50 minute 10k is probably the *perfect* goal for you!  I've never raced a 10k, but I may very well as part of half/full training this year (I've never run those either!), and sub-50 is exactly what I'll be gunning for as an A-goal. Definitely, you'd need to run more miles per week training for a 10k than a 5k, but if your favorite distance is a half, you should be able to do so!  If you're anything like me, the main difficulty might be mental - the thought that ""a 10k is twice a 5k, so how can I run it at *almost* 5k speed?""  I've just got to remember to trust my training and my body and all those miles I put in!"

running,fcjecxf,t1_fcj9yh8,1577684615.0,"I would not go from 2 per week to 6 per week.  The advice I usually see is to get used to running X days a week for a couple of months, at least, before running another day, building up mileage very slowly over many weeks.  The goal is to be sure you're acclimated to increased stress before increasing it further - and running involves unique stresses that are not present in other forms of cardio.
  
Essentially, the easiest way to injure yourself is by doing too much too fast - and we're not always very good at telling what is ""too much.""  If you're running a 1:33 on two days a week, you necessarily have a great deal of natural talent, and you're probably in very good shape.  Believe it or not, that puts you at risk in a subtle way: it's quite possible that, when you start running a lot, your lungs and muscles will be 100% ready to take you as far and as fast as you desire, but your bones and tendons and ligaments *may not* be ready.  Unlike an inability to breathe, which will be a limiting factor, the first sign that your bones/tendons weren't ready for the increased stress could very well be something snapping or cracking or popping.  
  
You're probably going to be able to progress faster than most, but there's very little downside to erring on the side of caution and building up slowly.  It might feel frustrating at times, but in a year or two when you're running 6 times a week and cranking out hundreds of miles each month, and getting ready to *place* at a half-marathon, you're not really going to care about whether it took you 6 days or 6 months to get to that point - you'll only care that you got there injury-free."
loseit,fcjdb21,t1_fciix5i,1577683676.0,"So, here are the basic concepts:  
  
1. Your body is constantly burning fuel - how much fuel it uses depends on a number of factors.  The amount of fuel is measured in calories.
  
2. Your body's constantly burning calories because it's constantly doing stuff - pumping blood, breathing, thinking... those things take calories.  Even if you laid in bed for a whole day and didn't move an inch, your body would still burn calories.  This is your BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) - the amount of calories your body uses to *just exist and not move*.  For me, a 30-year-old, 5'11"" male who weighs 175 lbs, my BMR is about 1700 calories a day.  Someone else's could be significantly higher or lower depending on any of those factors.  
  
3. We don't usually lie in bed all day, though; we usually move and do things.  That's why the most important number is TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure).  That is the total amount of calories you burn in a day - basically, your BMR (the fuel you use just to exist) plus the fuel you use to move around.  If I have a pretty slow day, don't do any exercise, just walk around a normal amount, sit down some, stand up some, just that movement alone is going to give me a TDEE of about 2100 calories.  My body has used 1700 calories just to exist, and then used another 400 to move.  Now, some days, I run 15 miles and burn 1800 calories doing that.  On those days, my TDEE is almost 4000.  
  
4.  Here's the CICO part: let's say I go for a 15 mile run and burn 4000 calories.  If I eat 4000 calories that day, I will have given myself precisely enough food to balance out my fuel needs.  I won't gain weight or lose weight.  
  
5. But what happens if I only eat 2000 calories that day, when I've burned 4000?  Where does that needed fuel come from, when I haven't given it to my body in the form of food? Answer: *it comes from fat*, which the body breaks down.  Fat is how the body stores excess calories, and when you use more fuel than you take in, your body gets it from the fat it's stored.  That fat is broken down in the process, which is why we lose weight.
  
6.  Conversely, if I ate *6000* calories that day, my body would only need to use 4000 of them.  Where would the other 2000 go? My body would *create* fat - I would *gain* weight, because my body would be storing those calories for later the only way it knows how (by making my belly a bit bigger).  
  
7. So, that's why we compare Calories In to Calories Out (CICO).  If the CI is bigger than the CO, your body will store extra fat.  If the CO is bigger than the CI, your body will make up for it by burning fat, and you will lose weight.  
  
8. How much weight will you gain or lose?  Turns out, there's a very good formula for that - a pound corresponds to about 3500 calories.  If, over the course of a week, say, you take in 3500 more calories than you expend, you'll gain a pound.  If you take in 3500 fewer than you expend, you'll lose a pound.
  
**SO**, to answer your questions, not in the order you asked them:  
  
2. You don't need to do exercise to do CICO, because your body is burning calories even when you don't exercise.  If your average TDEE for a week is 1800, just from walking around without any exercise, you'll lose weight if you eat less than 1800 calories per day, on average.  
1. Let's say on a normal day with no exercise you eat 1450 calories and burn 1800.  Your *calorie deficit* (calories out minus calories in) is 350, so you'll lose about .1 lbs that day.  The next day, you still eat 1450 calories, but exercise and burn 350 calories, bringing your total expenditure that day to 1800+350=2150.  On that day, your deficit is 700, so you'll lose about .2 lbs.  
3. IF can work well with CICO, but it's not necessary.  That's sort of the best thing about thinking about weight loss in CICO terms - it doesnt matter if you have one 1800 calorie meal, or eighteen 100 calorie snacks.  If you eat X calories in a day, and burn more than X calories in a day, you will lose weight.  If IF works for you, then that's a perfectly good way to go about it."

I don't know Monroe County's procedure.  So, if you look it up and don't find any prelim scheduled yet, that doesn't necessarily mean one won't be in the coming weeks or months - it's just possible the police didnt get around to filing yet."

It's very unlikely that is the norm for them, though - the much more likely reality is that the way they eat socially, four times a week, is very different from how they eat (or don't eat) the other 80% of mealtimes.  It's quite possible the 7000 calories you watched them eat over four meals is half of the calories they'll consume for the week.

running,fc31v3y,t3_efxgzt,1577379531.0,"I want to respond here on a couple of levels, as someone who has lost a lot of weight running.  
  
1.  There is exactly one way to lose 15 lbs in the next 35 days, and that's to burn approximately 52,500 more calories than you consume over that time.  That's a 1,500 calorie-per-day deficit.  That is unlikely to be healthy - the general wisdom is keep weight loss to 1% of your body weight per week.  If you're 200 lbs you can probably get away with it, but it would not be sustainable or ideal.  If you're much less than that it's just a flat-out bad idea.  
  
2. It doesnt matter when you eat your calories, whether it's entirely before your run, entirely after, or anything else.  The timing is irrelevant for weight loss purposes - it's just the total number of calories you consume over a week vs the number you burn.  What I'm getting at is that ""not eating after a run"" is a pretty meaningless concept - the entire rest of your life is ""after your run.""  
  
3. That being said, intentionally fasting after longer runs like that can be detrimental in two ways.  First, it can definitely hinder recovery.  You should be getting lots of protein to help muscle recovery and such, enough carbs to refuel for the next run, whenever that may be, and general vitamins and nutrients to keep everything working.  All of these absolutely vital things are going to be much harder if you're on a large deficit.  Second, fasting like that can *seriously* increase your hunger and make bingeing - or even snacking or smaller forms of cheating - far more likely, which will harm your weight loss efforts in the long term.  I rarely eat breakfast - but if I go to bed without eating after a 10 miler, I very well might make the choice to stop at a donut shop and consume 1000+ calories the next morning (a breakfast sandwich, donut, and coffee with cream can easily be that much - and, boom, that's half the calories for the day down the drain). 
  
4. Ultimately, running can be part of weight loss, but it should not be the primary part of it - that should be diet.  This is *especially* true if you are not an experienced runner - **do not** jump into 6 to 10 mile runs if you haven't been running at least a few miles multiple times a week for a few months.  A 10 mile run is going to burn, at the very most, 1500 calories, and likely less than that.  Exercise can be a meaningful part of weight loss, but trying to rely on running as part of a crash diet is a recipe for injury and health issues.  
  
I know a lot of this was unsolicited advice, and I hope I'm not coming across as rude.  But I'd suggest trying to run as part of a broader lifestyle change to eat and be healthier, making sure to eat for a purpose - to keep yourself healthy and fuel your body for its movement needs, be they running or just existing - and, if at all possible, aim for a slower, more sustainable rate of loss founded primarily on minor dietary changes and incorporating running as one part of the whole picture."

I didn't eat 25,000 calories over my TDEE yesterday.  I ate a lot of bread and pie and beer when I hadn't been eating that stuff, so my body's just gonna hold onto all those carbs and water for a few days before it gets rid of it.
