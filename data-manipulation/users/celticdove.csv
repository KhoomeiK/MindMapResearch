assholedesign,ffqbxtv,t1_ffq1q0d,1580129747.0,That's my mortgage payment plus two car payments. The CA rent struggle is real.
assholedesign,ffq6o4j,t1_ffq5jvd,1580123377.0,"I deal with some creditors who insist on pulling money directly from my bank. I don't like this at all. I don't want my main bank numbers floating around cyberspace and someone could make a mistake like pulling twice in one month or including an extra zero. 

I have a bank account just for these jokers and I only transfer what is needed to that account. It doesn't have overdraft protection.  If someone pulls to much in error, it will cost me $35 in overdraft rather than everything in my main account where I pay the rest of my bills and have some savings."
aww,ffp47rk,t3_eu4ta0,1580085825.0,You might have a long-haired domestic cat when....
LifeProTips,ffnow6b,t1_ffjd1j5,1580068729.0,Right. They are great when frozen plain. Mushy when thawed.
funny,ffgxpk0,t1_ffguq2p,1579917743.0,Lol. I thought he'd better smoke it before anyone else came along.
aww,ffgtd6i,t3_etc49g,1579914558.0,I heard circus music in my head as soon as pupper mounted the ball
LifeProTips,ffgspdk,t1_fffwebf,1579914075.0,"This is how I  learned that salespeople were assigned based on origin of last name. Me, a white girl, got so many sales calls from folks of my husband's country of origin. 

If someone called and didn't pronounce my name correctly,  I knew it was a sales call. If someone pronounced my name correctly and I didn't recognize the voice,  I knew that was also a sales call. I've since changed my name via second marriage and no longer answer my phone if I don't know the number.  Problem solved."
LifeProTips,ffgrd1m,t1_ffgk76q,1579913104.0,"That's perfect, bro. Count yourself lucky. Googling my name led to a porn star."
LifeProTips,ffgqr0f,t1_fffrhqw,1579912664.0,"Hopefully a tree never falls on his head. My son's name is Neil. During middle school  soccer games, everyone would yell his name when someone got hurt.  The first time really confused the little guy."
LifeProTips,ffgpunf,t1_ffgg7kl,1579912016.0,Right. When did we corrupt Dick to mean penis?  I know some Silent Generation Dicks but no Gen X Dicks
crochet,ff54zoe,t3_erfcwi,1579580395.0,Lovely! I made some Aussie wildlife pouches in this stitch. So much easier than single crochet when you need a closed stitch.
