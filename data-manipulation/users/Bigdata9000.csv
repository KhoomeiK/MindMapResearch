todayilearned,fd5bd3x,t1_fd56q6x,1578175967.0,"Good fires ignite the dry dead trees, and detritus in undergrowth, but are not severe enough to ignite the mature, moist, healthy trees. This has a renewal effect on the ecosystem, and some species have even evolved that heat as a catalyst for their seeds to sprout.

Bad fires are so hot from the exessive detritus and deadwood that they dry out and burn even otherwise healthy trees. This inferno is not something that naturally happens often. The excess fuel would have been consumed by good fires. 

We humans like our houses and possessions, so we stopped those good fires from happening, that builds up the fuels for a catastrophic fire.

Climate change is also not helping. Some areas are experiencing high rainfall, and some less rainfall than their ecosystems have evolved for. When plants are stressed by lack of moisture, they withdraw their moisture to their roots, and sacrifice appendages, making dry trees that would burn easier. The areas you hear about with devasating fires have the perfect storm of much higher than average fuel, and much lower than average moisture, like the Australian Tropical forests right now."
