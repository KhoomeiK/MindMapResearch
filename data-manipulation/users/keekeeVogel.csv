ScienceParents,ffdt46k,t1_ffdphcv,1579828257.0,"No wonder your name is â€œlifeâ€™s a game.â€ 

Her baby wasnâ€™t carrying anything. She assumed the hospital would not put her baby in contact with unvaccinated children considering what they knew. And shame on you for insinuating my friendâ€™s baby is to blame or her. Jesus Christ.

And a premature baby out and about?. Thatâ€™s the life of a premie! She took her in for one visit and she was gone hours later."
ScienceParents,ffds7od,t1_ffa9nsl,1579827618.0,Well said.
ScienceParents,ffdoxhj,t1_ffdmmb1,1579825517.0,Because she was a premature baby and had to take her to the hospital. She was too young and weak to be vaccinated. I guess she foolishly assumed others vaccinated their children. And that the people in care of her baby washed their hands after handling others.

ScienceParents,ffawi6v,t1_ffalo8x,1579746114.0,That was kinda my point. How sad a child died from the mumps because of her weakness and tiny body when it would have been so easily prevented. But I do appreciate your comment.
ScienceParents,ffaflv9,t1_ffaeooj,1579734601.0,Couldnâ€™t agree more. Itâ€™s been 4 years and I watch my friend struggle every day because someone did not vaccinate their child and brought them out. Donâ€™t vaccinate? Donâ€™t bring your kids out in public. Or your own ass for that matter as you said they could be carrying. My sisters neighborâ€™s child died from the whooping cough (pertussis) Now when have we had to worry about the whooping cough? Vaccinate your family or live in a bunker.
holdmycosmo,ffabone,t3_esid1g,1579731765.0,"â€œSarah, are you ok?â€ Is all I can think of. I had to watch it ten times cuz itâ€™s just so bizarre! The way she says it with zero urgency. Like she stubbed her toe. She fell

ScienceParents,ffa8vn1,t3_eqvfb1,1579730156.0,Absolutely fucking NOT. My friends baby that couldnâ€™t get all her vaccinations at her age died at 9 days because of the mumps. The mumps! Vaccinate your kids or leave them at home. I have zero patience for this anti-vac fad. These terminal diseases went away decades ago and now they are resurgent. She died all because someone didnâ€™t wash their hands after handling an anti-vac child before her.
cats,ff9gb3f,t3_ervc0f,1579712398.0,My friend lost his son tragically and his son loved cats.  I brought him over a rescue kitty and she has made such a difference in helping him cope each day. Now the texts I get are photos of her or telling me something funny or adorable sheâ€™s doing instead of texts about how he canâ€™t make it through the day. Animals are the best therapy there is!

(My cat was feral and terrified of going outside after we took him in) I fixed him the second I knew we were keeping him. That should be a law too. 

The shelter I got my dog from is huge. I mean huge. Like separate pavilions huge. They have a â€œred alertâ€ which means many of them are going to be euthanized tonight. My heart is breaking. Nothing I can do but encourage people to not buy and to fix your fucking animal so I donâ€™t have to see these desperate for just a chance faces I see. And they know. They smell it. They have to be dragged. They know. Itâ€™s the worst feeling Iâ€™ve ever felt. And I have accept it until people learn."

cats,fdo1cf8,t1_fdnwvzz,1578597073.0,"Yep. Could not agree more. When I find out someone breeds cats or dogs and just today rabbits ( which are euthanized just as often)  for money it makes me seethe. Iâ€™ve worked in shelters in 4 different parts of the country. Theyâ€™re always too much work after their adorable stage. I just donâ€™t get why you donâ€™t need an approved license to breed. When I lived in Orange County I met a girl that was trying to find someone that had a pit bull to breed hers for money. I was livid. Iâ€™ve seen more pit bulls that have stolen my heart than any other breed put down but there are just too many of them. Then people like this, â€œletâ€™s breed moreâ€

We did not become friends. 
My dog was bred and it pisses me off to know she was just a factory for someone to make some cash. Sheâ€™ll never have to know that again.

Also hereâ€™s my story about living in Orange County. I met a woman who said she just gave her first down payment for her dog. I said â€œthe shelters are over populated very badly.â€ She said â€œ Iâ€™m not taking a broken dog, Iâ€™m broken why would I want that?â€ 

Yeah we didnâ€™t become friends either. My dog came from a puppy mill. She spent her life in a cage being bred. For the rest of her life all she will know is warmth, kisses, treats, bed, play time and a family that absolutely adores her."
