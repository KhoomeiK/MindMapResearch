good news is that its one of the most researched viruses on the planet (since a quarter of the world has it) and new treatments and medicines are getting trialed all the time.  acyclovir is one of the more common meds they use to combat it, and recent research outta Shitcago has shown that by adding activated carbon to the med it was even MORE effective at controlling/reducing outbreaks.

one BIG thing to keep in mind, however, is as a SW you're a lot more susceptible to things like HIV when you have herpes (according to the CDC), so practicing safe sex becomes even more essential  :("

as to the feeling guilty part - why ?  its not uncommon for people to feel overloaded and want a little chemical-induced vacation from their own heads... ain't no different than someone hitting the bars and getting good and sloshed for a few hours.

guilt is a fairly useless emotion, really only there to say ""hey, this is your moral compass.  you done fucked up there...""  and you're like, ""yeah, thanks asshat - i figured that out about 60 seconds after i did it.  but make sure and remind me about it every day for the next 6 weeks so i get the message !""

so don't beat yourself up too bad.  you slipped.  it happens  :)  we learn SOO much more from our mistakes than we do from our successes.  as far as feeling joy, well - mebbe do what i do.  jack a few stupid comedies into your dvd (or spin up some on netflix) and have a good laugh at the idiotic antics of hollyweird.

or hit /r/puppies and see the grinning pooches.  never fails to bring me a little spark of joy !

hope you feel better soon, hun  :)  and ** hugz ** if you want 'em !"

sorry to hear about your grandma, i'm guessing you were close ?  but i'm also sure that she's proud of you and what you've accomplished thus far in school.  and she'll continue to brag on you and watch over you now that she's free of that old shell her soul was driving around for so many decades.  s'how it works, ya know...

sleep is a normal response to depression (amongst other things).  the body uses sleep as a general ""fix all"" for a lot of problems.  can't work on a engine while its running, after all !  during sleep, the mind spackles over cracks and puts the fade on bad memories, processing the good ones for later reuse and replay.  and a LOT of the biological systems kick into overdrive to repair the wear and tear that simply HAPPENS as we move through the world.

hope you feel better soon, hun !"

glad you see a therapist, tho - even if you're not getting all the help you need, you've still got a RL person to vent at.  i thought you meant seeing your psych Dr. once a year was a therapist...

in one of your replies, you mentioned hating your mom.  i'm sure you've heard this before too, but keeping hate in your heart (no matter how justified) hurts you more than it ever will them.  dislike them, avoid them, flip 'em off when you see 'em if it makes you happy - but don't dwell on hate.  its literally a poison...

i have a local friend who's a lot like you.  she's very negative because of her life situation right now  :(  even did a brief stint in a psych ward - which she INSISTS (now) did her more harm than good.  yet, when she was there, i know she was feeling better - whether it was due to the group therapy, med regimen she couldn't refuse, or just seeing other folks worse off than her, i cannot honestly say.

something you might wanna consider, because voluntarily checking yourself in usually means you can also voluntarily choose to check out  :)  and while you're there, they monitor all of the various hormone and chemical levels in your blood so they can make minute adjustments on dosages to help you back to a healthy state of mind... and give you a path to move forward with healing !

i'd really hate to think that you don't wanna stick around long enough to see your babies and grandbabies grow up  :)"

sounds like you've got Empty Nest syndrome times a million, which cannot be fun  :(  also sounds like a lot of your family are callous asshats.  sorry you've been so mistreated by everyone around you !

i get the empty life thing tho - if i didn't have work and active hobbies to occupy my time, i'd prolly go mad (well, MORE mad anyhow  ;p

as far as ""reporting people"" i don't think that works on reddit forums - things are too anonymous, for a reason.  you can get banned or blocked from a forum, but its just as easy to setup a new freemail and get back in again.  so i wouldn't worry overmuch about anyone calling the authorities on ya...

therapy once a quarter or once a year IS useless... most folks that need couseling have to go weekly in order to see improvement.  some need it even more often than that. 

are you able to take joy from ANYTHING ?  favorite shows, a good book, watching kids or puppies at play ?  seeing the better side of human nature ?  cuz i think mebbe you need to immerse yourself in good juju for a while, help you get back to center again  :)

in any case, i hope your today gets brighter than your yesterdays and you start to feel a lil' better about things !  ** hugz ** if you want 'em, my friend !"
SuicideWatch,fdlsiaq,t1_fdlr13m,1578531450.0,"seeing them visually is different than talking to them and letting their toxic BS seep into you and your life...

as far as your other friends, yes... you can.  especially if you explain to them WHY first.  you are not responsible for their safety, THEY are.  they can make the same decisions for themselves.  you're not their mom, and you can't protect everybody all the time.  its making mistakes and getting hurt that teaches us what to avoid in the future  ;)  

one of the HARDEST things for young people to really and truly understand in life is the idea that the ONLY person you can really control is you.  you aren't responsible for anyones actions but yours, and the illusion of control about anyone else is just that - an illusion.  we can't prevent things from happening, all we can do is choose how WE will respond to them when they do.

choose to protect yourself from this toxic person.  choose to find your center, get back into balance so you can deal with things later if a blow up occurs.  CHOOSE not to let their crap control you or what you do, or how you feel.  this is YOUR life, my friend.  and when the chips are down, you're only in charge of how you let others manipulate you.  

you can choose to get stepped on, or you can choose to avoid it and rise above the toxic drama they're throwing at you.  which sounds like a better option ?  ;)"
SuicideWatch,fdlrjfe,t3_elosq8,1578530790.0,"yeah, you definitely need to get him to reread the wedding vows  :(  ""in sickness and in health"" - thats a big, big point !

as to the angry, whiny part - i usually see that when people feel like they have no control over their life and whats going on around them.  if thats your case, you just need to stand up for yourself and take BACK the reins of your life.  don't let ANYONE tell you what you must do or have to do - this is your life and your path and you are as free to change direction and make your own decisions as any adult.

i DO hope you quit hating yourself, tho !  nothing good or useful comes from that - mebbe you need to give your brain a good talking to and straighten its ass out  ;p

SuicideWatch,fdlqvhc,t1_fdlq0e1,1578530335.0,"if thats the case, you just need to walk away from them for a while... get yourself back into a good state of mind, so you can deal with the blow up if and when it happens.

and if they're really your friend, they'll understand that.  there's absolutely nothing wrong with saying ""Look, i need a little break right now to get my head straight - the holidays have spun me for a loop and i've got to get some things in order.  I'll call you in a week or two and we can reconnect !""

don't take no for an answer, or accept excuses from them.  in this life, YOU have to prioritize YOUR well being  :)  that's not selfish or wrong, its just the way life works.  s'kinda like helping a person who's drowning - you've gotta keep yourself safe and THEN you can help them...

i hope you realize that other people don't, in fact, see you as worthless.  they prolly don't see you at all - not saying that to be mean, but the majority of folks are SO caught up in their own lives and dealing with their own problems that they really don't pay attention to the needs and wants of anyone who's not in their home.

SuicideWatch,fdhzrip,t3_elevnc,1578433145.0,"it's not bullshit... it's the benefit of age and wisdom that comes with learning how the world actually works, and not what TV and movies and storybooks say.

as you get older, you see a LOT more of the world than you ever imagined possible.  you start figuring out secrets and truths about how the world and society works.  and you figure out that relationships FAILING is the norm - its all about the numbers.

there are about 3.5 billion guys on this earth.  around a quarter of them are approximately your age.  thats 875 million.  there's around a thousand different personality types, quirks and combinations.  which means 875 thousand of 'em are somewhat like you, with common interests and goals  ;)  even if only one in a hundred of THOSE match what you're looking for, that's almost ten thousand potential mates with similar characteristics that'd make you a wonderful husband one day...those numbers don't really go down much for decades to come.

so i guess i just want you to understand that the whole ""one soul mate perfect love"" is just a dream cooked up by evil people to manipulate dreamers like yourself (and myself, long ago).

there are 10 thousand people out there, looking for a girl JUST like you.  some of them are asshats, some are really cool, some are real-life heroes and some are just normal folks.  why don't you stick around and meet some of them ?  cuz the one who's leaving doesn't sound like a very good match... and you've got a lifetime of adventure ahead of you  :)

you're 16, which IS legal in some states (i think i remember reading that somewhere on the 'web) but you're still FAR too young to be messing with someone pushing 40.  trust me  :)

grab hold of whats left of your childhood and enjoy it while you can.  the scary REAL WORLD is gonna be knocking on your door all too soon, so focus on YOU - becoming the person you want to be, building your life skills and developing work experience so you can survive and thrive out there.  romance and relationships and all that junk can wait until you've got your legs under you and are ready for one more level of difficulty and drama that a family seems to bring.

once you've terminated all contact and deleted the apps, mebbe back up your contacts and do a factory reset on the phone/tablet/whatever.  then feel free to talk to the people in your program, just exaggerate the dates a lil or be vague on when it occurred.
