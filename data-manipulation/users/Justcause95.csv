On top of all of this he's only seen his kids 5 times since September. HIS OWN KIDS. Can't see his youngest because the mom says ""I don't think he's old enough to deal with all of this"". It is scary that just because a man didn't push his kids out of his body, the mother just deciding no you can't see them is usually socially acceptable.
