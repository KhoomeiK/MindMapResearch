And you’re exactly right, the water metaphor I’ve heard before. So difficult to let go, though. 

My issues do stem from a loooot of stuff I went through in my childhood, as well as more recent experiences. In general a lot of people telling me I’m not good enough, and/or telling me what kind of person I ‘should’ be. So I’ve really internalized that idea. 

How would you describe re-parenting your inner child?"
selfimprovement,fcjx8b9,t1_fcjx1i4,1577709020.0,Sounds good! Thank you :) Writing things out always helps me so I’ll see if this is something I can add
selfimprovement,fcjthcr,t1_fcjmbzu,1577703891.0,"Exactly, the feeling of not being ‘enough’ for others has been an issue for a while with me. I just think it’s sad because I haven’t been myself for so long. And I feel a certain compassion towards myself for all that time. I honestly believed that my true self wasn’t good enough. 

Anyways, thank you for your kind words. It definitely helped :)"
selfimprovement,fcjt8cb,t1_fcji4ee,1577703523.0,"That’s so good to hear! That you figured out what caused it. I think with me it’s mostly the fear of people leaving me. I’ve had separation anxiety for as long as I can remember. I never made the link with control though. So I hope that knowing this will help me as it did you. I am in therapy so I’ll definitely bring this up there :) 
Thank you for your encouraging words!"
selfimprovement,fcjt4nm,t1_fcjdl3f,1577703373.0,"Oh wow I haven’t heard anything about that so far, I’ll check it out!"
selfimprovement,fcjt259,t1_fcjb5h8,1577703270.0,"I do see myself as at least having codependent traits if I’m not a codependent. The idea about a lack of power is exactly my issue. I’ve been reading about this lately to try and understand more. 
That sounds interesting! I’ll check it out :) thank you for your help"
selfimprovement,fcjsx96,t1_fcjaljj,1577703075.0,Thank you so much! I’ll check it out :)
selfimprovement,fcjswpm,t1_fciydhk,1577703053.0,"That’s an interesting approach, I really like that :) Thank you! I’ll try to ask that question more"
selfimprovement,fcjsuq3,t1_fcis9d8,1577702973.0,"Realization is often the first step :) But it’s nice to see that I’m not the only one. And no problem, I needed to get it off my chest so I’m glad people reading this are helped by my journey as well!"
selfimprovement,fcjsrj4,t1_fcinshd,1577702842.0,What you’re saying is so spot-on. I like your idea about exploring people more! And I agree control is about fear quite often :( I want to control that people don’t leave me. But of course I can’t control that. And that scares me. But it helps to see that other people can feel the same way and I think that your tips are really helpful! So thank you for that :)
selfimprovement,fcjse4u,t1_fcjlh9r,1577702293.0,I really like your explanation! I’ve had difficulty with comparing myself to my ‘perfect’ self all the time for as long as I can remember. I’ll work on looking at my progress instead. How did you do that?
selfimprovement,fcjsask,t1_fcihuex,1577702154.0,Yeah I completely agree! I just feel like I’ve been trying to be my perfect self for so long and I want to be able to let that go a bit. So balance indeed :)
LifeAfterNarcissism,fc5w035,t1_fc3jjtq,1577467080.0,"Oh wow that sounds insane :o I went through that same stuff. I always had to do everything exactly the way he wanted. But in my birthday, he didn’t even have a present. And the time that he did it was clear that he bought it because HE liked it. 

But I’m so glad to hear that you’re doing better as well! Hope that you’ll be able to enjoy holidays from now on as well :)"
LifeAfterNarcissism,fc3cyi5,t1_fc3c4ww,1577387043.0,Thank you so much! Merry Christmas to you too :) You’ve been through this as well?
oneanddone,fajswol,t1_fajs985,1576153803.0,Absolutely! I’ve always felt that two is the norm. So good to hear one is working out for you :)
