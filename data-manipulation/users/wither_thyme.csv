publix,ff7oa4j,t3_erz72s,1579654334.0,"I am currently a baker. I have nearly zero customer interaction since I mix in the very back of the bakery department. I really enjoy it. You would have to start out as a bakery clerk, which doesn’t require any experience. It is a lot more customer interaction though, but depending on how you do you could begin training as a decorator or baker relatively quickly (maybe a within a few months.)"
publix,ff7nh17,t1_ff7mhdw,1579653763.0,"I’m not great with customer service positions, so mixing is really enjoyable for me. I am further away from customers. Before the store opened I was trained in an empty store, everyone else (clerks, decorators) trained in stores that were already open. They didn’t have the new clerks work opening day because it can be overwhelming, so hopefully they do the same for you. Management encourages everyone to express interest in other areas and they like to cross train people :)"
publix,ff7lokg,t1_ff7h9vw,1579652524.0,I began working for Publix recently and opened a new store last year. I have prior bakery experience and was hired as a baker apprentice. One of my coworkers is a bakery clerk who has started learning mixing after only a couple months. Express interest in learning and hopefully once things settle down after the grand opening you can slowly learn new skills!

IWantOut,fdzdekh,t3_enbtz4,1578789159.0,"I have an Iranian friend (from Tehran) who was able to enter a Master’s program in Manitoba, Canada. This was in 2019. He had a couple professors accept him as a student and was thus able to get a student visa.  I’m not entirely sure how the process would be as you are not in University yet, but know that it is possible. It can be a lengthy and challenging process. My friend was lucky enough for his family to have enough money to help him leave.  I believe they needed to provide enough money to prove that he could support himself over in Canada: Through the university he was able to also get a living stipend. I hope you can find a way."

diabetes,fdf2ijb,t3_ekx0xz,1578351825.0,"As the SO of someone currently going through absolute hell due to complications of a surgery for advanced retinopathy, I’m relieved for you! So many of us take our eye sight for granted until something goes wrong. I’m glad that your eyes are okay :)"
