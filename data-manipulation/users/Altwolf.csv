EnoughTrumpSpam,ffcf7cy,t3_esr0tq,1579798162.0,"**Fact**: in 2014 fertilizer run-off from farms caused a toxic algae bloom in lake Erie. Residents of Toledo Ohio received an alert at 2 am not to drink their tap water or wash clothes it. Many did not see the alert until it was too late. Source: *Wired magazine; ""Arbor in the Court""; Jan 2020.*

**Fact**:Trump in 2020 strips protections from wetlands, streams, etc. ""handing a victory to farmers, fossil fuel producers and real estate developers who said Obama-era rules had shackled them with onerous and unnecessary burdens.""

Clearly, protection of Lakes, wetlands, streams, and thus PEOPLE, is of no concern when a corporation's ability to make more money is threatened.

I have talked to other LE about cold cases and they have always made clear how they would dearly LOVE to clear up their own still-open, cold cases.

The fact that the LE in this case is refusing to cooperate  makes it clear they are hiding something."

What was surprising to me is that, as I have always been told, each voice in an analog synth requires a duplicate circuit, but actually seeing how much space that requires was surprising. When people say ""circuit"" I imagine something tiny. But, for example, in the teardown of the JD-XA, there are two large circuit boards inside, one for the digital synth parts and one for the analog. The analog board has the same huge circuit repeated 4 times. The whole thing is like...big. Here's a picture. I am a bad judge of measurements.

Its easy to see now why so many Analog synths are monosynths or not multitimbral.

I had assumed that analog synth circuits were tiny these days or even wrapped up as little modules to be plugged into a board, but apparently not.

Actually, one of the synths that inspired me to write the post was the blofeld. Knowing that it uses a processor that is considered slow, seems to match up with my observations.
