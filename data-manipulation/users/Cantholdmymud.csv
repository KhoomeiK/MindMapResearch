KindVoice,ffgpo5k,t3_ethuti,1579911890.0,"Op -- your feelings are valid and on point. 

Establishing boundaries can be difficult, but something you dearly need to do at some time. 

I think you are on point and dealing with everything in the best way possible. If you want to chat, even if its about stupid shit (my speciality) or serious feelings, I'm down. 

I don't think this is a pity party, shit like this can really suck, it also can cloud your judgement and make it seem like it's impossible to get better, you got a lot of static going on right now but you will manage and you will find a way to tune that static out and into a channel that you want."
