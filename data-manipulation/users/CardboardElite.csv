Among other reasons, the realistic portrayal of what *being* a teen mom actually means (it's obviously really shit in a lot of ways), has been noted as one of the reasons why the show had such a strong effect.

This might sound crazy, but maybe, the advantages humans have by carrying little weight in muscle and being able to dissipate heat efficiently through sweat aren't very useful in a cold environment where you'd find wolves."
interestingasfuck,fettfew,t1_feto0pn,1579379863.0,"You're being downvoted but as usual, it's thanks to people's ignorance. Human's incredibly endurance is most noticeable in our ""original"" environment, the plains of Africa. Being bipedal, having the ability to carry water and being able to dissipate heat through sweat, we were able to out-last any animal while chasing them. 

For obvious reason, these distinct advantages don't hold up in fucking Canada and it's highly unlikely humans would be able to beat wolves in endurance."

There are examples of people [hunting Cheetahs](https://runblogger.com/2013/11/can-human-outrun-cheetah.html). They would run after them for over *four miles* in the blazing heat. Do you know many obese kids or adults that could run for 4 miles in the blazing African heat? 

So no, an out-of-shape human wouldn't be able to outrun a cheetah or barely any wild animal for that matter.

Edit: Cheetahs are even a sort of best-case scenario since their body is highly adapted for sprinting, and quite awful for long-distance running. A typical wolf, as comparison, will cover between 10 to 30 miles in a single day."

todayilearned,fe8xjk4,t1_fe8u0rp,1578932069.0,"This is a flawed explanation of the statistics behind it. A more intuitive way to think about it is to work backwards. What's the chance a flood does *not* occur in any given year? You'll agree it's 99% or 0.99. This means the chance of *no* flood in a 100 year window is 0.99^100, which gives is about 0.37 or 37%.

So the odds of a flood occuring once in a 100 year timeframe are 1.00-0.37=63, therefore 63%."
apexlegends,fe8reu2,t1_fe8aq4w,1578929685.0,"Disallowing smurfing is practically impossible and you named a bunch of the reasons why. I don't know any popular game that deals with smurfing really effectively, but some do better than others.

Basically, there are only a few things you can do:

**- High barrier to entry.** If the game costs $59,99 and you have to spend 20 hours grinding before you can play competitive, people will be less likely to buy a second copy just to smurf.

**- Make intentionally deranking difficult.** By having a good report system (Overwatch in CSGO, for example) combined with computer learning and other methods, make it very hard for someone to intentionally derank quickly on an existing account.

**- Make ranks and items feel special and rewarding.** This one will likely only make a marginal difference, but awesome skins and other cosmetic items and/or upgrades make people's main accounts much more personal and fun to use. And thus smurf accounts less enjoyable to use."

This isn't to say that poverty and lower education doesn't have adverse effects, as parents of **under**vaccinated children are more likely to be living in poverty. Under-vaccination, however, luckily isn't that big of a problem in the US (but could become one if access to healthcare decreases and poverty increases)."
