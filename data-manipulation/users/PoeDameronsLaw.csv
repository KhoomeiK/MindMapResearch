They're telling you that you can't have it both ways.

So either A, reject them as you would reject *any* woman and just say you are not interested, or B, reject them by saying it's because they're trans and you aren't comfortable with it, but just know that it is impossible to do B without also hurting their feelings.

Literally no one involved said you have to have sex with them if you don't want to. Using words like ""rape"" are extremely ignorant in this, beyond ignorant. It's just being pretty clearly explained to you that you can't both invalidate them as a woman as well as spare their feelings.

Traditionally, the bride's family pays for a good portion of the wedding. You're the bride's family, whether you have the relationship with her you think you should or not. You shouldn't be seeing her biological father as competition, you should be seeing everyone involved as still a parent to her. Your job as a step parent is to give the best of yourself, and that's all that you can do. Likely, you and her could stand to benefit tremendously from some family counseling. 

But when it comes to the wedding, this is *not* the area to start putting your foot down. You're escalating in something that is going to be one of the most important parts of her life. You're going to drive the wedge even further, and stick your poor wife in the middle of it, which she will resent you for. Rethink this."
