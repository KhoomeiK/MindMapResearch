getdisciplined,fe65sp7,t3_ent3xx,1578882432.0,"Do you have trouble finding the things you want to do, or doing the things you want to do?   


If its the first one, then id say either trying random things and see if you like them, or the hard approach. Where you for a day or a week dont allow yourself to go on youtube, or get entertained by anything. And I mean anything. Its a good way to figure yourself out.  


The last one however, is harder. I unfortunately do not have an answer other than just doing something in the moment. Using motivation to your advantage and boring yourself out. Like if you dont allow yourself youtube and such, then the only thing left to do is working out, making music, reading up on things. But I am still trying this method myself, so I dont know if it works or not \^\^"

There are plenty of good ones out there, that do respond and arent gonna stand you up after agreeing to begin with. Best of luck mate, I hope you find someone who is worth it"
