The Albert & Victora is the true 5 Star... Club 33 falls short, as it looks more like a ""Disney Park interpretation"" of a 5-star restaurant."

About a year ago I found the supplier who installed our granite and countertops before we bought our home.  I told her I wasn't a fan of not being able to see the dirt, and the consultant said ""thats the point, to not see dirt."". Ew."

We moved into our home 2yrs ago, and many of the existing blinds that were broken were from Blinds.com

To be honest, I'm  not sure if it's a quality issue or the other family was handling the products rough, but many of the strings and sticks to open and close the blinds were broken off."

CatAdvice,fdv6j3x,t3_emzgmm,1578743873.0," Like any senior, cats can what I can only describe as oily, as they age.  There are waterless shampoos for cats to help them ""stay fresh,"" make sure she allows you to.

Our cat passed at 14yo, and while on the younger side for a cat to pass, my husband and I looked for the following:


Does she still want to be around you, and interact with you?  

Does she play? (don't worry how long for, older cats tire easily)

Does she still enjoy looking out the window and watch for birdies?

Does she look happy?


Towards the end, our cat withdrew and just looked tired...  Not sleepy cat tired, but a mentally tired."

First,  if there are toxic people in your life, fvck them.  God gave you this gift of life, and if they can't see how wonderful you are that is their issue.  

God lead you to post this - you have not failed God - He is leading you right now.
Don't lose hope, in the darkest times remember God is there.   




Here are two subreddits that have helped me gain perspective on the toxic people in my life:


r/raisedbynarcissists
r/empaths

CatAdvice,fdonwpp,t1_fdohdvz,1578609003.0,"While having three cats does sound amazingly cute, I completely understand your concern about the financial aspect.

Not sure what the cost of the cat was, but if you don't get your deposit back, or worse the entire amount, the long term financial costs of three cats will be far greater than this.

Meh, I'm also not too fond of breeders collecting money prior to the babies being 8+wo and able to go home. The waitlist and deposit collecting sounds a bit irresponsible to me and more like pressure-sales tactic to me."

Once the time comes to expand her space, she will be able to come and go outside of the room (hopping over the gate) and she won't feel threatened.  We used this one and it was fantastic:  https://www.amazon.com/Munchkin-Easy-Close-Metal-Baby/dp/B07BM9P8SZ/ref=asc_df_B07BM9P8SZ/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=241998714674&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=9560471664179378449&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9051808&hvtargid=pla-467040235564&psc=1

As far as her breaking the habit of biting your hands, it takes an adult cat 4-6mo to accept new habits/environments.  Stay consistent, wand toys are great and only use your hands for pets and scritches.
She will understand soon.

Have you tried to tire her out with a long playtime before you went to bed?  As soon as I started to do that, our cat would be so exhausted she would sleep through the night instead of getting crazy cat zoomies at 3a"
CatAdvice,fddfy40,t3_ekrgdj,1578310534.0,"He's a kitten, so they have a lot more energy.  Your cats will tell him when they had enough...but it's good that your redirecting his behavior with playing with him as well!

Sounds like your doing great, kittens calm down around 1yo, but will settle down to adulthood at 3yo"
CatAdvice,fddf2z8,t3_ekosqi,1578309368.0,"First it's good the blood work came back  normal!

Our cat was like yours, very sensitive.  Is your room is her safe space, or have a room that she can claim as her own (no dogs or strangers)?  If not please make one, it sounds like your room - keep the door closed then a tall gate at the door at a later date (maybe never at this house).  Unlike dogs, cats simply need a place to feel safe, even if it's a bedroom just make sure there are windows so she can have access to visual stimulation during the day when you are at work.  While I don't doubt your dogs are sweet, she is attacking them and warning your brother because she feels threatened/stressed - she doesn't feel safe with full access to the house (and may never)...she just may be a very sensitive cat.

Get some feliway plug-ins (found at your local pet supplier) to put in your room - it gives off pheramones that say, ""this is a safe spot.""  Also ask your vet to see if anti-anxiety meds, like prozac, are an option for your cat until everything settles a bit.

You also say you have cat trees etc, which is wonderful, but because she is attacking you she also sounds like she is very bored.  How often do you play 1-on-1 with her?  Cats need interaction, even sensitive ones...maybe just sit with her in your room and use a laser pointer or wand, while cats like yours are very independent they still also need to interact with you - never ever use your hands though to play because she will learn that she can scratch and bite them.  While it's important to not use your hands to play, also never stare down your cat, that is a threat for them.  

You may still have a chance to save her from a rehome if you tweak some things.  You have an ultimatum because it sounds like your cat hasn't been managed enough, and the house has gone out of control. The way it's been working is not fair to your cat, you or your family. 

Cats are very smart and give fair warning prior to a true aggressive attack, it's so important to learn their language, there are plenty of YouTube videos online.  Jackson Galaxy is a wonderful cat behaviorist and his old shows are a great resource - I don't think you need to call him, just watch his videos.

While we all have made suggestions, you said that you are planning to travel in and out of the country to move, if all these changes are successful, what is the plan for your cat during these transitions (is there someone who is willing to care for her while you're traveling etc)"
