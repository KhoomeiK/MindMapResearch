trashy,fg7w7l7,t1_fg7swit,1580603037.0,"I’m in pretty much the exact same situation right now except my parents are Catholic.  The worst thing in the world is that they’ll force me to do what they want by threatening to basically ruin everything I like. They say they’re going to pull me out of soccer, often the only thing I’ve really enjoyed for 13 years, if I won’t take a break from an essay to make a giant list and minute by minute schedule to plan out my homework. They force me to waste my time. Whenever I get a single missing assignment I lose my phone and the laptop my school gives us, and don’t get them back for a week. As you might be able to imagine, the complete lack of any device makes it pretty difficult to do any homework online, which most of it is."
