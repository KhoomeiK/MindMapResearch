LinusTechTips,ffblbe5,t3_espcwm,1579770901.0,"I am still using the same rig I built from 2013 (with a newer SSD and PSU I added over the years) and it runs on a 4K monitor very well. Part of that is because I don't have too much money, but it's also because Linus actually gives some good consumer advice like buying parts that are too old is never a good idea or how you should buy in a way that will make upgrading much easier. Basically like how Linus says he only gets something if it's going to last a while. That stuck to me like glue and I always think about it whenever I buy something (PC related or not). There are tons of silly videos when it comes to builds. But, there's always a distinction when he gets real. Also, because of Scrapyard Wars, I always find myself at surplus sales searching for things with a good price. I got a 32GB PNY thumb drive that's older then my PC and I still use it to this day.

If Linus is worried his fanbase became mindless top-of-the-line buyers, at least speaking for me, it's the opposite. He helped me (and hopefully allot of people here) to be smart in what you buy."
