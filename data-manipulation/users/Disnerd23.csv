Hard to immerse myself in the atmosphere and enjoy my meal when a party of 30 a few tables down is letting their multiple kids scream every sentence, run around, and be annoying to all the surrounding guests.  

I would say go to Crystal Palace or any of the other buffet options for lunch or dinner. Not only are you getting your bang for your buck with really good food, but you’re also getting wonderful character dining experiences."
