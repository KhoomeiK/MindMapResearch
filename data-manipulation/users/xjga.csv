1. There's shaming going on for not complying with abuse done on yourself in some abuse cases
2. Must is relative. Some think promises are meant to be broken, some think promises are meant to be kept
3. People have different layers of approaches towards 'must' etc
4. We are discouraged from having free thought within countries. A fear tactic in some, a compliance tactic, a gaslighting tactic.

I would think that the person does not care enough for my wellbeing if he just indulges in something while ignoring the things that cause me stress. A bit of clutter is fine with me. Too much and it's overwhelming and affects my mental health. If you are fine with some clutter or chores not done it's fine.
