relationship_advice,feezi41,t1_feez4gk,1579044656.0,Ouch....didn’t even think of it like that but that definitely puts in a perspective I should’ve recognized. Thank you.
bulletjournal,feelpbx,t3_eoc8le,1579036293.0,I agree with your hubbie and dad. Very jetsons vibe
bulletjournal,feelixu,t3_eoou26,1579036188.0,This is a super creative Dutch door. I love it
bulletjournal,feelajb,t3_eof5qi,1579036054.0,This is painful and so beautiful at the same time
sex,fdj1oi3,t1_fdj15hr,1578456154.0,They’re not 100% proof positive.
relationship_advice,fdj1m6h,t3_eln772,1578456109.0,"I can’t help but to giggle at this a bit because I’m the best female friend in this situation and know how it is when my best guy friend gets into a relationship. 

It really does sound like you’re thinking to much about it. If she’s never done anything to get between you and him and has even distanced herself you shouldn’t be mad or even take offense to it because that’s probably her way of respecting the relationship he has with you. 

Sounds like her gift was really nice and well thought out."
