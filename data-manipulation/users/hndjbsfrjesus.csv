history,ff89t4s,t1_ff7v8tz,1579670264.0,"I've seen it several times and done it a couple of  times, although always with a transfer of said person to a branch office in another country. Typically there is an exchange of employees between both parties.

If they don't want to move, they can find a job with a competitor. If they do, they will be way out of their comfort zone and have to convince people in a different culture of their skills.

If the first, it's addition by subtraction for us and a likely negative to the competitor. If the second, they get to experience a new culture, pick up best practices from the other office, and learn something about themselves.

The second situation is why I think everyone should work abroad a bit during any career. It's scary AF, but if you can put in good work where you don't speak the language yet, you can crush it when you get back home. It also teaches a critical life skill: seeing things from multiple points of view.

Futurology,fdvnfoh,t1_fdtbzly,1578749412.0,"Nicely noted. I Came here to share that proton therapy has much less back-scattering of the ionizing radiation because most the energy is deposited into the target tissue and does not pass all the way through the patient. This results in a teardrop-shaped energy deposition envelope. 

Put another way, the protons decelerate more quickly than electrons and drop most of their energy in the target tissue. This spares the healthy tissue on the other side (or backside) of the tumor from the beam source. In contrast, the electron beam deposits energy into the healthy tissue between the beam and the source, drops some energy into the tumor, and continues into the healthy tissue on the other side of the tumor."
