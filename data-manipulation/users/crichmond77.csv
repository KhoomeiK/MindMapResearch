It would be very, very surprising if the Nuggets won it all this year. No one is giving them a real shot, despite having a player that's also a fringe top 10 guy and a much better surrounding cast than Dame has."

Will be interesting to see Moses's development as far as the calls and checks go, with a whole season to do nothing but study up. If he can get the cerebral part really locked down and be even 90% of where he was physically, he'll be first team All America."
rolltide,ff6hf8e,t1_ff6grcv,1579627264.0,"Smith coming backs means the WRs are once again a guaranteed strength. With him and Waddle both established stars, you only need one more starter (presumably Metchie) to be at full force.

With no Ruggs or Jeudy, you'd think Smith sees more targets. But with Najee/B-Rob/Sanders back, Waddle alongside, and no Tua, I'm not sure it'll be a substantial increase so much as a moderate uptick."
