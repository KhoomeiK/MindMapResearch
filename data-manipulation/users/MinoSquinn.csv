relationship_advice,fglbxgw,t3_ez647t,1580890017.0,"5 years is a very long time for a close relationship of any kind. To just cut out someone that you have had a bond with for half a decade isn’t that easy. 

And I’m sorry, but she’s not really *your girl*, is she?"
relationship_advice,fgje3kp,t3_eyuqth,1580842121.0,"Sounds like you’re doing what you can for your siblings. I highly recommend moving out anyways as you’re 23 and that alone can destroy your mental health (trust me I know). Your dad should sign the papers and get to an AA meeting, like now. If their fights are as aggressive and violent as you say, sounds like your mom has good reason for wanting a new life. I’m sorry that you and your siblings are going through this. Your mom definitely shouldn’t have put you all in that position, she should have waited to start dating until she was separated or divorced, but she has a right to live a happy life too."

First of all, why is she kissing other people’s kids?  I work with children and can tell you that is completely inappropriate. 

Second, that’s not how cold sores work. The fact that she said all that about the kids parents having them, makes me think she may be hiding something. She’s trying to cover tracks by giving you that story. 

Also, cold sores can be dormant for a very long time and come up out of the blue so maybe nothing has happened."
relationship_advice,ff4h27c,t3_erlpni,1579563432.0,"It might not seem like it, but there’s a huge difference between a 27 year old female and a 25 year old male. Your body is telling you it wants to have a baby and his is saying to have fun. 

I’m 28f without any children and I also want them but not for a few years. My bf is 31 and saying he’s finally ready to have a kid in the next few years, but at 25 he FREAKED out whenever the idea of kids was mentioned. 

I know you don’t want to wait until you’re in your 30s, but women have perfectly healthy pregnancies until 40+ even. I’ve had friends who were in their 20s have major complications and then my 44 year old cousin had a perfect pregnancy and birth...so id say if you really love the guy and want him to be your baby daddy and life mate, then you should compromise and wait a few years if he is open to the idea of ever having kids."

You have a child to think about and support, and you deserve a true soul mate and a better best friend. 
It’s nice that he was there for you before, but he obviously doesn’t care about you as much as you thought he did. 

Here for you if you need to talk, OP. Try not to rationalize staying with a cheater, although I know it’s difficult not to if you care about them."
