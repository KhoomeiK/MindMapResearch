progun,fgu5azv,t1_fgu1zfy,1581113541.0,There are third party candidates here. It's only due to people who think they HAVE to vote for Rep or Dem that don't give TPC a chance.
progun,fgu53hi,t1_fgtlqy0,1581113448.0,I can't believe anyone would vote for anyone that wants to restrict your rights period.
Justrolledintotheshop,fgrtnzh,t1_fgrd2yu,1581057175.0,"I'm the same. I pretty much understand how everything works together and can identify most of the parts and know how not to get ripped off from being my dad's tool holder while he worked on stuff, but I have only a small amount of mechanical DIY ability (filters, fluids, some sensors, wipers, bulbs, and spark plugs are the bulk of my limited skills ... And some body work stuff). When it comes to brakes, that's something I prefer to have a pro do. Yes, I can follow YT and probably can figure it out, but I don't want to accept the risk of screwing up. 

Yup, someone is making money off me, but the car stops properly, so wins all around."

Please let me be honest to you, based on your posts, OP:

He does not actually love you. 

He does not respect you at all.

He does not like you.

He wants to manipulate, control, and hurt you. It makes him feel better about himself to do this to you.

I'm sorry. I know you don't want to hear this, OP, but it's true. You deserve better. You need to get yourself to safety."
greenville,fgprwur,t3_ezu8pc,1581010819.0,FYI Pelham between Garlington and 14 is closed due to a gas leak. Still reported on Waze at last check a second ago.
childfree,fgp1zqp,t1_fgogy6i,1580994611.0,I feel bad for the fetus already. They're going to be in for a wild ride with that woman.
Justrolledintotheshop,fgoesgx,t1_fgm8anf,1580967549.0,I ran over a broken railroad spike once on a dirt road. That was a quick ass flat tire. The closest track was 30 miles away. I can only guess at how it ended up there.

Cruise,fgly5ox,t1_fglreet,1580913799.0,"While I'm not worried about my trip on Saturday, in the highly unlikely event that someone tested positive that affected my ship, I am glad that for this itinerary I booked a balcony for my first time."
motorcitykitties,fglwa7w,t3_ez5nfs,1580912477.0,I never heard of the Tiger stripe sock rumor but I remember the Light Guard origins bring taught in my Michigan history class in middle school.
rescuedogs,fgl1nnj,t1_fgkpq2v,1580879254.0,"Get, just as an FYI, they are really cheap on black Friday and Amazon day if you have the patience to wait. If you do the breed only one first, they will send you something like $20 off the genetic test upgrade after your results come in.

I did the test on my rescue. 10/10."
Cruise,fgkmrxz,t1_fgiokk2,1580869122.0,"I bring small powder drink mixer packets (think crystal light, etc) and an empty water bottle. It's a great way to save if you don't want to buy drinks."
