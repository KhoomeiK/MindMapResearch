gaming,ff9pv6d,t1_ff9oj14,1579718293.0,"Here's the difference:

In a videogame when you 'kill' something/someone you are in fact not doing that action instead you are making some shit happen in a game with no consequences of the thing dying after it's turned off. When you shoot a gun in a game no real gun is shot. No animals/people die. 

In a videogame when you gamble (real or 'premium' currency) the effects of the gambling activity are real. Real money is lost. Real gambling tendencies are born (because guess what, gambling is still gambling if it's on a PC screen or through a slot machine... that probably has a screen) regardless of age bracket it is an activity that has tangible affects both inside and outside the game. A real wager is placed. A prize is given. 

The only way I can see gambling as being 'acceptable' in a videogame is when there is no monetary input. Then it is just a game. If they want to put casino mechanics where kids eyes and hands are, they best be ready to accept verified ID least they get in trouble just like a casino would if they were caught with underage patrons.

Edit: I just wanted to add that I don't believe gambling is safe at any age at any capacity and doesn't add any benefit to society except to siphon off money from people who are vulnerable and susceptible to the predatory tactics they use. Then when people get into real gambling issues it becomes everyone else's problem (homelessness, bankruptcy, etc.)"

Somehow I had hit the lock button getting out and my phone was nice and secure with all my contacts (the only phone numbers I know by heart are my family) no AAA either. I walked into the gas station to ask the clerk if I could call a locksmith cause I had somehow locked myself out. The dude behind me in line taps my shoulder and says that he just got off his shift and had all his tools in his work truck. I was a bit confused but then I realized the motherfucker was a locksmith. We took a walk to his truck and he got a little rod with a handle and got my door open in under a minute. Normally that would be like a $80 call and that dude helped me out for free even after I offered to pay him. Some people are just nice.

To make the xp go by faster still though, I think that they should be built into the relic tiers. Ie. Tier one grants you the base 5x xp, tier 2 adds 2x (total 7x) tier tree adds 3x for 10x total etc.

Relics that change gameplay like harvester and clue hunter and focus etc. Are all great because they let you play the game differently rather than just gain xp faster."

Usually it's not much of a problem but there are definitely areas where you end up just tiles away from the border of the next 'area' and then if you want to adventure that way you end up with a big janky pause in the game. 

I know there are more pressing issues and I know they likely can't make areas have a larger 'interactable' space but laying an extra 600kb of map when you go through an area terms of not hundreds of times seems like it could be reasonable, even if you need to turn the feature on and confirm you have adequate memory available."

First quizmaster I had done in like five years. Hard clue. Lmao can't even do it since I'm staying 10hp on that account until I finish with firemaking at wintertodt.

PublicFreakout,fdoif1v,t1_fdog35w,1578605780.0,"On New year's I was outside on the fire escape at my buddy's apartment and these two guys rolun out of the bar ready to fight. The first guy was instigating and the second guy almost got held back enough by his girlfriend not to engage. But he turned around and was following the first guy who was backing up into the road when he (first guy) quickly changed to moving forwards and sloppily  sucker punched the other guy in the face just enough to make him fall the other way and absolutely slap his face on the pavement. He was out cold for like a minute and a half before he eventually got up with the help of his GF and they all scurried away. He really did not look okay and I offered to send the guy the video but he just wanted revenge and I didn't want any part of it. Really surprised the cops never showed because on New year's they are going up and down main Street like a every 30 seconds. But I think another fight had broken out cause there were lights I could see from cruisers elsewhere.

I don't know how the guy is doing but it's really got to blow having a head injury and likely at least a concussion an hour and a half into the new year."
