Peterson says that women are more prone to depression and anxiety because they like to conform and are more agreeable with society. And men exhibit much more anti social behavior. 

But depression and anxiety are anti-social behavior. The whole episode was full of a lot of shit. 

He said that the left is more empathetic that’s why they want total equality. But the issue isn’t about social structure, rather it’s capitalism. Capitalism is a disease."

philosophy,ff2d4ws,t1_ff2bpdr,1579501342.0,"I am not religious in the normal sense. I am more atheist, than religious. I am simply open minded and was bringing up how I was raised. Self love is well and good, so is bringing joy to others. Those things are temporal, they pass it’s fleeting. I’m sure a life lives for others is a life worth living. But asking questions about why we exist and have experience of reality is very important. Arriving at these answers I think will give humanity a greater purpose. It will create more peace and less suffering. It will allow humans to use each other as an end in themselves, and not a means to an end. Many people already function this way, but not the majority and certain now the capitalist, controlling or powerful class."
philosophy,ff2crku,t1_ff28tgj,1579500960.0,"Existentialism is a fascinating philosophy and I am a philosophy student myself I have studied it quite a bit. Subjective meaning is well and good, but to arrive and truth we have to dig deeper. I will live my life and hopefully shed some answers to these questions. I am familiar with all those fringe theories as well. They are interesting, like shared consciousness, oneness between all conscious awareness ect. They are very hard to prove, and it’s like an ant trying to figure out that it’s living on earth. 

We are part of this physical system so it’s hard to see the bigger picture. But I see these type of questions as the most important ones, and I am happy to dedicate myself in search after them so that hopefully others can add on them at some point and eventually if we ever find an answer then others won’t have to worry about these types of questions and work on other things. 

I was planning to see a psychiatrist I read a lot about anti depressants and I don’t know if they are more good than bad. Being depressed is natural, there is a certain truth in it it gives a specific perspective of reality. Being depressed seems like a normal reaction to the type of world we live in, or maybe it’s this specific way of thinking about things. I know a lot of philosophers are depressed and many in the past have struggled with it as well. I don’t wish to exist, but I am not suicidal. It’s a fine difference. 

The issue is when it becomes crippling and prevents one from doing normal things like being a productive member of society, working and contributing. I struggle with that. I am debating about the psychiatrist if I can’t sort it out myself. Might deviate more towards psychedelics, a lot of research about shrooms and how they help elevate these types of thoughts. And they are much healthier and more natural than anti-depressants. 

Thanks for your time."
philosophy,ff27xet,t1_ff20axw,1579496399.0,"Time will tell, and death will reveal the truth. I was raised in Islam. I didn’t have a choice to exist or not in this world. We are forced into existence and forced to adapt to what our environment gives us. Technology and advances in science will put us away from god and religion and faith, that’s the world we are heading in. Capitalism devalues human life, people in power do not respect the sanctity of life and personhood. We are all slaves to our environments and circumstance. The abrahamic religions were born together, although they all call each other misguided there is a shared love for each other that will always be there. I love what is eternal in you, the piece of god you have, your soul. Thank you for your time and input."
philosophy,ff1ynhd,t1_ff1vyk2,1579489210.0,"I struggle with religion, it’s too flawed most religious figureheads are hypocrites and never follow what they preach. Religion has a become a way to control people and make money off of them and used as a means to get away with much. Pedophelia, war, money and power. God might exist, but one would think a powerful being can create a better system and illuminate us with truth and the right direction. Not this mess of endless different, conflicting religions that only lead to divide humanity from each other. 

We are all made of the same thing, what we could call a soul. A piece of god in a sense if he were to exist. Yet, we degrade, murder, rape, essentially god himself as what we do to each other is as if we do against god. Society is driven by the wrong structures, like capitalism, power, control. Everyone is lost and they cling into anything that can distract them even momentarily from the meaningless abyss sitting next to us. We are living on a planet in a vast universe beyond our comprehension. Lost in an abyss unable to find answers so we invent and try to find meaning in meaningless.

Humanity has lost its way, I truly believe if god does love us he would have to send another prophet. And reset the world anew so to say. Although god has done this many times to no avail. But times are different now, and we can preserve truth and protect it better than people were able to 2000 years ago. Religion becomes a fairy tale over time. Trusting humans to pass gods message unaltered is a mistake god has made. We don’t have a choice in what religion we are born in, so much misinformation and hell awaits all others who don’t follow whatever religion you were born it. It seems almost silly and there are so many better ways for god to show us what he wants of us. 

Humans are corrupt, if god did pass his message to us at one point it is lost to us. And we will all go to hell for sure for something outside of our control, and for simply not being able to choose the right religion if any of them are actually true. We need direction, the world is more atheist than ever, and will continue to be so. We need god to interfere, but conveniently all religious text says he never will and that is to our detriment. We are lost."
philosophy,ff1xclf,t1_ff1iah9,1579488329.0,"It’s not about good or bad life decisions. I just can’t find meaning in life or in the world we live in. It’s all pointless, we live life with void and meaninglessness right there sitting next to us. The idea of finding a subjective meaning to reality is an illusion. We will never find answers to things like why we are experiencing reality. Which is essentially what is the purpose of being aware of our existence. 

Death is a change of perspective we can’t find answers in life but we might find something in death. Life leads to death, if you look at it very simply the purpose of living is to die. I like to seek out truth, and maybe in death we will find some truth or nothing at all."

It is great that the gesture effected this person so, and they found one sort of meaning in a meaningless world. But their existence is still meaningless so is everyone else’s. That is an irrefutable truth. 

I don’t man to belittle that persons depression, but if that is all it took to help them along then it wasn’t too bad to start with. Judging how people experience reality and how things effect them is not something I like to do. But it’s good that persons depression was weak enough to become manageable after that interaction, and that’s what really matters. Even if it is a delusion one plays on themselves, as long as it does the job and allows them to hide away from the bitter truth of reality."
