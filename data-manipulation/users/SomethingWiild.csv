Advice,fg4h2ij,t1_fg30wg8,1580503193.0,"You can say literally the same thing you just said here, when talking to him! You said it perfectly. 

“Hey, I’m feeling unhappy with our relationship right now can we please talk?”

It really feels as if you don’t appreciate the effort I’ve been putting into our relationship lately, and it makes me more unhappy when you mock me each time I bring something up that’s been bothering me.

That should get the convo going, just make it known you’re being serious and he needs to take it seriously. Conversations like this are necessary in maintaining a healthy happy relationship. If he truly won’t be serious... it’s just not gonna work, my friend."
Advice,fg4fpzk,t1_fg48nth,1580502548.0,"I agree that this is nothing to worry over, and nobody seems to have any ill feelings towards you!

If it would make you feel better, you could somehow make it known that you got invited by saying you were having a good time, thanks for the invite, and hopefully you can do it again sometime! 

Honestly even saying that is probably unnecessary but maybe it would make YOU feel better about it?"
JusticeServed,fg484r7,t3_ewjxwq,1580498168.0,"Here’s what she says in her speech in the video for anyone who wants to read it: sorry if format is shitty. 


“This is by far the most fun I’ve had in a very long time. I am not used to receiving awards, it is strange. It’s strange to hear nice things being said about yourself. You sit there and think “wait a minute, they’re saying that about ME!”  Where as normally, it is a kind of deluge of fireballs coming my way. So, it’s kind of an odd thing for that to be tipped on its head. I really do appreciate it! “( then the scene cuts)

“If you call “ Mohammed” in a school playground in the UK, 2,000 fucking kids come running & you don’t want ANY of them” (cut)

“ Epileptics are weirdos. They’re right up there with the asians!” (Cut)

“East London is very shitty at the best of times. 82% Muslim, what can I say?” (Cut)

 “most of those people are raping their own mother” (cut)

“I guess Muslim’s are different!” (Cut)

“And she... I believe her name was *speaks nothing but gibberish *... and her  fiancé, I believe his name was *speaks gibberish and pretends to spit *...Anyway, they practise because they’re such rrreeeetardsss”... (cut)

“Other places, where people get stabbed a lot. Or rape their own mothers, or have 5 wives *laughs * (cut)

“Gretta?! (In mocking accent) how dare youuu!.. Autistic fucking wench!”

We fed them frozen grapes as a treat. But they never got sick, or even got the shits. They lived to be 13 and 15, respectively."
canada,ffxcddm,t1_ffwptq6,1580322259.0,"I agree with you, but they push the hashtag because apparently they make some kind of monetary donation to a mental health charity organization for each and every time the tag is used (on the day) 

I can’t verify if they really follow through on that promise, but that’s what they say, anyway."

 Yes it’s totally gross and I’m not defending her at ALL. But what has she done wrong? Like, what exactly could you even “report” to HR in this instance?"

worldnews,ffo6gms,t1_ffnzw5w,1580074602.0,"Getting infected does not  equal death every time. 

This virus is commonly known, and the only people truly at risk for death after infection  are elderly (over the age of 60) young children/infants and people with weakened immune systems due to illness or disease (like diabetes/heart disease, smokers, Things like that). The average person will recover from the illness much like they would if they had the flu."
worldnews,ffo3zs7,t1_ffnxagb,1580073889.0,"No,  not like influenza. 

Influenza has an incubation period of 3 days- meaning you are unknowingly spreading the virus for around 3 days before showing symptoms of any kind.

Coronavirus has an incubation period of 14 days, meaning you are spreading the virus for 2 weeks before you even realize you’re sick. Think of how many people you encounter over a 2 week period (especially vs. a period of only 3 days). This is a HUGE deal!"

trashy,feiff29,t1_fehpri0,1579137259.0,"What she said in the clip was that she thought his lip was sexy, which is not “real shitty”.  The issue here is not at all about what she said. She sang nothing but praise for him. 

It was her action of mimicking what the cleft lip looks like to her audience (because she couldn’t remember the name for it) that’s pretty shitty and uncalled for. She should have been more professional. 

I’m not trying to be a hater, here. or to be aggressive. Definitely not defending Wendy in this situation. But  You talk about how cancelled culture needs to stop, when you clearly are just listening to the people here who are  doing the cancelling, and not actually looking into the situation before saying  that what she SAID was shitty. We can do better than this, can’t we fam? :)"
