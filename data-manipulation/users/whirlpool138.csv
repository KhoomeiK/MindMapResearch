It has been a huge industry here for a very very long time, probably even longer than California. The type used in NE's wine are usually a cold hardy type too. These posts are straight bullshit. There is no way buying wine from California is more energy efficient than buying local wine if you live in Connecticut, Rhode Island or Massachusetts. Who freezes their wine anyway?

When people say buy local, no one means out of season food that has been frozen for some reason. They mean fresh, in season produce that comes straight from the farm."

I live in a region that is arguably colder and snowier than New England, with less sun light, yet we have a thriving grape and wine industry. Hell, across the border from me in Canada, they have a thriving grape and wine industry.

nfl,ff77veh,t1_ff6i1r3,1579642848.0,"As an outsider, do you think the Bills are set up well for the future compared to the other teams or that Josh Allen is the real deal? A lot of people shit on Allen after the loss to the Texans, but he wasn't the one who let the Texans come back after being down 16 points and still managed to drive the offense down field twice at the end of the game. I might just be a homer but I saw a lot of Brett Favre in him at the end of the game, with him making risky moves just to make something happen and get a chance to win. Everyone said he panicked but I thought he did pretty well for being such a raw player, coming from a small market school and getting shit on by the analysts since he was drafted."

nfl,ff768i3,t1_ff6eik9,1579641933.0,"As a Bills fan, I think that the recent Falcons and Seahawks Superbowl losses were worse than the 1st Bills Wide Right Superbowl loss. My reasoning is that those two losses came down to something that the teams could have controlled their destiny (by running the ball instead of passing on the goal line, or running the ball to wait out the clock). While the wide right kick was a last ditch effort and unlikely to make it through before the attempt even happened. I remember both times saying to my friends that at least finally another team had a bigger heart breaking moment than Wide Right. The Seahawks loss wasn't as bad but at the time, everyone was so pumped up that the catch was made and so sure Lynch was gonna run it in (then the interception happened and players started fighting on the field). 

The Falcons loss was by far the worst though, since they were so fucking far ahead. Once the Patriots started coming back, everyone I was with started saying it was over for the Falcons even though they were ahead by nearly 20 points. The momentum had totally switched by half time.

The funny thing is that all three of those Superbowl losses (arguably the three biggest heart breaking moments in Superbowl history) came at the hands of Bill Belichick. I think that really says something about his ability to coach and how clutch his teams have been."

I remember everyone going home early, turning off the tv and making me go to bed during the 4th one (but not really anything about the actual game). I do remember the Flutie years, 1999 Stanley Cup and 05/06 Sabres teams pretty well. Prior to these last two playoff appearances, the most optimistic time I remember being a Bills fan was the Fitzpatrick/Lynch/TO years (if that says anything). People got remember, that for millennial Buffalonians, most of the Bills games were actually unwatchable because they were always blacked out for TV broadcasts. I always had to listen to them on the radio. The tailgating scene wasn't always there too, that's a relatively new thing that came from the millennial generation. People weren't smashing tables 10-15 years ago.

I lived in Tallahassee when FSU was dominating college football with Winston 6 years ago (crazy to think it's already been that long) and it was so weird to me. It was cool living in a city with a champion winning team but I couldn't get 100% behind it. Partly because of the shady shit the team did and also partly because the city/school didn't really seem to appreciate the runs. People came across more like they expected them to win, probably how I imagine people in New England act towards the Patriots. As far as local support and hype goes, the Bills making the wildcard playoff spot this year was like night and day to FSU actually winning the national championship in Tallahassee."

nfl,ff7004p,t1_ff5xl61,1579638381.0,"The Bills didn't just lose 4 Superbowls. Their all time star player, OJ Simpson, had the trial of the century during the last year of the Superbowl runs. A native to the Buffalo area, Timothy McVeigh, blew up the Oklahoma City building a year or so later. A high profile abortion doctor was assassinated in a Buffalo suburb the year after that. Then roughly 2-3 years later, the Buffalo Sabre got screwed out of the Stanley Cup in the No Goal incident in 1999. Former Bills QB, Jack Kemp lost the election as a vice president candidate. The Sabres star player Lafontaine had to retire early due to a concussion history and the other star player, Mogilny, was traded away (to make cap space for Lafontaine ironically) and because he was threatened by the Russian mob (they supposedly were going to bomb one of his flights to away games) and couldn't play a full season. The last of Buffalo's biggest industrial factories also closed.

The 1990s were by far the worst decade in Buffalo's history and 99% of the city's nation stigma comes from it. Every time we were in the national news it was for something negative or really really bad. Cleveland has had it bad but never anything as bad as what the city of Buffalo went through."

AskReddit,ff57yxe,t1_ff4m6gj,1579582897.0,"The word meme really is just a word for a cultural gene (biologist Richard Dawkins coined it) so you are technically right. A meme is a cultural trait that is passed down and evolves over time. The Wendigo was a folk tale that was passed around different native tribes who lived around the Great Lakes, Adirondacks, Northern Great Plains and Canadian Shield."
AskReddit,ff57s1y,t1_ff4kgyj,1579582728.0,"It is partly that (explaining how people got lost out in the woods and scare people) and partly to explain why people would go mad or turn to cannibalism. The Wendigo moves with the wind and through the trees, so if you have ever been camping in the winter or  caught in a white out snow storm, you can kinda see how it can come up as a tale. 

One of the regions that the Wendigio is located in, the Adirondacks in Upstate NY, has a cool folk lore legend for the name. Adirondacks is what the Haundosaunee (the Iroquois) would call their rivals, the Algonquians. Adirondack meant bark eaters,  meaning those people up in the deep woods and mountains starved so badly during the winter, that they had to turn to eating bark (or each other). The Haundosaunee adopted the Wendigo tales as a way to further demonize their rivals (but also legitimately feared it themselves)."
AskReddit,ff57dez,t1_ff45j0u,1579582370.0,"Traditionally the Wendigo doesn't even really  take a physical form. It moves in the wind and through the forests as a spirit. During the winter months, when food is scarce and smow storms are blowing hard, the forces of nature (the Wendigo) would drive people mad and into cannibalism. Other times it is an invisible force moving through the woods that would call out a person and lure them into the forest before dragging them off into the sky.

When ever I would go camping in the Adirondacks and we would hear the trees cracking in the wind, my friends and I would joke about the Wendigo moving through the woods. Sorta like how that 1st person camera moves as a force in the Evil Dead (honestly the Evil Dead might be the best cinematic representation of the Wendigo even though it is supposed to be some Egyptian demon). Look up that tale that appeared in Scary Stories in the Dark about the hunter Defago's encounter with the Wendigo.

1 There are other native tales that it would be a humanoid monster that could grow to gigantic sizes and eat people. The modern depiction of the Wendigo as a part deer/elk/bat/human thing came later on and was probably influenced by the Jersey Devil."

All you gotta do is sit on a penny, nickel or dime slot machine and order one of the free complimentary drinks when the waitress comes by (you can get hammered drunk off of spending about $5-10). 

If you are planning on watching the fight and looking for a good venue to check it out, the Seneca Niagara casino is one of the best places to watch a big event like this, since the main gaming floor is massive (at least by WNY standards) and it gets filled in by people like a concert or live sporting event (but not really crowded, the space is so big there is plenty of room to move around). It's cool being there when hundreds of people react to the big moments all at the same time. If you are looking for something more laid back and smaller scale, I am sure that the Buffalo Creek casino at Canalside will also have it on but without a crowd as large as the ones that show up in the Falls."

From the creation of Star Wars, when it was called something like the Adventures of Starkiller taken from the Journal of the Whillis Lucas, wanted it to become a huge saga.

Buffalo,fe4fsm4,t1_fe45y7h,1578858797.0,"The problem with commuter rail is, where would you put it? All of the train tracks in the falls either are still being used by CSX to transport material from the factories or directly pass through the factory complexes. The one corridor that I can imagine a commuter rail line going through is down Buffalo Avenue, but then you either need to have the commuter trains passing through places like the Occidental plant. The plan that I always liked, would have traffic off the South Bound Robert Moses/Niagara Scenic Parkway get pushed over to Buffalo Avenue ( then have Buffalo Avenue's lanes get widened and the speed limit raised to 45-55 mph, everyone already speeds through that part anyway). Use that part of the parkway to extend the light rail from Buffalo, through the Tonawandas into downtown Niagara Falls. Then have the state park trolleys ferry people from the end terminus of the light rail over to the new train station, where people can then be allowed to walk across the Whirlpool bridge to the GO train station. I know this is just a pipe dream and unrealistic though, but it would be the big ""silver bullet"" project that I think could actually change Niagara Falls.

The other way would be to go through the city's North end, which has a route directly from the Tonawandas. But those tracks are super bogged down by CSX traffic and you would have to pass through the Hyde Park train yard.  When you take the Amtrak Empire line from NYC to Niagara Falls, it takes forever to get through this last little bit even though you are so close to the ending destination.

I am with you on having a commuter rail connecting  Buffalo to Niagara Falls  making more sense, but a whole lot will have to change to get to that point. I am not sure if you are aware of the situation with the new GO train connection between Niagara Falls and Toronto on the Canadian side. The stop for the GO train in Niagara Falls is at the old train station at the end of the Canadian end of the Whirlpool bridge. Niagara Falls, NY just spent several million last decade rehabbing the old customs house into the new Amtrak station on our side. We are so close to have a direction rail connection between Buffalo-Niagara Falls-Toronto.

Except the train station on the NY side was planned horribly. The gauge of the tracks won't fit the type that the GO trains use. You can take the Empire Line from Buffalo, down to Niagara Falls, but if you want to hop on the GO train (which is directly across the river from the NY station), you have to walk or drive all the way down to the Rainbow bridge, cross there and then go all the way back up to the Whirlpool bridge train station on the Canadian side because the Whirlpool bridge is closed to pedestrian traffic. Even though the Whirlpool bridge is right there, the only other way to cross it would be to find a taxi, uber or some friendly Canadian that has a nexus pass and that is willing to give you a life across the bridge.

So the new mayor of Niagara Falls has said that he wants the GO train to extend across the bridge to our side (which makes sense and would give WNY a direct mass transit route to Toronto), but that can't happen unless they totally rip up and reconfigure the gauge of the rails. The last two mayors wanted a faster commuter rail between Buffalo and Niagara Falls (which is a big part of the reason why the new train station was developed), but CSX has shot down and fought against any changes being made to their rail routes. That train yard off of Hyde Park Boulevard is the main obstacle in it's way and has been judged to be too important to the city's industrial economy. We are so so close to having a great mass transit system in the Golden Horseshoe region but like everything else in this region, it is bogged down by red tape.

The most realistic way to handle it would have a commuter rail extend from Buffalo to Niagara Falls through the city's industrial North End. Open up pedestrian walking traffic on the Whirlpool bridge so that once you get off the commuter rail, you can just walk across the bridge, pass through customs and then jump on the GO train to Toronto. Use the new train station as a transit hub, with NFTA buses and the state park trolleys departing and returning there. The bus terminal on portage road already really sucks and needs to be updated and there is no central hub for tourists to get on the state park trolleys. The extra space in the train station can be used for customs processing for those coming in from Canada (and the building was originally built as a customs house!). You would just need to get some type of custom agent barriers built at the end of the NY side of the Whirlpool bridge and build up that area a little bit. I think it could also bring a lot of traffic into the new Underground railroad museum and especially on to Main street."

 Setting up a 4 day trip that is something like Fly into Pearson Airport in Toronto on Thursday--->stay a night in downtown Toronto (Friday)--->take the rail or bus to Niagara Falls (Saturday, Sunday)--->visit all the sights at the Falls (Saturday)--->find a rideshare/take an Uber/rent a car to get to the Bill's game (Sunday)---> party at the tailgate Sunday morning, go watch the game all afternoon, then hit up the city of Buffalo afterwards--->fly home from Toronto on Sunday. That would be a totally solid vacation and worth the time off/money paid. 

If you want to come to the Golden Horseshoe area (Toronto-Niagara Falls-Buffalo megalopolis) for a couple more days, you can rent a car and venture out to see more. Algonquin Park is one of Canada's most famous natural recreational areas, Letchworth Park on the NY is a 5 star state park with it's own set of giant (but less famous waterfalls). Both are close by. You could probably catch a hockey game with the Toronto Maple Leafs or Buffalo Sabres too. Niagara Falls, Ontario is like the Orlando or Las Vegas of Canada. Buffalo has a ton of great Art Deco architecture and greasy calorie dense American sized food portions at it's restaurants. There is a lot to do here and being a Britist national should give you easy access into Canada (with the whole Commonwealth and all)."

Seriously if you are going to bash the management practices of the Adirondack Park and point to aerial images on Google, while not even acknowledge how there was barely any forest in the area before the park was founded, then dude you are clueless.

Shit, a hundred or two hundred years ago, these areas were even more degraded then they are now (I am talking about spaces actually within the National Parks, Forests, Recreational Areas, Wildlife Refugees). 
Also not everything needs to be a straight up forest, an ecosystem needs stuff like  meadows and parries to thrive too.

 The United States devoted way more land to agriculture and timber harvesting a hundred years ago then they do now. Even the way you dumb down forestry management practices with ""plant it, wait, cut it down"" just confuses me why you would simplify something that is super complex and involves serious management practices. There are several stages of forest growth too, from first succession, to 2nd succession, going all the way up to old growth. Looking at aerial images from your computer is in noway going to tell the whole picture about an ecosystems  health.

 For instance, the Adirondack Park in Upstate New York was nearly wiped out by clear cropping at the turn of the 20th century, but now it is the largest tract of preserved/conserved land in the lower 48. The Smokey Mountains were like that. Shenandoah was like that. The Everglades were set on fire by natives and cleared out.

While the wide right kick was a last ditch effort and unlikely to make it through before the attempt even happened. I remember both times saying to my friends that at least finally another team had a bigger heart breaking moment than Wide Right. The Seahawks loss wasn't as bad but at the time, everyone was so pumped up that the catch was made and so sure Lynch was gonna run it in (then the interception happened and players started fighting on the field). 

The Falcons loss was by far the worst though, since they were so fucking far ahead. Once the Patriots started coming back, everyone I was with started saying it was over for the Falcons even though they were ahead by nearly 20 points. The momentum had totally switched by half time.

One of the regions that the Wendigio is located in, the Adirondacks in Upstate NY, has a cool folk lore legend for the name. Adirondacks is what the Haundosaunee (the Iroquois) would call their rivals, the Algonquians. Adirondack meant bark eaters,  meaning those people up in the deep woods and mountains starved so badly during the winter, that they had to turn to eating bark (or each other). The Haundosaunee adopted the Wendigo tales as a way to further demonize their rivals (but also legitimately feared it themselves)."
AskReddit,ff57dez,t1_ff45j0u,1579582370.0,"Traditionally the Wendigo doesn't even really  take a physical form. It moves in the wind and through the forests as a spirit. During the winter months, when food is scarce and smow storms are blowing hard, the forces of nature (the Wendigo) would drive people mad and into cannibalism. Other times it is an invisible force moving through the woods that would call out a person and lure them into the forest before dragging them off into the sky.

When ever I would go camping in the Adirondacks and we would hear the trees cracking in the wind, my friends and I would joke about the Wendigo moving through the woods. Sorta like how that 1st person camera moves as a force in the Evil Dead (honestly the Evil Dead might be the best cinematic representation of the Wendigo even though it is supposed to be some Egyptian demon). Look up that tale that appeared in Scary Stories in the Dark about the hunter Defago's encounter with the Wendigo.

1 There are other native tales that it would be a humanoid monster that could grow to gigantic sizes and eat people. The modern depiction of the Wendigo as a part deer/elk/bat/human thing came later on and was probably influenced by the Jersey Devil."

If you are planning on watching the fight and looking for a good venue to check it out, the Seneca Niagara casino is one of the best places to watch a big event like this, since the main gaming floor is massive (at least by WNY standards) and it gets filled in by people like a concert or live sporting event (but not really crowded, the space is so big there is plenty of room to move around). It's cool being there when hundreds of people react to the big moments all at the same time.

Buffalo,fe4fsm4,t1_fe45y7h,1578858797.0,"The problem with commuter rail is, where would you put it? All of the train tracks in the falls either are still being used by CSX to transport material from the factories or directly pass through the factory complexes. The one corridor that I can imagine a commuter rail line going through is down Buffalo Avenue, but then you either need to have the commuter trains passing through places like the Occidental plant. The plan that I always liked, would have traffic off the South Bound Robert Moses/Niagara Scenic Parkway get pushed over to Buffalo Avenue ( then have Buffalo Avenue's lanes get widened and the speed limit raised to 45-55 mph, everyone already speeds through that part anyway). Use that part of the parkway to extend the light rail from Buffalo, through the Tonawandas into downtown Niagara Falls. Then have the state park trolleys ferry people from the end terminus of the light rail over to the new train station, where people can then be allowed to walk across the Whirlpool bridge to the GO train station. I know this is just a pipe dream and unrealistic though, but it would be the big ""silver bullet"" project that I think could actually change Niagara Falls.

The other way would be to go through the city's North end, which has a route directly from the Tonawandas. But those tracks are super bogged down by CSX traffic and you would have to pass through the Hyde Park train yard.  When you take the Amtrak Empire line from NYC to Niagara Falls, it takes forever to get through this last little bit even though you are so close to the ending destination.

I am with you on having a commuter rail connecting  Buffalo to Niagara Falls  making more sense, but a whole lot will have to change to get to that point. I am not sure if you are aware of the situation with the new GO train connection between Niagara Falls and Toronto on the Canadian side. The stop for the GO train in Niagara Falls is at the old train station at the end of the Canadian end of the Whirlpool bridge. Niagara Falls, NY just spent several million last decade rehabbing the old customs house into the new Amtrak station on our side. We are so close to have a direction rail connection between Buffalo-Niagara Falls-Toronto.

Except the train station on the NY side was planned horribly. The gauge of the tracks won't fit the type that the GO trains use. You can take the Empire Line from Buffalo, down to Niagara Falls, but if you want to hop on the GO train (which is directly across the river from the NY station), you have to walk or drive all the way down to the Rainbow bridge, cross there and then go all the way back up to the Whirlpool bridge train station on the Canadian side because the Whirlpool bridge is closed to pedestrian traffic. Even though the Whirlpool bridge is right there, the only other way to cross it would be to find a taxi, uber or some friendly Canadian that has a nexus pass and that is willing to give you a life across the bridge.

So the new mayor of Niagara Falls has said that he wants the GO train to extend across the bridge to our side (which makes sense and would give WNY a direct mass transit route to Toronto), but that can't happen unless they totally rip up and reconfigure the gauge of the rails. The last two mayors wanted a faster commuter rail between Buffalo and Niagara Falls (which is a big part of the reason why the new train station was developed), but CSX has shot down and fought against any changes being made to their rail routes. That train yard off of Hyde Park Boulevard is the main obstacle in it's way and has been judged to be too important to the city's industrial economy. We are so so close to having a great mass transit system in the Golden Horseshoe region but like everything else in this region, it is bogged down by red tape.

The most realistic way to handle it would have a commuter rail extend from Buffalo to Niagara Falls through the city's industrial North End. Open up pedestrian walking traffic on the Whirlpool bridge so that once you get off the commuter rail, you can just walk across the bridge, pass through customs and then jump on the GO train to Toronto. Use the new train station as a transit hub, with NFTA buses and the state park trolleys departing and returning there. The bus terminal on portage road already really sucks and needs to be updated and there is no central hub for tourists to get on the state park trolleys. The extra space in the train station can be used for customs processing for those coming in from Canada (and the building was originally built as a customs house!). You would just need to get some type of custom agent barriers built at the end of the NY side of the Whirlpool bridge and build up that area a little bit. I think it could also bring a lot of traffic into the new Underground railroad museum and especially on to Main street."

Also not everything needs to be a straight up forest, an ecosystem needs stuff like  meadows and parries to thrive too.

 The United States devoted way more land to agriculture and timber harvesting a hundred years ago then they do now. Even the way you dumb down forestry management practices with ""plant it, wait, cut it down"" just confuses me why you would simplify something that is super complex and involves serious management practices. There are several stages of forest growth too, from first succession, to 2nd succession, going all the way up to old growth. Looking at aerial images from your computer is in noway going to tell the whole picture about an ecosystems  health.

 For instance, the Adirondack Park in Upstate New York was nearly wiped out by clear cropping at the turn of the 20th century, but now it is the largest tract of preserved/conserved land in the lower 48.

Same thing goes for Canadian hockey players playing in the US (or even those Canadian students living in the US at the time of the first basketball games). 

But Canada totally didn't burn down the White House. I don't think there was even any Canadian residents within the regiment that carried out the act and the commander behind it was British/born in Ireland."

todayilearned,fccjdra,t1_fcci4yw,1577599071.0,Plus that video you posted literally starts with listing an American city and state.
todayilearned,fccj3lv,t1_fcci4yw,1577598978.0,"But the game wasn't first played in Canada. The only thing that makes it Canadian was that the creator was born there. All the resources and tools he used were American. America is what gave him the opportunity to create the game. Why didn't he just start playing it in Canada in the first place? 

And you are right, accepting and including foreigns as Americans is a big part of American culture (despite what the current political climate will make you think). Especially when they contribute something big to our society. Basketball was created in the United States because the creator was given the opportunity here. That is a fact. It may have been created by a a former resident and citizen of Canada, but it was created in the United States, for American students."

todayilearned,fcc938n,t1_fcb9y6y,1577595755.0,And where are all the markets for the NHL teams? Why aren't these Canadians playing in Canada and not the United States?
todayilearned,fcc8wgy,t1_fcb9bvw,1577595697.0,"Basketball was invented by a Canadian immigrant to the United States, at an American school, with American students and the inventor died a US citizen. The only connection is has with Canada is that the creator was born there."
todayilearned,fcc8g9l,t1_fcb4a5s,1577595559.0,"Hockey is pretty popular internationally,  although it can be argued that it is a Canadian sport, nearly all the NHL teams and markets are in the US. It is straight up dumb to say that sport doesn't have an international reach."

AskReddit,fc6tbtq,t1_fc6sxs3,1577488962.0,So you are angry that someone else is ashamed of their own cut dick? To the point that you are turning that anger on to another total stranger who isn't ashamed of their own shit? It is soooooo weird. What opinions are wrong? I am generally curious to know now.
