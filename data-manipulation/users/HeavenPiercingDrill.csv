SS13,fdb9zhk,t3_ekhpmr,1578255322.0,"here's a few tricks i've picked up as clown: 

\-relabel vapor to an air canister and release it in med

\-go jihad under the direction of the chaplain

\-steal the lawyer's pda cartridge to message the station about shitsec/erp stories/ tell crew the incorrect hacking wires

\-order the ai to kill all catgirls

\-hack into hop's office to get aa if they left their console logged in (then buy a shitty shuttle and send centcomm funny messages)

\-create a soda dispensor and chem dispensor in your clown room, and used advanced sanitation research to make spray bottles. fill spray bottles with spray tan lotion and overdose the crew with spraytan to turn them into Jersey-Shore characters

\-get the captain's valu-pak cartridge. hack the smoking vendors to buy all the e-cigaretts. fill them with welding fuel and leave them lying around the halls, and give one to the bartender. Alternatively, fill them with unstable mutagen

\-go into genetics and print a bunch of monkified injectors, then rename them ""godhood injector"" with a hand labeler and leave them in the main hall

\-get aa and create a new hop console. shut down all recruiting positions except for clown, so that you end up with 15 to 20 clowns on the station

\-gib ian with the cook's help and give hop the ian burger

\-hack the sec doors to be bolted when there's no ai

\-choose the grafitti perk and paint everything using the largebrush model, ususally pink. or paint big penises. work with sec and captain to paint the entire sec department and cells to be pink. or color all the lights on the station to be rainbow. kill the janitor when they interrupt

\-befriend clown ops, as you were both created under the eye of the honkmother

\-create bluespace bananas and wormhole projectors. free the prisoners in the sec department

\-donate your mask, shoes, and horn to robotics so they make a honk mech. you can get a new mask in the autodrobe

\-break into the morgue. put all dead bodies on display in the chapel with meathooks so they spread annoying diseases. justify them as sacrifices, they look good there either way

\-steal janitor's ride. pull banana or soap behind you so people running into you will push your ride back but then slip. works well

\-create pneumatic cannon in the crafting menu. shoot erp books from the library at people

\-Emag: emag the beepsky, medibots, mulebots, soda dispensor, chem dispensor, cargo order console, e cigarettes (they explode) and smoke dispensor. For the bots: once emagged put a pai/posi brain in so they can have fun, except beepsky. 

\-Hypnoflash: make someone worship the honkmother, preferably the captain once their mindshield implant is lost after they're cloned.

\-Detomax: before you send victims detomax, send them a normal honkworks virus so they will hear a honk before death

\-if there are meaty ores: get the roboticist to implant you with an alien egg sac and plasma vessel. give birth

\-Frame cartridge: frame the mime.

\-Changeling: turn everyone into the same catgirl or nonhuman with transformation sting. they can never turn back. Causes really great chaos

\-Misc tator things: activate silopocalypse grenade on the emergency shuttle, give random assistants some c4, trap command doors with an explosion holoparasite, do some hot potato on the emergency shuttle, or  clown car on emergency shuttle if you have aa. Give ai wgw laws. 

\-use some imaginiation!"
