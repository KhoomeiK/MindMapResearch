dogswithjobs,fdecf95,t1_fde9la4,1578335976.0,I just checked those out! I really dig the concept. Is the underside lined with any padding (part that makes contact with the nose)? I couldn't quite tell from the pictures. My girl doesn't have much fur on her face.
dogswithjobs,fdec8h0,t1_fdeb1di,1578335858.0,Thank you!
dogswithjobs,fde1afi,t3_ekozud,1578328922.0,What leader is that? I use the Gentle Leader on my dog but I've been looking for one with a wider strap like this one.
ACPocketCamp,fcii7wr,t3_ediunr,1577662969.0,I love this!! How did you get the crystal ball?

Is your baby a mixed breed? The face looks EXACTLY like my dog but she is definitely not corgi size! Almost 50lbs. I was told she is a Cattle Dog/Hound/Possibly Husky mix."
