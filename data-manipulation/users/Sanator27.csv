Boomer,fezmszc,t1_fezlqww,1579459113.0,"Bad teachers, who didn't give a fuck. Degree was focused mostly on human geography and social sciences, which clashed with me since I have a background mostly on natural sciences.

I can't say I had a lot of experiences really, I just felt like I was there, and like I would never have a job with that degree, especially because in my country there's little demand for planners (they're seen as a waste of money). And what little there is, well, you better have some connections to land you in a job where you stay in an office most of the time doing nothing.

Edit: also, I left that degree for Geology, and I'm much, much happier here, and I feel like I'm actually learning something"
