AskUK,ff5gyt9,t1_ff5fpoq,1579592419.0,"No. Nothings leaking. It's just normal humidity from everyday things like ironing, cooking cleaning, drying and living. It's just trapped in winter because everything is shut.

50-60% is what is ideal. In summer open windows do this. In winter it collects in the walls doors and furniture eventually collecting on windows and doors and then sometimes pooling on the sills or floors.

A dehumidifiers capacity to remove a large amount of water in a day doesn't mean it will. Especially if you set the humidity to want it to get to.

>On older releases of the film, Tim Allen made a sarcastic remark in the movie, which included the line ""1-800-SPANK-ME."" During the film's release, a woman from near Cleveland, Ohio called the supposedly-fictional number for her curious grandchildren; it turned out to be a phone sex line. However, it wasn't until 1997, when Disney received complaints from parents whose children called the number and racked up huge phone bills, did the studio take action and cut the line for future releases. Disney also said that they would purchase the phone number to disconnect the service. This part of the film is also cut in the DVD's release. On television broadcasts, the number is changed to 1-800-POUND."
