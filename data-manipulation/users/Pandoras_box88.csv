I'd be willing to pay rent. The mortgage is paid off on two of the properties. I'm 31 and have Cystic Fibrosis and BPD and I am desperate to move out again because it's a toxic environment. So, I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you."

relationship_advice,feo9sat,t3_eq24oq,1579297108.0,"I'm sorry you've just come to this realisation. It's very painful and I know how angry you're feeling right now. I was diagnosed with BPD last year and I tried to find reasons why I developed it and like you I thought I'd had a normal upbringing. After reading about emotional invalidation, gaslighting and narcissistic parents I finally realised what my parents did to me. I'd always blamed myself and believed I was a monster as my mother had always told me this. Take some time to think about things and decide if you want to talk to your parents about it. I confronted my mother and she denied it all and invalidated and gaslighted me further. She did eventually apologise though. My father takes no responsibility for how I've turned out at all. Therapists have told me family therapy would be futile and would only further invalidate me because of my father's denials. We actually had 3 years of family therapy when I was a teenager (my mother told me it was to help my parents to help me), of course now I've realised my family was dysfunctional and my parents were being shown how to properly parent me. I was always told I was the one who needed help, I was the one who was dysfunctional. I'm 31 and I only realised all of this at 30 and with years of therapy. You've realised this much younger and on your own. That is brilliant. Whether you choose no contact or not with your parents I wish you all the best. I had to move back home last year but when I move out again I will keep contact to a minimum."
OCPoetry,feo334q,t3_epj56r,1579294501.0,"Burned

Every raw nerve is exposed. Burned down until it's revealed. The slightest breeze is agony, the mildest brush past me an orgy of suffering. A harsh word the worst of all. 

Longing to be wrapped up in a womb, a cocoon of warmth and safety. To chrysalise myself. 

The earth is too painful a place, too full of mundane horrors. 

It is too tender to even wrap myself in the softest of blankets, I have no protection from the elements. I am completely naked and revealed to all. There is nowhere to hide, to conceal myself. Nowhere to seal away the shame, no little cubbyhole in my heart to shield the emotions.

I must bear it. 

I must bear it."

relationship_advice,fegi9hs,t1_fegbcw8,1579093612.0,"Sorry for not addressing that part of your post. Maybe you need to sit her down and tell her how you feel about all of this, maybe even show her this post? She has to want to work on your marriage for there to be hope of improving things."
relationship_advice,fegba3o,t3_ep0tld,1579086023.0,"I'm sorry but I don't think you're the only one with issues here, I don't mean to be hurtful but it sounds to me like your wife shows a lack of interest in you and your marriage. No wonder you're looking for attention from her, there's nothing remotely toxic about that. It's also perfectly normal to want her to do more housework and to get your child out of bed earlier in the morning. It's ok to be insecure when your wife wants to be poly and it's not for you. Nothing you've said is unreasonable. From what you've said she is the unreasonable one."
