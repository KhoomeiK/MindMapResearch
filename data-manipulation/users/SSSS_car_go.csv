Even with perfect use, these masks aren’t foolproof because a virus or pathogen can still slip through the sides or enter the body through the eyes.

>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that any health-care workers interacting with coronavirus patients or suspected cases wear a stronger kind of mask, known as the N95 respirator, along with other precautions like gloves and eye protectors. The N95 filters out 95% of pollutants and is “highly effective” in preventing the transmission of viruses, said Sexton. However, these masks must be specially fitted and therefore aren’t commonly worn outside of the health care setting.

It’s possible that the reader is not in the right frame of mind to read a slow book, but that can be rectified by closing it and coming back at a later time, either when we’re feeling more thoughtful or when we’re more mature. Two examples off the top of my head are *Oblamov*, an 1859 novel by Ivan Alexandrovich Goncharov, and Thoreau’s *Walden*.

I read *Oblamov* in school in a Russian lit class, and normally wouldn’t have picked it up. It’s a very long novel about a man who doesn’t get out of bed, and is what would appear in the dictionary to define “slow plot.” But even though it’s slow, it’s deep and riveting. From the wiki article on Goncharov, “For the first time one single feature, that of social apathy, a self-destructive kind of laziness and unwillingness to even try and lift the burden of all-pervading inertia, had been brought to the fore and subjected to a thorough analysis.”

*Walden* is glacial but fascinating. Maybe it’s more of an iceberg than a glacier, actually, with so much going on under the surface. I could read it 100 times and still be getting more out of it.

>~ Stay at least 50 yards away.  If the seal reacts to your presence, you’re too close.

>~ Ask other people to stay away, and keep dogs at a safe distance.

>~ Observe the animal from a distance, note it’s size, weight, markings, body condition, and whether or not there are any wounds.  If you have a camera or camera phone, take a photo.

>~ Note your location and any significant landmarks nearby.

>~ Call the authorized stranding network organization.  It is illegal – and dangerous – for untrained people to get too close to seals.  On Cape Cod, call the IFAW Marine Mammal Rescue Hotline at (508) 743-9548.  Elsewhere, check out this map from NOAA to find the authorized respondent in your area.  If you can’t find the number, call your local animal control or police department; they will have the number of folks who can help.

>~ Follow the stranding network personnel’s instructions.

>Remember that seals periodically come out of the water to rest on the beach.  This is normal and, in fact, necessary for seals.  Unless an animal is clearly in distress, most stranding networks prefer to leave an animal on the beach for at least an overnight in order to see if the animal will leave on its own."

Do you get paid by check with pay stubs, or are they paying you cash under the table? I just don't see how they can be following the letter of the law with regard to taxes while they are underpaying you. Wouldn't your wage be part of what they report along with submitting quarterly taxes on your behalf? 

It's pretty reprehensible that they would do that, even if they are very nice people. The reason there is a minimum wage is because it's considered to be the *minimum* amount a person needs to survive in a community. Whether you choose to report this to some authority or not, I urge you to not accept being paid less than is legally required, and not accept being paid off the books (if that is the case)."

The ones from the drug store that you have to mold yourself with hot water are OK, but not as firm or as durable or as well configured to my jaw as are the ones the dentist makes. Also, my bite is so strong I could bite off small pieces in my sleep, which is not good (choking hazard).

The DDS ones cost more ($300 most recently) and last for years, and the drug store ones ($25?) last 6 months or so. You can always try the OTC ones to see if they help, and get a DDS one eventually.

The thing is that grinding without a bite guard can crack a tooth! I did that twice, and each one needed a root canal and a crown, for about $1,500 each, iirc."

The cost of a move itself can be very expensive, even if you don’t bring furniture. There are so many details to address, and I’d recommend you do it in stages. (1) Get some interviews for jobs lined up. (2) Come here for a week for your interviews, and use the time to explore housing possibilities.

Not a podiatrist, but some other training, and he knows feet. The first time going there it took about an hour for him to evaluate my walk stride, my weight, how I use shoes, etc. The shoe that he pulls for me (he goes in the back to get them. It’s not about fashion, but comfort) are Brooks. They are about $120, or a bit less when I buy the previous year’s model.

So if you can find a Comfort Shoes or similar with a foot expert near you, that’s what I’d recommend. There’s just too much riding on what you put between you and the earth."

Different universities that offer tuition benefits have different rules, and rules change over time. When I wanted my master’s I checked with several local universities and picked the one that gave tuition immediately on employment; others wanted me to work for a year first. (This was in Washington DC, and they are top universities.) I was able to take almost a full load in night and weekend classes, and finished my degree in two years and a few months. My sister worked at the same university and did all three of her degrees—BA, MA, and PhD—for free. Toward the end the rules changed slightly and she had to pay taxes on the benefits as income, but that was minimal. My job was clerical and very low level, which is what I wanted.

The personnel office was not disturbed at all when I told them why I wanted to work there, and said about a third of the employees were there for benefits for them or their children."
