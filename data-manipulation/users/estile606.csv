Gotta make myself omniscient with divine power, but first it probably makes sense to redesign my thought process to take zero time and be perfectly logical. Need to pin down and decide on what exactly my goals and moral beliefs are as well, so as to know what end goal to put that logic to. Probably a good idea to tone down or remove my sense of emotion to avoid potentially dangerous emotional decision making."

geckos,ffguxu0,t3_etjlm5,1579915707.0,"r/leopardgeckos has a nice care guide. Theres several good sources out there, but dont trust anything that claims you can house multiple of them together, or which claims they live on sand.

In general, they eat insects, dusted with calcium, calcium with D3 (or you can use a uvb light in place of d3, just dont do both), and occationally multivitamin.

Ive generally seen a 20g long aquarium listed as a minimum size, be sure whatever type of terrarium or aquarium you use is wide rather than tall, as leopard geckos arent the sort of gecko to climb a lot.

There are a few ways to heat them, for instance some people use deep heat projectors, but the most common way seems to be heat mats. To set one up this way, get a heat mat big enough to cover 1/3 or so of the floor space and have it to one side so that half the tank is warmer than the other. You will need a thermostat as heat pads are basically just uncontrolled heating elements on their own. The thermostat should be set so as to keep the warm end of the tank around 90f. To check the temperature of an area, use a laser thermometer, not one of the ones that measures air temperature. Ground temperature is what matters.

Lights may not be necessary, unless you have the tank somewhere where you need them to create a clear day/night cycle. You can also use uvb lights instead of d3 suppliments as mentioned before. Do not use the colored heat lamps some pet stores will try to sell you, they can harm the gecko's eyes.

Substrate can be something soft like eco-earth, or solid like tile, I use paper towels for mine. Its not the prettiest looking but it works ok and is very easy to clean. Do not use sand, calci-sand, wood chips,crushed walnut shells, ect, the only loose substrates acceptable are things like eco-earth which are digestible.

In addition to the points you asked about it is important that they have a number of hiding spots in different areas of the tank, and that one of those spots be kept humid. They will need that humid spot to shed their skin properly.

Also note that they are absolutely not social animals and more than one should not be housed in the same tank."

That being said, I can understand why they exist, I remember vividly some neighbors I had when I was in elementary school who decided to never walk their pitbulls, and who instead had them poop in a kiddie pool in their apartment, which they left behind when they moved. I know of this because flies got in, and bred to such numbers that enough got through the laundry vents into my family's apartment that we had to literally vacuum them off everything. They had to entirely gut the neighboring unit and redo everything. The majority of pet owners are reasonable, but I imagine there is a need to recoup costs spent on rare massive repairs like that, which I doubt the landlord was able to get from those renters (I have no idea if any lawsuits were filed over that, I was a kid at the time after all, but given that the apartment was fairly low end I doubt the people responsible would have had the money to pay for it even if forced to.)"

As far as generation ships go though, I would argue that if you are colonizing another solar system that way, it doesn't much matter how hard the planets would be to terraform. Having a generation ship at all implies you can build a spacecraft capable of housing a large number of people comfortably pretty much indefinitely, especially if you are willing to maintain and replace aging components. If one simply uses available materials from, say, asteriods and comets to build more such craft (and they can be far cheaper than the original ship as they wont need an interstellar propulsion system) any system could be colonized regardless of how earthlike its planets are. Further, you get far more living area for a given mass with spinning cylinders than with planets, so it makes sense to not bother terraforming planets at all. Instead, dismantle them for resources to build up a dyson swarm of artificial habitats with."

AskReddit,fehhbdf,t3_ep36xi,1579116531.0,"I do not believe that time works in quite the linear way we percieve it to. Rather, I believe that it is more like any space dimension, and that all points in time for a given point in space ""already"" (hard to find the right word given that words applying to time tend to assume linearity) exist, just at different points along the time axis. I cannot really prove this, but in support I offer that as intelligence requires information processing, which requires movement (of electrical impulses ect), which only seems to happen when the space positions of an object are different for different points in time, any intelligent system is going to *perceive* time as moving, even if in reality it is not. Therefore, our perception of time as flowing in one direction does not imply that time must actually be doing that. Second, the other dimensions we encounter, ie space dimensions, do not ""flow"" the way time seems to. It would seem better to assume that time is not exceptional in this, by occams razor.

There are a few other things that I believe as a consequence of this: for one thing, the sum total of existence, ie the universe and anything outside of it, to include time and any higher dimensions that could be used in a similar fashion to time, *cannot* have been created by anyone or anything, because creation is itself a thing implying change, which is reliant on time. If you could look upon every point in every dimension simultaneously somehow, everything would have to be entirely static.

Another thing influenced by this is my conception of morality and justice. If time is ""static"", then the universe *must* be deterministic, in other words, people cannot actually control their own thoughts and actions. I support efforts to change behavior I find harmful, like that of a murderer or theif, because I am a member of a species that evolved to dislike that behavior, and so have no choice but to want to prevent that behavior, through means like rehabilitation or imprisonment, but I dont believe that anybody *deserves* to be punished, rather I simply want them to be to prevent their crime. If it can be assured somehow that a criminal definitely will not reoffend, I see no reason to keep them imprisoned even if the scale of their punishment seems far less harsh than what was done to the victim. I dont believe that *deserve* is something that truly exists at all, it is merely something we tell ourselves to because we feel we must rationalize reward and punishment.
