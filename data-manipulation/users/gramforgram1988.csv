Power was shut off and that seemed to be the last straw. I'm terrified of having to rebuild my life from scratch alone. No friends or family in town but I'll stay to be close to my kids. Ending it all would be too easy and I don't think of myself as an optimist but I keep my chin up and push one foot in front of the other. I hope you find what little strength I have left in me inspiring. You still have a loving wife, I envy you."

SuicideWatch,fevbx65,t3_eqn8q0,1579395568.0,Somewhere I read that PTSD is caused by the blame we take upon ourselves. No matter what happened it was not your fault. You might night be strong but drum up the courage to forgive yourself even though you did nothing wrong
