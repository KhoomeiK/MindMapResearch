Hmm, it's sounds like you're not exactly ignoring the emotions rather bottling them, if they come out later in yelling. Food for thought.
Communicating your emotions can be hard, I'm 10 years older than you and still don't do it well always. BUT. BUT. HOWEVER. You can communicate them to yourself as the first step. Sounds kinda dumb but pls try it out. Talk it through in your own head the way you might to a stranger or your mom or a therapist. It's like math (are you good in math class?) The number one most important thing to do is write down what you already know, THEN, work out which formula to use. All the kids that struggled with math I knew read the question then picked a formula and it didn't go well. Read the question, write down what you know, then next step. 
You feel your emotions, and you maybe know one reason why. Speak that out, or even write it down, to yourself. It'll lead you to the second reason and the third, and a secondary emotion with its reasons. It's something worth trying- I used to be so poorly with my emotions I wondered if I was a sociopath or Asperger's or *something*

Edit: as an example, a distressing drama happened with a friend, and I turned the events over and over in my mind for like 2months until one day I used a *slightly* different word in my internal monologue discribing the events which shifted my perspective a smidge which led me to actually dealing with and moving past the event.

It was along the lines of I felt like I had to protect someone, and didn't. And I kept thinking like that, then one day I said I should have been there if she needed me. And boom. It's not my place to protect her. She was independent and could handle herself. I should be there for support but I was infantilising her ability to handle her emotions with my 'must protect' weird ego trip. Simply thinking about my emotions enough time that I used a different word is what let me process it."

You're only young, you're not just gonna magically know all the ways to behave because you've decided you want to. Life is a process. Start with the easy stuff, tell your mum you want to be a more equal member of the household, not a child she must supervise. Youre gonna start doing jobs around the house like you have, it'll become habit. Ask her to tell you every dinnertime all the things she did today that keeps your world turning: because so much of what she does is invisible, so you can't know how to help if you don't know the task exists to begin with. 

You're not gonna get a to do list of 100 traits off reddit, but the fact you're being introspective is a fantastic start. Maybe look up books on empathy?

As an easy example. Definitely research into finding a good practitioner if American, cause as I said, I don't think the term is regulated over there.

A common issue I have is tight shoulders, which are tight because they are the counter balance to sort of your ab muscles in a way. And when I get stressed the abs tense up and stay tense. They don't hurt, but because the shoulders are working over time compensating for the abs pulling me forwards the shoulders hurt.

I would say simple first step to making permanent change; do it in small steps
 DO NOT under any circumstances change your entire diet and lifestyle in one hit. Yeah sure it works for some people, but it's pretty difficult.

One- do you drink soda multiple times a day? If so, find ONE of those sodas to replace with a glass of water. Not all soda at once.
Two- make or buy EXACTLY the same foods you do now. Exactly. Change nothing. All I want you to do is to throw out a portion of the food rather than eat it. This might sound like a waste of money, buts it's money you already spend, we're simply sending some calories into the bin rather than in to you.

If you eat a whole pizza, throw one slice out. If you buy a mars bar, leave the last bite in the wrapper, if you buy a hot pocket leave the last two bites etc       or maybe rip/bite bits off and throw them out before you eat the item if you don't like leaving a morsel in your hand at the end, whatever works for you.

Three- this changing of your lifestyle and habits is majorly mental, so the simple changes above are really good practice at making better choices without being majorly complicated. 
Continue them by now switching a second daily soda with water, maybe now don't buy that snack rather than buy it and throw half out. For meals you make start throwing away larger portions
Eventually you can start buying less snacks overall and cooking smaller meals of the same foods. By this point you may find it beneficial to start changing WHAT you eat, as you'll be eating less volume and even though it's enough calories you might feel hungry. That's where switching to healthier food that has more volume per calorie will be useful.
