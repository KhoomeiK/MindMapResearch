I hope you will enjoy the game too if you plan on getting it :)"
Games,ffhot9v,t1_fffo16w,1579945915.0,"My very first playthrough tried to include all side-quests but going very fast, as initially I had little time available to play the game during those weeks. I grinded a lot in Black Holes and on enhancing characteristics, which made some battles much more quicker and easy, but that was done by me on the above pretense that I would not have enough time otherwise to enjoy the challenge. I clocked about 21 hours and 50 minutes on my first save.
From there I replayed from a past save which was ahead of the beginning, and knowing what to do and grinding again clocked another 11 hours. Last I did the final ending by starting from the beginning of the game, and clocked in another 10 hours. I would say that you might be very good and skilled without need to grind at all, so I suggest to keep the length of the game between 20 hours for the first ending and 40 hours to obtain them all."

JRPG,ffex407,t3_et8zhf,1579869051.0,"Last game I finished was **Virgo versus the Zodiac**, and honestly I'm glad I stumbled upon this little gem. As someone passionate about deeper games and games with something special in them (Like Nier, Drakengard, Celeste, Va-11 Hall-A for example), this game was a small yet big surprise. I think I played for a total of 45 hours to discover all the endings, and that was after I grinded a lot to try and overlevel, so the game might last longer for people who simply go through it without trying to overdo their power like I did.   
With that said, everything from the lore to the world-building to the fights themselves is simply engaging and well developed. This is one of those games that leaves post-game depression once you realize that no many similar games are out there.

I don't know if it can be considered a game per se, but I'm currently playing **VRChat** often with my friends. I find the possibilities of the 'game' really nifty: you can watch movies, you can do activities, you get help with social anxiety by being surrounded by people (maybe more by anime titties and weird avatars but it's not always the case), and it can be a great help for people being homestuck and desiring to explore more of the world or feel next to other people. Honestly I have been enjoying it a lot, and with the introductions of headsets that properly track fingers, the deaf community could also properly join the game and assist bullied people and others experiencing difficulties in creating friendships, and I find that beautiful.

I started to replay **Alice: Madness Return** as I discovered an Italian dub was out there and I never got to try it. The translation is really well done, which makes me happy, but what makes me even more happy is that I discovered McGee wants to make another sequel, Asylum. I hope he manages to do it, because the kind of 'horror' and atmosphere that his games have is very special and always a pleasure to experience."

IndieGaming,ffesfol,t3_eeslku,1579863315.0,"I didn't have the chance to try many indie games, so it's lovely to find a thread listing the best ones and helping with finding out what I missed. Mine are:

\- Baba is You: such a lovely game, it contains that nice cleverness that is typical of games like Monkey Island, where you have to do things that seem apparently illogical but then actually click together and end up being reasonable. The puzzles are clever and the design is superb. The only ominous and dire part is when you mistakenly learn what happens if you don't have anything related to the YOU part. Thank God for the Undo button.

\- Untitled Goose Game: one of the most funny and relaxing experience ever, although it manages to make one go to great extents to try and be as annoying as possible. I'm grateful for all the memes and the fun it generated.

\- Virgo versus the Zodiac: honestly a big big surprise to end the year. I had returned to my parents' home and my old computer was struggling with staying alive. Instead of focusing on FFXIV, I decided to try this small game which seemed to have an interesting concept (the zodiac  sign Virgo fighting other zodiac signs). I could't expect what I ended up into: there are multiple endings, a lot of replayability, the dialogues are all funny and make one want to try and read every description. The combat system is pretty nifty and it allows one to stay focused and partecipate more actively into the fight, in spite of it being a turn-based game. But what I love the most is the plot, the characterization of the protagonists and essentially everyone in the game. There are tiny bits of lore regarding the past and current world who really build up nicely and make you even have a sort of fridge brilliance about certain things. Honestly a big big surprise, putting it right there with Celeste and Nier: Automata, especially because there is a lot of grimdark depending on how you decide to proceed toward uncovering the truth."
TrueOffMyChest,ffepygq,t3_et5f4s,1579859634.0,"I wouldn't say one is just a normal ass person by being demisexual: when there must be a strong bond it means that it takes for some people *a lot* of time to be able to form that bond. Demisexual people are also less sexually active or desiring sex, according to certain studies.

As for it being an orientation, it's difficult to say. Maybe it could be an orientation if one would get to form a bond and be sexual with whoever the bond is made with, no matter whether it's same sex or not (aka uncaring of being straight, gay and so on). On the matter of orientation I would say, if being asexual is an orientation, demisexuality probably manages to fit in.

I do understand how it seems to be just something minor compared to being lesbian, gay, trans and so on, but whether it should be considered an orientation, I can assure you that being demisexual is absolutely not equivalent to being a normal ass person. A normal ass person often seeks someone because they are attracted to something from that person, and puts efforts into knowing them better. Demisexuals often don't even seek partners, and let things just go by no matter the situation. The label in LGBT wouldn't have been there at all if it were considered normal in the first place."

In all seriousness, trust me when I say this: you should leave her. She wants you to do her bidding no matter what, and that means simply creating spawns and teaching them the word of the lord without really respecting anything related to you aside from your own capacity to impregnate her. In fact I wouldn't be too surprised if it turned out she doesn't really love you/is not a devout, and just wants a certain type of family and financial stability.

You love your kids but your kids need to know as well how fucked up the situation is, because they will learn sooner or later, through your behaviour, her own, through certain type of words and events that you won't be able to control. Reject sex completely for her, masturbate at work or anywhere far away from the house and undiscoverable, and don't give her anything anymore. Lower the money allowance, make her go crazy, make the kids see how much she can be manipulative, and take the kids away with you. You seem a decent person and maybe too compliant with her, but leaving her won't mean you will leave the kids. Mention that you tried to do counseling but she does nothing besides taking your money and your mental health away."

Cultural appropriation is a tricky issue, but what matters ultimately is supporting the people of that culture and spreading awareness about that culture's beauty. What is really culture appropriation is people thinking some things belong or are property of just *their* own culture: dreads for example existed in many civilizations, but it's common to see people criticizing whites for having them, even if cultures like Vikings and Celts had them already.

If you don't mind my suggestion though, that woman was probably bitter about other things. If you ever come back there I would try to strike a conversation with her, making her understand that you want your child to know of its culture, and that it can be a good think to let other know about a dying or abused population rather than being overprotective of the culture itself. Maybe it can be a chance for a good friendship."

AskMen,fdmwou7,t3_elwlva,1578569253.0,"I had a few experiences which should give me some self-esteem but only contributed to destroy it:

1 - Some classmates trying to hurt me specifically down there while we were doing p.e., and then burned my hair because they were long and weren't supposed to be for a male

2 - A doctress at a hospital who was examining my leg where I was badly hurt and put my hand on my crotch for a few seconds

3 - A girl in a crowded bus (both standing) who kept leaning against me and tried to fondle me for almost the entire trip. Toward the end of the trip the guy in front of her seemed to notice and pulled her next to him by force, with her hugging him afterwards. It made me think it happened often and the guy was the boyfriend.

4 - I have had some stalkers in my life, who would write things on the car of my parents, call home at night because I wasn't replying to cellphone calls as my cellphone was turned off when sleeping, following me around, follow me at work once discovering where I work, and bothering during work times, constantly asking to go out or trying to spend time together."
pics,fdmvnn3,t3_em2qy3,1578567950.0,"There is something I want to share here, as I wonder if anyone else ever stumbled on the same: many years ago (we're talking between 2008 and 2010 if memory serves) I had stumbled more and more into some conspiracy sites thanks to my ex. I dismissed most of them except for few ones which seemed to gather all evidence provided about 9/11, aliens and so on and dismiss the fake ones while recognizing which ones were deemed uncertain, so it seemed to have a bit more of criteria. One day they linked an article on another website, the story of a mother and a daughter who were held in the white House as sex slaves: the daughter was raised since childhood to become a sexual slave, and the mother was also in the same situation since way before obviously. I don't remember now if there was the implication that they were kidnapped and she was already pregnant with her daughter, or her daughter was born due to intercourse with someone from there. I remember the account written saw the daughter (who had supposedly escaped and told everyone of what was going on but wasn't believed) meeting one night past presidents in charge, among which Bush and Clinton were there. They came inside the room naked, almost fully drunk, and were asking to put away other girls and prepare her and the mother for the usual stuff. This experience had left a mark on the girl and she didn't want to be identified, fearing for her life.

I had mostly forgotten and thought of it again from time to time during the year, but the very first thought I had when I heard of Weinstein went to this article, and it was further so when the case of Epstein came out, along the mention of very important names. I never managed to find the article back, and frankly had not looked much to find it back, but I couldn't help wondering whether that account was more true than false after these events."

I'm totally on your side with this, you need to give someone the possibility to earn and understand that good work can pay off, not continue to leave them without money after accumulating a debt. This goes for the US (where I don't live) and the rest of the world."

As for your family, I think it's important to wait and watch, probably your mother telling you that about your father might have some truth (as in possible destructive depression effect, especially now after all that time), but at the end of the day this family member needs to pay, that's all that matter. You have your boyfriend, you need to make your own new life, and they will need to understand that not having believed you was the wrong move to do, especially your mother. You might want to testify against this now, telling everything that happened, but be prepared about what reaction your family might have, whether supportive or against you, as that might give you further pain.

Focus on yourself first now, you were put in a situation that made it difficult to press charges or talk more about this. As important as it is to ensure that victims can feel comfortable with speaking out and criminals get to pay for what they've done, at the time he might not have been stopped either, and you wouldn't have changed what he did now. It's all on him, not you, he is the criminal in this situation, nothing that happened to you was your own fault."

What kind of parent would want their child restrained and forced to watch others laugh at his suffering? I hope therapy helps the child detach and become stronger to face the parents, because that's what he really needs with such a worrisome situation to live in."
TrueOffMyChest,fd5r101,t3_ek2dg2,1578180519.0,"Very very sorry you have to go through such horrible things, but I'm also glad that you seem like a strong person, and I'm glad you find further strength through games. I myself have bought components for a new gaming pc, as videogames have been a major interest of mine since when I was kid, accompanying me through many difficult moments, and somewhat still helping as best as they can. If you don't mind me giving a suggestion, you might be interested in trying VR, along VRChat, which some people use for social anxiety, going places where they can not normally go (as in mean of traveling), trying out new experiences, or even simply socialize. I know of Oculus Quest and Oculus Rift S having inside-out tracking, which means you wouldn't need to have special trackers installed, but maybe it's better to check around for reviews and other opinions around reddit to find out more. I myself would like to have either the Index or Rift S now that my new components arrived."

In my native country it was illegal for them to be on the street, while where I live now they are right next to the main plaza. Every time I have to go groceries and end up seeing them I genuinely can't help wondering if they're there of their own will or not. On one hand there should be constant checks and ensure no one is mistreated, on the other hands, situation like yours unfortunately keep happening.

This is genuinely horrible, I couldn't believe what I was reading, even though I had heard similar stories already. I'm glad though that things are better for you now. I was curious about knowing which country you ended up being deported to, if you don't mind me asking. Was also wondering if those criminals were originally from Germany, the country you were deported to, or another one? And is there any way one could notice whether someone is being exploited and trafficked? Is there any advice that could maybe save or prevent others from falling into the same trap, besides being cautious about modeling/dancing gigs like these?

AmItheAsshole,fd29by2,t3_ejkij2,1578143719.0,"I think it's kind of tricky, I wouldn't want anything to happen to me or someone I care for under anesthesia without any consent or being informed pre-emptively even if necessary, but there is limited time to operate under anesthesia as well. The thing that truly gives troubles to them is that he himself mentioned that it was not included in the puppy care package, so I think at least one technician or another assistant, unless understaffed, could have maybe give notice and ask for permission. In their defense, they did immediately discount it and admitted they didn't consult you, so they seem reliable both medically and as human beings.

I kind of feel there are NAH, because maybe the VT was different in other visits, or the teeth were not simply checked or detected, but I speak only from hypothesis of course. Still, what matters is that the puppy is safe and sound, and you created a precedent to ensure that in the future they do notify people, either beforehand if they know already, or before applying procedure, mentioning that there might be possibility for extra procedures. Unless they were trying to scam you 20$ with that 250$ talk I would say it's a good deal. Do read the package provided though, it might mention that further procedures could be implemented if deemed necessary."

It's genuinely better to go around and talk profusely for a while, even online afterwards, but most people have gotten used to stay detached in real life."
coolguides,fcujzrj,t3_eix9aw,1577982742.0,"I like this a lot, informative and should be more widespread.

AskReddit,fcuiq9v,t3_eixc75,1577981908.0,"I believe in long distance relationships, online dating, and trying to be with people that are the right ones for you instead of settling for someone closer that you don't feel the same for. Unfortunately, while having lovely experiences, I also had lot of suffering and exploitation, which left me very apathetic. I still find I like more people that are far away compared to those I meet in real life, with whom I have nothing in common and rarely click. But I read around the internet, even here on reddit, lovely and heartwarming stories of people that have managed to come closer in spite of the distances. What matters is when both put the same efforts into building something stable, and no, one person doing the work for both is never really going to work.

The main obstacle for me now is that I can't really find people to talk with or interact with, and I'm tired of Tinder and Bumble: it works a lot when I go back to my country, when I travel, I meet people I stay very good friends with. But in my city I find so much emptiness and flakiness that it makes me think it's not worth ever again to try to be with someone else, until the loneliness hits again later on."
