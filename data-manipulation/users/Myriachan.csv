Showerthoughts,fgi6n82,t1_fgi52hv,1580808293.0,"The difference is perspective.  You can also interpret cancer as a new form of primitive parasitic life.  It grows because it has evolutionary advantages over its neighbors: they reproduce out of control and don’t obey the suicide commands from the host DNA.

One reason relapses occur with cancer is because the cancer evolves through natural selection to be resistant to chemotherapy, just like bacteria and antibiotic resistance.

I am not a biologist, though, so don’t take my word as gospel."
