AskReddit,fgxsu69,t3_f0gbdq,1581176341.0,"Probably the drop bear. It looks like a cute koala, but that's deceptive. It wants blood."
AskReddit,fgxqirx,t3_ezyz1f,1581175672.0,That would be a hoot to watch.
AskReddit,fgxqdyl,t3_f047s3,1581175626.0,I've always kind of wondered who the first person to drink another animal's milk was and what TF that person was thinking...
AskReddit,fgtgwpx,t3_f0dq99,1581104337.0,"Let's be real, it's revenge for that time the United States tried (and failed) to invade Canada."
AskReddit,fgpv7np,t1_fgo88eo,1581012648.0,Ugh. I suppose I should be glad I'm not the only one who is often disgusted with the sort of slime that federal level elected offices tend to attract. Stuff like this is why I'm for better organization of disaster response on a local level.
AskReddit,fgo4ivd,t3_ezdu1o,1580959598.0,I remember when doing research for a school paper meant pulling books off the school library shelves. Now you can find most things through Google if you're willing to spend some time determining what a reliable source even is.
AskReddit,fgo4e4b,t3_ezjdbm,1580959509.0,"Not too hot, not too cold, and I must have my comforter."
AskReddit,fgntfbn,t3_ez8qgs,1580952516.0,"It is true that we have a lot of obese, questionably educated people who live in trailer parks. I mean, it's not all of us, but there are enough to get Trump elected into office. (Sorry about him, world; most of us hate him too.)"

AskReddit,fgnt8u7,t3_ez8prl,1580952405.0,"I would probably make it so people can't have children until they've been making an income that would make it possible for them to support a family for at least five years. I mean, I know that ""oops"" happens, but I get sick of hearing about people having 5+ kids when they're on welfare."
AskReddit,fgnszkq,t3_eyus0a,1580952245.0,They're always on their phone. It says they're probably bored and a second date would be a waste of time.

AskReddit,fglrzv7,t3_eyvdtq,1580909451.0,"I hate it. In fact, I've never met an autistic person who was thrilled with those guys. It's like they'd prefer that all of us autistic people be dead. I also feel sorry for their kids."

TwoXChromosomes,fghbq7z,t1_fggeu0y,1580781273.0,"One-party consent makes more sense from a real world standpoint anyway. If you are in a public place, you should always assume that you are being recorded in some fashion by someone."

AskReddit,fgboqr3,t3_exngaf,1580664422.0,"It was some kind of casserole with spinach in it. It was so bad that I couldn't finish it and I can usually gag down most foods even if I hate them. Just because it technically has healthy ingredients doesn't mean it's edible, folks."
AskReddit,fgboa2v,t3_exnqlr,1580664317.0,Probably mine would be called the Followers of Garamus. We don't really do a whole lot except plant fruit trees along jogging and biking pathways so people can take the fruit if they want and be good to people and animals who have run into some bad luck through no fault of their own.
AskReddit,fgbnphi,t3_exmol6,1580664103.0,My cat destroyed a little ceramic angel somebody had given me as a gift. I was more mad that he destroyed something that somebody spent $10 on to give me than I was about losing the angel.

AskReddit,fg83ru4,t3_excjau,1580608753.0,"I remember being bad at algebra in high school. Though now that I've gotten a B in college level Algebra, I suspect that the high school math teacher just wasn't that great."
AskReddit,fg83khh,t3_exf406,1580608597.0,Maybe he wised up after the first couple of times and started wearing stretchy pants?
AskReddit,fg83dn2,t3_exfdku,1580608451.0,"Listen, a lot of schools are increasingly moving their curriculum online. So you have to be prepared for the idea that your teenager will actually do *worse* in school if you basically take away their ability to do their homework and study."
AskReddit,fg8332m,t3_exckne,1580608223.0,"Moby Dick is excellent. You want a realistic depiction of what it was like to work on a whaling ship, there you go, and it's also a good take on how the desire for revenge can destroy not only the one seeking it, but also everyone who follows him."
AskReddit,fg7oywi,t3_ex9008,1580597843.0,I volunteered at a library for a while. A lot of it was helping with the children's story hour. It was fun. Mostly just crafts.

AskReddit,fg7ln17,t3_exbcj3,1580595518.0,It's a spectrum that can range from coming off as introverted but able to (mostly) live normal lives to barely being able to communicate or function independently. Our idea of being social might be a really good session of Dungeons and Dragons instead of going to parties and/or getting drunk. And we hate those anti-vaxxers who think it's better to die of polio than live as an autistic person.
LifeProTips,fg7fj18,t3_ewyfhy,1580591262.0,"There are some parts of Reddit that make fun of this phenomenon. According to Reddit, if someone starts out as, ""Well, as a parent..."" you just know that they are about to say something dumb."

AskReddit,fg6dznl,t3_ewvkv2,1580565136.0,Sometimes people underestimate what can happen when they mix alcohol with certain drugs. I've heard of at least one flight that basically had to have medics waiting at the terminal when it landed because somebody mixed Xanax with a double.

AskReddit,ffv2sud,t1_ffuq0gb,1580254363.0,You will notice that I didn't say what kind of shape that canoe had to be in. Why burn a canoe in pristine condition if you don't have to?
AskReddit,ffu66rk,t1_fftgsoc,1580235331.0,"I'd be pretty chill with being buried in a mass grave somewhere, myself. Or, hell, just do what the Vikings used to do and send me off in a burning boat if you need to put on a show about it. You can do that for the cost of a cheap canoe and a burning arrow."
AskReddit,ffu5itd,t1_fftn2jk,1580234933.0,"I hate that one too. Listen, just because you've read a book by some guy with the same name as a Star Trek character doesn't mean you're an expert on life and child-rearing, Karen."
AskReddit,ffu5daj,t1_fftp0ln,1580234840.0,I'm fairly sure that was invented by swimming pool employees who hated having to close the pool and clean things up after somebody puked in the pool.
AskReddit,fftemeq,t3_euxrty,1580218310.0,Shrek always felt to me like an R-rated movie that got remade for kids.

AskReddit,ffs1ice,t3_eus3ak,1580170852.0,"You aren't owed anything just by being alive and breathing. The world doesn't want to hear your excuses for why your life sucks. If you want to be something other than a welfare rat your whole life, then you have to earn it."
AskReddit,ffs14tr,t3_euv4zi,1580170597.0,Those guys who creep on women in public places. A few times of getting humiliated in public by the local minor hero will probably cause a lot of them to quit.
AskReddit,ffs10uc,t3_eutzdq,1580170522.0,Don't worry about it if you don't want to choose a college major right away. You can do just as well to work as a garbage man for a year or just get all the usual electives out of the way at your local community college while you figure out what you want to do with the rest of your life.
AskReddit,ffs0rcj,t3_eut4me,1580170341.0,Simply be able to stand on your own two feet. Have interests and friends outside of the relationship. Remember that one text to ask how they're doing is enough and they'll get back to you when they have a free moment and them not getting back to you right away does NOT necessarily mean that they're dying in a ditch by the side of the road after a bad car accident. (Especially true if you already know that they're at work or doing something with friends.)
AskReddit,ffs05x6,t3_eurn0i,1580169928.0,Don't worry too much about making a mistake. It'll be fine as long as you can demonstrate the mature way to handle making a mistake by owning up to it and attempting to make it right.
AskReddit,ffrzhxm,t3_euruq7,1580169473.0,"I guess it depends on whether I actually smell smoke or not. If I do, I run."

AskReddit,ffp06wj,t3_euawng,1580083900.0,"I have a tendency to judge people by how they treat kids, pets, and the front line workers in retail and restaurant establishments. If somebody treats them like shit, then that's an instant turnoff for me."

AskReddit,ffistfz,t3_etv1ml,1579981833.0,"Eventually we will have to lose the idea that the definition of ""human"" is limited to the fragile meatbags that we currently are. We'll have to get used to the idea that cyborgs and even fully capable humaniform androids can be ""human"" too."

Sometimes just not running it and getting a good breeze going in your home on the days when the temperature is pleasant outside can help.

Another thing you should think about: Whether you want to spend the money now, or later. Fix that leaky window and cranky washing machine or pay more in electric bills? Buy the good mattress or pay to have your back fixed? Because ignoring a problem because you don't want to pay the money isn't going to make it go away."
