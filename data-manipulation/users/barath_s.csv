Difficult to say therefore that he will remain good and consistent. 

If his results remain good and his technique has been ironed out and not change to try to master any one format or kind of bowling or batting aggressiveness, you can say it. KL faces different potential challenges - as an opener in difficult Tests versus as a middle order bat in T20 or ODI and may very well wind up changing technique again. ie He doesn't have a set slot or format, and is thus likely to face different demands and may tweak technique again. Opening/#3 is a tough order for a wicketkeeper-batsman to sustain, especially if the team has to rely substantially on the top order.

At the moment it is too early to say. The best chance is if India finds a slot and defined role for him, and ensures that there is a alternate keeper in one or more formats so that the load is not too much.

When they baptize them they show them nothing of Christian doctrine or life, but only subject them to popishness and mockery...If the apostles, who also were Jews, had dealt with us Gentiles as we Gentiles deal with the Jews, there would never have been a Christian among the Gentiles ... When we are inclined to boast of our position [as Christians] we should remember that we are but Gentiles, while the Jews are of the lineage of Christ. We are aliens and in-laws; they are blood relatives, cousins, and brothers of our Lord. Therefore, if one is to boast of flesh and blood the Jews are actually nearer to Christ than we are...If we really want to help them, we must be guided in our dealings with them not by papal law but by the law of Christian love. We must receive them cordially, and permit them to trade and work with us, that they may have occasion and opportunity to associate with us, hear our Christian teaching, and witness our Christian life.

High altitude sickness is a latent risk on mount everest even when you reduce some of the causative factors via acclimitiaztion etc. It is not necessarily one with astounding errors of judgement.
