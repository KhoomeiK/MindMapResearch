LGBTeens,fgt6mt1,t3_f0el9d,1581100141.0,"Hey! Please refer to rule #13 and see below for more information! 

Unfortunately we strictly don't allow memes on the subreddit anymore (and at moderator discrection we usually remove other low effort images ""Ex: Check out this gay thing/This minecraft thing I did, ETC"") as we have noticed over time with no enforcement of this policy the subreddit it quickly moves away from the intended place of advice and discussion towards more of a /r/dankmemes meme filled subreddit which is fine for a subreddit that is intended for that kind of material but that is not what this subreddit is intended for, low and high effort memes/images will at times have 5x the amount of karma any individual post will get and thus knock important personal questions down the listings and causing them even more unlikely to be seen which is a problem.

We still love memes and they are definitely a great way to cope and relate or just have fun so I suggest if you want to resubmit this image or browse other similar things you should head over to a sub like /r/gay_irl and check out their sidebar/rules as well as suggested communities and find a ton of great content (We are unaffiliated but they seem to be the place for gay memes).

Sorry to let you down on this topic, I know it seems a bit silly but we take our users problems really seriously and it's a terrible thought to me that we would instead go for the lowest common denominator and allow memes to fill the pages while those that are in desperate need of help and guidance are forgotten and pushed out so unfortunately this is the decision that was made.

I hope you can understand and either way I hope you have a really great day/night.

We still love memes and they are definitely a great way to cope and relate or just have fun so I suggest if you want to resubmit this image or browse other similar things you should head over to a sub like /r/gay_irl and check out their sidebar/rules as well as suggested communities and find a ton of great content (We are unaffiliated but they seem to be the place for gay memes).

Sorry to let you down on this topic, I know it seems a bit silly but we take our users problems really seriously and it's a terrible thought to me that we would instead go for the lowest common denominator and allow memes to fill the pages while those that are in desperate need of help and guidance are forgotten and pushed out so unfortunately this is the decision that was made.

Posts inquiring on users that may live in your area or trying to have discussions regarding who is going to an event or anything related to physical location discussion or similar is absolutely not allowed. We ban and deal with far too many middle aged pedophiles located around the world that we keep this discussion to an absolute minimum.

The most we have if you are interested on seeing if you are alone in the world regarding our userbase is [official map](http://www.lgbteensmap.com) and even that has a lot of fudged data in it and we highly advise heavily shifting your location on your own when adding a marker to be safe.

Unfortunately we strictly don't allow memes on the subreddit anymore (and at moderator discrection we usually remove other low effort images ""Ex: Check out this gay thing/This minecraft thing I did, ETC"") as we have noticed over time with no enforcement of this policy the subreddit it quickly moves away from the intended place of advice and discussion towards more of a /r/dankmemes meme filled subreddit which is fine for a subreddit that is intended for that kind of material but that is not what this subreddit is intended for, low and high effort memes/images will at times have 5x the amount of karma any individual post will get and thus knock important personal questions down the listings and causing them even more unlikely to be seen which is a problem.

We still love memes and they are definitely a great way to cope and relate or just have fun so I suggest if you want to resubmit this image or browse other similar things you should head over to a sub like /r/gay_irl and check out their sidebar/rules as well as suggested communities and find a ton of great content (We are unaffiliated but they seem to be the place for gay memes).

Sorry to let you down on this topic, I know it seems a bit silly but we take our users problems really seriously and it's a terrible thought to me that we would instead go for the lowest common denominator and allow memes to fill the pages while those that are in desperate need of help and guidance are forgotten and pushed out so unfortunately this is the decision that was made.

You must be wearing a shirt at all times in ANY picture posted here, even if just showing a tiny bit of skin. Drawing on clothing is not tolerated as users try to push the boundaries to subvert the rules, if you wish to post it must be a completely new image, cropping/marking out will not do. Any attempts to skirt the rule & this ruling in any titles, comments or the image its self will result in further punishment up and to including a permanent ban.

It may seem excessive but if you knew the amount of creeps/pedophiles we take care of on a daily to weekly basis you would understand why we are so strict and don't allow anything but the most PG stereotypical grandma-approved pictures on the subreddit to not give creeps anything to save or latch onto or anything of the like, plus we are dealing with an underage subreddit here it's honestly pretty common sense.

We used to allow it under very specific restrictions and other requirements but users kept pushing the line to try to get more and more and forced our hand to do a completely strict blanket ban.

You are totally free to post a different picture of course, as long as it too follows the rules.
