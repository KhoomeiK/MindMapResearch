RagenChastain,ffdhx59,t3_ers25z,1579821228.0,"This reminds me of those ""Virtual Half Marathon""s that people do, where they can get a medal for completing a half marathon by stringing together a month's worth of half mile jogs.

All I know is, I live close enough that if she does go through with her, ""I'm going to invite everyone, and there will be snack tables and fun music!"" BS that she spouted a few blog posts back, I am going to go out of my way to stop by and see whether or not this even exists. I have no vested interest in whether or not she completes this (I hope she succeeds!), but I find it appalling to ask people to support her monetarily if she's going to lie about her abilities.

My feelings about my body override the fact of the many, many bodies larger than mine — including yours.”

Literally no one is implying this. This is 100% made up in the heads of these insecure people."

But, like, which?” which deep dives into these Internet “chumbox,” which is all the weird chaff at the bottom of websites that are seemingly endless click holes.
