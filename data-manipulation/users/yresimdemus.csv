He's abusive.  That's clear. 

But mimicking his abusive behavior isn't the right thing to do.  Don't let him bring you down to his level.  And do not, under and circumstances, move away with him. 

What he's trying to do is isolate you.  By moving you somewhere else, getting you away from your support system, he's setting you up for additional abuse.  He will not get better once you're isolated, he will get worse.  So much worse. 

Get out now.  And please use his behavior as an example of what *not* to do to (or tolerate from) anyone else in the future."
dogs,ff3iwwc,t3_erdezp,1579542014.0,"Those markings pretty much guarantee some kind of north American sled dog ancestry: Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute, Alaskan Klee Kai, Miniature Husky, Labrador Husky (not a mix), or Northern Inuit Dog.  

Fortunately for you, every single one of those dogs is *very* high energy, regardless of size, and should have *no* problem keeping up with you, no matter how small he ends up being.

As for figuring out adult size, the puppy weight calculator at vetbabble suggests an adult weight of 30kg for a 24-week-old dog of 14kg.  However, it's really difficult to know how accurate that's going to be if you don't know the breed, because different breeds grow at different rates.  In general, a puppy of that weight with large breed ancestry is likely to top out at 29 kg, but a puppy with giant breed ancestry will top out at 38 kg, and a puppy with small breed ancestry will top out at 21 kg.  And even that's not really great, because some dog breeds (like Golden Retrievers) can grow at radically different rates than you'd expect based on their size.  And, even if you factor in all of those things, there's some degree of individual variation: my Brussels Griffon puppy was the biggest from his litter, 6.9 lbs at just 12 weeks, and my vet put his adult weight at a whopping 14.5 lbs, way over the breed maximum (his parents were both over the breed maximum, so this wasn't totally shocking, but he was still projected to be bigger than either of them).  He topped out at 7.8 lbs, making him smaller than either parent, either sibling, and even the breed minimum.

Based on the weight and appearance of the dog, I'm guessing he's a Siberian Husky mix, so his adult weight should be around 20kg *if* he gets his growth rate from his Siberian Husky ancestry.

If he takes his growth rate from a large breed, like a Husky, he'll reach his adult weight around 18 months of age, so you'll have your full answer then."
dogs,ff3dq6r,t1_ff3834b,1579539040.0,"Sorry your mom's breeder duped you, but CKC registry does *not* prove a dog is purebred. 

Unlike other breed registries, the CKC's *only* requirement for registration is that the dog appear to meet breed standards in 3 photos.  The theory behind this is that it allows for more genetic diversity.  However, it absolutely means that some dogs registered as purebred under the CKC are mixed breed dogs.  And, since genes ""hidden"" in one dog may show up in that dog's offspring, this can affect the traits that appear in that dog's puppies.

This is different from the AKC, which requires both parents be registered for a dog to be registered.  It's also different from the UKC, which allows dogs to be registered whose parents aren't registered (to improve genetic diversity), but requires a genetic test (to prove the dog is still purebred).

Of course, improving genetic diversity in our dogs is a *good* thing, and it shouldn't really matter too much to a pet owner whether a dog is purebred or mixed breed, especially when the pet owner wants a cross breed, anyway.  With that big a size difference, I'm guessing the Bichon had some poodle in her.  That doesn't make your mom's dog any less awesome, though."

dogs,ff09amn,t1_fezknb8,1579466597.0,"I definitely agree that I rescued the dog *from them.*  If I hadn't been so worried about him, I would've just kept my money and called it a loss.  But, in my mind, they didn't give af about the money, so it wouldn't have improved their treatment of the animals even a tiny bit, so the least I could do was make sure I saved the one animal I could.

I'm not as skeptical about rescues as you are, in general, though.  Perhaps I was particularly lucky, but all the ones I worked with (in multiple states) seemed to genuinely care about the animals, and took great pains to make sure their foster parents (myself included) were properly educated about their care and treatment.  And, of course, covered the vet visits, had me bring the animals to meet potential (screened) adopters and talk about the animal's idiosyncrasies with that person, etc.  

That's not to say I don't know there a bad ones out there.  I am certainly aware of hoarders & breeders that pose as rescues, but I haven't had many encounters with them.  There was one breed-specific actual rescue that I thought were lousy people, but I didn't work for them & it's hard to judge based off of one interaction.  But even they did what they thought was best for the animal, they just went about it in a lousy way towards the people involved.  So, presumably, their problem was that they prioritized the animal over any potential adopters.  Which seems to be the kind of thing you take issue with.

This is just a whole new low, in my mind.  An organization that is *listed on PetFinder* (one of the ways to tell if an organization is a rescue or not is to see if they're listed there), promoted by other rescues, has good ratings on Google Maps, has good rehoming policies, and vets potential adopters... that encourages people to *torture* their dogs?!"

dogs,fezkkwo,t1_fezh20s,1579458294.0,"I've never heard of a trainer advocating throwing stuff at a dog on a regular basis.  The closest I've seen is throwing something at the dog that makes noise, then rattling the thing to distract the dog in future instances of bad behavior.  Never throwing it at them every time.

I've also always been told that trainers who use choke collars recommend *against* using them to drag a dog. 

That said, regarding the mouse traps, a quick Google search reveals it as ""country wisdom"" and also reveals that dogs can lose their tongues (!) to them.  

As for whether or not it's actually illegal, Florida law is pretty vague on what constitutes animal abuse.  I assume that their county's animal control people will have a better idea of whether or not these specific behaviors are illegal. 

Of course, if it's *not* illegal, that makes it all the more important that I figure out some way to warn potential ""customers"" (for lack of a better term) about their practices.

AskReddit,fef4bpn,t3_eondj6,1579047865.0,"Honestly, the biggest issue for me would be that I'd have to stop taking my medications for a month.

Next, I'd deactivate all of my social media accounts for the month.

After that, piece of cake.

I'm in academia, so my longest must-be-on-campus workday is only about 4 hours.  Assume about an hour of driving time.  That leaves about 11 hours to drink 12 beers (I'd drink 1 beer per hour for the first 10 hours, and 2 beers in the 11th hour), and about 8 hours to sleep.  Granted, I'd be grading and writing lectures while buzzed, but a lot of my colleagues do that and aren't fired.   

Even if my teaching quality suffered, the student evaluations typically take months to affect your job (they absolutely *do* affect your job until you get tenure, an opportunity that is rapidly dwindling).  By that time, I'd already have the money.  Realistically, the only way for me to get fired in the middle of the semester would be to anger the administration.  So I'd make absolutely certain to attend every meeting and to avoid drinking on campus or discussing my drinking on social media.

At some point between when I checked to make sure the course was unpublished, and when I finished updating my syllabus some 16 hours later, the course published itself.  I was not happy, particularly since a few students had already worked on the first assignment, which I had planned to update (and now cannot).

It's possible your professor is unaware that you can even see the syllabus.  I wouldn't worry too much about it until the first class occurs.  If class starts and the syllabus is *still* incorrect, definitely mention something.  Updating the syllabus is extremely important, since holiday and final exam dates change every semester.

You need to ask yourself whether or not this is something you want to work through with him, or if you should end the relationship.  No one can decide that except you.  And you don't have to decide right away: you can opt to try to fix things, then leave later if it isn't working for you.

rapecounseling,fe7mx0i,t3_eo1udh,1578916713.0,"You're definitely being coerced.  That means it counts as sexual violence according to the WHO.

As for whether or not it counts as rape, specifically, it actually varies from state to state.  

The Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network would absolutely call it rape.  Their definition is ""sexual contact or behavior that occurs without explicit consent of the victim."" 

RAINN would probably also consider at least some of those situations to be considered rape.  Their definition is: ""Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.""  They then say consent requires that the consent be freely given, ""without being induced by fraud, coercion, violence, or threat of violence.""  Since he's coercing you, they would not consider you to have given consent.

However, regarding rape laws, they vary from state to state.  Some consider coerced consent to count as consenting sex (e.g., in Texas, he'd have to threaten or commit violence against you for what he did to count as sexual assault/rape).  Other states require affirmative consent (e.g., in California, consent requires positive cooperation, so what he did counts as rape under California law).

Regardless of whether or not what he's done fits the legal definition of rape where you live, it seems pretty clear that you're traumatized and that you want it to stop.

Since you intend to leave soon, anyway, perhaps you can try telling him to go ahead and use the app to find someone else to have sex with?  And see if that resolves the situation until you can get out?

Since it sounds like maybe the reason you haven't left is because you're financially stuck, you might check out the resources for abused spouses in your area.  There might be a shelter that can take you in or some such.

Also, regardless of any of the above, definitely seek out some type of counseling.  It doesn't have to be a crime to leave someone traumatized.  You have nothing to feel guilty for: you are *not* at fault in this situation!"

If you haven't already finalized plans, I strongly encourage you to have the bottom of the fence extended into the ground.  This can prevent the dog from burrowing out from under it, although you should still regularly inspect the yard and minimize the time the dog spends in the yard without supervision.

As for the home inspection, if you don't have toys and a dog bed, you should figure out where those will be kept.  Also, decide on a place where the dog's water will be, and where you'll be feeding him.  Be sure to convey all of this during the inspection.

One other thing I'd recommend is to check all the plants in your house/yard and remove anything toxic for dogs.  This isn't *really* related to the inspection, but more to the fact that dogs chew on plants, so having a dog-toxic plant in the dog's living/playing space is generally a bad idea."

I asked him how that felt, and he told me that he hates the system and he hates what happened to him, but that he understands how all these people feel, that he doesn't blame them, that they don't know any better, and that they're just trying to protect their families.

dogs,fd2c9w5,t3_ejmgju,1578145138.0,"Depends on the dog, depends on the person.  Before you downvote, please read why.

My boy Will?  That's a hard pass, I don't care what they're offering or what the circumstances are.  He's my baby.  And even more than that, actually, he's my partner. 

Arthur?  Maybe.  *If* they offered me enough that I thought it'd make a serious difference in Will's life *and* I was sure they'd be giving Arthur a great home, preferably better than what I could offer.  But we're talking in the 150k+ range (10k would not tempt me for a second).

Why Arthur and not Will?  Mostly because Arthur is still young enough that he hasn't decided I'm *his* human *forever.*  I used to foster dogs all the time, so I got used to accepting the idea that the dog might not live with me forever.  As long as I was sure they were going to a happy home, I comforted myself with that.  And with the knowledge that I saved *way* more dogs lives by rescuing them, rehabilitating them, and rehoming them than I ever could have by keeping them.  So it's not about not loving them; it's about loving them *and* accepting that I'm not the only good option out there (in some cases, not even the best option).

But Will is attached to me at the hip.  No way would he ever get over it.  He would pine away for me.  And me for him. 

All that said, the reason I stopped fostering was for Will: he started getting upset whenever the newest dog/cat (yes, we fostered cats, too) was rehomed.  So I gave it up for his mental health.  Which is why they'd have to offer me life-changing money.  Because I'd have to feel like the things I could offer Will would make up, in the long run, for taking away his buddy.  I mean, I'm not rich by any stretch of the imagination (as you may have guessed based on the fact that 150k would be truly life-changing), so knowing I could afford food, housing, and literally any medical issue that came up for Will for the remainder of his life would, I think, be worth it.  He has earned anything and everything I can give him.

But, honestly, it'd *still* be hard on me to rehome Arthur that way.

Fortunately for me, no one pays that much for a dog, no matter how well-trained, so I'll never have to deal with it."

""Downtown"" consisted of a post office/general store (run by the same person, but 2 doors with the counter in the middle) and the entrance to the dump. 

There was a gas station on the other side of town.

There were no other businesses in town.

There were no traffic lights.  The first traffic light you hit told you you'd left town. 

There were no schools in the town.  We were bussed to a county school.

There was one church in the town.  It wasn't our denomination.  My parents drove us to the next town over for church.

The county school had a prayer hour (twice a week?), and our parents wouldn't sign the forms for us to join (wrong denomination again).   That was a problem for some of the parents & they didn't want their kids playing with us.  We spent prayer hour copying definitions from the dictionary.  But it ""wasn't a punishment.""

Everyone knew everyone.  Which also meant that everyone knew everyone's kids.

People were absolutely attached to their animals.  Not the steers or the weaners or anything, but the horses and the occasional dairy calf and - most importantly - the dogs.  This is important to keep in mind before reading further: people were super attached to their dogs.  And everyone knew it.

We had one lesbian couple (no male gays).  They were incredibly nice to us kids & we didn't realize they were a couple.  Just assumed they were sisters.  Didn't understand why people didn't like them.  And I never realized just *how much* they were hated until one of them died.  Her kids contested the will and won literally everything.  Then, just to show that they were total pieces of garbage, they took the show (very expensive, top-of-the-line) dogs and, rather than sell them for top dollar, shot each and every one of them to death in front of the surviving woman.  It sent her over the edge, and she died in an institution.  To this day, I think about those PoS kids and hope that everything in their lives is just awful.  Like, if their kids get cancer and the whole line dies out, good riddance.  Or if their kids realize their parents are PoS and cut off all contact, so they die broken & alone, even better.  I've never hated anyone as much as I hate them.  The only thing she *ever* did to them was love their mom.  And the dogs didn't do *anything* to deserve that.  It had a huge impact on me, and my entire career has been informed by it.

But for some reason, what sticks in my mind as a defining feature of a small town, more than anything, is that the road surface became soft in spots in the summer suns.  Not because it got just so hot, but because of the way the roads were made (cheaply).  We'd walk across it barefoot because it was fun to leave footprints (and apparently we'd lost all the nerve endings in our feet from being barefoot all the time)."

One example springs to mind from mid-December: a woman from high school posted an image of a man wearing a 1940's/1950's style suit, followed by a picture of a man wearing a rainbow crop top.   It said ""something went terribly wrong!""  It had a *lot* of support.  I was furious, but figured that wouldn't go over well, so I posted something like 'I think both are cool.'  Got one like, but then was told that I was the problem.

And, at least in my age group, I haven't noticed much difference between male and female assumptions.  I think they actually play into each other: I think a lot of men expect their wives (and girlfriends) to be very attractive all the time, to keep the house, to take care of the kids, and so on.  So the women feel totally justified in expecting their husbands (and boyfriends) to be emotionally and financially supportive, and to dress in a way that exudes masculinity.  From that perspective, I guess how I could see a man challenging gender roles could be insulting: they don't get to challenge motherhood/sexiness gender roles, so when men challenge their roles, the women feel like meeting all those expectations has been all for nothing.  Like it's suddenly become a one-way street.  They don't seem capable of grasping that allowing some leeway in masculine gender roles would also open up women to challenge their roles, as well.

I've also run into the issue on other Reddit subs, although age is less of a known element on here.

Meanwhile, also in mid-December, my college freshmen students, when writing about their genders, were largely (all but 2 students) very reflective about internalized misogyny and gender norms.  Some of them were very much in conformity with expected gender roles, but still felt like people should just be people.  I *really* hope that what I'm seeing from these younger folks are signs of what is to come, and not just a reflection of the place I teach.  Living with others' expectations of us solely due to gender is just exhausting, and I don't wish it on anyone."

AskReddit,fcx81ou,t3_eixc75,1578054941.0,"Almost all of my online dating experience was with OkCupid.  I was on there for about 10 years, off-and-on (with breaks when I was dating someone, including one that lasted 4 years).  I also tried PoF, eHarmony, and Match, but I didn't meet anyone from any of those sites.  PoF is great if you're average-looking, but should be avoided if you're a 7+ because you will be overwhelmed with messages.  Match is awful, because *so many* people there haven't paid for it and will *never* answer you (waste of time and money!).  As for eHarmony, it's great *only if* you're a devout Christian who *only* wants to meet other devout Christians.

My advice for *all* online dating sites/apps:

1.  Anyone who says ""you're not like all the other X"" (where ""X"" is a category to which you belong) or who insults any category to which you belong is *not* worth your time.  At best, that person is incredibly insecure.  At worst, that person is abusive.  You want no part in either.

2.  Corollary to #1: Never say ""you're not like all the other X"" and never insult any category to which the other person belongs.

3.  Don't mention your ex!

4.  Never, ever, ever do any transactions with anyone, no matter how benign they may seem, until you've met *in person.*  Video chat means nothing; GPS location means nothing.  Scammers can alter their apparent location and now even have the ability to appear as someone different in a different location through *live* video (my friend just discovered this the hard way).

5.  For your first date, meet somewhere public.  This is for your safety (or, if you're not worried about your safety, for their comfort).

6.  I know it's hard, but try not to take it personally when people ghost you or stand you up.  It happens *a lot,* and you never know what's going on.  Sometimes, there's a harmless explanation (e.g., stuck in traffic; phone bricked itself) and you can try again.  Other times, you'll never find out.  But if you start sending them nasty messages, you've exposed yourself as a desperate/abusive person, and they will certainly not talk to you again.  Even if you're 100% certain you aren't interested in that person any longer, still don't send nasty messages: there's a chance they may screen shot the chat and show others.  Just let it go.

My advice for OkCupid: 

1.  Put some effort into your profile!  If you can't be bothered to fill in all of the details, take some good (recent) pictures, and answer *at least* 50 questions... don't bother.  Most women will not message you or reply to you if you don't have a complete profile.  Most men who will message you or reply to you without a complete profile are literally messaging everyone and are just looking for a one night stand.

2.  Be honest.  If there's a question you don't feel you can answer honestly, skip it.

3.  Look for questions about things that are important to you and answer those.

4.  Set up dates with your matches after about 5-10 messages back-and-forth.  If you wait much longer than that, it's likely to fizzle out.  If they want to wait much longer than that, they may be a scammer.  Be reasonable & use your best judgement here: 10 short messages aren't going to put someone at their ease as well as 5 detailed messages.  Waiting less time is ok, but be warned that a lot of women will ghost you if you suggest meeting in the first 1-2 messages (I think they assume you're a serial killer or something).

5.  If they throw up major red flags in those messages, *believe them!*

As for my results, let's see:

My first match on OkCupid was with a good friend of mine.  This was a bad thing, because I wasn't interested.  It created some tension.  We're over it now, but it took a while.

The number of married people who messaged me (on all sites except eHarmony) was *ridiculous.*  I didn't meet any afaik.  I managed to avoid it by asking for their Facebook profile (I didn't always ask for that info, but did if I saw minor red flags).  Most cheaters will give you the info if you ask for it, and you'll find their spouse listed right there!

About 1/3 of the people who I was supposed to meet stood me up and/or ghosted me.  This was very upsetting at first, but I learned not to take it personally after a while.

Overall, I actually met roughly a tenth of the people I *exchanged* messages with.  (I'm only counting people who replied to my first message, or whose first message I replied to.)

I met about 5 people who I ended up being friends with (no ""spark"" but we got along well).  I'm *still* good friends with 2 of them.

I met about 20 people who didn't go past the first date, even as friends, because there was no ""spark"" for one or both of us.  Nice people, just no future there.

I met about 10 people (i.e., about 1/4 of the people I met) who were just plain awful in one way or another.  Mostly narcissists, three users, and two actually abusive.  All revealed themselves within the first date or two.  They revealed what dating them would be like, and I believed them and moved on.

I met 2 incredibly flaky people.

I dated 3 people for a few months each before it ended for various reasons.

I met one person who I am now married to.  ❤

Best gift I got: my mom unknowingly paid for the cremation of my dog, who died on Christmas Eve.  She never would've given me the money if she'd known it was for that, but I was *so* grateful that the money was there when he died. 

Worst gift I gave: a pack of beer to my BIL.  He was quite happy with it.  My mother-in-law... not so much. 

Worst gift I got: nothing, from my husband.  😕"

My point is that even very young people can be aunts and uncles.  So you're even more correct than you thought.  😊"

The way it works is: everyone updates her with new contact info, as well as births/deaths, via email.  She then updates the Excel file.  She then sends that file to *hundreds of people* at the end of each year so that they don't have to do *any* work to keep their family contact information updated.

They then, individually, decide whether to hand-copy addresses or to have them printed out.

You can't do that with a box full of envelopes.  In that case, you're only doing the work for yourself.  And sure, it's not much work.  But when you put in the extra time to turn it into a digital copy, it's suddenly sharable to anyone you feel like sharing it with.

Is *she* doing more work as an individual?  Yes, you could argue that (although since she literally copies and pastes the information from email, I'm not 100% convinced).  But *literally hundreds of people* now don't have to put in *any* effort whatsoever.  And everyone knows it.  So she gets mad respect by everyone, and anyone in my family will drop what they're doing to help her if she asks.  One of my cousins once accompanied her on a cross-country trip solely because my aunt said she didn't want to go alone.

....

Now that I think of it, I'm 100% convinced that she does *far* less work, in the long run.  Because, again, anyone in my family will do whatever they can to help her out.  (Not that she abuses it in any way, mind you.  She's awesome.)"

AskReddit,fcn5iwb,t1_fcmu7bi,1577803823.0,"There are cases when an abortion is a medically necessary emergency.  A hospital can *still* refuse to do it, and can even refuse to refer the patient to another hospital.   In fact, the way the law is written, they can even fail to inform the woman that an abortion is the best/only option to save her life.  This is literally how women die.

personalfinance,fcmxn56,t1_fcl8x9h,1577796744.0,"Having grown up in a rural area, I'd say they almost certainly fall into the ""college means hippy intellectual"" crowd.  Anyone who wants to go to college is put into that group, and is assumed to think they're better than everyone else.  

Thus, his desire to go to college is seen as a rejection of them *and* their values.  It's absolutely stupid, but I saw it over and over again.

Also, there's nothing new about that attitude.  It's just that non-rural people have recently become more aware of it."
Goldendoodles,fcmw2fc,t3_eekro3,1577794911.0,"Actually, my puppy experienced something similar.   My vet was convinced he was getting into something in the yard.  After about 6 weeks, it went away just as mysteriously as it had appeared.  My vet still thinks it was something in the yard and that whatever it was is no longer in season.

That said, checking into the dog's diet isn't a bad idea.

Before going grain-free, however, please be aware that recent studies are showing a link between grain-free diets and DCM (heart disease).  The primary breed used in the studies was the golden retriever.

My goldendoodle boy got DCM last year, and the veterinary cardiologist told me it was almost certainly due to diet.  And, sure enough, the food I was giving him popped up on the FDA's list of suspect foods when they published it this year.

I switched diets and started giving him heart meds right after he was diagnosed, and his DCM improved, but he's got to be on (expensive!) medication for the rest of his life.  And, even then, it will probably be a shorter life than he would have otherwise had.

Unfortunately, just because a grain-free diet didn't make the list doesn't mean it's safe: it's possible that it's too new for it to have been eaten long enough, or that it's a very small brand, so not enough dogs were on it.

Your best bet is to talk to a veterinary cardiologist about your dog's diet.  There's *so much* bad information out there and it's easy to get confused."

MensLib,fcldew9,t1_fckk4c9,1577745225.0,"I suspect that they have trans people in their lives who they (think they?) love, and are trying to deal with the cognitive dissonance between loving the trans person and being transphobic.  It's the perfect solution in that case: I love you, so I *can't* accept your trans identity because it would cause you to commit suicide.  

Of course, if that loved one commits suicide, they also don't have to face any role they played in it.  Because it was all those other people who ""encouraged"" the trans person to ""be"" trans that are at fault."
MensLib,fck9kxy,t1_fcjkd7k,1577720246.0,"I came across a view recently that's apparently been published by some transphobe.  There's some research that suggests that confirmation surgeries don't actually reduce (or increase, but he leaves that bit out or, more accurately, lies about it) the risk of suicide in people who want the surgery.  So this whakadoodle apparently put out a book that the other transphobes are using that completely misinterprets the study by comparing post-op trans suicide risk in MTF (the highest) to the group that have no interest in surgery of any kind (the lowest), and then tries to use that to argue that trans is a mental disease and that accepting trans people means increasing their risk of suicide because you're normalizing their destructive behavior or some such bs.

If you look at the actual study, it focused solely on suicide and the way it was done was a bit problematic (since it looks at lifetime attempts, and obviously people who have gotten the surgery were once people who wanted the surgery but couldn't get it yet, so there's literally no way that the risk could have gone down within the parameters of the study).  Anyway, I digress, because it's not actually important to what these creeps have done wrong.   This study looked at a large number of factors and compared suicide risk in all cases.  And the single most important factor was?

Acceptance.  People who were accepted had significantly lower rates of suicide.

So this guy & all his followers are literally going against the conclusion of the study (that acceptance is the most important factor in reducing suicide risk), and *claiming* that they're doing it because they just care so much and don't want trans people to commit suicide."
