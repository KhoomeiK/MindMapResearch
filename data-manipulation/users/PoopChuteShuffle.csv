No normal person wants an abusive asshole from their past hanging around being friends. Especially someone they used to sleep with. 

You're getting shit on. She doesn't respect you or your ""perfect relationship"" enough to cut loose an ex. Is it really perfect? Or are you just blind? If you move on she'll be back in his bed before the door slams behind you."

TwoXChromosomes,ff9i14b,t3_es9hed,1579713452.0,"Wouldn't the correct solution be to make the abuser leave and then charge them with tresspassing or assault or whatever is appropriate if they come back? 

I was once a landlord. Didnt suit me having to enforce rules and pretty much monetize someone's living situation. But that aside, when I had tenants that had a domestic dispute (she was cheating, he found out and freaked) I served him with an eviction notice and told her she could stay but he wasn't welcome to live there. 

If she were to invite him there and they have ongoing problems then they're both the problem and I would have evicted them both. This seems like the obvious solution that holds people responsible for their own actions."

Good stuff by all reports but I used structured mesh from the Amphora Society before ever hearing of SPP and never really saw a reason to change.

It's been 10 years since I ran a hobby still. There were some very inventive and interesting guys on the forums back then. Then everyone started buying and selling parts and everything got weird. 

Took me back. I miss that hobby. Thanks OP."

AskMen,ff5v89u,t3_erlbbu,1579611409.0,"Kind of late but maybe someone will laugh: 

I went on a first date at 32 y.o. after being divorced. I'd been alone for 2 years and felt like I was ready to give it a try but didnt have many ways to meet new people. So I tried Match. 

Met a cute girl and she asked me to meet up for drinks at a local chain restaurant. Im dressed nicely, looking forward to meeting the pretty, well put together woman she presented. She comes in dressed in sweats with no makeup and her hair in a pony tail. The lack of effort was disappointing but whatever. Conversation was pretty good until she eventually started showing me pics of the girls she used to fuck when she was in the Army in Germany. I wasn't used to discussing previous partners so casually but went with it. 

Eventually she asks me for a ride home because ""she meant to buy a car today but couldnt get a loan without a job so her brother-in-law just dropped her off"" Ok. Cool. I'll take her home and maybe we can try again when she is a little more prepared. 

I take her home and she asks if I want to watch some Netflix and talk. So I come in expecting to do just that. (Didnt know netflix and chill was a thing) she excuses herself while I surf and comes back naked except for socks. 

I was surprised but flattered and didnt want to reject her. On my last first date a guy had to work for it so this was all new. Anyway, we start messing around and her scent is identical to my ex wife. Identical. I just had to leave. As I am trying to tell her it's all too fast and I'm not ready for sex she then says ""Come back to bed. I'm on Morena. You don't even need a condom""

I left. As I'm leaving she asks if I'll call her. I declined. 10 days later she sent me a pic of her boobs, which were splendid. But I never saw her again."
