dogs,fglxx9l,t3_eyu452,1580913637.0,"I think it's possible to train a dog to do just about anything. We are working on the ""quiet"" command with our dog, time will tell if it helps."
dogs,fgjv7bw,t3_eyvs31,1580852030.0,"I would tell my dog that I'd always come back for her after I went somewhere, since I worried that she remembered her original family leaving her. That's the reason I stayed with her while she died, I knew she wouldn't know but I couldn't leave her in that room knowing I wouldn't come back for her."
dogs,fgjsgqe,t3_eyu452,1580850505.0,"Being verbal doesn't mean aggressive, I think it will mostly depend on how the other dog reacts. Like others have said, if the dog yours is playing with looks scared or nervous then yours is probably giving off unfriendly signals. My 1 yr staffy sounds horribly mean when he plays tug, but our other dog comes right over to play with him and he never tries to lunge or bite, so I think you just need to watch the dogs carefully and maybe work on getting your dog to be quiet while playing. Some dogs sound a lot meaner than they are."
Anxiety,fgjcqn1,t3_eytzid,1580841312.0,"Corny but true, haha. It's good to remind yourself once in a while!"
dogs,fgb4pxe,t3_exg0ml,1580658496.0,"I had to go through this recently too. He sounds like an awesome dog, and you've got a lot of love to give to your next one."
crafts,fgb3b1l,t3_exnget,1580658136.0,Very neat! I love the wolf.
Dogtraining,fg2cafk,t1_fg1n90e,1580442314.0,"Yup, and I do call him off when one of them starts getting agitated. I think if he was truly aggressive I would have noticed by now, he just has some behaviors we need to work on. I want to give them enough space so that he can learn from the older dog when to back off, but not too much that it escalates."
relationships,fg1e37n,t3_ew7o92,1580425461.0,"Haven't read through all the comments so I apologize if I'm repeating anything. I guess the answer to your question ""would it be reasonable for him to dump me"" can be yes or no. If it's important to him to be with a go-getter who earns more, then he's not going to be happy with you. On the flip side, you need someone who can support you (emotionally, not necessarily financially) while you are struggling. If he thinks less of you because of your mental health, etc. then that's going to wear you down too. 

From personal experience, I used to have a good job and made decent money, then I decided to switch careers and am making almost half of what I was. I met my current bf when I was between jobs and only working part-time. I worried the same as you that he'd see me as a failure and leave me in the dust, but he saw that I was trying and liked me enough to stick around. You're still working, and even if you aren't pressing forward you're still trying and hanging in there. 

Self-growth takes a long time (lifetime, really) and you need people around you who will be patient and supportive. You've already made great progress just by acknowledging it and taking steps to improve. I'd say focus more on making yourself happy rather than him."
Dogtraining,fg1am4u,t1_fg160sf,1580423769.0,"She looks like she wants him out of her business, sometimes she will get up and move but no nipping or growling (yet). New dog wants to play but other dog is old and doesn't want to. He might just want attention from her."
Dogtraining,fg13slv,t1_fg0qur9,1580420189.0,"I certainly didn't get the sense that he was being assertive, he's been respectful of my commands so far and is gentle and sweet. He does like to stand over the other dog when she's laying down so I'm not sure what to make of that. Just going to keep watching his behavior and learn how to read him."
Dogtraining,fg13h07,t1_fg0p972,1580420022.0,"I'm like 90% sure also, haha. My other pit mix loved to cuddle as well but she didn't sit in my lap. I don't think my new one realizes how big he is, it's just funny to have a giant dog in my lap."
Dogtraining,fg139l5,t1_fg0nvbn,1580419918.0,"That's how I interpreted it too, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing important signals! I think he just wants to be close."
Anxiety,fg0c38k,t1_ffwvzes,1580404658.0,"I spent years trying to figure out what my problem with food was. I saw a therapist and even a dietician for a while. The simpler the better for me, and luckily a lot of food can be delivered these days so if you REALLY can't bring yourself to do anything and you have the funds, that's an option. Good luck! It's a long struggle but you're definitely not the only one, and try to get those around you on board and let them know your struggles and how they can help. My mom would sometimes come over to make me food or we would go out for lunch."
Anxiety,ffwpk3t,t1_ffv2ud9,1580307865.0,"If I forget to eat it's because I'm busy doing something else and don't realize I am hungry. If my depression is really bad I will be hungry but the thought of eating makes me want to cry. I also hate cooking, so having handy snacks and easy meals, or going out worked much better. My biggest problem is that I get bored while eating, that's why eating with someone or having another means of distraction is nice. Setting a timer for meals might help, and have easy snacks around like popcorn, a granola bar, or a protein drink."
Anxiety,ffv2lqh,t3_ev8idm,1580254235.0,"I have problems with food as well, normally food just isn't exciting to me. Sometimes I think skipping meals is my version of self-harm, other times I straight up forget to eat. It helps me to eat with someone else (now that I live with my partner I eat meals regularly), to have a variety of food, and/or to have a distraction while eating, such as a TV show."
Dogtraining,ffqe7g1,t3_erofv1,1580131914.0,"We will be adding a new dog to the house soon as well, and it sounds like you've been doing everything you're supposed to, from what I've read. I wouldn't want to give up on the new dog so quickly, but also make sure your current dog is safe and doesn't learn bad behaviors from this. I hope things work out."
dogs,ff07lwr,t1_fezqv34,1579466063.0,"Yes absolutely, being housebroken is a must. I worry about creating too much stress for the dog (moving into foster care, then a new home, then another new home) but we don't know exactly when we will move and it won't be for a few months anyway, and by then I think the dog will have adjusted to us."
dogs,ff07aay,t1_fezg665,1579465938.0,"Yes, I had always heard from people that it is best to not get another pet right away, but as long as I have realistic expectations I think it will be just fine. I know no dog will ever be just like my girl was and it will take time for the new dog to adjust to it's new life, but I'm sure we would all be happy."
dogs,ff05z4n,t1_fezaxhe,1579465567.0,"Thanks! I did worry that I would try to replace my previous dog, but now I just want another one to pour my love into, one that has its own quirks and personality."
