The film is just ablative protection for during handling to keep dirt/grease/scratches off when those things are more likely.

I'll leave it on if it looks okay but first sign of anything like OP and it's time to expose the working surface."
PublicFreakout,ffkd6hu,t1_ffk6xnd,1580020832.0,What I find crazy is how this happens so consistently. It's not happening anywhere else. India has a lot of people too. They're in the process of modernizing and have cities. They don't have the best sanitation. And yet none of this seems to happen there. It's not some proportional split by population. China just keeps breeding epidemic fodder way more often than anyone else.

BestOfReports,ffjeha7,t1_ffje6d4,1579996553.0,If someone hands you a food you've never had before how do you decide your opinion on it? Do you decide it's good or bad based solely on what they tell you your opinion should be?
BestOfReports,ffjch3y,t1_ffjcda1,1579995388.0,"> it turns out im more comfortable this way!

Yes, that's a personal preference that existed (but was unrealized) all along."
BestOfReports,ffjc7zz,t1_ffjay3c,1579995244.0,"> It suggests that Transgenders are that way because of what other people identify them as

No, that is not suggested at all. The external treatment revealed a trait that was already present."
Cooking,ffj3o72,t1_ffj2ovh,1579989575.0,Oh is that all that matters? I thought that cooking videos were used as learning material and also that celebrities were often emulated by their fans which makes a double whammy in this case. So good to know nobody ever did either of those things though. Imagine if they did and people had to actually admit they're doing something unsafe in the form of a simple disclaimer at the start of the video or something. That would completely ruin all value after all.
Cooking,ffj0mxu,t1_ffi0oq2,1579987401.0,"She can be stupid *and* follow a script too.

I'd argue that she has to be either stupid or evil to publish something with the food safety problems we see here."
politics,ffhrhoq,t1_ffh8h6t,1579950071.0,"No. The facts are clear.

They're just going to ignore reality because there is nothing to prevent them. I can only hope that this results in the total collapse of the Republican party in the next few years. It's them or the democracy. Something is collapsing."
todayilearned,ffhppmn,t1_ffgywxw,1579947307.0,That exact style wouldn't be my first choice but a basement arcade/bar/something is a classic in-case-of-excess-disposable-income item.
todayilearned,ffhpm70,t1_ffho0cw,1579947159.0,"Collecting is weird as anything humans do. Why make music? Why look at stars and decide they're in the shape of a spoon? Why do anything.

Collecting is really fun. Picking something small and unnecessary but sentimentally, aesthetically, or intellectually interesting is a perfectly great hobby.

It's not anything about information age or whatever. Some people love photos for example and take tons. I don't really like photos as keepsakes. Some people don't care for things much at all. I have family at all extremes."
KitchenConfidential,ffhmc9h,t1_ffghnlv,1579942150.0,Labor protections require across the board legislative change. Any restaurant owner who voluntarily accepts a handicap by treating their employees fairly is appreciated but is putting themselves at a disadvantage compared to any amoral competition.
KitchenConfidential,ffhm8e8,t1_ffg6xru,1579941988.0,"> it's going to take some creativity to right it.

Or some very simple legal reform.

This isn't anything groundbreaking. A majority of the world doesn't have the problem."
dataisbeautiful,ffgm6aw,t1_ffgfc5c,1579909458.0,"There are a lot of problems there but verbose writing isn't one of them.

Persuasive writing is a poster child for where flowery language is most welcome. Using common phrases and worn out idioms is just going to put the audience to sleep, shut down critical thinking, and leave them to stagnate in their original mindset. Uncommon phrases, used well, stimulate readers. It's possible to use them poorly of course. It's possible to use them in the wrong context.

Complaining about people writing like that instantly conjures a mental image of the reader as an illiterate hillbilly with few teeth and fewer brain cells."
todayilearned,ffggfll,t1_ffftxeb,1579905661.0,"Disagree. Biological and technical solutions are so far apart still that it's often hard to replicate one with another. In the case of maggots they're so ridiculously effective I expect they'll be used for a long time yet. As our ability to manipulate biology progresses there will be other solutions as well.

What would we replace maggots with? Purely chemical solutions are not as thorough or gentle. Mechanical options need a lot of fine control. Maggots combine several tools together and include an intelligent (enough) control system.

We have some icky connotations from biology now but in the future I think it will gain more positive associations."
politics,ffgevtw,t1_ffficbo,1579904682.0,"They've convinced a portion of the population that facts and reality are optional. That they are negotiable. Their base is as stubborn as them and they're too all-in on this tactic to switch to anything else. The sane, functioning people will never vote for them again already."
soylent,ffgc9kf,t1_ffgbzui,1579903052.0,"What does that have to do with the study results? The fact that they're there isn't the misinformation. Bringing it up like it's somehow relevant is.

edit: I take that silence as you knowing you're wrong but wanting to troll too badly to admit it."
soylent,ffgbddq,t3_etgrax,1579902505.0,"So instead of posting something close to the original study from last week you went with a heavily editorialized title and then added further misinformation on top of it?

Smells like bait to me. Care to prove otherwise?"
