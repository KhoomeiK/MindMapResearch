askscience,ffh2ayl,t3_etkdx1,1579921197.0,Is there a reason so many novel diseases seem to come from China? Is it a population thing - causing or spreading? Is there a hygiene issue? Or is it just that these diseases get more press?
worldnews,ffgroex,t1_ffgn24p,1579913332.0,"Ah so it’s a punishment?

I can think of lots of reasons. The most important one is it makes them want to hurt you again. America’s foreign policy is horrifyingly self-defeating and you don’t even know it."
Games,ffev9k2,t1_ffej1fl,1579867031.0,Fine with me as long as it doesn’t go all arcady like Mass Effect 2 did. I loved that game but I’d much prefer a more classic experience.
politics,ffeu2w2,t1_ffeoquq,1579865559.0,Only Republicans and babies think that things they're not looking at don't exist.

worldnews,ffekggw,t1_ffej5ln,1579851775.0,Read the link.
worldnews,ffeieab,t1_ffehocv,1579849252.0,Seriously? To what end? Did you not read the link that explains it doesn’t lead to useful information?

Do you think it works? [It doesn’t.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-rsquo-ve-known-for-400-years-that-torture-doesn-rsquo-t-work/)

Bullying makes you weak. Look at America, can’t even operate without bullying and torturing. Pathetic."
gadgets,ffdxd8i,t1_ffd18op,1579831278.0,The image wouldn’t be in focus but if you had two contact lenses you could probably simulate a 3D object at a particular point in space. Not sure about the quality…
politics,ffdvr38,t1_ffduvf0,1579830130.0,Why would you just go and admit that you’re ignorant right here in public?
newzealand,ffdpl77,t1_ffdoa99,1579825931.0,"Uh, no.

Of course context matters. But disliking Chinese interference doesn’t imply that someone likes American interference."
newzealand,ffdjzi7,t1_ffdhmrh,1579822491.0,"1. There aren’t enough jobs for everybody. Simple as that.

2. The alternative to good social welfare is unbelievable homelessness. Visit America some time."
newzealand,ffdggcm,t1_ffdf8bl,1579820349.0,"Yes American interference is bad. No, America is not “the good guy”.

This article is talking about Chinese interference though. It says Chinese interference is bad.

Do you agree?

Seriously I have very little patience for comments like yours.

“The Australian wildfires are bad”

BeAmazed,ffd6ahy,t1_ffd4x2t,1579814252.0,VR would be incredible. The cam on the racer could even follow your head tracking.

Wellington,ffbq4re,t3_esmt94,1579778122.0,"As much as the housing shortage is affecting my ability to buy, if I had to make a list of people who should have access to a home, at the top would be those who’d be homeless without one.

At the bottom would be people who already own one."
newzealand,ffbph5d,t1_ffbk7y6,1579777194.0,"To be honest that’s a good question. The only answer is tax. I’m well into the top tax bracket so it’s likely I’d see some personal income gains when they inevitably cut the rate.

But yeah, even on that metric the inequity created by the cut just comes back to bite anybody who saw personal gain."
newzealand,ffbgp0q,t1_ffbgadd,1579764500.0,"Yup. National is better for me, but I don’t really need the assistance. Especially not at the expense of the people Labour or Greens would help."
newzealand,ffbepzf,t1_ffb8t4x,1579762101.0,"The annoying part of this is, on any metric that Labour is underperforming, National wouldn’t even try. Affordable housing? Fuck no. Environment? Come on. Distance from foreign dictatorships? Give me a break.

Labour’s doing a fantastic job for some people, and they’re still the best choice, even if we’re not getting everything we want."
DesignPorn,ffb8dik,t1_ffb86ml,1579754857.0,"If they’re anything like my Bose headphones, they partially rotate the other way, to conform with your head, but they fully rotate the other way so they can be folded and put away easily."

It was so memorable that when I was 10 I correctly guessed my friend had it, which was lucky because we were at boarding school and he’d decided to try and ignore it and go to bed."
newzealand,ff8qxhf,t1_ff7rwo7,1579692437.0,"The really depressing thing is that this hurts Labour’s re-election chances, which is *insane* because National would not just be worse at this, their policies would be actively counter to improving New Zealand’s housing situation."

I wonder if they’ll take down the abandoned building next door on Wolfe St. I explored that a few times. Creeepy."
politics,ff8po0o,t3_es0ax2,1579690679.0,I can’t believe you’re just letting yourselves be scammed like this by your own government. You should be ashamed.
Wellington,ff8n5op,t3_es5foc,1579686904.0,"There’s heaps of crap painted in this colour around town right now. Dick and balls on Mercer, as well as lines on bins and manhole covers."
newzealand,ff8gstl,t1_ff8cekd,1579677822.0,I guess it’s like… Kiwi kids can still be weetbix kids regardless of what kind of kids Aussie kids are.
newzealand,ff7wfnq,t1_ff7v9ix,1579659977.0,True that.

Just, routinely cutting off a piece of a baby… it’s just so weird to think about, for most of the world."
