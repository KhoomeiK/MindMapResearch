rational,feiutit,t1_fei2x57,1579147804.0,"I love that the author takes these things into consideration, it's what puts this story head and shoulders above the works of most authors I've read.

It kind of signals that it's okay to think deeply about the story and get engaged with it, and I find exploring the process a very enjoyable reading on its own.

I have some high hopes for the out of shape characters, they must have some first class mental stats to be picked and have made it this far despite the severe physical disadvantage. Like if they were the kid who was enthusiastically curious about everything and went on regular Wikipedia binges and actually retained most of the info or something.

Might not be great in direct combat but could become a fantastic force multiplier if they are allowed to grow. So much of a scenario like this is about discovering and making the right choices and learn fast from mistakes at as small a risk as feasible.

There are a few exciting possibilities I see right away.

There is of course building mundane rabbitsnares to catch beavers with Nathan's survival skill, but it proves promising that they might be able to SNARE the goblins and systematically steal their weapons and armor.

Having a shallow hidden spike pit might also be helpful for the boss now that they can sharpen wood with their steel knives, so far it seems pretty simple to lure even intelligent-ish enemies into traps due to their extreme aggression.

Still greatly enjoying this work and all the rational aspects of it. Every time I think ""why don't they just...? And someone in the story proceeds to bring up that very question I get a warm happy feeling inside.

I see the effort tge author puts into making this a rational story and I appreciate it.

And it's not a case of ""be like me or else"" but one of ""stop violating human rights, denying people free elections and committing war crimes"", things that the US routinely criticizes other countries for, so it's not like we'd be pushing an unreasonable standard on anyone.

AskScienceFiction,feid6uz,t1_fehhisf,1579135757.0,"I say this as an economist: *Everything* is about cost.

Everything you do is a dozen things you didn't do. The alternative cost of the Death Star is absurdly high.

Additionally, in a galaxy-sixed empire such a fleet would not only theoretically be pretty low (similar issue as ""1 million units on the way"" when there's over a billion planets) but also be divided into smaller fleets of 3-10 ships that should be enough to handle virtually anything rebels or pirates can throw at them.

And for all the power of the death star, it doesn't do anything meaningfully different from a fleet of 5 star destroyers. The terror of having your planet exploded is only marginally greater than the terror of your planet being glassed from orbit by a fleet you have no chance of stopping.

And with more star destroyers capable of doing it, they would be painfully aware that a fleet capable of doing it is only a few systems away rather than on the far side of the galaxy."
