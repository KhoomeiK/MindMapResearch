CollegeBasketball,ffffmc3,t1_fffdo9a,1579882907.0,Nope. All of it is within the city limits except an intermural field or something like that. Definitely not most.
CollegeBasketball,fffdgp7,t1_fffdae7,1579881544.0,But it isn't.  It's inside the city limits. Right on the border. But still in them.

sports,feiwb9o,t1_feiqx5n,1579148972.0,Ok. But that doesn't answer my question.   Is it only masturbation that counts as fap. Or do they swear off all orgasms no matter how it happens.
sports,fein8kj,t1_feidqzv,1579142489.0,So does sex count as a fap? Or a bj or hj? If the point is to reduce porn and get yourself out there talking to real girls I would think not.

Also what the fuck is a ""dank"" meme? This has to be the worst excuse for breaking the rules I've ever seen. How in the world am I supposed to determine something that is ""dank"" from a normal shitty meme. It sounds toatally subjective. At least a shockwave has an actual definition."

NatureIsFuckingLit,fcvohpi,t1_fcvkykm,1578006538.0,Not trying to be inflammatory here since I dont have a much knowledge about how this works.  But isn't that the point of having different threat levels? Once the species makes a decent recovery you can scale back protections on it since it can survive much better on it's own now? Obviously you keep some things the same like the ban on DDT and such. But we shouldn't have to spend as much tracking and studying each family to make sure they are ok anymore. A scale back doesn't have to mean abandonment. Just more appropriate spending for their risk level.
