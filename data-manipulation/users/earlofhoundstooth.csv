AskReddit,feaw2v7,t1_fearpfo,1578952770.0,"The thing is, the pay isn't bad over a lifetime. My grandma was on teacher's retirement insurance for something over 40-45 years. Also, got a pension for that time. 

The thing is, it is backloaded pay. That is why teachers VALIDLY say they don't make the money their peers in other occupations make and administrators and legislators say holy crap this is expensive and only getting worse as people live longer. If I do the same job as my mom and grandma for 20 years and mom lives a couple years longer than grandma and I outlive grandma by 5 years it costs more for me. Health care is going up 3.9% annually, not keeping pace with inflation at 1.7 US stats. Premiums go up to match.

It is a case of both sides having some very valid points."

Nothing happens. People who talked to HR about problems are fired. Fucking fucks!
