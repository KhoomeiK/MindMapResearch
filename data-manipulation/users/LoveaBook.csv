You’re right. But the fact that he would never cry off no matter how hard things got was also part of the reason he was chosen. And I did read it, I know the beams were saved after the battle. But Roland was not being called by the Beams, he was being called by the Tower. And again, why was it necessary to be delayed across centuries? Why couldn’t he save the Beams in his time? Whatever forces are pulling him towards the Tower are also lifting him out of time here and there. WHY?? So it could be some perfect for Hollywood shit where they defuse the bomb in the last second?

Also, why were the others trying to break the beams? His friend said he helped because it feels so good to do it, but what were his “employers” motivations for breaking them? It is explained that the Tower is the nexus of all universes. Wouldn’t bringing it down result in non-existence?

Again, I’m glad you like the ending. But can you find the answers to my questions - questions King wanted to raise with his readers in the early books - anywhere in the ending?

(Btw, where did you get the feeling Roland wasn’t supposed to enter the Tower? All his dreams leading up to it, the reception he received at it’s base, all seem to indicate the Tower wanted him to enter it.)

This angered me for a long time, too. Then, one day, I realized I DIDN’T HAVE TO carry that shame and guilt anymore if I didn’t want to. In fact, one of the best tricks abusers have is to get their victim to carry the shame and guilt that is rightfully theirs. But you have to remember - repeat this to yourself often - that it is NOT your shame/guilt to carry. Set down those heavy-ass bags and let someone else carry them. It’s incredibly freeing when you realize that you can drop those bags. But like most things, this is all much easier to say than to do. But if you can absorb just this one fact - IT IS NOT YOUR SHAME TO CARRY - you will be light years ahead of where most of us were when we started therapy.

It is not your shame to carry. You do not need to hide that this happened to you anymore. This protects the abuser at the expense of your soul. You can talk about who/what happened. You can confide in friends about what was done to you. Of course, you needn’t do ANY of these things. My point is that feeling like you need to keep your abuse secret only fuels that shame and guilt. This doesn’t mean to tell everyone and anyone you’ve ever met, it simply means that you don’t need to hide it anymore."
books,ffjpc5u,t1_ffhu1wt,1580003581.0,"I’m not saying that the ending comes out of nowhere. Of course it has themes that continue through, but it leaves too many of the most important ideas, themes and questions completely unanswered. And the full ending, after the Gunslinger gets inside the Tower, is lame and pointless.

SPOILERS       SPOILERS        SPOILERS!!!

So, Roland has been called through destiny to reach the tower. When he gets inside it he sees scenes of his life playing out in the different rooms. Why? He lived his life. He knows what happened. Why is it so important for the tower to show him what he’s already lived? I mean, we already know the Tower is aware of him, is watching him, or it wouldn’t have called him to it. Why was it important that Roland walk across the centuries to get there only JUST in time to save the Beams? Why not let him get there in his own century? What was the point of going in to the Tower? What would Roland have to change (besides bringing the horn) for the Tower to allow him to end his quest? And when he does finally fulfill these unwritten rules, what will the inside of the Tower be like then? What will happen to Roland, and what will he see, when he reaches the final door in the Tower on his final run-through? Who’s directing the forces that are guiding his destiny? Why has it taken hundreds, if not thousands, of attempts for Roland to satisfy these unwritten rules of his quest?

Also, I’m pretty sure when Walter says that line, “Death, but not for you Gunslinger” he was referring to the fact that Roland was going to start walking across centuries. After all, Susannah didn’t die. The Artist didn’t die.

I’m glad you’re pleased with the ending and that you find it satisfactorily wraps up the questions and themes of the story, but personally I find it lacking. As Steven King has said in criticizing other such endings, it doesn’t feel true to what has come before. Ending a book is not the same thing as finishing a story. This ending does not feel true to all that came before and it most certainly does NOT Finish the story."

books,ffhi42a,t1_ffherwn,1579936258.0,"That’s me saying he started off hot with a good idea in the first several books, but obviously had no idea how to end it. When he came back to finish it 20-some-odd years later I was thrilled - until I read them. Now, don’t get me wrong, they’re not bad books at all. They’re just also not written with the same passion as the earlier novels and so the characters and plot get a bit thin at times. And the end, fuck me, don’t get me started on the fucking ending!

In the end, while the final three books do see our hero reaching his goal - The Dark Tower - at last, King still obviously had no idea WHAT the Tower actually was, WHY the Gunslinger had to be the one to get to it, why this was significant, what the Tower contained, etc. He spends the first four novels building the world and rules of the story; raising the sorts of questions that make a reader look forward to the climax with a barely contained excitement and anticipation. But sadly, King 25 years later couldn’t answer those questions any better than King 25 years ago. In the end he simply sidesteps most of them. Nothing gets tied up. Nothing is answered. I’m a King fan, so I don’t need it to be a happy, good-defeats-evil ending, but I do expect the ending to tie the loose threads of the story together in a way that stays true to all the story that came before. Sadly, King’s ending for The Dark Tower series falls completely flat.

It was an interesting story with very diverse characters. The first four books are some of his best works and I highly recommend them, but I still consider the story to be unfinished, and have had to accept that I will never see the end King was originally working towards."

You need a specialized trauma recovery program, or someone who is trained in treating PTSD.

And sometimes it takes awhile to find the right therapist; you have to shop around.

Find someone who’s trained in trauma and who you’d like as a friend if you met them elsewhere. That [has been found](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/10/psychotherapy-childhood-mental-health) to be an important factor in therapeutic success.

If you can keep going you will pass out of this. Sometimes it takes awhile, but that’s ok. It takes as long as it needs to. Your abuse happened over time, the healing from it will need time, too.

And you know what, sometimes it’s ok to not have this. This is tough shit, in a highly triggering world. Sometimes we CAN’T cope well for a little bit, but that’s ok, too.

atheism,ffgts6v,t3_et9x6h,1579914862.0,"I actually said something about this in two different situations. It wasn’t especially well received.

The first time I was in one of my regular knit/crochet groups and some of the older ladies started talking about a friend who had just died. As part of this they were talking about how horrible the majority of her life was, as her husband of 50 years was an exceptionally violent and abusive man. They talked about some of the broken bones she’d had over the years, the many hospital stays she’d had, etc. (Oh, and apparently this woman was super religious, too.) Finally, one of the women said something like, “Well, thankfully her husband died 5 years ago, so God gave her 5 years of peace before she died.” Normally when people say that shit I just let it go because I know they’re saying it as a way of self-soothing their grief. But they’d just spent 10 minutes talking about how horrific life with her husband was and ending it in that BS pithy way pissed me off. So the conversation ended with, “...God gave her 5 years of peace...” to which I immediately, and granted, perhaps a little too vehemently responded with, “**GOD** gave her 50 years of HELL!!”

Wooooh, if looks could kill!

The next time I openly challenged someone like this was in therapy. My (ex)therapist was really religious and often said the whole “God has a plan” and “God works in mysterious ways” BS. One day I had enough and told her I that her saying stuff like that not only offended me but really pissed me off. I told her I was an atheist and to please keep God out of our sessions. I ended by saying that even it I weren’t an atheist I wouldn’t worship any diety whose “plans” intentionally required an 8/9 year old girl to be repeatedly raped, starved and otherwise abused.

After that she was nearly silent in our sessions, except for the occasional slip-up about “God’s Plans”. It wasn’t that I’d pissed her off, it was more like I’d emptied her toolbox and she just had nothing else left to use. She was a super kind woman who really tried to help - which is why I stayed with her long enough to tell her this - but it was like she’d received her psych degree from a seminary."
