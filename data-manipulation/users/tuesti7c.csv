shoptitans,fez9b12,t3_eqa68b,1579455037.0,I like variety but at some point you have to hire more ninjas and spell blades. You will get to a point where everyone cant get anymore exp and you will see some heroes are straight better than others. Basically re roll the weaker ones when you see fit but only re level one or two at time so you dont get too weak.

We used to get 100 200 or 250$ per month based on meeting and or exceeding your numbers. If you got a bonus all 3 months of a quarter, regardless of level, whatever you had combined was doubled (IE 250+250+250=750 so on third month you would get an extra 1k)
