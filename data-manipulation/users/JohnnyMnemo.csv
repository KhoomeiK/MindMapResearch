I'd be interested in you expanding on this thought, because I don't understand it:

>I don't believe God is so terrible that he would yank someone family away just because they are a little silly.

Does that mean that if God does yank someone's family away that they deserved it?  If you don't think that God is petty, I think that it follows that that God is deliberate.

Since clearly people are orphaned, do you conclude that they were orphaned for a reason?

I don't think that anyone is orphaned for any particular reason, either for petty ones or legit ones.  I think the world is more capricious than that, but it sounds like you have a different world view.

This question is fundamental to the philosophical *Problem of Evil*, in which it's questioned how a good God can allow any evil tragedies to exist.  Since tragedies clearly exist, it follows that God takes a certain position on those events, none of which appear to be congruent with a loving Christian God.

Of the 7 books, it's amongst the worst written as well.  I think by that point Lewis had gotten so caught up with his allegory and moralizing that he laid it on really thick and lost the thread of the plot.

That's what so fascinating about it, and why more than one person has commented on her fate.

It's so needlessly moralistic, and out of place from the rest of the story, so capricious, and out of place of CS Lewis' established narrative voice, that's it's *really* striking that Lewis felt so vindictive that he needed to do a hit job on her.

Edmund's fall, and return to grace, is given 1000s of words and treated with sympathy.  But that bitch Susan puts on a little lipstick and she's cut off from Heaven in about 3 sentences?  It seems like a really personal attack.  Was Lewis trying to tell the real life character of Lucy something?  Was he commenting as Lewis on the real life model of Susan?  Was he particularly contemptuous of female wantons that he felt like he needed to stick this point, in a frankly misogynistic way?  Did he only value the infantile innocence of female children, and once they dared to grow into adults with adult needs had no more space for them in the Kingdom of Heaven?  Is there any example of a adult woman that is treated with sympathy by Lewis?  I can only think of Digory's mother, who, of course, was deathly ill.

Lewis clearly felt really strongly about it, enough to betray himself, and it really undermines almost the entirety of his story.  You're ok with god as long as you're a man?  You're good with god unless you're boy crazy?  He suggests that all will be forgiven *unless* you're boy crazy *in which case* you're dropped right off the cliff from God's plan, and fuck you.

You'd practically have to have two cleaning costs and charge the higher rate if the guest doesn't abide by the request.  

The beauty of AirBnB is that it allows owners with extra space to monetize that and charge less than hotels.  But you're still very much competing agains hotels in terms of cost/service/location, and if gets marginally out of whack I just go with the standard option.

I mean, great that your acq can set that expectation and have it respected.  Maybe I'm the outlier.  And honestly if I remembered I'd probably comply too.  But I wouldn't accept it as standard practice or habit either."

If the host isn't able to provide hospitality services, they shouldn't be renting their place out on a hospitality website."

In practice, no.  This is how you get eugenics laws.  When we can't even produce race-blind voting systems, we're not going to be able to produce race-blind child competency exams either."
