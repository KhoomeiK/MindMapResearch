And then you'd have to disregard the fact that hierarchy of the position was a matter of active debate between city hall and the council and this structure was unilaterally decided by the Mayor. 

If you want to implement transparency and accountability in government, you don't usurp the democratic process this way. If you just want to pay lip service to it then it was a very clever way to go about getting the desired end result. 

Your whole argument also ignores the supposed independence of those positions from city hall influence which is expected I guess given how disingenuous you approached the issue."
politics,fee1vmx,t1_fee1po0,1579024664.0,Nice. It's just an unrepresented america that can't vote for president and doesn't pay federal income tax outside of government employees and normal foreign earnings. I guess burying your head in the sand on the nuances is working for you though.

politics,fedx0ms,t1_fedvyto,1579021680.0,"I don't think it's a fault issue but rather a fact issue. If you are retaining federal income tax funds and federal income tax funds infrastructure in the states, those that retain the funds are responsible for infrastructure maintenance and improvement?"
politics,fedvwta,t1_fedv5bz,1579021011.0,"Thats a non answer to the question but regardless. Mississippi is actually 37th for federal income tax contributions:) I was surprised too. Vermont is surprisingly last on a total [rather than per capita] basis. See below. Puerto rico would be 51st for 2018, you can wiki that.

politics,fedukxr,t3_eokast,1579020215.0,"I know this sub isn't big on fact based discussion, but if only 1/5th of the territory pays federal income tax and federal income tax is what funds infrastructure, would it not make sense that it would fall on puerto rico to fund local infrastructure moreso than the federal government? This notwithstanding their 70 billionish outstanding debt."
