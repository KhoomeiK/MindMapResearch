AskReddit,ffp52mi,t3_eu725g,1580086397.0,"Freaky. I was a new mom with a 6 month old. The radio alarm came on with the news so the attack was the first thing I heard that morning. 

I spent the day crying and watching news coverage. I went to see if I could buy a flag that week but they all were gone. I had to make my own. I still have it in a box. I guess I had to feel like I was doing something to help. 

The skies were silent. No planes. Kia was running an ad for cars buy one get one free! Wtf! We all felt like Americans instead of separate groups. Except for Muslims. They got enemy treatment. So there were also lots of warnings not to go out and hurt Muslims. But the crazies attacked people in turbans. That meant Sikhs were getting beat up.

There was a lot of TV coverage of little kids asking why ""they"" hate our freedoms and how we never did anything to ""them."" Our shenanigans in the Middle East were completely ignored. If you even suggested America was anything other than a completely innocent party you were supporting the enemy.

People were looking out for anthrax in the mail. 

Then we went to war in Iraq, which made no sense at all.

It was definitely a weird time."
