facebookwins,ffs3ion,t3_eul4cl,1580172233.0,Hitting creates submission. I really wouldn’t want my so. Growing up being submissive.  I’ve raised him up to be an independent thinker.  Ie. I never hit my child.

AnimalsBeingDerps,fez7p1i,t1_fey29eg,1579454543.0,"Flashback 20+ years. 
A relative gave my son a small turtle in a very small travel container.  5 bucks at flea market. Great deal, right?
That led to...10 gal aquarium and rocks..and flat rocks..and warming lamp....
Then it needed a friend. Another $5 flea market buy....
Then one died.  Gave the other way. Stored the aquarium for several years.

Repeat a few years later.  2 new turtles.  10 gal...and then to a 15-20 gal tank.  More flat rocks, tiered so they could crawl to top to dry.  
By this point, who needed to clean the nasty poopy rocks and water?  Me.  Mom.  
They got to about 5-6”.  So triple their cute size.  But, now not as cute. Interesting to watch.  Until it wasn’t.
Gave everything away to a new “family”.... 2 aquariums, lots of rocks, heating lamp, etc plus TWO not so little turtles.

 Since then the ONLY pets to step into our house are golden retrievers.  I can handle that."
