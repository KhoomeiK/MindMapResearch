The numbers of teens having sex are plunging, down to below half (and that's generous, I think it's closer to 1/3 or even 1/4, depending on your community). I myself lost my virginity at 20 years old, almost 21, and I was still (according to my doctor) within a few standard deviations of the mean. So you've got time, especially if you haven't felt those feelings for anyone yet. You've also got options because there's tons of middle ground between ""prude"" and losing your virginity (which is itself really subjective). A resource I'd recommend is ScarletTeen. It's a website with tons of factual and handy advice for teens (and adults honestly)."

It was a faux pas for sure, even if I was legally in the clear. Now that I am teaching full time, if I were to not be renewed and were job searching, I might still tell people I'm a teacher but I'd likely go back to subbing while job searching.

Teachers,fe08qv2,t1_fe042tw,1578806176.0,"You can get a Master's at any time. In my district, tenure doesn't happen until after 3 years and the networking/seniority varies by school.

It gave me a chance to network as well but I don't have tenure or seniority yet.

Edit: I missed that you're pursuing a Master's in STEM, not education. Mine was in education and mostly online.
