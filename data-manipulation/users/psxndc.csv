politics,ff776bw,t1_ff74jbt,1579642463.0,"I'm basing it on my experiences with getting municipal parking signs for when I moved, getting partial pay for when I went on paternity leave, and trying to get my marriage license.

Parking signs: paid for them, no one put them up until the night before the trucks came. They're supposed to be out 3 days beforehand to ensure people have enough warning to not park there. If the signs are removed by random person, the city says ""too bad, no refund"" and because there was no number to call, I had no idea if they were put out and removed or just never put up. Just unnecessary stress and red tape, with no accountability on the city's part.

When I went on paternity leave, I got partial pay from the state. I filled out all the forms (which were confusing) and submitted them. Two months later, I get a letter saying my request was denied because I filled out a form wrong. Called the number. Wait to speak to someone was going to be an hour. Left my number with the automated system. No call back. Called again the next day. Same thing: hour plus wait, left my number, no call back. Called the next day, stayed on hold for an hour and a half. Finally spoke to someone. They walked me through the issue, we resolved that, but said I made my claim for payment for Monday through Friday, but since I went back to work on Monday, I could claim Monday through Sunday. I said ""... Ok. You do this every day, so if that's the case, make that change."" A month later I get a check and we're all good. Except two months later I get a letter saying the state overpayed my paternity leave by two days; I'm only supposed to get Monday through Friday and I have 10 days to send them a letter providing a basis for saying I wasn't trying to defraud the government plus I will have to pay the overage back. Jesus. So I luckily had saved every form I submitted and I put together a whole letter laying out how I *had* asked for only Monday through Friday and it was a state employee that told me it was Monday to Sunday according to the state's policy. I submitted that (without paying anything back) and I never heard back. I have no idea if there is a ticker somewhere racking up interest on the supposed overpayment or if the matter is actually resolved. That was six months ago.

Getting my marriage license: my soon to be wife's last name is O'Something. We fill out the forms, wait in line at the county register for literally two and a half hours. We get to the window and they ask for our paperwork and our licenses. Clerk: ""Oh sorry, your license says your name is OSomething, not O'Something but the form you filled out says O'Something. They need to match. Can't help you. You'll have to fill out the forms again."" Wife: ""But government computers just drop the apostrophe. There isn't a way to get O'Something on my license."" Clerk: ""sorry, they don't match. Can't help you unless you have something official saying your name is O'Something."" Luckily my wife happened to have an order of divorce showing her name was changed from her former married name to O'Something, but like, COME ON. The alternative would have been too fill out the form again and wait in line, again. And of course because it's the government, we had to take time off from work for this because they aren't open on weekends/late.

This is why I don't trust the government to run something like healthcare. The amount of red tape, effort expended on my part to get anything done, and zero fucks/accountability of the government are bad enough as is and would probably be even worse if healthcare were added."

politics,ff718y5,t1_ff6xmi1,1579639109.0,"Honestly, still trying to figure it out. But in current order:

I like Pete. I think an incremental approach to healthcare is better than trying to get M4A at the outset (sorry, my experiences with government agencies don't give me much faith that the government can effectively manage healthcare). I like that he's served in the military and I appreciate his faith. I think he's got a massive problem with black voters though and I don't know how he'll overcome that.

I like Warren, or at least 2014 Warren. I spent a lot of time in MA, so I read her book right after she was elected and got the sense that she was very much for the ""average"" American.

Which I get Bernie is too. It's not that I'm opposed to Bernie actually, he's just kinda ok in my book and, if I'm being honest, I'm concerned about his health. That's probably the big differentiator between him and Warren in my book.

Yang has some interesting ideas and I feel like they are data-driven/supported, but I also think they are so out there that most people won't consider them.

Klobuchar is sorta eh, but her stock is on the rise to me. I appreciate her incremental and pragmatic approach. I'd pick her over Biden probably.

As for how noticable, I didn't think Invisalign was that noticeable because I don't open my mouth all the time, and even when I do, my mouth isn't really ""gummy""; you only see the bottom of my teeth and Invisalign isn't that noticable based on that.

interestingasfuck,ff4as3b,t1_ff46j57,1579559278.0,"Basically what you'd imagine. 20 years after braces and not wearing a retainer, my teeth had shifted.

Mouth still ached as teeth moved, but no more cut up lips and it was a lot less noticeable to other people. Even now I'm supposed to wear my retainer tray but rarely do. I can get by by popping it in every night for a week every couple months. 

The only thing I'd recommend is finding someone you like to do it, because if you go anywhere else, the second orthodontist will want to start all over. In my case the second ortho (I moved, so going to the original was a pain) viewed it as ""not my diagnosis, so I don't want to continue their treatment plan.""

politics,ff776bw,t1_ff74jbt,1579642463.0,"I'm basing it on my experiences with getting municipal parking signs for when I moved, getting partial pay for when I went on paternity leave, and trying to get my marriage license.

Parking signs: paid for them, no one put them up until the night before the trucks came. They're supposed to be out 3 days beforehand to ensure people have enough warning to not park there. If the signs are removed by random person, the city says ""too bad, no refund"" and because there was no number to call, I had no idea if they were put out and removed or just never put up. Just unnecessary stress and red tape, with no accountability on the city's part.

When I went on paternity leave, I got partial pay from the state. I filled out all the forms (which were confusing) and submitted them. Two months later, I get a letter saying my request was denied because I filled out a form wrong. Called the number. Wait to speak to someone was going to be an hour. Left my number with the automated system. No call back. Called again the next day. Same thing: hour plus wait, left my number, no call back. Called the next day, stayed on hold for an hour and a half. Finally spoke to someone. They walked me through the issue, we resolved that, but said I made my claim for payment for Monday through Friday, but since I went back to work on Monday, I could claim Monday through Sunday. I said ""... Ok. You do this every day, so if that's the case, make that change."" A month later I get a check and we're all good. Except two months later I get a letter saying the state overpayed my paternity leave by two days; I'm only supposed to get Monday through Friday and I have 10 days to send them a letter providing a basis for saying I wasn't trying to defraud the government plus I will have to pay the overage back. Jesus. So I luckily had saved every form I submitted and I put together a whole letter laying out how I *had* asked for only Monday through Friday and it was a state employee that told me it was Monday to Sunday according to the state's policy. I submitted that (without paying anything back) and I never heard back. I have no idea if there is a ticker somewhere racking up interest on the supposed overpayment or if the matter is actually resolved. That was six months ago.

Getting my marriage license: my soon to be wife's last name is O'Something. We fill out the forms, wait in line at the county register for literally two and a half hours. We get to the window and they ask for our paperwork and our licenses. Clerk: ""Oh sorry, your license says your name is OSomething, not O'Something but the form you filled out says O'Something. They need to match. Can't help you. You'll have to fill out the forms again."" Wife: ""But government computers just drop the apostrophe. There isn't a way to get O'Something on my license."" Clerk: ""sorry, they don't match. Can't help you unless you have something official saying your name is O'Something."" Luckily my wife happened to have an order of divorce showing her name was changed from her former married name to O'Something, but like, COME ON. The alternative would have been too fill out the form again and wait in line, again. And of course because it's the government, we had to take time off from work for this because they aren't open on weekends/late.

This is why I don't trust the government to run something like healthcare. The amount of red tape, effort expended on my part to get anything done, and zero fucks/accountability of the government are bad enough as is and would probably be even worse if healthcare were added."

politics,ff718y5,t1_ff6xmi1,1579639109.0,"Honestly, still trying to figure it out. But in current order:

I like Pete. I think an incremental approach to healthcare is better than trying to get M4A at the outset (sorry, my experiences with government agencies don't give me much faith that the government can effectively manage healthcare). I like that he's served in the military and I appreciate his faith. I think he's got a massive problem with black voters though and I don't know how he'll overcome that.

I like Warren, or at least 2014 Warren. I spent a lot of time in MA, so I read her book right after she was elected and got the sense that she was very much for the ""average"" American.

Which I get Bernie is too. It's not that I'm opposed to Bernie actually, he's just kinda ok in my book and, if I'm being honest, I'm concerned about his health. That's probably the big differentiator between him and Warren in my book.

Yang has some interesting ideas and I feel like they are data-driven/supported, but I also think they are so out there that most people won't consider them.

Klobuchar is sorta eh, but her stock is on the rise to me. I appreciate her incremental and pragmatic approach. I'd pick her over Biden probably.

Do you think ""the left"" and ""Americans"" are different? Your answer implies they are. There's the ""left"" on one side that care about his tactics and on the other side is Trump supporters and Americans, who care about results. Is that the way you see it?

As in ""we're really charging you 6k for advice between the investments and fee because if we offered a 6k flat rate, no one would take it."" 

If I were to move the IRA and Roth and managed them myself, she has implied that our relationship wouldn't continue (because, in effect, I'd be paying her 2k for 6k's ""worth"" of advice). What're your thoughts on this? Again, I'd hate to lose her overall services, but that 1.x% fee is going to result in literally hundreds of thousands of dollars by the time I retire."
AskTrumpSupporters,feaynvs,t1_feawnb0,1578953604.0,"Why do you think that's strange to bring up? If the point is ""we only want 'high quality' immigrants,"" then why put up with 'low quality' natives? Aren't low quality natives just as much a drain on the system as low quality immigrants? Literally the only reason people are citizens is because they are born here; they didn't earn it or anything. And people on the right aren't in favor of birthright citizenship, so why is it surprising that I don't understand why low quality natives get a pass?"

IWantToLearn,fdtzrxm,t1_fdr7drz,1578724963.0,"So one other resource is something like Didi Hirsch. https://didihirsch.org/

Granted that's very LA specific, but there might be a similar organization in your county/state/country. Try searching for ""low income mental health [your locale]"" and that might yield relevant results. As someone else said, not every therapist is going to be a great match. I've certainly had at least one that was flat out not for me. But over the course of my life, I've seen three different ones and have learned a lot from each. Try a couple if the first one doesn't take."

I say try setting up an appointment and let *the therapist* tell you that they can't help you."
IWantToLearn,fdr5lxa,t1_fdr4qli,1578679773.0,"First, no need to ""ask for a friend"" if it's for you. Getting therapy shouldn't be stigmatized; if anything it should be applauded. You're recognizing you have an issue and you're having the courage and maturity to try and fix it.

If you're employed by largish company, they may have a program called EAP which would get you usually 5ish sessions for free.

Alternatively, you could look around for therapists that having a sliding scale for fees. That means they take your income into account in terms of how much they charge. 

And if you're in dire straights, your county/state's department of mental health may be able to get you therapy for free.

I'll poke around and try to post some resources later today."
IWantToLearn,fdr04vr,t1_fdqwg5h,1578677767.0,"I'll second this. Therapy is fantastic.

On the friend thing, is there something (sports, hobbies) you're good at that could have a social aspect? Using my softball example, if you're good at softball, join a team. You'll provide value to the team, which may incentivize teammates to value you and approach you in terms of getting to know more about you. That may mitigate your inability to reach out yourself.  I used sports, but the same applies for any hobby you have expertise in where you'd be around others.

As for how to socialize, for what it's worth, it's hard. I've never felt comfortable with people until I've really gotten to know them (see my comment about smalltalk). Even today, established in my career and 1000% comfy in my life overall, I feel like an idiot and a fraud talking to most people. Like I'm just constantly faking it. But I know that about myself and I'm ok with it. The best advice I can offer is find people with similar interests (Meetup.com?), join them, and just practice. Having a common interest is a great conversation starter."

I've seen you make this comment before. Why are you so certain that this will happen and what if it doesn't? Will the media then gain some credibility in your eyes?"
IWantToLearn,fdqqs0c,t3_emsrho,1578672876.0,"The title sounds different than the request. The title sounds like you are having trouble making friends as an adult, a very common problem for people with full time jobs and little free time. That could be solved by joining a co-ed sports league or something similar. A group activity, on a weekly basis, over time, will expose you to different people, some of which you might have things in common, which will likely yield at least one friendship.

The rest of the post though makes it sound like you have trouble forming deep friendships entirely and have had this problem your whole life. That's a different issue/request. On that front, what do you think has held you back? Are you not forthcoming when people engage you? Do you just not care about what other people are interested in or their opinions on things? I ask those questions without judgment, I'm just trying to discern the issue. I'll share that I often don't care about people's ""surface"" opinions - I HATE smalltalk - but once I've spent more time with people, I'm genuinely interested in their deeper feelings about things."

politics,fdpu908,t1_fdpqki2,1578640709.0,"OP said ""if Biden or Pete are nominated, it's a one party system."" That's what I took exception to. I never, ever, advocated for any one candidate or for a centrist position. Maybe learn to read and rub two nuerons together before you respond and accuse me of anything. I don't feel attacked, but you are accusing me of pushing centrism, and I'm not. If the party chooses Bernie, I'm 100% on board. If the party chooses Warren, I'm 100% on board. If the party chooses Gabbard (who for the record, I think sucks eggs - she was cited because even if she's pushed by fascists, she still is not Trump), I'm 100% on board.

I get that you don't like Joe or Pete. That's fine, never objected to that. Are you telling me they are the *same thing* as Trump? Really? Because that's what we're talking about here and that's some dishonest bullshit. They aren't the same, in any objective way. 

And if they *are* the nominee - centrists or not - everyone here that hates them better get on board too because Trump's supporters are showing up on election day and if we don't unite behind whoever the candidate is, then it's 4 more years of Trump."
