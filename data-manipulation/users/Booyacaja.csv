PSVR,fermbx4,t3_eqavn3,1579355719.0,"Just sharing my tips from another thread that seemed to be well received. For the noobs picking this up. Definitely one of my favourite VR experiences so far. 

Quick tips:

 1. Practice blocking. Find an basic asshole on the first deck and practice blocking like 50 times until you have it down to a science.

 2. Watch out for the dickheads with guns. I had the most trouble with them since you die really quickly and they have good aim and range. Just sneak up on them and stem cell them in the neck or valkyrie them silently from a distance. 

 3. Ivy serum is amazing. Especially if you can ivy a bloodhound (electric looking assholes) or a weeper chick. You stab them with the syringe and they become your friend until they die. Really fun and easy to use. Berserkers are alright too. 

 4. Upgrade your favorite weapons so you can have more ammo/uses and higher powered power ups. I like the baton (electrified when fully upgraded), valkyrie, ivy serum and rage serum mainly. I beat the game stocking up on that for the most part. 

 5. Loot everything. There's so much money and stem cells to find. You'll need it. 

 6. Use the super sense or whatever it's called. Especially useful for the little sneaky fucks that try to jump scare you. This let's you spot them while they're hiding. Use it before entering every room. 

 7. Rage serum is your friend. You go berserk and can't die. Upgrade this early. Especially useful near the end. 

 8. When you die, take the time to upgrade yourself with stem cells. I focused mostly on health to start but try to have a balanced character. 

 9. Do the supply drops if you can (I think that's what they're called?). There's one on each deck. I only realized late in the game these existed. You get sick loot and, once you get it, it also gives you portal access to that deck so you don't always have to start at deck 1 like a sucker. 

 10. The weeper can be a bitch, but once you know how to block her, she's easy. Lure her over, wait for her to scream and then block her bad breath attack. After her attack she'll be staggered a few moments and you can bash her with the stem cell in the face. 

 11. I stay away from 2 handed weapons since blocking is just too useful. 

 12. Use the map. You can quickly get where you need to go if you use it well. 

 13. Medical rooms are a lifesaver. 

 14. Things like time slowing and invisibility I barely used. Didn't find them useful personally. I'd spend my upgrade tokens elsewhere. 

 15. It's pretty easy to get good at sneaking without alerting the enemy. They're pretty dumb. You can usually clear a room or sneak past entirely without even causing a fuss. 

 16. Look through the window before opening the door. It's saved my life many times. Most of the dummies can't open the doors so have an escape plan in mind. 

 17. Drone grenades were my grenade of choice. When fully upgraded I think you can launch 4 waves at once. It's pretty funny to watch them go. You can clear a whole room pretty easily. 

 18. A swift stem cell bash to the face is often enough for basic enemies. Don't waste your precious ammo. 

 19. At the beginning, don't buy too much stuff at once, because you will die and lose it all. Buy just enough to get you to the next objective. Unless you think you're at that point where you're going to go on a run. 

 20. Use deck 1 to craft all your weapons and items. It's the easiest one with the weakest enemies and you'll often have all machines you need on the same deck. Just bounce around from machine to machine once you're ready to stock up. 

 21. Upgrade your teleporter as it's useful af when trying to escape an enemy quickly (since you can't sprint).

 22. Don't get frustrated when you die. See it as an opportunity to upgrade and come back stronger. Head to deck one, get some easy loot and recraft a better setup to do better next time."

todayilearned,fe5zq0d,t3_envw3m,1578878546.0,"Unpopular opinion alert: The suicidal guy is eating a lot of shit in this thread. I don't know the whole story, so I'm not here to defend his actions, but as someone who was personally touched by someone who attempted suicide, I can definitely tell you they are not in a normal state of mind and are not themselves when they are committing the act. So, while he did cause a large amount of hurt to hundreds of people and their families, it surely was not his intention to do so, though that doesn't make it right, I know. They say when someone is suicidal, it's like they are looking at life through a straw (tunnel vision) and the only way to make the pain go away is to end themselves. Unfortunately this particular attempt resulted in an actual train wreck which is terrible. I agree with those saying he should have left his car out of it, but I just wanted to chime in here because I've seen first hand how depression can completely scramble someone's brains."
