AskReddit,ff5wcyp,t3_ergjyj,1579612462.0,"When a creepy man was eyeballing my very young and beautiful female employee. I was a supervisor at the time and I heard him whistle at her, but didn't see it. Since I didn't see it I couldn't do much as I don't have access to the tapes, but I stood in his line of sight and kept asking him if he needed anything while he tried to look around me and gawk. She's way too nonconfrontational to stand up for herself but is the sweetest girl, and it boiled my blood to see her treated like that."

Baking,fepec9g,t3_eqaubs,1579318400.0,I actually like the rough look when cakes are baked in a shaped pan and just dusted. Reminds me of simple family dinners and lazy Sundays.
watchpeoplesurvive,feo2u8p,t3_epzwh0,1579294363.0,These people are fucking stupid and got so many warnings. They're very lucky that it just wanted to play.
AskReddit,fenwmba,t3_eq1wzh,1579291961.0,A call offering me a job at the place I most recently applied to. My current one is degrading my mental health and I'm not sure how much longer I can take it.
EatCheapAndHealthy,femw5mh,t3_epnlsc,1579271186.0,"I realized the other day when buying ginger that brands can be drastically different. The tiny mccormick bottle was the samenprice as a ""premium"" brand whose bottle has twice the amount and was fancier looking. They know people buy blindly because of brand loyalty and take advantage of that."

AskReddit,febjape,t3_eo6l00,1578959389.0,"During senior's week, all the dudes came in wearing extremely short shorts and those tank tops that are barely shirts. So much man thigh was had that day. And detentions."

gaming,fdutfvv,t3_en4t17,1578738553.0,I vaguely remember a VR chat video where it's obvious from the person's movements they're having a seizure. Some scary stuff that is. A friend of mine had a seizure disorder and she had to brief us on what to do and what not to do if she had an attack.

My baby boy Hiccup got his name because he kept sucking the formula down too fast and giving himself the Hiccups. He also used to suck on my finger while I held him like a baby and he'd fall asleep like that."

MadeMeSmile,fdjx0mq,t3_elnws6,1578490205.0,"I fully believe my mom reading Harry Potter to me when I was 4 is what helped me love books. Although even before that I would take all my toys out of my toy box, sit in it, and look at my picture books. Then in 3rd grade I had an amazing teacher that made it a point to read to us. If we were good, he'd take us outside to do it if it was nice weather.  I also remember there was a restriction on what age level books we were allowed to check out at the library in elementary, but I read too fast and they became too easy, so the librarian got my mom's permission to grant me an exception, and it was like a whole new world opened up. In high school I'd check out five books at a time and have them back in two weeks. Exposing kids to books really makes a difference in their lives growing up.

The thought of never having any of that is almost devastating."

I think more retirement homes should have built in daycares where the elderly can interact with little ones and play with them. Gives them a sense of purpose."

witcher,fcmuapj,t1_fcmqdkx,1577792605.0,"They summoned it from nothing, though. Like with the lightning, it was more like she redirected it. Before that you see the fire on the fort go out, because she absorbed and rereleased it. It's kinda implied she's special and that this is a very risky way to do magic."
witcher,fclxvlv,t1_fclm40u,1577759145.0,"Magic has a cost, and it makes sense for her to have picked up some sword prowess in her 30ish years tending to a king. These weren't terribly powerful adversaries, it didn't take much to cut them down."
aww,fcl163r,t3_ehmpo7,1577737566.0,That is a very beautiful and very well trained horse that must be used to this. I saw his nose boop the back leg and flinched a bit knowing how bad it would be if he spooked the horse.
aww,fckorrx,t3_ehldvi,1577729939.0,This is absolutely beautiful and if I were this little girl's mom and saw this I'd probably be bawling and treasure it forever. There's something really special about watercolors that gets me. I think it kinda reminds me of the artwork in the book Love You Forever. I loved that book as a kid and as an adult it makes me cry.
