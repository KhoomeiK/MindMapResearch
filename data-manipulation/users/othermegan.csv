tifu,fecv74u,t1_feavq7h,1578985916.0,Oh no. I don’t want to know but now I’ve been made aware.
AskReddit,fecu2st,t1_fecpk8v,1578984644.0,"Yup. Can’t say there were teen pregnancies in my family but my super catholic grandparents had 7 kids (more pregnancies but there were miscarriages). And my ultra catholic mother got married at 19 against a lot of arguments from her family saying she was too young. It took me 26 years but I finally realized my parents got married to have sex. 

Funnily enough, my generation of cousins are all significantly less religious and are getting married/procreating slowly at appropriate ages."
AskReddit,fectvle,t1_fecqd53,1578984418.0,Yup. Old Testament story about someone “spilling their seed.” It doesn’t seem to matter that girls don’t have seeds and female orgasms have nothing to do with live giving reproduction. “It’s still wrong”
AskReddit,fecru5b,t1_fecp22c,1578982214.0,Exactly my point!
AskReddit,fecrsyj,t1_fecpz44,1578982181.0,Which only further proves this girl’s stupidity. If you’re going to be a shopping cart Catholic then condoms seem like a good item to put in your basket
AskReddit,fecn341,t1_fecjixv,1578978031.0,Yes. But catholics also believe in no premarital sex. So if she really was catholic they wouldn't be doing it.

Spells out that OP isn't interested and never thought about hitting on her while also semi-fighting back over the shitty comment she made. It's the perfect balance of dishing back what you were given and not being an asshole."
AskReddit,fe9xlut,t1_fe70poz,1578942319.0,I could try. He is really good at giving me non-sexual intimacy. He just doesn’t understand that shower time will never be sexy time. It’s relax time. We don’t use hormonal birth control so shower sex doesn’t happen and the last thing I want post shower is to have sex while I’m (externally) wet and cold
AskReddit,fe6q9ck,t1_fe6eboc,1578900347.0,"I wish my showers with my SO could be like this. Most times I just want to relax and let the day wash away with good conversation, warm water, and good hugs. But he won’t stop taking it as an opportunity to try and make a move."
AskReddit,fe6q43t,t1_fe6af0t,1578900165.0,"Not the original comment but I have the same problem. My thing is, after working 6 7-hour days a week trying to get 15 adults to clean properly and do their jobs, the last thing I want to do is manage and train my boyfriend the way I do my employees."
lostgeneration,fe5f5bf,t1_fe33cb2,1578868726.0,"Oh boy... let me tell you about the surveys we've had over the past couple years. 

The first two surveys showed that out of everybody in our company, supervisors were the most disgruntled. The first 2 surveys also involved questions about whether or not compensation was fair. Supervisors are expected to do a step below manager level work for only a dollar above entry level positions. Most of us put 2 and 2 together. But HR decided the results meant we did need to praise employees more and put all supervisors on development plans to increase their sense of worth at work. 

We all fought back and said it was pay and benefits related. Either increase supervisor compensation or decrease their workload. We were ignored. 

The 3rd survey came out. It did not have compensation as a topic discussed. Those results were published. Everybody was still unhappy. Once again we tried to tell HR that it was a compensation issue. Their answer? ""Nobody even brought up compensation as an issue during this survey. It's not about the money."" I brought that information back to my team and they were pissed. They all wanted to talk about money and weren't given the chance. 

So the 4th survey in 3 years comes out and my employees decided that if the company wouldn't ask about compensation, they would use every comment box, regardless of topic, to say point blank ""I need higher wages, PTO, and/or benefits."" Those results were never published or discussed."
retailhell,fe5bi9r,t1_fe4wutl,1578867328.0,"Just because it's a customer doesn't mean it's not abuse. I make a point of telling all my new hires. ""We're in the service industry. People are going to get upset and part of our job is fixing that. However, that does not mean they get a free pass to abuse you and I will have you back in those scenarios."""
ibs,fe0fstu,t1_fdywv37,1578812701.0,"Went to the ER once. They did a cat scan then gave me an IV of water and whatever extra strong motrin they have. It went away so they sent me home with instructions to ""take more motrin if it comes back. return to the ER if it gets worse."" The next night it had triple. Swore I was dying. Went back to the ER. More scans, labs, ultrasounds, etc. More motrin (it didn't work this time). They sent me home saying nothing was wrong with me. 

After that it took me 2 doctors and a specialist to eventually get a ""diagnosis"" of ""well it's probably gastritis and ibs??? we don't know."" They put me on omeprezole and sucralfate for about 8 months until they said it wasn't safe to take that anymore and pulled me off everything. I gave up trying 2 years ago."
DeathByMillennial,fe0ewfx,t1_fe01oq9,1578812187.0,Very true. I hopefully have 20+ years and 2 siblings to help me sort through it. We’ll see. Maybe the houses will burn down or my parents will sell both and enter senior living. Too many hypotheticals to tell
DeathByMillennial,fe00w38,t1_fdzwzjr,1578800365.0,That’s really good info! But it’s not just about the debts and mortgages. It’s about the cost of gutting two houses and bringing them to a marketable quality.
TheMarvelousMrsMaisel,fe00oql,t1_fdz6mwo,1578800252.0,"No. I’m saying maybe she went to law school then never took the bar for unforeseen circumstances.

DeathByMillennial,fdxv6j7,t1_fdxb3e6,1578773248.0,"This exactly. My grandma died 10 years ago. My dad and uncles still have not settled up. My uncles have been unmarried and unemployed for 30+ years living in their mom’s house. When they die it will all go to my dad who will most likely not do anything with it due to depression.

I’m 100% planning on getting stuck with settling  3-4 estates when my parents die. If I go off their parents life span, it’ll be at least another 25-35 years. My dad already chose to retire when he got laid off. My mom can retire in 5 years. They had zero retirement funds and a mortgage. There will be nothing left to the inheritance my siblings and I get except old furniture that’s been rotting in a basement for 45 years and 2 moneypits they call houses. 

I will probably lose money when my family dies."
