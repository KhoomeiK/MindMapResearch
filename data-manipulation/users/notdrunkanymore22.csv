alcoholicsanonymous,ffi6e4n,t3_etrs67,1579966302.0,"I volunteer at and financially support a “no kill” animal shelter located near me.  If I miss any obligation there I feel guilty and bad, because the dogs there rely on me (and others).  They cannot help themselves, and require care and training to have better lives. They did not come there voluntarily, nor can they leave at will.   AA is not like that.  AA is a refuge for those (like me) who are beaten down by drink.   We come to learn how to live better lives.  We take what we need and give back what we can.  AA can get along fine without any of us - the question is “can you get along OK without AA”?     My sponsor recently celebrated his 37th AA birthday.   During the middle of his sobriety he went for 17 years and never attended a meeting.  He returned because he retired from his job, and an old friend needed help getting sober.    I have known many people over the years who have “corrected course” and gone on their way leaving AA and staying sober.  We are all different with regard to our needs.  In my case my character defects run deep and are stubborn.   Although sober 14 years I still must remain vigilant over my often funky motives.  I need the frequent reminder.  If you don’t more power to you.  You need to feel gratitude for AA being there, not guilt from parting ways."

Sub-Saharan women are different looking from women coming from West Africa.   Genes, regional diets, customs of dress and work all make their impact on our appearance.  Travel some or read more."
