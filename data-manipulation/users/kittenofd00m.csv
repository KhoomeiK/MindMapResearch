That's a bullshit excuse. Users can already search the web and their desktop and cloud (like OneDrive) by using the search feature right next to the Windows start button. 

> they can NOT add Microsoft Search in Google search 

Of course they can. Microsoft could easily work out a deal with Google that allowed MS to pass a query to Google and then display those results alongside local and cloud search results to the end user.

So I can steal your car and use it for a joy ride as long as I leave you instructions on where to find it when I'm done?

&#x200B;

> but saying that they steal anything is an overstatement 

I don't think so. I think they are attempting to steal searches from Google. If stealing searches from Google was not the point, why not just make a default search engine that gave the end user both Google results and local search results? 

All of the end users that I have spoken with about Windows 10's search that combines local and Bing web results say that it is confusing for them and they don;t want it. They want web searches to be web searches and file explorer to do local searches.

&#x200B;

> also, I can tell you that if they did the checkbox version (with the checkbox checked by default), most users would just click next and have Bing installed, so... 

I agree. But that would technically be their choice. This is not.

And what if Microsoft did this to ten 3rd party apps instead of one? What if they decided which default fonts you were to use, or that all of your apps would now save to a proprietary Microsoft file format by default?

They will do the same with you.

While your goals are admirable, your time is much too valuable to waste in this manner.

I would suggest starting an after school group for agnostics and let the curious join. 

Never directly attack another member's beliefs because that only makes you the enemy. Instead, encourage them to ask questions. And earnestly seek the answers together.

Most of the time, when discussing questions about religions' more magical aspects, the answer will be that there is no proof and no answer.

Leave it at that. You don't have to prove there is no god to someone questioning the premise, you just have to be there to listen and give them a safe space to ask the questions they are afraid to ask elsewhere. They will find the truth themselves.

Do not try to be their teacher. Do not try and drag them to the truth. Be their guide and friend who looks for the truth with them.

People generally are repulsed by people in direct relation to how overweight the other person is. 

However, overweight people are generally even nicer to other overweight people than they are to thinner people because they don't feel like they will be judged as harshly by another overweight person.

Being overweight also gives the impression that the overweight person is lazy and/or doesn't take good physical care of themselves. For many thinner people, those are definitely turn offs.

Like it or not, looks count for a LARGE part of how far you get in life. Better looking people get more offers, higher pay and are seen as more successful than even more educated or more capable overweight people.

Being overweight doesn't just hurt your health. It hurts your career, your earning potential, your available dating options, your access to other successful people and your chances of getting hired or elected to office.

Does that make the actions of thinner people towards overweight people right? No. But ignoring it or hoping that it will change is just wishful thinking. You are always better off trying to change yourself than trying to change others.
