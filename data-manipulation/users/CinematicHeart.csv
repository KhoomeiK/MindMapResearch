AmItheAsshole,ffsog0k,t3_ev0ogl,1580187077.0,Nta. Talk you your dad. Only his opinion is relevant and I doubt he cared as much as your mother.
Spiderman,ffpjau5,t3_eu8hhb,1580096389.0,I dont know if this has been mentioned but with the sign it probably comes down to weight. That foam place holder is a hell of a lot lighter and easier to handle then any prop that would have looked decent enough to use.
lgbt,ffmrvqi,t3_eu98mt,1580058295.0,"I am sorry that you are in this position. Are you 100% sure your parents will disown you? My thought is to live your life. You don't have to come out to everyone if you aren't there yet but that shouldn't stop you from dating and exploring. Build yourself the life you want and maybe one day you will be comfortable enough and feel strong enough to say ""this is who I am, take me or leave me"""

Blood counts crashed, his fever went up. To 105, he couldn't move his neck. It was pretty awful. He's been home since Monday and today you would never known he had been that sick."
insaneparents,ffe5c4u,t1_ffdnn7t,1579837105.0,Just spent a week in children's hospital with my 3 year old who has mono and was suspected to also have menigitis (mono can cause meningitis) I definitely recommend not fucking with either.
AskReddit,ffdk1g6,t1_ffdjllq,1579822524.0,I worked for a credit union. One of my coworkers who was like 18 got hooked on searching the Megan's law website for whatever reason. We had very little to do at work most days and I guess it was one of the sites that wasn't blocked. It was quite the shock when she found him. We also found a guy that hung out at the bar I did. I was asshole and printed his out and hung it on the cork board at the bar. Never seen him again either. I dont remember what he did though.
AskReddit,ffdiid1,t1_ffdic17,1579821587.0,They ended up quitting. It was a pedo thing. He tried to say she was 16 and he was 19 but someone found the details that said he was 20 and she was 14.
AskReddit,ffdi5zv,t1_ffdi3sm,1579821376.0,Do you mean what did they do?
AskReddit,ffdhyjx,t3_et18tc,1579821251.0,It didn't. It only changed my opinion of them especially when they down played what they did.

Advice,ff56ac7,t3_erphve,1579581442.0,You are only morally obligated to pay off the borrowed debt. She has zero legal standing here. If you pay her send it in check or money order and send certified mail so that she has to sign for it. Cut all ties and moved on. She's not worth your time.

AskReddit,ff4u28u,t3_ernakk,1579572453.0,"I was 16, my friends family invited me to go to NYC for the weekend with them it was just my friend, her mom, and her 18 year old brother. We all shared a room. My friend and I in one bed, mom and brother in the other. There was a small round table with chairs next to the side of the bed I was on. I woke up to her brother sitting all spread out just staring at me like I was a meat loaf. I pulled the cover over my head untill I felt him get up."

AskReddit,ff34z4t,t1_ff2sciy,1579533800.0,"I've had the opposite experience. I'm from Philadelphia and moved to a mountain town in PA for 5 years. I hated how unfriendly everyone was. Noone said hi to each other, and it was hard to engage in conversation with people in the town or cashiers. My husband who is from that area thinks it's weird that I say hi to everyone. It was so nice when we moved back to Philly and regained that sense of community."
