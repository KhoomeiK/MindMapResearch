for waypoints, i meant the way they flicker on and off as you wander through the dust. very frustrating. 

as for online, it was completely dead when i tried the game a few months ago. maybe getting further into the story will help me to access some missions that people are still playing."
metalgearsolid,ffgeh3v,t1_ffgbh2j,1579904425.0,"i'm very easy on games and think that internet gamer opinion is needlessly harsh and obnoxious 100% of the time. i also love metal gear and have played every game in the series over and over. i came in to survive thinking i'd get a decent but flawed game that maybe couldn't overcome all of it's issues. 

&#x200B;

instead what i got was something that was incredibly punishing and relentlessly unfun. i stuck with it for 10 hours and never once felt like i was having a good time. worst of all was that the game didn't even feel connected to the series legacy. the other games constantly call back to each other, with lines, scenarios, items, etc etc etc. should have been easy enough to include a fucking cardboard box somewhere, but i never once saw anything at all that really felt like a nice homage. game was nothing but pure tedious grind, over and over."
metalgearsolid,ffgdrnd,t1_ffg842q,1579903983.0,yeah i bailed after about 10 hours. the early game was just so damn brutal for no reason. stuff like the map system was just absurdly punishing. map doesn't update til you get back to base? sucks but i can deal. but your waypoint randomly disappears too? come the fuck on. i tried to grind by searching for more teleporters but when i discovered that you can't activate them until the game gives the ok i quit. give me a sense of satisfaction at least occasionally for fucks sake.
