You do realize that comedians only say things like that to make the audience feel more comfortable laughing at something controversial, right? That, and shaming you into feeling guilty/bad/stupid about not laughing at it. Plus, it makes people feel all smug thinking they have a better sense of humor than someone else, which is an added bonus

We are talking about their objective chances, and they never had a chance of doing what Operation Barbarossa intended to do, which was take the USSR effectively out of the war by winter. That much is true, whether or not the Germans believed it.

We don't even know about all of the organisms alive today, never mind a complex ecostystem millions of years in the past.

To me, his appearance is sort of irrelevant to the overall plot. It only really added to the story when you get character's internal thoughts, and you don't get that in the show.

Basically, I think his appearance served a purpose in the books for a perspective that doesn't exist in the show.

Generally, book renly and show renly, in broad strokes, are pretty much the same character and hold the same significance in the plot. I got a very ""knight of summer"" (as cat would say) vibe from him in the books and the show.

The issue isn't reading conprehension, it's your ability to make a clear, concise point.

My point is that karma is *only* a measure of how many people agree or disagree. That's it. If they were hovering around -15, that wouldn't mean much.

However, I'd like to think that people here are generally reasonable, and if you're sitting at -150 karma on your comment, and *that many people* disagree with your comment, it probably wasn't very acceptable. Its about the degree to which the karma is so negative, not just the mere fact that its negative.

So even if there were thousands of JP3 raptors on Isla Sorna, Blue would still be the ""last of her kind"". Even if her siblings still lived, she would still technically be ""the last one of her kind"".

The woman on the news could be explained away in a number of different ways, rangong from inflammatory media practices to Isla Sorna not being well known publicly (the general public, and therefore the media, may not even know about what happened there).
