No need to be obtuse.  My point is that if individuals shooting them in the streets did not work then, individuals punching them in the streets now will not either.  All it does is give them propaganda points on video.  In fact, one of the steps for fascists to rise to power is a violent opponent, according to Umberto Eco

&#x200B;

>Unified opposition to fascism would have been more effective, no?

On this we agree, however was the response to the rally in Charlottesville not a unified one?  Several of them were convicted of crimes, and others were fired from their jobs for merely attending.  No fascist rallies of that size have been organized since.
