Foodforthought,fe9o972,t1_fe73l1s,1578939905.0,That is just an unrealistic view of humor. Is it really the jokes doing the normalization? Or are the jokes only funny because it's already normal?
Foodforthought,fe5wjjd,t1_fe5s5gq,1578876535.0,Does wine o'clock have anything to do with how many glasses you drink? Like should we never joke about alcohol? If the answer is no then the line you draw is arbitrary and based on your own projections
Foodforthought,fdy31hq,t1_fdw6c43,1578775509.0,"When you remove alcoholism from the picture, the jokes are obviously not harmful. Most people who buy those products are not alcoholics and they won't ever be."

gay_irl,fdp3kt2,t1_fdobhfo,1578619178.0,It's because there's no pressure to please if they're distracted doing something else
worldnews,fdhg4u0,t1_fdgr4og,1578421926.0,Reddit isn't a religion supposedly focused on love and forgiveness. Not a good comparison.

David and Tamler wrap up the decade with an episode on trash-talking that morphs into a debate over the value of experimental inquiry. Participants in a lab put more effort into a slider task after theyâ€™re insulted by a confederate. Do experiments like these tell us anything about trash-talking in general? Can it explain the effect of Mike Tyson telling Lenox Lewis heâ€™d eat his children, or of Larry Bird looking around the locker room before the 3-point contest saying he was trying to figure out whoâ€™d finish second? Can it tell us how football players should talk to their opponents? Does it give us a more modest but still valuable insight that we can apply to the real world? This is our first real fight (or disagreement) in a while.

Plus, some mixed feelings about Mr. Robot Season 4 Episode 11 and some tentative predictions (recorded before the finale which aired by the time this episode is released). Happy holidays!"
