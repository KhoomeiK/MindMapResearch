I wish we lived in one of those little small towns where we were the only school, seems it would be much simpler. I'm just worried about trying to find these people down the road hahaha"
UGA,ff0iwcm,t3_eqya41,1579469286.0,"plenty of bars in downtown athens for a variety of crowds. best thing to do is check them out and see what you like :) they’re all within close proximity of one another and it’s easy to check out several in one night. my favorites are magnolias, boars head (almost always live music), 9ds (90’s music, slightly older crowd) and centro (good music but very packed and very young crowd). have fun in the classic city!!!"
