But we do live in a society and people we have to live near people with different priorities. Having weeds is in no way breaking a social code. I just think you have unrealistic expectations. Or perhaps you just need to live in a posh neighborhood where everyone can afford a crew of lawn workers and don't mind spraying toxic chemicals everywhere.
