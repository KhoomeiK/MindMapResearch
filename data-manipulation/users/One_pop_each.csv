snowboarding,ffrpopa,t1_ffqqthk,1580163057.0,"I let my buddy use my little 155 that I loved bc it was so short and fun to ride. Had my favorite bindings ever on them. I had a 160 setup that I just got on Black Friday so I was being nice. He decided to go to the bar that night and left it in the bed of his truck. A friend drove him home. 

It dumped snow that night and I took him to go get it the next day bc I was tripping out. Naturally, it was gone. I was digging through the snow in his bed like a madman. 

The only true memory I have of it is [this](https://i.imgur.com/OA3ah3X.jpg) amazing pic my wife took. 

If anyone sees a Burton Clash 155 with bright orange Burton Freestyle bindings around Anchorage, AK, let me know."
WTF,ffp42qr,t1_ffo3a32,1580085726.0,"Nowhere near the same but I flew to Chicago for a music festival one weekend and caught strep. Had to get on a plane the next day back and my left ear wouldn’t pop. For an entire god damn week it just stayed sealed shut. Felt like the left side of my head was dunked in water. It was driving my crazy, man. Then one day I yawned and it gave way. It was SO god damn satisfying."
todayilearned,ffnzicj,t1_ffnuihb,1580072648.0,"Ah, that makes a ton of sense. It definitely looks very, very touristy. It seems like one business went all out on appearances and everyone copied their idea. Gstlinburg was wayy more congested than Pigeon Forge. 

There are a ton of hikes here that I really want to do. I did one in Townsend yesterday but there’s a Fire Tower hike that’s like 11 miles long I would really love to see. 

I was stationed in Alaska for 6 years and had nature at the tips of my fingertips for so long. Then I got stationed in the middle of nowhere, South Carolina. We’ve camped on the NC/SC side of the Smoky’s and this is the first tike I’ve been on the Tennessee side. It’s really beautiful here and envious of those who get to experience them whenever they want."

I just got back from snowboarding in Gatlinburg and what the hell is up with Pigeon Forge?! I was not expecting the weirdest attractions ever. An alcatraz building, a giant pirate ship, like 7 different $9.99 stores. It blew my mind. 

Sorry, off topic. But the question still stands."

facepalm,ffhdoxe,t1_ffgz58b,1579931072.0,"I was at a Kevin Hart show and bought two things of roasted almonds and scarfed them down. Came home, went to bed and woke up to my hands itchy and I ran to the bathroom and puked. Most painful puke ever with shards of almonds going through my nose. Had no idea wtf was happening and my wife took me to the ER. My face was completely swollen. 

Turns out I was allergic. I had that itchy feeling with walnuts before and I just avoided them. Never thought I was allergic to tree nuts. 

Now I just stay away just to be safe. I don’t even eat shit with almond flour. 

I was in denial for years and all it took was one crazy reaction. Docs told me allergies can get more severe with age too. 

Get tested, people."

I’m a wee ol’ TSgt (E6) so it’s kinda weird communicating with someone that high up the chain, although we’re “anonymous.” Anyways, he was saying that it’s funny when Lt Col or Col get up to the Pentagon because they end up being coffee runners or gophers to the Generals up there and they resent it until they pretty much know their place. 

It’s crazy because my Wing Commander is a Colonel. Super sharp, amazing dude too. I cannot picture him getting to the pentagon after running a Fighter Wing to grab coffee and shit for Generals"

Sidebar: A singer of one of my fav bands was doing a song workshop. I paid $500 for him to write and record a song for me with details I gave him. It turned out to be absolutely amazing. I waited until our anniversary to give it to my wife. Kinda cool that artists offer things like that."

I love how all those kids were on stage to take part in a complex cover of a song from the 70’s! It’s insane how timeless music can be and how much it brings people together. 

The magic of Pink Floyd, I suppose. 

The sound was typical auditorium sound, nothing crazy but amps and mics. Yet it gave me goosebumps when that chorus kicked in. They were great indeed."

insaneparents,ff52g97,t1_ff4xfc4,1579578410.0,"Nope. He didn’t admit it. 

A girl posted a facebook comment on their fired guitar tech’s post. News outlets blew up with it bc this was peak metoo. She took interviews and shit. She went on a facebook group’s page and said she had proof in her myspace account on her computer in the basement. She went and logged on and posted a pic from Brand New in her myspace inbox the day Daisy came out. People blasted her bc why would Jesse DM her from the band’s page and that message was a promo message to their friends list saying the new album is out. Nobody batted an eye tho bc “victim blaming.” Then her livejournals were outed. In her livejournals she said she would lie about her age and made it a point to fuck as many band singers as she could. She was 18 when Deja Entendu came out, when this supposedly happened too. But again, nobody cares about facts. 

The other girl was their photographer. The same girl posted pics of Jesse jerking off on Skype in like 2011, some revenge porn shit. Keep in mind that she was like 25 or some shit at the time. When first girl’s story blew up, this girl dumped fuel in bc “why not?” Said jesse pushed her against a wall and kissed her but she wasn’t having it. 

The whole thing reeks of psychological issues. The first girl had a huge drug problem, been in psych wards and shit. Now, and only after the news picked up the story did she blame Jesse for her issues. Not self induced at all, apparently. 

Jesse cheated and banged out their backup guitarist’s fiance. Dude’s not perfect, but shit, man, neither are we. I’m just saying the facts are there for what we know. The news won’t write about those facts, only some soft ass allegation with no weight, just words. And it cost him his career. 

Follow degvasser on twitter and read the facts we know and form your own opinion."

He prolly has no idea who she even is but didn’t want to take away her spotlight. The band has donated to RAINN from their album sales before all this shit even came out. 

Go learn about the girl and form your own opinion rather than go off of whatever the mass is saying."

There are loads of shit about the girl who accused him but nobody bats an eye bc people think people don’t lie about shit for attention.

But sure. Continue with your narrative and keep walking this pathway of righteousness."
insaneparents,ff4wpc9,t1_ff4ri48,1579574262.0,"Allegations, dude. Let’s set the record straight. The girl who accused him hasn’t been completely truthful ever since her public social media/livejournal was outed. 

The internet is not a court room. Don’t just bash on someone just because one person said one thing and news outlets took it because of the metoo movement peak. Nobody knows the real story."
