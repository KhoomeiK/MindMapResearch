gifsthatkeepongiving,ffhyjh8,t1_ffhwiiy,1579959353.0,I’m pretty sure the last time this was posted someone said this was pretty illegal there too and that a few people complained to Management.

aww,ffgwobq,t3_etjlx7,1579916971.0,This is adorable and creepy at the same time. It looks weirdly robotic.
gaming,ffftgh2,t1_fffbmwi,1579891428.0,Played several games starting from Greenland. I can infect everyone but can’t kill fast enough. I’ve won every game I started in the Uk.
AskMen,ffcekub,t3_esruuu,1579797780.0,"I take mine off when I’m doing stuff around the house. I also take it off before taking a dump as I’m left handed and even though I meticulously wash my hands there’s just something mental about it. My wedding ring is tungsten and the jeweler did tell me there’s tools to break tungsten if needed but if something happens and it comes down to the ring or your finger breaking, it’ll be your finger, so I’m cautious."
WinStupidPrizes,ff7otdc,t3_erv6w0,1579654713.0,She is the reason warning labels exist.
selfimprovement,ff3pks8,t3_eqme60,1579546105.0,"Look up “the 5 essential people skills” by dale carnegeie. It’s a book that is literally all about teaching you to be assertive and to stand your ground. My Rmo at work mentors all her new managers by taking them through this book and as a 100% natural passive person who had no idea how to be assertive, This book has changed my life. Get this book and a highlighter and highlight things that stick out to you. There’s also activities or self reflective questions at the end of each chapter. Try and practice the lessons. Then when you see some improvement, grab a different colored highlighter and read it again. Can’t recommend this book enough."
PS4,feun80b,t3_eqk0o5,1579388152.0,Yeah I’m not a tech guy so if I did this mine would also be dead silent. Because it would be dead.
aww,fep9nf7,t1_fep7az3,1579315251.0,Exactly. It’s sick.
aww,fep5fgo,t1_fep1k31,1579312535.0,"Based on the video it seems he may only get a brief overview of what he’s getting into and that way the reactions and questions appear more genuine.

The guy might have faked the application process and then dropped his video.


Could also be that Dr Phils entire career is based off of dragging out peoples drama and hate so he has to try to spin something every once in a while to make it seem like his show is for genuine crisis mediation and that he really wants to help people.

AskReddit,feinec0,t3_epcvka,1579142596.0,"I wasn’t sheltered but my mom went through a weird phase for a couple years and banned Harry Potter in the house because she said it was promoting witchcraft and allowing evil spirits into the house. 

Which is ironic because I clearly remember her reading sorcerers stone to me as a young child."
nottheonion,feibsib,t1_feht900,1579134821.0,It’s depressing that your last sentence even needed to be said.
thedivision,fe2nk99,t3_eno5mn,1578840936.0,Yes it is. Most posts will be about div 2 but the sidebar still has faqs and wikis for div 1
oldpeoplefacebook,fdwlzn1,t1_fdwkkij,1578760065.0,"I think he means the hole itself. Which leads to so many questions. Is the nostril the hole itself, or the skin around that creates the hole?  

I’m way too high for this."
personalfinance,fdret51,t1_fdqg8bb,1578683578.0,Can confirm. My daycare is also more expensive than my mortgage.

worldnews,fcys1on,t1_fcyiqrp,1578085858.0,"Huh, TIL. So I’m a bit ignorant when it comes to the ins and outs of stuff like this but wasn’t Russia removed from the council or something like that, wasn’t Trump trying to get them reinstated during one of the more recent summits? Or am I misunderstanding?"
elderscrollsonline,fc5i0kh,t3_eg1jnb,1577458148.0,I downloaded it on my wife’s standard Xbox the other day. Took about 4 hours at ~ 75-80 mb/s dl
