I absolutely hated it and told him it means war, so now I'll occasionally put a finger, wet or not, in his ear, just because it turned out he hates it more than I do. He's much stronger than me and he's not ticklish so the only way I can mess with him is to catch him off guard. We also poke each other while saying ""diddle diddle"" in a weird voice."

depression,fe28phv,t3_enlso6,1578835675.0,It depends on the country and the hospital and all sorts of factors. I believe it's a rule that you have to stay for at least 3 days if you submit yourself. Basically long enough for them to determine if you're a danger to yourself or anyone else. After they diagnose you you'll either have to stay or you'll be released and get scheduled check ups. I'm not a doctor tho.

Sean and John are team captains and are in almost every episode of it, and I've watched both of these. Occasionally they do mini games like this, they did soccer, all sorts of funny stuff. So yea, countdown."
