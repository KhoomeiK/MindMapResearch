I don't know about the other channels, or about how they deal with their clients.

Reddit's hate boner for large businesses is no secret, so I know I'll be unpopular even just playing devil's advocate. But I don't think Jukin is nearly as bad as they're being painted, and I certainly see their point *and even agree* that MxR wasn't in the realm of Fair Use."

I certainly wouldn't have had them go into a meeting with Jukin without a lawyer. A smart thing to do would have been to come to Jukin with a proposal for an arbitration, with Jukin covering the cost of the arbitrator. They'd likely have gone for that, since Jukin, as the plaintiff, had nothing on the line. Most arbitrations, much like court cases, get settled in deals outside the arbitration as both parties start to see which way the case is going.  

But the Quartering put way too much stock in the popularity contest of YouTube having an impact on the outcome. It likely didn't do anything.

Jukin only cares about the hate to the extent that some of us have  been harassing employees directly, and even threatening them with violence (I'm guessing)."

I mean, it sounds like they *did* owe Jukin money. When Henry said it was something he was sure the fans would be happy with, that likely meant that he paid the ~~$49~~ $299 per video, and then set up a subscription with Jukin to have access to their full video library. I don't know what that would cost, maybe a couple hundred dollars a month? MxR makes a lot of videos, so I'm sure it was a decent amount but nothing outrageous.  

People also tend to forget that MxR is not just two kids making videos for fun. It's a business. And a decently sized one at that. I'd estimate that on the low end, MxR Mods makes around $200k/year from Patreon alone (could easily be over $600k/year), but of course they also get sponsors on many of their videos. And they only have two employees, and very little in the way of business expenses. I get the impression that Henry doesn't really separate his business and personal finances, though, just because he doesn't seem to have any employees other than his girlfriend, and he really should have an accountant and a lawyer on retainer at the size business he's running. 

But that rant went a little off the trail- my intended point was that paying a thousand a month for video content is a very minor expense to a business his size, and well worth it if it protects him for potential legal action."
MxRMods,fek6c0l,t3_epjdtf,1579193526.0,I feel like The Quartering gave some really bad legal advice...
MxRMods,fek602t,t1_fek0889,1579193329.0,"The other option they had was to not use someone else's copyrighted material without permission...  

The more I  listen to actual lawyers on this, the more I come to side with Jukin. Which sucks, because I'm a huge MxR fan, but it's fair to see them as the bad actors in this exchange.  

And even if Jukin is making money hand-over-fist from these videos and not sharing it with the creators, that's on the creator for signing the contract, which there is *no* way Jukin could strong-arm them into doing.  

Jukin has the right to proposition people to buy their content. And they have the right to deny or sell copyright permission to content that they own the copyright to. And, yes, they have the right to offer alternatives to legal action when they feel that someone has infringed on a copyright that they own."
Shitstatistssay,fek5dwa,t1_fejvf6w,1579192964.0,"So is the rectifier made out of something that isn't metal? In the context of talking about pollution, that's what matters."
MxRMods,fek5akd,t1_fejtfze,1579192909.0,"Again, if they went to court, MxR could have lost *millions* because they didn't buy the license. When you try to retroactively pay for something you stole, the cost of that item when it was for sale becomes irrelevant (to a degree) in determining an out-of-court settlement. What is relevant is what the reparations would be in court.  

If you steal someone's Lambo and take it for a joyride, the settlement isn't ""give us the cost of the broken window,"" it's instead ""how much do you not want to be convicted of grand theft auto?""  

By toeing the line of Fair Use and making significant money off of it, they painted a target on themselves and set themselves up to have those potential copyright infringement charges leveraged against them. If they were truly in the clear on Fair Use, Jukin would lose their leverage. But the more analysis I see of this case, the more I come to understand that the scales are not in their favor on Fair Use with these particular videos. Jukin probably had many more videos that they could have gone after, but they picked the ones that leaned in their favor. And the *actual copyright lawyer*, not some random talking head on the internet, has pointed out that on those particular videos that Jukin pursued, they had a good chance of winning if they were to go to court."
RPGdesign,fejsz92,t3_eph5cb,1579185102.0,"So Dex is more like Hand-eye coordination while Agility is speed? Sounds like I would really on Dex as the ""to hit"" stat in that scenario and agility for attacks per round or interruption."
Shitstatistssay,fejs33i,t1_fejmdmr,1579184464.0,"There are some other metals in the tip, but... if he's wrong, do you care to explain?"
MxRMods,fejrka8,t1_fejqotg,1579184076.0,That's 10% of the cost of losing the court case. How's that not reasonable?
MxRMods,fejr8zl,t1_feinykn,1579183849.0,"So without going to court, it's very hard to say that MxR Plays falls under Fair Use. At least two of the videos they were struck for *probably* would have gone to Jukin in court.  

And Jukin didn't feel any ""wrath"" other than some incidental harassment. They got what they wanted, which was reasonable compensation for their copyrighted material."
MxRMods,fejqx5e,t1_feivl20,1579183611.0,And maybe do more MxR's Kitchen episodes. Those don't rely on using copyrighted works in your videos.
