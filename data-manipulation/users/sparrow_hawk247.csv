fatlogic,ff3lxlt,t3_erdeb4,1579543859.0,"My family has famously awful joints, dad has two fake hips, 2 aunties and an uncle have fake knees. (They are healthy weights)

I’ve had a “bad knee” since I was 6. I noticed it was getting worse as I got older. 

I’m 50lbs down and it’s not half as bad as it used to be. It has its moments but  it’s definitely better."

childfree,ff2hu92,t3_er31jv,1579506781.0,"One day I’m going to be the best fun auntie, I love babies and even have a soft spot for toddlers occasionally, I know however I could not deal with the less fun sides of parenting (crying, tantrums, mess, etc) so I’m not going to put myself through that. 


I’ve come to realise I hate shitty parents more than I hate shitty kids."
fatlogic,feke10k,t1_fek3dn2,1579198085.0,"Agreed, if I ate un-restricted I would hands down be 350lbs. My body wants way more food than it could possibly need. 

Back in the day (I mean way back) where most people worked the fields from dawn to dusk and only had access to whole, unprocessed foods un-restricted eating was probably ok, healthy even but today you will straight up get heart disease and die."

interestingasfuck,fdpuudv,t1_fdpin89,1578641411.0,"This girl in particular was probably sedated, they found a substance similar to Cocain in her system and loads of alcohol. 

They think she might have died of exposure. 
She got the best of it though. They found another younger girl that had been struck by lightning and a younger boy that had probably been suffocated.?"
Art,fdnfloa,t3_em8ocn,1578584764.0,This is terrifying and I love it
medizzy,fdmrdnr,t1_fdkommy,1578562012.0,If someone’s heart isn’t beating though do you really have time to pull out a phone/QR code reader?

fatlogic,fdha14n,t1_fdh7or0,1578418610.0,"To be fair it was over the course of maybe 3 weeks (my birthday is close to Christmas and I used this as an excuse) but some of it has already come off, I have about 8lbs to go before I get back to where I was."
fatlogic,fdgx0o4,t1_fdguop4,1578410414.0,"I gained 10lbs over Christmas, and I was aware of how much crap I was eating (spoiler it was a lot) I can’t imagine how much how you have to eat to gain 100lbs in 4 months, that’s insane."
fatlogic,fdgwqah,t3_elb410,1578410215.0,"Diets do work, it’s just most aren’t sustainable.

If you want to lose weight and keep it off it’s a lifestyle change you need not a diet. Start something you can keep going and you’re not gonna regain, you think it would be logic but apparently not."
EntitledBitch,fddm9ow,t3_ekksg0,1578317565.0,"Holy fucking shit. 

On a side note: a hate brides who think it’s “their day” no it’s about you AND your partner, you’re meant to be celebrating how much you love each other or some shit. Not how great you are."

sex,fcnys5h,t1_fcnw3n6,1577821041.0,"I imagine it’s a side effect of most hormonal options (pills, paragaurd, implant etc) because of how hormones play a part in things like hair production. Women usually loose a load of hair after birth because of the sudden drop in hormones. BC can do the same kinda thing.

Edit: not paraguard, I meant the hormonal IUD"
