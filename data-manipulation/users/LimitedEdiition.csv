I remember them losing 2 close games where they had a chance to win but in one game Rivera decided to go for it instead of kicking the extra point to go to OT, and the other was something stupid that I don't quite remember. A healthy Cam Newton is good enough to lead a playoff team, so I think they should definitely compete if not this year then in 2021. Anything short of a playoff appearance is a failure imo. 



I just don't want us to make the same mistake of hiring another Shurmur or a McAdoo because our front office is too cheap to get a quality level coach.

Mitchell will put up the flashy shot and the nice crossovers, but it's Gobert doing all of the underground work to let this happen. It's not really your fault that you believe this because players like Gobert and Dennis Rodman get zero basketball coverage and all you see are Mitchell and Jordan highlights cause it's more marketable for casuals in the league. 



Mitchell is also more replaceable than Gobert. That's not to say that he's a scrub, but if I'm creating a team from scratch give me Gobert."

Great team chemistry and no ball hoggers, they certainly have a legitimate shot at the 8 seed, although I don't think they're quite there yet, so they might end up falling short like what Sacramento did late last year.


I don't watch a lot of Memphis games, but Ja in that one game against Houston looked like a legitimate top 10 point guard in the league.  Played like a veteran looking to get his team involved and only missed 1 FG that game. Obviously it's one game, poor sample size, but everything I saw from him had me foaming from the mouth. I was high on him going in to the draft and I think he will have a bigger impact than Zion, although that's a totally different discussion."

I remember them losing 2 close games where they had a chance to win but in one game Rivera decided to go for it instead of kicking the extra point to go to OT, and the other was something stupid that I don't quite remember. A healthy Cam Newton is good enough to lead a playoff team, so I think they should definitely compete if not this year then in 2021. Anything short of a playoff appearance is a failure imo. 



I just don't want us to make the same mistake of hiring another Shurmur or a McAdoo because our front office is too cheap to get a quality level coach.

Have a slight fever and no way to get Tylenol, Advil ect., dead. If you wear contact lenses or glasses and you break them, you're pretty much a goner. 


People glamorize these situation, but the truth is, you have a way higher chance or being that random corpse in that doomsday movie than someone who makes it to a settlement. In b4 of course that can't be me, it's them.

Mitchell will put up the flashy shot and the nice crossovers, but it's Gobert doing all of the underground work to let this happen. It's not really your fault that you believe this because players like Gobert and Dennis Rodman get zero basketball coverage and all you see are Mitchell and Jordan highlights cause it's more marketable for casuals in the league. 



Mitchell is also more replaceable than Gobert. That's not to say that he's a scrub, but if I'm creating a team from scratch give me Gobert."

Great team chemistry and no ball hoggers, they certainly have a legitimate shot at the 8 seed, although I don't think they're quite there yet, so they might end up falling short like what Sacramento did late last year.


I don't watch a lot of Memphis games, but Ja in that one game against Houston looked like a legitimate top 10 point guard in the league.  Played like a veteran looking to get his team involved and only missed 1 FG that game. Obviously it's one game, poor sample size, but everything I saw from him had me foaming from the mouth. I was high on him going in to the draft and I think he will have a bigger impact than Zion, although that's a totally different discussion."

modernwarfare,fdhh59w,t3_el9swc,1578422541.0,I still think getting killed by a friendly VTOL flying in entering the airspace on Hardcore is infuriating. Like why even fire those initial rockets if a teammate is in the vicinity.
aww,fdhgnso,t1_fdga9la,1578422246.0,Maybe if you don't train it or if you have an asshole bird (some cats are like that too). Not all of them are aloof.
science,fdh0m2b,t1_fdgzjr4,1578412772.0,"I think that's a little disingenuous to claim that every parent who has a child in a public school that's not an elite one doesn't care about them or is not putting their child's needs above their own. The fact that NYC even has specialized public high schools is a luxury within itself. The education you get in those rivals elite private schools and also the networking opportunities you get from connecting with past alumni, and I would know since I got scholarships for simply graduating from one of them. 


For the vast majority of the country though, they don't have that luxury and the only equivalent to that is a private school. It's just different out there compared to NYC."
science,fdgyt4e,t1_fdgyef0,1578411625.0,"Doesn't that already happen though? The public school I went to had plenty of resources that were propagated by donations from alumni. The more successful your alumni are, the more donations you receive to improve programs and infrastructure, the easier it is to attract more wealthy parents and students. It's a domino effect where the brightest and richest parents and children flock to this school vs the other one, and then you have unintentional segregation."
