I like how you are painfully aware its not actual science. You are genuinely aware it has no quantifiable method at its backbone yet you cling to it. It has no authority in a discussion about science yet here we are. Like a religious believer to faith.

Don't put evo-psych on its level. If all your theories are based on the fact that you can't quantify things and you still claim to actually be on the level of things that can.

Neither have I. My claim was that they posses a natural proclivity to those traits similar to men. 

It discredits your point that social interactions are not quantifiable. It also puts into question theories that have no scientitic weight behind them like this one. 

I have no interest in your last paragraph since its a pivot from a theory with zero data to back it up that you are nestling in with credibly studied social phenomenons. You can't just try to put your theory in the same discussion as the others you have stated."

There are multiple social interactions that are scientifically quantifiable and just because you came up with a theory that has no scientific legs to stand on doesn't mean you have authority. We both entered this argument knowing full well the traits we are talking about, acting that we don't is just childish. Oh look, now if you quote this one, i can agree on the attacks."

No women do not adopt these ideas, they aren't children fed every worldview by men. They can exhibit these ideas naturally by themselves.

Bringing us to the crux of the issue. These ideas aren't tied to masculinity. You can separate all the men and women from birth and there will still be set expectations in each group.
