Anything solid that hits your lips when you are drinking something is just fucking terrible.  Especially hours old cigarette butts.  Still not as bad as accidentally drinking someones spit cup uunngghh.

youseeingthisshit,fd7n4j9,t1_fd633mx,1578207034.0,back in high school we would shave 1 eyebrow off and leave the other.

ChoosingBeggars,fd7mp0e,t1_fd7mdcv,1578206840.0,I figured I'd keep the streak going until I just dont want to eat anymore damn RameM and become sick of it.  I am shocked that point hadnt come like 15+ days ago but here we are.  Soy Sauce or Pork are my favorites currently.  Soy Sauce used to be Oriental until they changed it.  Soy Sauce really isnt an accurate description but I guess they all really just taste like 2 days worth of sodium.   mmmm love it.
ChoosingBeggars,fd7mdcv,t1_fd6i6rw,1578206693.0,"haha right.  I have eaten at least one pack of ramen everyday for the last 42-44  days.  My female coworkers are horrified.   I started keeping track around day 7 or 8.  Not bc of lack of money (I am quite cash strapped tho) but bc it tastes good, its quick, and easy.  Living that #ramenlife.
