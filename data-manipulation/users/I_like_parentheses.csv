Also, this may be obvious but keep in mind that once you start splitting your available space between water and land, you're not going to have as much room to work with. So if a gecko typically needs a 40 gallon tank, you should get an 80 gallon one if you're dividing it 50-50 between land and water. Same thing with fish. A paludarium in a 20 gallon tank, for example, usually only nets about 5 gallons of water to work with, and that's not enough space or volume for most fish.

Remember, it's better to do one thing well (either the land or water habitat) than to do two things poorly. Make sure that if you're wanting inhabitants in both, they've got enough room and the right conditions.

Edit: One more thing -- it looks like the geckos you want are climbers, which is going to be hard (if not impossible) to accommodate in a typical long rectangular aquarium. You'll want to get one that's vertically oriented (which, again, will reduce the space for fish).

OP, I understand you have strong feelings for him but I hope you'll take a step back and ask yourself if this is really the kind of relationship you want? He comes to you when his current relationship is ending, you make him feel better, and then he leaves you not just to date but to MARRY these other women. Then he keeps you on the back burner with just enough sporadic communication so that you can't ever fully move on. These are horrible things to do to someone you supposedly love, and it's definitely not what a healthy relationship looks like. 

More importantly, **PTSD doesn't cause this**. My husband is a combat vet with ptsd and he has been the most solid, dependable partner I've ever had. Your guy is just, imo, being a jerk who is using you as a crutch in between relationships. I've known and dated guys like this and I know it's hard to resist that lure of ""maybe this time he'll stick around"", but I really think you need to keep this on a platonic level at best. (If it were me, I'd cut ties altogether. No relationship with someone who loves more than one woman at a time and also keeps leaving will ever be on solid footing, and *you deserve better*. Especially when he blames the disorder instead of taking responsibility for his actions.)

Edit: I know odds are good that you don't want to hear what I'm saying, and I get it. But for the love of all that is holy, if you insist on dating this man, at least WAIT. Do *not* start something romantic or exclusive right away. Let him be single for a while and see how he handles it. I'm willing to bet it won't be long before he finds another relationship, because it doesn't sound like he cares who he's with so long as he's not alone. 

And seriously OP--I'll say it again because it bears repeating--you deserve so much better than to be jerked around like this."

It's not a good look and that kind of reputation will follow you.

You also don't want your chain thinking you have so much time on your hands that this is a significant problem for you. Trust me."
