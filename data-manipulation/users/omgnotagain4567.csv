depression,fekbm7i,t3_epmgz5,1579196650.0,I live in Germany and some trees have blossoms already. It's crazy.
depression,fekb4th,t3_epjj4q,1579196366.0,"As far as I know, the brain can protect us from overwhelming emotions by shutting them down and often releasing them later if it feels safe or stable enough. Crying might come back.
Cannot cry also, you are not alone."
BPD,fejkhjb,t3_eph8v4,1579177922.0,"I don't like the ""don't go in a relationships""-advices. Relationships are an essential part of the human life.  There might be times to be in your own and get to know yourself. But why cripple yourself even more by forbidding yourself the joy of relationships. Borderline is crippling enough. I currently started relationship again after a year of searching for myself and learning a lot. Now, of course, I struggle with abandonement issues again. But it's  a chance to learn these things."
BPD,fej6h2k,t3_epeqx8,1579158863.0,"I would read a lot about the jobs and the subjects  I am interested in. If their is more information, especially the annoying/negative things about it, I would notice If I am still interested. Also getting much information would help to move quickly through the overexited phase."
BPD,fehhaqs,t3_ep5moh,1579116521.0,"They do this because they only care for themselves. You are better of without him. It's really not okay treating people like this, especially loved ones. Reading this makes me really angry at him."
BPD,fehgg1x,t1_feg9kqo,1579116024.0,"Try to go to public library and get as many books/CDs/games you want. The feeling of getting something is quite similar. 
Does not work always. Bought a Nintendo Switch today but got the games from the library."
depression,febmp2k,t1_febjqqn,1578960488.0,"Still thinking about it. Please go, especially if suicidal thinking increases slowly. Even if you do not get your phone. Doctors at the hospitals like to get you there without the detour around the ER. Also, as I experienced it, suicidal thinking can spin really fast to action and to not wanting any help anymore. Also, if you go voluntarily, you can always leave, even the closed ward (after talking to doctor). This is not the case if you are odered by court, which happens, if you come from the ER because of suicidal action.
Speaking from experience in Germany."
depression,febjqqn,t3_eo76it,1578959555.0,"Maybe it depends on the country you life in. Where I was, you could have your phone even in the closed ward and there was also a free phone (not mobile) for the patients. They wanted us to stay in contact because it's healthy."
BPD,fe0t462,t1_fdxn5ah,1578818316.0,"I don't believe that. The fact that you wrote here and reached out for help says that you are no monster. Monsters don't care, they do not seek help, they do not really suffer or have empathy and enjoy abusing other people. 

There will be people who like you for who you are. You just need to find them. Maybe they are already there."
BPD,fdvcozk,t3_en47n1,1578746022.0,"The internet, with all it's stupid clickbait articles formed a very skewed image of bpd. The diagnostic spectrum of bpd is very wide, and it fits to so many different people. You are still yourself, and good people like you, really define what people with bpd are like. Not the stupid public notion about the condition. Nearly all mental disorders have their prejudices. For example, autistic people are not selfish assholes as Sheldon Cooper, and also people with bpd are not generelly abusive. When I told my SO about my diagnosis I also told him not to believe the articles if he googles it, but to get to know me personally, and if he needs information to ask me or get a book from the library, because they are less judgemental. He sees me as a person, and not as an illness, and this is what good people do.
People who discard you because of your diagnosis are not worth your time (nevertheless i would not recommend to start with this information as an icebreaker)"
