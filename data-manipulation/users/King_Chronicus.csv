todayilearned,ffchn2n,t1_ffc2g9o,1579799658.0,Funny you call it a scam. Not everyone has the mind of a criminal. And a shameless parasite? Making quite the assumption there. I've done nothing but wish the best for you and suggest you seek help for your anger issues yet you keep personally attacking me. Sounds a lot like something someone who needs some help with their mental health would say. If you ever want to talk then feel free to PM me. I'm sure we can find a few resources together.
todayilearned,ffc1j0w,t1_ffc02cg,1579789178.0,"No worries, buddy. I had my bank account drained by a hacker a few weeks ago and another subreddit helped me out. Appreciated all the same though! As for this guy? I think we all see how disconnected from reality a person can be when they take shots from behind a computer screen. I hope he finds happiness and a more positive outlook on life."
todayilearned,ffc12tm,t1_ffby8jx,1579788836.0,Theres nothing wrong with needing help sometimes. You should most certainly seek some yourself.
todayilearned,ffby09y,t1_ffb7ung,1579786381.0,"I'm sorry you feel so unsatisfied with your life. Instead of reaching out for negative attention you should reach out for a support system and try to improve who you are as a person. Instead of trying to rip others down to your level why don't you try and help yourself find inner peace? We're all flawed but you're not beyond saving, brother."

It's only happened if I piss after some aggressive sex or some aggressive alone time. Almost feels like if you just relex the big guy while he's looking down then you're going to massivly dribble all over yourself. Usually clears up in about half hour. Proceed."
