Exactly, that's what I was thinking. Unfortunately most people involved - especially CPS - don't even have kids and ridiculous high standards towards those parents. 
On the other hand I find it to be really good of them to be placing such great value on the kid's statement, as that means they're looking out for them - thankfully their parents are getting around to that idea too 

But I'll help them represent themselves adequately in court and recommended an awesome lawyer, who is confident to have the kids back home in two weeks tops, so I'm really hopeful here.

Cathy's got parents that also really need to keep their fights from their kids. 

She also has a younger brother, who really is a handful. Where she is obedient, calm and helpful he is freaking out at every request, very prone to violence and just occupies his parents all the time. There's also the youngest sister, though she is an angel.

They have help from family services in our country and imo are good parents, who utilize every resource there is.
Both come from a rough background with abuse, neglect and alcoholism and do their very best to provide the opposite environment for their kids. But it's hard, as they never learned proper communication or housekeeping.

Add into that that Cathy's brother destroys anything if left unsupervised, I was not surprised by her tantrums if she didn't want to go back home - same behaviour as with Sam, basically.

They were all working so hard on their family life and I still provide them with advice, had Cathy over alot overnight and help them with understanding letters and other things - sadly the kids are in temporary foster care now :(

Cathy admitted to lying about being abused at home recently, so they should be back in no time thankfully. She just wanted to get away from her brother, she said - and now they're in the same home, so that didn't work out :D
