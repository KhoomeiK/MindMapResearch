space,fejkpkv,t1_fejjq83,1579178151.0,"> also something about time moving slower when you move faster which again is basically like jumping to conclusions because you cannot prove it.

We have proved this to be true. First it was theorized and we made predictions of how much slower time flows when going at a certain speed.
Then we calibrated 2 very VERY accurate atomic clocks and left one on earth and put 1 in orbit. After it had been in orbit for a while we returned it to the surface and compared the time on both of them.

There's also the Hafele-Keating experiment which you can read more about here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafele%E2%80%93Keating_experiment

It showed time dilation by taking advantage of the rotational speed of earth.

The prediction was that the one that had been in space would be lagging very slightly behind the one left on earth (this was exactly what happened, tho the change was very slight since the clock that was in space never went anywhere near the speed of light). Not only did it happen but it matched our predictions.

I really suggest looking into all of this more because it's interesting as all hell but I also hope that people who write things in these scientific subreddits would not offer something as a fact unless they 100% knew it to be as such.

space,fejdf1u,t1_fej4a0t,1579168555.0,"well I'm no physicist so I'm sure there is a better way of explaining this.

Here are good videos explaining the issue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YFrISfN7jo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msVuCEs8Ydo


But equations that use causality start giving out funky answers if you exceed the speed of light.

Also if something goes faster than light then another observer could witness an end result happening before whatever caused the end result even happened. this has to do with Lorentz transformation.

However, if we did somehow realize that ""shit that was really a message from aliens"" then that might still help with our geopolitical mess since we as a race might pool our efforts into researching that, and lot's of other ""space"" related things. 

We would most likely see funding to NASA skyrocket, even more than during the space race. We'd research different methods of communicating over great distances, we'd probably start building stuff in space so that we could launch spacecraft directly from space instead of from the surface of our planet.
