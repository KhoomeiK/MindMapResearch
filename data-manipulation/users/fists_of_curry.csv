Economics,ff8fmxc,t1_ff86iac,1579676386.0,"rather than disagree with you, you raise an interesting point- there is usually the element of a colonial power that causes this ethnic minority to consolidate wealth and power. im repeating a script that sounds like the elite playing victim to deflect the truth

this seems to be the case for Ugandan Indians, this may be the case with Boer SAfricans. this is not the case for Chinese filipinos (tsinoys). we see this dynamic play out for the companies we consult for here. im really just venting about my job, the systemic corruption here makes it very difficult do it.

the tsinoys came from nothing, were the target of one maybe two pogroms during their generations herr and were forced to create a functioning productive society within a society. locals wont build a road for you? fuck it build road yourself. the spanish colonial power was laughable; extractive, incompetent,  complacent, ineffectual, just plain evil really, encapsulated in the corruption of the catholic church. anyway being the joke colonial power of europe what else would you expect?

the urban chinese was left unfucked with long enough to create an economic community more vibrant than the entire nation by simply reinvesting dividends back into their own community (made up of their own families). the diaspora is more Jewish than anything else, insular, scorned, mistrusted but wealthy and inscrutable. 

i dont agree with the system i shouldnt be too applogetic for the local Chinks here most of them are a bunch of lying stinking cheating tax cheats haha but you gotta respect them for their resilience.

the local chinese businesses we consult for are usually the good ones that do things by the book, and they get fucked over *by everyone* for being above board. its just funny that the local government and citizens wonder why the community is so insular when they spend most of their free time attacking and criticising them. if the wealthy ethnic minority they despise lords over them i say they deserve it haha

edit: whats my consultancy? we help people cheat on their taxes"
interestingasfuck,ff84792,t1_ff81j8q,1579665535.0,"these atms are usually booby trapped. theres a little midget who sits behind it writing down all your debit card details when you stick your card in... if theyre found out they will lunge at you with a straight razor. hence the need for body armor and a weapon. this atms already been cleared of midgets for demo purposes,"
Economics,ff6j4ny,t1_ff6864p,1579628306.0,"this is the exact same situation in the Philippines. The Chinese account for 1% of the pop, practically own 94.99% of all wealth producing assets, the rest belong to 12th generation Spanish slavers that are still riding high off of all of sweet colonial blood money.  

1. it's a small and easily identifiable population, the tax authority targets and harrasses them (the chinese) for bribes specifically and unscrupulously. the tax authority doesnt even bother auditing any non-Chinese individuals because 99% of the poplulation barely has two pennies to rub together on any given day.

2. despite this bullshit program called ""tax mapping"" all the tax authority does to identify its tax base is check if you have a chinese sounding last name and use a protactor to measure the angle of your slit eyes, if the measurement exceeds 45 degrees and the tax assessor actually learned to count without fingers, they write a number down on a napkin, this becomes the figure you must bribe them with.

3. you reject the bribe because you feel as legitimate business owner, youve paid all your taxes, fairly and on time. this kind of duty and diligence to your country upsets the tax assesor because they lack a prefrontal cortex. they threaten you with a full on audit that disrupts your business or prevents you from obtaining certifications to continue business. 

4. you relent to the bribe and the assessor may get you in trouble with the law out of resentment anyway. 

and this my friend is how a wealthy ethnic minority can, all at the same time, be a large %age of a poor country's tax base (fear of audit and scrutiny) and have high rates of white collar crime convictions.

now, the Filipinos have yet to make a two-peat of massacring the (local) Chinese, but Im sure when the Duterte administration needs a scapegoat, theyll be the first to the gas chambers. in the mean time, Indians needs to take a page from the Filipino Chinese playbook:

1. put huge sums of money behind politicians that *wont* kick you out of the country. added bonus: use these politicians to oppress and exploit the local populace.

2. change your last name to something non-chinese sounding. 

3. let your least favorite children intermarry with the locals. theyll be a nice buffer for during the race riots.

4. offshore everything, maintain dual citizenship, launder money through a mixture of local and foreign entities.

so the irony here is, ostracize a productive segment of your community, dont respect or treat them like neighbors, force them into positions of economic and political expediency that requires them to leverage control over you (the local masses) watch them exploit you and your local economy further, cant touch 'em because your own elected politicians made the rules, increase your resentment against them, force them deeper into supporting a corrupt system that cripples and stymies your chances for upward mobility, infiltrate their businesses because the only jobs you can find are provided by them, sabotage said businesses out of ignorance and resentment, further stymie your already garbage local economy, cause a recession, attempt to cleanse the ethnic minority, *dont* change the corrupt politicians that allowed it to happen, further fuck up your stupid country to the point where you beg the ethnic minority to return and build things up again and repeat!"

Humanoidencounters,feu77sn,t1_feoo3k2,1579383798.0,"there are some liner notes from an interview that is on geniuslyrics.com about the first line ""clock ticks/i think of you"" is about how her boyfriend accidentally broke a family heirloom clock of hers (time breaks/she decouples) he replaces the clock with another clock that  is too noisy and the clock becomes a memento mori; it reminds her of him and her mortality. it wrenches her back while propelling her forward and this is the paradox of rembering when the object of remembrance is time itself.

next, the first few stanzas end cryptically """"suitcase of memories/time after"" period. not ""time after time"" just ""time after."" whatever causes the initial dislocation causes her to travel to a time, after time, or simply, outside of time. 

in ever stanza after she is out of sync with whomever she sings to aside from the chorus. Hymans addition of the second male voice in the chorus was an artistic choice Lauper instinctively keeps in, the echo is the repetition of the encounters where they just miss each other. they are not just physically separate they exist but in separate exostential planes like the upside-down

its actually the army of the 12 monkeys series that captures this tragedy, and quite cogently, if i may add. we project into our future our dwell in our past so much so it hurts the ones we love or it abets our enemies. the hubris that we can control time blinds us to who is friend or foe. 

Lauper reluctantly leaves on a train which practically an allegory of cinema itself. if the song is a meditation on the nature of time, by entering the train she accepts time both as an immutable stream and as paradoxical to our imstinct. the train is an object that remains as a constant reference point but navigates a deterministic space-time. 

in other words, time does not move around us as a force that acts on our surroundings like entropy, we move through time, all that has and can exist as it were an ocean, we swim through with some agency but for the most part we are caught in more powerful currents. the idea of falling in Laupers song is more logical in line with the true nature of experiential time, we fall through it, somewhat helplessly.

the film Lauper views at the beginning is The Garden of Allah, in it the lovers fortunes areforetold by a diviner- their journey brings happiness but ultimately tragedy, a tragedy instigated by a legacy passed down to the male lover."
