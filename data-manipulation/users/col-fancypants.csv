AskReddit,ff8ui9d,t1_ff8u5u5,1579696532.0,Crap your right. But how can I live up to the power of Jim Croce or Gordon Lightfoot?
todayilearned,ff8sin7,t1_ff72uc2,1579694392.0,"Oh as a director he is insanely good! I was just commenting on his acting. Get the Gringo, Dragged Across Concrete, The Beaver, and Blood Father were just him showing off how good he still is."

UpliftingNews,ff6yy63,t1_ff6w5uh,1579637765.0,I didn't know how my parents voted until I was around 12. When my dad and I talk current events it's usually pretty neutral. Explains our love of a good Swiss roll or chocolate.
UpliftingNews,ff6yftv,t1_ff6t3h9,1579637466.0,"It's just good manners not to say who you will or did vote for. And as far as religion goes... well I don't bash anyone, but I do find a simple joy in just saying a denominations name in a serious way when passing their establishments. ""Methodist"" ""Catholics"" Witnesses"" ""Baptists"""

UpliftingNews,ff6xukq,t3_ervw8g,1579637121.0,"I safe good society can be made of armed and thoughtful citizens and unarmed and thoughtful citizens. What counts, Vasily, is the thoughtfulness. 

Personally I never mention my true feelings on any political or social hardlines because no one seems to be able to remember the thoughtful part when it comes to someone who thinks different than them. Abortion, guns, drugs, prisons, politicians, foreign affairs, immigration, sex, gender, race, religion, faith, beliefs, hobbies, Marvel vs DC, Book vs Movie, money, distribution of ownership, liking something that involved someone who eventually did something awful, etc etc etc. Unless you know someone well enough on any of these issues, it is almost always advisable to not bring them up. Mental minefields for your social interactions."

AskReddit,ff66vw9,t1_ff64han,1579620559.0,"See, I just saw school and studies as a job for most of my childhood. Go, take notes, do homework, and get what you get on a test. I had a 3.8 in high school and a 3.6 in college, but I swear on the land that it was by chance. I am terrible at math test to the point I know I must have gotten at least a C in every math class. But every year a B or an A showed up. Probably NCLB kept me moving along. And my degree, History, story time for 4-5 hours a day. I have been on cruise control school and job wise for so long I just accept it. But I know I am not the bright bulb people think I am. Just fortunate and unhealthily lucky. 

People telling me I am smart because other people were either to lazy or had to keep minimum grade averages to fail me is the biggest joke of my nearly 30 year life so far."
AskReddit,ff63vat,t1_ff61ajb,1579618473.0,I was told I was smart my whole life. I heartily disagree. I know my mind better than other people. Luck and good memory are not excuses for intelligence.

AskReddit,ff5shrz,t1_ff5s9na,1579608555.0,"Oh yeah, and we were roommates for almost 5 years after college. So we literally just played video games, watched movies, and went shooting all the time. It was insanely good times. We lived our best lives for sure."

AskReddit,ff5sb5t,t1_ff5d447,1579608350.0,"Fun story, I completely missed getting baptized somehow for 24 years of my life. It was a shock to everyone but me. My parents, family, and friends had all assumed it had happened at some point they didn't remember. Lucky for them I made a joke about being an unwashed believer a couple times. Don't really care for church and never really did, but I believe in my own way. Also, 13 year old me would be cool with fact we married an Irish Catholic from Mass. Our marriage is a peace treaty between the North and the South and Catholics and Protestants. My wife never gets that history joke, but that's okay, 13 year old me would find it hilarious."

I never wanted anything other than to be content and have happiness in life. Like the songs say, dreams are for those who sleep."
AskReddit,ff5rte6,t1_ff5hag8,1579607778.0,I for one did and do not. I knew early in life I had 0 marketable skills beyond story telling and excellent comprehension/problem solving skills.
AskReddit,ff5rqpl,t1_ff54ztk,1579607690.0,"Not at all dude! My neighbor growing up was in a band for 15 years during and after college and then in his late 30's early 40's started playing the bar scene with some guys. He is getting into his 50's and still plays and sings. Mad respect for following your passion, even as a hobby. I love storytelling, but the best you will get out of me is a D&D campaign at this point at 29.  (OAR 41 was his band, don't google, they died out before the internet and their music lives on my computer alone probably. But they were pretty good. My neighbor was lead and he had a softer voice with just enough gravel in it if that makes sense)"
AskReddit,ff5rgss,t1_ff53fdl,1579607360.0,"13 year old me would be laughing at the fact that, as lovers of history, we married an Irish Catholic from Massachusetts while we are Non Denominals from South Carolina and live just outside Atlanta. If that isn't the peace marriage to show the North and South can't get along then I don't know what is. 

He would also be disappointed that we didn't conquer a small island nation with our best friend. Now we work an office job (the back up plan) and the best friend is still the best but he is on the SWAT team in the county over from where I live."
AskReddit,ff5r9g2,t1_ff5byew,1579607114.0,Imagine being 13 and thinking that the sensible choice is to get a decent office job after four years of college and just use my degree as a back up if I had to teach. I really shot for the stars and made it to graceland.
AskReddit,ff5r6ja,t1_ff56u0v,1579607014.0,13 year old me either wanted to be an FBI analyst or work a decent office job. I do the latter so clearly 16 years didn't change much about me.

AskReddit,ff5r2uj,t3_ero8mj,1579606884.0,"He would probably be pretty chill with my life. I still play video games, watch every thing he loves, read epicly good books, have a wife, make way more money than he ever thought possible, and am still friends with the people he was friends with. He may question my D&D and 40K hobbies at first, but would come to love them. He would also be proud that I eat just about any kind of food now. In 16 years, I really haven't changed that much as a person and I am okay with that."

todayilearned,fctzwgb,t3_eipcwt,1577967584.0,"Ever go back and watch Heavy Weights? That movie is packed with people who were going on to make history. Judd Apatow, Paul Feig, Kennan Thompson, Allen Covert, and Peter Berg. It was the first writing and stand out acting roles for most of them. It was Apatow's first credit for writing, producing, and he acted in it. Paul Feig's first major acting role. Thompson's first role outside of the Mighty Ducks. Stiller had done work before, but it was the first time I remember him being hilarious. Covert was the camera man who got to smoke in a Disney movie. And Peter Berg was just in there as the shady cook."
