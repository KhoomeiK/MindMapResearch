worldnews,ff8nh89,t1_ff8ml0p,1579687399.0,"So you're asking for us to use more fossil fuels and your argument is that we can offset that?  I disagree on that point.  You do realize that the entire world is using too much as it is right now right?  Offsetting, assuming you actually can in a minimally invasive way leaves us just as fucked as before with slightly less plastic.  That's all it would do.  More weight in transport, takes more gas for you to drive it home etc.,"
worldnews,ff8nbu0,t1_ff8lkrc,1579687167.0,Nature already started on that one.  We need to be careful with that one though because it could be too aggressive and make plastic useless to us.  You know wood didn't deteriorate until something evolved to eat it right?  Same thing will happen to plastic so better to not alter the natural course and overcorrect when these organisms are already adapting to the existence of plastic.

So it is even more advanced than that.  However, most deaf people DO also know the regional language or at least partially.

My best friend's dad is deaf so it took him a few times to explain why some deaf people can't understand finger spelling that well if you try to speak english instead of ASL, for example.

He also spoke of a deaf university that only is taught with fingerspelling.  Crazy"
Wellthatsucks,fcx80m3,t1_fcvwff2,1578054909.0,"If evolutionary traits like this come about we have to assume that it exists because the ones that don't go away from the ""pack"" don't pass on their genes at the same rate.  So theoretically it was a big burden to those packs and they died off.

Obviously not every time, but significant numbers would have to fail for this expression to be so prevalent.  Oddly it's not a trait either as it's not known to be a dominant or recessive gene expression, so we can assume it gives their pack an edge."
