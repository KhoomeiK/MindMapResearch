facepalm,fe1y3zs,t1_fe1qlzl,1578832228.0,"You're right, I was too busy to read the article and moved on after my comment. 

The article does make a few good points but in the end I think the author expects too much here, and at the same time missed quite a few things which makes this movie worth it. Yes, World War 1 was an evil war without any overarching noble goal like defeating Nazis as World War 2 had. Nationalism, militarism, imperialism and the like were the underlying causes of WW1 and as such it should've been prevented. But when the author says things like:

>The crucial observation here is that when you set a movie during World War I but use a simplistic narrative structure which tells audiences that one side was completely right and the other completely wrong, you (perhaps unintentionally) validate the nationalist impulses that led to such terrible bloodshed.

I think he missed quite a few points the movie attempted to make. I sincerely hope no one came out of the movie theater and thought that the British were inherently good and the Germans inherently bad and that this was just a question of right and wrong.

Take the scenes where they cross the no man's land at the beginning of the movie, for instance. The two English soldiers don't comment on their surroundings that much, but the camera gives us a good view of them nonetheless. They showcase the senseless violence of WW1 and the trenches, and the impact it had on the soldiers living in them, without explicitly telling us so. German and British soldiers alike are rotting in mud or the barbed wire. Or take the scene in Ecoust and the guy's escape from that. You see the destruction done to the village, the woman and the kid just trying to survive, and soldiers of both sides floating in the river side by side. It's also shown with the German soldier in Ecoust who gets strangled: both soldiers look alike, they're roughly of the same age, and as a viewer you (well I did at least) get the feeling that at any other time, these boys could've been friends. 

So in the end, I disagree with the author that the movie showcases too much nationalism. To the contrary, I think the movie did a good job of showing us the needless and senseless destruction WW1 brought for both sides, and that it calls us to do better than that. It just didn't *explicitly* tell us so via one or the other character, but the message was there nonetheless."
