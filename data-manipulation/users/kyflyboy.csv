todayilearned,ffmah5c,t3_eu5wt2,1580051361.0,Yeah. I think the open office concept has seen it's day. Time to bury that idea.
WeirdWings,ffjjgy7,t3_etxk0z,1579999613.0,Supposedly quite noisy in the cabin and lots of vibration from the engines. Have seen one operate out of Aspen. Cool looking. Not successful.

Military,feouos9,t1_fenkfis,1579305833.0,"That phrase is the standard language for intelligence classified as Top Secret. In this case, the T/S classification almost certainly comes from the sensors and tracking capability (and possibly radio communications), and not from the actual object being tracked."

askscience,fdp1wws,t3_emg093,1578618042.0,"That is an excellent question. Why do we have to depend on ""finding the black box"" in this day and age?  We should stream the data in real time. No technical reason we can't do that. Just add $s."
news,fdoajkv,t1_fdnyz6g,1578601717.0,"Trigger happy Navy Captain.  I met him.  Most officers thought he was overly eager to fire, and didn't bother to double check."
todayilearned,fdo9efd,t3_em9iyn,1578601166.0,Somehow he's also the executive producer on the Amazon Jack Ryan series.
EngineeringPorn,fdnb0ci,t3_em4lv3,1578581877.0,Would be interested in knowing the story of how your established yourself as an independent Mech Eng doing design work. How did you do that and is it working out?

flying,fdn6j3a,t3_em7tyq,1578578648.0,"If you're really going to fly that much,  you should have a solid IFR capable aircraft. I'd be very cautious on some of those legs over water and mountains.  Not easy work in a small,  light aircraft."
ManifestNBC,fdkj9va,t1_fdfpvdl,1578504887.0,She was on Homeland where she played the President (sort of a stand-in for Hillary)
LifeProTips,fdhf7q8,t3_eldlu9,1578421379.0,Great advice. Also floss daily.

todayilearned,fcicnj5,t3_ehady7,1577660578.0,Imagine Disney World outside Orlando.
politics,fcg00kf,t1_fcfu4v4,1577635245.0,But the rules of the Democratic National Convention where stacked against any other candidate vis a vis the Super delegates. Hugely un-democratic.

politics,fcfz5kp,t1_fcfnstd,1577635079.0,"The freezing of the size of the House is a gross and much outdated policy. There are several methods on how to enlarge the House without increasing their number dramatically. 

The NYTimes analysis suggested an approach yielding a House of \~600. It's a cogent argument.  [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/09/opinion/expanded-house-representatives-size.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/09/opinion/expanded-house-representatives-size.html)"
politics,fcfykth,t1_fcf5s9w,1577634870.0,"**That almost happened in 2004** in the Kerry versus Bush election. John Kerry lost Ohio by \~118,000 votes out of nearly 6 million votes in Ohio. So if \~60,000 votes switched from Bush to Kerry, Kerry would have won Ohio and the Presidency while losing the national popular vote by 3 million to the incumbent President. 

I so wish that would have happened, not just because of the illegal Iraq war, but because that outcome would likely have led to abolishment of the absurd electoral college.

There are many ways to side-step the electoral college without a Constitutional amendment -- states could allocate their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote, and my favorite ranked-preference voting."
politics,fcfupca,t1_fcfhmrz,1577633899.0,"You're right. The Dems were so cock-sure that they would win in 2016, that the Supreme Court nomination would fall into place after that. What a mistake.  And RBG is perilously close to leaving us, which could allow Trump to provide 3 Supreme Court justices, a legacy that our great-grandchildren will need to cope with. It's a terrible future scenario."
politics,fcftvxk,t1_fcfap7u,1577633723.0,I really liked Keith O. Wish he were still in this place.
politics,fcfss1n,t1_fcei0zf,1577633367.0,God that's depressing. I do miss Kieth Olbermann.  I think the solution is public financing of elections.
politics,fcfrchn,t1_fcfio4k,1577632993.0,"And ""W"" still gets my vote as worst President, despite Trump. As of yet, Trump hasn't led us into an unjustified war resulting in thousand of American deaths and tens of thousands of deaths from other nationalities; all on totally false and fabricated evidence. Truly a war crime."
politics,fcfqkif,t1_fcfcz9g,1577632747.0,"This. Kennedy's ill-timed departure (couldn't wait until the 2018 elections), along with his parting comments revealed a strong political leaning that is unacceptable for a Supreme Court judge. His recommendation of Kavanaugh confirms his political agenda. Disgraceful."
