HauntingOfHillHouse,ffa96e8,t3_esalqf,1579730322.0,Why would a different character ever play Olivia when she never aged like Hugh did? He was only played by two different characters because he aged lol it has nothing to do with the actress being young looking (which she is--but it has nothing to do with anything)

college,fdb2ixe,t1_fdagl10,1578253025.0,"Lol I figured!! If you have Facebook joining the “Marquette buy sell trade” group might be beneficial to you, people are posting in it a lot with houses/apartments to rent! Zillow also had quite a few options last I checked :)"
college,fdafz85,t3_ekc8bl,1578245585.0,"If you’re (by chance) talking about northern, first of all you wouldn’t be considered a freshman or sophomore. Second of all the rule to having to live on campus doesn’t apply if youre over 21 (I believe) AND can live within 40 miles of the college, so if you have the ability to live off of campus go for it!!"
relationship_advice,fahwlyp,t1_fahuko2,1576095011.0,"I think that would be a good way to go. Just straight up ""my mom doesn't want us talking anymore I'm sorry"" and leave it at that. I don't think that you should cut off contact with every single girl your mother doesn't want you talking to now and in the future, but this particular girl doesn't seem to be doing you any good."
