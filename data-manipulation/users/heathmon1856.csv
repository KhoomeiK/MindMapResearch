cscareerquestions,ffw46id,t3_evjgtc,1580283556.0,"Has anyone else just completely lost all motivation to study interviewing skills and grind leetcode after getting stood up for an interview? I  had an interview lined up with a pretty well known company but the recruiter scheduled a time but never called and never heard from her (this was the second time it happened with her too)

I just haven’t had any drive to grind since then. I have another interview coming up on friday, but I just can’t find the motivation to study. 

Anyone else have any experiences similar to this?"

The only problem is the location, distance to an actual city and my lease is going to be up in August. 

I know the next job I take won’t be as laid back as my current one. But I know I need to progress my career and I fear that I may pigeon hole if I stay here and become complacent."

woof_irl,ffw26mq,t1_ffvk1n5,1580281146.0,They become such a big part of your life too. I got my first dog almost 2 years ago and he’s still insanely happy to see me every single day. It’s such a warming feeling.

Oh, they don’t though. It’s extremely hive minded. Hence the reason why people are attacked for not completely shutting on trump. 

> That does not add to any discussion and is simply insulting people. That's the reason why at least I downvoted you.

I was trying to discuss with you that that guy at least can think on his own. Nice to know you admit to abusing Reddit TOS"
BoomersBeingFools,ffw12un,t1_ffw0z3i,1580279925.0,I’m not defending him. You don’t have to aggressively downvote. I’m just saying the guy talking to the creep obviously likes him over any of the main stream candidates or even orange man. He at least deserves that recognition.

It’s super nice for writing websites. It works really well with Twitter bootstrap also. Check out their website and widgets page for examples on how to get started. It’s super awesome. I’ve written close quite a bit with it."

This makes me sad. I haven’t used a step by step debugger since my sophomore year of college..  The closest thing I have to debugging is print statements on standard out. Before that, I would use LEDs on the arduino. I have almost forgotten how to use a debugger at this point."

cscareerquestions,ffu6h8m,t3_ev94r2,1580235508.0,"So looks like you’re just educated by programmer memes. 

There’s no easy way out here. You have to put in work to get a career. This industry has requirements for a reason. It seems like you’re trying to find the easy way to get a high paying job and that really isn’t possible given your lack of experience or education. Without having any education, you’re not going to even be looked at by bigger companies. 

I’d suggest going to school."

People want this country to be doing bad in every way possible because they’re so blinded by hatred of him.  People should want this country to do good no matter what. It’s fucked up that people can’t even say this country is doing good right now without getting attacked. 

This is a massive problem with both sides too. Not just liberals."

economy,ffs6jm4,t1_ffrnqbd,1580174373.0,"You’re getting downvoted because the majority of reddit is conditioned to downvote anything that remotely resembles positive talk about the country relating to trump.

popheads,ffqzbw3,t1_ffqxq7z,1580147022.0,You’re right. She isn’t. Gaga was different. Grande is just flash pop though. People are tired of hearing the same recycled themes in songs over and over. That genre has been pretty stable since 2014 ish
