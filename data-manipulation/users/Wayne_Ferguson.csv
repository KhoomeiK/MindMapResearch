trees,fepowyw,t1_fepotsw,1579326475.0,That’s a good ol’ firecracker. I use to make these for stealthy consumption around my unsuspecting parents.

You’d slam really hard into a practically solid surface, breaking most of your bones if we’re talking this specific crater. The inside of your lungs and throat would instantly start to char and evaporate, you’d burst into flames, and then the extreme heat difference would eventually just make you explode."

I’ve needed this sub. The amount of times I encounter 420 or 419 or 665/666 is starting to concern me."
antinatalism,fe1rjbb,t3_ence9t,1578830090.0,"I’m so upset that I’m not causing anymore suffering on this desolate planet.

My children are missing out on... so much. They’ll never get to experience sadness, anxiety, fear, pain, having to work their whole life, missed opportunities, sickness, constant societal stress, school related stress, financial stress, mental and physical ailments, insecurity, nausea, and just the pain of being alive in general?

That sucks."
antinatalism,fe1r0zu,t3_enclkd,1578829855.0,"It’s human nature to spread sadness and discomfort in any form. Sure, I spend 90% of my waking life wishing I was asleep, dead, or just focusing on of the many physical/mental ailments that make everyday just so great.

That’s why I’ve given up on being selfless or anything. Just use and fuck up what you’ve got; life is too unforgiving and short for you to waste time caring. We won’t get anything out of being a good person, anyway.

Either way, we’ll end up forgotten within less than a century."
antinatalism,fe1qimf,t3_end8hj,1578829653.0,"Oh. I got a lot of fun stuff. The most unstable emotional makeup, ridiculously easily triggered anxiety that often results in brief periods of extreme self deprecation and insecurity. Not for any reason, either. I could be fine one second, but as soon I’m slightly inconvenienced or upset, my emotions decide it’s time to go into overdrive.

Makes it really hard to make rational decisions, ever. And I can barely drive because of it, whereas most people think I’m just stupid and can’t control a car. I’m really just trying not to hurt anyone, but until I have my license it’s impossible to not drive without getting berated. Also goes for literally anything I do. “Just let me do it, you’ll mess it up.” That’s all I fucking hear. I’m slightly less skilled than the regular person, and that’s just not okay.

Can you live my life for me too? Obviously I’m messing that up too. Having bad hearing, shitty vision and fucked up coordination is definitely my fault. It’s like living in a shitty, staticky sitcom where the main character is universally hated."
antinatalism,fe1p9pr,t3_endmt5,1578829249.0,"Yeah, natural selection causes most births anyway. I’m pissed I was born, but I’m not going to create more mindless drones that could end up being a statistic.

It’s simply setting up your offspring for failure the second they’re conceived. Especially nowadays; who knows what will be left of the US after our little squabble with Iran."
antinatalism,fe1nraj,t1_fdz4cqs,1578828747.0,"You have to smell a disease to contract it, obviously. Jus wear a plague doctor mask everywhere you go.

Or you can just.. get vaccinated.

But that’s too easy. Having anti-vax parents is just hard mode."
