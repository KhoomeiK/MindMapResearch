EDIT: ACTUALLY. I have a strong argument against that!

Yellow and blue have a LOT of baggage going on. They were subservient to the will of white diamond, who of course was drunk on her own arrogance. Blue and yellow did even more harm when their beloved sister, pink, who they didn't always get along with but loved like a sister nonetheless, was murdered. They did this out of rage. The kind of rage you feel when you lost for revenge, they were heartbroken. I cannot blame yellow and blue for this.

This sub is clearly a response to toxic feminism and either revels in its absurdity for the sake of circlejerking or doesnt realize that the loud and outspoken are not the majority.
