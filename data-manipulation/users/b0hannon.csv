Also the SUV was fucking flying, and they didn’t even wait to see if the slower car in front of them would move over."

These cops are just one leg of a manipulative, lying, human-rights-encroaching government. You don’t need to defend them."

People of every age, 18 year olds to 70 year olds, all with their own sad stories and mental health problems, almost all of them had been in the military.

Overwatch,fffrkf6,t1_fffraji,1579890258.0,"I agree, if they wanted him to be a main tank they’d nerf his damage and give him more shield. I will say his kinetic grasp is underrated, it’s like a second shield for the team if you use it right."
JustBootThings,fffqrvl,t1_fffpxb3,1579889772.0,"And I disagree, I think texting teenagers who can’t be trusted to vote to try to get them to join the military is disrespectful. Sure, he’s just doing his job, but his job is shitty. 

You don’t have to be a psychologist to see the damage joining the military at a young age can do to people. Just look at this sub, so many brainwashed kids spewing hooah bullshit because their personality has been replaced with being a tool of the military."

iamatotalpieceofshit,ffa45yn,t1_ff7mx1b,1579727528.0,"The issue I think most people have with this sentiment is that it implies that only the “good” guys are armed. The citizens that have guns are the law-abiding and mentally competent, that only rebel against true oppression. In a perfect world, we’d be able to tell these upstanding citizens from everyone else, but often times screening is too lax and you end up with people with an arsenal of firearms that shouldn’t be allowed to carry a knife. 

Also, most of the people that are so terrified of losing their guns so they can defend themselves against the government are bootlickers who would defend a cop if they killed their brother. We have all these armed citizens but I don’t see any corrupt politicians or literal nazi police officers getting killed by the militia."
