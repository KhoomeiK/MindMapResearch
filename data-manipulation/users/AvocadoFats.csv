fatlogic,fdgz6a5,t1_fdgmk6v,1578411859.0,">Patel's advice is not to become obsessed with calories but to concentrate on the nutritional value of what we eat instead.

I don't understand the categorization of tracking calories as ""obsession."" The OP image beats the same drum. But it's not obsession—it's just simple awareness, right?

In the morning, I add up the calories from the meals I know I'm going to eat throughout the day and see what's left over so I know what I'm working with. It takes almost no effort and actually cuts back on how much mental energy I have to spend thinking about it at all."

Granted, he had no idea just how much I had been drinking before I decided to quit. But it’s still a goofy thing to say."

Then I quit drinking and 10 more pounds instantly disappeared and I was shocked at how much different that looks. 

It works in reverse, too. A couple pounds up sucks more than it should (thanks a lot, holidays)."
