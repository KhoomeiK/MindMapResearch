Esthetics,ffnxcl2,t3_eu1lge,1580071964.0,"I live in Utah where we also have a Master Esthetician license. I went through the basic and masters program, and don't regret anything. In this state, because of scope of practice laws, basic esties actually have a harder time finding good jobs other than waxing and lash extensions.

Also, if you ever think you might move out of state, it's good to have more hours trained"

PaleMUA,feiubrn,t3_epbygn,1579147424.0,"I Love Becca's undereye brightener. I got a small one with a kit for Black Friday, and I use it all the time, I hardly need any concealer under my eyes when I use it! It's a peachy color, so it works great with any undertones.
Hope this helps!"
Esthetics,feerlvy,t3_eorkv0,1579039720.0,"The terrible thing about hypopigmentation is that there really isn't anything that you can do for it. It usually means that the melanocyte has stopped producing melanin, and the light spot is the result."
PetTheDamnDog,fec1i2o,t3_eo9863,1578965279.0,Definitely looks familiar....
germanshepherds,fdive6d,t3_eljy8g,1578451899.0,"Yeah, it doesn't really ever stop. Sorry to break hearts, but they're so intelligent, they keep coming up with ways around the rules. You learn to think 3 steps ahead, or see indications...."

AmItheAsshole,fdcn2n8,t1_fdckczn,1578278997.0,"Absolutely true. If you get caught performing services in most states without being licensed, you can lose your opportunity to ever become licensed, as well as face hefty fines. It definitely all about public safety."
AmItheAsshole,fdc64a4,t3_ekicbi,1578267847.0,"NTA.

Bravo to you for being so willing to step up and be a father, even in a difficult situation. You gave him a truthful explanation without alienating your child against their mother, very important if she somehow decides to try to have a relationship with them in the future.

You sound like an amazing father, keep doing what you're doing."

antiMLM,fd0pdtq,t1_fd01pl1,1578121968.0,"FDA is actually trying to crack down on this. Technically, if she continues to advertise about curing or diagnosing, whichever company she works with can cut her off (technically, whether or not it actually gets done is another thing)."

AmItheAsshole,fd0khbb,t1_fcz6omn,1578120112.0,"I'm absolutely on board. Do I want kids? No, absolutely not. Do I like kids? Eh, for the most part, not really... Would I throw a party if my dogs got preggers? Hell, I throw parties for them just because I like them. This girl is actively pushing people into discomfort and even depression with her actions, and being a total d-bag while doing so.

NTA, get definitely have some sort of party with all of the people she's offended to celebrate the little ones who are either on the way or being wished for."
