I can't even tell you how many times I have had to stop at a red light on a near-empty road in the middle of the night, and **still** there was no fucking car coming/going."

cats,fd2my0o,t3_ejv6y1,1578149514.0,"Yep--whoever says that cats are cold never owned a cat and if they did, it probably was never treated very well.

My kitten Jovi (about 4.5 months old now) LOVES cuddles and giving me ""ear kisses"". When I wake up in the morning she is there chirping at me and almost literally crawling up my leg to nibble/lick my ear and purrs. I also can't seem to go anywhere without her being between my legs: I can't tell you how many times I've almost dislocated my knee or stepped on her because she just can't stay away from my legs when I walk ANYWHERE in the house... the bathroom, livingroom, kitchen, bedroom, my office, etc. Not to mention how she starts bawling whenever she gets the sense that she can't get to me if she wants to (i.e. bathroom door is closed and she starts crying and sticking her paw under the door)"
ADHD,fd2ma0s,t1_fd253xm,1578149243.0,"To be honest, how important these IDs were was not very strongly emphasized in the documentation. Some things that are not nearly as important as improper IDs being generated and they are underlined, emboldened, and red... whereas something that could potentially ruin the entire set of processes if not checked correctly is not. That's essentially why I didn't act as carefully as I did, because how significant these IDs were was never strongly emphasized. Also, I never knew that we couldn't run a certain process while others were running--I literally JUST learned that.

Also, there have been several times when I asked my lead about something that was not in the documentation and his response was ""Yeah, it's just really out of date...""

But yeah, regarding your response about the documentation, I think I may need to push re-creating the entire document more aggressively, as it does require a lot of re-work."

gaming,fcv3xeu,t1_fcuxfq2,1577994136.0,"Pretty much. PVP survival games that involve base-building are just not sustainable in the long-term if you're an adult who works 40+ hours a week, unless you dedicate all of your free time to it... which is definitely something I would NEVER do.

Nowadays I just stick to single-player games or games that don't require a lot of maintenance, like PUBG or Dota... something I can log on, play a few hours of, and then just hop off and do something else without worrying."
AskReddit,fcufjuc,t3_eixc75,1577979743.0,"It has worked in the sense that I have gone on dates and developed a few relationships from online dating.

In all of these relationships the ladies turned out to have severe mental health problems and/or very low self-esteem/self-worth. Either that, or the woman turned out to be using me for something... like a place to stay, money, drives, sex, etc.

Obviously I'm not going to paint every woman on these sites with the same brush and say they're all crazy, mooches, etc... but my experience has certainly provided me with some food for self-reflection and re-evaluation. The common denominator in all of these relationships is me, after all."

I am always looking at people--always. I have fallen back out of the gym for a few months but am going to get back into it shortly (had some financial issues) and I do look at people quite frequently, but very rarely is it to laugh at somebody or make fun of them and if it is, it's because they are just being a blatant moron with the equipment, or dressed very strangely for the occasion... like wearing nice jeans and shirts while working out instead of looser, ""proper"" clothes for the occasion."
