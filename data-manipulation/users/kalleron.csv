When you deliver, be courteous, and let him know this is not usually you would do for a colleague, as it requires some additional trust that you haven't built yet.

You can mention, while you appreciate he did trust you, you feel this is outside of normal scope of work, and would appreciate if you could focus on work related activities in the future.

As who calls whom, well he was ballsy, and you ate it.  Don't mention it, but in the future simply decline, or call from work phone. Next time let him know, you are not being reimbursed for work calls on your personal number, so you prefer to use company phone."

That's their entire job to put themselves in danger for the entertainment of others. No other skills or schooling required. They get paid well, and if they do their job well, they also don't get injured."
todayilearned,ffho3b9,t3_etgn3a,1579944799.0,"Why would he get anything? I would assume a stunt-man contract explicitly states that they MUST work in a dangerous environment, where permanent bodily harm is possible, and they cannot sue if it happens. They get paid handsomely anyways.

I think the production company didn't do their job properly. They have ""fixers"" to resolve issues like this, some do it in a way to discourage all future lawsuits as well."
