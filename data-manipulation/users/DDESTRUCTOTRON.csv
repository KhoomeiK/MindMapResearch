todayilearned,ffmgubv,t3_eu5wt2,1580054477.0,"Maybe it's because as a person in my mid twenties I've only worked in open office spaces, but imo it's not really that bad.


I find that being around others doing the same job makes me less likely to fuck around since there's eyes on me. Back when I had a cubicle at one of my first earlier jobs, the privacy was great but I always found myself getting distracted. Open spaces make me feel productive and I'm not even an extroverted person."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fcwh391,t1_fcw34tb,1578025451.0,"No one's really romanticizing. I'm just arguing that motive is imo what makes these two characters separate/non competitive. One can even go so far to say that I think the two shows are unique from each other, and don't need to be arbitrarily compared"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcw1g2p,t1_fcvxw4x,1578014938.0,"idk, does that really make him a serial killer then or just a sociopath? His end goal is not the killing itself, or even the feeling from it. It's just a means to an end for him. He's more excited about the manipulation and control which in my opinion makes him more of a murdering sociopath by definition"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcvrwop,t1_fcvrhub,1578008719.0,"S2 is great, but if you didn't like the first one I doubt you'll enjoy this one. It's very similar in terms of writing and the ""twist"" at the end"

They're supposed to be awful and CW-like though, is the thing. That's part of why Joe didn't like them in the first place. Glad you stuck it through to the end!"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcvpir2,t1_fcv9o7o,1578007184.0,"In my opinion the two are very different. Dexter was maniacal; he's killed over a hundred people on screen alone, not including the others alluded to off-screen and before season 1. Dude killed because he was addicted to it.


Joe on the other hand kills out of desperation. One can argue that this is an addiction too, but in my opinion it's more of a response to external developments rather than an addiction to doing something. The two are not really the same.


TL;DR there's no contest because one is a serial killer and the other is not"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fcvoygs,t1_fcvnh3r,1578006829.0,"What made season 1 of You bad in your opinion? I get having those feelings towards the later seasons of Bates Motel, but imo You isn't bad at all. At least not ""a dumpster fire""..."

Plus, as a player in a pirate adventure I would *really* like the idea of actually boarding and pillaging a ship. Let your players have fun with their bad sides! Reward things like betrayal and murder, get your friends to wild out a little bit lol"
