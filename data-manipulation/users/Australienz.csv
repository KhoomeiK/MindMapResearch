Acronyms are made of initials, but pronounced as a word. Like FIFA, or NASA.  

Initialisms are made of initials, but pronounced separately. Like BBC, or VFR."
Cringetopia,ffqfq4d,t1_ffqevqt,1580133253.0,"Pro tip: When talking to amateurs about a technical subject, always use the full term, because nobody will understand what any of the initialisms mean. It’s much easier to understand Visual Flight Rules compared to VFR, because VFR means literally nothing to anyone not in the industry, or knowledgeable about the subject.  

I know you mostly did, but this goes for everyone else too. This problem is especially common in military threads."
Cringetopia,ffqel5s,t1_ffqcl10,1580132259.0,"Cringe subs *always* end up right wing. I’ve seen it happen a few times on reddit, first  with r/Cringe and then r/CringeAnarchy, and now r/Cringetopia. The entire reason r/CringeAnarchy was made was because r/Cringe mods ended up getting sick of it and started changing rules.

woahdude,ffq8op9,t1_ffq2k79,1580126104.0,"This is the second time I've seen this dude posted in 5 minutes. Are we karma whoring, or is he?"
IdiotsInCars,ffpvq52,t1_ffpvbp7,1580107553.0,"Ah well, shit happens. If people can't put 2 and 2 together, then my joke has failed. Not a big deal. I'd expect you to understand it though TBH, considering it's your username."
IdiotsInCars,ffpv880,t1_ffpuu92,1580106992.0,It's quite obviously a joke. I'm not literally saying you were in the KKK. Just like your username doesn't *actually*mean you are. It was just a reference to your username.
