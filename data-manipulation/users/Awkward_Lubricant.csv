My point there was just replying to you saying that the debt accrued was during a booming economy, I was noting that Trump's administration has directly impacted that ""positively"" and without those interventions the debt would be much, much greater.  Trump's debt creation is well behind the previous administration (and the prior one when looking at relative figures).

I don't like Trump, I don't support what he's doing, but I'm also not biased to any party which I get is a rarity so people assume I'm a pro-MAGA tard if I correct misinformation.

I was laughing at the emotionally derived conclusion that the Dems are responsible with their debt creation unlike the fast and loose GOP.  But since you want to argue, which is better: $3T in 3 years or $14T in 8 years? And before ""but muh economy"" you may want to consider *why* the party is still going (not saying it's a good thing but the current administration has directly ""stimulated"" the economy significantly).  Also consider the debt servicing required..  For the record imo both parties are a dumpster fire at this point, but I get that people are biased to their party and have to see everything through their respective glasses...for example:
