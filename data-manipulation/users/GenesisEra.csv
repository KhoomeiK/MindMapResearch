For instance, to use Mahouka as a example, [Mahouka spoilers](/s ""what laypeople see in Miyuki Shiba on the surface level is she is a siscon who wants to f*** her brother Tatsuya, and what the details say is that she owes her life to her brother after an incident that would have killed her was it not for her brother being overpowered af. So, instead of being the limited power limiter her family magi-genetically-engineered her to be, she is now devoted to Tatsuya in heart and soul, which she expresses by wanting to f*** him."")"

Because, in some cases, a boring truth is still more valuable than an exciting and entertaining lie."
anime,ffyiv34,t1_ffycn4c,1580347474.0,"> The problem with saying ""maybe the curtains are just blue"" in response to someone deep diving a random detail in a creative work is that sometimes the analysis just took more effort than the actual creative element, giving the impression that an equal amount of work was put in by the creator to include it. There are times when this simply isn't the case, and a detail can mean everything someone interprets it to mean without any need for the creator to have put the same amount of thought into constructing it.

I once read a two-parter essay on why Rowlet falling asleep in the middle of the League battle between Ash's Rowlet and Hau's Decuideye was a good character moment for Rowlet's character development when it was clearly meant to be a comedic fakeout that just didn't vibe well with everyone who actually saw it.

* Basically half a Precure episode
* G Gundam being referenced with Love-Love Continental Crush and TRio mechs based on both versions of the Devil Gundam,
* A Super Sentai-like set up in the Ultra Guardians minus the action and plus more gags, but not in the endearing way like Akibaranger or Twintails did it,
* **20+ anime references in the school play episode** thanks to Jessie's rewrite and then they forgot the plot of the original play
* Rayquaza vs Deoxys used as clickbait for the Kartana episode while Kartana itself goes around cutting shit up and quoting Miyamoto Musashi in reverse-speak
* A general increase in ""Ash = buttmonkey"" approach to humor in later parts of SM

Also, while the Litten/Stoutland stuff in early SM was good [episode 79 of SM](/s ""Minior didn't stick around long enough for us to get attached to before it 'didn't feel so good' - very hard to feel emotionally attached to the Rock/Flying equivalent of a mayfly, much less when Rayquaza flies in at the end of the same episode to eat meteor dust."")
