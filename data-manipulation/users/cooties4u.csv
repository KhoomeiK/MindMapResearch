If you like the wtf kinda read. Try something when he was younger. Carrie, pet cemetery etc.
If you like something thoughtful before the wtf try something when he is much older.

Like insomnia, sleeping beauty, finders keepers, under the dome etc.

Fyi, saw a new theory on the sinking. Experts and witness say they had a coal fire that was burning for weeks and may have soften some the steel in the bulkheads. They said that I think the fifth was the weakest link and it was holding the water back until the weeken steel gave way due to pressure from water.

Fyi, the coal stores were three stories high. So the strategy for putting out a coal fire is to find the coal burning first of all, and throw it in the boiler.
But there was.so much coal they couldnt locate it."
