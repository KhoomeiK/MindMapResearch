It’s a beautiful relaxation game, while also taking seemingly insurmountable tasks and teaching the player to break it down into manageable steps, which is an awesome life skill. It’s pure genius."

Animemes,ffgxo0c,t1_fffm4s8,1579917711.0,"Fair. But we have to take those slayers testaments with a grain of salt. Remember: they’re written from the perspective of the demons. If you had a seemly unstoppable force killing you and your friends, then you’d try to put it in terms you’d understand. The demons say he’s full of “ravenous hatred”. But I don’t think he hates. The man collects toys and reads anger management self-help books. Not to mention saving Vega. The demons use “hatred” because that’s a concept they can understand really well. There may have been some folks in hell DoomGuy didn’t kill because they helped him or were also fighting the hordes. In fact we know this to be true as the knight sentinels met him there. The wretch may be a demon that turned against his own kind. It’s not who you are, it’s what you do."
Animemes,ffgwkd3,t1_fffn8ev,1579916888.0,"That depends on who the “wretch” is. It was forged in hell, but saying “he wore the crown of the knight sentinels” suggests it was made by them."

DungeonsAndDragons,ffewg5z,t3_et8s20,1579868361.0,"Item: commandable mimic. The mimic in its docile state  is indistinguishable from an ordinary object. The counterpart or “base” must be held by the mimics commander. This part changes along with the mimic, adapting any disguise it’s counterpart takes. Once deployed, it will detach from its base and attack anyone the wielder of its base chooses. If it’s HP is depleted it will return to its docile state, and will be redeployable 24 hours after reattachment to its counterpart. If the wielder looses grip or drops the base while the mimic is active, the mimic will see that person as its enemy and will attempt to kill them before attempting an escape with its base. For mimic stats, attacks and abilities, see Monster Manual.

I think we should outlaw straight marriage. You can only marry someone of the same gender now. That includes the all of the genders on the spectrum. I think we should be letting in immigrants and force all the white people to move out of the country and give them their old jobs. And finally I think everyone must masturbate to the constitution at least twice a day. Do that and we’ll have a perfect country. Hail Sobek!"
UpliftingNews,ff6hqqr,t1_ff6fcz6,1579627460.0,I read up a little. It looks like the protested bill is about universal background checks. That doesn’t seem like a terrible idea to me. But there could be more to it that I missed.

There is hardly a room or hall in that game that doesn’t have its own story to it, and by the sound of it, the same idea will continue in eternal. Again, it’s all circumstantial evidence, but signs certainly point that way."

But not everyone has had your experience with it. And waiting on new tech for it to improve isn’t a bad idea. Just... keep having fun, and if they do continue, I might check it out again. Probably not as I’m not a huge fan of streaming services in general- I like to own my games. All the same. I hope you continue to have fun with that ten gigabytes per second. That was it. Right? Probably."
HazbinHotel,fdh4gpy,t1_fdh1m8v,1578415176.0,"Yeah I... I get how fast of an internet you need... I do. But not everyone has that, and between chrome cast issues, lag, and the small library, it’s not at a point where I’d recommend it to anyone. The tech  has potential. But google isn’t a company that will, or even should, push this tech forward. Remember google glass? I have a feeling this is going to be very similar: a one off that is a nice little idea but will fade as the tech develops to allow for a bigger market."
HazbinHotel,fdh11m3,t1_fdgze3z,1578413053.0,"Sure, but a chrome book could run a lot of indie and retro games and all you’d need is a mouse. That alone would give you a bigger library than what stadia currently has. The latency issues stand though. Not everyone has that much internet to spare, especially in rural areas, or when sharing a router. But if you want a “triple A” game for cheep then stadia is not a bad option. I will say that it has the a lot of potential. But given the portability/cheapness/accessibility and indie/exclusive market for the switch, it’s not the best console option. I’d even rate the ps4 over it mainly for the exclusives. It’s doing something new and different and at a decent price which is cool. But the library, the tech, or even the company is not at a place where I’d recommend it to anyone."
TechNewsToday,fdgv4h7,t1_fdgi270,1578409086.0,Nah. More like a windows surface and a joycon. They had the tech. Duct taping them together wasn’t too much of a stretch.
TechNewsToday,fdguydr,t1_fdgh1vf,1578408968.0,Right? At least Nintendo learned about the hard corners cramping hands from the 3ds. These folks put one right in the middle of the controller. O.o
HazbinHotel,fdgixra,t1_fdginbg,1578398708.0,It’s nice if you can afford the internet and pc capable of running it. But at that point you might as well just game on pc. All the other options have latency or stream quality issues. I don’t think the tech has caught up with the idea. It’s not bad for a casual audience but for people who game a lot it’s not the best option.
