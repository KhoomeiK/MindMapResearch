I have been trying to transcend the ego since around 2003, but honestly all I can share is my experience.

I learned what you learned, that you have to focus on one branch at once instead of the whole tree all at once. Over time, I realized that you have to focus on the leaves and not the branches. And then the details of each leaves. The more details the better, and the best way is to catch the ego in the act.

I have caught my ego many times and thought, ""this is my ego right now"" but I will still feel upset. I will watch it as my lips move during an argument. I'm still less emotional than most, I guess, but I am far from enlightened.

Passions can be temporary. My first passion in the work world was web design, but I look back on it with bitterness. I couldn't find work, but then when I did, it was low paying and unfullfilling. That was at about 21. Then I had a kind of quarter life crises or something and wanted adventure and to be outdoors. I played with the idea of being a state park ranger and finally started taking school seriously.

A few years later, I found fulfilment helping the elderly with assisted living. It was low paying and I couldn't pay back about $5,000 I had in debt that would never go away. My passion for the outdoors and adventure led me to go hiking almost everyday. Because I was not pursuing money, I never even did the research into how much a state park ranger makes until some bitch at a party told me that no woman would want to date a guy who lived in the woods. So when I finished my AA I went into training as an EMT. As i began leaning about it I felt like that was my true purpose.

But no, I started having epilepsy in 2010. Life really sucked after that. The thing I thought was my purpose was ripped away from my future. Not only that, but i lost my current assisted living shuttle bus job. They took away my license and I was told I may never get it back. Luckily I got it back again 6 months later.

What was I supposed to do now? A friend told me since I was so poor, I could go to a university with a free ride like he did. So I did, and chose Environmental Science. I'm passionate about nature and the environment, and I desperately require a purpose in job. Making money for a company is unfullfilling, so I am trying to work for the private sector. Still trying to break in, though."
