dogs,ffic80f,t1_ffi1jx9,1579970409.0,Very insightfull observations!!
relationship_advice,fffwpzs,t3_etbkyi,1579893470.0,"It is very painful to lose anyone and that includes a pet. My deepest condolences to you!  Pet loss is a disenfranchised form of grief. In other words; grieving for a pet isn't generally an accepted form of grief. I have known the kindest people you will ever meet, but when it comes to a person's pet dying, they just don't understand what the fuss is about?!
However, it is clear from what you have written that your boyfriend should have at least kindly acknowledged what your dog meant to you.

Admittedly, the first week is absolutely the most difficult! Like any other 'wound' it takes time to heal. You will always remember your precious dog, but time helps to lessen the sharpest of pain, of which the death of a pet is one. Take time for yourself and know that there are many,many animal lovers out there who know and have felt that kind of sadness. Best of luck to you."
news,ffegzgg,t3_et1rmf,1579847630.0,I am so outraged that our laws still do not have the power to put individuals who abuse our animals behind bars! Especially when we know there is a high correlation between abuse of animals and that of humans!!
relationship_advice,ffcqm4s,t3_esufvn,1579805192.0,"Firstly, you are the only who can answer this question. Secondly, it is obvious to me that he may be capable of becoming a physician, but his passions lie elsewhere. As you mentioned politics  being one of them. I have been witness to people who went into medicine to please their parents, but ended up miserable.
It appears as though your paths are diverging. You both might be happier with a temporary separation where you can get in touch with your true feelings and then decide whether to take that other fork in the road or attempt to love one another for who you are. You never know, he may become a political analyst in the near future and the best stay at home Dad: the envy of all your colleagues!"
dogs,ff0c3o7,t3_er09c4,1579467499.0,I agree with the other comments. After due diligence get that boy home with you! You would have lost that 'energy connection' to him if he had not been meant for you. Go get him!!
canada,fee1nxh,t1_fedp37g,1579024537.0,"Bravo! Have you noticed that cowardly criminals target ""gun free zones."" Weapons are used for hunting, target practice and personal defense in people who obtain their fire arms legally. There are virtually no crimes committed by people with legal carry permits. Defending oneself, family and friends is a first amendment right upheld by the U.S constitution. 

There are numerous cases where innocent lives have been saved by merely pulling out a handgun without using it. In this day and age when one reads about Buddhist monks protecting themselves, temples and their way of life by being armed and using their weapons, you begin to realize how important proper self- defense really is!  Also, as you know 'carrying' is a very personal decision. Not everyone wishes to carry, but there are those who do. Thank goodness!"
dogs,fe4w5tr,t3_enrren,1578863356.0,Super fun and creative idea!!!
dating_advice,fd2ymo3,t3_ejsx5q,1578153004.0,What you state concerning modern dating makes perfect sense! You are not alone in your beliefs !!
dogs,fc7fkud,t3_egiu4r,1577505935.0,"That is very true. Pets in the eyes of the law, thus far depending on where you reside,  have no legal rights. They are considered property, as would a piece of furniture. If the damage is visible, one may seek legal recourse.

I trust the day will come when animals will be given basic rights. We already know that there is a high correlation between harming an animal and having the capacity to hurt a human being.

One day we will realize that everyone on this planet has the role of speaking up for an injured or abused animal.  Ultimately, we are stewarts of all creatures great and small!"
montreal,fbg7j8d,t3_ed8a50,1576838455.0,Mais oui!
