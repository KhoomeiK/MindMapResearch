That 1/3 and 3/20 is among dogs WITH FOOD ALLERGIES. Which are rare. It absolutely does not indicate 1/3 dogs have beef allergies. At all. In any way.

Of course allergies are something to watch for. But there's no reason to advise a healthy dog to avoid chicken because of a condition facing 1% of the dog population.

I'd go with prescription kibble in a second over a homemade diet for a dog with medical needs like this. Prescription diets are not at all full of ""low quality processed garbage."" In fact, prescription diets undergo some of the most rigorous testing out there to ensure they're nutritionally complete and palatable. 

Having a specially formulated diet that's well formulated by experts, and is demonstrated to be  nutritionally complete is the best way to ensure your dog lives a long life with this condition.

There are no dogs that can be completely alone for two days straight while you travel. It's not an option.

12 hours is too long for dogs to be alone for without a dog walker or other solution to break up their day.

All dogs need to go outside and relieve themselves in the morning; waking up earlier with a dog is inevitable.

Some barking is inevitable, training is a necessary part of owning a dog, and any dog that doesn't require regular grooming will shed. You can pick: a coat that maintains itself by shedding, or a coat that you maintain by grooming. There are no non-shedding dogs that don't need to be groomed. Even dogs that do maintain their own coat by shedding need basic care like teeth brushing, ear cleaning, nail trimming etc. 

Finally, with any dog you have to be willing to manage problems. You can limit certain problems by going to a reputable breeder and selecting a breed that isn't predisposed to whatever issue you don't want. But expecting a breed with no problems at all isn't realistic.

There are very few dog breeds that would be okay with 30 minutes of exercise in the evening and that's it. Given the rest of the issues above, it leads me to believe a dog just isn't a fit.

That opinion is not shared by the experts on this issue. Vet nutritionists and cardiologists [widely recommend switching](https://ccah.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk4586/files/inline-files/UPDATEDucd-diet-and-dcm-handout.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2_RSRJ2nL2RFzAxKHVl2dnB0Euesh3koM6gKUiYhKe9Pb4SfwiifunRVU) out of caution precisely because we do not have enough information at this point."

dogs,ff9p72d,t1_ff9okcx,1579717807.0,">You don't know my sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, socioeconomic group, religion, or disability status, or anything about those close to me, so you have no idea what ""slurs"" I've heard.

Nor have I ever presumed to have done so. I never suggested you've never heard a slur so I don't know why you're going on about this. I did suggest you don't have empathy for people who are affected by this particular slur. That remains true and the evidence is this long string of replies. Better would've just been to stop responding, or even better yet, say ""sorry I won't do it again""

> As long as you let the words people say make you sad, overwhelm you, or frighten you, you're giving these people power over you.

It's incredibly naive to suggest that using slurs against people shouldn't affect them. Sure, we're all trying to get to the place where words don't have power over us. Over here in the real world, they still do. Good people limit their use of words that historically have power over marginalized populations that already face systemic barriers in their daily life. They don't intentionally double down on them because they can. 

Me telling you you're being intentionally offensive shouldn't offend you and get you in a tizzy defending yourself, but it does because everyone reacts to people. 

It is not your job to be my life coach. Your job is to not be a complete dick to people with ASD who have directly asked you to stop. 

You've put a lot of time and energy into defending your use of a slur. 
Wouldn't your energy be better put to use just NOT saying it? Seriously, you seem like YOU are the one walking around ready to lecture someone who takes offense to your offensive language. Stick a fork in your own eye. 

>Now you may get some sort of validation by spending your life walking around on the verge of righteous outrage all the time, but honestly all you're doing is sticking a fork in your own eye.

Telling you that you're using an offensive slur isn't walking around on the verge of righteous outrage all the time, but I dearly appreciate your attempt to ""control what I'm thinking"" as you would say."

I genuinely don't mean to be glib, but this isn't a particularly healthy response to jealousy. We all experience unhealthy reactions sometimes, but if this is truly affecting your life to this degree, I'd highly recommend therapy.

These companies repeatedly make sketchy af claims that dodge the fact that they don't meet these guidelines while claiming that they do. I had a back and forth on this sub just a couple weeks ago with a representative who suddenly stopped replying when I pointed out they didn't meet guidelines they were outright saying they met. 

For example:

One guideline is that they have to have at least one (but preferably more) FULL TIME veterinary nutritionist OR PhD in animal nutrition on staff formulating their diets. 

They say 

>""We have worked very closely with a Ph.D. Animal Nutritionist who either formulates or reviews our diets. He has spent more than 25 years formulating diets for dogs and cats and our relationship with him goes back more than fifteen years. In addition, he has published numerous peer-reviewed articles on dog and cat nutrition in scientific journals including the Journal of Nutrition and the British Journal of Nutrition.

That is sneaky language around the fact that this guy is not on full time, probably not even on staff, just a consultant (which WSAVA guidelines are VERY CLEAR about not being sufficient because it means supply chain and manufacturing are not monitored by an expert). 

Another one: 

WSAVA guidelines dictate that the diets are made in the brand's own facilities. 

They say:

>Our diets are produced at a combination of our own plants and co-manufacturing partners

Those co-manufacturing partners do not meet the guidelines, and open up quality control and supply chain issues.

Another: WSAVA guidelines dictate the brand MUST do scientific research published in peer reviewed journals. Here's Wellness' answer:

>What kind of research has been conducted? As the results published in peer-reviewed journals? Before our diets are commercialized we ensure that they meet high standards for digestibility, starch gelatinization, stool performance, palatability and urine pH for cats diets. We have also conducted research focused on protein digestibility, blood glucose response and weight loss. None of the research was conducted with the intent of publishing, yet the intent was and is to ensure that we provide diets that perform to our high standards.

So that's a big fat ""No"" on that very important guideline. It's a lot of text justifying the fact that it's a no, but it's a no. But they still front like they meet them. It's sneaky and makes me trust them even less.

They are intentionally trying to deceive us into believing they meet these guidelines, but their own answers reveal that they don't. They are counting on consumers seeing the page and feeling comfortable with it, and it's deceptive and shitty."

Lots of marketing, no science.

Like I said, the ONLY brands that meet WSAVA guidelines right now are Purina, Royal Canin, Hills, Iams and Eukanuba. Hopefully other diets will get on board, but for now those are it.

I personally feed my dog Purina Pro Plan sensitive skin and stomach variety and he does really well on it, but he's done great on Royal Canin in the past as well."
