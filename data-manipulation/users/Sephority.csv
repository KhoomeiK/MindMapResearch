Traits of living things are the ability grow and develop, use energy, reproduce, be made of cells, respond to its environment, and adapt.

But the behavior is so incredibly hateful. I'm not comparing toxicity between subs just calling out how psycho people can be about how much they loathe kids. It's irrational to be this angry at kids that have no choice in the matter, and parents that want kids and teach them well.

Do you really think that a baby past 3 months is not alive? Because that's just bad logic. They are definitely a living thing. It's not like slipping out of a vagina suddenly makes you alive.
