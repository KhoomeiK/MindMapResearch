wokekids,ffn0onk,t1_ffmtsor,1580060768.0,Talking to a child in full sentences and “talking like they have a PhD “ is not the same thing.
facepalm,ff1uhmp,t3_eqrr9e,1579486467.0,The provocation was the unwelcome interruption.
facepalm,ff1la5h,t1_ff0nhu4,1579481016.0,"You did misunderstand. I wasn’t there so I can’t speak to how it went down. We’re way beyond here-say at this point. 

I also can’t speak to how you hear their words in your head, and unless you’re a close friend of this guy you can’t either. I don’t read racism in to it. I read people pushing back. 

Racism is a system of inequality where one group asserts power over another. That doesn’t work here. We both know the simplistic “dislike of someone for their race” definition doesn’t work."
facepalm,ff0lh4d,t1_ff0elj0,1579469983.0,"I said maybe it was a misfire. We weren’t there. Also, they didn’t know who the hell he was. He admits he butted in to someone else’s convo. 

Your argument seems to be wether their reaction is valid or not. You can’t be flipping back and forth."
facepalm,fezw575,t1_fezimph,1579462431.0,"The argument is not the Solomon was attempting to “mansplain”, the argument is the validity of the reaction or where the reaction comes from.  

Imagine the roles were reversed and your whole life women expected you to stop and listen intently any time they decided to talk. Worse, they routinely covered topics in depth that they assumed you didn’t know “for background” without asking if you wanted the information or what your knowledge level was already. Also, if you politely told them you didn’t want to talk about it you were talked down to or called, at best “ungrateful” or at worst “a bitch” all because you wanted to have your own conversation. 

Now, imaging some men started standing up for themselves and pushing back. You’ve heard about this, and it feels liberating. Finally, despite the insistence that your gender should just “shut up and listen” some of you are standing up for yourselves. 

Are there some misfires? Sure. Obviously the one above sounds like one to us. However, that doesn’t disqualify the movement."

Kentucky,fexdql1,t1_few8bgp,1579429297.0,"Also Logan here. Yeah, no love for Missouri."
AskReddit,fex7ghb,t1_fewmk6y,1579426014.0,Is this the green space rabbit show?
facepalm,fex76hp,t1_fewznru,1579425796.0,"Really?  You saying “without a provocation” is pretty presumptive. You haven’t lived their lives. 

I am a 40-something white male, and I’m guilty as fuck of mansplaining in my life. I grew up where the women were taught to keep quiet and the men were taught to be super assertive. If a girl asks a question out loud it’s your chance to show off your knowledge. You could impress people you don’t know about how knowledgeable you are. 

I completely get the objection to some random guy offering an unsolicited opinion. Does it suck they missed out on meeting someone cool that you and I would love to meet? Hell yeah. Do they likely deal with this shit “all the time”. Also hell yeah."
Noom,fejto89,t3_epjpt5,1579185592.0,"Yo, I didn't do it for Noom because it wasn't around back then, but back in 2015 I gave up my Diet Mt Dew habit.  I drank 3-5 a day, bought by the case.  I quit cold turkey and went to hot mint and lemon teas.  I haven't had one since.  They still tempt me, trust me, but you can do it."
IsItBullshit,febmhse,t3_eo3opt,1578960411.0,"First of all, if your cover letter can't be read in under a minute then something is wrong.

Second, I can scan your resume for relevant details and make a snap judgement on your technical skills with a word processor in like 2 seconds.

Want to get me to stop and read? Make it interesting.  I can't tell you how many boring-ass, internet-copied ""objectives"" I've read at the top of the page.  However, if you use some buzz words from my industry and show some basic knowledge of the company or industry that you're applying to then I'mma spend some time.

No one ever sets out to work in my field out of school, but if you're applying to work for me *that's exactly what you're hoping for.*  Say it.  I don't care if the job I'm offering isn't in your list of ""Top 5 Career Choices"".  If you want to work here, then WANT to work here.  If you don't, it will show through."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,fd39689,t1_fd3793a,1578155917.0,"Right, after being treated like second class citizens for most of America’s history it’s the responsibility of every person of color to make sure you’re comfortable. All of them, each an emissary of their race, to make sure you, a white dude, like them."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,fd2yzll,t3_ejxdef,1578153176.0,"Jesus. As a fellow southerner, you know damn well how blacks are treated in the south. The daily racism and knowledge of how they’re talked about behind their backs would make anyone bitter and distrustful. 

It’s a systemic issue. For you to take it personal is ridiculous."
AskReddit,fbgda4c,t1_fbfii1q,1576845668.0,"Honestly? This would be torture to me. I don’t think I would make it. I once went solo camping and didn’t make it 24 hours, and I still had my phone and internet and apps."
