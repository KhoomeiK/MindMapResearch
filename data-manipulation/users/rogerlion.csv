I happen to think my dog is really pretty, too. My favorite thing is when we walk by people and they smile at my dog. I love knowing that she makes other people happy just by being so damn cute. We now live on an island whose canine inhabitants are almost entirely the local breed or mixed with it. I am certain my pup is the prettiest and most unique dog on the entire island.

Teachers,fcwvv4e,t1_fcwnr5w,1578039785.0,I don’t know about Dubai specifically but I know at least one gay couple in international schools. I’m sure there are places that are better than others. Here in South Korea they will grant a same-sex spouse a family visa to move here.
Teachers,fcss9gy,t1_fcs9z3j,1577923822.0,Yes! My elementary school has two learning support teachers. Not all schools provide support for students with special needs but the good ones do.
Teachers,fcpvqmj,t1_fcpuzjl,1577873180.0,It seems to start earlier every year. I thought recruitment in October was almost exclusively for admin positions?
Teachers,fcp97yu,t1_fcp77r6,1577854786.0,It depends on the school and country/visa requirements. You usually need a teaching certificate from any state and it helps to have a few years of experience.
Teachers,fcp7sxn,t1_fcp72a7,1577853347.0,"Most contracts are for 2 years. I’m making enough now to make large payments to my student loans while supporting my husband on just my salary, and we just took a 2 week trip to a tropical island."
Teachers,fcp7fte,t1_fcp6kep,1577852985.0,"Thailand is hot all the time, but you get used to it. There’s delicious food and cheap shopping everywhere but also poverty and crime. I was single and lived right downtown in Bangkok and it was one of the best times of my life. 

I live in a rural area in South Korea. There isn’t as much variety as far as food or shopping goes. It’s a quiet, family-centered type of life. There are four seasons here. Lots of outdoorsy things to do.  I think it would be more fun to live in Seoul but that’s a personal preference. SK is super safe."
Teachers,fcp3kmy,t1_fcp2ryk,1577849400.0,South Korea. I’ve also taught in Thailand and China. China wasn’t too bad. It’s really safe there. Every country has its problems. I moved to Thailand in the middle of a military coups but was reassured that it would barely affect anything as they were used to having them. It was fine.

Teachers,fcozvyj,t1_fcoyqdd,1577846229.0,I have my PYP cert but there are lots of schools that don’t require it. I worked for a school that was in the process of accreditation and they paid for my online certification.
Teachers,fcovu1m,t1_fcotdwf,1577842966.0,"Not important at all. I teach in English, just like I did in the states. Even for daily life in the community, most people learn a few words of the local language after they move to their new place but it’s not expected or needed. I have people and resources available to me through my school if I need to do something that requires using the local language."
