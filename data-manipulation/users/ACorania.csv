I rush down to the station and am the only one who responded so far (it was prime New Years' Eve Party time). That's when the rumbly tummies started. I figured I could hold it though... so I started calling around to the people qualified to drive. Finally got one on his way but he was still a half-hour out. This was fine as I heard an engine from the district whose area this was go in route (later turned out it was just one guy going by himself in the engine... drives me nuts). It gave me time to hit the head though and blow out a deuce in the toilet.

In many places in order for you to drive you have to be clean. Even if they don't test if there is an accident they may then test and if you are positive at all (not just at the time you were driving) you will be in for a world of hurt. 

Likewise if there is an issue with patient care and you are found to have been using you are likely to lose your coverage from being sued.

I would suggest that you are also being an asshole to yourself if you agree to go on a vacation which you are not in a position to afford. It's clear you have not combined money at this point (which is fine), but that means you shouldn't start acting like you have a claim on his money.

The responsible and kind thing to do would be to just be upfront and honest that you can't afford this right now and let him know you would need to cancel going on the vacation. If he offers to pay, cool! That is his choice with his money, but don't expect him to. If the offer is extended be appreciative and graciously accept with a thank you."

You eavesdropped on a conversation between someone and their healthcare provider. That is a confidential conversation and protected by law (in the US at least). It was a massive invasion of privacy and a huge asshole move to just keep listening. 

You compounded being the asshole in that instance by telling your SO. That was not your place and not your information. To give you perspective, if you had been a healthcare provider you could have lost your license... it is that bad.

While I agree with your sentiment that a flag should be treated with respect, the fact is that it isn't your property. Taking other people's property is not right. Someone may be trying to make a specific statement with keeping the flag in that condition, a statement that you and I don't agree with, but them having that right is one of the things that flag stands for."

Someone that chooses to drink and drive is doing something horrible. They are disregarding and putting in danger the life of others. It deserves a far harsher sentence than it gets in most places.

What she is getting mad about is that she thinks it should stay clean and every time it is made to be unclean she has to spend time to then clean it up. 

Think about when you are given a chore that you don't want to do or it is something you don't care about. It's annoying and you don't want to do it. Then once you do it, someone comes along and undoes it and you are told it to do it again. You'd be pissed, right? Then they keep doing that over and over and each time it is more and more work for you. It would build up. This is what is happening to your grandmother. 

In response to situation that is really frustrating to her, you were dismissive and said that you didn't care about her time and effort. It was cruel and disrespectful. 

Want to make it right? Go apologize, say that you didn't realize that she cared about it staying clean so much and ask what you can do to help. That would go a long way."
IsItBullshit,fdku1r9,t3_elotrg,1578511156.0,"I mean, technically it is true. It is not healthy to vape. 

That said, it is true that none of the vaping deaths are being attributed to commercial products. 

The alveoli in your lungs can stay open because they are coated in a surfactant. You can think of a surfactant like soap. As you know, soap breaks down oils... it's kind of like they negate each other and can then be washed away with water. But in your lungs if you breath in oil they just negate each other and the alveoli are going to have a harder time staying open, you also need the surfactant to help allow oxygen to move across into the blood... so basically breathing in an oil is bad and will degrade your lung function. 

As others have said, if you are vaping a nicotine product, then you are taking a pesticide into your lungs that is know to cause problems and is addictive... but it is probably less problematic than cigarettes.

I say probably, because vaping product haven't been around long enough for long term studies to be done. It doesn't mean there aren't all sorts of long term consequences, nor does it mean there are... it means we don't know. 

As a good rule of thumb, breathing any particulate matter into your lungs isn't going to be good for you."
