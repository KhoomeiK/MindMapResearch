YouShouldKnow,fgyqwnz,t1_fgypiz6,1581186044.0,"I agree that coronavirus was not named in the thread. However, the level of protection an N95 provides (thus the 95 part for 95%) would not be an appropriate PPE  for a truly airborne infection as you are allowing particles through.

For droplet precautions, both mask do their job. N95 is a better mask, yes, but for general public use against influenza type illnesses, the surgical mask is easier to use and will provide protection. N95 masks are easy to put on wrong and can have seal issues and since the surgical mask also works for influenza, it is also recommended. 

If we are talking about a threat that lives in the air, you will need something much stronger than either mask."
YouShouldKnow,fgylymd,t1_fgxuk3q,1581184668.0,"We are talking about the coronavirus which is spread through person to person coughing droplets or touch like most influenza. It is not airborne. The surgical mask works fine for this. This isn’t floating around in the air.

If it’s In the air N95 is not appropriate either, you’ll need a heavier respirator."
YouShouldKnow,fgw85ba,t3_f0n4sq,1581157982.0,"The problem with N95 masks is you usually have to be fit tested for them. Typical influenza infection control methods: (hand washing, not touching face) still work best but a surgical mask does protect against droplets. 

You are correct that an N95 mask provides better protection but this is assuming fit testing and the person using the right mask. For non health care providers a surgical mask is easier to use."

CanadaPolitics,ffcz64b,t1_ffcv0ls,1579810270.0,"Many management jobs require some sort of bachelors or master of arts training. Education that centres around creative, research based, and constructive thinking has a value for specific jobs that education that merely trains you to do tasks does not have. Having someone who knows how to research and communicate effectively is a highly valuable skill. 

While I agree that not everyone should seek a BA as we need skilled labour as well, to imply that a BA has no value is simply insanity and speaks to a lack of research on the topic outside of confirmation bias and anecdotal evidence. 

You can have too many people with BAs in the work force just as you can have too many people with labour skills training - the trick is a healthy balance. Education gives people options beyond their skillset training into other careers.

Many jobs require a 4 year degree as a minimum in government, healthcare, business and more. This on top of the value and advancement opportunities a degree will have in jobs in military, fire, police, ehs, and many business.

firstaid,ffcs5se,t1_ffc7bk2,1579806152.0,"The video attempts to show a version of cpr to an unresponsive animal that is supposedly in arrest. To assume the average user will investigate into the comment section and learn that: the dog was not in arrest, this is ineffective cpr and would not save a dogs life, and there are proper ways of doing cpr (not shown) on animals is a lot to ask of people.

I know the concept of bad cpr is better than no cpr but this is not even a compression ratio that would be any sort of help other than being a pain stimulus. Therefore it is damaging misinformation to the public."
firstaid,ffc5k6z,t3_esgugm,1579792038.0,The top comment in this post you shared states it is not cpr. Please delete this and help stop the spread of bad information it can save an animal’s life.
firstaid,ff4fp02,t3_erkrh9,1579562500.0,"Looks like a cat scratched you. You can try some polysporin or any antibiotic cream which will help make sure it doesn’t get infected and may help with healing. 

Outside of that, not much you can do other than keep it clean. 

You could tell people you walked into a pole if the actual story is too embarrassing."
firstaid,fepv95l,t1_feprvvm,1579332531.0,"I assume protocols differ from around the world. Based on Canada, you are mostly right.

The only change I would suggest is that when the pt loses consciousness you probably won’t be able to realistically hold them up and do Heimlich (abdominal thrusts) with any realistic effectiveness. Think ragdoll. As such, training usually tells you to help the person gently to the ground (as you can) and begin cpr (to remove the obstruction) after you check the mouth for a loose obstruction. It is not an inspection but a quick check as the obstruction is likely near the epiglottis (too far to see). 

If there is an obstruction still in place when paramedics arrive they may attempt to physically remove it if it is visible but they are more likely to do an emergency tracheotomy.  If the pt has a clear airway they will intubate (as you describe) and treat as a cardiac arrest (no pulse) or respiratory arrest (pulse) 

The only other change is our training includes alternating back blows and abdominal thrusts (Heimlich). Another note is if the person is still able to cough or talk then they should be encouraged to cough as this is more effective than an intervention. If they can’t cough or speak then perform the heimlich."
britishcolumbia,fenc588,t3_eq21hh,1579281526.0,"I think education around expectations would be a good thing. It was clear that first responders were overwhelmed with calls. It’s a scary situation and spikes in call volume for an underfunded service will result in delays in response.

However, the call taker has to transfer you to the right first responder police/fire/ehs. It sounds like the call taker picked up right away but the transfer to fire took some time because they were dealing with other calls. 

To say “we need better 911 dispatch” based on one experience is ridiculous. They could have been dealing with a cardiac arrest, a multiple car accident, and 5 duplicate calls from the same scene.

Their job isn’t to control your emotions but to send the required emergency vehicle there as fast as possible. To do this they need to send you to the right agency as above and ask more questions which may seem irrelevant to the situation but help emergency services understand the situation and location.

In this case, they will also have to coordinate with the utility to shut off the power.  

For sure if you want to take this experience and lobby for an increase in dispatchers and call takers or talk to your provincial MLA I think that is a good move. My hope is your goal is to not just make a post on reddit but make some positive action towards change that you want to see."
wikipedia,fdsby44,t1_fdrxjtt,1578699093.0,"In this case the valve would be at the end of the tube so it would be a bit trickier but this person is right.

For first aid, if someone has a hole in their chest (stab, gunshot), the above method is used to create that one way valve. In pre-hospital care they make a thing called a chest seal which is basically a big sticker to seal the chest hole with a one way valve on it."
