FFVIIRemake,ff0eug1,t1_fezr3xk,1579468234.0,"You're grossly oversimplifying it. 

The Chrono Trigger comparison is a horrible one. You don't just pick what story you want to play from the main menu. You shape the story as you play the game. Having your in game choices influence the story deepens the experience. What you're suggesting does the opposite. 

Yes, I do think your idea is dumb. That's separate from the fact that it would require a lot of unnecessary work or ruin the quality of the final product. With this idea you're going to pidgeonhole every side quest and NPC in to only referencing the classic content.

I mean, really, if you're going to make the entire game world oblivious to any new additions then what is the point of adding anything new? If they rework quests and cutscenes to create a 'classic' experience then they're wasting millions to make the classic version. If they build the whole game around being 'classic' friendly then they're wasting millions developing the new content. 

Either way you cut it this would be a huge waste of resources to implement a half-baked and unsatisfying ending.

You can't please everyone, and that's all this idea of yours is trying to do. This remake isn't just for fans who played the original. In fact I'm pretty confident that hardcore fans who just want the exact same story with better graphics make up a very small minority of people interested in this game. Nearly half of gamers weren't even born when the original came out. 

So, by all means, you keep thinking that this idea wouldn't be a waste of resources to implement. Keep thinking that building the whole game around a classic mode wouldn't ruin any ability for the additions to have any meaningful impact on the world or story. Keep thinking that splitting the experience in two would please more people than it put off. I'm not going to waste any more of my own resources arguing with you."
FFVIIRemake,fewzkqz,t1_feuy1i2,1579421915.0,I'm not mad about you posting 'spoilers'. I'm frustrated by your obvious lack of understanding what it takes to make a game work. You just keep on believing its so simple.
FFVIIRemake,feu53f5,t1_feqq5xa,1579383195.0,"The PS5 is going to have modular downloads though, right? That change alone would make 500gb games possible. The high quality FMVs take up a massive chunk of the required space on a game like FF7 unless they're rendered in the engine in real time. They could package it similar to the discs in the original so you would only have to have a single 'disc' worth of content downloaded at any one point. A digital copy could even delete anything that wasn't being reused and automatically start downloading the next cutscenes and areas you'll come across."
FFVIIRemake,fetsxfl,t1_fetb34c,1579379688.0,"If you want to believe every leak you come across by all means do it, but you shouldn't preach them like facts to other people. 

You keep saying 'deviates from the original story' like anything that wasn't in the original automatically changes the story. The story is about an Ex-SOLDIER and his merry band of misfits getting together to stop an apocalyptic event started by a dude who was genetically altered using material from a space alien. 

Having whispers of fate and some fancy boy on a motorcycle don't change that story. Making the additions to the story take part exclusively in some weird alternate timeline that only serves the purpose of keeping Aerith around and cheapening Cloud overcoming his guilt and grief in the original. 

Not to mention this whole 'it's just a boolean switch super easy' attitude is hilariously misguided. Think about it, every side quest, character, location and bit of dialogue could not reference the new content in any way in case you were playing the 'classic' version. What are your options then? Rework entire scenes and environments is one. You could make all of the new content have no impact on the world at all, which is a ridiculous notion, is another. You could spend an ungodly amount of time and resources on meticulously going through the game and removing any line, scene, quest or NPC that mentions any of the new content... 

I can't think of a single way they could make it work without wasting tens of millions on on extra development that isn't even targeted at the majority of the audience. If there is a way, I don't know it, but I do know that developers can't just 'flip a switch' and turn one game in to two without ruining both of them in the process."

FFVIIRemake,feppk8t,t1_fepmr34,1579327051.0,"We've seen the whispers show up when Cloud and Aerith meet so they're definitely not exclusive to new content. Even if they were exclusive to new content just watch the inevitable FMV cut on YouTube. 

The 6 hour figure is based off of what you get out of the Midgar portion originally. If this 'classic cut' version were to exist, I'd expect it to at least stick to roughly the same time frame."
FFVIIRemake,fepkwxh,t1_fephmcp,1579323191.0,"If you want to play the old stuff it's still there. There isn't a sane person working on this game that would ever think this is a good idea.

They're turning the Midgar portion of the original game in to a full-sized RPG. What you're suggesting would take a  30 hour experience down to a 6. Not to mention the fact that 'just cutting out the scenes that are new' would never work. The whispers show up during key moments of the story, so they'd have to write and animate every scene involving them twice. They would literally have to spend millions of dollars creating something to offer people who only want to play 20% of the game. 

We already get Aerith for at least a full game, likely 2 cause I doubt they'll decide to kill her at the start of the next one. If 2 full games of playing as Aerith doesn't satisfy her stans then nothing will and it might be a better idea for them to just hack her in to the original.

I expect them to deepen the story, not fracture it in to two timelines."

I have had an insatiable Star Wars itch for the past couple months and just watched Rebels for the first time. This episode (season 2 finale for anyone curious) is the best episode of any Star Wars series and holds its own with the original trilogy in my opinion. I'm sure it's not nearly as impressive without everything that came before Rebels, but Ahsoka has always put up a good fight for my favorite Star Wars character, and this episode really did her and Vader justice."
