television,ffqxvvz,t1_ffqfr71,1580146107.0,I think it really has to do with the facts that our healthcare system is such a broken mess that people dont feel safe using our healthcare system. So they look for alternatives. Our whole system is based off of reactive care and not preventative care so a lot of people are looking for alternatives.
Chefit,ffny1gq,t3_euaz3g,1580072166.0,"I would try to get away from using a clock and time stuff out relative to the ticket and service, instead of apps out at 4:20 say apps in 10 min.
Soups 5min

Apps10min

Entre 20min

As you go down the ticket you cross things out and you automatically know how much time you have until the next course. This is a bit more flexible for service as well in case things go wrong or a table takes too long eating their course. That way you can just say add 5 min on this ticket to slow things down instead of saying, ok course 3 is now at 4:25. I wouldn't ever really refer to the actual time just how long somebody has to make it, you want to either have a large digital clock in view or everybody should have watches. If this is working well the only conversation in the pass will be how long and how soon. 

Are we ready for 4th course on table 20?

No chef! 5 more min please the guests aren't done with their mains!

If this is working really well it will just be food out the window real smooth no talk. Also be clear about what's getting fired and what isn't. Like if you say you're firing a ticket that should mean that you are say 50 minutes from all courses finished. 10 min every course roughly. Precise communication!"
