The book also explains why the T-1000 lays his hands on all of the papers and the computer in Dyson's home.  The field can be extended through contact to effectively read the papers and the files of the computer's hard drive.  A caveat to the T-1000 is that they were volunteers to skynet.  They had no control chip and could re-write their own programming at will and as such, could not be directly controlled by skynet.  At one point in the comics they actually revolted against skynet and sided with the humans for a time."

My tinctures are made with everclear (8-10) ghost peppers split but whole and put in a mason jar of everclear for about a month. The peppers should become bleached and faded.  you can leave the peppers in forever and eventually they go pure translucent white.  I use a 1ml medicine syringe and apply .5ml to bloody mary's and other drinks that require a hot kicker.  I store the dried peppers whole in large gallon mason jars, they'll keep for many years that way and you can just use a coffee grinder to powder some if you need it.  my 5 qt crockpot chili recipie uses a little of each and they are all good in small quantities for mixing in with dry meat rubs or as a general seasoning.  200 plants doesn;t yield as much as you think.  I go through most of my stock every year but it takes the whole year.  Rarely I'll make my boiler room ghost pepper sauce which is still only about half as hot as what this guy is downing.  I enjoy the heat, but I'm not suicidal."

Instantregret,fekuycr,t1_fekszz6,1579208129.0,"I grow outdoors in the summer.  I get used #7 nursery pots from the tree farm fairly cheap and grow 1 plant per pot.  usually around 200 plants total between the ghost, serrano, habanero, and whatever other species i'm experimenting with.  I make powders, chili spikers, and and concentrates from it all.  Unfortunately the soil is pretty sandy and fallow where I live so I have to use storebought potting soil.  It's a one-time expense as after the first season I can re-add miracle grow shake and feed and a little peat and sheep to get it back to good.  I start the seeds in february in my grow tent when I'm not growing pot during the winter and as soon as the weather breaks move them outside from the 1/4 quart starter pots direct to the big ones.  Make yourself a chicken wire sifter in a 2x4 frame so you can sift out the soil at the end of the year and get rid of the root mass without losing your soil.  Leave the small hairs for aeration.   Should be good for years."
