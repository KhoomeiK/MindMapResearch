It also keeps track of lists for you... You can just yell out “Alexa, add *xyz* to my shopping list (or Target list, or to-do list etc)”.  Then you can check the list on your phone (with the Alexa app) when you’re at the store.

therapy,ffpalz8,t3_eua6dg,1580090292.0,"I think of going to therapy like going to the gym. You’re doing a work out for your brain, your spirit, your emotions- and your therapist is like your personal trainer.  They can lead you through the exercises, but *you* have to do the real work to see results.  You don’t have to be horribly out of shape to get a personal trainer- there is always room to improve at whatever stage you’re at.  Some sessions will make you feel strong, and some will leave you feeling beaten up, but if you commit to the process and stay consistent- you will see results as you grow more healthy"
