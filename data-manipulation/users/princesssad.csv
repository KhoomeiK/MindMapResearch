BPD,feivhvv,t3_ep8rv9,1579148333.0,sometimes i get really angry about the way i look and it makes me want to shave all my hair off but i know how much i would regret it so i just end up pulling on my hair to get the rage out.
TheCircleTV,feiv2r5,t1_feimcdb,1579148002.0,yeah i noticed that but in an interview article joey said that miranda came to his apartment a couple times after the show and they talk all the time. it sounded like he said he’s in a relationship with her but doesn’t want to make it official so people can think what they want.

depression,fei4ic6,t3_ep56vp,1579130100.0,"depression can happen to anyone even if they are beautiful, healthy, or super rich. sometimes my depression happens because of a trigger but a lot of the time it comes out of no where. depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain that makes you lose motivation and makes it hard to enjoy things."
BodyDysmorphia,fei45xd,t3_ep4txi,1579129886.0,"i used to think i had pretty feet, as long as i was wearing nail polish. but then as i get older i was like my feet are super thick and my toes are stubby. also they are kind of hairy so i have to shave them a lot. then i got a mosquito bite in the middle of my left foot and i scratched/picked it so much it left a big brown circle scar. i’m alwaysss wearing socks."
BodyDysmorphia,fei3pzz,t3_ep6bz6,1579129605.0,i was telling my therapist how i feel ugly all the time and she said “maybe it’s because you don’t wear enough makeup” and she told me to look up makeup tutorials and said that i looked really tired because of my dark circles so i should wear concealer. she also said i should wear foundation so my skin tone looks more even. lastly she said i should wear a lot of eyeshadow and eyeliner to make my eyes look smaller. i left in tears and told my parents and they said she was just trying to be “helpful.” anyway i stopped seeing her and i think i made the best decision.
