Well try to change your style,change your haircut,buy new clothes except constantly remind yourself that you’re doing this for yourself not for someone else,well at least more for yourself than for someone else."

selfimprovement,ffsroed,t1_ffsnw1p,1580190030.0,Keep your head up!Career and future is really stressing gotta agree but honestly the only thing we can really do for ourselves is focus on the present moment.
selfimprovement,ffsdr77,t1_ffsbxbd,1580179259.0,"The first and most important thing i could say is that have to be aware of them and aware of the fact that most of the time you always accept them so it cause you trouble.(Dont know if what I’m saying is making any sense)

Second thing you have to question these thoughts 

« Will this matter in the future? »

« Am i making myself happy by thinking about this? »

« Does it matter right now? »

And even if you think you’re right about that negative thought  for exemple 

« I suck »

Rather than focusing on how bad you are at that thing you can focus on the solution and how you can improve on the situation instead of putting so much focus on the problem itself.

And of course you’ll always have these negative thoughts in your life but the more you fight/ignore them  the more you’ll get stronger mentally.I guess you could see it this way."
