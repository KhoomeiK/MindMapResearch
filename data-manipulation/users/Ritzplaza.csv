cycling,fedrtg4,t3_eomyhk,1579018523.0,"Flip I’ve locked my bike in both of those areas of Cardiff. Only for ten minutes or so, but I’d be devastated if it got pinched. Not doing that again! Thanks for the heads up"
Zwift,fe7j5sp,t1_fe6tdlb,1578915275.0,"It should do, it’s got the right ram and memory requirements plus running android 8.0. Bit too pricey for me at £230. Thank you all the same it’s all helping me come to decision on whether to buy now or hang on for the price to drop a bit"
Zwift,fe3n39c,t1_fe3hez7,1578850822.0,Aye I would do that but unfortunately I use it at the gym where I can’t cast you a bigger screen. Thanks all the same though
Zwift,fe3mv84,t1_fe3e5ed,1578850775.0,Might consider it. I’ve heard the old one’s weren’t powerful enough but the 10 does have 2gb ram which is the minimum requirement for Zwift. Thanks for your help
Zwift,fe33ukd,t1_fe2sed9,1578845640.0,Well it’s another avenue to explore so thank you!
Zwift,fe29925,t1_fe1u6qh,1578835879.0,Thanks for that looks like a decent purchase
Zwift,fe26tro,t1_fe1t38c,1578835080.0,"Thanks yeah I did see those. The tablets in recommended section are a bit out of my price range. Really just looking for first hand experience from people, but thank you for the input."
Zwift,fe1o70v,t1_fe1jvky,1578828955.0,Aye it does but the screen is incredibly small and I can’t make out what’s going on really. It’s an iPhone SE and if I can afford it would ideally want to upgrade to a small tablet
Zwift,fe1347e,t1_fasxftk,1578821937.0,Hi sorry for random after the event question. Can I ask what android tablet you’re using? Looking to get one for the same purpose down the gym etc.
cycling,fdx50ge,t1_fdw5u7h,1578765423.0,"I’ve got the triban 520 not the RC. And I can vouch for it had it nearly a year and I’ve done 2,000 miles ish never missed a beat. Had to change out the wheels but that’s standard."
bicycling,fdwpqxc,t1_fdw0fro,1578761197.0,Sure maybe so. But looking in the mirror is sufficient in my experience. Unless you are in the back seat then obviously not.
classicalmusic,fduf69o,t1_fdqx6dt,1578732208.0,"I guess at some point they get bored, and just want to show off their talent for really complex pieces."
AskUK,fdsa9f6,t1_fds90fu,1578697958.0,"Ok you sound super happy. Just when you hit that wall remember there’s help out there. You don’t have to keep being this angry.  There’s an organisation called mind that really help with things like this. Best of luck mate, top four university is amazing not trying to patronising sorry if I was. I just empathised with that anger, and I’m glad I could get beyond that I hope you can as well you deserve it."
AskUK,fds8iqh,t1_fds734p,1578696775.0,"Jesus mate, you need to contact some therapy related nhs outlet now. Eating junk food all day is not healthy, not doing exercise is not healthy. Thinking like this is not healthy, get yourself some medicine as soon as you can. You don’t deserve to give away your short life to this, get help please friend"
bicycling,fds6qjl,t1_fdr2ykn,1578695605.0,"Totally accept your point and yes I guess I have always conditioned myself to look. But no more so than you condition yourself to look when crossing a road say. Passengers, yes this would totally be useful. I would opt personally for the open the door slightly and then look as well. I try to do this although admittedly not every time"
cycling,fdqq8vw,t1_fdqq3ma,1578672548.0,I think is the tyre going to go and they’re in decent condition. The idea of coming off the bike at 40mph+... absolutely terrifying!
bicycling,fdqiqyn,t1_fdqi80x,1578667674.0,Car doors function best when attached to the vehicle I find
bicycling,fdqiol5,t1_fdqiebk,1578667627.0,"Incredibly so. The van stopped and people rushed over to check she was ok. Just one of those times where she and everyone were like well that wasn’t very clever. I just don’t get people who don’t look, it’s literally a case of glancing your eyes at the mirror. Not a massive ask imo"
bicycling,fdqhz8g,t1_fdqgaal,1578667136.0,"I remember seeing this happen as kid. Woman opened door as van drove past at speed, bent the door right back nearly took it off the hinges. Woman covered in glass and cuts, lucky to not lose an arm. Always checked since then. As a cyclist I always expect something like this to happen, stay frosty out there"
bicycling,fdqfjxv,t1_fdqc17r,1578665387.0,I have no idea what the hate for wing mirrors is. But yeah look at it before opening the door. Literally been doing that since I was a teenager?!?
bicycling,fdqfdzc,t3_emr4ei,1578665260.0,This is grandpa joe level effort right here
cycling,fdqcqsl,t3_emqw5g,1578663159.0,There’s no way you want to be coming down a hill at speed thinking is now when that tyre goes. Change ASAP
bicycling,fdqbj1f,t3_emqhh3,1578662113.0,I’m sure lots of people could benefit from that. I just take a glance in the wing mirror. Handy for the back seats though

britishproblems,fdpwptj,t1_fdobt6d,1578643686.0,"After having to watch it with the wife, and against my will enjoying it, at least the first time I watched it. It’s like junk food, fine every so often but you really shouldn’t live on that stuff."
britishproblems,fdpwin1,t1_fdntzya,1578643437.0,"Predicament. Wife loves watching love island, that’s fine I’ll go next door and watch something else. Oh no after a few days complaints ring out of you’re not spending time with me. Fine I’ll sit in the room and watch something on my laptop with some headphones. No compadre, now you can’t hear her make comments on what’s happening. And then if I say something like ‘I really don’t give a shit what Candice just said’ oh now I’m being grumpy. Then I’m watching and I know what’s going on, and then I start to care about the outcome of such and such cliff hanger. It’s like the sandpit monster from return of the Jedi, you fall in on the side and then are slowly digested for three months or however long that tripe is on."
britishproblems,fdp07lb,t1_fdnuisk,1578616903.0,Not really fair on the island

cycling,fdgjmlm,t1_fdgjdlp,1578399455.0,Oh dear that does sound a bit more severe. I hope someone offer you some help. I might suggest posture and position on the bike? I know myself from some small adjustments helped should pain I was having. Might be a trial and error sort of thing where you try different things
cycling,fdgj5hq,t3_elakv7,1578398945.0,Can’t say for shocks or suspension. Buy on long rides on my road bike along poor quality roads I’ll get a numbness in my hands. I’ve been told double bar tape or good padded cycling gloves can help. You might try that. Or could be a combination with just getting back into riding.

cats,fcxxews,t1_fcxvzl3,1578071799.0,"The base camp idea certainly sounds like good advice. I’ve basically set her up in a back room with a comfy covered bed that she can sent mark. And we’ll just leave her to it for a while and let her get to know the place. Our last kitten was wondering everywhere on the first day, so we’re just getting used to her being a bit more timid which is absolutely fine. She’s had a tough start"
cats,fcxjwtk,t1_fcxj5lq,1578064748.0,Ok I’ll try that. I did set her up in the pantry but ran out and hid in the shoes. I’m just worried she’ll get stuck somewhere. I’ve tried to seal up any small dangerous spaces. She’s currently hiding in a box of scarves and seems pretty content. Leaving her be for a couple days sounds like good advice I’ll see if I can coax her back to the pantry
