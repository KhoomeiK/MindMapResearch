Also, it is August so it is horribly hot and humid and any movement is unbearable. OR it’s February and it’s freezing so everyone is in big coats making movement all but impossible.

interestingasfuck,fe8giqe,t3_enw2lt,1578925900.0,Wow. Why did I get down voted for commenting â€œMicrocosmic Godâ€? This is the science fiction short story written by Theodore Sturgeon that this Simpsonâ€™s plot line is an homage to. I guess Reddit really is 12 1/2.  I remember a Reddit where that was a known reference.

politics,fe5fnte,t3_enpcm6,1578868890.0,"In all fairness he never understood what Congress does anyway. He hasnâ€™t the faintest inkling how government works, how people â€”most espesh his constituentsâ€”live, the price of bread; Iâ€™ll bet heâ€™s never had to use a public restroom. For him and his inherited wealth ignorance is truly 9/10ths of the law. 

He is not a fully functioning human being and probably never has been.  If we are all lucky he will die in his sleep very very soon. God knows itâ€™s the only reason Melania still goes to church."

btw-not for nothing I think the new term is either developmentally disabled or neurodiverse, if you want. If not, no biggie. js."

DeadBedrooms,fe3018f,t1_fe2vn7c,1578844660.0,"Thank you for this. I agree OPâ€™s experience was lousy but an eight year relationship solely for sperm seems to sell short the beginning of their relationship as described by OP. 

For commenters to believe that she was nothing more than a sperm succubus at the expense of both OP and their children is kind of a push. The angry comments are cringeworthy.

Also, did you notice the user name? Anyway..."
RoverPetSitting,fdyrzpr,t3_ekgtcr,1578782972.0,"A very important consideration for OP and commenters, geographical context is everything. NYC, SF, Seattle, and maybe Chicago are all cities having very high costs of living.  If tipping is culturally common than tip.  In the last decade I have lived in all of these cities and tipping is par for the course. I now live in St. Louis and it is not all that common."
