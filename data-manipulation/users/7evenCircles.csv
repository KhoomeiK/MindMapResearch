Also when I was in 4th grade I wanted to look up Neil Young's band Crazy Horse, so I just typed in crazyhorse.com. It is a chain of strip clubs."

politics,ffhlppz,t1_ffh1e7p,1579941226.0,"Am I missing something? My family watches Fox News 3 hours per day. There is nothing here that will sway the Republicans. ""They've been after him since day 1!"" so anything the Democratic establishment does is just fruit of the poisonous tree, and all criticism is fake news because they're sore losers, in their eyes."

I'm socially and economically liberal, I've never voted Republican and very likely never will, but I do not understand at all the collective pearl clutching about Jordan Peterson. He broadly thinks you find meaning in the people around you and that Marxism is bad. He wrote a self-help book that basically says ""get a job and stop making excuses for yourself."" He said that if you consistently fail with women, the problem isn't women, it's you. He called the MGTOW crowd a bunch of losers. Radical. All these ancillary complaints about him thinking that racial privilege isn't the superlative type of privilege or that traditional family structure has value because of its intercultural persistence just feels ticky tacky -- this is a subjective domain and he operates from a rational base so that even if you disagree with his opinion, you can understand why he thinks it. The worst part about him is the huge influx of right wing zealots that follow him now that he's gone mainstream just because he opposes aspects of progressivism and mindlessly parroting some soundbite of him makes them feel smart and now you can't watch a video of his on YouTube without the algorithm recommending you ""fIVe TiMeES joRdAN pEterSoN oWnED pUsSy LibS wItH faCtS aND LOgiC."" Prime example is his own sub, which was actually pretty fucking thoughtful for an internet message board a couple years ago, now it's just ""lol dae think libs are retarded"" memes. A lot of the best posters left because the mods wouldn't enforce a sufficient content policy and I had to unsubscribe like a year or two ago. Damn shame. Anyways. I didn't mean to type this much. Sorry."

aww,ffhb7xc,t1_ffft4n7,1579928595.0,">i have not spoken to bitchy sister in 5 years since she hung up on me mid call because I was crying and dealing with a terrible crisis with my daughter. But no, hang up.mid call and never call me back.

Holy shit lol, I haven't talked to my sister since last year for pretty much the same reason. Family crisis, my brother told me he hated me and nobody on the planet can even tolerate me, I called up my sister crying, I told her I liked her and asked if she liked me. She paused for 3 seconds and said ""sure."" Hung up right there. Haven't had any contact with her since."
AskReddit,ffhayry,t1_ffgxrlh,1579928357.0,"Yeah, I don't blame women for it at all. You sound like a good person, and I admire your character. Be well."
AskReddit,ffhamsw,t1_ffgzmpc,1579928044.0,"I'm not sure exactly what you mean by ""the only compliments you are looking for are from people you are sexually attracted to."" As in, only women as a group, or only specifically *attractive* women? 


I think a lot of women underestimate how much of an impact they have on men, as a group. A lot of men crave feminine approval at a very deep level, whether they will admit it or not. You see that drive manifested in reality as what can inspire both masculine sacrifice and intersexual homicide, incel anger, etc. It's not something that will be replaced anytime soon.


I just wish we could just be generally friendlier and more respectful and understanding to and of each other. That would be a nice thing."
AskReddit,ffh9701,t1_ffh77tq,1579926742.0,"For the most part, I don't have to worry about things that women have to worry about like someone trying to spike my drink, walking by myself, traveling alone abroad, stalkers, harassment, what I'm projecting by my dress, etc. At the same time, people generally do not give a shit about me outside of what I can provide them. People don't offer to do things for me just because. People don't offer to help me when I'm visibly struggling -- I broke my foot once at a park, had to hobble and hop a mile and a half back to my car, passed by a bunch of people, and no one even looked me in the eye. I don't get approached by strangers. I don't get complimented. Online dating sucks. It's a lot like being invisible. It's great and it fucking sucks, simultaneously."

AskReddit,ffgv1b3,t1_ffgjvuf,1579915775.0,"The average man receives so little positive attention from women outside his family that he assumes you have to be complimenting him for a reason. He reacts inappropriately, and you become less likely to compliment someone in the future. It creates a positive feedback loop and it's not really anyone's fault. 


I've actually started talking about this with my dude friends and it's kind of insane, we all remember exactly the last time a woman complimented us. Last May a middle aged lady said I have a really nice, soft voice. I told everyone I know. It would be funny if it weren't kind of pathetic, lol."

aww,fffsneh,t1_ffetqc1,1579890929.0,"I have two very spiteful and malicious siblings. My older sister has BPD and gets extremely uncomfortable with any kind of physical contact. My younger brother is just generally cruel and mean-spirited, serial cheater, the type of person who will have friends over, carry on with them, and then immediately shit talk them when they leave. Meanwhile I'm very huggy and sappy and sentimental. My entire life I've wanted a more ""typical"" younger sister, someone I could actually love on and have a friendly relationship with, though I feel bad for thinking it. 


I talk to them about twice a year. It's very lonely, and this gif tore my heart out. This is really just a long-winded way of saying we can be rich in so many more ways than one."
