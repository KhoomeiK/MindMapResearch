fatlogic,ffg7yq7,t3_etg8n6,1579900414.0,"As a guy that has struggled with restrictive eating disorders in the past, it was never about comparing myself to models/others, it was simply me being (irrationally) upset with my body and looks due to other underlying issues. Convincing myself if I looked a certain way I'd suddenly be cured of all my issues and unhappiness.

Considering guys/men aren't bombarded by unrealistic goals nearly as much as girls/women, honestly the issue was mine and mine alone. Obviously everyone wants to feel good about themselves, but it's ridiculous and offensive to say eating disorders *always* stem from unrealistic expectations due to the media or weight stigma or whatever.

I'm not really sure if my story even qualifies compared to what some people have been through, but that's just my thoughts and experience on the matter."
fatlogic,ffg6dug,t1_ffg5vcw,1579899433.0,"Absolutely agree.

The only issue is they claim higher weights (such as obesity) don't cause any health issues - maybe just further denial?

I honestly feel bad, binge eating is a serious ED too."
fatlogic,fffwomh,t3_etekwf,1579893446.0,"How can you blame the diet for your weight gain? 

If dieting caused you to lose weight (which they admit), then sticking to it would eventually lead to simple maintenance, certainly not weight gain.

I guess admitting that it's a lifestyle change and not a temporary one is too much for them. They think once they hit that magic number they can eat whatever they want and not gain, even though it's *the reason they gained in the first place*."

fatlogic,ffe1hxo,t3_et3f6y,1579834259.0,"It really doesn't take an incredible amount of energy or time, just gotta have patience.

These people treat dieting and weight loss like it's all or nothing, and expect instant results.

Even just a deficit of 200 calories will have you losing weight. Replace that soda with water, for example. You don't have to starve yourself, not even remotely.

It's also a *lifestyle* change, not just a temporary one. Of course you'll gain the weight back if you *eat the way that made you gain weight in the first place*. Not because your body has a ""set point""."

fatlogic,ffadz70,t1_ff4mag6,1579733349.0,"Water weight, dehydration, time of day (when you first wake up vs after a big meal), etc can all effect your weight day to day. Don't get too fixated on the *exact* number from day to day. To gain a pound overnight you'd need to eat 3,500 over your TDEE. That's a lot.

I personally find I have a range of +-5 pounds on any given day (some days 178 others 182), but it's constant over the weeks with an average of 180.

I would recommend weighing yourself at the same time of day and under similar conditions if possible.

Don't get too fixated on the number on any *individual day*, instead follow the trend. If you find after a week or two the number keeps going up (on average), you know you are gaining. If it stays relatively the same, you're maintaining. If it goes down, you're losing weight. But I'm talking at least 1-2 weeks *minimum*, for you in particular.

Honestly maybe measuring yourself once a week or however often you want might be better. If your waist is getting smaller but the scale doesn't move (as you've stated), you are absolutely losing fat. 

If the measurements are going down then great! You're on the right track. If the scale is going down over the weeks, that's great too! You know your body best. Before and after photos once a week can help you see progress too.

Feel free to ask any more questions! Good luck on your weight loss journey:)

And of course, don't forget to take everything you hear on here with a grain of salt, including what I have to say. I'm sure there are those that will disagree with me and that's fine. Ultimately it's what works best for you and your body. You know best, and *you got this*. :)"

kratom,fepixhr,t3_eqa6tt,1579321682.0,"It can, temporarily at least in my experience (red strains especially), but in the long run being entirely dependant on only Kratom to cope isn't healthy; it'll only suppress your feelings instead of letting you process them and move on.

Honestly, I lost my mother two years ago and every day is still a struggle, but it does get easier with time. Let yourself feel. I won't lie, you'll have some good days and some God awful days, but you gotta keep pushing forward. It WILL get better over time.
