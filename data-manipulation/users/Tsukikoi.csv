likeus,ffgz5zq,t1_fffle9e,1579918828.0,"I can't understand it either! At the rehabilitation center the pigeons were absolutely the sweetest. They just wanted to hop in your lap for a bit of cuddles while you cleaned their cage up. When you opened the cage they'd try to get out with all of their being, only to be perfectly calm once on a lap. 

Though, maybe the people on incubators were cuddling them more than they should have. Ideally we wanted the birbs to not love humans so... Perhaps a bit of a fail. I was also at fault for this as it's just easier to feed a pigeon on your lap sometimes. Also they're incredibly soft...

More of a major no-no was talking too much around the crows since they couldn't be released if they started speaking. They were worried about a talking crow scaring someone and then the crow getting harmed because of it."
