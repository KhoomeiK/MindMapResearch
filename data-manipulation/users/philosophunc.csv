AskReddit,ffq5h10,t1_ffq55n1,1580121565.0,You know scoring low on neuroticism means you score high on character disorder right?

Bad news is, you dont need to be fit for a large percentage of jobs. One could argue their is no time. Sure time affects the ability to exercise. But does not significantly affect the ability to eat healthy. There are far more caveats to the issue. But a very stemming point is education. People rarely eat garbage when they truly face the fact that garbage will kill you. Unfortunately being able to identify what is garbage or not is also socially inherited. Everyone else eats McDonald's and kfc. So it cant be that bad can it?"

WatchPeopleDieInside,ff8kejb,t1_fbwbgr0,1579682688.0,What people tend to forget is playing favourites fucks up everyone. The one that's left out and definately the one who is the favourite. Society already does it's best to make us question our inherit self worth (how hard is it for some to be happy with themselves?) It does it's best to promote inequities. In a safe place like within a family circle everyone should be inheritely and equally valued. Simply for being 1 of the members of the family. A family is a unit not a hierarchy of who's more or less valuable.
