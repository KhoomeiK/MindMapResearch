leagueoflegends,fe858nb,t1_fe7xjbd,1578922727.0,"You are again miss understanding I am not telling people not to go to doctors I have theropy and have medication if you were to look at the discord you would see help lines discussion on medication and support with side effects you seem to think I am trying to replace medical help what I am doing is creating a community for those that don't feel comfortable in other because of their problems you.

On my server you will find contacts for emergency help or how to set cbt counciling without having to go to a Dr and being able to do it over the phone instead of in public so before speaking up please look at what I am doing before commenting"

leagueoflegends,fe6siv8,t1_fe6s6io,1578903345.0,I don't think you understand anxiety depression or the reason for this post I am not here to tell people what to do I suffer with depression and anxiety I have been in that place where I am not comfortable to go out and spend time with people but will sit behind my pc watching films playing games and would love to talk to others to socialize with people but in my comfort zone and I know I am not the only one I have seen people be part of massive discord communities where they have been active and as soon as they mention their health they have been ignored for chat they have been shunned until they leave the community I am not trying to be a Dr I am trying to show that there are people in the same situation and understand I have been through theropy I am medicated intact if you were to check the server you would see there is contacts for health support and who to contact in time of crisis so thank you for your input but I don't think you understand what I am trying to do
