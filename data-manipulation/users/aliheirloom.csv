depression,ff8ce3s,t3_es3msr,1579672790.0,"I know the feeling.. My song during my attempt (well, one of my attempts) was Battle scars by lupe fiasco. I heard it recently after having forgotten it for a while."
AskReddit,ff8buu5,t1_ff6zp9n,1579672244.0,"Lmao reminds me of when I got blackout drunk at a friend's house and got ""stuck"" in their bathroom for hours. 

I guess I turned the light off by accident and couldn't get it back on or figure out the door lol"

depression,femamgm,t1_fema9b9,1579246160.0,I really wish so too. Thank you.
depression,fema0jl,t3_eprzer,1579245388.0,"I feel exactly the same. I don't see myself ever being able to have and maintain such a lifestyle. I'm simply not capable.

Every time I think about leading a normal life I groan internally. I don't fucking want to shower and do laundry and go to work and cook meals. Too much bullshit. I'd rather just rot into the dirt."
offmychest,fem73p3,t3_epndfj,1579242115.0,This rings sooo true for me. I might post it to my fb wall as one last cry.
confession,fejidw6,t1_fejd0yb,1579175592.0,And he's from India himself and is just a teen.. Kinda sad honestly
AskReddit,feifigl,t3_ep7tm4,1579137321.0,"Basically any song by Being as an Ocean (except their newest album, which is generic garbage. Not trying to be mean but damn it sucks)

Also Deathbeds by BMTH. This song has a special place in my heart. Not in a good or happy way, but obviously there's nothing good or happy about my life since I'm depressed"
me_irl,fd7nusc,t3_ek6ynu,1578207352.0,That's actually profound
unpopularopinion,fc762um,t3_egewxk,1577498526.0,This is definitely a popular opinion. Nobody on my fb timeline will shut up about it
