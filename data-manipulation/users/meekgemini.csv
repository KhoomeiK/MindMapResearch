CRedit,feieq87,t1_feid6x5,1579136793.0,"I want to first say I’m not a credit specialist. 

I will give you the advice I gave my best friend who also had a low score and wanted a boost. 

My best friend is a college student so I told him to apply for the Capital One Journey card. It’s good for students and has decent cash back. It’s not a student specific card so you can apply. I feel like capital one is an easy bank to get an approval. And with your current score you should qualify for a nice credit line. 

I never recommend closing an account because that *could* impact your credit history timeframe. I’d say keep it *if* you need it and pay it off in full to avoid interest. 

If you get a credit card, I advised my friend to use it for day to day purchases. He made it his “I’m driving an hour to and from college every single day” card and paid it off monthly. 

I use my capital one credit card for my subscriptions like my Disney+, gym membership, printing subscription, and a few other things. I get cash back for $40 being charged each month which if I saved enough cash back rewards I could almost have a “free month” 

That’s my suggestion. I feel like I’m forgetting something, but feel free to DM anytime with questions."

I’ll never understand the people who read their card numbers off in series of 3’s. It literally has 4 space 4 space 4 space 4. Why are you reading it in 3s? 

But I definitely believe context as to what the number is matters. 
Read your 16 digit card number off in 4s, your 9 digit routing numbers in 3s, your phone number normal 111-111-1111, and don’t start reading single digits when giving me a long number and throw a “4 thousand” or “4 zeros” in the middle cause it *can* cause miscommunication, confusion, and frustration for the customer and agent. 

But I’m definitely more picky about it because I’ve always been a number nerd whose loved number sequences and I follow patterns. 

Most account numbers are 10 digits for a checking account so I’ll read it as 012-345-6789 because the 6789 is the last 4 and someone could easily register “yes that’s the last 4”"

I have a substance abuse problem, and I tried time and time again to sober up, but kept going back when I’d have withdrawals. 
One day I woke up from a haze and it’s like something clicked on inside my brain that said “goodness girl what are you doing?!” And I haven’t looked back. Withdrawals were the worst, I went three or four months of symptoms. 
I think in a way you have an advantage. 
You know you have a problem, you want to get sober, AND you have a support system. 
Trying to sober up when you’re not working is honestly the best thing you could do. 
I sobered up in a psychiatric care facility, where they had activities for me to do. 
Once I was released from the facility I was terrified of relapsing, but I was able to use that time and money on pills and in hazy naps on hobbies. I travel, read, write, draw, I am a photographer on the side. 
I’ve filled the gaps with something meaningful. 
In regards to the symptoms, they’re gonna be hard. 
I combat them by drinking a bunch of water/Gatorade and going to the gym a lot. I also listened to the symptoms, so if I had hot flashes, I didn’t hesitate to strip down and lay on ice packs.

You have a mortgage, so you have a home. 
To get good loan terms for any type of home improvement does require a good FICO score. 
You never think something will go wrong until it does. 
I specialize in home improvement loans and the clients I speak with always go on about how they never thought their roof would get damaged in storms and insurance not cover everything and suddenly they need a loan for $5,000 or their HVAC goes out and that’s $9,000. 
In a home that you own, you’re usually on the line unless your homeowners insurance covers it. 
I pray you don’t run into any home issues that require financing, but keep in mind that anything could happen. 
I understand wanting to step away from US bank (I’m trying to do the same exact thing) 
I’m unfamiliar with secured credits cards, if it’s the kind of card that closes after inactivity, I would just let it sit idle and wait until it closes (typically two years) that way you have that account, that timeframe without negatively impacting your score. You don’t have to use it.

I help as much and as often as I can, but it’s not enough. It’s gotten to the point that all of her cards are maxed and she can’t afford to feed the kids. My sibling up and left without granting my mother custody so she doesn’t qualify for any assistance in that sense and can not afford a lawyer to assist with custody.

If you apply on your own and let’s say only get a $8k limit on a card, you could have him apply for a secondary line of credit to make the difference but keep in mind that balance transfers have fees associated so if you got an 8k line, and the total you need is 11k, your SO getting a 3k loan wouldn’t fully cover it due to the fees. Some banks I’ve seen have balance transfer fees of 5% of the total amount. 
When I personally did a balance transfer on an 8k balance, I think I paid roughly $200 for the fee."
