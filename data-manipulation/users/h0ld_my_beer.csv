If it happens to earn me a raise, that’s great too. But I believe I can earn that increase through my own hard work and proof of skill."
offmychest,ffh0duw,t1_ffh046y,1579919743.0,"The number of people I have worked with who have somehow achieved a master’s degree (or in many cases a bachelor’s degree), but have no business wearing the credentials that come with it, is staggering. Academia used to be something really great. Ironically, I think the programs that get made fun of most (the arts, literature, theology) are probably the most rigorous now.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure the Ivys are still kicking the shit out of their students to earn that degree. But I agree that the standard for higher education has been lowered to accommodate people who don’t need degrees to function in society in the first place."
offmychest,ffh0256,t1_ffgzsue,1579919498.0,"Hang in there! I’ve been pursuing my undergrad degree since I was 18. It’s a long, harrowing road for a lot of us. Put your efforts where YOU know they’ll pay off, and remember that despite what society tells you, there are people like me and the guy who hired me making decisions about whether to hire you. Don’t let the sheeple get you down. Show them what you know, and trudge forward."

todayilearned,fcw49hl,t3_ej0umo,1578016799.0,"I live in the area where this happened and remember it like it was yesterday. I was in high school, and one of my teachers grew up in a neighboring community. It was really awful. I still (though very rarely) drive past that school, and think of those kids. 

Living and interacting with the Amish and Mennonite communities as frequently as we do here leads to a jaded outlook on their lifestyle, but they are the kindest and most peaceful people. They really just want to preserve their customs and beliefs. Nobody deserves to experience what they did. Observing an attack on a community of children who are completely without defense or any form of recourse was a nauseatingly formative moment for me. It was the first time I recall children so young being shot like this, and it really stuck with me.

The Amish embraced the murderer’s family in a way I could never have anticipated, and I have never witnessed a more beautiful act of forgiveness."
