There is no official starting or ending point for decades, as its sole defintion is any 10 year period. There are two methods of counting decades in recognition. One counts decades starting with the first year 1 CE (For example, the years 1981-1990 is referred to as the 199th decade), while the other groups years based on having the same digits (For example, the years 1980-1989 is referred to as the 1980s, or commonly known as the eighties).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade)"
