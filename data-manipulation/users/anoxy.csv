Please, for the love of god re-read my message. Why are you incapable of not thinking in absolutes? I said: 

>***most often*** those are based in the cities or in very close proximity to them

Nobody said 5-10 cities. I'm referring to larger city areas in general. Hopefully it doesn't come as a shock to you that jobs, gyms, supermarkets, public transportation, nightlife, quality apartment (rental) housing, etc. are concentrated around city areas. Great for you if you're happy living out in the burbs where attending social events is a road trip, or driving to work is 20 chapters of an audiobook. Not everyone wants that, and you trying to paint that as unreasonable is hilariously out of touch. 

There's a reason we have programs like teach for america where you can get your student loans forgiven by working in underprivileged areas. Because nobody wants to live there. Location is extremely important to most people, both intrinsically and extrinsically"
