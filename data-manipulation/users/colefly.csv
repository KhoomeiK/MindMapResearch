I'm taking about the shit franchises that engender tiny manager kingdoms and corporate culture.

And it's not universal for each resterant. It's based on specific areas.

Like the KFC near my local college town is fine. The one in the city sells grease soup with chicken bits and rat turds. 

Applebee's, MC'D, Subway, and even many Chinese Food places are like this.

My local MCDs manager would would stir  and unclog the milkshake goo in the tank with their bare hairy forearm

Places that engender so many barely hidden rats and roaches that sick employees aren't the biggest problem




You just blanket support of shitty and dangerous practices that you haven't bothered to worry about is irresponsible and unfair. You entitled ass

So fuck you for immediately blanket shitting on everyone who was ever fired from a shitty job. I'm sure it's fun looking down your nose at entire classes of people, but just know you've grown up to be that asshole that a younger you probably, hopefully, despised

Put those together, and it sounds as if you have contempt for those too poor to quarantine for weeks.


That may not be what you intended. But that's how it reads.

I must take time from my hobbies that use my extra income to chastise these cretins for not putting their livelihoods on the line by abandoning their workplaces for two weeks.

Surely, they simply can walk away for weeks at the sign of a cough. Just save their, I don't know, sport betting money? or video game money? I'm sure the mall kiosk they work at will allow them to step away for that long"
