In the formats that Narset is most relevant in, it's just *always* ""easier"" there. In legacy, if you're going to interact with something, you're probably bringing 1 or 0 cmc ways to do that. A 2cmc answer generally needs to have some sort of *upside*. StP/Bolt for creatures. Force of vigor is just the latest in a long and noble tradition of ""card disadvantage to kill an artifact for free"" effects, even though they're usually red. And enchantments barely matter in the format but there are efficient ways to kill them if it matters. 

They didn't start printing planeswalkers until they *stopped* printing most good removal, so they never printed a cheap enough planeswalker removal spell to balance the card type. So you are mostly limited to fighting them on the stack, attacking them and just eating the card disadvantage and tempo loss, or just letting them sit there forever. 

What we need is something that's just like ""U, destroy target planeswalker or counter target planeswalker spell"" or something like that. ""Planewalkerblast"" instead of redblast."

But what these UFOs are described as doing is not any number of ""generations"" removed from current aircraft performance. In order to make such a thing you'd need to imagine that the government had made huge breakthroughs in *fundamental physics* in secret, with no connection to the rest of the academic community. That's a much harder conspiracy to sell me on, for a lot of reasons."

And, when they built them, they built one first, to test it, and then *two*. We used 100% of the nukes in the world on Japan. They couldn't have taken over everything. For so many reasons, not least of which because they didn't have a bomber to carry the weapons."

news,fehtp2i,t1_fef1ysv,1579123666.0,"It's really no more plausible that the tech was created *now* than that it was created in the 60s anyway. What's being described is just absurd. You'd have to believe that the government somehow has teams of researchers who've made huge breakthroughs in *fundamental physics* with absolutely no connection to the regular academic community. Not like how the NSA swallows up some mathematicians--it'd have to be training them from the ground up. A whole ""secret MIT"". That's just totally implausible."

The answer to that question is that ""she sells sea shells by the sea shore"" is a famous tongue twister. The AI is using that phrase to test its speech and the joke is riffing on the same reference. They aren't referencing each other and it's not really a coincidence--there's just a well known thing that you missed until now."
