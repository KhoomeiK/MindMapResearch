Drugs,ffdhwkr,t1_ez8ws82,1579821218.0,"I'm really glad bis hypothesis of her reaction turned out to be true because of the fact that drugs can absolutely have the wrong effect on someone. I've never had a bad trip but I've been put in a bad mood while tripping which caused mild paranoia. I needed sober friends to ground me a little bit for comfort while I road the rest of the trip out. If she's dealt with that kind of mental and emotional instability,  coupled with her experiences in life,  things could've easily gone way wrong. Never ever assume that drugs will effect everyone the same way."

However, when the roll hit super hard initially, I had this feeling like my throat wanted to close up for about 10 minutes and i felt mild panic and had to lie down. Marijuana does that to me.

My one time on molly seems to have bits and pieces of all the drugs I've done. The worst being the marijuana. Never been a fan of it and still cant enjoy it like other people. Once I was past that initial panic, tho, it was a great fuckin high"
molly,ffdet2u,t3_eqtqob,1579819369.0,"I've got tmj and deal with this on acid. When I rolled for the first time the other day, I kept my jaw wide open because I was afraid of ot getting stuck because I knew I was grinding my teeth bad. Definitely talk to a doctor in case you also have tmj. People with tmj have to be weary of the drugs they take because of the physical reactions we have.

I looked pretty fuckin stupid with my jaw going in all directions but closed because of my fear of my jaw locking. There was pain for only about 48 hours and now my jaw feels fine. But if you were grinding your teeth that much, if you decide to roll again, might I suggest gum for something soft to chew so you dont ruin your teeth too much. And you can still talk. If you aren't gonna be a talker, maybe a mouthguard will help? Not sure how that would feel while rolling tho. I might buy one myself."

Then clothing, hair color if it stands out, and tattoos of they stand out. Its ever meant to offend people as it's for inhouse use only so we dont have to spend 10 years searching thousands of cameras if something goes wrong. And this way our relief people for breaks and the next shift can know exactly who is who so no one is giving the wrong info to the wrong customer. 

When I first started, it felt so wrong to enter in some of these descriptions. I could have a group of white males with black jackets because its winter. But one is old, another has glasses, third dude is bald, and the last one is in a wheelchair. 

It was always a relief when you memorized names and faces so descriptions could be smaller. But typing in personal information about people you were taught to always ignore growing up to avoid being ---ist was weird and uncomfortable. 3 years later and now it's the fastest formula I have for quickly describing someone i dont know. It actually made it way easier to recognize that people are still people despite looking different from the people i spent most of my childhood around."

AskReddit,fetvmcx,t3_eqfgfg,1579380525.0,"Ready or Not

I'm not much of a horror m/scary movie fan at all. Most of the same tropes and tactics are always recycled and also jump scares get me pretty bad. I went in this movie somewhat blind as I liked the fact it didn't seem supernatural at all. I was tired of ghosts and demons and gore fests so this seemed like it might be just right 

I ended up loving it. I was amazed at the variety of characters in it. I figured it would be all sadistic murderous people (it technically is) but instead they all were fairly well fleshed out characters. Plus, it was funny without being obnoxious or relying on the same ""gotcha"" humor a lot of films use. There was only one good gotcha at the end and it actually got me because up to this point I genuinely didn't think it would happen. I don't want to give a spoiler so if you're curious, just message me.

As far as crazy cult- likes murder house movies go,  this was a nice take. Well-to-do's rather than inbred forest dwellers.  Wasnt the whole town/ cops involved. Just the family. And the move seemed to make fun of campy horror slasher films in different ways. Some of the satire was definitely not lost on me.

Its almost always like twice as much for a guy than it is for a girl to come in. A lot of bars do this as well.

pokemon,fefwkfx,t1_fef3tzi,1579067550.0,"Well when the game itself is typically $40-60 and one plush is around $13-20, cards are $5 a pack and up to $30 for the big boxes, it makes sense. Because the people buying the games will maybe buy it once, possibly used. But they'll buy a plush or toy set of their fave pokemon (plural) 3 or 4 times. Then you've got tshirts and backpacks. I own a whole ass sweatsuit myself that costs more than the games do on launch. For every game being purchased, that same person is probably buying 3-5 pieces of merchandise.

For all the reasons already listed. But also, I dont really give a shit what anyone says about when you choose to dispose of your medication. I had a hysterectomy about 5 months ago. I used only some of my Hydrocodone since I had some of the shitty side effects. Also I hate taking medications that I'm sensitive to or can be addicting. But I also didn't dispose of it all immediately when I felt I was done because there are times they can be useful. I happen to have chronic pain and fairly bad spine issues. I dont take pain meds for it typically. But once or twice I've been unable to move after a long day of work and stuck bent forward and unable to stand up straight. Times like that, the pain meds have helped when I was in a bad way. 

My point is- a lot of people dont throw out their medications, Narcos or not, because they may use them in the future for a legitimate reason and are capable of using them responsibly and without it forming a habit. What you choose to do with your medication is entirely up to you. No one can make you throw it out. Bob stole from you and your wife. You've got no way of knowing who is or isn't an addict when they come into your house. You didn't have a loaded gun sitting on a table that they decided to play with. You had medication that was being responsibly used and stored. Your meds are your business and nobody else's.

relationship_advice,fcashfw,t3_egqob1,1577575737.0,"Get back into lifting again because it made you happier. Doesn't matter what he thinks. And since its healthy to do, I see no downside. Also, ask him more about the intimacy issues. I've got guy friends in their mid 30s that have literally almost no sex drive. It just doesn't interest them and takes way more effort than they want to put into it. They mostly have sex to appease their partners. He very well may be like them and just have no real sex drive anymore. These same guys loved sex as teenagers and up into their mid-late 20s. But now they literally just dont care about it outside of maybe a quick wank to release as fast as possible and the go to sleep. 

Be completely open and honest with him without necessarily being accusatory. If hes going through his own sexuality issues, it could be a sore subject for him. And if hes got something going on effecting his sex drive like depression, anxiety, or ED, it's worth it to be supportive and work it out together as a team. A lot of men have a hard time coming forward about their performance if they're having issues.

Big disclaimer here- its only a suggestion and not a rule of thumb. I do not know if this would work for the both of you--- if he really genuinely loves you and wants to spend the rest of his life with you, but just doesn't have sexual attraction to you, maybe talk about an open relationship of some sort. Where you can both have your needs satisfied physically but still have each other emotionally. I know this may not be a viable option to most people. But I've got some friends that are like this. One has a low sex drive while the other has a high one. They've been talking about marriage and buying a house together for quite some time. But they also have an open relationship sexually as a way to handle each others needs without one feeling too pressure and the other being too pent up and suffering emotionally/mentally over it. 

But if he just is indifferent to you entirely and doesn't even want to support your preferred workout regimen, I'd say it may be time to close this chapter of your life and move on. You both deserve to be happy in the end. But that doesn't mean you'll be happy with each other. Sit him down and have an open and honest conversation. And try not to let it become a fight or a way for either of you to start bashing each other. 

I hope some of this helps or at least encourages you to find more happiness. Good luck in all of this!"
