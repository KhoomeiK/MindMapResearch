AskDocs,fftaanx,t1_fft8683,1580214223.0,Please take the advice.  Do not lie to your doctors.  Their opinion of you as a person doesn't matter.  You're there for medical treatment and lying about your medical history is only going to make things worse. Please don't do this anymore.

AskDocs,fft7re5,t1_fft73ea,1580211294.0,"Could a physician really be held responsible by a reasonable judge considering the lawsuit would be based on her lying to them?  I'm not arguing in favor of her, I'm just curious if that really happens. It seems like the fact that the physician had been lied to, information omitted, etc., would alleviate the physician of most of the responsibility."
AskDocs,fft7itq,t3_ev45dq,1580210995.0,"I'm going to assume your reason for thinking this way is because you're young.  

Please please please don't forgo information or lie to your doctors.  If you feel like your doctors aren't being compassionate enough, find new doctors.  But don't lie to them.  They really need to know.  And sometimes, things that don't make sense to you make perfect sense to them, medically speaking, because they know a few things you don't know, again, medically speaking."
AskDocs,fft7b48,t3_ev1khu,1580210723.0,"I really think it would be in your best interest to see a doctor if you can.  Four months with no period is a really long time.  

You don't, by any chance, take birth control (even for reasons not associated with not becoming pregnant)?"
TrueOffMyChest,fft6k7c,t1_ffsgb3s,1580209716.0,"""knew the thoughts"" 

Look at how you're twisting the situation to make yourself look less wrong.  You're doubling down.  It has nothing at all to do with ""knowing the thoughts of people"".  That's like saying I would have a God complex because I know that 99% of people associate the American flag with America.  

The White House flew a rainbow flag in support of LGBT several years ago.  Think about that for a second.  Then tell me again through your implications how I am the delusional one."
TrueOffMyChest,ffsg4u6,t1_ffse6t0,1580180883.0,"Uhh, you're telling me that you don't think 99.9% of people would associate the rainbow flag in your house with LGBT?"

TrueOffMyChest,ffs10wt,t1_ffrur03,1580170523.0,"I'm not a paramedic and even I felt like this post was fishy - mostly because I cannot possibly imagine an ambulance not having the supplies required to treat an overdose on an ingested substance.  And I'm the guy who is usually telling people to fuck off for claiming posts are bullshit without any significant evidence, but this case is just a bit too far out.  I guess it could be a different country maybe, but still... I would imagine most developed countries have similar protocols."
AskDocs,ffrtl26,t1_ffrt8ln,1580165532.0,So cutting it off is not outside of the realm of possibility?
TrueOffMyChest,ffrt3dk,t1_ffqqpb5,1580165219.0,Asking a legitimate question doesn't make someone an asshole.  This patient was breathing when she was taken by paramedics.  She should not have died.  They were ill equipped.  This was also my first thought because the fact that she was conscious when paramedics arrived should have meant she recovered.  This adds up to: ambulance was not sufficiently equipped.  It has nothing to do with the OP and everything to do with the administrators in charge of deciding what goes into the ambulance and making sure it's all there at all times.
TrueOffMyChest,ffrsss8,t1_ffq5a9j,1580165032.0,"Shouldn't pretty much all ambulances have this kind of stuff on board?  Now that you know they didn't have it, do you think the outcome would have been different if they would have?"

photography,ffpejea,t3_ethmxr,1580093070.0,"What is the best basic setup for a beginner who wants to explore the possibility of photography as a hobby?  I want to be able to take high quality photographs and I would like something waterproof or with attachments that make it waterproof as well as the ability to do super slow motion (super slow relative to my phone's ability to do 480fps at 720p, maybe something like 2,500 fps at 1080p or whatever is available with my budget).  

Basically (in order of preference):

Decent slow motion, at least better than my phone.  
Long exposure would be great
Zoom would be cool
High quality standard photos
Stabilization

I wouldn't want to spend much more than a couple hundred dollars on the camera.  I could spend a few hundred I guess, but I'd like to keep it under 5. I'm sure this gets asked a lot but I don't want to dig through any posts where I may find the answer 2 comments down or 500 pages down.  It's easier to just ask here. Lol

What could I get that would most closely match what I'm hoping for with a $200-$350 budget?

Thank you in advance."
