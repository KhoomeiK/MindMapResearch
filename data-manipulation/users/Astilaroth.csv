HumansBeingBros,ffg7rrb,t1_ffg7d5j,1579900292.0,"Sucks doesn't it. Had my anxiety perfectly under control but after my first kid I just wanted to be with him all the time. Went back to therapy for a bit. Much better now, not that I like it but yeah I really don't want my issues to become his. If my own mom had therapy I would probably have needed a lot less or none. So that shit stops with me."

HumansBeingBros,ffg2odt,t1_fffzbnd,1579897153.0,"Yeah I'm super anxious, hate driving, scared in traffic but on a plane I am just still in awe of the fact that I'm flying and fully at peace with a quick gory death. Haven't flown since I've become a parent though, not sure if that ramps up my fears to that level."

Ugh that would be a Dark Mirror episode really."
HumansBeingBros,ffd550g,t1_ffcppn6,1579813613.0,"Aww yeah when I had my 2nd kid she was clusterfeeding and I was exhausted, was on the sofa with her and my toddler put a blanket over my legs. Will never forget that. At the same time I felt like crap too cause it was a rough period back then and I'm sure he picked up on that."
