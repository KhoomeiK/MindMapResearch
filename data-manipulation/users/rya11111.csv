whatcarshouldIbuy,ffw0lvk,t3_evc6bd,1580279426.0,"Both are good. I tried them both and chose Mazda. My reasoning was Mazda

- looked better
- had better stereo. The Bose system is amazing
- feels better inside


Found overall ride quality and space pretty similar and I guess its a bit more expensive but its worth it imo. I feel the civic has a bit more sporty engine but if I wanted a track car I wouldn't be choosing either. I mean it wasn't like Mazda's engine was a deal breaker. Toyota's was lol.

Test drive them both."
