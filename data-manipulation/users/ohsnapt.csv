it was scary. i was feeling kind of insane. went to an energy healer, she cleared my shit up, but also she explained that i was too ""open"" that spirit and consciousness was like a subway station, and you can't just open yourself up to everything. she gave me a meditation about a volume knob, as in turning down the volume

once i had this idea to do mushrooms (which ive done several times) in a ""spriritual way alone"" to illuminate some things. i researched it, and set an intention and did it at night in my apartment. 

""careful what you wish for"" said the mushrooms. I can't explain why but it went real dark, the pain of existence type stuff. No visuals,  I was just sad, and afraid and lonely, dark. At one point in the middle of the night i called my friend and just screamed into her answering machine, all terrified of ....something

Silence. ""She is asleep. There ain't nobody coming to fix your sadness you fucking whiny entitled bitch. You wanted to be here in an intentional wisdom setting and now here we are. Now stop crying and handle yo business."" 

Damn mushrooms i thought we were friends, you cold as ice. So i went for a walk, smoked a bowl, ate some food, changed the music, and forcibly changed my trip and the sun rose and it was a fucking relief.
