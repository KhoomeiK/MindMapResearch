rant,fffan30,t1_fff6qt1,1579879757.0,"I've been followed by a car to the parking lot by my house. Only a few weeks ago. I stood my ground tho, I think it seemed too much of a hassle  for him after I stayed in the car, had my lights on and showed him the phone in my hand. He left.

It's so crazy what the world has become. I live in a town with only 200 people"
rant,fff676y,t1_fff427o,1579876733.0,"Yeah, after getting some steam out, it also made me crack up."

rant,ffeyd3a,t1_ffewfkp,1579870298.0,I locked my bedroom. Yeah it was quite dumb anyway
sex,ffczra0,t1_ffcyhi6,1579810598.0,Do you have experience with this? Cause I'm on antidepressants and I'm curious.
DiWHY,fekhlue,t3_epflug,1579200212.0,...is cement the new hot clue?
vaginismus,feho62q,t3_ep1f65,1579120510.0,You can do it! I believe in you!
sex,feai7ag,t3_eo8ubr,1578949065.0,"You speak from my soul with this!

To avoid the leaking my boyfriend and I go to the bathroom together and clean each other up, makes everything even more fun."
halloween,feaa1gh,t1_fea330e,1578946139.0,Thanks!
AskReddit,fe9n2j4,t3_eo3q9l,1578939608.0,Sitting naked next to my step dad naked isn't a thing I would have planned for today...
vaginismus,fdx1pjt,t3_ena1gn,1578764402.0,"I'm glad you found positions that worked for you!

I totally agree. Trying different positions helped me so much, alone and when having sex.

If the regular known ones don't work for you, experiment! I'm not sure the one that works best for me even has a name lol."
WarriorCats,fdpzgjy,t1_fdp6g3y,1578647326.0,"Thank you!
No I laminated it to keep it save for shipping.
I do commissions tho"
WarriorCats,fdoplta,t1_fdopgr5,1578610031.0,Thank you!
sex,fdojeny,t1_fdoid6g,1578606351.0,"Ok, it's seems like the bad tasting cum is the minority"
sex,fdof0lv,t1_fdoei4f,1578603873.0,"Yeah, that's definitly the kick about it, seeing, feeling and tasting how much he enjoyed it"
sex,fdo18g4,t3_emaipk,1578597017.0,"Ahhh I feel you. I'm on the pill and love cream pies, but damn I'm always so afraid after. 
Sadly nothing is ever really 100% save, like the others said. I, myself am only here because my mothers pill failed because she took antibiotics at the time."
sex,fdo0ogw,t3_em4q7i,1578596701.0,I tried searching for girls only once. All just looking for an gay adventure or a third girl for sex. It's so frustrating.
vaginismus,fdnzjd0,t1_fdny9pw,1578596030.0,"I'd really recommend a therapist then. It helped me a lot. As far as I know there also ones more specialized in that kind of stuff, although I had a regular one. 
If you're generally in flow with yourself it will really help you with everything.
Good luck, you can do it!"
vaginismus,fdnsew2,t3_emckuf,1578591892.0,"I know it's hard. But I think it's your fear that's making it worse. Have you ever been to a therapist? The fear of not beeing good enough isn't something you overcome easily.

Also what I experienced myself and there're studies on it, that your libido goes down more and more if you're not active (not just piv or something, just sexual in general). I've had that myself. I didn't allow myself to feel that way and when I wanted it again at first it didn't work.

I'm no expert, but what does your doc say about the possibilty of the ovaries beeing partly responsible for you Vaginismus?"
vaginismus,fdn86zz,t1_fdn182h,1578579904.0,"I also still have it sometimes. But only when he's first entering, after that it's gone, no matter how often he inserts it afterwards"
vaginismus,fdmz5xd,t3_em70ea,1578572103.0,"Vaginismus can be caused by trauma and of course if already existant can be made worse.

I too had problems before but an awfully painfull doc appointment made it go through the roof. 

So yes, I think it could still be Vaginismus. 

I was also not able to do certain positions, have doc appointments, even after I was able to have piv sex."
vaginismus,fdkqfsn,t3_elvt0o,1578509006.0,"Don't know the english term tbh, but I used a vibrator for a long time, that you just lay on your vulva, you don't have to insert it at all. 
I also used it with my boyfriend, before I was able to have piv sex."
cats,fdkq3ey,t1_fdkpkqy,1578508802.0,...ok you didn't lie. I'm proud of you
raisedbynarcissists,fdjmfjh,t1_fdjm3kd,1578477938.0,Why?
raisedbynarcissists,fdi9im1,t1_fdi8m58,1578438158.0,"I'm trying. I'm trying to come to some kind of closure. I think it will take some time for me to come to peace with that part of my life. I'm still seeing a therapist, so I hope that helps also."
raisedbynarcissists,fdi1mi0,t1_fdi10aq,1578434133.0,"Thank you. 
No and it's not like she's treating me differently since I moved to my own place. Still the same. Expects me to do her house hould. I only clean the chicken house because I can't stand seeing them sitting in their filth because of her..."
vaginismus,fd3pb9w,t3_ejz0ea,1578160543.0,"Oh lord, that happens to me nearly everytime when switching positions xD"
sex,fcz1mn2,t3_ejhvq4,1578091847.0,"My first sex partner said after he dumped me for another girl, that he never really enjoyed our sex and the time we spent together. I knew this wasn't true and that likely his new girlfriend made him say this, because back in the days he always asked  me when I would come over again. But damn these words affected me. 
I'm having sex and meeting up with another guy I've known for years. I just can't get myself to not worry, that he's using me and likely will have enough of me in a few weeks.

Please people, don't do such shit to a person."
vaginismus,fcxedmp,t3_ejbtqn,1578060707.0,"Well I can only speak from personal experience here. I saw a doctor before starting to dialte, but just to make sure there's no physical cause for my problems. 
So if you never had a doc check you out down there, I'd do that first. In my country you don't need a referral, but I don't know how it is somewhere else"
offmychest,fcvrg5c,t1_fcvr608,1578008421.0,"Thanks for the tip, I didn't knew you can do it by yourself. Let's hope I'll never need this knowledge"
offmychest,fcvnwu1,t1_fcvnost,1578006170.0,I totally agree
offmychest,fcvniui,t1_fcvnc4j,1578005925.0,Yes. I mean I can totally understand that most people don't have a clue what to do when someone os choking. But calling for help is something nearly everyone can do
offmychest,fcvn5rb,t1_fcvmyob,1578005697.0,"Thank you.
Yes they truely can be... That's what makes nice people like tge life guard even more important"
vaginismus,fcigep6,t1_fchykf4,1577662140.0,"I totally agree. I never knew this was even a thing until someone on Reddit told me. Before that I thought I was just worrying too much, because really everyone including doctors told me that."
vaginismus,fcfqowu,t1_fcff5vc,1577632791.0,"That's a good idea, I always put them them under my legs for some time before I start"
vaginismus,fc5a1a7,t3_eg3ab7,1577450534.0,"Did you pull it out immediatly after experiencing the pain? I'm not sure, if you're describing the same pain I had, but it faded away for me after I kept the dilator in."
vaginismus,fc2a577,t3_efrd0b,1577348068.0,"Nice, I'm so happy for you!!"
