Brown arrived in Boston, found out nobody was showing up for his show, and was going to not go on stage because it wouldn't be worth it for him to perform to such a small crowd.

The mayor begged him to perform and let them televise it to keep people inside watching TV instead of rioting.

Aaaaand by using that phrase, you just lost any credibility given it is used to mock people who object to vast spread of lies, criminal activity, and general shitty behavior by the president.

> the visits are meant to make sure people with visas are not committing fraud instead of scooping up illegals because they’re brown or something

What the reporter actually said:

> ICE officials verify visa documents are up to date and authentic, and will also check worksites and potentially ask about how the university funds or decides upon the students’ salaries.

> Yossi Sheffi, director of MIT’s Center for Transportation and Logistics, told the Globe that the visit could be a good way to make sure students were in a workplace with fair labor standards. 

and of course you left out this bit:

> President Trump has been cracking down on visa fraud, **often through questionable means**. Last year, the Detroit Free Press uncovered that ICE in 2015 created a fake University of Farmington to track visa fraud.  About 250 students were arrested, but some of the students who were not deported are suing ICE, saying they were duped and lured to the program."
boston,fe4e7m1,t1_fe302h0,1578858378.0,"Stallman was a disgusting creep who for decades had made really sketchy comments about pedophilia, age/consent, etc.

There's video of him, on stage during a talk, **picking toe-cheese and eating it.**

He kept a mattress in his office that frequently had half-naked people on it, and this went on for two decades after he stopped **living in his office**, and whenever women had to come into his office, he'd try to get them to lie on it.

Women at CSAIL found out he was afraid of house plants and started keeping large collections of plants in the offices because it was the only way to keep him from wandering in and harassing them. He handed out ""pleasure cards"" to women, including researchers and students at CSAIL. He had a wide-spread reputation for approaching women **and threatening to kill himself if they didn't date him.**

 Around a place like MIT where the ground he walked on was worshipped (and still is by a large contingent of MIT and FSF - numerous board members have extensively defended him), that's a huge problem. He was treated like a god/emperor. What do you do if you're a 20 year old CS student and the god of open source says he'd kill himself if you won't fuck him?

He's completely uncompromising in his utopian vision that everyone involved in the production of computer hardware and software will publish their source code and designs *once he convinces them of the error of their ways*, oblivious to how the vast majority of industries, goods, and services work. He's a computer science student version of a college student who reads some Karl Marx and is all ""WHOA THIS MAN IS A GENIUS THIS IS THE SOLUTION!"" He has failed to see that his vision will never come to fruition, and he's incredibly bitter about how Linux has become a global phenomenon, a massive powerhouse - and the GNU project is little more than a young step-brother. Meanwhile, he has zero usable job skills because his programming skills stalled around the 70's/80's, and now that he's been fired from MIT, he'll basically be living off benefactors and social security, I guess?

He blamed being fired from MIT as a witch hunt, by the way - as did numerous FSF board members. Didn't take any personal responsibility. Not even to admit he should have realized ""MIT is under fire for accepting money and allowing onto campus a child molester. **Maaaaaaaybe I shouldn't stick my neck up and remind everyone of my decades of comments saying that pedophilia isn't actually A Thing right now?**""

""Nah. Lemme post shit on **technical mailing lists** about this. Because I am right, and all that needs to happen is I need to explain myself until everyone sees my genius and agrees with me.""

Stallman is the original neckbeard, the original nerd mansplainer."
