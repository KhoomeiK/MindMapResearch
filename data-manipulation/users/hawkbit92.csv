AskReddit,fdssjpq,t3_emuqea,1578707388.0,Went out to dinner and had two margaritas with my boyfriend. We decided to go see some of our friends play some music at this local dive bar in the city. We get there and instead of drinking we decide to hit this joint with one friend outside. I only took one hit and I was instantly sent into this real heady high and then panic mode. I sat at the bar just trying to lower my heart rate down and hoping I wasn't being too obvious about the doom I was feeling. So I asked my boyfriend if we could go home and we did. When we got home I wanted to distract myself so I thought mario kart would be fun! I didn't realize until the 2nd lap that I literally could not control the car and go in the right direction. It was pitiful. I never been so inept at playing a pretty simple video game ever. Never going to mix alcohol and weed again.

Didn't matter if it was a day or two in advance she would cancel... or the day of...or the hour of our plans together. If I would say something to voice my feelings about her flaking all the time I would get verbal lashings for days on end. Abusive raging texts all hours of the night. It took me literally ten years of ""friendship""(quotes because it was so fake) to understand what she was doing to me. Having to put my needs and time on the back burner just to keep her from getting so mad at me. Last time I saw her she fought with me over me going and visiting my boyfriend at college when I was 17 instead of going to the gym with her. That was 9 years ago. I was expected to bend over backwards for her because she was ""sensitive"". Its such a load of BS. I wouldn't DARE tell her she hurt my feelings for fear of that rage."

I can't stand it. My whole family is like this. No one ever listens to me. I've told my dad my job so many god damn times and he STILL says ""I don't know what you do!"". I'm not sure if its because I'm the youngest, but I always have to repeat myself over and over again."

AskWomen,fcfw3fa,t3_egx7on,1577634283.0,We had planned a double date with our boyfriends. My boyfriend and I showed up on time and waited 45 minutes for her and her boyfriend to show. She texted me after 45 min and told me they went home because they couldn't find parking. Ugh. So I said that wasn't cool that they had us waiting for them and they just don't show up. I told her we ordered food for the table and wine. She proceeded to send me texts upon texts about how horrible I was to even say her behavior was rude and that I am this god awful mean person who doesn't understand her. She ended up texting me for four days straight non stop day and night about how terrible I am. It was insane. She had a bad habit of being really late to meeting up or just cancelling last minute with me all the time so I was just fed up. Never be friends with someone who can't commit to a commitment ever.
