A usage is ""If you use speech to dehumanize a group of people based on basic criteria of their person (gender, race, faith and so on), than you act illegal"".

These two elements are vastly different, as the outlawing of content is undemocratic and a violation of human rights, while the reglimentation to protect citizen's rights is both okay according to democratic theory and internationall recognized human rights.

The question is where to draw the line, which rights of people are protected. The US interpretation of these rights draw the line by direct incitment of violence, but that is, as mentioned before, a new developement of the US since the civil rights act at which point the openly racist faced situations where they couldn't be openly racist anymore and thus, pushed in the supreme court for a movement of that line. In the past, incitment to hatred was also illegal, than, because racists wanted to incite hatred, they moved the goal post to incitment to indirect violence, but again, because people wanted to say ""WE should be allowed to kill blacks"" they moved it to direct violence.

The ideal marketplace of idea that your theory is based on only workes with an idealized human logic, where only the argument with the best reasoning succeeds. That was the understanding of the time of enlightenment when that idea was introduced, but this premise is disprooven by psychology and sociology.

Humans are emotional beings, and every human, even if they try to be as unbias as possible, has emotions that taint their view on issues. That is the reason why emotional truths are so strong, because, if your emotional connection to a theory is strong enough, factual evidence become less and less relevant.

The marketplace of ideas does not work on extremist views because of that, they are often carried solely or mostly on emotional truths, meaning they are outside of the factual or discussion based system the market place of ideas works with.

I don't say the marketplace of ideas is irrelevant, quite the opposit, but that the pure form of it that you propose is, in my opinion, based on flawed idealism that isn't reflected in reality. If an ideal does not match reality, we have not to stop that ideal, but adapt it so that it better reflect reality.

The marketplace of ideas has to be adapted in a manner that these emotional truths that are outside the reach of the marketplace of ideas do not unjustly hurt others. And yes, if a group is pushed to the fringes in society by incitment to hatred of the masses, they are limited in their democratic rights, they are limited in social participation, they are limited in democratic participation, not to mention that their human dignity is severly in danger if groups portray them as subhuman in society.

Our logic is always, even with people that are trying to be as unbias as possible, clouded with emotions. Because of that, these emotional truths are so strong, and you can give as many counter evidences as you want with little chance to change them.

So, the marketplace of ideas works as long as an argument not completely or mostly relies on emotional truths. Here, the marketplace of ideas has to be, if it is not pure empty ideology but adjusted to psychological facts, constructed to prevent abuse of emotional truths to.protect these that are vulnerable.

Simple test, every single definition of socialism has one common feature: The absent of privat property of the productive means. If companys exist that are held and controled by privat citizens, especially large companies, a system can't be socialist. Democratic socialism is a term for a society in which all companies are in the posession of a democratically elected body in some form. Other examples of socialism that are not democratic socialism would be workers councils, where every company is owned by the workforce working in it, because it misses the democratic element for the complete society.

Social democracy on the other hand is a system where the Government has the constitutional duty to provide a minimum standard of living for the people. And because these protective right are legally ensrined rights, the people have a right to go to court because of these rights, in difference to the US, where the constitutional framework does not exist to force the state even against a combined legislative and executive power to care for the needs of their people.

These religion classes are based on a governmental ciriculum.

> Visual acuity, the sharpness of the eye to fine detail, is a major component of a human's visual system. It requires not only the muscles of the eye – the muscles of orbit and the ciliary muscles – to be able to focus on a particular object through contraction and relaxation, but other parts of the retina such as the fovea to project a clear image on the retina. The muscles that initiate movement start to strengthen from birth to 2 months, at which point infants have control of their eye. However, images still appear unclear at two months due to other components of the visual system like the fovea and retina and the brain circuitry that are still in their developmental stages. This means that even though an infant is able to focus on a clear image on the retina, the fovea and other visual parts of the brain are too immature to transmit a clear image. Visual acuity in newborns is very limited as well compared to adults – being 12 to 25 times worse than that of a normal adult.[3] It is important to note that the distance from the cornea at the front of the infant's eye to the retina which is at the back of eye is 16–17 mm at birth, 20 to 21 mm at one year, and 23–25 mm in adolescence and adulthood.[1] This results in smaller retinal images for infants. The vision of infants under one month of age ranges from 6/240 to 6/60 (20/800 to 20/200).[4] By two months, visual acuity improves to 6/45 (20/150). By four months, acuity improves by a factor of 2 – calculated to be 6/18 (20/60) vision. As the infant grows, the acuity reaches the healthy adult standard of 6/6 (20/20) at six months.["

It has two gists: First, that way of running has some historical presedence, and is known under two names: Ninja running, or girly running xD .

But it was chosen for animation purposes, but already in the 50's and 60's, and became so commen already at that time that it became part of the anime style just as eventually big eyes. And it was also done not really only for running, but running with a sword or scabber, but than was applied more and more to normal running.

So, while the animation has improved massivly since than, because it is now a common trope that is interwoven with that kind of art-style, it is hard to get rid of."

One of the current strongest centrists out there is for example Merkel, who is known to have pushed the formerly rather right leaning CDU more and more in the center of the political spectrum, adapting sollutions of the political left while still staying on the moderate right side.

Don't just trash centrism, because a society can only properly work form its center, not from its fringes. That is just a spiral down the gutter.
