Gamingcirclejerk,ffedmq0,t1_ffdvcbj,1579844151.0,"Yeah, stuff like this really makes me dislike this subreddit sometimes. This shit is harmless. What’s the problem?"
gamegrumps,ffed7fg,t1_ffcia6b,1579843748.0,"No, it’s definitely lost what it was originally made for. It may have been for valid issues once, but it’s turned into a place mostly to complain about worthless shit, and to insult the Grumps."

Or just steal the dog."
truegaming,ffcnq7z,t1_ffcfimd,1579803356.0,My only issue with that subreddit is that it still holds on to the goddamn Witcher circlejerk.

Gamingcirclejerk,ff80xf7,t1_ff6jpok,1579663115.0,"Well, comparing the two is fairly easy... 

If you only go with “authoritarian scumbags that killed a lot of people.”"

warcraftlore,ff6tein,t1_ff6tbul,1579634499.0,"No, it’s entirely fair. In one thread, I disagreed about something fairly minor, and a user went *off,* calling me all kinds of shit. I reported all of the comments, but they were never removed."

SubredditDrama,ff39opi,t1_ff39dfp,1579536963.0,"Some indie devs made a jokingly sassy post for their loyal fans concerning their exclusivity deal with Epic. And because it was directed at their closest followers, people that had following development for a while, they understood that it was meant in fun, and didn’t flip out. 

But the Anti-Epic people took this post, which wasn’t aimed at them, and went with it. “Look how these bastard devs treat their fans! Such ingrates! Vile people!” And it snowballed from there into death threats and the like."

hearthstone,ff35oli,t1_ff33zsj,1579534281.0,"And that’s kinda what they do. A handful of wisps can fucking vaporize people, literally."
warcraftlore,ff35ggt,t1_ff33uie,1579534129.0,They thought the Wisps were Loa. The Ancients are already the same classification as the other beast Loa — Wild Gods.
warcraftlore,ff352h6,t3_er1x2v,1579533865.0,Sorry about the responses you got. This subreddit has become more about complaining than anything else.
SubredditDrama,ff34s75,t1_ff2zhrw,1579533667.0,"No, with the Ooblets situation, the sub was justified in mocking gamers. They acted poorly."

hearthstone,feymow7,t1_fey890x,1579447660.0,Maybe? Can’t remember. But Blizzard very much retconned old worgen lore.

customhearthstone,feykis9,t1_feyj58o,1579446781.0,"It’s a Warcraft thing. When the orcs began to be corrupted by demon influence, the spirits stopped answering their call, and so many orc shaman turned to fel magic as a result.

hearthstone,fewu0y4,t1_fewtuxx,1579419482.0,"The pack form was literally a wolf form. They turned into wolves. The Scythe of Elune was created to try and help them control it, but turned them into the worgen instead, which created the curse. Malfurion took those Druids that were cursed and put them in the Emerald Dream, where they slept until Arugal summoned them at the behest of Genn Greymane to protect Gilneas from the Scourge."
