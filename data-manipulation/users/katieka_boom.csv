GestationalDiabetes,ff9pg8e,t1_ff9iz2l,1579717995.0,I'm only 14 weeks. It's just odd and frustrating that my numbers were fine post-breakfast and not terrible fasting until the exact moment they put me on insulin. Like I already basically can't eat a single carb at breakfast without spiking.
ADHD,ff7ut91,t1_ff7sc7s,1579658878.0,Thank you for this reply. Getting his diagnosis took a lot of persistence on my part because he also isn't acting out or outwardly showing any behavioral problems. He just cannot stay on task to save his life but because he isn't putting on antics he just got labeled as lazy for a long time.
ADHD,ff7umj6,t1_ff7tebu,1579658754.0,"He's really introverted and would probably spend 8 hours a day glued to his Xbox playing Minecraft if I let him. We've cut out screen time on his regular doctor's recommendation, so he spends a lot of time reading or inventing things with Legos. I've tried to set up play dates with kids his age but he seems to prefer doing his own thing. My husband and I both work pretty demanding full time jobs but on the weekends we have him home we tend to go out to local entertainment whether it's theme parks or swimming or what-have-you. 

On his weekends with his dad I'm 90% sure he just gets parked in front of the Xbox while his dad naps or hangs out with his buddies. Unfortunately there seems to be little to nothing I can do about that situation."
ADHD,ff7s7rn,t1_ff7rnw2,1579657086.0,"You're absolutely right. Math is his favorite and he consistently rips through those assignments and even does more than required to get extra credit. Things like writing and social studies where the answers are less black and white and he has to write out his opinions on things seem to be things he really struggles with. 

I'm trying not to be a huge helicopter parent where his teacher is concerned. She doesn't assign homework and only sends grades/completed work home but once every few weeks so it's hard to know what his progress is like in order to give those immediate rewards without hounding her for daily reports. Would you think a weekly report/ reward system would satisfy that itch or is that too long to maintain motivation?"
GestationalDiabetes,ff7pqtr,t1_ff6r133,1579655364.0,I'm currently on vistaril per my OB. It hasn't done a damn thing unfortunately.
GestationalDiabetes,ff7i192,t3_es34mp,1579650025.0,Or ice cream. He tried to do that in front of me recently and I sent him to the garage to eat it in shame like a feral animal instead.
GestationalDiabetes,ff6nozc,t1_ff6kkeh,1579631083.0,"Unfortunately no. All the pregnancy safe meds I've already failed in the last several years. I've done therapy for years but absolutely none of it prepared me for how bad it's gotten without meds. ""Herbal"" remedies are medically legal in my state, but again, no safety during pregnancy. It seems like I'm in the clench my teeth and soldier through it phase right now. Days aren't super bad, but my sleep is definitely suffering big time."
GestationalDiabetes,ff4tj5d,t1_ff4pshw,1579572090.0,"I feel like doctors are like that in general, particularly if you're even the least bit overweight. I have always been big and broad shouldered and even at my thinnest my doctors still were ""shocked"" that my numbers were so good at my size. No matter that that size was perfectly average at worst."
GestationalDiabetes,ff4nig9,t1_ff4mnnb,1579567917.0,"I was just so confused because I see an endocrinologist specifically to manage the PCOS and prevent the full blown 'beetus, haven't had concerning labs, and suddenly two doctors are telling me I was probably diabetic all along. 

And I guess, maybe? But my normal A1C readings sure as hell weren't because I was watching my carb intake so it made no sense. Bodies are weird."
GestationalDiabetes,ff4moq6,t1_ff4j31f,1579567333.0,"I'm trying but I have pretty crippling anxiety which is currently unmedicated since my meds are known to cause a variety of birth defects. All I hear in my head is my (very shitty) mom telling me if I just did x, y, and z better it wouldn't be happening. I know that's not at all true but then to have doctors tell me I must have secretly been diabetic all along sent me into a spiral."
GestationalDiabetes,ff4mdbv,t1_ff4l13y,1579567109.0,"I mean, I didn't go overboard pre-pregnancy but I definitely ate the hell out of some carbs. Which is what I'm sure is responsible for my higher A1C numbers at times because they were definitely during times I was stress eating more often. But the PCOS insulin resistance I'm sure complicates that too."
PCOS,ferj3kz,t1_fer676d,1579354547.0,The manufacturer usually offers coupons for reduced copays or copay assistance. My Endo just kept me stocked in free samples when I was using it.
GestationalDiabetes,felrf4f,t3_epqxzb,1579229099.0,Picking at my sad lunch while the rest of the office eats pizza.
GestationalDiabetes,fe5u3ef,t3_enrakw,1578874966.0,I'm only 13 weeks but I am eating a celebratory Oreo cookie after delivery and my doctor can kick rocks if she tries to stop me.
GestationalDiabetes,fe33z7k,t1_fe33san,1578845700.0,Is there anything high protein that's breakfasty that isn't eggs? I can't even stand the sight of eggs right now!
PCOS,fdf9fkc,t3_el2ux3,1578356397.0,"I think a lot of it depends on your goals of treatment and whether or not insulin resistance is a factor. If fertility is a goal for you, GYN would be a good place to start whereas if you have serious insulin resistance and are more concerned with managing that then Endo would be your go-to. 

Ultimately for me I needed both. Endo was necessary to understand the root of my insulin resistance and the fertility problems only fell in line once that was under control."
cats,fdcd6fq,t1_fdccpep,1578272031.0,We were very very fortunate to be able to scrape together the funds for surgery. We might be eating ramen for a while but the important thing is that we still have our boy. I'm sorry to hear about yours. Losing a friend is an awful thing.
cats,fd93rhy,t1_fd8cxvk,1578227958.0,"Yes, he will be on prescription diet going forward, although his issue was determined to be caused by a physical stricture related to his spinal injury."
cats,fd69i4n,t1_fd68w8k,1578187579.0,"It was the worst! We spent almost the entire week trying to get him unblocked but in the end his doctor had to do a perineal urethrostomy surgery to fix it. Recovery will be more difficult since he has a spinal injury and his bladder has to be manually expressed, but the good news is that if we make it through the next week or so the chances of him blocking again are much much less."
GestationalDiabetes,fcsl937,t1_fcsl34z,1577918894.0,"Oh yeah the thought of smoked salmon texturally alone turns my stomach right now, though the rest sounds good. I wonder what else I could replace it with to bulk out the protein that wouldn't set off my puke-o-meter."
AskReddit,fclrgsn,t1_fclquy4,1577754678.0,Same here. Administration wants twice the work from half the staff but don't pay appropriately for anyone to put up with that. I left to work private practice and the money isn't as good but I get to keep my sanity and that's a fair trade.
AskReddit,fclq9rc,t1_fclq1ja,1577753848.0,There are many reasons I left inpatient nursing. Having to stroke the egos of doctors like that are one of them.
AskReddit,fclpxpv,t1_fclpeat,1577753617.0,"""I mean, if you wanna kill a patient that's on you, doc, but could you at least come to the floor to assume responsibility for it yourself before they code? """
AskReddit,fcl4s5t,t3_ehqlpz,1577739803.0,"Came on shift to see patient labs with a potassium level of 8.2 (which can make you very dead very fast). It took 8 hours of calling, paging, harassing office staff to get ahold of the physician (who also works primary care so is not usually at the hospital) by which time thankfully administration plus the rapid response team and intensivist had facilitated the patient's transfer to the ICU. Had they not stepped in to allow the appropriate orders to be entered the patient could have died. This was not an unusual occurrence for that MD and they are  still allowed to practice at that hospital."
nursing,fck6gwq,t3_ehgune,1577717937.0,Saw a post in a local community awareness Facebook page warning people to not go to the local ER because they had to wait *gasp!* 6 hours to be seen for a non-emergent flu/cold. Comments full of people upset that coming in via EMS does not guarantee you immediate treatment for non-life threatening illnesses that could have been handled at an urgent care or waited until Monday for their PCP. The entitlement got real gross real quick.
Anxiety,fbzjp79,t3_ef8g9d,1577248985.0,"Thanks for this post. Went full no-contact with my mom today after she visited for the weekend and said/did a lot of really horrible things, which was really just the culmination of decades of mental abuse and gaslighting. It was absolutely necessary for my mental stability but it has been a very very hard day."
