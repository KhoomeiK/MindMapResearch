I originally had what you suggested, but it didn't make a difference so I started setting the options specifically as well. Then I added the parent interface in on the relay, but still no dice.

When I go back to the Web GUI and define the DHCP relay settings, then go to the WLAN settings and turn on DHCP relay and then force the provision of the device not only does it revert back to DHCP being set to none, it completely wipes out the dhcp-relay configuration in the CLI.

I feel like I might need to set something on fire here soon.

I'm not a huge networking guy, but it wouldn't be necessary to set IP helpers on the switch unless I was actually routing through it, correct? The VLANs are configured because it's L2, but I don't have any L3 settings configured on that switch."

Last night I went a little bonkers basically trying everything I could. I deleted the dhcp-relay in the CLI so now I have nothing there. I would have to go back in and run the set command again (I think it's set, not too familiar with their CLI right now).

>Have you put VLAN 30 on a wired port to ensure that you can get DHCP responses on a wired connection for testing?

Kind of. I added another virtual adapter tagged for 30 on the server to test that with but it didn't work. If I swapped the adapter NIC to be tagged for 20 it works fine (for that particular VLAN subnet).

>Are you marking the wireless network to use the specified VLAN under the advanced settings?

Not in this case. I have it plugged into an untagged port with the PVID 30. If I use the USGs DHCP it doesn't have any problems.

If I'm looking at Wireshark I can see devices making DHCP requests, but that's all. My assumption is that there is nothing being broadcast to respond, but I don't know why.
