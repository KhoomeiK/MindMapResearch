AskMen,ffij48s,t1_ffiico2,1579975095.0,"Ok i was wrong,sorry for that

I am a student of law and an active memmber of an organisation within the institution that holds substantial influence

Over time,i noticed how much dominance and confidence were important(sometimes even crucial) in both presentation and the perception of the memmbers of leading student councils(including rival organisations) had.
I had a chance to talk to the president of the institution and he explicitly stated that to succeed in this field you must exibit”total confidence and power,even if it might seem irrational sometimes, as long as it works for your own benefit”

I was always hesitant  to show my own thoughts and ideas if i felt they would cause conflict and witnessing how the people in my enviroment excelled in exhibiting this skill did alot to change my perspective"
