college,ffb9bqo,t3_esm32j,1579755938.0,"From my experience as a former dual-enrollment student at a community college, my morning classes were 100% other dual enrollment kids, and my evening classes were almost evenly split among dual enrollment students and older students. Also classes after 11am tended to have a good amount of “traditional” students since most of the dual enrollment students only do it part-time and need to head back to the high school. Just something to think about when you choose classes for next semester."
college,feh11vb,t3_ep0shw,1579106907.0,"I'm an international relations major in the US. Here, getting a bachelor's isn't good enough if you want to work in the field and you'll have to get a master's. With just a bachelor's, you won't get very far and it has a reputation as being one of those useless degrees. However, when I was applying to college I asked r/PoliticalScience about an IR degree and if it really is useless, and many of them said it's actually considered a prestigious degree in some European countries, so that could be true for Turkey as well. (I deleted the post though, sorry.) I recommend you go there to ask about your degree and it's usefulness in Turkey specifically. Best of luck!"

college,fcy86yk,t1_fcy67wg,1578076173.0,"I'm a first year but I'm not transferring because I already have 60 credits from dual enrollment, AP, and CLEP, so I can graduate next year, either in December or even May if I take some summer classes. I can stick it out until then. If I still had 3 more years to go I'd definitely transfer though. I mostly hate it because I wanted a fresh start someplace new (as in out of state, but it was too expensive). I'm also tried of running into people from high school, lol. I already started taking some upper level classes and it's a little better, but I think it comes with time more than the class level."
college,fcy40ai,t1_fcxvaab,1578074437.0,"Seconded. I'm at GSU too and I also kind of hate it but I'm going to stick it out. I will say that A LOT of students here want to transfer. I don't know about the campus culture of UIUC vs ISU, but personally I would be more motivated and happier at a school that people actually want to be at vs doing their best to get out."
college,fcy1lfo,t3_ejeuio,1578073455.0,"Considering that you want to be an accountant for the job security, it sounds like you're more concerned about financial stability and therefore I'd chose Illinois State for you. You might find some really great opportunities there.

I'll tell you my situation last year. Although I was admitted to my dream school with the major I wanted, I went to my state school because I wouldn't have to pay anything to go there. Plus all my credits from dual enrollment (and AP) transfered so I can graduate one and a half to two years early. However, I'm not 100% fulfilled with my choice. I didn't want to even go there, like at all. It's a good school, though there are better public schools in the state. It was also the ""safe"" option for other reasons besides financial. My future self will probably be thankful that I won't be in any debt, but sometimes I wish I took a leap of faith even though it would've costed me. You may or may not feel similarly depending on how things go for you. If you really hate Illinois State you can consider transferring to University of Illinois (and maybe get into your major). 

Bonus: look into CLEP exams to test out of some of your gen eds if you want to get ahead."
