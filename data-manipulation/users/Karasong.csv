Thanks for your thoughtful reply i really appreciate it. 

> I know it's not ideal but not all promising relationships begin by following the 100% safe playbook

This isn't about following the playbook. It's about being beyond any doubt that your ""play"" won't end in a disaster. It's not a small thing to be thrown out of your apartment. This is why it's considered a taboo to date your roommates. He thought to himself ""Nah, whatever"", now she has to face the consequences. 

Play the scenario with colleges. If you ask your colleague out and get rejected, what are her restrictions now? Is she allowed to talk to her other colleagues about her love life? Is her bf allowed to pick her up? What if she starts dating another coworker? If you are her boss and would fire her, you are definitely the asshole. If you are her equal coworker and quit your job, I would call that absurd. 

>I had it at least two times with my own roommates and it got resolved pretty reasonably. 

I live in sheared apartments for quite a while now and so do most of my friends. This isn't a thing. You can always bring your guests over. It only becomes a problem if they behave badly or start to practically live there. Only religious places have restrictions like that. 

>The guy doesn't actually sound like a NiceGuy

Not at all, I actually think that lately, most posts on this sub aren't relevant to "" Niceguys"". But I still think that he is an asshole in this situation. He is a terrible landlord who isn't thinking about his actions. He is blindly in love with his tenant and can't see any other solution between breaking Bridges or a ""happy ending"". This is all-or-nothing thinking. 

I dont think that he is a bad person. But he is acting very emotionally to the extent that it is inappropriate for him to live with his tenant. 

I live in a city with extremely high rents. The Housing shortage crisis is so bad that many can not afford to live here. Finding a new place or even moving itself would mean an insane amount of stress and costs for me. 

To deal with this kind of stuff is not acceptable. I go to college and work. I have enough on my plate and I had to deal with this in many different situations. 

>man up and deal with it

This is not what i am saying. I am a girl, swap the genders and it would be the same. Nowadays we dont have sex segregation anymore. You have to be able to have a Platonic relationship with a member of the opposite sex without derailing your or someone else's live and you have to be able to deal with rejection. 

I think that this guy is rather introverted. Taking the girls advice and to start dating is the appropriate solution when your soul is being consumed by lover's grief. Maybe i am going to far here but reading between the lines it sounds to me like this guy could really need a friend in his live."

If you tell her that she would ask you why you are wasting her time. 

You can't apply that logic to any social relationships."
