This is why we need quadriplegic people at the highest levels of the party unless we want inequality and systemic ableism to continue rising.  

Insanity doing the same thing over and over..."

So often my internal excuse, even if I don't vocalise it, is something along the lines of ""I don't feel great right now so I won't fulfil my goal properly. I feel tired so I'll fuck it up. I'm distracted and have too much on my plate so it's better if I leave this task for later when I can really focus on it"" and then it just never ends up getting done.  

Committing to just doing the stuff that I know I should be doing, even on days where I only feel 50% has helped a lot, and I do feel like it's starting to form into a habit of good discipline.  

Edit: and of course committing to bite-size tasks helps too. Just committing to 5 minutes of doing something rather than a half hour is way easier, and very often just the act of starting causes you to fall into a mental state where you want to keep going."
