corgi,fdhlogq,t1_fdhjhds,1578425293.0,"Yes, it has been a wonderful experience, but I don’t think I will put my little corgi through this again. It’s been a good experience because she had a small litter. However, I think she would have more than four puppies next time and I think that would be too much, since she is small for her breed."
corgi,fdgxlgy,t1_fdgwhfh,1578410815.0,"I have several, if you look at my past post you will see one of her puppy pictures."
corgi,fdgpy3o,t1_fdgjpjs,1578405230.0,Doesn’t she! She looks like her mini me
corgi,fdgpvzg,t1_fdgit2o,1578405182.0,I have so many pictures. I had the hardest time trying to figure out which one to post. I’ll post more soon though.
corgi,fdgpsb8,t1_fdgcgoa,1578405100.0,I think everyone needs a corgi in their life. They are just the sweetest dogs.
corgi,fdgpq3a,t1_fdggmvw,1578405048.0,"This was her first litter and everyone is doing well. However, I don’t know how she keeps them fed. If they are awake they are hungry. 

Just yesterday one of them started to open his eyes, and is trying to walk rather than scoot around. It’s adorable."
