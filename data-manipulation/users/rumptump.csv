AskReddit,ffizivx,t3_etu30e,1579986589.0,Ability to enjoy music. I’ve always wanted to be able to listen to music and go to concerts. Looks like a lot of fun but my brain classifies all music as auditory pollution. Its crazy that people not only listen to music but actually feel something positive from it.
LifeProTips,ffiylgv,t1_ffin43q,1579985913.0,"SSN are the only good way to distinguish people. I’m a junior so my dad has the same name, lots of people have the same name and even occasionally the same birthday as well for super common names. Honestly after the Equifax breach, most SSNs are publicly available on the dark net so its not like you are protecting anything of value."

AskReddit,ffht5xp,t1_ffhssfl,1579952609.0,"Guess we will have to consult an anthropologist to see if there is any evidence of hair length variation within the same population in the fossil record. 

Regardless of when the practice emerged, variable hair length allows humans to survive a much wider range of temperatures. If hot then cut hair. If cold then grow hair. That is natural behavior. Styling hair was perhaps originally done simply for fun but out technology has turned it into a drug that harms the mind"

AskReddit,ffhrbwf,t1_ffhq7mu,1579949822.0,"The only sustainable form of self love is to wholly embrace your natural form. Once you decide that a body modification is a preferable form, you have turned away from ever truly loving yourself. You will enter a spiral of increasing modifications until the true you is gone and a demon of self loathing stares back at you in the mirror"
AskReddit,ffhq36g,t1_ffhosqn,1579947880.0,Humans are born wholesome and complete. Our bodies should not be marked and defiled with filthy ink. Learn to love your body for what it is. Modifying it only brings insecurity.
AskReddit,ffhndux,t1_ffhetxx,1579943736.0,Depends on the religion and the social conditions of the time and place. I’m atheist but even I think that religion has been an overwhelming force of good throughout human history. The modern secular welfare state has made most of its functions obsolete but even now churches serve as a powerful form of community in our ever isolating world

explainlikeimfive,ffhl3yj,t1_ffhih2f,1579940354.0,"Anything not killed in the initial blast has a chance of surviving. The smaller and less complicated an organism is, the more likely the species is to survive. More common organisms have more total chances of survival. If you have a trillion bugs scattered across the world, its hard to kill them all at once. 

Also you need to realize that much of the world is not near the nuclear missile targets. Military installations and major population centers would be bombed, but that still leaves the majority of land not hit directly. For example I think only 2% of the USA is human settlement, the rest is a mixture of farms, pasture, and forests. Have you ever driven across the country? The world is a very big place! It takes an entire day just to drive across texas. I’m sure a few bugs will survive a nuclear exchange. The real problem will be the lack of food due to the nuclear winter."

SonyAlpha,ffgjwnu,t1_ffgb8ft,1579907933.0,Very sad to hear about that. The people of BC must hate nature. They are deforesting at an unprecedented rate and they allow uncontrolled dogs to harass the precious wildlife.
SonyAlpha,ffgjqc1,t1_ffgdgzq,1579907818.0,"Interesting. I still think its impossible to maintain the 100% control expectation though. I’m just jaded from so many hikers letting their crappy dogs run wild. Everyone thinks that its not their dog that is the problem, and usually it is."
SonyAlpha,ffgaqlo,t1_ffg9zcg,1579902120.0,"Not sure why it would be any different elsewhere. Offleash dogs are a threat to wildlife and other hikers. Even if you think other people on the trail should suffer from your offleash dogs, you can’t justify the ecological disruption if you take conservation seriously. I know that america invented the concept of conservation of the environment but the rest of the word can’t be that far behind?"
