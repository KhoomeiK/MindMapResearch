Anxiety,fcuaul6,t1_fcuaqhr,1577976674.0,Glad to hear. Guess I’ll try and get back to sleep now.
Anxiety,fcuamdk,t1_fcuaesq,1577976522.0,Yeah and just trying to break that anxiety connection with my bed hey. Are you feeling better atm?
Anxiety,fcu9bdk,t3_eiycto,1577975608.0,Hope you got through it okay. I just woke up at 12:30am with anxiety. Trying to learn to just get up out of bed when it hits and do something helpful before I try to sleep again.
depression,fcqoekh,t1_fcqo9fk,1577889535.0,Can try to give to some words?
depression,fcqnt1s,t1_fcqnkpj,1577889245.0,Yeah already been through 3 myself 😕
depression,fcqnr81,t1_fcqnab4,1577889219.0,Yeah stuff that. I’d bail on the sleep at that point and  have another go tonight personally. But that’s just me
depression,fcqn0ho,t1_fcqmuql,1577888866.0,Yeah I guess that’s what makes depression so lonely
depression,fcqlqn9,t3_eiiddg,1577888235.0,"Go for a walk outside, I did that a couple nights ago at 3am. Didn’t help feel any better, but I fell asleep when I got back 🤷‍♂️"
depression,fcqju1j,t3_eiia12,1577887273.0,"That’s such a good way of putting it. A ghost. I’ve felt like this my whole life, same experience being always on the edge, never really belonging. The expendable friend. I’ve run out of hope tbh. Just trying to find a therapist as a last ditch effort now."
depression,fcqji8s,t3_eiiddg,1577887107.0,Feeling the same.... it doesn’t help much but it’s something: “this too shall pass”
depression,fc4vd3w,t3_eg1ib1,1577429928.0,"Yep. There right now, they tell you that you can always talk to them but it’s not true. They “can’t handle the truth” if I really said it how it was. It’s the most lonely place I’ve ever been in... causing more depression.... causing more loneliness... and on it goes."
lonely,fbijo8c,t1_fbij0jm,1576903037.0,"That’s the question. In short I think it’s a lot of childhood stuff. I actually wrote out my entire family tree recently to try to find an example of a successful healthy relationship. Not a single one. I was raised by two alcoholics, although sober since before I was born, and although they did there best they are emotionally neglectful. My mum has some kind of narcissistic disorder, and continues to abuse pharmaceutical drugs. There has never been any kind of mentoring from my parents with relationships. I have anxiety/depression myself, I’m just afraid of everything around relationships. Can’t talk to anyone new, and if I do it takes a good 6 months of regular contact with them before I’m comfortable enough to be myself. Afraid of the commitment of a relationship, even just of a few dates. “What if the date goes well and I have to go on a 2nd date? Can I keep that up?” “What if I stop liking her years later, how will I ever break up with her?”. The list goes on and on the thoughts I have that paralyse me on this. There’s more I could say but doubt you want my life story... any more than I’ve said.... but these days I’ve lost faith in myself to ever have a relationship because I don’t know if I’ll ever overcome my fucked up brain. If I can’t find a way to cope with that I cannot see any future where I manage a relationship. It sucks, because I would love one. Wbu."
