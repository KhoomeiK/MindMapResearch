my dad's retired now, but I grew up living in a church manse. my mom was the organist for many years and my siblings and I all worked at the church as assistant caretakers at some point during our youths.

that manse was built on top of a site that used to be a cemetery, until they dug it up to move it across town in order to build the manse, and when they were digging out the foundation, they found out they missed a casket. instead of digging it up and moving it, they just pushed it back in and built around it. in the basement you could tell exactly where it was too."
