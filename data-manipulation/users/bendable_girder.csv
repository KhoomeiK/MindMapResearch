If you must violate this principle, increase the number of days to 6 rather than increase the new / day. So you'd be looking at 6 x 100 new / day = 600 new / week."

Compromise.

I used to be a very black/white, right/wrong, with-me-or-against-me sort of person, with the high standards and liberal application of judgement to match. I've mellowed out, and I'm at a point in my life where empathy matters more to me than principle, most of the time. The hills worth dying on are far between; I find an honest exchange of perspectives much more worthwhile. In the words of Vonnegut, ""Goddamit babies, you've got to be kind.""
