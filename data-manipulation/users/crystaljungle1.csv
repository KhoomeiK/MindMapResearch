But if she took plan Plan B you should be fine. The other poster is right; learn how to properly apply a condom. Also birth control pills or an IUD may be a good idea for your girlfriend (in combination with a condom).

Additionally, I don’t know how old the condom was but NEVER keep a condom in your wallet. Your body heat will wear down the material over time and make it more likely to break."

Don’t let a “handicap” define you. President Theodore Roosevelt as a child was kicked out of school because he wasn’t smart enough to keep up and his teacher said he couldn’t be taught. His mother hid the letter from him and told him that he had to stop going because he was smarter than the other children and homeschooled him instead. After she died he was going through her things and found the letter. He said he cried and realized how much that did for him.

However, drugs, even for a non-epileptic can absolutely cause seizures. As can drinking while taking medications. I don’t know what epilepsy medication you take, but I take lamictal and I’m not supposed to drink anything at all with it. Alcohol to excess in itself can also cause seizures. If it was a one time occurrence and you are not planning on doing it again, I don’t know if it’s necessary to report it to your doctor. If you are plan on doing it again, get yourself some help before you get out of control, if not for you but for the sake of your child. You’re a parent; you don’t have the right to indulge in those behaviors now because you have a helpless person completely dependent on you.

At the time I was a decade younger and a bit shy so I didn’t have it in me to tell her I didn’t want to hear it and to leave me alone (especially since we worked in public and I thought she might cause a scene).

Don’t blame yourself for it taking so long to get diagnosed; it took a year for a doctor to actually send me to a neurologist because none of them thought it could possibly be epilepsy because I never lose control of my bladder/bowels when I have a seizure and as soon as I saw a neurologist she knew immediately it was epilepsy. Also, as your child gets older, it will likely lessen as epilepsy is stronger in the developmental years. I would strongly recommend the therapy though, even just a regular therapist to help them cope with bullying and dealing with being different. Good luck!"
