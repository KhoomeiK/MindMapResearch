Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life‚Ä¶ He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful‚Ä¶ the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."

dankchristianmemes,fcabyrb,t1_fc59meq,1577566442.0,"No problem. We are all sinners and the price of sin is death. Eternal death at that. Before Christ, The only way for your sins to be cleaned is through a sacrifice of a pure lamb. We commit so many sins its be impossible to be fully pure all the time. That's why Jesus came into this world, lived a life without sin and sacrificed himself for your sins. He died so you wouldn't have to die. He then defeated death and resurrected. Your sins were paid for in that cross. Salvation is not free but has been paid for you. It is a gift. All you have to do to receive that gift is accept Him as your savior.  

Hope that helps. 

If you're still curious you can always pick up a Chritian Bible or even listen to these guys. They're geared towards YA but hold great info: https://youtu.be/MVlbMlzknzk"
dankchristianmemes,fc4rb1o,t1_fc4qmif,1577425550.0,"Believe that he died on the cross for you and resurrected for you. Literally invite him. Talk to him and say something similar to ""jesus, I'm not sure who you are but I know that I'm not perfect. I believe that you died for me and came back to life. Forgive me for my sins and live in me. Transform my life. Write my name in the book of life"" it's not a ""prayer"" in a scense that the actual words and their arrangement hold their power but rather the meaning you put behind them. If whether you truly believe"
dankchristianmemes,fc4q2lq,t1_fc4prp4,1577424345.0,"Then it's not perfect. It becomes flawed. In a healthy relationship, things are not one sided. We need to put in some sort of effort. Some sort of faith on our partner. It's a a mutual relationship."
dankchristianmemes,fc4pib2,t1_fc4p4x0,1577423810.0,"Mate, just think about it. He doesn't need us to suffer but for some reason we pick suffering over him. We became a proud people that would much rather try to comprehend by our own intellect than by trusting the author of humanity. He is giving us a chance, a chance to pick up all the pieces and come to him. Jesus died to give you a chance. A chance at a life where suffering can be overcome with peace. What are you doing with that chance?"
dankchristianmemes,fc4oltu,t1_fc4ndsb,1577422972.0,"I see the point your trying to make. Let me clarify. We, as humanity, are suffering for own actions. We messed up. God gave us a perfect world which we then turned into what it is today. Those children suffer for the actions of their fathers and mothers and those who came before them. We made life suck but they can be saved at a personal level. 

Not everyone is born in the same conditions. Some people are born in wealth, others like me were born with incurable progressive diseases. Yet, to those who give their heart to God, like I did, he blesses them. He makes the progressive disease stop in its track for 7 years in ways that doctors don't comprehend. He saves at a personal level, not an industrial one. 

I'm not comparing myself to what those poor children face, but  God offers them salvation from the sins of the fathers at an individual level."
dankchristianmemes,fc4nzkc,t1_fc4nmch,1577422405.0,"I see your point but it's just an analogy. The point is would the world really be perfect if someone else chose what you would wear every day? What kind of haircut you should have? Would the world really be perfect if someone made decisions for you? Would live really be love if you force another person into loving you? 

It's a mutual relationship. He gave you free will, what you do with it is up to you.

Accept Jesus into your heart. That's it. No need ti get in your hands and knees sing to an idol or whatever. He already paid for your entrance to heaven. It's his gift for you. He died for you. Will you accept this gift?"
dankchristianmemes,fc4maja,t1_fc4lhsu,1577420891.0,"Mate, I hate to break it to you but your suffering for your own actions. People often blame God or rather question his existence because they fail to see that life sucks because we make it suck.

Do you think God wants you to suffer? Of course not but you're suffering because you live a life that leads to suffering. 

Ok but why is there suffering in the first place if God is all Good?

Well think of it as this. Why are there people with ugly messy hair and huge beards when barbers exist? Simple. They simply don't go to the barber. They instead choose to live their lives like that but if they went to the barber do you think he would deny a haircut or a shave?

In the end, it is really up to you to decide if you'll pass eternity in siffering or in riches. And you don't have to live a perfect life and pray 8 times a day and be the most holy person ever. Nah, man. None of that is necessary. Just one simple action secures your place in heaven."

Yet, he still loves us. No matter what you've done or who you are GOD LOVES YOU. Just wanted for you to know that."
