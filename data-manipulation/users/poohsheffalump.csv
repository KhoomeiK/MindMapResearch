This is the type of argument people make all the time that I've never understood. Partial deterrents are real - if you put extra barriers in place, yes some people won't be deterred (like the person you describe who has actively considered that life in prison is nbd for their crime), but a certain proportion of them will be deterred, and that could make a huge difference. The idea that people thinking about using a gun to kill someone are somehow immune to any deterrent and it's not worth trying is ridiculous."

climbing,few6x2o,t1_fetrsrj,1579406171.0,"yeah, you're correct. In this case it is the actual first ascent though. The pre-hung draws are put up by Dave either on rappel or from the ground up on previous attempts. That's pretty common for harder sport routes, especially overhung routes that would otherwise be very hard to clean on rappel.

For people saying it's 'my first ascent' when its not the true FA, it would be better if they didn't use that term. Instead, it would be better to say it's their 'redpoint' (if the send took multiple tries), a 'flash' (if they sent on their first try but they knew critical details of the climb beforehand/had some beta), or their 'onsight' (if it was the first time they laid eyes on the route and climbed it first go)."

Maybe Trump doesn't order the assassination without the Embassy attack, and the Embassy attack doesn't happen bc of such and such, and that doesn't happen without so and so.

However, I think you might be massively underestimating how difficult it is to map and monitor all brain activity. There are currently no methods to do this except in very simple organisms like c elegans. The problem is even harder since we’d need to monitor an intact brain (through the skull) so any non-transparent species (i.e. anything other than c elegans) cannot benefit from typical high resolution imaging techniques (Calcium or voltage imaging). All non-invasive imaging has laughably poor spatial resolution (fMRI), and isn’t even a direct read of neural activity is but instead a read of changes in blood flow.

And yes, 2-photon microscopes allow us to use longer wavelengths (lower energy) to activate fluorescent molecules. Since the laser is red/infrared, we get way better depth penetration into the brain bc of reduced light scattering, so we can image deeper.
