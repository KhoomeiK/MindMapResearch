unitedkingdom,ffje41g,t1_ffjdlj6,1579996337.0,"In her home country of Zimbabwe, she and her family are are considered brown by the black majority. My father-in-law recalls being told things like ""you're not black, you're not white. What are you? You are nothing."" So it's offensive to her and her family to be called black. And they literally aren't black, they are brown. Ancestors of Europe, Africa and West Asia. But in public if I refer to her as brown, I get stunned and awkward looks. You can see how this gets annoying."

unitedkingdom,ffj5g0r,t1_ffj2tup,1579990870.0,"I think a lot of it comes down to historical ignorance and modern hypersensitivity, and the nature of political correctness, which is inherently inconsistent and contradictory.

It's especially bad in the US, and like it or not American pop culture and subcultures have an enormous impact on the rest of the world."

unitedkingdom,ffixwhh,t1_ffiw1vw,1579985413.0,"In SA today they're usually referred to as ""brown"", which of course is horrifically racist in the UK. In both the UK and the US, anyone with even 1/10th African ancestry is flatly referred to as ""black"". It's politically correct, but only because we're all too stupid and ignorant to understand the racist connotations of that criteria, which go back to the days of slavery when mixed people would be designated ""black"" to keep them as slaves or deprive them of rights."

If I somehow get 10 trillion dollars and buy Star Wars from Disney, and then say ""all Lucas and Disney iterations of Star Wars never happened. Rey is Anakin's grandmother, Luke is a giraffe masquerading as a human using the power of the Force, and Jar Jar was actually Luke's father""... does that make it ""canon""?
