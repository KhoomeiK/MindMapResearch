fatlogic,feihhck,t1_fehhavv,1579138640.0,Yeah when I was a child I could polish off a bag of Doritos pretty quickly so idk what you’re talking about. That was clearly above my calorie needs in addition to the rest of my food for the day.

birthcontrol,fegfltg,t3_eozzsd,1579091115.0,"It’s probably the plan b! Every time I have taken it, it has really messed with my cycle. Also, every time I stress about being pregnant, my cycle comes later. I know it is easier said than done, but you’ve got to stop stressing about it. You can freak yourself out enough that it messes with your period."

Seriously though I do the same thing it’s so annoying."
childfree,fege9vs,t3_eoxu5w,1579089709.0,"Omg I just had this conversation this week. I have one dog with an injured paw and one with a heart condition. “Wow kids are easier than that!” Ummm no. My injured paw dog, just slap a boot on that paw so he can’t lick it, and bonus!!! He can’t bitch about it all day like a human would!! My heart condition dog is blissfully unaware that anything is even wrong with him and literally requires no medication! Just had to switch out the food I feed him which is ~$16 per month. Which he also does not bitch about. Sooooo many less problems than children."

funny,fefzcef,t1_feephq7,1579070427.0,No no the billboard says cosmo is PORN. Which honestly I feel like is a much more difficult discussion to have with your first grader who just learned to read but doesn’t know what the word porn is yet.

funny,fefyrrq,t1_fef4pua,1579069808.0,YES I agree!! I’m not LDS either but there is definitely a weirdness about the state and culture in the best always possible. I don’t want that to go away!!

funny,fefy63k,t1_feexi02,1579069170.0,"Except for the LDS church is literally involved in writing and reforming law in Utah. Like actively and publicly involved.
Edit because I need to make this exceedingly clear: representatives of the LDS church (not just members, representatives of the church’s interests) are involved in writing bills etc. This is publicly advertised in Utah. No church should be able to send representatives to act in its own interest in political proceedings."
excatholic,fefx1b0,t1_fefpmla,1579068010.0,"Ah yes the omnipotent and omniscient all powerful and loving God, in all of his knowledge, created a species knowing full well they would doom themselves and all of their ancestors for the rest of time. THEN even after creating this doomed species, decided the only way for them to be saved was to send himself to earth and sacrifice himself to them, but only hundreds of thousands of years after the original transgression. Oh also he’s not going to TELL you any of this, you just have to figure it out on your own. Oh and if you hear it and don’t believe it right away, you’re going to hell. But god already knew that, because he created you and knew the choices you would make. Therefore created you knowing you would burn in hell for all of eternity. Therefore god is a dick."
