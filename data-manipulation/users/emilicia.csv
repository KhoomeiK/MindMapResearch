This made me feel a bit better, thank you"
AskReddit,fdmpfug,t3_em2vfz,1578559328.0,"My mum didnâ€™t allow us to watch anything that we werenâ€™t old enough for.

For example, if something was rated â€˜12â€™ I could not watch it until I was 12 - not even when I was 11.

Same with ratings of 15, 18 etc. I think they call them R rated in America?

I also wasnâ€™t allowed a drop of alcohol until I turned 18"
AskReddit,fdmp8w1,t3_em2vfz,1578559071.0,"It wasnâ€™t so much of a rule, but when I was living at home it just became the â€˜thingâ€™ to throw our dirty clothes down the stairs to be washed. My mum would pick up the laundry from the bottom of the stairs then take it to the kitchen where the washing machine is

I have no idea why or how this became our ritual for laundry, or why my mum didnâ€™t want us to just bring our clothes down/use a laundry basket lol"
