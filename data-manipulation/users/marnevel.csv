But let's talk actual facts. Because the entire argument rests on some pretty straight-forward facts.

Fact 1: [we have 10 years left of business-as-usual fossil fuel consumption before we trigger a runaway greenhouse effect, ending society as we know it.](https://ipcc.ch/sr15) We can spend time hypothesizing about what this kind of collapse looks like, but it's not pretty, there are no guaranteed winners, and it looks especially bleak for Canada in particular.

Fact 2: This pipeline costs [$10B](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/liberals-approve-12b-trans-mountain-expansion-project-offering-some-relief-to-oil-rich-provinces) to build, and brings in [$500m](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tmx-pipeline-morneau-1.5333261) per year if it runs at capacity. Running at capacity almost certainly means ""business-as-usual fossil fuel consumption."" That's 20 years of operation -- 20 years of business-as-usual fossil fuel consumption on this planet -- to even recoup that investment. 

So please, help me reconcile that. 10 years of business as usual fossil fuel burning = my country is likely destroyed by geopolitical upheaval within my lifetime. And 20 years of business as usual before we even make back our investment. Not to mention all the wasted time and effort."
CanadaPolitics,feva4e9,t1_feuwhd3,1579394986.0,"Here's the problem with ""the money gets reinvested:""

For your calculations to work out, you don't just need to still be using oil in 20 years. You literally need to have *made zero progress away from fossil fuels* in that time frame.

Because if we're burning less -- then this pipeline won't be running at capacity.

And if we're not burning less? [We have 10 years left at the rate we're burning.](https://ipcc.ch/sr15) If your economic calculation involves business-as-usual fossil fuel use for the next 20 years, then either your calculation is wrong, or our society has no future."

[If you switch to the jet stream view](https://www.ventusky.com/?p=47.8;-106.2;4&l=wind-500hpa) you can see that warm Pacific air is coming north to push the polar vortex away.

This ""meandering"" of the jet stream is actually a *consequence* of global warming -- it used to be a strong, steady flow across the continent, a heat engine driven by a combination of the earth's rotation and large temperature difference between the equator and the poles. In turn, the fast-moving high-altitude air acts as a barrier, preventing the flow of cold arctic air down into the temperate latitudes. If your location is north of the jet stream, you get arctic air -- if you're south, you don't. And if the jet stream is strong, it flows straight. But if it's weak, because the temperature differential between the equator and poles is less? The arctic air is better at pushing it aside, and you get a polar vortex sitting over your city for a week or a month.

Shit, even neural networks work like this. You (using calculus) calculate the contribution of each decision to the total overall error.

You ask a question, you give some potential answers, you investigate those answers, you then use those answers to ask deeper questions. Here's what that looks like:

Why did the plane crash? Missile strike.

Why was a missile launched? Plane looked like a hostile target.

Why did the plane look like a hostile target?

1. The plane appeared as a radar blip heading an unexpected direction.
2. The military was on a hair-trigger high alert stance expecting a retaliation from a rocket strike.
3. The plane had a malfunctioning transponder.

Provided all three of those hypothetical answers are true, you can dig deeper:

Why did the plane appear as a radar blip in an unexpected direction? 

1. Because AA radar is imperfect. It cannot detect much below 5000 ft, nor can it detect stealth aircraft -- except when the stealth aircraft changes direction or shape. A plane reaching 5000 ft and suddenly appearing on radar looks a lot like a stealth plane opening its weapon doors and suddenly appearing on radar.

2. Because someone let a passenger plane take off in a war zone.

Why was the military on a hair trigger alert stance? Because Iran had recently fired rockets at US bases in Iraq and was expecting an escalating military response.

And why did Iran fire rockets at US bases? Retaliation for a recent assassination of a top Iranian military official. 


And you go down the fault tree until you figure out ways to make effective interventions in the system to prevent problems from recurring.

So to the people who think it's Iran's fault: you're right. It is. They launched the missile.

And to the people who think it's America's fault: you're also right. It is. They triggered the crisis.

To the people who blame air traffic control? You're right. They let the plane take off.

And to the people who think it's the aircraft maintenance personnel's fault? It might be theirs too, if the transponder really was malfunctioning.

But trying to lay fault in binary? That's just fucking stupid. If you think this plane would have been shot down without the assassination -- that's just not reasonable. If you think this plane would have been shot down even if Iran hadn't fired rockets? That's just unreasonable. There's plenty of blame to go around. And now more than fifty of my countrymen -- four from my city, and two who work at the same place I do -- are dead."

Wildfires have always existed, but were always contained by weather patterns. On long-term scales as weather patterns shifted, larger fires would occur. What we're seeing now is absolutely the normal, expected response for a weather pattern shift -- larger fires, and potentially new species taking over if resulting weather pattern means the old ones burn too readily before being able to reproduce.

Unfortunately for us humans living right now, this natural process releases *a shit ton* of extra carbon dioxide at a time when we know we only have a limited amount left that the atmosphere can absorb, before the rate of weather pattern shifting becomes *so rapid* that human society, and possible even humanity in general, just can't adapt."

Vladmir Putin's primary long-term geopolitical goal -- literally the one goal he's been working towards for twenty years in power -- is for Russian access to convenient all-weather ocean ports. From Russia's perspective, all of their country's history has existed at the whim of foreign powers who can enforce blockades at any time. It's the same fight they've been having since the time of Peter the Great. It's the Great Game again. 


Vladivostok is six thousand kilometers from Moscow. Arkhangelsk freezes. Murmansk is on the Arctic Ocean far from commercial sea lanes. Rostov is fifty kilometers inland up a shallow river estuary (so he took Sevastopol) but both require traversing territorial waters of multiple nations. Same with St. Petersburg. 

There's a reason the primary flow of WWII supplies to Russia went through Iran -- it's the closest ocean port to the Russian heartland. And there's no third-party territorial waters between Iran and the world's oceans.

So what happens once an American leader with a short attention span destabilizes Iran and takes out its leadership? Some lip service about bringing democracy into the region, and a quick withdrawal of US forces to placate a war-weary public. But there won't be a power vacuum -- instead, in comes Russia to ""help rebuild.""  In Putin's eyes, replacing the Guardian Council with a Russia-friendly government is the culmination of his twenty-year struggle to get Russia out from under the thumb of the West."
ABoringDystopia,fcz5nao,t1_fcz3rkq,1578094161.0,"OK, /u/BleedingHeartNazi. There are lots of people of Boomer age who aren't belting pro-segregationist southern rock anthems at karaoke night. I don't think I made that argument, but I'm glad to clarify it for you. Shit, Boomers invented disco culture too. (The gay and black boomers, but still.)

I'm also sure there were some teenagers (the 14 and older group) participating in the hippie movement. But they weren't leading it. And they weren't the primary members of the movement -- not in the Summer of Love, when again, only three years of Boomers were even adults, nor in 1968, nor in 1969. Your argument is what, exactly -- that because a few boomers were adults in the late 60's, the hippie movement belonged to them?

No, it's quite evident based on the examples I gave that *all* the leaders and influencers of the hippie movement belonged to the prior two generations. Boomers *consumed* 60's culture, sure... but they didn't *create* popular culture until with punk, disco, and 70's classic rock. Very distinctly *anti*-hippie music movements. And their influence in electoral politics began being felt, at the earliest, with Carter, and didn't reach ascendancy until they elected Reagan. (In 1980, the youngest Boomers still didn't even have the right to vote.) Though an argument could be made that actually the 26th amendment was the first political victory of the Boomer generation... or was it, too, [fueled by Silent Generation activism?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_a_Democratic_Society)"
dataisbeautiful,fcyqzwk,t1_fcyng5b,1578085274.0,"It's not always clear to tell how people draw distinctions in carbon emissions -- but the numbers I'm using are based off a [37.1 billion tons per year](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07666-6) of industrial emissions (note that total emissions, including deforestation, is 41.5 billion tons). Looks like the clock is using a rate of about 39.7 billion tons per year in their countdown and a total carbon budget of 2.9 trillion tons since 1870. 

The calculations are complex: not all emissions stay in the atmosphere and contribute to warming. Some result in increased biomass, some get absorbed into the ocean (acidifying it, which is a whole other problem) -- but the [Global Carbon Project](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/19/files/GCP_CarbonBudget_2019.pdf) seems to have done the work to determine what rate of emissions results in the required increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide to increase global temperature by 2 degrees, even after considering all these changes. It's also worth noting (slide 43) that the calculation assumes constant CO2 emissions due to ""land use changes"" -- fires are included under this heading -- so any particularly catastrophic fire year that pushes emissions above the average annual 4 gigatons of carbon will decrease the amount remaining in the fossil fuel budget.

Also worth considering is forest regrowth. But with a forest taking a hundred years to reach maturity, we still have that extra carbon in the atmosphere for a hundred years. At this exact moment of time, when we only have 17 years left. (Assuming linear forest growth, we can expect 83% of the carbon from this fire to still be in the atmosphere when we exhaust our carbon budget.)"

Worth noting that Australia's peak fire season is usually *February*. This is just the beginning. Worth noting that this fire season alone [had, by Dec 24, released the equivalent of half of Australia's annual intentional carbon emissions.](https://time.com/5754990/australia-carbon-emissions-fires/) That's 1% of total annual human emissions. By now, after two more weeks of the heaviest burning yet, I estimate it's nearing [0.1% of our entire remaining global carbon budget.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2017/jan/19/carbon-countdown-clock-how-much-of-the-worlds-carbon-budget-have-we-spent)
