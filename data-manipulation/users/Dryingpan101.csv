MonsterHunter,fejmx60,t1_fejmmo9,1579180271.0,But I cant upgrade the armor skills unless I slot in decos yeah? So if my greaves give +2 bombardier no matter how much I upgrade them they'll always be just +2
MonsterHunter,fejme0y,t1_fejmau5,1579179778.0,That was a problem when I was going through GU as well. I saw that alot and trying to explain it to them and some people got it and some just couldnt understand you had to plan out skill points lol
MonsterHunter,fejl379,t1_fejl0qq,1579178532.0,With the maps just learning how to traverse them is a pain
MonsterHunter,fejl18c,t1_fejkub7,1579178477.0,"No I just mean like the map size and how to traverse it. In the past most maps have been on pretty flat ground so it made traversing the map pretty easy it's just finding what paths get me where is the hard part. 

And I mean how now it's just like flat skill buffs and not skill points like the last games so Its taking me some time to adjust, like how a chest piece will just give you expert and not like expert +5 towards critical eye
