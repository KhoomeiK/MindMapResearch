CFB,fgn7uf6,t1_fglrerb,1580939336.0,"I never said they had an obligation. My point is also not that Blackwell is this saint who should hailed and protected.

My point is that MSU obviously did *not* handle the investigation correctly and they are covering their tracks. Blackwell was just in the middle of it. 


The reason his lawyer leaked the deposition to the press, is because the judge refuses to unseal anyone but blackwell's. 

The media and MSU alumni have been attack blackwell from the beginning, regardless of what proof they had of either side. 

My point is that everything that I learned from following this, is that nothing at all has been reported in the media or in the very few excerpts of depositions, that prove your all too personal claim of blackwell being ""scum"".

Like dude, your university just spent 10+ years covering up the systematic rape and molestation by a pedophile, and *those* were the people in charge of *this* investigation!

And you're telling me that, nothing *at all* in my previous comment, gives you a single shred of doubt that MSU didn't do anything wrong along the way? 

Give me a break. 

Literally EVERYONE in charge of the investigation for this, is either currently *charged* or CONVICTED for LYING IN INVESTIGATIONS or OBSTRUCTING INVESTIGATIONS.

But you're saying, even though they arrested Blackwell before any of them AND never charged him with a crime(!!!), *He's* the one who is ""scum"" and guilty? 

If you think MSU hadn't already tried to settle btw, you're joking. 

Again, even in cases of scumbag lawyers doing illegal things, I've *never* seen defendents make a motion for that high of consequences for the prosecution's lawyer unless it's just a way to scare them into dropping the suit. 

I know we all want our universities to have integrity, especially as alumnus. The truth is that, almost every D1 university has some type of disgusting shit like this happening. 

I know Auburn does for sure. Our softball coach hired his son and then let him sleep with several players. Then covered it up when compliance started looking into it. 

Every university in America, has a disturbingly high amount of unreported rape, because thats how these institutions ran things for a majority of their history. 

Only now are we learning and forcing change, but that doesn't mean it all just went away in a flash. 

I guess my point is not so much that I think Blackwell is 100% innocent, but that MSU is very obviously hiding whatever happened in this investigation. They are trying to stop the bleeding, but this isn't how you do fix the wound. 

Dantonio  *resigned* for a reason. If more doesn't come to light about him, I will happily eat crow from you, but until then. 

We *have* to get more information about the police reports and investigations. 

I wasn't just putting ""blackwells word"" over anyone elses. I was literally using Dantonio's statements, MSU PD's statements, and MSU's statements. I even read an entire deposition of one of the detectives.

Lou Anna K. Simon, the former president of Michigan State University, was charged with two felonies, accused of lying to the police about her knowledge of sexual abuse committed by Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar.

Steve Penny, the former chief executive of U.S.A. Gymnastics, was indicted by a Texas grand jury on charges that he tampered with evidence relating to abuse by Dr. Nassar.

Kathie Klages, a former Michigan State gymnastics coach, was charged with lying to the authorities about her knowledge of Dr. Nassar’s crimes.

Dr. William D. Strampel, Dr. Nassar’s boss at Michigan State, was charged with committing sexual misconduct himself."
CFB,fgl48ra,t1_fgjo7su,1580881513.0,"Im sorry man, but if you looked into this case at all. You would see how fucking sketchy MSU PD and MSU's Law Firm treated Blackwell in the investigation into those 3 former players' sexual assault cases.

Seriously, They suspended him, said it was related to ""serious and troubling accusations"" right after he said no to interview with MSU's law firm. 

He said no because a long time MSU Trustee told Blackwell to be careful because he was worried with how the police are handling the investigation. 

Then days later, the MSU PD arrested him for obstructing. Yet, when he refused to answer their questioning, they released him then never charged him.

The days later, MSU's Law Firm finished their report. How funny, *No Wrongdoing by anyone in MSU* Except Blackwell. That Report has never been released besides a summary they released themselves.

He was suspended for 4 more months. Then fired for ""philosophy differences"" said Dantonio. Then later he said that the ""Satellite Camp Ban"" was the reason and Blackwell wasn't as effective with the ban in place. Yet the prior 4 years of employment, he received a raise each year.

Plus praise from Dantonio *each year*. 

Then in the depositions for this case, of MSU's Former President, AD, 2 Detectives that Arrested Blackwell, and Dantonio, none have had their transcriptions released except small excerpts from a couple. The rest were sealed by the judge.

One of the detectives' depos has the most released out of any's. You find out in it, that MSU's Law Firm and MSU PD were directly comparing the police report to their internal report. 

The Detectives also note how the President and the AD were involved a good bit. Every time in depo that the Detective was asked if The President or The AD or MSU's Law Firm ever specifically focused on Blackwell in their meetings, the PD's lawyer objected to the question. The ones he didn't object to, the detective said he could not recall. Despite answer yes or no on tons of questions regarding things from the same exact time period. 

So one minute, they say his suspended for ""serious allegations"" basically 25 days after the sexual assault by 3 former players happened/investigation begun.

Then it has nothing to do with his suspension or firing. In fact it has to do with his ""philosophies"" for coaching. Even though Blackwell had a untarnished record with no complaints and lots of praise from Dantonio. 

Dantonio also said that the differing philosophies provided ""friction"" that wasn't good for the staff. 

Meanwhile, reports have come out how Dantonio overruled recruiting staff objectives to signing Auston Robertson. Who is now in jail for felony assault, and had 4 different incidents of sexual and non sexual assault charges that were dropped or lowered from age 11 to 18, before he was even in college. 

Apparently, Dantonio's sealed depo has him getting pretty hostile during questions. Especially regarding Auston Robertson and the 3 former players that later pled down in court. 

Now, Blackwell probably isn't this perfect angel considering he was a recruiting administrator, but something is being hidden here by MSU. 

I don't get how so many MSU fans here can defend their fucking institution after this bullshit. 

Lets take a look at who was there when all of this happened. 

Lou Anna K. Simon, the former president of Michigan State University, was charged with two felonies, accused of lying to the police about her knowledge of sexual abuse committed by Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar.

Steve Penny, the former chief executive of U.S.A. Gymnastics, was indicted by a Texas grand jury on charges that he tampered with evidence relating to abuse by Dr. Nassar. 

Kathie Klages, a former Michigan State gymnastics coach, was charged with lying to the authorities about her knowledge of Dr. Nassar’s crimes. 

Dr. William D. Strampel, Dr. Nassar’s boss at Michigan State, was charged with committing sexual misconduct himself."
CFB,fgl1u14,t1_fgjv9lk,1580879407.0,"Lol stop. You obviously *arent* biased at all. Like give me a break. How they treated Blackwell was sketchy as fuck. 

Look at this

>Blackwell continues to say he was made the ""fall guy"" following the 2017 on-campus party. **MSU Police arrested and accused Blackwell of obstructing the investigation. He was released and never charged after saying to no to answering the PD's questions.** MSU PD's Investigation included more than 100 witness interviews and eventually led to pled-down convictions and removal from the team for the three football players. **The Jones Day law firm, hired to investigate MSU's handling of the allegations, also accused Blackwell of wrongdoing**. **Blackwell never spoke with Jones Day, and was never charged.** Blackwell has said Michigan State was eager to make a big public statement regarding sexual misconduct under the cloud of the Nassar scandal.

But what makes this look so much like he was chosen to be the fall guy, is that 
>Blackwell received a raise every year, from $80,000 when he got the job, to $129,000 plus a 10% bonus when he re-upped in 2016.

[>Dantonio hasn’t been one for letting staff members go. Only one previous coach has ever not been retained by Dantonio during his 13 years at Michigan State: Ted Gill, a defensive line coach whose last season was 2012. Blackwell, as director of college advancement and performance, was the other rare staff member let go.](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/college/michigan-state-university/2020/01/12/curtis-blackwell-lawsuit-insights-michigan-state-university-mark-dantonio-recruiting/2735687001/)
Then after he was suspended. Then Arrested. Then released. Jones Day Law Firm released *their* report, *also* accusing Blackwell of wrong doing... 

Right before he was arrested by police, he had refused to interview with Jones Day since they had all the interviews and reports from the original police investigation. Neither Jones Day Law, or MSU PD have released their police reports. 

Then, he was finally let go in May of 2017(Suspended for 4 months) and Dantonio even talked about why he was let go. 

>[Blackwell worked at MSU from 2013 until May 2017, when his contract wasn't renewed for what Dantonio called ""philosophical differences."" Dantonio, while on a train in Italy, called Blackwell to let him know he wasn't being retained. Dantonio, in his deposition, cited ""friction"" between Blackwell and the rest of the football department; said NCAA rules had changed regarding camps, which limited Blackwell's effectiveness; and said he had an opportunity to hire longtime NFL executive Sheldon White, who was more than capable of filling Blackwell's responsibilities.](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/college/michigan-state-university/2020/02/04/blackwell-lawyers-detail-allegations-msus-mark-dantonio-committed-multiple-ncaa-violations/4655797002/)


The depositions of Dantonio(released but most redacted), the two detectives that arrested then didn't charge Blackwell, the now former Athletic Director, and President, all have been sealed. 


Blackwell's deposition is the only one allowed to be public. Blackwell's lawyer released one deposition violating the Judge's order in an effort to reveal what was being sealed. Some reporters have copies but they aren't in the open. You might be able to find it online. 

Now, Dantonio's lawyers are motioning to have the case thrown out, Blackwell's lawyers fined and also suspended from practicing law. Which only is motioned when you are trying to scare someone into dropping a suit. Usually done by a much bigger and expensive firm towards a smaller firm/lawyer that can't afford to fight that many appeals.

Also there's this little curious thing

>Blackwell, who is black, said in the early days of his suspension in 2019, he met with longtime trustee Joel Ferguson, and that Ferguson warned him he would be made the fall guy because he is black. Ferguson vehemently disputes saying that.
“That's such bull----, it’s outrageous,"" Ferguson told The News. “I can’t believe he would say that.”

>**Ferguson did say he was concerned with how the MSU Police handled the arrest of Blackwell, saying the police were “a little bit out of order.”**

Sounds like Blackwell used some hyperbole about what Ferguson said, but the sentiment seems to have been the same..."

There's been A LOT of SW movies/shows now, and every single movie is directed by men, and the shows barely had any women directors until more recently. 

Just because they started hiring more women now, doesn't mean they aren't just looking for the best for the job.

And despite how some people online would like to pretend, there hasn't been some mass exodus of white men in America. They didn't get fired just for being white, they didn't not get hired just for being white, they didn't get arrested just for being white. 

So those who come from a time before the current progress, are almost all the people who are still in power or have seniority in pretty much every industry in America.

Well, we have made a lot of social progress pretty quickly believe it or not. As you can see with Harvey Weinstein, who was celebrated and at the most important tables at every Award show just as recent as **2017** Award Season. 

And if you think he's the only one who was that bad, you're kidding yourself. If you also think there aren't bad people in powerful positions like him in **every** job sector or industry in America, you're *still* kidding yourself. 


White men have just been in power for as long as we've had civilizations. 

So naturally, people in power tend to abuse power, but because America always has given the most power to white men... It's only statistically likely that a majority of the people who are abusing their power, are white men. Because to abuse power, means you have to have it in the first place.

So going out of your way to look for women who are talented, hardworking, and good at what they do, is not sexism against men. 

The same reason it's not racist to go out of your way to look for a person of color who meets the qualifications, and hire them. Because you aren't looking at applications and going ""Im not hiring THESE PEOPLE because white people are criminals and lesser human beings"". Because thats what racism is, it's deciding people are lesser human beings therefore don't deserve to be looked at with respect.

That's not what is happening when someone like KK goes out of her way to hire a female director. She's doing that because for 200 years this country has thought they weren't worthy or able to have jobs that the white men have. She's decided that stops with her, because she knows that there are women out there who can do the job just as well and probably a lot who can do things better.

Goddamn, it's like y'all want to be labeled as neckbeards. Why does it piss you off so much if she DID say they were looking specifically for a woman director? 

With the current infrastructure, even though there's been some big name movies with women directing them, the inequality has barely changed.

I know, how dare they make an effort to give chances to creatives and hard working people who in the past would never get. 

Saying they want to hire more women or give more time to women characters, isn't about you. Trust me.

They aren't thinking, ""haha fuck those white men! Im gonna replace them all with women!!"". They're thinking, ""There's so many talented and creative women who have not gotten the chances they deserve. I hope I can give them those chances.""

I don't get what is so goddamn hard to grasp about that? 

Also, you replied to them saying ""this was about directors, not story""... What do you think the director does? They storyboard, they film, they design, they edit the movies. They also tend to cast movies. 

This gives them a chance to make a film with women characters that they would understand much deeper than most men would be able to. Again, nothing hostile about it.

Again, everyone in this thread is just so salty and playing dumb as if this inequality *doesnt* exist. 

It's only natural for the comment you replied to, to also describe about the benefits besides giving someone a chance.

Purely bc of the perspective and ability to relate/understand them better due to being a woman.

Did you write a strongly worded letter to the NFL after Janet Jackson's boob popped out?

The only thing that makes this ""fucked up"" is that people like you demonize sex and women's bodies so much that you actually make kids ten times more curious in it. Making it ten times more likely they will be obsessed with it or be absolutely inept in social activities in the future when they are old enough to experience them. 

How do people seriously think like this after EVERYTHING we know at this point. Not to mention how you're in this subreddit, literally fetishizing these women while you're also disavowing them and their character. 

God help any kids that you might have. Because if your post is anything to go off, they'll grow up with either a fear of sex, thus being unable to see women as anything else. Or they'll never tell you the truth/respect your rules."

Here's a list and mini rant about stuff that didn't get recognize at the Oscars 



>**The Farewell:** Best Film | Awkwafina - Best Actress | Lulu Wang - Best Director | Best Original Screenplay

>**The Last Black Man in San Francisco:** Best Film | Joe Talbot - Best Director 

>**Clemency:** Alfre Woodard - Best Actress

>**Apollo 11** 

>**They Shall Not Grow Old:** Best Film | Peter Jackson - Best Director 

Greta Gerwig should have had a Director nom at least, too imo.


Awkwafina not even being NOMINATED seriously makes me dislike the Oscars more than I ever have. They do not give a fuck about what movie is good. If you don't schmooze the voters at their events, you will be forgotten. 

The Actress Noms are honestly the worst in a while. Its like they watched 5 movies only.

The Irishman having 10 and Joker having 11(!) is a joke 

Marty, Todd Phillips, and Joaquin 100% campaigned their asses off this year and it worked like a charm. 

Half their Noms make no sense at all:

**The Irishman:** Best Director | Best Editing(LOL) | Visual Effects | 

**Joker:** Best Mixing | Best Directing | Best Adapted Screenplay | Original Score



Joaquin is obviously gonna win Best Actor, that's fine, cool. But what in the hell is Todd Phillips AND Scorcese doing on the Best Directors lists? 

Lulu Wang and Greta Gerwig not even being nominated basically shows that since they didn't kiss the voter's asses, the majority probably didn't even think of them lol..."

gifs,fgevmny,t1_fg6713n,1580711722.0,"3 states decided the election. Those 3 states were Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. You need 270 Votes from states to win. 

At one point of the night, they were basically tied and needed like 50 Electoral votes to win. So they needed to win 3 states worth that many. 

Trump won them, thus taking the white house. What people don't know is how close it was.

He won Michigan(16 EC) by 0.2%, Pennsylvania(20 EC) by 0.8%, and Wisconsin(10 EC) by 0.8%.

Which was 15k total votes in Michigan and Pennsylvania. She lost Wisconsin only by 2k votes.

Here is the kicker and why it doesn't always matter that *most* people in America would never vote for Trump. 

PRIOR to the 2016 Election, every one of those states had a Republican Gov. Each of those states created rules at the last second, that unregistered OVER 100k in both Penn and Mich.

In Wisconsin, where she only lost by 2k, they unregistered OVER 1 MILLION VOTERS. They usually do it after the deadline for registering is past.

This is how Republicans cheat and scam their way to winning. Otherwise every year, truthfully, Democrats would win. They aren't willing to abuse the government that way though. They basically suck at fighting fire. A good way to put it, is that they tried to fight fire with water(the way you're supposed to) but nothing comes out of the hose because the Republicans wrote a law that cuts off the water every time a fire happens.


You should look up some exposé on Gov. Kemp in Georgia. He was Sect of State when he ran in 2018, that position is the one that literally runs the elections. He beat the democrat by like 8k votes, well Kemp took over 100k black voters off registration AFTER the deadline to register passed. 

He literally openly talked about ""If too many minorities vote, the democrats will win. We can't let that happen"". This is what progressive people are talking about when we say Racism is just as alive as ever. 

It's because the infrastructure put in place(Pre-Civil Rights Act) to fuck over black people, IS STILL IN PLACE."

Yet at the same time, they wish they could put you in jail for not ""respecting"" a flag or even the stupidass national anthem.
