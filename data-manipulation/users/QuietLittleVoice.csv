this is what made me think that the only reason it was 'impossible' in my view to have a world where less animals are farmed for our meat is because of people like me who are 'dug in' and see it as the norm, but perhaps its time to start seeing what its like on the other side of the fence instead of defending life-long views that crumbled in a matter of hours ""just because"" :)"

todayilearned,ffgl9lt,t1_ffgeo6t,1579908842.0,"I see your point about having an alternative to fall back on but realistically its not an option, how would you go about convincing 8 billion people to put the bacon down forever? its just not realistic, humans are dicks and that pig is also a dick that will still eat you if the berry bush is further away and it is starving but as you said this isn't sole justification to eat them.

im not saying we should go out of our way to slaughter animals but if it is inevitable that humans are going to eat meat is it not our duty to try and safely provide it in a way that doesn't cause suffering to the animal?

I get the point about animals feeling pain but its kinda irrelevant because we're not talking about pig fighting or kicking cats, we're talking about farms like the one in the article, free-range fields in the Wiltshire countryside, not battery farms so there is no suffering or pain, they live a full life and are knocked unconscious and slaughtered in a matter of seconds, they don't even know it happens, and i know this is a super credible source but my very first job was on a free range farm in wales so I've experienced this first hand.

but I agree, you are right in that regard and there is no argument against the fact that animals feel physical pain, but emotional distress is on a animal by animal basis, for example a honeybadger feels pain but as we all know, honeybadgers don't give a fuck, but we are not eating honeybadgers which is why I wish free range natural farms where farm animals grow up in peace and are 'humanely killed' (as ironic as that is) were the norm.

"" The whataboutism was when you were like ""Like you are?"" That is literally whataboutism, no need to deny it.""

yeah, you right, my b.

if it seems like im kinda all over the place its because you and your fiancee have given me quite a bit to reflect on about when it comes to my views and experiences with animal farming and i'm not too sure i still hold the views I did a few hours ago."
todayilearned,ffggpb8,t1_ffgcvo0,1579905837.0,"we're arguing two points here and we're mixing the two together.

how can you humanely kill that which does not want to die?

You can't, plain and simple, but you can make it easier for them, the point im trying to make is that humans will be eating meat until the earth spins into the sun and humanity is forgotten to the universe, a 100% vegan planet would be amazing and something I would advocate for, if it were a possibility, but its a fantasy. people eat meat. you can't outright ban the consumption of meat and if you could people would still poach.

and how does a wild farm animal's life usually end in the wild, being ripped apart while still alive to feed a predator, so if its natural and a part of nature, something that despite our best efforts to distance ourselves, we are still a part of ,why is it less cruel to safely and humanely farm them? and why is it somehow not okay for us to do it when we can and should do it gently?

Battery farms are a completely different box of frogs, they should all be levelled and the owners shot to death with bb guns, im talking about free-range farming, is it not kinder to raise gently and slaughter for a purpose, rather than battery farm or have it fend for itself then get chewed apart by a wolf or something?

and more often than not in farming, things like lamb excluded, animals are slaughtered once they have passed on their genes and matured because the meat of a mature animal is far better.

"" And yes, I pointed out the comparison of how by your own logic that ""Breeding something with a purpose"" would also imply that breeding humans for the purpose of slavery would then be fine as well. I'm pointing out logical inconsistency, because clearly you do not think that's fine, so then why is it okay when done to non-human animals?""

and that is why i called you an idiot, if you can't make the distinction between why raising and slaughtering a farm animal is okay and why doing the same to a human is not, then whats the point of arguing with you about it because if you haven't come to that conclusion on your own by now then I sure as hell aren't going to be able to get you there.

besides its not like its a one way relationship animals like alligators and tigers are smart enough to study human patterns for weeks to see when the best time to consistently hunt people over and over is, kinda like farming us.... do we tell them that its wrong? no because its in their nature as it is in ours. humans are fucking animals ourselves and to pretend we aren't and that we shouldn't eat meat because we're just better than that is ridiculous."
todayilearned,ffgbnif,t1_ffg64pp,1579902678.0,"real quick i came out the gate hot at you and it was completely unnecessary, sorry.

I really didn't use fallacies as much as you think I did. a fallacy is invalid reasoning to build an argument, a wild pig WILL eat you, animals ARE NOT as intelligent as humans and can't experience the depth of emotions we can these are VALID facts backed up by decades of scienctific research, just because i used scenarios to convey them doesn't make them fallacies.

I made a wild assumption but the points are still valid, its not like i based my argument on that assumption, it was just a sidenote and i never used whataboutism once.

I don't really see why you chimed in to be honest other than you and her seem to frequent similar subreddits, if you jumped in to defend a friend thats cool but at least argue the point, not the wording of the statement."
todayilearned,ffgah19,t1_ffg1a0l,1579901957.0,"I agree with everything you are saying, personally my first job was on a free range farm here in the welsh countryside so I have no experience with battery farming, I've never had to see a pig scream in Co2 chamber because it was usually knocked out then killed while it was unconscious which is a far more peaceful way to go so that where im coming from when I mention humane killing.

but I feel like we've lost track a bit, i agree that as humans we should treat animals better hence why im backing the humane slaughter side of this,

but the point that you stated is that by animal farming logic it would also be fine if we bred people to be slaves, or food for that matter. those were your exact words, why i called you an idiot and why i compared how wild animals and humans think because as you also said ""Something being comparable does not mean it is equal""

""I don't view non-human animals as 'people' in the same way I view humans as people I simply believe that because they are suffering as a direct result of our actions, we ought to recognize that their suffering is not 'nothing'""

todayilearned,fffy6uw,t1_fffvfy4,1579894383.0,"I just want to preface this by saying that calling you an idiot set the wrong tone, im not trying to argue I am genuinely interested in your viewpoint and mainly what makes you think that a pig can be remotely comparable to a human. so im sorry for being a dick but i called you an idiot because you think you can 'logically' apply the two scenarios when you can't they are so different it's blinding.

&#x200B;

Its no secret that animals are intelligent, but they are vastly less intelligent that humans, the same with their ability to process emotion, its like saying my jack russel is comparable to a cheetah because they have similar builds and i've seen my dog run fast after a ball, but obviously there are loads of underlying factors.

mainly, nature. the only thing stopping a pig from growing up with an appetite for human is its removal from its natural world. call that cruel all you want but raising an animal in comfort to be quickly slaughtered for a purpose is not comparable even in the slightest to the effect that the same scenario would have on a human's psyche. animals just aren't intelligent enough to see things the way we do.

also im going to make a pretty wild assumption based on your views in your post and assume you probably have the mentality that 'animals are people too' quite frankly, no. they aren't. we like to think they are because we grew up watching Bambi or Thunder-cats or some shit that humanises animals but they just aren't, we're too different.

A wild pig for example has not got the critical thinking skills to think ""This man is friendly, i'll give him a pass"" no a wild pig will charge and gore you the moment you let your guard down, again that's nature, predators and prey. cruelty isn't a factor to them because they have no concept of it. meanwhile we obviously do.

(and by the way there is nothing cruel about the process of farming animals for meat, its the most humane way that we can acquire meat, why do think we've been doing it for so long without trying another method, because it works out best for everything involved)

so to me you come across as an idiot because you see the perfectly normal, humane way of raising farm animals in comfort and safety for human consumption as comparable to slavery and you even jumped as far as cannibalism. 

they do not have these concepts, they feel basic emotions like grief but they aren't sitting there like an Auschwitz prisoner wondering if today is their last like in chicken run.
