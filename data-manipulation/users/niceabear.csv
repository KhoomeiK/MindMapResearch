zelda,ffcvham,t3_esrf0t,1579808107.0,Omg.  So cool
AskReddit,ffcaa37,t1_ffbv1k1,1579795092.0,Ha ha.  Spot on.  It’s frustrating when people don’t value your time as well as your talent.
worldnews,ffbi8cr,t3_esk5bn,1579766500.0,"Red Cross was amazing when we had our wildfire evacuation in BC. They stuck around for quite awhile, offered special cleaning supplies for people’s homes ( retardant stains etc) offered financial assistance and more. They also followed up even further down the road."
YouShouldKnow,ff8cyim,t3_erx82t,1579673383.0,Can confirm. We have a lot of lime scale here.  I hired a guy to replace an element in our heater.... there was so much sediment he couldn’t get the element out.  I bet there was six inches of sediment in there.  Heavy as hell to get out of the basement
Cakes,ff37730,t3_era088,1579535323.0,Thank you!
Cakes,ff359hy,t3_era088,1579533996.0,As thank you that’s kind.  The hat and hand are just poster board I drew on and cut out. The face is piped chocolate I cooled and transferred on
redheeler,fej0m40,t1_fej0a8h,1579152666.0,"Awww.  That’s awesome.  My sister has a chi-weenie. The family adores him.  I know what you mean, after our cat died a couple years ago I didn’t want another one for a long time, but it didn’t take long before I really missed the companionship"
redheeler,feizd8b,t1_feiy63u,1579151540.0,Aw I’m sorry for your loss

AskReddit,fdctf26,t3_ekok60,1578283797.0,"I love Gone in 60 Seconds with Nic Cage.  My husband had never seen it and we finally watched it last month.  I was so anxious it would be super cheesy and would t hold up. Luckily, he liked it!"
relationship_advice,fdcrtau,t3_eko8h4,1578282492.0,I would have even been fine with a message saying they didn’t have a spot for me or they wanted to have a closer knit outing.  It’s the offering and then just not getting in touch at all that makes me feel like garbage.
relationship_advice,fdcrmzi,t1_fdcrd4j,1578282359.0,They all know me.  Very small town.
AskReddit,fdcqly2,t3_eknzz4,1578281593.0,Seat warmer.  So nice on the lower back

CasualConversation,fc6ihyt,t3_egdxlz,1577481376.0,"I (female) also love knitting, beer, playing hockey etc.  I get annoyed by lots of stupid standards that are placed on women and I HATE when people assume I can’t do things because I  am female.... but I am also super proud of the face that I am multi-faceted.  So the nay-sayers can pound sand!"
pics,fc6hdul,t3_egc4h3,1577480619.0,"Wow.  Those are amazing.  I am jealous of your wife’s knitting skills.  I tried to knit my
Niece a really cool Zelda toque a couple years ago.... took me forever.... and then it was too small. Waaaaaah!"
relationship_advice,fc4msmj,t3_efxcib,1577421344.0,"I agree with being straight with the kids.  Our beloved cat had kidney disease and had to be put down two weeks before Christmas a couple of years ago... my littles were two and four then.  I had them come into the vet office to say goodbye while Kitty was sedated before the final sleep.  

My now six year old still talks About him but seems to have made peace with his passing. I wouldn’t have done it differently in retrospect."
cats,fbkkfk2,t3_edqrax,1576951727.0,Ohhhhh.  I lost my dear orange buddy Tigger to kidney failure two years ago. Sending all the loves and good thoughts.
