relationship_advice,ffgke2k,t3_etbsav,1579908252.0,"Life is depressing.  For example, you don’t want treatment because of the cost. It’s unfortunate but true.  You guys sound like you genuinely care for and respect each other and I’d urge you to appreciate that.  It just seems like you both need to change what you are doing on a day to day basis to incorporate more things that make life seem worth living.   And that could mean you go separate ways.  If you love each other then it seems like that’s probably ok.  Sad and painful but probably for the best if that’s what happens.  But it doesn’t sound like this is a point where you should give up necessarily, to me at least."

Empaths,fffsqjc,t1_fffs8so,1579890982.0,"First of all... you are on reddit.  There is zero accountability for what one says here.  Being sensitive to energetic changes can lead to having a very strong intuitive idea of what is going on in a persons mind but it’s not like “oh they’re thinking about pizza”. It’s more like I can tell that person is hungry.  A basic example but no I wouldn’t discount any point of view simply because it seems outlandish to you.  I have met a few people who consider themselves to be an empath who absolutely for certain are on the other side of the spectrum.  So some people just don’t know themselves very well and want to feel special and so they think these things about themselves to help with that goal.  Empathic people can be selfish as well, but it’s usually out of self protection than out of personal gain or egotistical motivation."
Empaths,fffs03h,t1_fffro2a,1579890527.0,"Well “empath”. Is a pop culture word referencing a portion of the population that has a higher degree of empathy.  Most of the actual empaths I’ve met don’t make a show of being empathic.  In fact most empaths I know would prefer to not feel so much.  I can’t speak for the two people you met but feeling everything doesn’t make you a better person.  From personal experience I have acted in unskillful ways because I feel too much.  So yes we exist, no we aren’t magic, no we aren’t better people for being this way.  Just like how a sociopath or even a psychopath can still be a decent human being if they’re aware of themselves."

nihilism,feumwci,t1_feukonv,1579388029.0,"Yeah.  Well that’s what I mean about flawed tools.  Logic is useful but it is by no means an absolute measurement, especially when it is applied to something as deeply ingrained in the fabric of reality as free will or determinism.  It’s like measuring a ruler with the same ruler.  According to this ruler, this ruler is 12” long.  I suppose I just don’t find that answer satisfying.  If I were to form an actual opinion on the matter I would say that both are true simultaneously.  We both have free will and do not have free will but the actual mechanism by which that operates is currently, and I suspect permanently, beyond our ability to quantify.  Maybe once AI and quantum computing become more advanced we will get some semblance of an answer but that’s not exactly us figuring it out."

Second of all I guess I think that consciousness is fundamental to existence, so everything that exists is consciousness.  As far as cause and effect it only really makes sense based on the supposition that time flows in a linear direction, which I personally think is just how the human mind has evolved to survive.  Time is there all at once, it’s a big web of simultaneousness.  Free will or choice doesn’t really exist but it isn’t because it’s all predetermined, it’s because nothing really exists at all.  But in terms of a human mind yes absolutely it does exist, at least to me because I choose to believe this and I have literally
Nothing else to go on.  Does that make it absolutely true?  No not at all but just saying well brains exist and we know a little bit about how they function doesn’t make it absolutely untrue either.  But I don’t really care either way to be honest if it is or isn’t real, I get bothered by people telling others shit that they definitely cannot know for certain as if they do."
