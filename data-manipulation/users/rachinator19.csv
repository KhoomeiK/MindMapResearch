SuicideWatch,ffsqxlv,t3_eut9y0,1580189331.0,I appreciate Kobe but I'm here for me.   I can't make anyone love me.  Can I drizzle glitter all over myself.  I gotta make me love more.  I mourn for the family but I gotta get working for me
SuicideWatch,ffsqge8,t3_euywws,1580188880.0,Hey ifeel that hate towards me every day. It hurts but you are better than that.   Turn that fire inside you to make a positive mark. It's tough right now but keep strong. Ok
SuicideWatch,fecscpx,t3_eo9ex3,1578982765.0,I know how you feel. I'm sorry you feel that way.  I hope you reach out to the resources in your area.  They can help out in so many ways
SuicideWatch,fecs3tf,t3_eogeu2,1578982499.0,"I know you are in a sucky spot right now.  I've been there""still am"". I can't just say rainbows and unicorns craps to make you feel better.  But I can tell you this.  I know you are hurting. You need to feel purpose.   It's hard to see the light when it is dark. It sucks real hard.  But I can promise you this.  It gets better.  It takes time.  It takes effort but you are worth it.  If you need help ask for it."
SuicideWatch,fecqkel,t3_eo2x50,1578980968.0,"I'm sorry you are going through this.  I too have this. It sounds silly but say 5 positive things about you every day in the mirror.   Start out small with I'm alive.  I have the ability to make a silly smile,that's one of the few coping mechanism I have to get through."
SuicideWatch,fecq0md,t3_eoe6rn,1578980458.0,"Just because you feel ""behind"" in life doesn't mean crap.  You are your own self.  I'm not sure of your challenges are but I'm sure you can get on a good path."
SuicideWatch,fecn674,t3_eodrbx,1578978099.0,"Trust me I got the ""eye roll"" many of time.  My friends still cared but they couldn't spend their energy anymore on me to the expense of them.  But if you are in a bad spot call *211 or call the non emergency number. They  really can help you."
SuicideWatch,fecmcfk,t3_eoc598,1578977471.0,I do that too.  But yet I can't fudge over my daughter husband family.  I can easily but I don't want to fudge over everyone for my selfish ass.  Trust me I am more worth dead than alive but I'm the one making the bread. So I got to carry on.  I can't be selfish. I hope you find your happiness
SuicideWatch,fecldvq,t3_eodgl5,1578976781.0,It sucks right now but trust me you can pull out of this.  So what you pissed your mom off.  Teenagers do that.  But leaving you dead that wears on everybody.  Honestly I'm sure they care but they aren't sure what to do to help you.  It sounds like you are sick and tired of bring sick and tired.   Reach out to resources /parents.  Take care.
SuicideWatch,feckpw6,t3_eo9o49,1578976292.0,"Trust me I was in your position at your age.  It sucks.  Being that age and trying to fit in is hard.  But it gets better. We all have our ""I need it now"" feelings but it doesn't come when you need it to.  Give it a week.   Talk to your cat just meditate on that.   Hopefully it gets better"
SuicideWatch,f4z2rh3,t3_dm5jep,1571892638.0,"It took a long time to be happy but I still need the urge""truly"" be happy.  It's a battle.  I do it today. It sucks but I'm relearning"
