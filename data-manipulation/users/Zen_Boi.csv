pcmasterrace,felwebh,t3_epraa4,1579232609.0,My current pc is more powerfull than a PS4 and if in had the money to spend it on a PS5 and would use that to uograde the PC instead it'd probably be as powerful or a bit better. This is kinda a bad comparison anyways because consoles mostly sell the console under value because they get money from the games anyways
