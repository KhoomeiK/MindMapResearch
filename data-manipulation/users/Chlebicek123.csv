Not that I’m happy that you’re going through something, and I hope you can beat it, but I just felt a little bit better knowing there are also other people crying, and it’s not just me.

depression,fe486h5,t1_fe479yp,1578856683.0,"Thank you so much for writing this. I’ve been on Xanax, Zoloft and sleep pills (all prescribed) for two months now so I’m not really scared about taking more of these things. Problem is, my next appointment at my psychiatrist is at the very end of February, and I don’t know if I can actually survive until then. Do you have any tips on how to just get along for those 40 days? And again, I really appreciate your answer"
