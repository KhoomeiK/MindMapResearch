WhitePeopleTwitter,ffnggi0,t1_ffnczs4,1580065620.0,Strange because when I was at my most active I ended up indulging myself a lot as if I deserved junk for being on my feet all day.

videos,ffn20zb,t1_ffn0xfv,1580061119.0,Hmm I grew up drinking tons of whole milk so maybe that's why I'm firmly team 3.5% now (but I don't turn down 2% like some snob).

science,ffm7ufv,t1_ffm1mtv,1580050032.0,"Yes, if you feel like hell and you take any psychedelics thinking they will make you feel better you're sure in for an unpleasant surprise, but just because you have depression/anxiety doesn't mean you don't have good days that psychedelics would make better. They will amplify what you're already feeling, thinking and hoping. That's why it's always stressed to only take them with the right mindset, in a familiar location, with someone you trust et cetera. The headline doesn't mention it but it's not really the headline's job to give instruction on how to take drugs."

actuallesbians,ffls9sj,t3_ety0zl,1580043457.0,">do you think I should sit her down and let her know her comments sound offensive?

Offensive? What? No.. People need to chill. It's obnoxious to talk the way she does, but it's hardly a hate crime. You can't sit people down for disciplinary action just because they find something disgusting and inexplicably keep thinking about it.

Show her the middle finger and leave it at that."

worldnews,fff6t17,t1_fff5yn0,1579877172.0,"I made my comment many hours ago and everyone was saying that those millionaires are virtue signaling and should just pay more taxes if they really want to. I don't know if those comments aren't upvoted anymore, but they're still there."
