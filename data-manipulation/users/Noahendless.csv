Edit:  Since I've had some time to decompress from 9 hours of hating my life, I'm going to discuss this.  One of the major flaws of homework (especially in the US) is that it carries a lot of weight in terms of grading, frequently it's ""do your homework or fail your class"".  To compound that there's the fact that every student usually gets about an hour of homework per class per night, and over the course of between 6 and 9 classes that's a fuck load of work, even if it was only 15 minutes per class per night that would be too much.  And again there's still not much qualitative evidence to support the idea that homework improves comprehension of the material.
