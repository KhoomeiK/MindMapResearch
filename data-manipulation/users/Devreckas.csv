Don't really know how it toys with expectations.  Stormtroopers were already the army of the Republic once in the prequels.  It just seems like minor rebranding.  The guys who look like bad guys are still the bad guys, regardless of what they call themselves.  General Leia still leads the good guys.  

My point is that you say Leia is trying to return ""peace and justice"" to the galaxy.  From what?  Why is the Resistance necessary?  You don't clearly explain that Hux and the First Order are a threat, just that they are rising force in the Republic.  You say he wants to  ""*rebuild the galaxy.""*  Why is that bad?

That's why Sephy could call down an energy blast that wiped out the entire solar system in battle mode while being run through with a sword would still kill someone in real life.  It just worked.

I really wish they would keep that delineation, but I doubt they will.  I really get bored of the AC/Jedi/DBZ power levels and floaty physics in games and movies.  But between the SOLDIER doing a diving rodeo-360-wheelie on his bike and Cloud doing a gravity-defying gainer flip through a collapsing catwalk like its nothing, it looks like that's the route they're taking.

He's basically the only one to have a completely negative revelation about himself.  And where did he come to that conclusion?
