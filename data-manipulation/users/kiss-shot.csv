I've been the victim of one-sided affections and the target of over idealization before. It's hurtful to have a guy (because it's almost always a guy) who you swore you were good friends with turn a 180 and get hostile or ghost you because they couldn't cash in their pal points for a quick handy or a GF pass. It's annoying at the very least and rage inducing at the most. Especially when said people are so affection-starved that you can't even pat them on the shoulder without them catching feelings and imagining your life together. 

I came out as bisexual in my early teens, and around then I'd had crushes on straight female friends. We were as cuddly and friendly as the typical girl pals. I'd dredged up the courage to confess to one of my particularly close friends. She kindly turned me down, which made me sad, but then we continued to be very close friends. No resentment, no hard feelings. No 'women only want to use you then throw you away'. Our friendship resumed as normal and my feelings gradually faded as I got over my infatuation. She and I went on to date several people until we met our husbands. The end.

We as a society need to get together and stop demonizing casual, platonic/familial affection between males. Maybe then they won't grow up into ravenously love-hungry ego monsters that treat every non-related female they know as a potential romantic partner."

Personal accountability and defense are important, but they only take you so far.

It sucks because it seems this young lady did everything right. She was going home with a friend (a male friend at that) and was both firm and short with her refusal of this man. You could say they should've taken a taxi or lyft in the first place but anything could've happened.

I was there once. I had many friends that were there once. Teenage girls: Adult men mean nothing good for you. They're predators. There's a good reason why they go after underage teens and not women their own age. If you don't have a good enough relationship with your parents or trust them enough to help you, then go to a school counselor. If your school sucks, then go to the police. Whatever trouble you'll get in with your parents is nothing compared to the potentially life-long emotional or physical harm a loser preying on children could inflict. 

""Mature for your age"" or ""not like other girls"" are code phrases for ""easily manipulatable fool"". Don't be that fool. I know it's hard when you're a kid with an underdeveloped brain, no life experience and poor judgement, but try to look beyond the honeyed words. Want better for yourself."

I wasn't allowed to bring friends over until my teens, couldn't have any candy in his presence until I was around 10 years old (mom would give it to me, but he'd take it away when she left). Had to leave my bedroom door open (when I was 14 he up and removed the door from the hinges until my mom yelled at him until he put it back. He didn't actually reattach the door to the hinges. I had to do that). He'd also randomly steal things from me 'for my own good' or 'to keep me from doing wrong'. 

For a while, I was forbidden from using the first-floor bathrooms because he thought I'd been trying to flush suspicious things down the toilets. I also wasn't allowed to draw (I am an artist) outside of my bedroom because he thought my art was demonic and would tear it up if I left it out.

Around age 15 I found out he has paranoid schizophrenia. Everyone in the family knew, but since he was the primary breadwinner and affluent, nobody did anything. Many of his paranoid delusions revolved around me because I was the odd kid out (different father, born during one of he and mom's many several-year legal separations) so it just compounded onto the abuse he was already dishing out."

What sets camming/premium snapchats/paid photosets apart from your average, abundant porn is *percieved intimacy*. A lot men who peruse these gals want more than just a random (faceless in their eyes) porn actress to fap to. It's like a parasocial fuckbuddy... But instead of actual sex you just pay to masturbate to them. You'd be surpised just how much money folks are willing to pay just for the idea of the girl on the webcam/phone to know they exist. Just look at streamer e-girls. It's like hiring an online escort, but their pesky social awkwardness ineptitude won't ever get in the way. (Except in OP's case. lol)

It's still a sucker's game though. All camgirls and online sex workers know this. It's not nursing or caregiving, the attention is as simulated as it is in food service/hosting. E-girls don't care about you, they're just trying to make rent. To think so is on the same level as thinking your Hooters waitress is into you because she called you 'hon'."
