ChoosingBeggars,ffr528x,t1_ffq2dbe,1580150620.0,"Yep. Typically people adjust their personality depending on the people they’re around. Some minor and some major (and I’m not including fake people in this, because they know they are acting different on purpose. What I’m talking about is unintentional). 

For example, it’s possible that you have no problem with swearing so it doesn’t matter to you if you swear or not. The odds of you swearing when hanging out with people who swear go up a lot and can go down to almost zero if not zero with people who don’t and you night not realize it.

That's not true. I mean some cases sure. But I've seen plenty of ugly people in a relationship with an extremely attractive person. Or like a buddy, who only likes overweight girls fo,r example. I, myself, are overweight (working on cutting down) and my current and past girlfriends have all been pretty thin (though weight doesn't really bother, it's just coincidental).  
This girl in high school was in a fire when she was younger and has horrible scarring and wouldn't be considered very attractive to most people, yet she has a pretty nice looking husband now.  


My point here is that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Incels have dug their own grave because there are plenty, of women who are attractive who would date them, however a the end of the day it's their personality that is the turnoff, not being below average attractive, overweight, short or the other thousands of things they blame their own failures on."

Showerthoughts,fem1yny,t1_fel0jls,1579237120.0,I’ve always thought if you brought someone from the 5th century straight into a building they’d be fascinated by the lights and then getting into an elevator they’d be confused why you locked them in a small room with you. And then be even more confused when the door opens into a new area.

We had to replace one of the elevators once and after they took the cart out I took a peak down it (only security and the contractors working on the elevator were allowed in the construction area so I took advantage of that.)

And I’ll say looking from 10 stories up to the basement it pretty scary when you think about this box carrying you all the way up that high and how much of a fall that would be."

Plenty of things have been named multiple things because people don’t know they have a name. Since I don’t know OP granddad I just said why I thought he named it. 

Thanks for the link. Interesting read. Next time, try not being so hostile.

Edit: that’s also why I said “probably” I was agreeing that the plant had a name before then. Especially being out of country. I never once stated that comment as fact. It was pretty obvious that my comment was made as an assumption and not fact. And didn’t imply that UC Davis created that name."

Racism is elevating one race over the other. If a black person puts down a white person for being white (or any other race for that matter) it’s racist. Obviously same for white, Mexican, Asian, Ect. 

I get it, racism towards black people still exist and it’s sickening. I don’t personally understand why it exist, since skin color is literally based off a chemical in your body. But regardless, any race can be racist to any other race."
interestingasfuck,feltere,t1_felsztr,1579230479.0,">didn’t have a proper name in English yet

Probably this or something similar. I don’t think we started keeping records of plant names until the 1750s. I would assume a university based on research probably had access to a lot of research prior to their opening, however, being in a time period where you can’t just call up another university (especially in another country), probably didn’t have documentation of it and searching for documentation would have been a lot harder than just documenting it themselves."
