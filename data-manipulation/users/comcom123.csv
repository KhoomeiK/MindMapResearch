The face moosh!"
cats,feqewr2,t3_eqejt9,1579341078.0,She is insanely skittish. You could move your arm and inch and she would go running. Last night was the first time I ever got to pet her. I was so happy!

dogpictures,fdgl9gp,t1_fdge09o,1578401116.0,No. It was artificial insemination most likely then carried to term by a shepherd mother.
dogpictures,fdej9ba,t1_fdeivn8,1578340202.0,"She’s a very sweet, friendly, and sociable dog. She’s incredibly smart. She picks up on me being upset really fast and always tries to cheer me up. She’s cuddly, not much of a barker, and wants to be  friends with everyone!"
dogpictures,fdehhgr,t1_fdec0s5,1578339122.0,"Only in the car. She’s got wicked anxiety and abandonment issues and before I got her, everytime she was in a car she was being sent to a different home"
dogpictures,fdehdrf,t1_fdegmqy,1578339060.0,"She’s six, actually. She’s 17lbs right now. She’s not going to grow much more."
dogpictures,fdduq3j,t1_fdduo1f,1578324451.0,She was someone’s designer dog. Artificial insemination and all that. Then they decided they didn’t want to keep her. Their loss!
AmItheAsshole,fddq9lw,t1_fddfvu6,1578321083.0,Yes. I cleaned the kitchen before I left. They used my dishes and left them like that. I never expect them to do my dishes. Good question!
AskReddit,fddd12p,t1_fddcnlw,1578306412.0,"Jewish people are a nation, actually. They aren’t a nation state.  A nation is a group of people bound together by a unifying factor, like language or religion. The first states formed were nation states based on language like France and England (Spain was an outlier and really weird) 

Nations and states are different things. But yeah given the assumed definition OP meant, you’re right."
AmItheAsshole,fdcy0dj,t3_ekp668,1578287664.0,"NTA 

Boy have I been in your shoes before. You might want to see if there’s something else bugging him if he doesn’t usually blow up about this sort of thing. 

You offered everything you reasonably could and he got mad. Pretty simple."
AmItheAsshole,fdcxruj,t3_ekp6g4,1578287455.0,"YTA, but not the worst asshole. Like you said, small hill to die on.

Just becuase she didn’t have this issue with kiddo number one doesn’t mean that it isn’t an issue with this pregnancy. Each time is super different for lots of women. 

I’m a total creature of habit I get not wanting to switch, but you could try it out at least for a nigh, see if that helps."
AmItheAsshole,fdcx512,t3_ekp3mu,1578286901.0,"INFORMATION I FORGOT TO ADD 

This isn’t the first time dishes have been left like thins, though this is the longest time. I have talked with all parties together about the issue and been told it wouldn’t happen again."
AmItheAsshole,fdcx060,t1_fdcwwjp,1578286785.0,Super valid point. I forgot to say In my original post I’ve talked to them about it before.
