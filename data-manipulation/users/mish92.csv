BipolarReddit,ffi90ep,t3_etpqr5,1579968186.0,SingleCare (like GoodRx) has it for ~47$! I think that’s for a 90 day supply of 3mg.
PourPainting,feyilh8,t1_fexal4d,1579445939.0,Thanks! It’s a lid to a tote lol nothing fancy
PourPainting,fet2x18,t1_fesyv8h,1579371316.0,Thank you!
bipolar,fejlc19,t3_epgysp,1579178775.0,"I love my Vraylar! The only side effects I've noticed are drowsiness (though a lot of others here tend to experience the opposite I've noticed) and occasional muscle twitches, but I'd take those over having mixed episodes any day."
bipolar,fejl76t,t3_epinxp,1579178641.0,I adore my cats...but my dog for whatever reason stresses me out. It didn't used to be that way so I'm not sure what's changed.
bipolar,feiivbx,t3_eotmn4,1579139552.0,"I’ve been on it for a year and I love it. Brought me out of my mixed and manic episodes. I only experience drowsiness and occasional muscle twitches.

Edit: my insurance doesn’t cover most of the retail price, but the company that produces it has a retail coupon that can bring it down to only 15$."
bipolar,feiies3,t1_fegmcor,1579139250.0,"If you can’t find your medication on GoodRx, there is another coupon type app called SingleCare!"
bipolar,feifrxq,t3_epbbt7,1579137499.0,"I get mixed episodes mostly, with a lot of rage, so I really like The Red by Chevelle...I know that’s just a specific song but I can’t think of a band I specifically listen to."
bipolar,feiakw7,t1_fechx0w,1579134009.0,The company had a coupon that brought it down to 0$!!! I could cry from happiness!
ADHD,fehf962,t3_ep1i9b,1579115327.0,I'm trying to lose weight for good this year...I've logged all my foods for the past 3 days! Also I went to the doctor instead of avoiding it because I knew I'd have my blood drawn.
bipolar,fe7zbda,t3_eo2w4u,1578920781.0,"I went to pick up one of my prescriptions (Wellbutrin) and they told me it was 100$ more than I paid last month, something about a deductible. I don't remember this happening in January last year and now I'm freaked out that my Vraylar is going to be 1100$ when I have to get it this Wednesday. :("
bipolar,fdvqkx3,t1_fdt9l9j,1578750361.0,I have three! A [dog and two cats](https://imgur.com/a/xJM64Lf) :)
ADHD,fdsr1c1,t3_emu37s,1578706832.0,"I once cut an onion in half, placed it in a baggie, then put the baggie on top of the microwave next to our air freshener thing that blows air. Our apartment reeked once that onion started rotting."
bipolar,fdsmnsa,t3_emxosa,1578705209.0,I take it at night because it makes me drowsy but I’ve seen others on this sub that it does the opposite for them.
bipolar,fdqa9gb,t3_emn2ny,1578660958.0,such a pretty kitty!
bipolar,fdobypn,t1_fdnuz0b,1578602411.0,Same! Whenever I don’t I’m just not ok.
ADHD,fdn6ahw,t3_em5y2f,1578578463.0,"I was diagnosed with both, but I didn't accept the bipolar diagnosis until years later when I realized it wasn't just ADHD. After taking care of the bipolar with mood stabilizers, I still have ADHD symptoms. I don't remember if my psychiatrist ever said anything like this though."
bipolar,fdn38xt,t1_fdn2ux1,1578575983.0,AP=Antipsychotic. Another thing is Vraylar can increase your cholesterol so I have to get blood draws every 6 months or so to monitor that.
bipolar,fdn2gsh,t3_em95qu,1578575297.0,"Vraylar is my first AP so I can't say anything about switching or any other drug, but I love my Vraylar. It brought me out of my manic/mixed episodes. It makes me drowsy (I've seen a lot of others say it makes them wired so I guess it just depends on who you are) and I get some minor muscle twitches here and there. Other than that I haven't noticed any adverse effects."
BipolarReddit,fdhpgbg,t1_fdhkogb,1578427549.0,I had no idea it could cause acne and now I'm wondering if that's why my face won't stop breaking out. :|
bipolar,fdhhkda,t3_elf0sh,1578422791.0,Yay! I didn't see your other post but glad you got those this morning! I love my Vraylar!
ADHD,fdf7cc7,t3_el02ej,1578354992.0,I totally know how you feel. I use a digital journal called Daylio and one of my activities I track is showering!
bipolar,fdf4015,t3_el216n,1578352787.0,I’m sorry they’re doing this. I’ve never been hospitalized yet my psychiatrist and psychologist both agree it’s BP1. Can you get another opinion or are they your only option?
bipolar,fd67gi2,t3_ek5nm7,1578186639.0,Congratulations! That’s so awesome!!!
veganfitness,fcxdilu,t3_ej1j2v,1578060019.0,Get back into an exercise routine and stop being a junk food vegan!

ADHD,fcv8wrx,t3_ej33dt,1577997091.0,"I’ve been bullet journaling for about a year now. I don’t use it really on weekends or holidays but I use it during the week for work. The only way I’ve made it work is to look at it at least twice a day, in the morning when I get to work and at night before bed. I used to use it as a mood/symptom tracker which really got me into a habit of using it too. It helps me a lot, I can’t use digital ones because I’ll just play on my phone instead of using it. Like right now I’m on reddit instead of doing whatever I need to do for work."
BipolarReddit,fcv8byj,t3_ej2b0r,1577996746.0,"I’m a scientist, been at my company going on 2 years now. I keep a fairly regular schedule at work and home and take my medication daily. I’ve been on my meds for a year and have been stable for ~10 months."
bipolar,fcv3ogy,t1_fcv1e66,1577993989.0,"I’d say yes...because I have mixed episodes most of the time, which for me usually means extreme irritability. Like dropping a pen twice in a row would set me off. Screaming, punching/hitting tables/walls, throwing stuff, crying...not a normal reaction to dropping a pen."
