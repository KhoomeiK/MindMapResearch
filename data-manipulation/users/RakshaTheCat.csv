Why feel bad about it though? One does what they have to in order to survive. Although, hmm, what kind of society do you live in that makes connections necessary? I thought you usually just need money? Social connection can help with it of course, but I thought they aren't usually necessary?"

I'd say any kind of nice feeling is fun. From eating something tasty, through bonding with a dog, to writing code that does what I want. All give me nice feels.

If not fun, what do you live by?

Good you've managed to find yourself right people. That seems to be hard, even for relatively normal people :3

> Most people aren't capable of such high level of functionality.

I actually don't get it, living alone seems to be much simpler actually, since other people mostly add problems while not really helping with much. That said, I'm quite privileged by being interested in programming, so it's much easier for me to find source of income if necessary. I don't need a partner to pay for my expenses.

> PS. You are human, too.

It's actually humans that constantly suggest I'm not one, so I stopped referring to myself as one. I don't need label for myself anyway, I don't think in tribal ways like that. And I meant it more in psychological sense, since I obviously do have human body. I seem to be much simpler than humans though, maybe a cat would be better label for myself."

And yes, I think I've been always like that, although of course when I was a kid, it was hard to enjoy life fully due to being codependent on family or school. Biggest obstacle in feeling joy were always people, or lack of resources to survive. Once resources for survival are secured and annoying people removed, life became serene and pleasurable experience, with only minor worries most of the time.

I begin to think it's impossible with humans though. They are basically made out of ego and sex drive, and both of those things I find kinda gross... I mean, to each their own of course, but with a dog, I can at least share joy of simple walk. Apparently it can't be done with humans, they will just ruin it by being loud and talking about nonsense...

Kill it with fire. And then nuke it to be sure >:3

Hard to say, but I feel joy or contentment a lot. Then I decide to deal with humans for a bit, and I start feeling disgust... Internet is good for that, since I'm getting glimpses of real personalities here, while in real life, humans tend to hide them behind politeness... :3
