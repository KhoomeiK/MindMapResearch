AskReddit,ffpf3ep,t1_ffp8t0r,1580093470.0,"Yeah, it's hard because even if you're completely over them and no romantic feelings left towards them, especially if you lived with them for years, 99% of everything involved them in some way. Almost everything I do, I do with him, so any little anecdotes involve him."
LifeProTips,ffpebv8,t1_ffpcb4z,1580092919.0,Can confirm. I've lived in Texas my entire life and there's just no way to know what the weather will be sometimes. The weather man lies.
science,ffooayq,t1_ffntqwy,1580079875.0,Are you sure you're not talking about OxyContin? The only way Oxytocin is administered (that I know of) is through a nasal spray.

worldnews,ffj34vg,t1_ffivjna,1579989192.0,"People who go out when they're sick piss me off. I understand that sometimes people HAVE to go out. Sometimes you can't take time off from work or whatever. But so many people will just go about their fun as normal, spreading their sickness everywhere. At least wear a fucking mask. 

I am so tired of getting sick."
worldnews,ffj2ar5,t1_ffihw19,1579988601.0,"I get sick easily and so often and when I do get sick I end up staying sick longer than my family so I've debated wearing a mask through all of this. But since I'm in the US, it seems sort of ridiculous to do. I know it's overreacting."
worldnews,ffj1o14,t1_ffitdy8,1579988147.0,"They fired the Wuhan governor because among other things, they didn't report the virus for a while. States in the US occasionally cover things up as well. Just because it's supposed to be ""one entity"" doesn't mean that local government actually works with the central government. It has nothing really to do with political parties and more to do with different people running different places and power struggles."
worldnews,ffj14u1,t1_ffiiqk6,1579987761.0,"Without help, it will spread. It's already been confirmed in multiple countries, including France and the US. This isn't just a china problem."
worldnews,ffiwx3i,t1_ffiuzf5,1579984704.0,"My grandmother now goes to a Doctor inside a hospital but for most of my life we've always gone to clinics. I don't think it's exactly a ""old-timey"" thing. Most people I know, their Doctor isn't in a hospital."
AskReddit,ffgid9g,t1_fffvu49,1579906915.0,I'm Italian and corn in spaghetti actually sounds pretty yummy.
worldnews,ffcv4g2,t1_ffcmr1n,1579807889.0,We're definitely worse in terms of CO2 per capita. We just send all of our industry over there so they have to deal with it.
worldnews,ffcuxn1,t1_ffcn0bm,1579807774.0,The entire point of his post is that it's not Koalas they're eating. I don't see him exactly disagreeing with the rest of your comment.
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,ffcrvjf,t1_ffcj7kr,1579805982.0,"[They're allowed to literally deny you based on having a high IQ.]( https://abcnews.go.com/US/court-oks-barring-high-iqs-cops/story?id=95836) They want people like that, so it's not surprising those types get in."
worldnews,ffcpe4j,t1_ffch2qx,1579804382.0,"Can you clarify?

Edit: I suspect he's talking about the old ""Chinese using fetuses for soup"" lore. [Snopes.](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fetuses-found-in-chinese-restaurant-freezers/)"
AmItheAsshole,ffakb7y,t1_ffajliu,1579737860.0,Exactly this. People aren't telling you to buy junkers. Just a slightly used newer car.
AmItheAsshole,ffajzbp,t1_ffa5gqb,1579737622.0,"There's a HUGE difference between two decent $14k-20k cars that they don't have to worry about and two $60k cars. The amount they've spent on cars right away gives a hint into the type of people they may be. So that's why people are expecting them to be the type to run out. (Which is crazy common when people win the lottery.)

If they do run out, they now have a higher premium with car insurance than they had before. If they decide to upgrade their house, that's now higher taxes than they were paying before."
AmItheAsshole,ffaji72,t1_ffagzb8,1579737279.0,"I'd give my way of life a small raise, like get a cheaper house instead renting, a decent car that I'm not afraid will break down, and then the rest would be exactly for savings. Maybe travel occasionally. At $26k to six figures, you could double your way of living and still save far more than that. 

They're definitely right though. People will buy big things that they actually can't afford in the long run. I just want a little upgrade."
