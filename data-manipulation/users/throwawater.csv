AskReddit,fez0u9k,t1_feyu8yd,1579452870.0,"They also borrow against their non-liquid assets. You can basically annuitize large amounts of money by investing them long term in things like S&P 500 index funds. On any given year, the value of your investments can go up or down, but over a 10 year period the money will almost always go up at a rate of about 10%. But, that money is locked up in stocks so you can't use it like cash without also losing the investment growth. 

So what people will do is borrow against assets like that. Say you want to buy a million dollar property. You *could* liquidate some stocks or other assets, and pay cash up front to avoid paying interest. It sounds like a sensible move, but it's not. If you're making 10% year over year, it does not make sense to sacrifice that to save 4% on interest over the life of the loan. Better to get just enough cash for a good down payment, and then pay the loan off at a normal rate, all the while letting your own money grow much faster."

From the wiki:

>In [political science](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science), the term banana republic describes a politically unstable country with an economy dependent upon the exportation of a limited-resource product, such as [bananas](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana) or minerals.
