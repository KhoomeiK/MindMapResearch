LosAngeles,fgo4oyh,t1_fgnswxr,1580959712.0,"> there are literally millions of poor people who work crummy jobs and they have kids

While I'm deeply sympathetic to Latino immigrant families to the US, what would you have me do here? I'm asking honestly. Should my wife or I sacrifice our careers so we can have kids before we feel comfortable doing so to be more .. on par, I guess, with others? Virtually everyone that I went to high school with that went on to college has enormous student loan debt that they will live under for several more decades because their parents had children before they could financially sustain them for more than 18 years. Should I inflict that on my kids too?"

But there's no way we can afford to have kids and maintain anything close to our (comfortable, but by no means extravagant or affluent) lifestyle. All of our family is back in the Midwest, so we're functionally alone in terms of child care.

wow,fgesf38,t1_fgergjl,1580708357.0,"> As long as people like you get in their feelings when someone criticizes things that don't work in a game that was once markedly and irrefutably better (I was criticizing the game! Not you! You didn't even make it! Did you?), things won't improve.

I'm hesitant to throw around insults like ""dude you're projecting here,"" but .. you're kinda projecting here. I haven't even played retail since the second patch and don't have a dog in this fight, largely because I'm not a huge fan of the direction the game went in general. I agree with you whole heartedly on the RNG rabbit hole, and the constant feeling that I was playing a very deliberate, explicitly designed skinner box of engagement, and haven't played in retail in quite awhile.

Is the game _broadly_ as bad as you're suggesting? I don't know! It might be. I know a lot of people seem upset, but again, a lot of people _always_ seem upset with each new patch, so it's really difficult for me to have a good grasp here. The general discontent is the same as it always is: some people like new features, and bunch of old guard are decrying the incredible failure of patch x.yy.

Again, I'm on board with you for some complaints here, but when you throw around lines like

> even career apologists avoid addressing them

you're being outrageously hyperbolic. For a reply that is so focused on ""I'm not insulting _you_,"" you are weirdly, solely focused on a bunch of assumptions about me and .. ironically, anyone else criticizing the general message of what you're saying. Again, I don't play retail (or Classic anymore, due to irl time commitments), but someone pointing out that maybe your delivery is a little problematic =/= Blizzard apologist.

I will say this, though: you're taking your current frustrations with the game to an extreme degree, while looking back at TBC/Wrath with rose-tinted glasses. Fuck, I actually wrote a blog post almost a decade ago about how Wrath's cross-server queue would be the death of the social aspect of the game. (It was, and is the biggest reason why I bounce off of each expansion after a month or two.) TBC's reduction of raid sizes from 25 -> 40 literally killed guilds that couldn't accommodate, arguably the most important part of the entire game. Garrisons somehow managed to incentivize raid logging to an absurd degree, and an actual requirement for getting into Legion guilds was whether RNGesus blessed you with the right legendary or not."
wow,fgepwws,t1_fgep3at,1580706054.0,"My point here is that every patch, people think that it is the _worst patch ever_, and that it is a clear sign that Blizzard is a pale shadow of what it once was. Maybe the content sucks. Maybe the Heart of Azeroth sucks. Maybe Garrisons suck. Maybe being _required_ to get an RNG legendary to be competitive on DPS sucks (a point almost never mentioned when people talk about their love of Legion). 

Maybe C'thun being _literally unkillable_ sucks. Maybe loot lag sucks.

I get it. You, and a lot of others, are frustrated. Maybe this very well is THE WORST PATCH EVER, and it is a sign that BLIZZARD IS OFFICIALLY DEAD. But again, this point is made literally, and I mean _literally_, with every iteration and minor update to WoW. 

Take a deep breath. Give the patch some time. Developing software of any kind -- but _especially_ games -- is extremely difficult. It will be fine."

* What should be in my portfolio?

Also, I'm a technical writer. I explain how the features engineer and designers work to our customers.

and what I think is a fundamental misunderstanding of what technical writing is as a _profession_, not a task that must be completed.

While it's true that you should have at least a general understanding of the domain you're writing for, it's extremely important to emphasize that you aren't writing content about the industry, you're writing content about a _tool_. You need a very strong grasp of how the tool works to properly document it, but the technical writer should never, ever be the industry expert. It's not your job to know, or to even explain, how to understand the finer details of whatever the output of the tool is, but rather to show people how to get to that output.

graphic_design,ffehnpw,t1_ffe0tfu,1579848391.0,"> You need a current portfolio to apply for a new job

While true, you own literally _none_ of the work you produced while employed at a company. Your employer has absolute, unilateral control over how and where the work you produce is reproduced, and can absolutely bar you from including it in your profile .. 

Which is why you lock your portfolio down with a password, and give access only to prospective future employers. Legally speaking, this is a little dicey and you can definitely be hit with a CND, but if they never see it then they can't really do anything about it.

> You can’t compete with your employer for 2 years

This one is heavily dependent on where in the US you are (or, if OP isn't in the US, which country). In California for example almost all non-compete clauses are immediately void and unenforceable, but if you're in a shitty state with no protections then your employer can indeed go after you for working for a direct competitor. In practical terms, it's more likely that they will try and sue your next employer rather than you, which can make it way harder to get a job.

> how can they prove what you're doing at your new job?  Who's going to rat you out on this?

If the company is particularly litigious and suspects that you're using work (_especially_ algorithm work) you did while at the first company, then you, and your future employer, can be totally fucking ruined by this. While no one in the new company is likely to rat you out, if they get subpoenaed then they _have_ to, if relevant, show where they got the algorithm from. If you stole it (and yes, _stole_) from your prior employer, then you're in for a whole world of trouble. The biggest case in recent memory was Uver v Waymo. The tldr here is that an employee left Waymo for Uber, and along the way gave Uber Waymo trade secrets. 

It cost Uber almost a quarter billion dollars and a literal stake in their company. Do not -- and I cannot emphasize this enough -- use work you did for one employer at another.

Rhetoric, or the art of persuasion, is arguably the oldest formal theoretical and educational discipline. A huge body of other types of thought sprang directly from rhetoric (and philosophy more broadly).

Formal rhetoric has three components: logos, pathos, and ethos. You can think of these as arguments from reason and logic (logos), arguments from character and credibility, as in, you should trust me because I'm your doctor (ethos), and emotion (pathos).

What I'm saying here is that using emotion to persuade people is literally a core, fundamental, and equally important part of persuasion as logic and character, the basic idea being that different types of arguments work better on other people. 

Jonson isn't trying to get anyone locked up for being a psychopath. He's not trying to formally influence policy. He's just trying to get people to empathize with a group of people they otherwise may not. Seeing as how a defining attribute if psychopathy is a total lack of empathy, suggesting that someone be empathetic is a thing a psychopath would do is ... Well, it's crazy.

A key aspect of evaluating psychopathy is how the subject relates and responds to other people. Which, you know, aren't really present when a single person is speaking on stage. It's really difficult to see of Jonson is manipulating anyone when the _entire purpose_ of a talk is to persuade -- another word for manipulate -- an audience. 

If you read his books (or listen, as I have via Audible), Jonson comes across as a deeply empathetic man with sometimes flawed arguments and rationale. I like his work a wholt lot, even when I find it problematic as I did with his book about pornography. Again, because writing is also a performance, it's hard to say how much of this is deliberately affected, but in the many Jonson books I've read, he really, genuinely seemed to be affected by the people he interviews. Like his entire schtick as a writer is literally empathy, as highlighted in _So You've Been Publicly Shamed_ to what I found to be a profound degree.
