For me back surgery was easier because I wasnt feeding a baby every hour & a half and my hormones were not raging like they do after birth. I was also a very active, in-shape person before each of my babies. It takes 6 months to fully heal and after a year you will realize you finally feel like you did pre baby. Give yourself some time to get back in shape. Your body needs the time to heal & get back to normal. Congrats on the little one!"

JustNoSO,fdzu1jx,t3_endhsf,1578795785.0,Boy do I ever know that feeling of guilt for the choice of father for my kids (both adults now). One kid from a previous marriage was abused by him to the point of a suicide attempt and the other (his child) has become so much like him yet he will have almost nothing to do with her. I'm so sorry you & your adult children have been betrayed by him like this. I can't really help in any way but to offer my empathy & understanding.
JustNoSO,fdztguu,t1_fdz11u7,1578795408.0,"This would be my hill to die on. With her behavior in the past. If she moves in, the kids & I move out & he can pay support for the kids. And no visitation where MIL is present."
