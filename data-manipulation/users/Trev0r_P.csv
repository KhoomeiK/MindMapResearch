unpopularopinion,fge06u7,t1_fgdzni8,1580688926.0,"But it does hurt others. It hurts the people who are committing suicide at what I know you agree is an incredibly concerning rate (~40% lifetime attempt rate).

I used the box analogy obviously bc of your username but also to demonstrate the absurdity of transitioning children. Your son is not a box and will never truly be a box. He will more than likely grow out of it, unless you replace his skin with cardboard. If he transitions to a box as a child, he will be a part of a demographic which suffers from an attempted suicide rate on par with that of people suffering in nazi concentration camps no matter how society views them. It is unbelievably dangerous to normalize this."
unpopularopinion,fgdmupe,t1_fgdm93m,1580684199.0,"Well then I assume you refer to your son as ""boxkin"" and allow him to replace parts of his skin with cardboard. 94% of kids who feel like the opposite gender will grow out of it.

forwardsfromgrandma,fg5b96k,t1_fg596tm,1580522961.0,"A) I'm not saying that all leftists are violent, that would be silly. And I dont blame you or any politician for the violence that has occurred (because that steps dangerously towards the ideas that foster racism). What I am saying is that there are millions of good and bad people on either side but when we see protests turn violent it is often the result of leftist groups, specifically antifa.

B) no republican (or democrat) worth their salt supports racist policies such as racially motivated redlining. I am in opposition of any kind of discriminatory policies whether they be corporate or governmental, as are you and nearly all Americans on either side of the widening political divide.

C) there are racist cops; to deny that would be to blind yourself, but it seems we wre in disagreement over just how widespread the issue is. Police are people like you or I. They're not taught to shoot black people, and for the most part they don't. In fact, there is a very strong correlation between income and crime rate and many low income neighborhoods are predominantly black. We shouldnt immediately jump to race as the reason that black men are incarcerated far more than any other demographic because, again, this is an idea which can very easily lead to racism. My personal opinion is that the rhetoric that is pushed by the media that all cops are crooked and out to kill you is one of the most dangerous ones that they could possibly push (#1 is hate speech, #2 is gun control). In fact, there is a correlation (not causation, mind you) in increased shootings and anti-police media.

This is a lot of generalizations but sometimes that's required because I dont know all your views on every topic. At the end of the day, we're both people and we both want the world to be a better place. We just disagree on how to do that, and too often people think that that means we shouldnt respect each other."
