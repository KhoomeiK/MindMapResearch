Kikpals,ffuvglh,t3_evclbf,1580250099.0,I'm laughing at the thought of someone who has the audacity to call themselves cooler than cool. That's definitely going to yield the opposite result.
gaming,ffun1cy,t1_ffujfbl,1580245406.0,"Uhh that PS4 is about to be obsolete pretty soon. I don't see how you consider that a deal. You've got like 2 years of ""modern games"" left."
gaming,ffumo03,t1_ffujy0k,1580245191.0,"TF you talking about I play PC on a 60in tv. Shit works like money.

Edit: disregard. Misread the comment"

PublicFreakout,ffqry42,t1_ffpyqpe,1580142260.0,Imagine the smell in that building. How would they ever clean it?!
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffqpv9e,t1_ffqi6bn,1580140858.0,"I mean I guess it's good that you understand the stuff we go through but I don't think anyone is using the verification to target people. I've never had any issues with it. If anything, it only helps back up your legitimacy in this sub."
mildlyinteresting,ffqpb9o,t1_ffqjh9m,1580140482.0,Stranger danger
videos,ffov1ar,t1_ffonwqw,1580082119.0,"Not to discredit that show/episode, but there's so many memes that got way more recognition on boondocks than they did when they really happened. That scene was almost word for word what happened in real life, as well as that ""I just wanted to do hoodrat stuff with my friends"" scene."

blackcreatives,ffmzqrq,t3_eu2a64,1580060546.0,Man this is so dope! It reminds me of this novel I read that was published in the 20s. Similar art style.
blackcreatives,ffmzet2,t1_fflsjeq,1580060441.0,Canon Buster's was pretty good. Hoping they bring it back for a second season.
ChoosingBeggars,ffjh8pv,t1_ffj347x,1579998184.0,"Nah he's a little bitch. I roast all my homies and this is just bitch shit. Btw, my homie and I ride motorcycles and asking to ride someone else's bike is a capital offense. If they offer, that's different."

THAT SHIT IS DEAD

Fact: people who can freestyle well RARELY translate into people who can conceptualize well enough to make a song that stays on topic. 

Work on your writing instead."

houston,ffj3iia,t1_ffj35xw,1579989463.0,"I don't care about who's an enthusiast or not, that's exactly the point you missed. All I was saying is that the post isn't about cars so all this car talk is completely unnecessary. Furthermore, there's exactly NO EVIDENCE of what kind of car/person did this, so it's pure pretentious speculation. 

No one gives a fuck about Houston cars and coffee in this post and that's why this shit is irrelevant and pretentious. Good day. 

Get the fuck off your high horse."
AccidentalRacism,ffiz9in,t1_ffiylt1,1579986399.0,No I'm enjoying your displeasure.
