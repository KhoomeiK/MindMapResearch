Sorry, NO!
Putting serving a fucking salad on par to the time I was raped and pushed down a flight of stairs by an ex, or ANY of the horrific real abuse anyone has endured, makes me wanna rip my hair out.

*Hmmmmm*
Sounds like someone is letting their true feelings slip out. What happened to being fat being the best thing ever?

Also, they always go on and on abput how people shouldn't assume that fat people are lazy, or they eat too much or exercise too little.. but when they look at thin people they can assume the thin person was just 'born that way,' and 'lucky' instead of acknowledging that they work hard to be thin. 
A bit hypocritical if you ask me."

It all seems so simple, but people don't realize a lot of us are legit lost when it comes to even the basics of creating a healthy meal plan for ourselves.

fatlogic,fd96lx9,t3_ejjy31,1578229214.0,"How would one even ask their body for consent about dieting or *anything*??

And even if the body *could* consent or not consent to things on its own, the body is an IDIOT, it NEEDS our brains to lead it!

For example, when being sexually assaulted sometimes a man will get an erection, or a woman will have an orgasm, even tho they are being ASSAULTED, and DO NOT CONSENT. 
The brain knows that for whatever reason, they did not want to and would not have chosen to have sex/feel pleasure with the attacker, but the body just does whatever regardless, because it's dumb. 

If I ate every time my body wanted to and had every thing I was craving (for example its 8am and Im craving a gaint coke slushie) I'd be super obese. 

When I was younger I tried drugs and loved them, kept doing them and then my body was addicted and by the time I wanted to stop, it was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life because my body craved them. So by FA logic, I shouldve just given my body what it craved and continued to ruin my life??? 

The body NEEDS the us(brain), the body IS us?? Sorry for the rant but I'm like astounded that they would even try to make this argument. Jesus"
