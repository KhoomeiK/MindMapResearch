RealEstate,fg6ae9l,t1_fg43tyy,1580561344.0,"It's not the customer's responsibility to cover their agent's brokerage fees. A brokerage that mandates a transaction fee is ripping off their own agents and forcing their agents to pass the ripoff onto their clients. I worked at a brokerage that was acquired and the new owners started requiring a $395 ""regulatory compliance fee"" on every transaction. I never charged my clients the fee and paid it out of my commission. I left to open my own brokerage shortly afterward so that I could treat my clients fairly and not get ripped off by my own broker.

Your agent, whether you are buying or selling, is already being paid through commission. Transaction fees identify the agents that you should be avoiding. The usual excuses are; we have to pay for the staff that handles the transaction or my office will not allow me to omit the charge. Whatever lame excuse they give you, immediately cross that agent off your list. If they want your business the agent will drop the fee but the fact that they tried to stick it to you should disqualify them from getting your business. NEVER pay a transaction fee."
