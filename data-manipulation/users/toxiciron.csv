Edit: PSA: If your gums bleed, the antidote is to floss more often.  Eventually, they won't bleed.  They bleed because they're sensitive because they're inflamed because they're being eaten up by bacterial colonies which can be broken down/scraped away by flossing more often.  They release acid as a digestive byproduct.  Your saliva is a bit antibacterial but won't work on solid colonies of bacteria.  If you keep flossing, the colonies will 'stay down' and eventually the gums will heal, stop getting inflamed, lose their sensitivity, and then it will hurt much less to floss again in the future.  Plus no blood.  So think of it like your goal is to make your gums bleed, because you're probably doing more good than harm."

Obviously anything that's that shape can't be going in a circular or elliptical pattern (at least all the way around the nucleus), because it's 'confined' to its balloon (though the balloon isn't a constraint on its location but rather a gradual probability density).  Maybe it's whirring around in the balloon?  Maybe it's kind of... everywhere in the balloon?  In any case, each 'balloon' exerts its own force on the other 'balloons'.  Personally, I interpret the electron as kind of a general force which looks like the balloon unless it needs to be confined to a single point in space."

Like you have a mask on, and the more they like the mask, the more it subconsciously validates that your true face underneath is hideous.  Someday, you're afraid the mask is going to crack, so you limit your exposure with people.  I do the exact same thing all the time.  It's why I only have one actual friend.

I think the solution is to 'be yourself' all the time, express vulnerability often.  I think people gravitate towards someone who acts like this anyway.  I think that if you and I do this, there will be a lot more positive results than negative ones."

socialskills,fcjj2hz,t3_eh8h4l,1577689532.0,"This sounds to me like a lot of the stuff HealthyGamerGG covers.  Do you play a lot of video games?  Like... A LOT a lot?  If so, I recommend watching his university series on YouTube, but I'll also break down his points in a nutshell (and I'll add some of my own observations)

Again, I'm going to assume from here out that you play video games a lot (like me):

1. You don't know what you like or dislike because video games a) disconnect you from the real world, b) define for you your exact goals, c) make the goals easy to attain, d) goals are specifically designed to be attained, e) screw with your dopaminergic systems leading to i) lack of motivation, ii) playing games for hours each day and realizing by the end of the day that you didn't even enjoy it.
2.  You don't have an identity maybe because video games have kept you from finding your purpose in life.  For instance, since I've started my game fast I've been getting into cars and am considering going back to school for automotive engineering.  Without a purpose, you have no sense of north, south, east, or west, no goal and no journey.  You feel like life is a list of to-dos until you die.
3.  You aren't lazy.  You lack motivation.  There is a key difference.  If you spend all day playing games and neglecting important things, then obviously you are highly motivated to play games in spite of the crappy things going on around you.  You lack motivation for things in your everyday life because it's all diverted to games, mostly just because of your fucked up dopamine system.
4.  I'm not so sure about bad memory but I have that too.  Like, really bad.  My coworkers look at me funny ALL. THE. TIME.  I'm going to chalk this one up to low T.  Since I've been consistently lifting weights for the past 6 months or so, it seems I'm catching up to everyone else.

I could go on and on but I'll stop on the chance that you've never had an issue with games.  But maybe someone else will read this and be helped."

gaming,fcbpkyl,t1_fcbp7kh,1577589559.0,"Since when did it become so cool to be so negative?

E: Wow, this is getting a lot of negative responses.  u/47567, I'm not implying that you are trying hard to be cool or anything, this is more of a comment on more general stuff.  But I really believe that people like to band together around how bad things are and this type of thinking is a positive feedback loop.  I often see strings of people commenting in unison about how everything is terrible and there's always this sense that it's someone else's fault.  Well if some thing is someone else's fault, then I have no ability to change the situation and I am justified in venting about it publicly.  I think people jump on that.  And it does nothing to actually help the situation, especially when things are not someone else's fault.  We are so quick to shift the locus of control externally, and that can be a bad thing in a lot of situations."
