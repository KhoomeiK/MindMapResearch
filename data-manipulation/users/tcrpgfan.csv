writing,ffbxvzh,t1_ffbwoum,1579786280.0,"Even then, I still put horror in games above other media for one simple reason... they can and oftentimes do fuck with you as an audience member. Since the person playing the game is the main character of the story and they often make excuses as to why you can't just leave. Silent Hill is an eldritch location that's *sentient*, for instance. You're not leaving until the town decides you can, if at all. Or how in Resident Evil 1 they clearly state that going out into the woods, where there are packs of zombie dogs outside of the mansion, meaning you're sacrificing a tactical advantage and a potential safe zone (not that it's truly safe) for uneven terrain and an unknown amount of threats outside. Plus, the biggest thing that actually does affect sales, the ability to actually be able to participate in the plot is a huge factor why the scene is bigger than other mediums. Also, video games can break through the fourth wall to terrify players. Nothing is scarier than having a game say 'Your save data is corrupted.' then reveal it was all just a hallucination on the characters' part."

One of the top contenders for game of the year last year is Resident Evil 2, the remake of the 1998 Horror classic that was essentially responsible for the Zombie boom in the 2000s. Before that, Resident Evil 7 fired up a massive storm because it was a good game both with and without a VR headset. Then there's PT, the playable trailer for the cancelled Silent Hills. Which was going to be a collaboration between Hideo Kojima (director of the Metal Gear series), Junji Ito (famous horror comic writer known for works like Uzumaki), and FREAKING GUILLERMO DEL TORO. Also, don't forget Alien: Isolation, a well done Alien game with plenty of good horror. Heck we've even got legitimately good narratives in horror games like in Silent Hill 2 and the Last of Us (Though the latter is more about survival than horror).

But I'd also point out there are plenty of other games that were stuck in dev hell for that long and turned out pretty well. Like Final Fantasy XV or Fallout 3. Cyberpunk is probably going to be more like those since while it was in hell, it wasn't because of indecisiveness on the devs part, just really fucking bad luck. Hackers who got their hands on the source code for one version of the game and held the data for ransom. CDPR just went 'fuck that noise' and released all the sensitive data related to the game publically. The latest version most likely got its start sometime in 2017 as a result of that.

With that said, I know that when the gameplay demos usually drop, they've generally finalized their core gameplay aspects and have taken how things affect gameplay balance into account.
