trashy,ff82glw,t1_ff815cj,1579664237.0,"Fully agree, especially in areas that get snow/ice.  My car was totaled in a wreck about a month ago and I wouldn't have been able to afford another one out of pocket without the $8k ish the insurance paid out."
pcmasterrace,fey0ha7,t1_fextx75,1579439117.0,It also reduces the OSes they need to support.  You don't need dev's on 7/8/10 all at the same time.  I cant imagine the manpower to maintain so many operating systems ... not to mention server OSes as well.
pcmasterrace,fey02lw,t1_fexxse1,1579438959.0,You can still at least upgrade for free if you have a 7/8 license.  I did it last week on a pc.
nextfuckinglevel,fefhlnw,t1_fef0ffo,1579056490.0,"Yeah, I'd just combine their scores and flip a coin on the actual color."
insanepeoplefacebook,feff50t,t1_fef8dga,1579055008.0,"I do the same.  Change is annoying and worthless to me most of the time.  I rarely run into a vending machine, it falls out of my pockets in my car and if they add up all their change they can exchange them for bills at the end of their shift I'd imagine.  Though, I also rarely carry cash because of this exact reason."
insanepeoplefacebook,fefef4w,t1_fefapy0,1579054562.0,"Huh, I've never dealt with change from delivery before.  I normally give them the rest as tip or ask for x dollars back if it's a big price difference.  I've never thought about it before.  Carrying all the coins would be a pain I'd imagine."
television,fe4mo6t,t1_fe41735,1578860903.0,I dunno if more will watch it because Bill was pretty big with their audience.  More people will probably finish it though.  Less of her audience will stop watching irrelevant of the garbage she spews.
WinStupidPrizes,fdm5oo4,t1_fdltjgg,1578540413.0,"Was it a big one like in the video?  Or was it one of the small ""normal"" ones?"
WinStupidPrizes,fdm571u,t1_fdm2hcw,1578540072.0,I'd say it makes you do stupid shit but not this stupid/possibly life threatening.
alcoholicsanonymous,fdcrs58,t3_ekfcol,1578282468.0,"Hey bud, just went to my first meeting at 31. I've been drinking since 17 (a fifth - a half gallon a day).  Cant honestly say I'll stick with AA yet but it wont hurt.  Good luck."
todayilearned,fd3v7gj,t1_fd34br1,1578161913.0,"There definitely are.  I am one (working on it) but I work full time, wife is a SAHM and I spend all my off time with the kids before bed time and on weekends.  Being an alcoholic is shitty but doesn't necessarily make you a bad person or parent.  I've changed all of the kids diapers more times than I can count."
todayilearned,fd3t76y,t1_fd3fems,1578161412.0,"Yup, horrible to look at and clean but poop wont smell much until they eat solids.  Though, normally the poop blowouts stop by then which is a nice consolation."
todayilearned,fd3q90u,t1_fd2mlc8,1578160752.0,Ugh I hate my commute of 45 mins to and from.  I hope you live in a warmer area because snowy weather makes it worse and longer.
todayilearned,fc72mix,t1_fc6yh0g,1577495883.0,"Most of the time I'm not hungry enough to justify a buffet personally.  A large entree is more than I'll eat In 1 sitting so having leftovers is nice.  Though, you miss out on the variety that way too.  The rest of the family and I differ too much to share much either.  But the buffets around here are normally pretty good and busy so fresh food is rotated in pretty frequently."
todayilearned,fc6xlgd,t1_fc6qxvq,1577492102.0,"Really?  Are their entrees big or something?  Chinese is probably one of the cheapest options here even from the small mom n pop spots and their prices seem pretty equal so I just avoid it.  Though, the Panda Express here doesn't deliver and other places do.  Typically that's why we get Chinese food in the first place.  Plus for around a dollar more per person there's chinese buffet options as well."
iamverysmart,fbg98di,t1_fbg5fgj,1576840866.0,I'd imagine so.  Without knowing their medical history or anything advising them treatment could do more harm than good.
