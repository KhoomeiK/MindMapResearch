I think that's bullshit. Just because he was cleared, doesn't mean he didn't do it. It just means there wasn't enough evidence to proceed with the investigation."

I'm sure they don't have any bias and their sources close to the investigation are totally legit. But let's dive into the article.

> The investigation into the couple’s parenting accelerated when Overland Park police checked on the boy in March and found bruises and welts on his body.  Both Hill and Espinal have admitted to investigators that they spanked the 3 year old with their hands and a belt, but prosecutors can’t determine for sure which parent, or if both, went too far.

Ok, so they were beating their kid to the point he got bruises, but they totally didn't break his arm. Right, sure, great.

> Investigators quickly agreed with the medical staff that the broken bone was the result of typical accident involving a rambunctious toddler, consistent with reaching out to brace for a fall.

And of course this totally exonerates Hill. If the kid fell it couldn't have been the parents' fault. No way they pushed him over or anything. Ignore those bruises. Totally unrelated. Just a kid who fell and broke their arm.

> The investigation into Hill and Espinal began weeks after the broken bone was first treated, when Espinal, according to sources, asked a third party to call authorities and tell them that Hill was responsible for the boy’s injury.  Espinal has admitted she was trying to shame Hill because in her mind, he had become too controlling and abusive again in their long and stormy relationship.

And yeah, she totally made that up to shame Tyreek because he was acting abusive. But abusive in a controlling way, not abusive in a physical way. Right. That checks out.

I don’t disagree that misogyny is a terrible problem in the film industry generally and the Star Wars universe specifically. What happened with Kelly Tran was awful.
