ElizabethWarren,ffdlevy,t1_ffd3mej,1579823364.0,">I think that (at least on this sub) there is a pretty good understanding of the difference between the two.

I completely disagree. Though things might be better on this sub, the general public has no true understanding of what the word ""socialism"" means. Ask twenty Americans for a definition and you'll get twenty different answers.

A big reason for this is that so many things have been labeled ""socialism"" or ""socialist"" with little regard for their actual meaning. Either way, until Americans have a definition we can all agree on, this semantic mess will continue to plague that word.

EDIT: a word."
Teachers,ff6xfg9,t1_ff5zvoj,1579636872.0,"I refuse to pay for things in my classroom. I truly understand why many teachers have gotten into the habit, but I also think that there comes a point when they should stop. There should be an explicit message to their students' homes that some lessons/projects will not be taught since teachers will not fund it out of their pockets anymore.

I'm trying to think of a way to make it clear to parents that their child's classroom is underfunded."
education,fetyuti,t1_fet3edz,1579381440.0,"She sounds like a find educator. Unfortunately, the administration she worked under came up seriously short in effectively addressing what is wrong with education in our country."
education,fetykjz,t1_fet2izw,1579381349.0,"> While I agree with your sentiment, it's worth noting that previous education secretaries have been skilled or knowledgeable in SOME way.

I'm wondering why you think the Department of Education should be able to lower the standards for leadership by so much. Could you imagine if the Department of Defense had only had two heads with any military experience? How about if the Justice Department had only had two heads with actual courtroom experience?

Arne Duncan's experience was as a policy wonk. Not only had he never taught a day in his life, he openly advocated for policies that hurt public education. He was clueless as the college loan situation grew into a national disaster, pushed for more charter schools, and was culpable in leaving teachers out of the basic design of the Common Core standards. He advocated for policies that helped corporations more than students.

I voted for Obama. I would have done it again, seeing as Republicans would have been much worse. But I cannot find it in me to say that his administration did right by students."
education,feshdru,t1_fer9rc3,1579365141.0,"> Trump hired people in every department that could destroy that department. Seriously, that is why.

Whereas Obama did what almost every president did before him and selected yet another in a series of educational dilettantes who'd never taught a day in their lives. Trump's selection is particularly loathsome, but let's remember that the Department of Education has been in the pocket of private interests for a very long time."

AskLosAngeles,fe6del3,t3_enyld1,1578887646.0,"I live nearby. It is a stable middle-class community. The schools are considered very good. You're also near a couple of freeways. 

There is a wide range of homes available. As with most of Southern California, home prices are at an insane level. If necessary, you should be able to find a nice rental, providing you can afford it. Surrounding cities such as La Verne, and Glendora are also good. 

I guess the rest all depends on what kind of amenities and lifestyle you prefer."
education,fe5kbmy,t1_fe4lx6m,1578870479.0,"As with public school students, it depends on the home. I've seen a wide range performance from former home-schooled students in my classroom. However, there seems to be a correlation between the income/prosperity of the parents and the students they educate. Put simply, if the parent educating them knows what they're doing and is diligent, the results can be good (and vice-versa)."
education,fdxg1y4,t3_en97zi,1578768393.0,"First off, let's remember one thing:

**SCHOOL HAS A MUCH SMALLER INFLUENCE ON A CHILD'S ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE THAN THE HOME THAT STUDENT COME FROM.**

This video explains some of the factors behind teachers leaving, but leaves out a huge amount of information. It's hard to know where to begin . . .

\* Countries like Finland have socialized a lot of resources that children need. For example, they have 'cradle-to-grave' healthcare. That means their parents had the necessary medical attention from the time their mothers became pregnant and all the way through their schooling. THIS IS HUGE.

\* Because Finland provides free, high-quality daycare for families, this means they have pre-natal and infant care. Their children are far healthier than ours. This means better mental health and better performance in the classroom.

\* Finnish parents are given the [resources](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/04/finland-only-country-world-dad-more-time-kids-moms)to be more involved in raising their children.

\* [Finish parents get a government stipend for each child they have](https://www.kela.fi/web/en/child-benefit-amount-and-payment).

\* Finnish schools actually follow what the research tells them will work in the classroom. In the U.S., we let fuck-wit politicians and rich dilettantes capture the public discussion about what works. That's why we are keeping students in the classroom longer than necessary, don't let them play enough, force-feed them curriculum at ages that aren't developmentally appropriate, and test the god-damned, mother-fucking shit out of them.

\* Finally (and the video is really deficient for not recognizing this) **student behavior** is forcing a huge number of teachers from the the classroom. There is plenty of evidence to support how changes in society is affecting how children behave, but the sorry fact is that there are thousands of schools where teachers face an amount of stress that is intolerable. I've listened to teachers ask about what to do with a student whose family sleeps at a local park, had their 'uncles' move into their apartment after being in prison, or bring drugs to school because they didn't want their moms to take them any more.

I'm sure Finnish schools aren't completely free from these social ills, but I do know they have much less than American schools do. They have a social safety net that alleviates a great deal of the problems that American students bring into the classroom.

One way governments have responded to the rise in behavior issues is to take 'zero tolerance' of tools like school suspension. This, in fact, is a well-intended and right minded policy. Most of the students who are out of control can be helped with interventions and additional resources. The problem? *Most schools don't have these resources.* (Is anybody surprised that state and local governments insisted they not suspend student, yet didn't provide the financial support to make this happen effectively?)

I could go on, but at least I hope we can address what the video talks about (remember--the classroom is the smaller factor in the child's success.)"
