BoomersBeingFools,ff21g37,t3_er4zva,1579491233.0,I can't imagine being this outlandishly joyless and anal over a movie.
politics,feemkex,t3_eomrz2,1579036795.0,"Whatever you do, for the sake of your own sanity, don't go down to the comments section of the link.  *Somehow* his supporters are trying to spin this as a win for Trump?"
gaming,fe6lip1,t1_fe4k2sh,1578894928.0,"If you get the chance I'd recommend giving III a second try.  It suffers some pacing problems, especially in the beginning, but its overall story is still really solid."
gaming,fe6lftp,t1_fe4frp6,1578894845.0,"Yeah, IV was a real ball dropper.  III gets a bad rep but I think that's more because it had to follow the incredibly solid story of II and the three different heroes made it harder to get into at the start but its final product is still good.  IV was just... kind of a dud.  V though really picked up that steam again.  I would kill somebody for a sixth installment."

facepalm,fdhj3dh,t3_el8uz7,1578423718.0,"I've seen this story pop up six or seven different times with different pictures attached.  I'm beginning to suspect it's another case of bullshit made up to ""own the tree huggers""."
funny,fdfh6i9,t3_ekzxfn,1578361599.0,Correct me if I'm wrong but that doesn't even look like an adult elephant.
politics,fd495pe,t1_fd486ku,1578165490.0,"The French were being denied a basic human necessity.  The US is rapidly hurdling into that same territory (denial of clean water, denial of accessible health care, etc).  I don't think the American people are as numb as you believe."

todayilearned,fd3wl8d,t1_fd36n9l,1578162275.0,"""I am a Klingon warrior, and a Starfleet officer. I've piloted starships through Dominion minefields; I've stood in battle against Kelvans twice my size; I courted and won the heart of the magnificent Jadzia Dax. If I can do these things, I can make this child go to sleep!"""

videos,fcjh6zl,t3_ehbf5o,1577687461.0,I'm just happy that it's actually the Inspector Gadget theme and not Hall of the Mountain King.  It is truly *infuriating* to me how many people mix the two up when labeling remixes.
WTF,fc66qld,t3_egbwqh,1577473540.0,"A scam.  A ""get fit easy and fast!"" device that gave no results but swore up and down it'd turn you into that beautiful swimsuit model in only a few short weeks."
