college,ff668yl,t1_ff5ryr4,1579620131.0,"I don't like tinder tbh. Parties are for hook-ups, I thought i wanted that but I actually don't."
college,ff4qz8h,t1_ff2cnty,1579570334.0,I did all 3 my first semester. Went to a party or drank with friends every week. Still got good grades. Slept 7-8 hours a day.

nattyorjuice,fe07che,t1_fe0791x,1578804982.0,"You don't need steroids, he's a normal guy that lifts."
Brogress,fe026co,t1_fe01n60,1578801209.0,"Your being sarcastic, but seriously bro spend less time overanalyzing things and just lift hard and consistently. I can't promise you'll see the same results, but that's all you can do."
Brogress,fe014bg,t1_fe00ac0,1578800504.0,"Bro I'm not gonna argue with you, why would I lie. I'm 18 years old I just enjoying lifting. This is just a hobby for me it's. It's not that serious. Maybe the scale I used wasn't accurate. I myself was shocked that I weighed 185lbs. But the time between the 2 pics is between 3-4 months. I literally know nothing about steroids. I just think I have good genetics."
Brogress,fdzz99t,t1_fdzyv7d,1578799348.0,Does it look like I gained 20lbs of muscle. Clearly I also gained fat. I was extremely lean on the left pic. Also I have a bit of a pump on the right pic. I have decent genetics bro.
Brogress,fdm1lq9,t1_fdm0a8d,1578537645.0,I don't do cardio

Brogress,fddhs09,t1_fddhlsf,1578312826.0,That's 2-3 years of lifting and being a sprinter in highschool. I was just lean

Brogress,fddfusk,t1_fddee3x,1578310410.0,"I mean I ate 5-6 big meals everyday. I clearly didn't gain all muscle. Maybe 8-10 pounds of muscle. I'm only 18 years old. I'm honestly just as shocked as you are bro I just decided to train and eat like NFL football player, during my first semester at college. These were the results."
Brogress,fddedqq,t1_fdd2fpu,1578308395.0,"B:335? S:385? D:430? These are estimates I kind of forgot tbh. Don't really stick to a strict routine, I just feel it out at the gym. Just never repeat muscle groups."
Brogress,fdde465,t1_fdd3wrh,1578308013.0,"Yea, I also had a bit of a pump on the right pic. I'll just take those comments as compliments."

Brogress,fdc9sm9,t1_fdc8zae,1578269927.0,"I hate saying this and it makes me sound like a douche, but literally all I do is lift 5-7 times a week. Nothing special. No shortcuts, no tricks."
Brogress,fdc8e0r,t1_fdc82lj,1578269109.0,I appreciate that bro lol. Just hard work man

Rateme,fdbbcwe,t3_ek9ful,1578255696.0,Search up Tammy Abraham. Get his cut. Y'all look like brothers.
college,fd7gumo,t3_ek7ueh,1578204294.0,"Don't introduce yourself, just make sure to sit near someone. Then to kind of break the ice, you can ask if freshman or sophomore etc. Maybe ask their major. Then you should gage how they react, to see if they seem like their looking for friends. Not everyone is looking for friends.  If they seem friendly then try to continue with small talk. That's it. Just every class make sure to say hi and have small convo."
college,fd7ftyr,t1_fd7b607,1578203818.0,Do you go to school like LSU? I go to an average size state school of 10k students. I wish we had that many parties.
Rateme,fd732wy,t3_ek6hjo,1578198822.0,"7/10, just keep hitting gym bro. Also I think the high fade looks better than the low cut."
amiugly,fd4pmgu,t3_ek1bvo,1578169823.0,"You need to lose weight, but you already know that. Other than that  you have a lot potential to be really attractive. Especially if you loose some face fat. Right now your average maybe a bit below."
Rateme,fd4oo5b,t3_ek1hxb,1578169460.0,You look creepy in certain pics. But 6/10

amiugly,fcydy07,t1_fcxiqvs,1578078618.0,"Let me be real, you look like a nice girl and most guys won't really be all over you. But your definitely not ugly."
amiugly,fcydsbu,t3_ejgak3,1578078556.0,"You aight, not super hot. But your decently cute."

amiugly,fcybq97,t3_ejin45,1578077773.0,Tbh we can't really tell you have a hat on.
amiugly,fcybguv,t3_ejdk3t,1578077670.0,Imma keep it real with you. You look younger then 17.  Your not ugly and you definitely have potential. I'd recommend you get a fuckboy fade. It works trust me. Then start working out you look skinny fat. Those will change your life. Right now 6/10.

nattyorjuice,fc6z6j7,t3_egi16n,1577493289.0,"He looks natty. But at 160 at 5""10 that's an insane body, and hard to maintain."
BulkOrCut,fc272cu,t1_fc1s99q,1577343397.0,I mean a lot a highschool football players look like this at 17. Cuz they start lifting at 14.
