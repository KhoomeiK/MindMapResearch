MachineLearning,fgvf7iq,t1_fgvdm79,1581147757.0,"Well first of all, I don't think that would make the world worse. It would increase what people can do with technology. For both good and bad ends, yes, but the bad part would go away once people learn to stop treating a mere voice as something that can be trusted.

Second, even if I did see that as making the world worse, I wouldn't call the person releasing the technology the guilty one. If people end up using the released technology to make the world worse, then they're the ones making the world worse.

It's also worth pointing out that, if something is going to happen anyway, it doesn't really matter who caused it.

(If you think about it in a very theoretical and abstract way—something I do a lot—you could also derive, from your attitude, a view that other people's interests should sometimes take precedence even when it comes to something as personal as how one's own body works. After all, you can imagine a perfect duplication of another person's voice, right? There's a perfectly capable algorithm right there; all that's missing is sufficiently-lossless output hardware.)

Does anyone mind explaining why I'm being downvoted? Is it just that people disagree with my ethical views, or is there something I could be doing better while expressing those views? Disagreement isn't what downvoting is supposed to be for but I know people tend to do it anyway, so I'm not sure. (I hope views like mine aren't that terribly in the minority here, but I've been wrong before.) And if there is something I could be doing better, I want to know what it is."
ReverseEngineering,fgvc0yb,t1_fgv7jxc,1581143980.0,"I never understood why people have such big problems with people who cheat in non-ranked gameplay. Just like you said, it's harmless trolling, as long as it doesn't go on too long. And if it does go on too long, it's still nothing to make a federal case over, just another method of griefing. But no, even if you only turn on a cheat for a few minutes in an unranked game, just to troll some people, that's generally a guaranteed permaban even on a first offense, and people will treat you like you deserve it. Is it seriously that much worse than other types of trolling/griefing, I mean really?"
MachineLearning,fgvbw4e,t1_fgvb8lm,1581143833.0,"Yeah lol, I realize I asked in a pretty loaded way. :P Sorry if you were offended or anything; I just find it annoying when these developers act like they're obligated to take responsibility for preserving a status quo that (IMO) should have been gone the second this technology became possible, at which point it amounts to nothing more than a false sense of security.

In case that wasn't clear, I mean artificially limiting what kinds of voices you can duplicate, or adding watermarks, that type of thing.

If I had the necessary skills—hopefully I will someday, not just for this reason—I'd make a deepfake voice generator and just put it out there unrestricted. Both to aid in the legitimate things it's useful for, as well as to put another nail in the coffin of the not-always-warranted sense of implicit trust people feel merely by hearing a convincing voice.

Why is that burden on the defendant?

(Not that that should necessarily be enough.) Not to mention, the condition in this case (a sincere religious belief) is entirely personal to the defendant, with no externalities.

According to Google, all that ""aberrant"" means is ""departing from an accepted standard"".

Yes, I know it mentions children. But notice it says ""*particularly* children"". Besides, even if we are only talking about preventing children from developing sexual interests, all that matters is the potential harm to the child. This has nothing to do with society at large, so whether or not they consider the specific interest in question to be ""normal"" is totally irrelevant.

I know this type of thinking is sadly nothing new for lawmakers; it just struck me how plainly they're saying, without even questioning, that ""not normal = bad"". (I do appreciate that they attempt to provide a rationale for the law though, even if it isn't a good one.)"
