BoomerTears,ffdgvbi,t3_et0qyh,1579820593.0,"I mean I understand what you're saying but by that logic we should call modern rap ""zoomer rap"". My point is generalizing a genre of music to be attached to a certain generation is sorta short sited since obviously not everyone in that generation likes that genre. Also there's a paradox in your theory; if no one wants to go see local bands cause they'll never get big and people just listen to the most requested on the radio then how did any bands get big in the first place? Every band started somewhere, even ""boomer rock"" bands. There were a lot of ways to share what music you liked back then, sharing wasn't invented when the internet came along. 

That's completely ignoring the fact that classic rock has had a massive influence on music as we know it today, it isn't irrelevant or outdated in the slightest. I'm not saying it's the best cause music is subjective and I don't even like classic rock that much. But to deny it's incredible influence on modern music, song writing, and especially production would just be plain wrong. There's a reason that the Beatles and the Stones are still revered. There's a reason that Abbey Road and Unknown Pleasures are touted as some of the most influential records ever recorded. It was a behemoth of a genre. So conclusion: like what you like, stop attributing genres to certain generations."

CapitalismVSocialism,fe9runc,t3_eo338y,1578940946.0,Not a Maoist but from what I know of Marxist theory the movement of China towards a more capitalistic minded economy is probably a long game to raise living conditions and stimulate the economy then move back towards Maoist or Chinese Communist tendencies. As Marx theorized that in order to establish Socialism and eventually Communism there would need to be prior history of Capitalism to raise material conditions and create abundance. Marx thought that socialism would and could only arise out of an already industrialized and economically abundant nation which China was not during it's revolution. It was a nation of farmers and peasants. So the Chinese government moving towards Capitalism could be seen as a longer version of the New Economic Policy in the Soviet Union.

todayilearned,fdlg8js,t1_fdl3oyi,1578523358.0,"I'm not saying that I would do any better, you misunderstand. I'm actually saying quite the opposite. Metallica have lost their energy and fire that they once had, as we all do, and thus it's foolish for them to try and recapture it like they tried to do with the last album. They should move on and come up with a new sound or direction or just straight up retire instead of rehashing old ideas from the past in some vain attempt to retake their old glory. Being able to move on with change and accept it is an important part of growing older and it feels as though Metallica haven't gotten that. Or maybe they have and the fans just get upset when they try anything new (Load, Reload) that they feel forced to do the same thing they've always done. I'm not really sure but whatever the reason may be I thought the last album was bad."

But the point I was trying to make is humans are making a very conscious choice to kill these animals for a variety of different reasons (I'm not saying they're good or bad but that's just a fact) but now we've reached the point where it's out of our control. Where 500 million animals and a vibrant ecosystem are being destroyed and there was nothing we could do about it. At least with the meat Industry we have the option to stop or at least slow down at anytime, it's in our control. But now we've fucked the earth up so much that natural disasters are taking out animals and wild life and even when we TRY to save animals and life on Earth it doesn't always work. It's more random and unforgiving. I just fear that we may reach a point where we want to save the animals and the ecosystems but we won't even have the option to because the damage is irreversible. Whereas with industrialized meat it's not. That's all I'm saying."

9.1 million people starve to death every year. Now you may say that this isn't the US's problem (even though it should be) the US produces the most food in the world however this is seemingly useless since it wastes 40% of that. Which is directly as a result of Capitalism. Food producers would rather throw good food away since they can't profit off of it than give it to those in need."
