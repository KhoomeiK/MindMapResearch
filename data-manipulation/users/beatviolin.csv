SuicideWatch,fcllxgh,t3_ehosf3,1577750871.0,Ugh. :( Yes. Constantly on my mind
SuicideWatch,fcg5xht,t1_fcfjv23,1577636791.0,Goodluck to you too. Thanks for taking the time to respond :)
SuicideWatch,fcfi7un,t1_fcfgkod,1577630237.0,Haha. No no. I meant living my life feels like being stuck in a job I don't like. But yeah what you said still applies. Yep have to try and look for a change.
SuicideWatch,fcfe7kx,t1_fcfds2k,1577629046.0,Thanks. It feels like being stuck in a shitty job for the money. It keeps me going but I'm just waiting for the moment when I realise the money just isn't worth it. And to quit.
SuicideWatch,fcfd149,t1_fcfc4ef,1577628791.0,"Hmm. That's a good point. Maybe I just keep on going until I reach that point and maybe I never do. That's not a bad thing either. 

I hate living. God."
SuicideWatch,fcbsruf,t3_egyeqz,1577590563.0,"So so true. Even on my best days, when I genuinely love life and look forward to things to come, I want to kill myself. It just seems so easy and nice."
mentalhealth,fah448q,t3_e94y1v,1576078718.0,Yes. Hundred percent. It is definitely one of the important reasons I don't want children. I won't be able to handle it. I can't be responsible for another life. I already feel so guilty for what my mental health does to my friends and family. I don't want to live a life of guilt. I want the freedom of being able to give in to my illness now and then. Children doesn't grant you that freedom
