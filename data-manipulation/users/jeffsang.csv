AmItheAsshole,ffgak51,t3_etgtnf,1579902010.0,ESH - It's your kid and he needs to respect that you can leave her with whoever makes you most comfortable. But you're an asshole too for dodging his questions. You should also be honest with him about your trust issues.
AmItheAsshole,ffga6vi,t3_etgu0l,1579901786.0,YTA - You went fishing for compliments and reassurance and upset that you didn't get enough of them.
AmItheAsshole,ffg9n3q,t3_etguwp,1579901446.0,"NAH - Honest mistake (assuming it's true you were hanging out with an A-list celebrity)

Also, FYI, no such things as a ""recovered"" alcoholic, that would mean he could drink again. He's always going to be a recovering alcoholic."
facepalm,ffg4ptr,t1_fffq8xx,1579898411.0,"Right there with you.

Could be that the guy knew the former CEO?"
clevercomebacks,ffg3j5a,t1_fffvdmu,1579897679.0,"Wow, this is honestly shocking. What's most surprising is that it's over 10 years later and this is the first I'm hearing about this.

The articles are kind of vague though on how exactly Paulson pressure the banks though other than saying that their regulators would make them? What did Paulson threaten them with?"
AmItheAsshole,ffg27zz,t3_etfp94,1579896870.0,"YTA - There's no way you can sabotage birth control and NOT be the asshole. If you were ready for a baby and he was still hemming and hawing, you should've had an adult conversation about it.

If this story is true, take it to your grave though."
AmItheAsshole,ffg1ugt,t3_etfqpi,1579896639.0,"YTA - It's a little weird that you didn't even say hi but asked for some booze. I think if you have 2 separate friends watching these interactions and commenting on this behavior, you should heed their advice."
AmItheAsshole,ffg1ezc,t3_etfmgq,1579896369.0,"NAH - You'd also be an asshole if you purposefully disrespected her time the way, (i.e. RSVP'ed for the party, then didn't show up), but you're not obligated to go celebrate a birthday of someone you don't think respects you.

However, I'm saying NAH because it sounds like what you're interpreting as disrespect might be this person dealing with anxiety/depression. My uncle gets depressed sometimes and will blow me off last minute because he's not up to hanging out or leave me on read for days. He's not doing it to disrespect me but because he's just not up for any kind of social interaction."
AmItheAsshole,ffg0gfg,t1_fffzwdf,1579895784.0,Exactly what I thought as well. My guess is ESH.
ChoosingBeggars,fffz8x9,t3_etdryc,1579895038.0,Got a link to your art? I'd totally pay $10 for a piece of commissioned art.
AmItheAsshole,fffydd3,t3_etf57z,1579894497.0,"ESH - Your quip was a little rude, but I agree it didn't warrant her responding the way she did. 

You're an asshole in general for your attitude about paying for porn. This is the livelihood for a lot of content creators. I'm not saying you can't ever enjoy it for free, but if there's some site or model that your really like, pay them for the service they're providing for you. Instead, you seem to feel entitled for them to create endless amounts of porn for you and offended when they have the gall to even request that you pay for it."
AmItheAsshole,fffwdk2,t3_etex6b,1579893252.0,"NAH - It might have been a little insensitive for your mom to tell you, at 15, that you were an accident. However, it was specifically in response to you modeling your life after hers so it's understandable that she would want to give you all the facts. You're not an asshole for being upset by that information.

2 things: 1) Unless she told you otherwise, the fact that you were an accident does not in anyway mean that you she wishes you hadn't been born or wishes her life would've turned out differently. 2) I think you'll be better off if you don't try to put a goal on the age at which you'll have children. The most important thing is for you to at a stable point in your life and ready for children. Perhaps that'll happen by age 22 for you; perhaps 30; perhaps not til 35."

AmItheAsshole,ffft4ex,t3_etduwh,1579891221.0,"NTA - As an adult, birthdays should just not be that important that you should expect other people to reschedule major life events so it doesn't conflict with your birthday. Hell, if anything, I'd love it if my sibling threw a huge party with an open bar and it happened to coincide with my birthday. You have no reason to be sorry or apologize.
