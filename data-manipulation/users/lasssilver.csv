- city planet

- wookie planet

- clone planet

They’re  just planets with slightly different jobs.  It’s like the buildings on your Main Street, the bank, the hardware store, the cafe.. they all do little different things.

Characters? Because the characters are generally standard archetypal character seen in tons of writing.  Fallen hero, rouge, princess, old man with wisdom, young protagonist, the fool, dark villain.. 

Or are we talking story arc? Which I think is different than world building.  I’m not saying George is bad at stuff.. I’m literally just wondering what people mean by “world building”... and wonder if that means anything more than just “Well.. his idea for Star Wars was a good idea”.. cuz I’d agree, but that’s a one-off idea not per se anything  more than that."
