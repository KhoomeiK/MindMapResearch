teenagers,ffoe22q,t1_ffo992s,1580076686.0,Me too. The only reason I can post about it on reddit is because it feels like yelling into the void. I tend not to get attention on my posts and that actually helps a lot. If I tell anyone close to me about it my anxiety either gets in the way or I know the won't care. Being able to hide behind a screen is so comforting for me that I get to talk about this stuff.
