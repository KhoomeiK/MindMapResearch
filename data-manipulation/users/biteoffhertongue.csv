AskReddit,fdza546,t3_en3igv,1578788162.0,"This is extremely recent.

Last year, there was a guy who went to my school, a grade above me. His girlfriend (who is one of my closest friends nowadays!) was amazing, extremely gorgeous, and overall one of the most amazing people I've ever met. I also had a boyfriend at the time, and had been with him before they got together. At the end of the school year, this guy left to go to a private school.

Fast forward to this year. I was still with my boyfriend, but things were deteriorating quickly...by the time November hit it was crashing and burning. I left on the 2nd of January this year, early in the morning, and I don't hold anything against him. Shortly after I reconnected with the first guy a bit more, we started talking a lot (I always wanted to be better friends, but I ended up falling on my face for him), and I accidentally let him know that I had a gigantic crush on him...

People may say I've moved on too fast, but we very recently got together. I haven't been this fucking elated in forever. I feel so worthy, fulfilled, and happy about life. He makes me feel amazing, and the smiles he gives when he sees me light up every day ablaze. Back then, we both had S/O's, and probably wouldn't have given as much of a chance...especially considering we've both glown up a lot. But now...our only regret is that it didn't happen sooner."
