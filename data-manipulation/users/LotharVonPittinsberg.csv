Armor was a lot mor common in Europe. The steriotype is a knight in full plate and mail, but that only applies to a specific time period. Large amount of padding works verry well against a blade and was widely used for regular soldiers all through European history. Most 2 handed European swords are where designed so that they where capable of cutting, but stabbing was much more effective against armor. Stabbing is possible with a tanto blade, but a lot less effective that a fine point is what you would get with something like a longsword. This is also a reason why halfswording or the murderstroke became common techniques. This would not be possible with a Japanese style guard, which where not intended to guard from attacks as much as from your hand sliding up.

Material means a lot, or we would still be using iron. The differences can be mitigated through refinement and forging technique and are often exaggerated. This is why Japanese Smith had to use differential hardness and folding. They managed to make really nice weapons out of what they had, but if you used a Katana like you would want to use a long swords, it would chip badly and fail at doing what the user wants.

To be clear, I like Japanese style weapons and respect what they hand to think of in order to get what they needed. I prefer European swords due to having a preference, and that gives me a little bias. I might have been a little rude, and I am sorry. I felt that you where making the issue more black and white than it actually is, which is a large problem when it comes to discussing stuff like firearms or swords and knives.

You will generally favour one or two over the others in certain situations (a splitting axe does not need to keep a nice edge for example).

European steels suffered more damage because of how they where used. Blade on blade or blade on metal armor contact was much more common. Traditional Japanese swords where often too hard to make up for the quality of metal, so would chip under what European swords where expected to do. You can sharpen out knics, you can't do the same with a chip or crack."

No, the edge is hardened to the point of being quite brittle due to the ore quality and the level they where able to refine it to. The rest of the blade is covered in clay so as to not get as hard. This makes it so that the blade does not snap when pressure is applied and ends up giving the curve due to different rates of cooling. While the curve helps with slicing, it's not that much.
