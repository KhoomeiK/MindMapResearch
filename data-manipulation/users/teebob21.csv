In comparison to other existing technologies, current nuclear fission power is the best we have. Is there waste? Yes, and it's nasty stuff! The ""good"" part about high-level radioactive waste is that it's full of energy and ""could"" be repurposed for additional electricity, proliferation concerns aside. Nuclear is the absolute best option for baseline generation in the next 100 years.
