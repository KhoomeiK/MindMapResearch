Fitness,ffilcxq,t1_ffiihon,1579976635.0,"I haven’t thought about an official budget. It’s $10 a month for the cheapest gym in the area, (planet fitness) which I’m assuming will have good enough equipment. It’ll be about $15-$20 or so in gas money per trip, if I’m estimating properly. On weekends I can pretty much go for as long as I want at any time of day. During the week I usually wouldn’t be able to get to the gym until 6pm, which would have me getting home around 8pm, which as good for me as that may be, sounds very unappealing. I’d rather not be away from my house for over 12 hours at a time, I’m such a homebody."
Fitness,ffihrk0,t3_etp1th,1579974172.0,"Is a gym membership worth it if I only go once a week?

I (23F) recently moved to a small town and also recently got into fitness. I’m very much a beginner. I wasn’t crazy out of shape before, but I’ve never really done any extensive workout programs or ever lifted. Right now I’m doing daily workouts at home using body weight and some light dumbbells. I kinda miss running, but the gym closest to my little town is 45 minutes away, and seeing as I’m usually at work ten hours a day,  and then take work home on top of that, I have a hard tome convincing myself I have the time (and gas money) to add an hour and a half of driving to my schedule multiple times a week.

I was thinking maybe I’d get a membership so I could do cardio + a full body weight routine once a month, but I’d that even worth my money? Or should I just keep working out at home? And is it crazy to try to do cardio and weights in the same day?"

Teachers,fffo9sq,t1_fffkimq,1579888226.0,"I didn’t give them a 0, I gave them a 50% which was till being generous honestly. Everything is a behavior. You can’t not give consequences for cheating because it’s a behavior."
Teachers,fffnz36,t1_ffem3i5,1579888047.0,"Should we take off points when kids fight? No, they’re assignment wasn’t to not fight. But the assignment was to write original work so I’m taking points off for that. If a student googled all the answers for a history test would you still give them credit even though they cheated?"
Teachers,fffk6r7,t1_ffdtwng,1579885732.0,"Gave them a chance to redo for a finished score but they didn’t do it by the tome grades were due. I’m not grading on behavior, I’m grading them on THEIR work. Less than half of it was theirs, the rest was blatant plagiarism and I can’t grade something that was stolen."
bulletjournal,ffdtpnu,t3_eszdae,1579828686.0,Whoah those little bubbles are so cool! Did you just use regular markers? I love how the colors overlap and make them look transparent
