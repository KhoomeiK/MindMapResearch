If you had to be able to pay for the insurance on the worst possible outcome of any endeavour you undertook, for any endeavour you undertook, most people wouldn't do anything, because life is dangerous. We pay insurance largely for only the most expensive, dangerous things we do. Like driving a car, or working seriously dangerous jobs. Or when the value vs. risk ratio is enormous, like renting an apartment with valuables worth more than the building inside. We don't take out friendship insurance just because our best friend could become suicidal and then maybe homicidal. There are simply things that aren't worth insuring. Like love, or friendship, or having a pet.

I'm not saying you should have a pet if you are totally incapable of taking care of it, or that pet insurance is bad, if you can swing it.

Trump is certainly criminal (I am no democrat; not only is the supporting evidence overwhelming, the fact is simply... evident.) Standing behind such corruption, especially at as high a level as the presidency, *is* corruption.

So, all senators and representatives who stand behind Trump are complicit in his crimes. The Republican party of the right now, if not already, is at serious risk of becoming a party without ideal or merit. Just a machine dedicated to ""offending the libs.""

While without ideal, they do have desired ends (I'll desire your end); mostly centered around keeping the rich wealthy, and stripping every last bit of dignity and opportunity from anyone of the working class or lower.

HumansAreMetal,felmd3h,t1_felb7ex,1579225625.0,"I'm not disagreeing with you, per se, but what is the point of categorization if anything is everything?

This is very impressive, but is it metal? I've listened to metal for 26 years and I certainly wouldn't say this embodies what it means for something to embody the metal aesthetic. Obviously a matter of opinion, BUT!...

We make categories so that we can place things in conceptual bins. It's a useful thing, and we naturally do it as humans. Everytime someone thinks *x* is not in said bin, someone cries ""r/gatekeeping"" and is usually applauded... why? Is everything anything? I don't think so.

Some things are metal. Some things are not. Demons, fairies, trolls, murder, coldness, mountains, combat boots. Those are metal. Beaches, cooing babies, crossfit, cottonballs, and flowers are not (unless there is further context, like ritual sacrifice on a beach, or eating cooing babies, or doing crossfit so as to be best suited to drink the blood of your enemies. That's metal) Am I gatekeeping by pointing it out? Maybe. I don't think so though. 

Gatekeeping would be if I said women can't make metal. Gatekeeping would be if I said you can't make metal if you do crossfit, or like flowers. Those things aren't metal, but liking them doesn't make it so that you yourself cannot have feelings best expressed through metal. Anyone can have feelings suited to metal.

Anyhow, categorization is useful, but a large chunk of the internet cries fowl when someone disagrees with your categorization. Just because someone has the nuts to disagree with reddit's hivemind doesn't make them ""gatekeepers."" 

They have an opinion, and it's as valid as yours. He stated it like a dick, but that is not what has been addressed. 

I'm sure this wont go over well, but I seriously think people should consider what I've said. Stating *x* is not *y* is not inherently gatekeeping.

(Just to state, I live in a small rural area where I might have to walk a half mile in the wrong direction to get to a signaled crossing. It isn't always an option, though I always use them when available.)"

I've been wrong before, so, again, you may certainly be right."
rareinsults,feildaw,t1_feikxhs,1579141230.0,"That was not my purpose. I don't care about pornography. 

Please leave me alone."
IncelTears,feikjgn,t3_ep8xvj,1579140672.0,"I disagree with this post entirely. 

Lots of people's pain and depression is pathological and not solvable by ""helping their communities"" or what have you. Many people suffer serious mental illness which causes them to feel disdain towards the world, as well as general hopelessness. There is nothing incel about suffering: depression, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, antisocial personality disorder, bipolar depression, et cetera.

Shaming the mentally Ill is not helpful. We need to normalize these folks, rather than shun them. They are everywhere and most of them are trying awfully hard just to make it.

OP should be ashamed."
confusing_perspective,feije8a,t1_fehh45q,1579139898.0,I can't see it at all. Just looks like a kayak on someone's lawn to me.
rareinsults,feiii5x,t1_feige6z,1579139313.0,"Sorry, I dont know porn actors by name (other than, like, john holmes.) What I meant was it is perfectly discoverable yourself, as you have done."
lotrmemes,feih1em,t1_feif5dr,1579138347.0,"Animated one is great. I like the movies too. The cgi is way too much and lacks the charming nature of the practical effects PJ is known for. I still like it though. Regardless, the animated hobbit movie is absolutely ""creditable."""
rareinsults,feifvsv,t1_feiakk2,1579137571.0,Google any of the (likely unique) strings in the exchange and you will find it is indeed her (suspended) Twitter account that made the comment.
rareinsults,feifr2j,t1_feido8u,1579137483.0,You forget that many people lack even the most basic google-fu. It's a skill many of us take for granted.
facepalm,fefo3gx,t1_feephxq,1579060597.0,"Everytime I hear a conspiracy theory espoused in earnest from someone, as well as admitting that they do in fact happen once in a while (for example Tuskegee), I ask: ""how good is the average person, or even the best imaginable person, at keeping secrets?"" I think most of us would say from experience ""not very good.""

It's worth thinking about, regardless of who you are. Any theory requiring many people to keep a juicy secret is at least questionable by this human tendency alone."

nfl,fe67zvx,t3_env82r,1578883806.0,"To the whole of seattle... get fucked. You deserve to lose! You are known for hitting other players such that they are unable to play. You deserve this. You hurt people on purpose in order to win! That's dirty! You're dirty! You need to come to terms with what you are! You are a dirty football team! You play dirty, you hit dirty... you want opposing players to be hurt! That's what your team does! THAT'S WHO YOU ARE!"
nfl,fe677ry,t3_env82r,1578883343.0,I got downvoted and I don't care. Pete Carroll is known for hitting dirty. Seattle seeks to take players put of the game. Dirty team. They dont belong in the league and they shouldn't be playing. Seattle doesn't beat philly without murdering the philly quarterback. Everyone thinks they know shit... but they don't. Most teams dont hurt players on purpose. Seriously! I respect most teams and don't feel like a hit changed the game!
nfl,fe66jq9,t1_fe660sd,1578882912.0,Are you joking? Have you watched him the last 2 weeks? He is trying to injure. Trying to kill even. He wants to remove players from the game.
nfl,fe66d1b,t1_fe65ban,1578882795.0,I actually am well used to crying. I've suffered a lot in this life. More than many understand.  My dad died when I was 18. My brother shot himself when I was 5. My parents divorced when I was 6. My grandad died when I was 8. My mom died when i was 12. Do you get off on other people's suffering?  Why do you celebrate peoples pain? I usually root for the people around me. I want the people i know to be happy. But I suppose I'm also a generally kind person.
nfl,fe65qtg,t1_fe65lbo,1578882400.0,Is dirty. Yes. Seeks to hurt coworkers. Famous for it in fact.
nfl,fe65kpz,t1_fe65fzi,1578882290.0,Clowney is a headhunting moron who doesn't belong in the league. If you want to hurt your coworkers go into wrestling or something.

nfl,fe649va,t1_fe643k7,1578881455.0,"They injure opposing players, so you've already seen Seattle up to their level. It's easy to look good if you take out opposing playmakers."
nfl,fe642g3,t1_fe61j2h,1578881319.0,Wentz was taken out as a target. I have no doubt about it.
