I'm not a psychology major but when I took my psychology class in college for my Associates my professor said it has to do with you. You attract these kinds of people in your life. You do it without realizing it.

Not saying it is your fault but understanding red flags. I know there is a saying of ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" but how a person dresses and body language tells a lot about a person before anything is spoken. If you learn these things you could prevent people who do weird shit like this in your life. Not everyone is self aware of what they are doing to others but you seem like a smart woman that can avoid these things if you put your mind to it. How old are you? You sound like someone in their teens or early 20's."
offmychest,fewq6ks,t1_fen1f97,1579417836.0,"Focus on the thing you can do right now instead of what you have to do in the future. You will stop feeling overwhelmed when you do the small stuff each day.

Just like if you have the long list of things to do. Instead of looking at that long list just break up that list of things.

The thing about time is we all end up at the same place and I know you want to get someplace in your life that makes you happy but no matter how much you worry about time it never stops. Just let time happen and focus on the here and now."
AskMen,fel1end,t1_fel0tdm,1579211971.0,"No because they consider it a ""red flag"" which makes no sense."
residentevil,fekvr7f,t1_fektfa8,1579208604.0,Or not because I never played Resident Evil 2 and 3. I also never liked the tank controls. I played Resident Evil 1 and honestly if they made a remake for that one with the gameplay of Resident Evil 2 remake and 3 remake I would buy it in a instant.
offmychest,fekup2e,t3_epndfj,1579207977.0,"Then you realize it doesn't matter and you just coast through life enjoying the small things instead of worrying about every little thing that is wrong or could go wrong. I am probably going to get fired from my job for being sick because they want a doctors note except I don't have health insurance. Lol. America is funny. People lack empathy here yet they want it when it happens to them.

I could sit all day and just make myself sick or I just say, ""Hey I could always just find another job. If that doesn't work out then try another until one hits! Sure I might have to buy ramen until it happens but at least I am still alive.""

I might get in a fight and lose but if I am still alive I still call that a win but I will train until I learn to win fights because I am still alive. Just like right now, you can learn on how to do all of the things you complain about because you are still alive.

Getting your life together takes time, money, and resources so don't hurt yourself to hard in your head because all of that takes time. You aren't going to be skinny in a minute or an hour. It takes months, years. Hell just learning it might take you a month but if you keep working at it and figuring out what is and isn't working you will get there."

Wait nevermind I forgot nintendo games never get priced slashed."
residentevil,fej4443,t1_feie6ju,1579156167.0,I can't wait until I start working at a hospital even though I hate them.
IdiotsInCars,feiskg5,t1_fehnqy0,1579146122.0,In some states it isn't illegal to ride on the side walk.
