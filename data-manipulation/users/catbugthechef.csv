The easy reply on drugs is you dont know how they work, well guess what the medical world even knows less how their medication works. Even their own fda approvals barely manage to go over placebo, yet have the worst side effects imaginable.
You have no idea how outdated many of the drugs are. Many are designed and tested during ww2 and still nothing is known about them.

Try visiting a psychologist to get a total explanation of how you can recognise the first symptoms. Its a slow process and it takes a Hile before the outside world notices the changes and gets the link to schizophrenia. If you get help during the first phase it can help you alot.

Let your doctor put it in your medical file that you are at risk so it gets noticed faster if anything is wrong.

Stress is a big trigger. Be aware of what gives you stress and find something that gives you rest.

Build a social network of friends and family, you might need them later when you do get sick. Only disclose it to people you realy trust though, mentioning the illness means crazy for some people and you might lose them over nothing.

As others stated drugs are an extra risk. Especially weed is mentioned with schizophrenia. Although i have never found any trustworthy evidence. 

Dont let it control your life just yet, you have a slightly bigger genetic probability to get it later on. Thats a small statistical chance, not a 100% certainty. Many other factors come into play.
Enjoy life.
I dont have schizophrenia myself and am not a doctor either, do your own research and go from there."

And even for such a so called progressive country the battle to get the recognition was just surreal.
I went to seek help again for severe depression.
Therapy wouldnt help so the medications kept escalating and i was jospitalised. It became so hard on me that i just pulled on all brakes at the end and started the procedure for euthanasia. This made the doctors finaly listen to what i had to say. I got another testresult wich said SPD, wich i thought was bs by reading the wiki. But at least now the doctors werent as agressive in their treatment. 

Meanwhile time passed and after a year my case automatically switched to disability on terms of depression. 

Every 6 months i have to go to a control doctor who evaluates my case. He leaves me be for now but i know in the end he will think im lazy and will want me to get agressivly treated for my depression i dont have. He already mentioned ECT. So for now im good but someday my disability will probably have terms and conditions wich gives me a bit of anxiety.
