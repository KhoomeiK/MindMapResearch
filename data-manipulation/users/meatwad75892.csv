One difference is that we're not using Microsoft MFA, but instead enforcing Duo with a Conditional Access policy.  So it's still leveraging Modern Auth & tokens, but the token refresh process is going to be slightly different.

Do you have jobs? Are you supposed to keep friends that long in the afterlife? Is heaven filled with 100 billion souls of people from different eras of human history? Is it segregated because no one knows how to talk to the cavemen? Does God sort of Matrix-style catch everyone up to speed with knowledge and language?

I can't say I've had any unexplained timeouts with Duo in the several years that we've had it available. (Outside of rare known outages that are cleared up within an hour or two)  Anytime I've seen or heard of weirdness from others, it usually boils down to either A) aggressive Android battery optimization messing with the Duo app, or B) approving Duo pushes from a lockscreen notification, but the phone is locked. I see ""B"" happen occasionally on my phone if Smart Lock wigs out, and I know it happens because the Duo push notification on my watch will tell me to go open the app on my phone instead. The second I unlocked the phone, the push approval goes on through.


If you're ever in a bind, you can always cancel a push attempt, and enter a code instead. In the Duo app, tap on your MSU account and it will give you a 6-digit code to use in lieu of using Duo Push.


For the restore part, that should be expected.  The nature of MFA is that your authenticator holds a secret key that is the basis of your generated codes and the pushes you receive. iOS and Android both should not retain this secret key when they back up the application data to their respective services.  There is also the Duo Restore feature built into Duo, but I don't really have any experience trying that out. So that feature may very well be wonky for all I know.


If anyone plans on getting a new phone, they should ideally set up their new one before wiping or getting rid of the old one so that you can still complete an MFA challenge and get into your Duo settings and enroll the new device.  If that is not possible (lost device, wiped old device before setting up new device, etc) you can always generate a one-time bypass code at https://2fa.msstate.edu by entering your netPassword, birthday, and SSN or MSU ID. You can use this to get into your Duo settings and enroll a new device, no visit or call to the Service Desk required.


You are correct, we don't enable the option to let users use SMS, calls, or software TOTP so that they can generate codes in any authenticator app. But if you do want an alternate method of completing MFA challenges, you can get an OATH HOTP token (YubiKey, et al) and the Service Desk will gladly link it to your Duo account.  It's nice to know that if you forget your phone for a day, you can keep a YubiKey on your keychain and not have to fiddle with one-time bypass codes for a whole day.


As for Microsoft Authenticator-- I would doubt this happens. Microsoft MFA that is natively included with O365 works great, but it would take a separate product (Azure MFA Server) to integrate into the multitude of applications and services we have on campus.  I don't see this being cheaper than Duo for us."

There is no tenant-side option to not deploy this feature, and O365 cloud-based configuration policies that could reach these unmanaged devices do not contain a payload to prevent the extension's installation. We have absolutely **zero** recourse to prevent thousands upon thousands of our users' personal devices' Chrome settings from getting hijacked against their will. Unless they backtrack on this, or give us tenant-side toggles or updated cloud-based config policies to prevent the installation on unmanaged devices, there will be countless help desk hours spent fielding complaints and hearing earfuls about the change.

Office365,ffghe0a,t1_fffyzc8,1579906276.0,"On the security thing... What specific concern about security? Because it's not inherently insecure, quite the opposite really. Do you have other company-approved storage options or services being offered and made known to users? If so, I'd be less concerned about keeping OneDrive for Business away from them. But if not, consider the following:


If users are blocked from one product (OneDrive for Business) in a suite of services (O365) that are already being deployed, all that will do is encourage them to look elsewhere to do the things they want to do.  If that ""thing"" is cloud storage and they have no other company-supported options, congratulations...  Your users may now be tossing sensitive company data into personal OneDrive accounts, iCloud, Google Drive, etc. that you have zero administrative control over.  You can't audit the contents. You can't eDiscover against the files. You have zero say over how secure the user's password is on that service. They don't have to use MFA. They can potentially store malicious files.



But, if you deploy and support OneDrive for Business, the opposite of all the above is true.   You can audit & eDiscover to your heart's content. You can set DLP policies to prevent certain data from leaving or coming in.  Accounts are protected by password policies and MFA that *you* implement and manage.

Office365,fffzwx3,t1_fffytuf,1579895452.0,"Well Office Online requires storing files somewhere in SharePoint Online, be it OneDrive for Business (default for new docs), or a shared file/library from another user or SharePoint site. (Standalone or from O365 Groups)

Office365,fff8ckb,t1_fff7k2s,1579878246.0,"Not sure, unfortunately.  Our org jumped from ""no one gets OneDrive"" to ""everyone gets OneDrive"", so didn't get a chance for trial & error on that matter."
Office365,fff6y0c,t3_etb1ge,1579877272.0,"The option we took years ago was changing the default **Create Personal Site** permission in SharePoint Online that the link describes. If you remove ""everyone except external users"", then OneDrive for Business personal sites will not provision for users, even if they get a SharePoint Online license. Worked great.


Beyond that, it's always easy to revert or scale up from there. If you only want a select number of people to get OneDrive, put them all in a security group and add the security group to the Create Personal Site permission in SharePoint. Or if you want the whole org to get OneDrive, just add ""everyone except external users"" back into the permission as is default.


Note that this is a method for preventing OneDrive provisioning in the first place.  If users already have OneDrive and you want to take it away after the fact, you'll need to revoke their permission to their personal site in SharePoint.  As the link above mentioned, removing a user's SharePoint Online license doesn't actually make their access to OneDrive completely inaccessible.


Lastly, I'd make sure you really have someone in management backing the decision to do this.  If you're not using many other O365 services like Teams, then you probably won't hear much fuss over not having OneDrive. But if you prevent OneDrive but give users all the other services, you'll find many pain points-- No Office Online, no Teams file sharing, etc."

I have a Premier case open where Microsoft confirmed this finally after like two or three months, but no ETA on a fix.


If this isn't the case, how are you giving permissions to said calendar? Direct full mailbox access?  Direct or group-based folder-level calendar permissions?   And is it reproducible on Outlook on the Web, Outlook on macOS, etc?"

That said, it's after 2pm on a Friday, so I don't think you'd have much luck on availability. If your usual dentist can work you in Monday, maybe just stick with your dentist.

sysadmin,fcy0d7f,t1_fcxpmap,1578072935.0,"We've been doing the same thing since moving from Groupwise to Exchange 2013 back in 2014. (University, also we're now on Exchange Online) We have a little over 1,000 shared mailboxes and just under 300 resources, so auditing that would be a headache if not for using security groups for mailbox access.  We can just query group memberships or the memberships of a specific user, instead of combing through every mailbox permission in our tenant and hoping it doesn't timeout.


Not automapping is actually a desired feature for us.  Many users don't want all their things visible & caching into their .ost at all times, they just browse through the mailbox as needed using Outlook on the Web.


The only catch we've had with group-based access has been pretty recent.  On any client using their newer calendar sync APIs (Outlook mobile, *new* Outlook on the Web, Outlook on macOS), it currently doesn't honor group-based full access for a shared mailboxes' calendar. It fails to process the permission, and only shows the org default, usually free/busy.  We opened a Premier case two months ago, it got escalated 6 times, and they finally admitted it was a bug and they can reproduce it, and that it will be fixed at some point in the future. No ETA, but they scheduled a follow-up call for this month.  The workaround in the meantime is to just give the group folder-level calendar permissions."

Encrypted storage's unlock PIN can be exploited, but I imagine it'd make slightly tougher work out of brute-forcing your way physically into a phone too depending on the case.


I'm not sure why you have to gloat and insinuate I'm dumb either. (I'm an admin, deploying MFA across services is one of my duties) I'm not arguing that physically accessible devices aren't a weak point in people's digital security that can be easily compromised.  I'm saying that 2FA is not pointless, and the existence of physical exploits against devices isn't some grand argument against 2FA."
YouShouldKnow,fcvedzp,t1_fctqkfs,1578000351.0,"Yes indeed! When adding TOTP accounts into any authenticator, it's a good idea to grab the secret key (both plain text & screenshot of the QR code) and keep them secure in an *encrypted* file with with a *long non-recycled password*, be it a Keepass database or BitLocker'd virtual disk or whatever. (Lest you have all your secret keys in an easy-to-compromise single place)


Makes restoring your 2FA tokens as easy as scanning a handful of codes in a matter of a minute or so.   Doesn't require having the old device on hand, and doesn't require spending an hour re-enrolling in 2FA everywhere."
YouShouldKnow,fcvb2ps,t1_fcued3c,1577998376.0,"For what it's worth, many phones have options to impose increasingly longer lockouts upon unsuccessful PIN entries, some with the option to wipe the device after [x] unsuccessful tries. Subverting 2FA in this manner is a weakness in users' habits, not a flaw in 2FA itself, as you've stated.  All of these worst-case scenarios could be mitigated by better security habits-- configuring PIN lockouts, using longer PINs, being familiar with your remote-wiping options in the event that your phone is lost or stolen, not using SMS-based 2FA, securing lockscreen notifications if you must use SMS-based 2FA for lack of any other option, etc etc.


Example-- Just this past weekend my fiancee forgot her phone in an Uber. We logged her into Google's Find My Device using a 2FA backup code she keeps discretely & unlabeled in her wallet. We were ready to wipe her device at any moment if necessary.. Not that it would have been immediately necessary, because she has a decent 6-digit PIN and it starts locking you out after just a few failures.


But anyway, for the above reasons, 2FA is not all smoke and mirrors. In the context of losing a phone it can be worked around with minimal effort depending on circumstances, sure... But when up against remote adversaries that can log into web-based services with compromised credentials from anywhere in the world, it's a necessity, and very secure if done correctly."
