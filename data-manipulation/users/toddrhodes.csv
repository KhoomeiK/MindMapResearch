vinyl,ffe8ga2,t1_ffe85n8,1579839551.0,I'm unfortunately not familiar at all with GG but will check out some of your suggestions. Just so we're clear - skip the SW remixes of GG albums?
interstellar,ffe85et,t1_ffdi5xs,1579839306.0,"I'm glad I'm not the only one that gets a little annoyed with that scene. His last name is Cooper, so with no context, his assumption really isn't that silly. But you'd think he just took credit for all of it in one fell swoop. Though I do appreciate the humor of it, as mentioned already."
vinyl,ffe7ltm,t3_et4zw4,1579838866.0,"Of any current artist, I would say Steven Wilson is one I simply wish more people were familiar with. His remixes and remasters have taken old albums and revitalized them. His musicianship, songwriting is, in my opinion, unimpeachable. My favorite concept album is without a doubt Hand. Cannot. Erase. His contributions to Opeth and Porcupine Tree are indisputably good and elevated both bands. 

This is Transience, which is basically an anthology."
vinyl,ffcmacp,t1_ffcf07l,1579802468.0,I can confirm By The Way sounds really good on vinyl. Better to my ears and my taste than the CD. I only bought it for sentimental value since it's my favorite RHCP but had no expectations for it to sound decent. I was very pleasantly surprised by it.
vinyl,ffcblx7,t1_ffc2k0j,1579795929.0,"About an hour ago on a forum, Jason Stoddard of Schiit confirmed that Sol will be ""back"" in February. It's coming :)"
vinyl,ffbbm4b,t1_ffb7biz,1579758673.0,"No argument here my friend. I am fortunate to have a couple local friends who are also SMC fans, so I was able to hear what his equipment could do, and also get a feeling for how he was to interact with. I will say, Steve McCormack, Keith Herron, and George Merrill are, without a doubt, true audio geniuses as well as stewards for this hobby. They love music, and they are exceptional at making hardware worth a darn. We're lucky to count them among our peers :)"
vinyl,ffbadb0,t1_ffb9ge5,1579757278.0,I do not. Any recommendations I should check out?
vinyl,ffb6yf0,t1_ffb6uvn,1579753455.0,"I left out something kinda cool about the PhonoDrive - if you only had one other source feeding into it, you could also use it as a full, active line stage. It has space for an additional input of your choosing."
vinyl,ffb6uvn,t1_ffb5o6q,1579753379.0,"So when it arrived, it didn't work. It turned on, but wouldn't output any sound beyond some weird fizzles and pops. To be clear, I bought it on eBay in ""working, tested fine"" condition. I paid $350 for it (more on that in a sec). I called out to SMC audio and the lads out there helped me to pinpoint the issue. I'm not an electronics tech but essentially there was a rather critical transistor which was no longer connected to the chassis. This is important because this particular phono pre is essentially an ""oven."" And the transistor that wasn't making contact with the heatsink is the burner for that oven, among other things. So I jerry-rigged it, and got sound out of it. Then with SMC's help I fixed it formally. SMC doesn't work on them anymore but offered all the docs and schematics for a local repair place if I needed.

Anyway - that's a lot to say that for the $350 I spent and the bit of aggravation I went through? It's a wonderful phono preamp. Of any component in my setup, I've tried the most phono stages. I just like hearing how they are all so different. Best I've had was a Herron VTPH-2. The Mod Squad one is so eerily similar - transparent, tons of drive and slam, very musical aka foot tapping, and quiet. Like the Herron, it just seems to get out of the way. I honestly couldn't ask for more performance for what I spent.

I'm also using an RLD-1 line stage and have a DNA-125 out at SMC Audio right now, getting close to being up to bat for a few upgrades. I've talked to Steve once so far and he is as described - absolutely approachable and a joy to work with. His compatriots out there at SMC are, so far as I've talked to, a blast to talk gear or music with. Very cool folks, ambassadors of hifi, in my opinion."
vinyl,ffb5jrk,t3_eskm5s,1579752367.0,"My intro to Rise Against was a Need For Speed game. Underground, maybe? Either way, great band and sweet collection!"
vinyl,ffay9mm,t3_esmr4l,1579747280.0,"This one joins Bythe Way, Mother's Milk, and Stadium Arcadium in my RHCP vinyl collection. This is an album that I think will really benefit from a true vinyl master and so far, so good. Bellman cut and pressed at Pallas USA, which usually never disappoints. I will say though, if you happen to stumble upon a original of Mother's Milk, buy it. It's a fantastic album on vinyl but I had the reissue and it was kinda meh. RHCP seems to be one to definitely research the pressing before buying."
vinyl,ff9zkvb,t1_ff9z27y,1579724869.0,"I hear ya. And yea, the 30th is awesome but some copies were pressed badly, or at least that's what I've read. My copy is fine, thankfully.

On Elton - I have that same GYBR and it's good, but not great condition (VG+ I'm guessing, on that scale). But if you see one out in the wild or on discogs, there is a 45 RPM 12"" single for Funeral For a Friend. Grab it if it's cheap - it's stunning when it has that much room to breathe on a side."
vinyl,ff9sh7d,t1_ff8gay3,1579720254.0,"Thanks! It's a Schiit Sol with an 11"" carbon fiber arm, Naga MP-200 cart"
vinyl,ff9s8y3,t1_ff9l1cu,1579720089.0,"I will say that finding one in NM is tough. My copy looks NM and was play graded really well by a discogs seller but honestly, UK vinyl of this vintage is just somewhat noisy. I've seen it on old Queen, Elton, and PF early UK pressings. Either way, good luck! I'm sure I have a reply or two in that thread you linked. I wouldn't expect b3 to be better than b2, they are very likely the same or only very subtly different. But a2 did have an issue early on (from memory) so a3 is actually a better pressing on that side."
Vinyl_Jazz,ff9rwsa,t1_ff9pc5y,1579719839.0,"Thanks! It's a Schiit Sol. Really enjoying the sound it makes. I've got a review of it over in r/audiophile if you fancy a look (sorry, don't have that link handy but I can get it if you'd like)"
heavyvinyl,ff9rs11,t1_ff9f8ay,1579719739.0,"Nice! I grabbed one from Amazon for 32, but it won't be here for a few weeks. Figures :) hope someone else nabs that copy!"
vinyl,ff8yqxh,t1_ff8j8ez,1579700326.0,"ID? Are you talking about the discogs entry or stamper numbers? The stamper/matrix info is A3/B2. A first press would be A2/B2 and would have the light blue triangle on the label. I used to know this stuff by heart but it's been a little bit :)  

If you're looking for the discogs entry, let me know, I can pull that up if that's easier :)"
vinyl,ff82o3u,t3_es68de,1579664391.0,"This is a very early UK pressing of Dark Side of the Moon. I know these are a dime a dozen, but not this version. Early tape, and the sound on this one is unlike any of the versions of this album I've tried. Can't really explain it but there's just ""extra"" in this thing. Anyway, I do love the album, in my opinion music was not the same after this came out. And this copy has the very best second side, combined with the ""fix"" of the first press first side. If I remember right, something was wrong during Time on early first pressings. A neat bit of history on this one. Thanks for looking."
audiophile,ff78t3m,t3_erw31b,1579643386.0,No idea but I got Anne's digits now. Gonna see what's up for this weekend.
interstellar,ff75w9m,t1_ff6dycp,1579641746.0,"I agree. But at the same time, the score would still be pretty, but without context in the movie, it wouldn't be as substantial as it is either. But the two together? Beautiful art, at least in my mind."
interstellar,ff75i3g,t3_es17y0,1579641523.0,"Am I the only one who, every time this scene comes up, tries to find Mann, or little chunks of Mann, flying around in space? Not to sound insensitive, but I think he got what he deserved. And, I've yet to find any semblance of Mann debris. Rest assured, I'll keep looking. Edit - maybe if I had a 4k set. Hmmm.

Vinyl_Jazz,ff4yv0w,t1_ff4yiu4,1579575759.0,"If I remember right, I was able to pick this one up around Christmas of '18 and AP was having a really nice sale - got 3 or 4 records that time. I bought some MMJ albums over the weekend and was upset this one was sold out, but thought i might already have a copy. Turns out I do, and I don't hear anything about it I'd want as an improvement. I'm sure that Classic 33 is amazing."
Vinyl_Jazz,ff4yps0,t3_erocee,1579575658.0,"First post in here. I've posted over in r/vinyl several times and honestly didn't know about this sub until earlier today. Not sure how odd a pairing this is but my main three genres to listen to are: Metal (death, black, melodic, progressive), Jazz, and probably film scores/game scores performed by symphonies, or just the scores themselves if no symphonic interpretation exists. In metal, especially - I focus on the instrumentation. Vocals are merely an instrument. Very, very few of my favorites are so due to vocals and lyrics. 

So I think it was pretty natural for me to get into Jazz a little more as I grew up, but having made some changes to my stereo and having tried some things lately with gear - the ""realism"" of jazz has really become sort of startling to me. I am fortunate to have good pressings of several classics, with a few more on the way. I'll share what I'm listening to but at this point, I really don't speak the language of jazz. Not yet, not sure I'll ever fully get there, but I'm starting to pick up on at least a few performers and instruments that really hit me a certain way.

So anyway, thanks for having me!"

I think one holdup has been the go/no-go decision on setting everything up at Schiit, prior to shipment, if the Sol is purchased with a cartridge.

audiophile,fepeao5,t1_fepcx04,1579318370.0,"I have Dynaudio Focus 260 speakers. They're a little finicky with placement but not too terrible. Diffusion on front and side walls, rear corner bass trap, small room. One thing that helps with these is the first order crossovers, which for a passive speaker setup, can help eliminate timing and phase issues. They also have a very narrow front baffle, and I believe that also helps them ""disappear"" a bit."

It can be done but it takes a lot of things to make it happen. I'm not saying every speaker in every room can do it. Standmounts, I think, have an easier time with this since they have less ""face"" to reflect oddly.

I heard a system in a strip mall in Omaha where, without doubt, it felt like you could walk up between the speakers and measure the distance between the tom and the cymbal on the drum kit. It was incredible. It was also incredibly expensive, but definitely eye-opening. Speakers were Rockport, and they were boxes, not planars. Setup, room treatment and design - those are the most important factors here. But I do believe planars are either hit or miss in this regard. But, once they ""hit"" they are almost lifelike."

audiophile,fenlzwb,t1_fenlmh1,1579287546.0,"I see where you're going. From an industrial design perspective, Schiit is minimalist. Not flashy. I can find or take some other pics of it if you want to see some other angles, certainly. I think putting it up on the ""pucks"" that I'm using, helps it sort of stand out.

Now, what I can tell you - EVERYONE asks about it. I post in quite a few FB groups and in vinyl/heavyvinyl here and I can't remember a single post of mine where someone didn't ask about it. Most times wanting just to know more about it, but it does catch the eye. I had a little of that with the PolyTable as well since it also looks very unique, but it is also very muted, very utilitarian in design. So I think Sol is more eye catching, however I don't think anyone would walk up on it and suspect it's a $5k+ table. Even the arm - it's absolutely amazing, but it's simple. Being carbon fiber helps from the aesthetic side, but it also makes for a very capable musical instrument, which a tonearm really is. So I think Sol rides a pretty unique line here. It's presence belies its price, but it's not so over the top that it seems extravagant."
audiophile,fenl6pb,t1_fenl0kc,1579287050.0,"My apologies - the PolyTable is still the superior table. It's not a debate, but for what I paid for Sol, and what I'd have to invest to get the Super 12 back? That's what I don't miss :) Don't get me wrong - my endgame table is still his topend table. I forget what it's called, but if I can afford it ten years from now and one happens to pop up on the used market? It'll be mine. Sol is good, but it's not THAT good. George also happens to be one of the nicest people I've interacted with in Audio. A true gem, no pun intended.

&#x200B;

And indeed, it is high praise for Sol but I also intended that to be a compliment to the PolyTable, but re-reading it, I could have been way more clear on that point. It's my reference, full stop."
audiophile,fen2iah,t3_epuasp,1579275519.0,"Wanted to note something important - Schiit has addressed a concern that I raised in a comment on here (not because of the comment, but just in general) for people new to vinyl who are buying a first or second turntable and who are neither comfortable with, or knowledgeable about some of the setup options Sol offers. If purchased with a cartridge, Schiit will setup the table and cart at the factory, prior to shipping. That will be a much more ""plug and play"" experience for those use cases."
audiophile,fen2672,t1_fen1rlj,1579275305.0,"I think the most frustrating initial flaw was the original headshell - it just didn't give enough travel and space for some carts, to align them without bending or compromising the connection pins. They fixed that fairly quickly.

But the speed thing - I think Schiit really wanted to nail the speed, W/F, AND auto start. And ultimately to do all of those, was going to add expense and re-engineering to just about everything - platter, bearing, and motor. So I think it came down to - is auto-start a must have? At this price point, for what you're getting in performance? I think they made the right call that it is in fact not a dealbreaker. And to be clear - this isn't a turntable for newbies, for beginners who are just learning about vinyl. Despite it's simplicity, it is very flexible and thus, could be intimidating with its learning curve for inexperienced setup folks.

So I think that was the crux - could they satisfy the speed and W/F requirements, without added cost and re-work and the answer was yes, but users have to nudge the platter to get it going, and from there it's fine.

I put about 4 records through it last night and by the 3rd one, the ""nudge"" was muscle memory. No big deal, and I cannot overstate how happy I am with the sound.

&#x200B;

Edit - and I'll break this out into a separate comment. But on my thoughts about a table for beginners - Schiit has apparently addressed that by ""pre-setting"" the table at the factory when it is bought with a cartridge. That will make it MUCH more friendly to those new, or just getting into vinyl or upgrading from a much simpler setup for the first time."
FallOutBoy,femry5s,t1_fem5cnv,1579267890.0,"Thanks for sharing that, I totally get it. My album like that was Ride the Lightning by Metallica.

FallOutBoy,femro14,t1_femrej4,1579267655.0,"I think I'll pick up that HT version and see how it goes. I can see that the one I have (2016 reissue) uses the same mastering as the Hot Topic, and probably the Pic Disc, but the 2016 pressing just leaves a little to be desired. Frankly if I was just a casual fan of this album, what I have would be completely fine. But I adore this thing, and want a very clean, sharp copy of it. Is what it is :)

And also being a fan of Tool - Lateralus, which is only on vinyl in Pic Disc form? I get it. That's the best available copy of the album, even being a pic disc. I may grab an early press of this too, for the collectible nature of it (to me, not for ""value"" or whatever).

audiophile,femrgrn,t1_fem9khl,1579267487.0,"Honestly, ""On the fly VTA"" is a bit optimistic.

Edit - uh, my bad. I had a different post up on another sub and thought this was in that, lol.

I have an air purifier in the room in the opposite corner where the table is. I use a ZeroDust as well as AT stylus cleaner to keep the stylus in good shape. Completely anecdotal, and it may just be where I have the table positioned now, but I've not had near the dust and debris issues at the stylus on Sol like I have had with other setups.

I will admit - FoB is a great band, however I don't know their entire discography like I do so many others. BUT - Infinity on High is one of my absolute favorite albums, along with stuff like Ride the Lightning, Madman Across the Water, Pink Floyd - Animals, and MCR - The Black Parade. I've tried several versions on vinyl and pretty much all of them seem to have some sort of pressing defect. I don't get it. This one is the best I've had and it's really good but is still an obviously dirty pressing (consistent, random noises, yet great audio), but maybe I just have terrible luck getting a clean one. I don't know. Either way - getting one that sounds good and is clean is something I wish I could find.

Anyway, thanks for this great sub, I'm just digging in now and already know I'm WAY behind the curve on this band. Just wanted to share my admiration and appreciation for this one, if nothing else :)"
audiophile,felzpl1,t1_felz6gw,1579235177.0,"The only extent to which I've tried that is with silk string and I was not able to get the speed high enough. I'm honestly still puzzled by all that, but I know in the VPI world, you have to have an SDS to make the silk string method work. I will say, despite the slower speed, stability of speed was very good with silk but I wasn't able to ever achieve the right speed, so I abandoned ship on that idea. I tried a few different diameters as well, thinking that might play into it. No dice, same results."

audiophile,felv37m,t1_felupiw,1579231673.0,"Not an engineer but I think the lynchpin here is the pulley weight. The heavier pulley maintains speed accuracy better, but needs a push to start. The platter is pretty small, but fairly dense. That said, compared to the platter on say the VPI Classic 2 I owned? It's very light :) But it's comparable to the PolyTable, however that was powered by basically a tank tread, a sub-platter, and an $800 motor controller to dial in and maintain perfect accuracy."
audiophile,felu52w,t1_feltuxo,1579230997.0,"Great question. So there's an alternate belt and pulley that does ""full auto start"" but that requires a lighter pulley and that makes for less consistent speed. I've actually been using that setup most of the time I've owned it. Just today I switched back once Schiit made it official that the heavier pulley and old belt are better in these regards - since their test equipment is much better than my silly phone app. And I can confirm it DOES sound more speed stable and, the more difficult thing to quantify - I feel like there is just more platter inertia, for lack of a better way to describe it? I notice it when using a MF cloth to brush off the record surface. On the lighter pulley and belt, the platter was very easy to stop - the lightest pressure only would work. With the heavier pulley and older belt, even moderate pressure (not getting too crazy here, I do value my vinyl) will not stop the platter. To me, that says better torque is being applied and thus, stylus drag is likely not as much of an issue. All that adds up, to me, to better speed and pitch stability."
audiophile,felszh9,t3_epuasp,1579230180.0,"I've held off on going too in-depth on this product as, at least for a bit, it seemed as though Schiit was giving serious consideration to not releasing it. With updates from Jason S today, as well as updates to the ordering/product page and FAQ, it looks like this will be re-released sometime in February, with corrections brought out from the beta group I'm participating in, Conrad Hoffman, and early adopters who bought right at launch.

So, not sure if this is really an AMA or whatever, but if there any questions, fire away.

Sonically, Sol is excellent for the money. Hell, it's excellent period. I've had the privilege to enjoy various tables in my room, from a ClearAudio Concept to a VPI Classic 2, and to my personal favorite, a George Merrill PolyTable 12"" edition. The PolyTable is still the best table I've owned, but at roughly 1/4th the price (with cartridge, I believe) the Sol gets shockingly close to the quiet, insightful, authoritative presentation that made me so happy with the PolyTable. Frankly, since getting Sol? I haven't missed the Poly. Not one bit.

Sol offers a ton of flexibility, but it is not a finicky platform. I set everything ""close enough"" and dialed it in by ear, and have not had to touch anything since. It just sings, with the Naga MP-200 cart I have attached to it. It scales well - showing off clear differences in phono stages, phono cables, and even some downstream stuff I've done, Sol has happily scaled up with those changes.

Downsides - the best way to achieve low wow/flutter and speed accuracy is with a ""manual start"" option for the pulley and belt. That is, you energize the motor and then give the platter a slight nudge. Don't have to touch it afterward, but you are rewarded for your little bit of manual input.

I added the IsoPuck isolation in the picture above, since the rack I have it on is not the most dense and stable thing. But since adding those, I've not had any issues whatsoever with environmental feedback or anything. I didn't really have any issues before them, but I'm of the belief that one cannot do too much isolation to a turntable and especially the motor.

Lastly - the arm is amazing. It tracks *really* well even with an elliptical hanging off it. They're cheap, relative to other arms out there, so running a couple of carts is very easy.

That's all I can think of off the top of my head, but hope others chime in with questions or thoughts. Thanks all."

I would also say that Supertramp - Crisis, Crime, and Quietest - are good foils to the Nightfly as well.

interstellar,feizgok,t1_feiz4nr,1579151623.0,"I don't agree that the movie is pretending he's being objective - in the very next scene, Brand quips ""I trust you'll be as objective then"" which I've always viewed as being very sarcastic. She's a scientist but she understands she wasn't being objective and neither was he. She just gets a pretty sick jab in, while pointing that out very sarcastically. Coop manipulates the situation to get his way. This is why he feels remorseful about it later, I think.

And we also have to remember - Coop is always looking for some way to get back home to his kids. I think he feels that getting to Mann's planet is the most efficient way to do so, just like how he concocts the plan the visit Miller's planet in the most efficient way possible, in terms of time slippage. Coop wants to go home, the entire time. Every decision he makes is in service to that goal."
interstellar,feixz8l,t3_ep53pc,1579150338.0,"I think Coop is influenced by his conversation with Donald, earlier in the movie - ""Don't trust the right thing, done for the wrong reason."" In this sense, Brand is right, but she's got an obvious bias which is why Coop tells the remaining crew that they ought to know why Brand is likely choosing this path - love. And Coop tries to reconcile this whole thing when he apologizes to Brand, the first thing he says to her when she rescues him on Mann's planet is he says he was sorry, that Mann was lying. So I think Coop is leaning too hard into the notion that she may be right but for the wrong reasons, picking Edmund's planet. He overthought it, and Romley paid the price. It's almost as if it balances out Brand's decision to keep trying to recover the data on Miller's planet, resulting in the other crew member dying (don't remember his name off the top of my head)."

vinyl,ffb6uvn,t1_ffb5o6q,1579753379.0,"So when it arrived, it didn't work. It turned on, but wouldn't output any sound beyond some weird fizzles and pops. To be clear, I bought it on eBay in ""working, tested fine"" condition. I paid $350 for it (more on that in a sec). I called out to SMC audio and the lads out there helped me to pinpoint the issue. I'm not an electronics tech but essentially there was a rather critical transistor which was no longer connected to the chassis. This is important because this particular phono pre is essentially an ""oven."" And the transistor that wasn't making contact with the heatsink is the burner for that oven, among other things. So I jerry-rigged it, and got sound out of it. Then with SMC's help I fixed it formally. SMC doesn't work on them anymore but offered all the docs and schematics for a local repair place if I needed.

Anyway - that's a lot to say that for the $350 I spent and the bit of aggravation I went through? It's a wonderful phono preamp. Of any component in my setup, I've tried the most phono stages. I just like hearing how they are all so different. Best I've had was a Herron VTPH-2. The Mod Squad one is so eerily similar - transparent, tons of drive and slam, very musical aka foot tapping, and quiet. Like the Herron, it just seems to get out of the way. I honestly couldn't ask for more performance for what I spent.

I'm also using an RLD-1 line stage and have a DNA-125 out at SMC Audio right now, getting close to being up to bat for a few upgrades. I've talked to Steve once so far and he is as described - absolutely approachable and a joy to work with. His compatriots out there at SMC are, so far as I've talked to, a blast to talk gear or music with. Very cool folks, ambassadors of hifi, in my opinion."

In metal, especially - I focus on the instrumentation. Vocals are merely an instrument. Very, very few of my favorites are so due to vocals and lyrics. 

So I think it was pretty natural for me to get into Jazz a little more as I grew up, but having made some changes to my stereo and having tried some things lately with gear - the ""realism"" of jazz has really become sort of startling to me. I am fortunate to have good pressings of several classics, with a few more on the way. I'll share what I'm listening to but at this point, I really don't speak the language of jazz.

I heard a system in a strip mall in Omaha where, without doubt, it felt like you could walk up between the speakers and measure the distance between the tom and the cymbal on the drum kit. It was incredible. It was also incredibly expensive, but definitely eye-opening. Speakers were Rockport, and they were boxes, not planars.

audiophile,fenlzwb,t1_fenlmh1,1579287546.0,"I see where you're going. From an industrial design perspective, Schiit is minimalist. Not flashy. I can find or take some other pics of it if you want to see some other angles, certainly. I think putting it up on the ""pucks"" that I'm using, helps it sort of stand out.

Now, what I can tell you - EVERYONE asks about it. I post in quite a few FB groups and in vinyl/heavyvinyl here and I can't remember a single post of mine where someone didn't ask about it. Most times wanting just to know more about it, but it does catch the eye. I had a little of that with the PolyTable as well since it also looks very unique, but it is also very muted, very utilitarian in design. So I think Sol is more eye catching, however I don't think anyone would walk up on it and suspect it's a $5k+ table. Even the arm - it's absolutely amazing, but it's simple. Being carbon fiber helps from the aesthetic side, but it also makes for a very capable musical instrument, which a tonearm really is. So I think Sol rides a pretty unique line here. It's presence belies its price, but it's not so over the top that it seems extravagant."
audiophile,fenl6pb,t1_fenl0kc,1579287050.0,"My apologies - the PolyTable is still the superior table. It's not a debate, but for what I paid for Sol, and what I'd have to invest to get the Super 12 back? That's what I don't miss :) Don't get me wrong - my endgame table is still his topend table. I forget what it's called, but if I can afford it ten years from now and one happens to pop up on the used market? It'll be mine. Sol is good, but it's not THAT good. George also happens to be one of the nicest people I've interacted with in Audio. A true gem, no pun intended.

&#x200B;

And indeed, it is high praise for Sol but I also intended that to be a compliment to the PolyTable, but re-reading it, I could have been way more clear on that point. It's my reference, full stop."
audiophile,fen2iah,t3_epuasp,1579275519.0,"Wanted to note something important - Schiit has addressed a concern that I raised in a comment on here (not because of the comment, but just in general) for people new to vinyl who are buying a first or second turntable and who are neither comfortable with, or knowledgeable about some of the setup options Sol offers. If purchased with a cartridge, Schiit will setup the table and cart at the factory, prior to shipping. That will be a much more ""plug and play"" experience for those use cases."
audiophile,fen2672,t1_fen1rlj,1579275305.0,"I think the most frustrating initial flaw was the original headshell - it just didn't give enough travel and space for some carts, to align them without bending or compromising the connection pins. They fixed that fairly quickly.

But the speed thing - I think Schiit really wanted to nail the speed, W/F, AND auto start. And ultimately to do all of those, was going to add expense and re-engineering to just about everything - platter, bearing, and motor. So I think it came down to - is auto-start a must have? At this price point, for what you're getting in performance? I think they made the right call that it is in fact not a dealbreaker. And to be clear - this isn't a turntable for newbies, for beginners who are just learning about vinyl. Despite it's simplicity, it is very flexible and thus, could be intimidating with its learning curve for inexperienced setup folks.

So I think that was the crux - could they satisfy the speed and W/F requirements, without added cost and re-work and the answer was yes, but users have to nudge the platter to get it going, and from there it's fine.

I put about 4 records through it last night and by the 3rd one, the ""nudge"" was muscle memory. No big deal, and I cannot overstate how happy I am with the sound.

&#x200B;

Edit - and I'll break this out into a separate comment. But on my thoughts about a table for beginners - Schiit has apparently addressed that by ""pre-setting"" the table at the factory when it is bought with a cartridge. That will make it MUCH more friendly to those new, or just getting into vinyl or upgrading from a much simpler setup for the first time."

FallOutBoy,femro14,t1_femrej4,1579267655.0,"I think I'll pick up that HT version and see how it goes.

And also being a fan of Tool - Lateralus, which is only on vinyl in Pic Disc form? I get it. That's the best available copy of the album, even being a pic disc. I may grab an early press of this too, for the collectible nature of it (to me, not for ""value"" or whatever).

audiophile,femrgrn,t1_fem9khl,1579267487.0,"Honestly, ""On the fly VTA"" is a bit optimistic.

I have an air purifier in the room in the opposite corner where the table is. I use a ZeroDust as well as AT stylus cleaner to keep the stylus in good shape. Completely anecdotal, and it may just be where I have the table positioned now, but I've not had near the dust and debris issues at the stylus on Sol like I have had with other setups.

BUT - Infinity on High is one of my absolute favorite albums, along with stuff like Ride the Lightning, Madman Across the Water, Pink Floyd - Animals, and MCR - The Black Parade. I've tried several versions on vinyl and pretty much all of them seem to have some sort of pressing defect. I don't get it. This one is the best I've had and it's really good but is still an obviously dirty pressing (consistent, random noises, yet great audio), but maybe I just have terrible luck getting a clean one. I don't know. Either way - getting one that sounds good and is clean is something I wish I could find.

I'm honestly still puzzled by all that, but I know in the VPI world, you have to have an SDS to make the silk string method work. I will say, despite the slower speed, stability of speed was very good with silk but I wasn't able to ever achieve the right speed, so I abandoned ship on that idea. I tried a few different diameters as well, thinking that might play into it. No dice, same results."

audiophile,felv37m,t1_felupiw,1579231673.0,"Not an engineer but I think the lynchpin here is the pulley weight. The heavier pulley maintains speed accuracy better, but needs a push to start. The platter is pretty small, but fairly dense. That said, compared to the platter on say the VPI Classic 2 I owned? It's very light :) But it's comparable to the PolyTable, however that was powered by basically a tank tread, a sub-platter, and an $800 motor controller to dial in and maintain perfect accuracy."
audiophile,felu52w,t1_feltuxo,1579230997.0,"Great question. So there's an alternate belt and pulley that does ""full auto start"" but that requires a lighter pulley and that makes for less consistent speed. I've actually been using that setup most of the time I've owned it. Just today I switched back once Schiit made it official that the heavier pulley and old belt are better in these regards - since their test equipment is much better than my silly phone app. And I can confirm it DOES sound more speed stable and, the more difficult thing to quantify - I feel like there is just more platter inertia, for lack of a better way to describe it? I notice it when using a MF cloth to brush off the record surface. On the lighter pulley and belt, the platter was very easy to stop - the lightest pressure only would work. With the heavier pulley and older belt, even moderate pressure (not getting too crazy here, I do value my vinyl) will not stop the platter. To me, that says better torque is being applied and thus, stylus drag is likely not as much of an issue. All that adds up, to me, to better speed and pitch stability."
audiophile,felszh9,t3_epuasp,1579230180.0,"I've held off on going too in-depth on this product as, at least for a bit, it seemed as though Schiit was giving serious consideration to not releasing it. With updates from Jason S today, as well as updates to the ordering/product page and FAQ, it looks like this will be re-released sometime in February, with corrections brought out from the beta group I'm participating in, Conrad Hoffman, and early adopters who bought right at launch.

So, not sure if this is really an AMA or whatever, but if there any questions, fire away.

Sonically, Sol is excellent for the money. Hell, it's excellent period. I've had the privilege to enjoy various tables in my room, from a ClearAudio Concept to a VPI Classic 2, and to my personal favorite, a George Merrill PolyTable 12"" edition. The PolyTable is still the best table I've owned, but at roughly 1/4th the price (with cartridge, I believe) the Sol gets shockingly close to the quiet, insightful, authoritative presentation that made me so happy with the PolyTable. Frankly, since getting Sol? I haven't missed the Poly. Not one bit.

Sol offers a ton of flexibility, but it is not a finicky platform. I set everything ""close enough"" and dialed it in by ear, and have not had to touch anything since. It just sings, with the Naga MP-200 cart I have attached to it. It scales well - showing off clear differences in phono stages, phono cables, and even some downstream stuff I've done, Sol has happily scaled up with those changes.

Downsides - the best way to achieve low wow/flutter and speed accuracy is with a ""manual start"" option for the pulley and belt. That is, you energize the motor and then give the platter a slight nudge. Don't have to touch it afterward, but you are rewarded for your little bit of manual input.

I added the IsoPuck isolation in the picture above, since the rack I have it on is not the most dense and stable thing. But since adding those, I've not had any issues whatsoever with environmental feedback or anything. I didn't really have any issues before them, but I'm of the belief that one cannot do too much isolation to a turntable and especially the motor.

Lastly - the arm is amazing. It tracks *really* well even with an elliptical hanging off it. They're cheap, relative to other arms out there, so running a couple of carts is very easy.

That's all I can think of off the top of my head, but hope others chime in with questions or thoughts. Thanks all."

I would also say that Supertramp - Crisis, Crime, and Quietest - are good foils to the Nightfly as well.

This sets up Coop's understanding later that love can cross dimensions, just like gravity, and it's what saves the human race. I was reading something last night and it essentially espoused that characters in Nolan movies are shallow, and basically just gears in a giant plot machine. Brand and Coop, to me, completely disprove that theory. But what do I know. I just love the movie :)"
vinyl,fej0bzy,t1_fej05s9,1579152404.0,"I honestly haven't or if I have, I wouldn't be able to make a valid comparison. I can just say that the price on this is really hard to justify. Yes, it sounds phenomenal but I just don't see this recording ever being put out poorly. It's a landmark, and I think any copy on vinyl will do it justice, same for any Redbook or higher which was cut from an early gen source. I can't say what those would have been, but that's my take, for whatever it's worth :)"

Later link is a repress of the first and, sadly, no less outlandishly expensive :("

Not sure if that's what you are looking for - let me know if not!"
interstellar,feizgok,t1_feiz4nr,1579151623.0,"I don't agree that the movie is pretending he's being objective - in the very next scene, Brand quips ""I trust you'll be as objective then"" which I've always viewed as being very sarcastic. She's a scientist but she understands she wasn't being objective and neither was he. She just gets a pretty sick jab in, while pointing that out very sarcastically. Coop manipulates the situation to get his way. This is why he feels remorseful about it later, I think.

And we also have to remember - Coop is always looking for some way to get back home to his kids. I think he feels that getting to Mann's planet is the most efficient way to do so, just like how he concocts the plan the visit Miller's planet in the most efficient way possible, in terms of time slippage. Coop wants to go home, the entire time. Every decision he makes is in service to that goal."
interstellar,feixz8l,t3_ep53pc,1579150338.0,"I think Coop is influenced by his conversation with Donald, earlier in the movie - ""Don't trust the right thing, done for the wrong reason."" In this sense, Brand is right, but she's got an obvious bias which is why Coop tells the remaining crew that they ought to know why Brand is likely choosing this path - love. And Coop tries to reconcile this whole thing when he apologizes to Brand, the first thing he says to her when she rescues him on Mann's planet is he says he was sorry, that Mann was lying. So I think Coop is leaning too hard into the notion that she may be right but for the wrong reasons, picking Edmund's planet. He overthought it, and Romley paid the price. It's almost as if it balances out Brand's decision to keep trying to recover the data on Miller's planet, resulting in the other crew member dying (don't remember his name off the top of my head)."
