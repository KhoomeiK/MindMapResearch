SuicideWatch,fdg31hq,t3_ekphvu,1578378153.0,"Are you still here? Please don't go, it will get better I swear, I have had trouble myself, but I will not pretend to personally know you. You just have to ride it out, it is much easier said than done, I know. You probably think you will be a burden to anyone you reach out to, I feel the same way, but trust me, you won't, if you don't want to see a psychiatrist, just talk to a friend or family member, they will be glad you did. I you need to talk DM me, but if you don't want to talk about personal stuff with a complete stranger, don't I wouldn't either. Hang in there I wish you the best of luck.
P.S. watch [this](https://youtu.be/vmIUvp0e1bw) to the end, it helped me"

I have a lot less life experience than you, but please just give my words a bit of thought. You are not a human piece of garbage, the simple fact that you are saying this and acknowledging the fact that you have flaws proves you are not a horrible person. A truly horrible person would not acknowledge their own shortcomings. Second off, grades aren't everything. I have an uncle who's neighbor is a garbage man, he has a wife and kids and loves his life. Einstein, Tesla, and Walt Disney did horrible in school and dropped out of collage! Thirdly, and most importantly, human life is a beautiful, wondrous thing that knows no equal, it seems horrible for days, months, even years, but you've got so much left to go to give up now, and you will face better days, trust me. If you're family really hates you that much, they are not your family, your family are the people you love as friends and not blood related family. Remember that living what you think will make you happy doesn't make you happy, what makes you happy, makes you happy I do not know the extent of your pain, but I know it will get  better, hang in there, I wish you the very best of luck.
Sorry it took so long"
