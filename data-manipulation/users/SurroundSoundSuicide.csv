depression,fezyfmk,t3_eqvfig,1579463254.0,"So don't look forward to anything yet, not in this state of mind. Being depressed is like being stuck in a dark hole, being really depressed is being in a dark hole and the flashlight runs out of batteries. There's no more light on how to get out. you think anything you could do to get out will suck, it won't help, it won't be worth it. Why bother, it's all dark.

You have to start crawling out in pitch black.

Pick ONE thing to pursue, something as small as 5 minutes of physical exercise a day and follow it religiously for 1 week, at the same time everyday, ignore yourself saying it's pointless. When the week is over and you accomplished it you'll think wow I did that. The light starts to come on a little bit, you're still in the hole but you can see something dim, do it every day for another week. the light gets just a little bit brighter, you'll start thinking wow I might be depressed but I'm doing this one thing at least, the light starts to come on just a little bit more.

 that's how pulling yourself out of the darkest hole starts, once your flashlight is on you can start seeing a way out. some sort of path. Maybe one you didn't expect but it's a way back to the surface."

""Watch this little birb take a shower""

Unless you want to play dumb, it's obvious the intent is not to baby talk seeing as how every single word in this sentence is perfectly normal except for bird which is spelled birb because internet custom, not baby talk. So yes, in a way word count does matter.

If you stop and think for one moment, there really is no difference between your choice to use cheeze in your username and their choice to use birb in their title.
