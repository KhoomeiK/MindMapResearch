From what I've seen there are steps in the  process that would be made better(safer) if you knew what to expect(see, smell) and what should be your warning signs. Those seem to be missing from your procedure. Also, if you do choose to go ahead please ensure you have adequate ventilation.

Possibly take a look at:  [https://www.prepchem.com/synthesis-of-amyl-nitrite/](https://www.prepchem.com/synthesis-of-amyl-nitrite/)"
