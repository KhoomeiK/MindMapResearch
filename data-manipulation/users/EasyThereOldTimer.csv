Russia and China will most certainly use this tech imminently and other 'bad guys' will be right behind.  

The idea of not supporting scary tech (see facial recognition) is a noble one, but it's not one that folks like the Taliban will ever forego because the UN decides it's cheating.

I support a view in which the world collectively wants fewer dead bodies around, but I don't believe it to be a reality as far as the tech exists.  Bad guys will always take the easiest way out of a fair fight on the street as much as on the battlefield.  We need to harness the tech if only to defend against it."

ABoringDystopia,fexh72a,t1_fewfsoi,1579430951.0,"Okay.  This will probably get absolutely buried, but a service workers union would never work in the restaurant industry.  I say this a lot and nobody (outside of the hospitality industry) seems to understand.  Employing union employees is a *massive* expense for a small business owner. A restaurant owners labor overhead would nearly double, because not only do the employees pay into the union, but the owner does too, in the form of increased benefits and wage payments (to account for union dues paid for by the employee) You can’t rob from Peter to pay Paul in the industry unless you’re the Olive Garden or Marriott.

I am a blue collar dude with all accordant values, but to force a teeny-tiny business, like most higher end restaurants (generally any restaurant group under 10 outlets) to defacto hire only union people, you demolish that barrier between passion and profit.  Nobody who truly cares about food will be able to risk that sort of financial burden for any artistic or creative endeavor once a union is involved; the costs are simply too unfavorable.

Once restaurant workers are forced to be in a union, the only people who hire will be larger chains and hotels - the only “free market” solution to a problem that favors the wealthy up top instead of the skilled underneath.  

I’ve worked in fine dining restaurants for my entire professional career in one form or another, and I’ll tell you (with 20 years of experience in every facet of the industry) that no independent restaurant can tackle the expenses with union employees to consider.  

It’s an uphill battle on Reddit, though.  People want to abolish the concept of a tip-based payment structure without raising menu prices to make up for the difference.  The last place I’d ever look for a rational discussion of actual restaurant finances based in reality is this site.

The true free-market solution is to allow businesses to continue to function under either a tip-based or service-charge based system and leave menu prices as they are; OR to increase menu prices by that difference and continue to operate as is.  There’s no third solution if we want small, truly independent businesses to have their shot at the public."
