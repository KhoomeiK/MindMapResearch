comicbooks,ffpr43x,t1_ffplhep,1580102742.0,"I was literally just about to post that haha Block Mania, followed by Apocalypse war is a great place to start and all covered in Case File 5. I would also throw in The Dark Judges storyline, which you can get as a trade and The Cursed Earth Saga if you fancy a romp across the irradiated waste lands of America, full of muties and other nasties haha. The America storyline is superb too, one where Dredd is very much the villain."

comicbooks,ffno6d7,t1_ffneeeb,1580068437.0,"Yeah the Judge Dredd fanbase is predominately British haha. I would recommend Judge Dredd, he’s a great anti-hero set in dystopian post-apocalyptic American police state where he enforces the law with a gun, crushes democracy and occasionally has fisticuffs with Batman. If you ever want to get a flavour of British comics then dig in to the 2000ad back catalogue, some brilliant stories and art to be found.   
   
If you want a quick taste of what Dredd is about check out the 2012 film *Dredd* with Karl Urban."
