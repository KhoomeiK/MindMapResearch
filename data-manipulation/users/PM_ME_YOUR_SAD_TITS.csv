The improvement by all of them each comeback is amazing, but I am most impressed by the dramatic difference between P48 Yiren vs. Yiren now. Her expressions rule.

Interesting theory from the r/kpop post regarding Mia getting so many lines for these comebacks and Yena's potential future reveal as part of the group:

>I have a theory that Mia is getting all the lines that are supposed to go for Yena, so it will be easier to redistribute the lines in all the Everglow songs when she joins the group. The line distribution won't be a problem like it is today if I'm right. If Yena takes 30/35% of Mia's lines it will be pretty fair overall."

Seems like in that case she's the asshole who wasted the time of and emotionally fucked with an innocent stranger who was sent there based on a clerical error they had no part in. Have the balls to do the home visit? The fuck? The person sent to visit had no idea what they were walking into.
