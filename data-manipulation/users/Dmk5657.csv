funny,ffao09i,t1_ff9i1kj,1579740441.0,"I dont hold but will if the person has told me they left. Seems reasonable and nobody has ever flaked out. 

Plus it adds urgency to other buyers, you can tell them its pending pickup."
funny,ffanpbk,t1_ffaimbw,1579740235.0,"Exactly it adds a step for no reason. Just send what you are planning on sending after i responded yes.

This would also filter out the people who ask if its still available and then never say anything again."
cars,ff6km2y,t1_felptsp,1579629211.0,"That sounds awful but when i checked last year the discounts on 5 series were 8-10k, and then there's the federal tax rebate. So thankfully the owners are not getting hosed as much as it would seem."
todayilearned,feyojcg,t1_feyk1ba,1579448327.0,"I like the implication that the dvds by mail were not physical lol.

It was awesome though and superior to netflix."
todayilearned,feymq1a,t1_feydf5k,1579447668.0,"The blockbuster online service was great. You immediately got a free movie for turning into the store. I don't  recall there being a delay and i was able to watch so many more movies than with netflix. This was in 2007, though Im sure it eventually became worse and i forgot why i cancelled ."
todayilearned,feg1iw5,t1_feexame,1579072928.0,"I agree it is weird, if you had two planes one with all seats reclined and one with them fixed, which is more comfortable on average for the group?

Obviously the reclined plane. The room you lose when the person in front of you reclines is gained when you recline yourself- almost everyone is more comfortable."
Costco,fefr05c,t1_feemwe6,1579062694.0,"I didnt realize this until recently,  but synthetic oil is just barely more expensive than normal oil. Though mechanics charge soooooo much more for synthetic.  If you want synthetic I definitely think you will save."
funny,fefqhr8,t1_feelx3j,1579062309.0,Genrally speaking it comes down to population density. The less the population in the area the chiller the driving.  This probably applies outside the u.s. as well; I hink its human nature.
nova,fefpwej,t1_fef1qid,1579061862.0,Yeah... the largest cruise ships in the world are around a billion... how on earth is a rail bridge for a narrow river double that.
askcarsales,fecybcx,t3_eoibq7,1578989642.0,I don't get it.  Isnt he obligated to provide a new check? Is it just not worth the headache or publicity to sue him ?
gifs,fdxansk,t1_fdwsn2n,1578766911.0,"As a loving parrot owner , ""Prick bird""  is redundant lol"
dataisbeautiful,fd2ymmd,t1_fd2p5an,1578153003.0,"Wouldn't a left turn green arrow at the original intersection be the same thing ? 

I think I might get it though , the system is just pushing activities away from the intersection to another new mini intersection. Same total sum, but maybe safer because less is occuring in a single location."
dataisbeautiful,fd2o4lf,t1_fd2jes4,1578149984.0,I still dont get it. Most cars or trucks are going to U turn into the far right lane. Isn't that the same number of lanes you would left turn past ? (Unless the intersection has an extra right turn only lane)
cars,fcwohg5,t1_fcwjozl,1578031637.0,I thought bald tires perform better than new in dry weather. ( although are incredibly dangerous in wet)
cars,fcfcwul,t1_fcez63p,1577628748.0,since corvettes are probably owned on average by older people who dont drive them them much I'd imagine the insurance is reasonable.
Costco,fbvdv8z,t1_fbsvs0k,1577129394.0,"I think it was because of the holiday weekend. But this past Saturday it was a 5 minute line almost to the foot court to get your receipt checked. 

15 minutes bumper to bumper to leave the parking lot- it was like leaving after a football game ."
