bipolar,fh8cwu5,t3_f1m64t,1581357069.0,"I had a name for my fella. I haven’t seen it since my last episode but I called it the Shadow Man (creative right? Lol). It would be this small (at first) shadow of a human that would only show itself inside of lightbulbs and as the light “got closer” so did it, and bigger, until it was the full size of a human and in my room, I remember on multiple occasions just sitting in the dark or running out of the room if a neighbours light came on. The dark also sucked because that just meant the Shadow Man could hide better. Scared the bejesus out of me during psychosis."

make sure you take them as prescribed because lithium levels can revert back to what they were in a matter of days!

I'm VERY lucky to be one of the people in the world that found a mix of meds that works well for my bipolar and I hope your in the same boat, because life is hella okay sometimes!"

analog,ffpgwv0,t3_euc30f,1580094761.0,This is cool. It really feels like a moment I've  felt exactly before. Kinda wading through the noise feeling.
bipolar,ffp6g1s,t3_euercn,1580087424.0,Nice! Looks good! My dream one day is to have my own little garden. <3
Embroidery,ffp16v8,t3_eub8af,1580084198.0,Holy guac! I'm trying to make my own deepsea creatures for embroidery using glow-in-the-dark thread and this is making me so excited! This is a freaking cool project and inspiring a lot!
analog,ffifhbg,t3_etm0g1,1579972617.0,"As soon as I saw this it immediately reminded me of the same discomfort from seeing [this strange image years ago of children pretending to be ghosts in a play.](https://collections.eastman.org/objects/125554/childrens-play?ctx=86520cb0-f086-4ce6-ae65-09bb4ae627dc&idx=7). There’s a sense of very enclosed space, and that these costumes almost seem natural? I’m not sure how to put it, but your image comes across as supernatural or science fiction.

Really cool OP!"
piercing,feahl8m,t3_eo52yk,1578948878.0,"Holy guac! I have this on my left ear and had to go to 4 different piercers before someone would do it for me. I took the ring out years ago but I want to do it again! 

Yay finally I’ve seen someone else with this!"
bipolar,fd41q0a,t3_ejywqs,1578163531.0,"Happy birthday OP! I'm sorry you're spending it in the way/state that is not best for you, but I hope that the day can still feel a little special! Its *your* birthday so take some time for yourself and do what you enjoy!"
