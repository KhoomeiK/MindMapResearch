Ultimately... why would you want to be with a woman who would resent you for something you can’t change like your height? I have many friends who are married to men shorter than them. I have been out with men shorter than me. The women exist. 

I’d say on dating sites and such you’re getting a very very biased polling pool of women who are set in their ways and have their preferences upturned for their own benefit... so it’s difficult to see past them. 

I’m sorry you’re hurting so much over this, but I would argue that you’re wrong in assuming most women have their preference in taller men. Please don’t let this turn you into an incel."
unpopularopinion,ffhlx1h,t1_ffhluu5,1579941521.0,"I’ve asked people out and been rejected multiple times and still chose to keep on keeping on. I don’t blame all of male-kind for their actions, I just know it’s okay to have preferences and I may not fall into those lines for some people and that is okay."
unpopularopinion,ffhlgpo,t3_etnii8,1579940867.0,"I like confidence. And there is nothing confident about lying about your height or not owning it. 

There also isn’t anything confident in blaming people for having preferences for what seems to be a lack in personality."
wow,ffegy0g,t3_et6bdw,1579847585.0,"Getting my mom into WoW is one of the best things I’ve ever done to date. So many years of bonding through the game, taking school off and going to midnight releases, and going to Blizzcon. 

I’ve since moved on, but she is still active today (since vanilla!)."
TrueOffMyChest,ffefnct,t3_et5f4s,1579846185.0,"I 100% agree with you. I got into a heated discussion with my sister regarding her “gender fluidity” and its ties to her sexuality. It ended with me explaining to her that putting gender norms on activities is 1000000000% against LGBTQ+ thinking and so being gender fluid is against it as well. 

It also advanced into me getting annoyed at her generation for the constant need to place labels on themselves to feel “special” and “included”. Ugh."
