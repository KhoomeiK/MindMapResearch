JusticeServed,fet846w,t1_fesi8m7,1579372628.0,"It is true, some churches are beginning now to do background checks.  They recognize that they cannot trust god to protect them.   They recognize that their leaders are also not to be trusted.  Their institutions are not to be trusted.  And as a result many are leaving their churches exactly because they realize that there is nothing special about them and it does not offer anything that they cannot get somewhere else.  That is reality.

That said, you are avoiding is the fact that religion is based on faith and belief.  So the people who stay with the church are trying to believe and have faith.  In fact the most fanatical are the ones who cling to it and glorify blind faith.  They see blindly trust in god as a good thing and will ignore/deny anything that contradicts this.  This mindset trains people to not think critically and not question authority.  

Does your church teach you to question your Priest or Pope?  Do you challenge their authority?  or do you accept their authority and have faith in god?  Does it teach you the dangers of blind faith in god or religious leaders?

Exactly my point.  That makes for people who glorify blind faith and trust ""god"" blindly.  That often makes them also trust those who they consider ""gods' representatives, the church leaders (as you said, this is why they feel so betrayed, they trusted and were betrayed).   Churches are also very unlikely to screen childcare givers or believe reports of abuse as that would mean admitting their trust and faith was misplaced and that ""god"" does not keep their church or people safe.
