The problem with your formatting is that you ""indented"" your paragraphs by starting them with a few spaces. Just don't do that.

Here's Jspooper93's post with formatting corrected:

All too often we have to endure the ignorant little whelps who haven't even finished high school about how we are all disgusting monsters because some of us either don't believe in climate change, or because we are still driving around to go places. 

I hate hypocrisy. And I get it, all of us are guilty of it at some point. But what these kids don't realize is that with the state of the world we live in right now, there is literally nothing we can do to alleviate it. Any other mode of transportation we have is either impractical or illegal. Try using a God damn horse and carriage on a fucking interstate and see how long it takes before you get crushed by a semi. Of course even the most vocal aren't ever going to entertain that thought. Which is why I downright dismiss their arguments. They aren't willing to put their money where their mouth is. 

Contrast that with the vegans/vegetarians. Are they annoying? Certainly. They for the most part lambast everyone else who doesn't fall in line with their dietary expectations. But do you know something? They actually follow what they believe. They try to lead by example. Instead of making excuses. What I'm trying to say here is that if you are a believer in climate change, and you hate society because of it, then you better not be driving a fucking car. If you are one of those people who despises corporations, then you better not be using a fucking iPhone."

Don't text speak in written correspondence ever. No u for you, no r for are, no ppl for people. Capitalize at the start of each sentence and put a period at the end of each as well.

You did two dots at the end of some of your sentences and you meant to do ellipses. Those are three dots, not two.

When you get to the end of a complete thought, create a new paragraph to show that you're on to the next thing. (People who can't paragraph are a sign of being crazy when reading English.)
