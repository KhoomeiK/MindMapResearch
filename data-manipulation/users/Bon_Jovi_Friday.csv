raspberry_pi,fgrb7pw,t3_eyftxn,1581042587.0,"I've been looking into security cameras for a while now and none of the options I've seen have really fit what I've been looking for. I came across a guide on how to make a custom security camera system using raspberry pis for cheap and have been doing some research for the past week or so. I have never worked with raspberry pi or have done any type of work like this whatsoever so hopefully I'm not getting too ambitious for a first project.

&#x200B;

What I would like to accomplish is:

Three Raspberry Pi Zero Ws with Pi cameras connected wirelessly to a Pi 3 hub with a hdd for local storage and a display for live images from the cameras, each running MotionEyeOS, while keeping the cost as low as possible. The pi+cameras will be fitted inside dummy cctv camera shells and mounted outdoors. I'll be using IR-cut cameras with external IR lighting for night time surveillance.

&#x200B;

The cameras themselves seem like the easy part. The idea for the hub is actually based on two separate projects that I saw that I would like to try to combine. The first was for a [hub with storage](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/cctv-raspberry-pi-based-system-storage-motioneyeos), the other was a [hub with a live feed](https://youtu.be/0tvX_gsv2ZU). I thought it might be possible to combine the two ideas into one but I have no idea if that would actually work.

&#x200B;

I've started putting together a parts list which I'll post [here](https://pastebin.com/5fm630EM).  I still need a couple things like a hdd, power supplies for the cameras, and I'm sure some other stuff that I won't even realize I need until I actually need it.

&#x200B;

That's the basic idea of it. Is this doable? Are there any glaring issues or things that I'm missing?"

The guy in unit 1 is a total piece of shit alcoholic who beats his wife and has the cops at his door regularly. The guy in unit 2 hadn't been there very long but never bothered me. Apparently as the story goes, they were both drunk and unit 2 tried to start a fight with unit 1. Started getting in unit 1s face and from what I understand threw the first punch. Unit 1 hit the guy once, knocked him out and his head hit the pavement, in my driveway. He went into a coma that night and they pulled the plug a week later. 



Now I was home during all of this but completely missed it because I was watching a movie. I had no idea anything even happened until the next morning 3 detectives knocked on my door and asked to see my security camera footage. I pulled up whatever the motion capture footage caught which didn't turn out to be anything.
