AmItheAsshole,ffeiz8k,t1_ffe9kfo,1579849942.0,"What business have you actually worked in?  I actually work in a large private business and occasionally get asked to assist with finding technical accommodations for employees, and even contractors, that work with us.  Any manager worth their salt, and business looking to move forward in a global economy where countries have a wide swath of requirements for disability accommodarions, will jump at the opportunity to find reasonable accommodation for folks that need it.  I've typically found these people to be incredibly grateful, and the lessons learned finding creative solutions can have ripple effects across toolsets and structures we use with clients and typically abled personnel.

That's all well before I even get into the ABSOLUTE HELL that can rain down on everyone involved if you don't abide by the law requiring accommodation in these areas.  The US takes it seriously as a whole, some states far more than others, but good luck with this attitude when you're dealing with employees in countries with stronger employee protections like the UK.

In short, you're talking out your ass.  Good luck passing this argument off in defense of an ADA complaint."

I've never really gotten the Wesley Crusher hate, but I was a young kid when TNG was running so I had a different perspective from many. 

That being said, if you just really can't fathom Wil being an awesome dude outside of Wesley, go watch some Eureka, or better yet TableTop or Titansgrave.  Eureka's solid modern day science fiction and he's a lot of fun in it.  TableTop and Titansgrave will let you see Wil the person as he really is in his native environment...playing games with friends.

Certainly I'm glad to see Jeri Ryan and Brent Sooner involved, but I want to see where Wesley ended up and get th chance to watch him interact as an adult with Picard.

He was undoubtedly a father figure to Wesley, and I'd love to see that relationship blossom in this style of show.  Say all the things so many watching have wished they got to say to their dads, and show the world in yet another way that family is so often the ones you choose."
startrek,fez2706,t3_enu6xx,1579453152.0,"I'm seriously stoked for this.  I had a different experience from a lot of folks I think, watching TNG as a kid and seeing u/wil on screen.  He was the big kid at school I wanted to be like when I saw the show.  I loved seeing him save the day and being an actual officer on a starship, I spent many hours with friends pretending to do the same!

Then, as I got older my appreciation for TNG changed, I catch a lot I never understood then, but I still look at his performance with the same heartwarming nostalgia one might get looking at old family movies or flipping through a photo album.  He's the kid from the playground that got to actually do it.  He fucking flew the Enterprise!

Then, later in life, he got me again.  Wil started TableTop and that looked like a hell of a lot of fun, so my friends and I started playing board games.  I now have a large bookshelf full and overflowing with them, many purchased at his suggestion.  My love of Geek and Sundry, derived directly from TableTop, lead me to Critical Role and as such a new weekly occasion where friends of mine and I take a few hours to live in the real world together, once again pretending to be in a fake one.

Wil's undoubtedly the best friend I've never met, and I'm just now realizing that.  Thank you for the now thousands upon thousands of hours of enjoyment you've brought to my life.  From the tree stumps on the playground we used as the bridge of the Enterprise, to the game room of present where we roll dice and sip adult beverages...you've been a constant source of inspiration."

20 years later and we've had a strong run as the country's ""it"" city for a lot of solid business, particularly tech, investment and everyone wised up to the absolute insanity that is the level of talent in each and every bar all up and down Broadway.

Lots and lots of transplants in town for fans from out of state to visit when their team comes by.  If we can see some sustained success out of the team, however, we have a shot of becoming a hell of a football town.  There's no shortage of sports fanatics around here.

We are going to need a new stadium though.  I've been a diehard fan from the jump, but there's absolutely no reason for me to go and watch a game downtown right now.  It's more comfortable, and more fun, to do it at home with friends.  Get us a roof we can close and make some noise and things will get interesting real quick.
