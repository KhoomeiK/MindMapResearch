>""Morse's second child was born in 1823 and his third child arrived two years later, but tragedy followed. One month after the birth of his third child, Lucretia Morse died suddenly at age 25 and was buried in New Haven before he could return.""

To say that editor embellished it is a vast understatement.  Then a vandal came and vandalized a quote that was the figment of someone's imagination to begin with.  Then subsequent editors, amazingly, plugged unrelated sources onto this already imaginary, then vandalized letter.

And if you google it +""samuel morse"" +""your wife is dead"" ... then guess what, the paltry results that do return just circularly quote from that older wikipedia edit."

That's no coincidence: Osuna's contract was acquired by the Astros from the Toronto Blue Jays. While with the Blue Jays, he was arrested and accused in Canada of assaulting the mother of his then-3-year-old child. Osuna did not face charges after agreeing to the equivalent of a restraining order."

>The color comes from how light is refracted 

Think you mean reflection?

&#x200B;

> Blue eyes have the least amount, leading to the color blue being reflected mostly, 

I think like this answer is a little misleading, because the follow up question is why is not red color reflected mostly?  or green color reflected mostly--what about melanin that makes it pick on blue?    

It would be easier with a diagram, but a better answer is it's due to wavelength.   If one pictures a longer wavelength (red) is more like a straight line, while a shorter wave length (blue) is very squiggly, and you want to send both lines through a field of of targets (melanin), where if the line hits a melanin target it gets reflected back and you ""win"", but if it hits the back wall (iris) and get absorbed you ""lose"".    If there are very few targets, the squiggly lines would have a much higher chance of hitting a target.  So less melanin = most squiggly wavelengths winning = showing blue,  more melanin = every wavelength hits and we all know from crayons, if you mix a bunch of colors together you tend to see black/brown.   

It's also important to note the red eyes seen in albinism or bad pictures is not from the red wavelengths getting through, but just the blood vessels in the back of the iris being seen."

Second: I hope this makes those of you who have been actively denying the evidence to be more receptive about questioning your government in the future.   Believe it or not, the west (for the most part) still deeply value truth, at least compared to the wall of propaganda the oppressive governments such as China, North Korea, and yes Iran operate under.

I know a lot of replies are raining on you for focusing on your credit score.  But speaking as someone with what I would deem a high credit score, if I do say so myself (won't say what it is, because then the downvotes rain for bragging or something), it at minimum would give you access to extremely beneficial APRs, in my case usually 3% and under (there are 0%s, but always a fine-print gotcha of 3% fee), which you can use to further consolidate your debt--so your goal to improve your credit score is not misguided.

One thing you need to be careful of:  two huge factors of credit scores are:

1. length of credit history: so by closing off all cards except one, and people who do this usually tend to have the newest (as they tend to offer the lowest introductory APRs) card left, you are actually reducing your credit score
2. credit utilization which is the heaviest weighted factor: so again, by closing all the cards with paid of 0 balances, but keeping 1 card that consolidates all the debt, ending up with very high utilization, you are reducing your score significantly

It is a common misconception that having too many cards open is harmful.  While it does reduce the score slightly, the penalties from short credit history and high utilization are generally far, far more negative.  IMHO you should keep your longest tenured card, keep a zero balance, and do so indefinitely."
