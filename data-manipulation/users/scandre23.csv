AskReddit,ffkriml,t3_etywzw,1580027610.0,"It was a very bad time in my life. It came over me quite suddenly. I had the gun. It didn't work. I wrote a poem about it.  But I've had suicidal thoughts often  but I don't believe in suicide.  But I had a feeling like it was the best option to end this grief. It was overwhelming.  I came to my senses. And went on with a miserable existence.  The thoughts still come into my mind. But that night was the strongest need I ever felt to make this happen.  
Life has improved since then.  Still struggle with finding a reason in this life.  I am more careful to be aware of my thought processes. 
I have lost the joy of living."
