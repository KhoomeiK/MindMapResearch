AskReddit,ffdx05a,t1_ffdmmec,1579831019.0,"Yeah, irl, you ask before doing *anything*. People in porn just start moving into the next thing and smiling at each other like they just cut away from the director saying to do that, but for obvious reasons that's not gonna happen in real life, and I think it's important to know for virgins."

Could it have been that the small sliver of light from the window illuminated his teeth, and he had kicked in his sleep, waking you both up just enough to unconsciously notice? That could be why you dreamed you were petting him, because you were trying to soothe him in your sleep."

fatlogic,fel4srs,t3_enpljp,1579214061.0,What is the purpose of their post? I don't see a point they are trying to make? Are they just trying to get HAES fans used to feeling cutesy about not being able to do basic tasks by surrounding the words with hearts?

bestof,fehiu99,t1_fehetlk,1579117425.0,"Read the online quiz in the linked post- abusers edit: *often* isolate their victims from everyone else, make them feel like they're such shit that no one else could ever love them, and after the yelling/abuse, they're sweet as can be, which confuses the victim and makes them feel like it's all worth it. They probably start out with low self esteem, but it gets worse after being with the abuser, and they feel like there's no way out and no way to live without their partner."
TooAfraidToAsk,fefx5x8,t3_eotijm,1579068134.0,"It actually does make the distress go away.
