Many people trying to find out what the name is, as if it's the Grail…no one ever shares it, and even if they did, it would be a waste of your time and money.

What you need is accounts with drunkenslug and nzbgeek. That's all the paid indexers necessary; couple these with nzbking (search is tricky, but you'll figure out shortcuts and special ways to make it work for you, especially with very old uploads). Files that I couldn't find on drunkenslug, nzbgeek or NZBking were also not on the redacted indexer! Specifically for porn, it is sometimes helpful to also have a keep2share account…yes, it's an extra expense, but what you're getting in just the first hour of downloading more than pays for a year's worth of subscribing to these services."

I'm sure this took a little time, but probably not enough for this 3,500 to solely represent the Celadon shutdown. Maybe I'm wrong, but it sounded like most of those drivers had a safety net appear from nowhere, if they wanted it. FWIW, my friend's company is constantly looking. The problem isn't a lack of demand - it's how many candidates are not really fit for this business, and fail to pass muster fairly quickly after starting."

At the point that they were allowed to acquire Macromedia, there were then no professional level alternatives to what Adobe owned - it never should have been allowed. Today, if you're a professional graphic designer, your only choice is to buy Photoshop and illustrator...except that, since there were no real competitors to turn to, Adobe successfully changed their business model to a monthly lease, rather than the ability to purchase and own their software. This means that most users now need to pay $50/mo - $600/yr - for the rest of their lives to have access to their files. Sure, there have been some small, third party apps that have been created to try to fill a niche - non-professionals on a budget - but there is no chance of any of those apps ever achieving industry adoption. Adobe bought their only true competitor, making their solutions the only possible purchase for industry/professionals, then changed the model so that you now had to lease forever what you had previously been able to buy once and own outright. In this climate, piracy flourishes."
