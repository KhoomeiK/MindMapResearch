 Maybe the Mire is completely mutated and different, with sentient plants and crazy plant monsters. Cranberry bog would be completely blasted out, with deep canyons where the mines collapsed, and infested with RadBats, the smaller, less annoying ancestors of the Scorchbeasts. The forest could be protected by militant conservationists who think it's the last natural green area on Earth. 

If it's one thing 76 did right, it was the map. It's more varied and more colourful than any other Fallout game. I know we love blasted out cities and bleak wastelands, but a new environment or two really wouldn't hurt."

Homeworld took ages to adapt to him being a different person to both Rose and Pink, can you imagine how many pissed off gems are still out there, and how they probably wouldn't accept that he has nothing to do with them anymore?
