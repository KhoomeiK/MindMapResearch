PublicFreakout,ffdzc7t,t3_eswm73,1579832694.0,"In my school, there are a lot of kids of Central and South American dissent and they speak Spanish to each other. So, one day a kid in the grade below me told them to speak English if they're near him and I was shocked by the audacity of that guy. I wasn't brave enough to say anything to him, but I wanted to tell him to screw off. This video has one bad woman, but a lot of good people willing to defend their fellow people from bigotted ignorant racists."

All because one religion is a majority, doesn't make it an ethnostate. Also, non - Jewish citizens are given all the same rights as well as not having to serve in the military, though they can if they want. Do your research before u spread false information."

politics,fdbi3dp,t1_fdb5wv1,1578257570.0,"I have read the Qura'an as well as the Old and New Testaments. None of them are for equal rights. They were written thousands of years ago. I can cherry pick things in the Bible that would say the same, but religion evolves and people don't look at bigotry in those books because it's a relic of the past. They can't just take it out, so most people leave it out of their faith. And I agree that Qassem Solemaini has done terrible things, but he is one drop in an ocean of people. I would not suggest going to Iran, but a lot of the Middle East is open and peaceful. The UAE, Lebanon, Israel, Quwait, and many other countries in the Middle East are very nice places to visit."

He has committed war crimes, lied under oath, threatened foreign countries with acts of war, supported hate groups, has said some absolutely inaccurate statements during speeches, has proclaimed that what he does is ""God's will"", and sounds like a completely uneducated person on a good day.

Don't take my word on how bonkers Trump supporters are, take Trump's word for it.

politics,fdb4ph2,t1_fdb0kxv,1578253783.0,"A.) Most Middle Eastern ppl want peace and to westernize and modernize.
B.) Middle Eastern ppl aren't all ""brown"". A lot of people from the Middle East look white / European especially in Iran.
C.) Many Middle Eastern countries dislike Iran because they are trying to destabalize the Middle East and gain more power in the region through proxies.

You can't make assumptions on the Middle East because of the minority of people that get the majority of exposure."
