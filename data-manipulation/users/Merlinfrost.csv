confessions,ffc1foj,t3_eskb8v,1579789107.0,"In the eyes of a god fearing Christian, you did what most Christians fail to do in their life. You have a man his final wishes despite your opposing beliefs. If there really is a god up there, then you did what mattered most. An action out fo the kindness of your heart. You put somebody else over you, and that’s all that matters."

Also there are dozens of scientific papers that use the word female. Sure albiet sexist papers, still use the word female. I’m just doing what I was taught to do.  Sorry that offends you so much, I don’t know why the term female is seen as derogatory."
