The Dhammapada is the Buddha’s first teaching to the lay person. You can grab that anywhere. Find a good Buddhism for beginners book or a big colorful encyclopedia, those are cool. 

Look up meditation centers and Buddhist temples/monasteries in your area. Websites for those places will also have information you seek about finding a community, Sangha. (Sangha=community)

Go to a major book store. Go to eastern philosophy, find beginners books in there.

Reading anything by Mark Epstien is awesome. I recommend this as a life book not a Buddhism book. Author is Buddhist though. 
He is a psychiatrist in western medicine And has been practicing Buddhism and meditation for thirty years. He blends them together in his sort of life guide on how to solve the problems most people have with their thinking.

This book saved my life. Instead of falling apart, it helped me to take myself a part and put it back together how I wanted.
