ShermanPosting,ffvx9ij,t1_ffvs9ui,1580276091.0,Confederates? This is strictly Sherman vs Metro City of Atlanta.
MurderedByWords,ffvkzyc,t1_ffvkrxl,1580266590.0,"But... it fucking didn’t. 

So far we’ve had links that show one in Perry, GA and one in Alabama. Could you explain why there would be news reports of those billboards in small areas but not a report of this mystery billboard in the largest metropolitan area in the South?

Better yet could you provide proof that it went up?

Until this you guys are just wasting time.

E: and believe it or not, no people don’t just pay for a billboard and it goes up. You realize that city/county municipalities have to approve billboard advertising content right?"
MurderedByWords,ffvka3o,t1_ffvjsqj,1580266108.0,"Northeast of Atlanta could mean fucking Tennessee for all we know like what? No one in the ATL metro area would ever sign off to having some shit like this on a billboard, and even if they did it would be sprayed over in a matter of days.

Just because something is in Alabama doesn’t mean it is “probably in Atlanta too”. That’s an astounding leap to make logically."
MurderedByWords,ffvjfgs,t1_ffvj9oo,1580265536.0,"Yeah I’m so confused why people make shit up like this? Like why couldn’t they just say the billboard was in Perry, which has nothing but rednecks and the State Fair. Still woulda been stupid.

If that shit went up in ATL and was interstate visible, it would be tagged all to hell by the time 5 o clock traffic hit."
MurderedByWords,ffvj9bp,t1_ffvgurd,1580265419.0,"That was in Perry, GA. Which is around 2-2.5 hours from even the outskirts of Atlanta. You guys really want this to be a thing for some reason."
MurderedByWords,ffvj1hi,t1_ffvgj5d,1580265269.0,"Yeah I live in Atlanta as well. People who say dumb shit like this just assume every city in the south is racist and it’s an easy target, but ATL always exposes them.

They would never expect it to be the cradle of not only the Civil Rights movement, but also southern rap. The city has had a massive impact on black culture throughout the nation.

Yes sure, a city that in 2016 had Keisha fucking Lance Bottoms as our mayor is out here OKing pro secession billboards. /s

People on this website speak so much but know so little."

We felt so strongly AGAINST the Monarchy/CoE we literally moved to an entirely different continent then kicked your fuck asses back to England. 

I see the resentment still runs strong."

CFB,ffuu5t5,t1_ffutds6,1580249394.0,"I partially agree with you on the last part but you also have to realize that many of the schools have pieces of history that help explain why they never made it into the SEC/ACC etc. 

Take my school Mercer University for example. We used to play UGA/Tech/Miami/MSU back in like 1936. When the War happened, the Mercer sports teams effectively shut down due to students shipping off to war. As was usual with most smaller, private schools at the time. The UGA’s, Miss St.’s of the world I am assuming had the students left to continue to field teams (I’m assuming, haven’t done much historical research on their programs.)

So the stratification, at least at my school, happened due to practical reasons, not simply because we weren’t invited to the rich boys club. It’s easy to see it as black and white but you must always remember that these teams are not simply a standalone team you select on NCAA, but are fiscally and practically tied to institutions and student bodies as well."
