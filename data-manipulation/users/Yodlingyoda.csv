TheRightCantMeme,ffgbker,t1_fffmosh,1579902626.0,Apparently we can’t afford universal healthcare because it costs too much to keep those “low IQ idiots” in line even though we’ve got the world’s best equipped military in history. So maybe we’re the real idiots.

AsABlackMan,ffcnyh7,t1_ffcnqt8,1579803498.0,"I’m just curious as to how you’re not seeing the connection between “she clearly did X because of Y” and “I would know because I am also female”

One statement depends on the other. If she’d said “she clearly did X because of Y” and “I would know because my shoes are blue” it would make no sense."

WitchesVsPatriarchy,ffcngxg,t1_ffchun5,1579803195.0,It’s hilarious that they deleted it but they were quoting a bible verse about Christians never having to be judged or some shit— conveniently forgetting about the ultimate judgement of “eternal bliss” vs “eternal torture”

AsABlackMan,ffccom5,t1_ffcb4n3,1579796600.0,"It’s not impossible, but to attribute it to her because of her gender alone is pretty crazy. Plus she didn’t say, “it could be ___” she just completely dismissed the idea that this unknown (and possibly imaginary) woman might possibly have a good reason for being angry due to gender alone."
AsABlackMan,ffc2qlb,t1_ffc1qc5,1579790077.0,"Sounds like you just don’t know that much about people. Everyone’s complicated on the inside, and people who fit stereotypes are breaking and stretching things within them to force the fit. That’s why you’ll often meet people who seem ‘perfect’ but after spending enough time with them, realize that they’re fighting their own insecurities harder than they’re fighting the rest of the world."

Anxietyhelp,ffbtqjg,t3_espdrb,1579782419.0,"When I do this, I try to think back to remember a time when they (or someone similar) did something awkward or embarrassing in my presence and usually I can’t or if I can it doesn’t change my feelings towards them at all. Then I realize we’re all just awkward apes bumbling around, hoping we’re reading the room right. Even ‘charming’ people are never sure if they’ve made the right call in social situations, but they don’t let it keep them from trying again."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,ffbti61,t1_ffbsj3w,1579782177.0,I guess it’s hard to control people through guilt over normal human needs/desires when they learn that repression and punishment are unhealthy.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffbs5zm,t1_ffb6z5j,1579780688.0,"Yeah, idk why everyone’s acting like it’s a coffee shop’s job to be caring for the homeless in the city. It should be the job of homeless shelters, but the only way to increase funding for those is to raise taxes which no one wants to hear— then suddenly it’s “not my problem”"
BrandNewSentence,ffbqsx2,t1_ffah3y7,1579779014.0,"Sounds like straight up projection. You know absolutely nothing about this person aside from her gender and that she doesn’t like it when her bf ‘lies’ to her dog, which could mean anything. The fact that you’re assuming so much from so little really says a lot about you."
wholesomememes,ffbq9o1,t1_ffb86s6,1579778310.0,"Yeah, I’ve been dealing with anxiety and depression since I was a kid, and I always just assumed it was just something fucked up with me personally.. for so many years I thought I was alone in feeling this alone, but when I finally came to terms with the state of my mental health I realized how obviously broken my thought processes were, and how common. 

I work in the mental health field now so I can help others like us because I think the most insidious part of the disease is that it makes us think we’re the exception, and therefore beyond help."
wholesomememes,ffaurr3,t1_ffal8q3,1579744965.0,"Unfortunately that’s just how you have to treat your brain until it’s strong enough to handle reality without crashing. Like the other person said, we do need to parent ourselves a bit, teach our scared little brains that it’s okay to fall down and scrape a knee, and the world doesn’t end when we can’t have that treat right away."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffagskb,t1_ffabuse,1579735395.0,"Because fewer words sometimes don’t do the trick. If you use ‘big’ words where they’re not needed just to sound smart, people pick up on it pretty easily. Ask any high school English teacher who’s graded tests full of synonyms for the single syllable word they were meant to replace.

If you’re saying, however, that education has often been a means of discrimination and control against the masses by the ruling class, then yes, you’re totally right."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffaabbw,t1_ffa5s9b,1579730972.0,"I mean.. it’s meant to teach you a skill you may need for work/school in the future. If you never need to write professionally then great, but a lot of jobs require that you at least know *how*"
