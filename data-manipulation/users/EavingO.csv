If you don't want to chemically stabalize then your best bet is exactly what you suggest, get a yeast with a tolerence at or below your desired ABV, ferment it dry and then add honey to back sweeten.  Keep in mind yeast is a living thing and that target ABV has a bunch of variables built in, so I would suggest starting with your expected honey needs, but once it has stopped add honey to the sweetness you desire but leave it a bit and make sure it doesn't simply start fermenting again in any case."

  Secondly, and not really their fault, we used to have a local beekeeping supply store that eventually opened up a dedicated mead shop here in Portland.

  Having said that pay attention to the nutrients section of the wiki.  You can get away without them, but a good nutrient regime will be the difference between something you can drink in 3ish months and something that will need a year or more of aging.  Old recipes will refer to raisins as nutrients.  While they technically add a \*very small\* amount, it is essentially negligible.

blackmagicfuckery,fdmxbqa,t3_em5eho,1578570022.0,I mean its bad enough that you let it see you without burning it and then salting the ground you buried it in just in case.  But you shot a video of it and now its seen all of us as well....
Homebrewing,fdljs87,t3_elzohn,1578525605.0,"As others suggested check out r/mead.  Oxygen in the must is actually a good thing in the first few days, just bad once the fermentation starts to die down.  You are likely seeing a slow ferment due to lack of nutrients.  Honey has basically no nitrogen that the yeast needs to grow.  Consider picking up some Fermaid O or K(or in a pinch boiling some baking yeast).  Really old recipes will often refer to raisins as nutrients, but they don't add any meaningful amount of usable nitrogen."

mead,fdl9up4,t3_elz3li,1578519516.0,"Besides the reason that u/PatrickNLeon already gave there is also the fact that most meaderies are highly regional.  I live in Oregon in the US and even someone posting from California or Washington would likely have a mead I couldn't easily find in my neck of the woods, much less someone from the midwest or the east coast.  Having said that I do still enjoy when someone posts about a mead they just found and will always google where it is from just in case I can easily find it here."
