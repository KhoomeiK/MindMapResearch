Dogtraining,fff3ixy,t1_fff26ob,1579874736.0,"Yes yes yes. Sweetness has nothing to do with it, bites happen. The behaviors he is doing are precursors to biting. Being off leash is not worth him getting in another fight or biting a kid, he needs to be on a leash and get the training mentioned above"
reactivedogs,ff9yuxy,t3_esgzrl,1579724449.0,"I have a similar situation, my 2 bits of advice: for the love of god do not let him off leash in a park. A hack that I do is I bought a 15 ft lead (also have 30 ft but I prefer the 15) and when we go to trails/parks that is what I use. She gets way more exercise than when on a standard 5/6ft lead and you can work on recall. I do this with my girl and even if I just walk, she gets 3x as much exercise because she has so much more freedom, but is still not loose. As for your partner, it's unfortunate that he isn't as patient as you. I would stress to him that it's understandable for him to be frustrated but the things he suggest are really not viable options for your situation"

psych,ff61x22,t3_erv1y8,1579617047.0,Love LOVE that part. I also love the end when gus walks through his office to quit while super bon bon plays
Connecticut,ff60h44,t3_erujp5,1579615952.0,Ugh these other comments are ones I'd expect on the North Carolina sub (I moved recently) not from blissfully blue CT. I can understand having issues with any candidate but to say Bernie is going to ruin the US is such a joke

reactivedogs,ff4sf1s,t3_erm30i,1579571322.0,"I would say something to your family, definitely be happy with Sasha but they still ignored your sign and it seems like there is a very real chance that someone could have gotten hurt. Maybe I'm just a little touchy but I cannot stand it when people ignore my wishes with my animals, even if it's benign. It can be harmful and dangerous and I think being upset is perfectly justified."

Wolfdogs,fezv6ja,t3_er0cyt,1579462075.0,"No no no no no there are several red flags in this post. Read up on them, they are sooo much harder than a regular dog and in wayyy more ways than just needing tons of exercise. They are very difficult. Many areas have laws that don't allow them. Finding a real wolf dog is rare anyway, people often get malamute/shepherd/husky mixes which are also difficult dogs"

Dogtraining,feponky,t1_fepbcas,1579326246.0,Yeah then why not right?  My opa used one for his high energy rescue mutt and it was great
Dogtraining,fepa9qz,t3_eq9z5x,1579315656.0,Eh depends on your situation. Do you have disposable income? Is there a reason you can't do outdoor walks?
pigs,fep95gc,t3_eq50z9,1579314927.0,Is he crate trained? I have driven multple 16+ hour trips with my pig and one of the most important things is feed them very very little if anything at all because they will throw up. Bring cleaning supplies and extra bedding for them. If yours is leash trained I recommend letting them out at rest stops if they are really sick. It also helps to go at night because they are sleepy

personalfinance,fekueqt,t3_epnj4g,1579207811.0,"The professor shouldn't have told her that but it is still on her. Plus, at least at the 2 colleges I have attended, they are usually super up front about drop policies. Typically a full refund is available if you drop before the class starts and half is available if you drop within a few weeks or so. After that you're screwed."
reactivedogs,fefc04r,t3_eov8gz,1579053006.0,"Hmm sounds like a decent idea, I would keep in mind that it's unlikely to be a total fix and I would DEFINTELY do a trial of some kind"

Dogtraining,fe7b9xq,t3_eo08wh,1578912416.0,"How long have you had her? While these behaviors are troubling if it's only been a few weeks or even a month or 2 it could get better when she fully adjusts and sees you and your house as home (typically takes 3 months). Either way, if you can afford it I would consult a trainer that can come to your home and give you an unbiased interpretation and provide some insight"
pigs,fe6kfdy,t3_enufpo,1578893822.0,"Yes and no. The BARE MINIMUM an appropriate set up outside (proper shelter, plenty of space, lots of enrichment). However, there is certainly a case to be made that having him live outside without any companionship is cruel. Pigs are VERY social animals and he would essentially be in solitary confinement if he is out there with no other life form, let alone another pig. My pig may eventually live outside but not until I get a 2nd. I'm not sure what situation you have but there are potentially lots of ways to protect your house from him, ranging from training to adjusting your current setup a little bit"

Dogtraining,fctjpde,t1_fcteco1,1577945679.0,"Personally I'm all for that, the most blissful walks I have with my dog are when we are working on muzzle training (shes not aggressive, unrelated issue lol) and people want NOTHING to do with the hannibal dog. If some false advertising is necessary to have a life without pee, I say go for it!"

pigs,fcookwy,t3_ei836l,1577837457.0,"Oh boy.. that's gonna be a biiiiig pig. Also in my informed opinion, a pig that isnt spayed or neutered is never going to be a good pet, especially in a house. Pigs need daily training to keep them from being total tyrants, her behavior would improve if she were spayed IMMEDIATELY and worked with every day- try having your MIL look up programs like Push the Pig"

dogs,fckwf21,t3_eho07v,1577734649.0,"Short answer: depends on the depressed person and depends on the dog. Personally yes, but I am pretty high functioning; plus my dog is a project, but her issues aren't that bad either"
Wolfdogs,fcfpg95,t3_eh223d,1577632484.0,"Woah, I mean you won't know til you get your dna but I think she is looks similar to my dog. I joke around and call mine a fancy coyote but i know she is just a shepherd x malamute. Also small, about 50 lbs.
