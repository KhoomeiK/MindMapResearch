confession,fgsq01y,t1_fgspcbr,1581090176.0,"Cbd doesnt get you high but the effects of cbd and thc together are very different than vaping cbd oil when he is used to maybe 30%thc and 70%cbd  and he is smoking this weed and turns out this strain is 10%thc and 90%cbd he is not going to be used to that much cbd and probably wasnt expecting that type of high. His not making excuses at all, he made a mistake and even if he was sober I'd be saying the same thing. Guy just missed his train and the right thing to do is to let him sober up and call an uber for him"

confession,fgspaeq,t1_fgsbfye,1581089734.0,Weed is different for everyone. Personally I can barely take my phone off charge. It slows your reactions down and if he made a wrong step into a road thatd be game over

confession,fgsowew,t1_fgs8dgi,1581089488.0,What? Accidentaly missing a train? A friend wouldnt put another friend in a situation where they're possibly homeless for a night
confession,fgsor4q,t1_fgs7yjk,1581089397.0,Marijuana is different for everyone. Personally I can use my brain but everything else is very slow including my legs. Imthe strain could also be very different to what his used to and if he is used to high thc and had high cbd there is no way he would be able to calculate that much of a different high. I think as a friend the right thing to do is let him sober up then call an uber or taxi and ask for the money the next day but I guess common decency doesnt matter anymore
confession,fgsog2x,t1_fgs60yp,1581089199.0,I'm not tryna make excuses for the guy but each strain of weed is different and there is a possibility he coulda had something he is not used to. I'm reading this whole thing as the guy just missed his stop and she is assuming it's a tactic to stay. I dont believe that's the case personally just seems like guy misses stop and as a friend if that happened to one of my friends I would let him sober up then call him a taxi or an uber then ask for the money back when he can and I think personally it's a dick move to leave someone outside possibly homeless for a night
confession,fgsnzxv,t1_fgs5ugl,1581088913.0,Fam all I'm saying is the way it works is not how people are trying to portray it at all. The guy may not do it too often and the strain she had may have been very different from what he is used to. I'm not saying he has to spend the night but let him chill in the living room until he is sobered up because thats what friends do
confession,fgs5t6n,t1_fgs4wip,1581073026.0,Thank you for putting it bluntly
confession,fgs3v0a,t1_fgs3ow1,1581070220.0,No ik not saying he should expect I dont see why you're so angry. Weed isnt all the same and especially in a place where it is illegal most people can not not tell the ratio of THC to CBD so he may be used to high CBD from his dealer but this could have been high THC which is a very different experience. With alchol the alchol level is on the back. This is a reason why weed should be legalised but as far as it goes she isnt obliged to do so but as a friend it's common decency

confession,fgs32bg,t1_fgs2xtn,1581069026.0,The high hits you instantly maybe the weed was stronger than others hed experienced. Guy just sounds like he missed his train. It happens to alot of people. A high lasts a about 2hrs it would be common decency to make sure he is safe. It's what a friend should do
confession,fgs1w46,t1_fgs1upa,1581067308.0,I never said it's her responsibility or obligation I'm saying it's common decency you dont leave someone outside in that state
confession,fgs1s7o,t1_fgs1ly8,1581067148.0,While i agree he is at fault to a degree for missing the train what I'm saying is it's common decency as a friend to let him chill out til he can at least be aware of whatever the fucks going on. No one should wander the streets high unless his a stoner and it doesnt effect him as much bc it's not safe
confession,fgs1k4h,t1_fgs1gyw,1581066821.0,"That doesnt mean he was smoking the whole time. When I'm high I can barely focus on walking, time management is on a whole different level of shit to focus on, especially if he doesnt have a strong tolerance"

We also need to take in account the strength of the weed and his tolerance. It is common decency to help your friend"
confession,fgrzx3f,t1_fgrs9t1,1581064538.0,"I think calling it manipulative is a bit far. He was high af I'd hope if someone was inviting me to smoke and I missed my train to at least let me sit in the living room while the high wears out so I can safely wander the streets if i am gonna be out there for the whole night. That's just mainly common decency, she doesnt have to obviously but it would be the normal and nice thing to do"
