As you already admitted, it’s exactly how antivaxxers and others think and reach such wrong and dangerous conclusions. Your own mind can reach all sorts of “logical” conclusions.

Man landed on the moon in 1969. There are too many contemporary and expert people reporting this as a fact. That’s why I mentioned PhD studies and not some article from blahblahblah.com. Nor would I trust some expert’s interview with blahblahblah. Knowing who the experts are and how to get the information from them leads to understanding the right information and how to get it."
