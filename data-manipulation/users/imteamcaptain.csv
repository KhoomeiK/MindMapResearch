I don’t know if this is great advice but one thing that motivated me to get help is my family and especially my mom. I’m incredibly lucky to have had a ton of support and after everything she’s done for me I felt I had to try to get healthier so she wouldn’t be so stressed about my wellbeing. Eventually you need to do it for yourself though so this is only a temporary motivator. Of course you deserve to be happy man - just as much as anyone else does. No one deserves to live with depression."
classicwow,fcycdsp,t1_fcybafo,1578077986.0,Lol this dude is so full of shit
wholesomememes,fcy8r1a,t1_fcy3rvd,1578076434.0,"I can only speak from personal experience but I really didn’t feel that different while on medication (I was on Zoloft generic). I still felt like me but just way less anxious and I didn’t feel nearly as depressed as I had previously. I know some people do feel weird though on Zoloft so it depends on the person. 

Also it definitely wasn’t a band aid solution for me at least. The medication allowed me to get new perspective on my depression and anxiety that has stuck with me since I stopped taking the medication and given me far more control over my life. 

You’re correct there are some unknowns given these are new medications but with what scientific data we have we know that these medications can absolutely help people who are in your situation. There also hasn’t been any evidence shown of negative consequences that would make the medication not worth it compared to the benefits so I strongly encourage you to research more and schedule a meeting right now with a professional who knows more than we do."
wholesomememes,fcy2zy8,t1_fcxoebz,1578074052.0,"I understand your hesitation around medication but I would strongly encourage you to at least discuss it with a professional as an option.  If you don’t like how it makes you feel you can always stop taking it but medication has saved many lives of people who were in situations very similar to your own. 

There’s no stigma about taking medication for physical health and there definitely shouldn’t be any for taking medication for mental health either. Also you won’t be on them forever likely - just until youre in a more healthy mental state."
classicwow,fcxzpom,t1_fcxqxka,1578072714.0,I’ve done so many trib runs but this is the first time Ive seen the lip tip when FD resists... ty bro that sounds super useful
classicwow,fcxnmjg,t1_fctot8t,1578067223.0,"That’s fair - id say I make over 100g per hour not selling any loot so respec costs I only view as 30 minutes of work. I don’t respec for raids yet though - how significant a dps loss is it going down survival instead of beast mastery?

Also it sounds like you don’t have enchanting if you’re only making 10-25g per run? I make 25-45g I would say. Your gold per hour will increase drastically if you get it."
classicwow,fcxmwy6,t1_fcxekc4,1578066760.0,"You cant send soulbound items to your alt to disenchant so you need enchanting on your hunter. 

Each run you’ll get 3 blues and 2 greens from the chest and 2 blues from king gordok (all soulbound). Unless the blue vendors for more than 2.5g (the price of a large brilliant shard on Fairbanks AH) I’ll disenchant it for a profit (some vendor for less than a gold so that’s 1.5g profit right there).  I usually disenchant more than 50% of the blue drops. 

The soulbound greens are even better since you can get greater eternal essences from them which sell for 5-6g each and I always disenchant these. You can also get greens from large solid chests after clearing the instance which can also be good to disenchant (you should have an add on like auctionator that tells you whether to disenchant or not based on you servers AH prices)."
classicwow,fcupmps,t1_fcujo7n,1577985974.0,Hey man - if you are going to take the advice in this thread and pick up engineering for tribute runs then you should definitely get enchanting instead of mining. This will greatly increases your gold per hour in tribute runs and turns it into the best gold farm in the game. You can just buy mats to level engineering on the AH for a couple hundred gold and you will make that back in a couple hours once you’ve learned how to do tribute runs. Just a heads up though this is probably one of the hardest farms to learn in the game and you’ll die a lot before you can do it consistently.
classicwow,fct2p8g,t1_fcsfsnn,1577931319.0,I would say it’s mandatory to maximize gold per hour. Yes you can recover from FD resists but it’s not always possible and dying is a huge blow to your gold rate. I don’t think having pathfinder makes up for this personally.
classicwow,fcrvrlj,t1_fcru5zi,1577907282.0,"It will be way easier to farm pre raid bis if you are willing to tank. You’ll find groups much faster and can reserve items which people wouldn’t let a dps warrior reserve. 

Tanking is also the most difficult role in the dungeon but if you watch a couple guides and respec the recommended fury prot spec it’s really not that bad if you take it slow. You’ll also sort of be expected to know the dungeon pulls so watching a sped up run before isn’t a bad idea. 

If you want to just dps you can do fury or arms for dungeons but fury is better and that is your raid spec. It’s gonna be incredibly hard to farm pieces like HoJ or SGC if you just dps though."
classicwow,fcrt8zr,t1_fcrr0np,1577906309.0,I mean it doesn’t have to be an entire expansion all at once. They can do the OSRS method of adding new content gradually that gets voted on by the community
classicwow,fcp9lt6,t1_fcofqwq,1577855236.0,"Man I couldn’t disagree more about warriors feeing clunky. With stance dancing not activating global cool down you just have to press way more buttons than most classes to do efficient dps and once you get the hang of it you have such precise control over what you’re doing.  

It’s frustrating since warriors are definitely one of the higher skill cap classes but once you learn damn is it satisfying."
classicwow,fcp5ivn,t1_fcp41bb,1577851138.0,"Confirmation bias is a powerful thing my friend. I was told by a hunter doing sub 8 minute trib runs (Workingtorpedo) that Los helping fd Chance is just a myth so there definitely isn’t universal agreement from experienced runners.

Also FD will get resisted if you get hit in same spell batch that you feigned so that may explain why you find non-los’d fds so unreliable.  When mobs are out of range to hit they don’t resist often at all when not los’d."
classicwow,fcom54x,t1_fcojju1,1577835696.0,I was told that was just a misconception on the community’s part but I’m not sure. It’s at least still possible for mobs to resist FD when LOSd but I cant speak to whether it reduces resist chance.
classicwow,fcogd0d,t1_fcoce94,1577831570.0,Your combat log shows how much happiness your pet is gaining per tick so you can tell there. I don’t think there’s any benefit from using higher level food though.
classicwow,fcoch4s,t1_fcnz72i,1577828864.0,Ok I did some research. Non bosses only have a 3-4% chance of dropping key so I’m not sure whether it’s worth it to kill that first ogre each run. Even bosses only have about a 13% chance to drop.  However there is a mob called the Gordok Bushwalker who spawns after you loot ogre tannin and patrols the platform the tannin is on. He has a 25% chance to drop key but I don’t know how you would loot the tannin before finishing the dungeon and having ogres deaggro. I’ll have to test whether you can kill him if you loot tannin after boss kill but I doubt it.
classicwow,fcny5u0,t1_fcnrx7r,1577820720.0,Is this worth it to sacrifice a blue every tribute run though? I know you can get really valuable patterns but it also slows down your runs a lot having to kill the first boss.
classicwow,fcnx4ac,t3_ehhv7z,1577820178.0,"Hey do you happen to play on Fairbanks? I’m also a hunter trying to farm SGC for my warrior alt so we could help each other out. 

Wishful thinking but thought I’d check!"
classicwow,fcmioxk,t3_ehy25y,1577776857.0,Trib runs are much better gold so i would just spend 5+ hours practicing that until you have it down. Just spec MM to trueshot and survival to improved FD. Also use a wolf with furious howl.
classicwow,fcmih19,t1_fcmhl9z,1577776592.0,Why would a warrior ever tank a non endgame dungeon if they can’t roll on dps gear? Tank gear is useless when you’re leveling unless you’re just spamming dungeons to 60
classicwow,fclwmjq,t1_fcll15x,1577758254.0,Lol you’re not kidding. Ive seen multiple posts from hunters asking what the hell to do with all their tribute gold.
classicwow,fclwhe6,t1_fcleuk8,1577758156.0,Not sure how well screech works but furious howl is a godsend especially for getting to the boss as fast as possible.
classicwow,fclpyut,t3_ehte56,1577753639.0,Since you’re rolling on a new server I’d go hunter. You’ll be able to farm gold way more effectively than if you were a shaman.  Also hunters are super fun to play and can solo a lot of content.
classicwow,fcjd9r2,t3_eh8vte,1577683645.0,I make bank with enchanting but I’m also a hunter who can do trib runs so it’s really not as profitable for most other classes.
classicwow,fcgg9gq,t1_fcgd6ml,1577639654.0,That’s your internet not the picture quality.
classicwow,fcfo0hs,t1_fcf5op6,1577632107.0,Ngl having meme specs in my raid that actually min max sounds pretty fun. Hard to find players willing to put in the time to do it though.
classicwow,fcfne0u,t1_fcd35de,1577631958.0,Yea they hit for 3k each so unless your a tank you’re gonna get 2-shot if you’re unlucky and get targeted twice.
classicwow,fcfmgzk,t1_fce8nd8,1577631685.0,What percent of guilds actually have both bindings though? We’ve been raiding since like week 3 and have no bindings but 3 eyes...
classicwow,fcflz79,t1_fcf53i5,1577631513.0,Yep I agree there is resentment towards classic. They don’t like that the original game is so much more popular than what they’ve turned it into and they just want people to switch to retail and start dropping $25s on cosmetic mounts... it’s never gonna happen blizzard.
classicwow,fcfljdv,t3_eh44hw,1577631344.0,Has there been any talk of blizzard opening up new servers? Launch was one of the coolest gaming experiences of my life and I’d love to be on a fresh server again but on the other faction.
classicwow,fcbaqkv,t1_fcaxzi0,1577584569.0,That’s fair - I’ve never been in a turtle longer than 30 min personally but I don’t do a ton of AV. Also short games may be more efficient but who wants to sit in queue for 30 minutes just to play for 10? Some people just want to pvp for the enjoyment of it.
classicwow,fcba670,t1_fcarvns,1577584365.0,I get it man - really. Im on Fairbanks and stopped attacking ally in phase 2 since I genuinely felt bad for what y’all were going through. I admit I get a little defensive when people generalize about all horde players but you definitely have a legit grievance with a lot of us.
classicwow,fca8h36,t3_egt1kk,1577564668.0,Why do ally’s on this subreddit act like all horde were doing the flight path ganking during phase 2? It’s probably less than 20% of the player base that did it and were trying to rank (including plenty of ally’s who were doing the same thing) but you act like anyone who plays horde was a camping asshole during phase 2.
classicwow,fca7pm5,t1_fca57jb,1577564311.0,"With a full rotation I go oom right at the end of rag kill before he submerges including using greater mana pot and dark rune.  Hunters are definitely one of the most mana intensive classes but being able to FD and drink helps as well.

If you want max dps you do +1 agi but if your guild is in any sort of progression int or Stam is much better imo."
classicwow,fca73vj,t1_fc84p4k,1577564038.0,Man phase 2 really hit some of you guys hard lol
classicwow,fca5jg1,t3_egtd5a,1577563366.0,Believe me we’re not any more organized and I imagine it’s just as dumb as what you hear on your side at the start of matches. We just have more incentive to defend and farm rep/honor in a longer match since we have to wait 20+ minutes to get in the BG.
classicwow,fc9u1ga,t1_fc9p27d,1577558216.0,"If this is your main I would just sell it. You’ll replace it soon anyways with quest bows (e.g. cliffrunners aim) so the gold is more valuable for you at this point.

Also unrelated but I suggest you level with a owl or bat. The screech ability generates a lot of threat and is aoe so you can pet tank multiple mobs much more easily."
classicwow,fc6hu55,t1_fc5eono,1577480924.0,Even without selling any loot DM Tributes are still the best farm in the game I believe. A good hunter will make between 100-150 gph if they have enchanting and can do 15 minute runs consistently (that’s not counting extra drops like Forors or transmute undeath to water from chests).
classicwow,fc6fp82,t1_fc58f3a,1577479484.0,Am I correct that all of those issues except shared DR are due to spell batching?
classicwow,fc6d0nz,t1_fc67kj9,1577477685.0,Check out zeroji on YouTube - dudes doing sub 7 minute tribute runs which is insane.   Getting to the boss consistently in about 5-6 minutes should be doable no matter what gear your have.
classicwow,fc64n6y,t1_fc5mxdp,1577472173.0,You actually don’t even have to wait if you’re using a wolf. Just run out and as soon as they aggro you use furious howl and they will switch to your pet.
classicwow,fc64hc9,t1_fc5ko0d,1577472068.0,I used to use a cat with prowl but switching to a wolf with furious howl made my runs sooo much more consistent. It’s pretty much a get out of jail free card if mobs get on you since they run off to attack your pet.
classicwow,fc4r7j5,t1_fc4qt1b,1577425453.0,Materials to craft thunderfury - legendary weapon that requires two 3% drops (the bindings) from MC bosses which you can only kill once a week.
