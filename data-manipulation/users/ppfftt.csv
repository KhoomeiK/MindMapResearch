science,ffdh508,t1_ffdfziy,1579820753.0,"? That’s quite the stretch from talking about the definition of mass shooting in the research article. You also have no idea that the person you made that comment to would be a part of a family that was killed. Like I certainly don’t think my spouse’s immediate family should have all been shot to death by a family member, and I don’t think that should happen to any family. My spouse’s family were all killed with a legally bought hand gun by a member of the family that had not shown previous signs of any mental illness, so no gun restrictions would have helped prevent their killings.

The point of my comment is if we are going to talk about mass shootings and how to prevent them, we need to define what we are talking about better so that we can make sure we are all talking about the same thing."
science,ffd953b,t1_ffcruwa,1579815851.0,"Your comment actually displays part of the problem with discussing “mass shootings” in general. This research defines a mass shooting as “the fatal shooting of four or more people in one event, excluding offender suicide, regardless of shooting location (public or private), relationship between the shooter and victims, or whether the shooting was part of a different felony crime.”

The majority of mass shootings aren’t the ones you are talking about in your comment. They are crime/gang related or domestic related. We hear “mass shooting” and think of a random act of violence perpetrated by a random individual against a crowd. In reality it’s more often that it’s a member of a family killing multiple members of their household."

At the time that I frequented, the owner also owned a pub in Ireland, and would bring staff over to the US for months/years to work in his US pubs. Most of the Irish staff were from Galway, so I think that’s where the Ireland location was. 

They had authentic pub quiz nights with the same questions as asked in the Ireland location, which were quite difficult if you weren’t up to date with Irish and U.K. current events and pop culture.

Makeup,fd61u55,t1_fd5wnr7,1578184372.0,"Ah, I shop at Sephora more, but if I could only shop at one I’d choose Ulta for the breadth of their selection."
HaircareScience,fd5tzog,t3_ek27dr,1578181492.0,Bumble and Bumble Don’t Blow It. It’s designed for air drying and comes in two weights depending upon the thickness of your hair. I didn’t think it did all that much until I ran out of it last week. My hair is so puffy without it and just looks unkempt no matter what else I put on it.
Makeup,fd5senj,t1_fd5diid,1578180968.0,Why choose? Can you not shop at both?

SkincareAddiction,fd33dzj,t1_fd2rzlj,1578154378.0,Lactic acid is the key ingredient in all the different lotions that treat this condition. With how much skin people tend to need to cover I think the lotions would be cheaper in the long run. They’d last so much longer than a tiny TO bottle and wouldn’t cost too much more to begin with.
AskAnAmerican,fczfwg4,t3_ejfqm8,1578100359.0,"Not considered rude where I’m from and I’ve worked in a few salons. I have a lot of hair, so my cuts take a while. I read magazines and look at my phone all the times, and so do most of the ladies I see around me."
FODMAPS,fczfgu7,t3_ejhfji,1578100085.0,"I’ve had two gastroenterologists tell me it that you can have a reaction up to three days after you consuming the offending food, but that was in regards to what triggers IBS flares and not FODMAPS specifically. The longest I’ve had a reaction take was 48 hours, however that was a food that constipated me, so the reaction likely started way before I was aware of the issue."
todayilearned,fcvz317,t1_fcvkzph,1578013380.0,"Not the same as scones. American biscuits are much softer and flakier than scones. It’s surprising that McDonald’s doesn’t introduce the American biscuit sandwiches to their UK breakfast line-up. The UK breakfast menu is significantly smaller than in the US, and the biscuit breakfast sandwiches really are the best items on the US McDonald’s menu."

GERD,fcvd21q,t3_ej2svw,1577999555.0,"If PPIs do not help, and scoping shows no evidence of acid reflux, it’s odd that gastroenterologists would continue with that diagnosis without further testing. You need ambulatory pH monitoring and esophageal manometry."

Makeup,fcule2t,t1_fcuknlq,1577983556.0,"I would love to trade lashes. I bet yours do not require regular plucking nor interfere with wearing any sort of eyewear! 

I am constantly on the hunt for the right mascara and wear lots of different ones from drug store to high-end. I loved L’Oréal Voluminous for years, but my skin changed to more oily a few years ago and it stopped working so well for me. Clinique Naturally Glossy pops up regularly in my rotation, as well as Blinc tubing mascara. 

I tend to go for more basic formulas that just darken slightly now, and don’t add thickness or length, but finding one that doesn’t clump or flake is difficult."
Makeup,fcukbh6,t1_fcuk86x,1577982930.0,Shedding lashes is normal though. They go through the same growth cycle as the rest of the hair on your body.
Makeup,fcuk773,t1_fcujvh3,1577982863.0,"Maybe. I’ve been wearing mascara daily for 25 years and haven’t had any issue. I do have crazy thick abundant dark long lashes though, so my lashes might just be hardier. I would actually like to have shorter less thick lashes!"
