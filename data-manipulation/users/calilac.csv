My therapist is amazing at rephrasing without changing the meaning which has helped me to truly examine my self-talk and work on changing it for the better.

My therapist, btw, is a student. A local university offers weekly sessions based on income ($5 a pop in my case) otherwise I couldn't afford it. If anyone reading does consider this option I recommend cautious optimism and full disclosure of diagnoses so they can place you with someone appropriate. And remember that you can always ask for someone else if you think it's not a good fit."
