I had a problem with the assistant on my fossil gen 5, uninstalled the google update and it's worked fine since then.

Apparently the latest google update messes up assistant so we just have to wait for the next patch."
WearOS,ff9wet8,t3_esdkei,1579722976.0,"The gen 5 of you buy in store you can join Fossil Club (or similar name) and get 15% so that's £230 something here in the uk. I don't know if it works in other places but it's worth to see. 

The gen 5 was slightly too much but all of the features you get with it I did manage to stretch and in very happy with it. 

Apparently Fossil products do go on sale rarely often so if your no rush might be worth waiting for a sale"

The battery was my main concern and I actually asked about it on one of my smartwatch subreddits and got a fair few responses so check out my posts to find what other people think"

If you want a better and a more accurate reasoning I'm sure theres city planning subreddit you can check out"

Alternatively get a watch with a speaker and microphone so you can call on it and just call your local minicab firm and you'll be alright. If your wanting a watch that you can do these things without your phone will mean having an LTE watch. 

Ive mentioned it before on this sub but checkout r/WearOS theres a google sheet with all the specs of all the wear OS devices. However I'm not sure if it's the right platform for you as if your wanting to listen to music from your watch the spotify app won't let you download music onto your watch even if you've got premium.

chemhelp,fek480a,t3_epl5qc,1579192261.0,"The 4s and 3d subshells are of very similar energies and so it makes complicated.

The 4s subshell fills up before the 3d but also empties first.

It them gets more complicated when you get to Chromium. Instead of 4s having 2 electrons and 4 out of the 5 3d subshells being half full. One of the 4s electrons is moved to the empty 3d orbital, so all 6 orbitals are now half full.

Something similar happens at copper, instead of 2 electrons in 4s and 9 in 3d one is moved to 3d. So it becomes 1 then 10. 

Sorry for the poor explanations, you'll be able to find better explanations online with diagrams."

I cant remember how old I was but it was probably around 7, 8 or 9 age and I was waiting outside at my sisters swimming lessons, reading a book or something similar when an older kid probably around 12 started saying stuff about my birthmark. I cant remember what he was saying but it was making me visibly upset and which point this kid started to say more stuff when out of nowhere another child who was probably around 15 backed me up, nothing physical but the mean kid quietly walked away, at which point I ran inside.

I wish i got to at least thank the older kid but it's good to know that there are decent, well raised teenagers out there who back up those who cant back themselves up.

All of the ages are very approximate as I cant remember the details very well.

tl;dr: I was being bullied by an slightly older kid when  another kid backed me up."
