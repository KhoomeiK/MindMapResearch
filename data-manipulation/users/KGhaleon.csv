He would ask me if I heard it and I told him he was crazy, we're nowhere near the beach. He would ask other coworkers to listen for the noise and I always turned it off. It would go back on when nobody else was near him. Dude was literally putting his head up to walls and trying to find the source of the sound for days.

My boss is a pretty cool guy and it was harmless enough so I told him about it after my coworker started losing it. Now the boss tells this story to all his friends."

The mouse connected to his computer behind the cubicle wall and the mouse was under a stack of papers on my desk where noone would notice it. He was close enough that I could see his screens from my chair.

I would mess with him whenever I noticed he wasn't looking at the screen....open random windows, move those windows from one monitor to another, change his volume, etc. Dale was confused but must have thought he was doing these things by accident. One day he was turned away and chatting with one of our coworker friends(Jay). I proceeded to open like 50 windows and Jay noticed what was happening and connected the dots...dude almost choked to death from laughter when he saw the hidden mouse. The rest of our office mates found out and nobody lets me touch the mice anymore."
