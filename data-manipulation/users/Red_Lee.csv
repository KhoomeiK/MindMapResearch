I didn't get the praise either. It was OK. Leo and Pitt were good but the story just drudged along, I was waiting for something to happen and by the end of it all I was like OK that's funny and now I'm never watching that again.

I didn't think the cinematography had much effort behind it, either. Very average movie all around."
PUBGConsole,ffrgr2b,t3_epzdng,1580157731.0,"Feedback:

- The black zone is a cool mechanic, even after I died immediately after dropping. I dropped late and landed on a roof that the very first missle hit. Some people might complain about that happening too soon, but I think it's perfect for the urgency you're pushing with Karakin. I say keep that timing as-is, I got a good laugh out of it and just marked that loss up to the PUBG gods.

 - Glider mechanics seem really great and intuitive, but please have them in Training mode. It is very difficult to land in a tight area (as it should be) and I would like to work on that.

 - Please make healing/boosting in vehicles easier. If I remember right this has something to do with vehicle damage on consoles, but you guys need to figure out how to make healing slightly easier. Even driving steady in a straight line can cancel a bandage. That's bunk. I can chug an energy drink in real life as my jeep bounces around rocks.

 - Add a refuel mechanic to the loot drop plane, where you can fly the glider to the plane and refuel mid air to a trailing fuel line. Would cause some hilarious air combat."
