AskReddit,fcc39tt,t1_f7col7q,1577593918.0,"So I live in Florida, United States. My mother's house burned sown in 2009. She had NOTHING left. No Identification. Nothing. In Florida (at that time) you need:

An ID and social security card to get your birth certificate 

A social security card and birth certificate to get an ID

And an ID and birth certificate to get a social security card. 

My mother had none of those. It was a nightmare trying to figure out how to het those things. Had to call governor's office and explain the situation and have them call to make an exception."
AskReddit,fbx2ehk,t3_eetf7i,1577166663.0,"When I was about 3 and my brother was about 1 and a half, I took our family pet bunny out of it's cage and put it in my brother's crib. Then I got the butter out of the fridge. I also put that in his crib. Then I climbed in, too. Then my brother and I proceeded to butter the bunny. And each other. And the crib. And everything within reach. Including the wall the crib was against. My parents gave the bunny a new name. He was known as ""Butter"" from that day forward. 

I was a strange kid. I also used to hide american cheese slices in the canopy of my bed. I did not like american cheese as a child."
