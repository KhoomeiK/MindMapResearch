I hope that as this ends I learn to feel free like you guys rather than shackled and insecure. And that quote about your true life beginning once you realize you only have one is gorgeous. It makes so much sense.
thyroidcancer,fefdo63,t3_ehlnrt,1579054090.0,"100% yes. Thyroid cancer made 2018 and 2019 the worst years of my life, and messed up my first two years of college. I had to be talked off the ledge so many times. I still have the damn cancer after 2 surgeries and a round of radiation, and the surgeon predicts I will for a little while.


as sad as it makes me to admit, I don't think anything good came from this. There's always the fact that it led me to where I am now, and while I'm not happy with my current life, my future is bright. But I genuinely don't believe having the cancer led me to that bright future. I think I would've ended up there anyway, and faster. So cancer for me is just a horrible detour."

tifu,fdkz8lo,t1_fdjv0ty,1578514217.0,"Dude. there's a massive difference between me talking about masturbation, which everyone does, and you asking to see my masturbatory device, which only creeps do. If it was a joke, I'm sorry for taking it seriously. I've gotten a million creepy DMs seriously asking me to.

I understand it was a message of support, but you should understand I'm allowed to say your religious support is not warranted by me (or by any other ex-Christian atheist I know). As an ex-Christian, when I complain about Christianity, the last thing I want to hear is the tired phrase ""well you just met a bad Christian. Us real ones are better/closer to God/etc."" It's annoying, to be frank, because I hear it a million times, and it's never been true. I WAS the real Christian. It's condescening to imply I have no clue what real Christianity is like when I've been a worship leader in both a Pentecostal church and a contemporary non-denominational church. I've met hundreds of real Christians and still know dozens.

I apologize for being angry. To be completely honest, your comment was my breaking point on being told ""he just isn't a real christian."" I've been told dozens of times at this point, but shouldn't have let my annoyance build up until I unloaded it onto you. I just want you to learn how inappropriate it comes across to an atheist. It'd be like if you said ""I don't know what God is telling me lately,"" and I kindly said ""That's okay, you probably don't hear him because he doesn't exist. You'll figure it out."" It comes across as rude no matter what the intent was."

tifu,fdfvba0,t1_fdfqhsu,1578371171.0,"Your comment makes absolutely NO sense and makes you look more like a fool than it does me a racist. Btw, I'm hispanic, grew up poor, frequently deal with racists. I'm assuming you think I'm a privileged white.

I did NOT say all Christians are the same, I said ALL PEOPLE WHO CALL THEMSELVES CHRISTIANS ARE CHRISTIANS.

There is no such thing as a ""real"" Christian and a ""fake"" Christian like that commenter was saying. Anyone who calls themselves Christian and has a personal way of practicing, is a real Christian. Now, there are nice people and mean people, but they're all still Christians.

It's extremely shitty to say that someone who is devoutly Christian just isn't in your mind because you don't like the way they practice. It invalidates something they assign theirself as, and you have no right to tell someone what they are and aren't. That's like saying someone is or isn't a ""real"" black person because of the way they act. No matter how you feel, they're still black, and you're just an asshole asserting that everyone in a group must act one way."
tifu,fdflydv,t1_fdfg38l,1578364772.0,"first of all, you disagreeing with the no true scotsman fallacy doesnt make it false. The fallacy isn't about the fact that people abuse the virtue of a group by claiming to be part of it, it's about the fact that you will insist those people are simply CLAIMING to be a part of it rather than THEY ARE a part of it. capitalizing this so you get it: THEY ARE JUST AS CHRISTIAN AS YOU ARE. They believe just as much as you do. They are EXACTLY LIKE YOU. It just led them to a different attitude. But you are BOTH legitimately Christian, whether or not you wish they weren't.

Second of all, that dildo comment? I'm sick of you perverts asking someone who's barely legal to SHOW you something private of mine so you can fantasize about it or whatever the fuck else."

It is rebellion, but I didn't want to call it rebellion in the reddit sense of the word (which is what I thought you were implying, I apologize).

tifu,fdcqkji,t1_fdcox6f,1578281562.0,">Comments such as ""Hail Satan"" and the admission that you're part of a group that has the word ""Satan"" in it. Satan may not be real to you as a malevolent being, but he certainly is to your parents, so the things you say come across as a big F you and a middle finger behind their backs.

That's the point. It's a middle finger to the part of society that has literally traumatized and controlled my part of society for centuries. I'm sorry if standing up for myself and demanding that I no longer be mistreated on a daily basis for being gay, an atheist, or a woman is ""edgy"" and ""rebellious"" to you."
