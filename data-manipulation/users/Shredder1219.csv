I feel like it would be better suited for r/cats or r/aww because it’s still a picture of a beautiful cat. Anyhow, sorry for your loss OP. He/she was a majestic, beautiful cat, and I still want to thank you for sharing."

Bitcoin,ff05idv,t1_fezq26o,1579465388.0,"There are different positions on the political spectrum. That’s what I’m talking about. I’m not talking about the two party system that plagues US politics. If you honestly believe only one side is corrupt, that there isn’t corruption in both sides, then you need to take a step back and consider all the evidence against these heartless politicians that are in control. It goes beyond fuck you for being a Democrat or fuck too for being a Republican. Greed and power are the only factors at work in modern politics, and if you think otherwise you are a blind optimist. So go ahead and wave your big blue flag, idc I’m neither I think both majority parties are trash. The threat of censorship and manipulation of speech for nefarious reasons is what I am concerned about."
Bitcoin,ff02qhk,t1_ff01g99,1579464535.0,"Oh, so I’m not the nut for being against censorship and the weaponization of language? If that’s what a nut is by your standards, then I’ll gladly take freedom over the tyranny that you support. It shouldn’t even be a partisan issue, and here you are arguing against a constitutional amendment and in favor of the deliberate obfuscation of truth."
Bitcoin,feyydai,t1_feyts5j,1579451990.0,"If you’re on the right it doesn’t automatically mean that you do either, or support either, of those things. Neither does it mean that you support those who are in power, who claim to be a Republican or democrat. It’s also one thing to claim that you are for something in vain, which I feel so many politicians do in order to get elected. 

A politician can promise people wealth, happiness and security but it doesn’t mean that  they will follow through with bringing about any of that. That is only your conception of what the right represents. I could cherry pick, and present biased claims against the Democrats as well"
Bitcoin,feynqez,t1_feyls03,1579448055.0,"You lost me after white supremacy, avocado boy. There is diversity in thought on the right as well. It’s naive and reductionist to think otherwise.  I’m speaking to the fringe left that has gained a foothold in the Democratic Party. Not all Democrats weaponize language, and use censorship to silence their opponent but there is a vocal minority that seeks to do so under the guise of being “morally superior”. 

Wtf are you talking about less money to organize? There are corporate candidates on both sides (Warren, Buttigieg, Biden, Harris) that receive a shit load of money and from Super PACS that practically choreograph their every move. The only grass roots candidate I see on the forefront of the left is Sanders, and look at how they treat him in the media. Unfortunately his time is past, and he’d be lucky to yell his way through an entire term without keeling over of another heart attack."
