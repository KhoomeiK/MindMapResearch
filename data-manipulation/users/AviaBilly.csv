I know life is hard but we both know that you don't really wanna die. Kevin Hines survived the Golden Gate suicide and he was able to tell his story. I suggest you to watch his story here:

Story talking about it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcSUs9iZv-g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcSUs9iZv-g)

If you don't feel understood by many people, there are suicide hotlines to help you.

I know the conversation can and will be difficult but we both know that crisis passes: 

 **1-800-273-8255** 

If you live outside of the US, search up: <your country name> suicide helpline on Google.

Hopefully that helps.

Everything is going to be fine, message me if you need anything.

SuicideWatch,ffbt5fj,t3_esnoka,1579781807.0,"That's exactly what I usually think. I'm gonna be honest: I'm not very social which causes a lot of bullying which made me into a deep depression since I was 10 years old and ever since stuff happened in my life last year, it caused what made me the person I am right now.

I sometimes really wish there was a button that takes to a lobby full of people who needs help and try to maybe ""start fresh"" somewhere in life and hopefully be a bit more respected."
