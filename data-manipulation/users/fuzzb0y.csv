canucks,ffft5kp,t1_ffdtf2k,1579891242.0,"I am talking about it from the NHLPA perspective, this is the first thing they will argue against. They will objectively look at it from a league perspective, and it would add hundreds or thousands of minutes of additional ice time overall. There would definitely be additional injuries over that amount of ice time. I understand why I or you would like to see this because it is fun for fans, but the NHLPA would definitely oppose this."
canucks,fffsz3o,t1_ffdx0ax,1579891130.0,"Playing extra hockey over a long season whether it be 3 on 3, 4 on 3, 5 on 3, 4 on 4, 5 on 4, 6 on 5 or 6 on 4 definitely adds to wear and tear. Even with no hitting there is the risk of crashing the net or twisting an ankle on shitty ice that's been churned up for 3 periods already. 

Playing at the ASG also adds to the wear and tear concept in that it takes away a player's time to be able to physically recover. Players have literally said they are quitting on the ASG because they want to recuperate."
canucks,ffdasl5,t3_eszta8,1579816846.0,"The problem imo with extending 3 on 3 from the NHLPA perspective is the higher risk of injury and wear and tear over a long season. I can understand that. Most players nowadays are already reluctant from attending all star games to recover, rest and prevent any risk of injury."
canucks,ffcuehh,t1_ffctvms,1579807462.0,What a snipe!
nba,ffct3pu,t1_ffav5gh,1579806706.0,/r/nba is pretty fucking toxic. Most of us are pretty good but there definitely seems to be a higher amount of sour apples in here than other sport subreddits.
hockey,ff7j2js,t1_ff7h4da,1579650723.0,"IMO another part of it is that it simply isn't as popular among minorities, and it competes with a lot of other more popular sports. There also aren't many hockey super stars that are minorities.

Also on another interesting point, who would be the best hockey player ever that is a visible minority? Iginla? Kariya?"
hockey,ff79m2i,t1_ff5b5dv,1579643951.0,You can't deny that you would take Pettersson and Hughes over Tkachuk any day right. We are talking about 2 elite players vs. 1.
hockey,ff79kco,t1_ff51ja7,1579643915.0,"Yeah but he's been mediocre before then, elite last year, and mediocre the year before."
hockey,ff4cxey,t1_ff3pwxr,1579560661.0,"Change that to 2013 then I would agree. It's not so bad at the end of the day, they only prolonged the suffering by 1-3 years or so."
hockey,ff4ctzn,t1_ff4b6k6,1579560597.0,"To be honest, if we took Tkachuk, we might not have Pettersson and Hughes."
hockey,ff4cqrp,t1_ff430ff,1579560542.0,I'd say they make it up enough by being great puck cyclers and at maintaining possession. Enough that they would be decent second liners for most teams other than the deepest ones - at least in their last year.
hockey,ff4c4s9,t1_ff3ffae,1579560136.0,What's up with Toews? Is he actually playing subpar for stretches and then lighting it up at random weeks? Or has he just been unlucky and is bouncing back?
hockey,fezvc9r,t1_fez6lh4,1579462134.0,To be fair I would take Bergeron/Marchand/Pastrnak over Malkin/Rust/some lucky guy any day but that's because Boston stacks its first line.

hockey,fex7ctf,t1_fewok6c,1579425926.0,"Jesus, he has always been. It's not like Loui deliberately plays like shit. He simply just became a shittier player through a combination of age and previously non compatible line mates. His hand eye coordination and his hands may be slower and deteriorated now, but he still plays the same. He is simply just a shittier version of himself before, except his offense has fallen off the threshold to be top 9 caliber now."
hockey,fex75f2,t1_fewv03a,1579425775.0,"Just because you're small doesn't mean you don't hit. Kyle Connor last year had 66 points and 9 hits. Does that make him useless? 

I am not defending Loui but just saying that hits isn't a good indicator of his playing ability. He normally simply never hits. E.g. had 34 hits in his 60 point season with Boston."

hockey,fewnqs8,t1_few4d9u,1579416064.0,"Holy shit, he is a genius."
hockey,fewnp84,t1_fewnh60,1579416015.0,"I think he is definitely playing better than the beginning of the year, but I wouldn't use the lack of hits as an indicator of effort or play level. I mean if he was Lucic or Backes and wasn't hitting, that would be questionable. It's not like his style of play is physical and involves hits. He is more of a positionally sound player that goes for the dirty greasy crease goals and rebounds."
hockey,fewnbrt,t1_fewi1se,1579415592.0,"Not too bizarre. People keep crapping on Eriksson because of his salary, but he plays hockey like an elite defensive winger with very little offense, so he is still an NHL caliber player. This allows Pearson and Horvat to take on the more offensive duties."
hockey,fewn9aa,t1_fewheuk,1579415515.0,Yeah but is he any different though? How much could he have changed over 40 games.
hockey,fewn69q,t1_fewjfez,1579415423.0,Exactly what I said. But it explains why some people aren't a fan of him.

hockey,fel3ool,t1_fekpqec,1579213378.0,"Intent to finish a check but not intent to injure. Either way Virtanen should be responsible for where his elbow flies and that is a textbook 2 minute penalty. Also, I don't think Virtanen is known for being a dirty player, physical yes, but not dirty."

TheRightCantMeme,fekie34,t1_fejnn6g,1579200679.0,"Not a fan of the royal family at all and frankly I’m sick of all the Meghan Harry shit, but that’s just an inaccurate statement.

hockey,fek8w8l,t1_fejsxn3,1579195048.0,Yeah but how many of those times were wildly underperforming compared to their advanced stats? It’s clear the VGK front office is a bunch of old school boys who doesn’t see that. VGK is dominating in advanced stats.
hockey,fejd5zm,t1_fehyrso,1579168164.0,And also the medical history as well
canucks,fehvcqj,t1_fefyx78,1579124606.0,At the same time it’s tough on a team to be a bottom dwelling team. The mentality should always to win as many games as you can. The only things I would change are maybe some of the FA signings to allow us to play younger guys or have more crap flexibility and to avoid losing picks and prospects in trades (although I think JT was worth it)

canucks,feecovl,t1_fedxq76,1579031037.0,"Acknowledging the more tumultuous era they played in, I would put them somewhere in between Kassian and Torres (Cooke would have been Torres category but he seemed to have cleaned up his act a bit in the latter third of his career)."
canucks,fed1fxv,t1_fec1q3w,1578993884.0,"What the hell, Loui is definitely helping. Pearson and Horvat can focus on offense with a dependable defensive winger in Loui. He is overpaid by 4.5m in that role but he is an effective line mate"

canucks,fecbapo,t1_fec11kl,1578970050.0,I don't think so. There is a difference between players like Kassian/Burrows/Roussel and Torres. The latter is a straight up sociopathic serial killer. Tkachuk imo is trending into that category.
hockey,fecazbt,t1_fec0v1e,1578969868.0,"Would you say that it's a borderline hit that would not get called in some games, as in this game?"
hockey,fecaxrf,t1_fec26b5,1578969843.0,Absolutely agree.
hockey,fecawts,t1_fec9dxg,1578969828.0,I think it was a borderline hit. I wouldn't disagree with you if you said charging.
hockey,fec09ca,t1_febxa4y,1578964814.0,Both players should be penalized. Too bad it’s tough to penalize Tkachuk for a hit that’s [edit: arguably] technically legal [edit: and borderline] but violates player safety unnecessarily and custom.
hockey,febjzdb,t1_feajdyh,1578959636.0,I get that we should acknowledge Neal's dirty hits but this is simply just character assassination. What he says is right and we should agree with it.
hockey,fe9oo6e,t1_fe3n5fb,1578940058.0,Slowmo isn't accurate when determining the actions or intentions of players because of how quickly everything actually happens in realtime. I completely empathize with Kassian in this situation. I think Tkachuk didn't target the head but he absolutely was reckless and should be penalized somehow.
hockey,fe9od3f,t1_fe2jbei,1578939946.0,"Absolutely. I would regret it for the rest of my life if I did not stand up for myself. Too bad Tkachuk turtled. You go out of your way to hit a player over multiple games and years, fight or turtle and get ragdolled, super star or not."

The first point of contact may be the shoulder but the principal contact was the neck or head area. Tkachuk was definitely targeting Kassian and raising the stake. Kassians reaction was expected but wrong.
