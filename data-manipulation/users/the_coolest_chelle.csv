u_VanishedChicago,ffj4rdw,t3_etuzka,1579990370.0,It’s now a Binny’s! Thank you for sharing.
chicago,ffg0ms7,t1_fffwvon,1579895891.0,Not really worth posting again.
Floribama,fffo7t0,t1_fffnyuy,1579888193.0,[insta](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7O0mCmFoVF/?igshid=ujy80mqf3puu)  and the part about her wanting to get arrested to get kicked off the show is in the article we are commenting on.
Floribama,fff384t,t1_fff0uuc,1579874496.0,"I might get hate for this, but I feel like at that point she was trying to get arrested. Her Snooki moment. On her IG she’s selling merch with her mugshot on it.  

Edit: read the article. She wanted to get arrested to get kicked off the show."
Floribama,ffe3u3s,t3_et48pr,1579835984.0,What???? Noooo!!!!!! She’s my absolute favorite of the group!!!!!
chicago,ffdgvit,t1_ffdcvaj,1579820596.0,"I got threatened with eviction (Lakeview high rise - major management company) for smoking a flower vape. Totally thought I was safe, nope. Still had a smell but I never really realized it ."
chicago,ffdgj0j,t1_ffdfdcw,1579820392.0,"I got threatened with eviction this summer for smoking a flower vape in my Lakeview high rise. Major northside management company. I broke the lease and GTFO. 

Good times."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,ff7whf7,t3_es3fb7,1579660010.0,"It’s weird thinking that most of the OG and TM2 girls started like Briana - living paycheck to paycheck trying to figure out how to balance work, school and being a mom. 

If Y&P has a long run, in a decade will we see Briana taking month-long vacations in Hawaii?"
chicago,ff4m6dv,t1_ff46nec,1579566974.0,Thank you!! Will post again this weekend - I didn’t realize we aren’t allowed to post pictures on weekdays. Weird!
AskReddit,fent1i0,t3_eq1wzh,1579290344.0,Magically losing 100 pounds without giving up the food I like.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fejlxtf,t3_epflb0,1579179355.0,"Michael has to know what she does on those yachts. How does he just sit back and let Sophia go with Farrah? I understand she’s his cash cow, but come on...that’s his super young granddaughter. Farrah is going to auction that girl off to the highest bidder."
ChicagoNWside,fejk1xr,t1_feji4pt,1579177472.0,"That would be amazing. I’m thinking the Chicago Park District handles that, but it seems like the EP Chamber of Commerce is really active, so they could be a good place to start?"
chicago,feidwpo,t1_fehzpqk,1579136240.0,"It sounds like you had a pretty amazing childhood and even more amazing parents who had both the time and money to give you those experiences. Especially since they were able to drive such a far distance for the zoo, A LOT. You call it cheap, I call it fortunate. Nothing wrong with that at all. 

As to your final comment - you can believe what you want. Where did I make this whack comment about real Chicagoans?? Oh wait, you made that up. Cool, bro. 

There are plenty of Southsiders like me on this sub, we are just extremely underrepresented for a myriad of reasons. I guess it’s hard for me to convey what it’s like to consistently see ignorant comments that pretend like no one lives south of the Loop. And then, when there’s some kind of article about the Southside, those same people suddenly remember it exists, try to defend it like they have any fucking clue, trying to out virtue signal one another. 

You keep claiming that all you said that LPZ is prettier and easier to get to for *most* people in Chicago. It’s right there in your original post. That is pretty ignorant and I think the downvotes reflect that. 

You are welcome to reply but I will neither read nor respond. 

Thank those cheap parents."
chicago,fehys6e,t1_fehtnc9,1579126595.0,"You’re clearly white based on your username alone and you explicitly stated that the backdrop should factor into zoo choice...but sure, that was just a narrative that I built. 

I see what you’re trying to do by referring to your parents as “cheap” - there’s a cute (privileged) narrative for you. 

Those are the same “cheap” parents that “always had a membership” to the zoo,  right? 

Come on, man."
chicago,fehszrp,t1_fehpixd,1579123270.0,"Naw, you just grew up in a white suburb where apparently things like that matter. 

I can’t expect you to understand how the rest of us make our decisions, but I can assure you that things like a zoo backdrop are pretty low on the list."
chicago,fehp6mt,t1_fehlnul,1579121096.0,"Friendly reminder that Chicago is not limited to the north side and north suburbs. 

Do you think the average Chicago family factors in  “the backdrop” when deciding which zoo to visit? Or is that some rich white people thing that I don’t know about?"
chicago,fehksbf,t1_fegy5gb,1579118556.0,"Even if you take the the el, you’ll still have a long walk to get to the zoo. And 100% agree on the landscaping! Though I love the architecture at Lincoln Park."
chicago,fehkimm,t1_fegxx3w,1579118402.0,"I grew up on the Southside and didn’t get to visit LPZ until I was an adult, specifically because it is such a pain to get there. Your post boggles my mind."
chicago,fehj6ms,t1_fegv64h,1579117627.0,Isn’t that where Jack Hanna is based? Would love to visit.
chicago,fehj0ux,t1_fegu8ms,1579117534.0,"Shout out to Henry Doorly!! I wish more people knew about that zoo...it’s amazing. Every time I visit Omaha the zoo gets better and better, and I feel like it was perfect the first time I visited."
chicago,fehifaz,t3_ep51tp,1579117184.0,Sounds like she did everything right but just didn’t pick the “correct” candidate.
chicago,feg5dna,t1_fefqpy2,1579077698.0,"I would expect nothing less from a young, white northside guy."
chicago,feezvlp,t1_feetmfw,1579044900.0,"Yeah, don’t smoke those"
chicago,feeh8m6,t1_feed4x4,1579033706.0,"I 100% agree on the white elitist thing. I would just argue that those white elites mostly live in northside neighborhoods (so much Lake View flair)  but grew up in the suburbs or out of state (in suburbs). 

I would guess less than 1% of this sub was both born and raised within city limits. 

Just out of curiosity - what is a “normal” Chicagoan view, in your opinion? 

Edit: I downvoted you from Chicago :)"
chicago,feedqdg,t1_feed5ss,1579031648.0,"Didn’t answer my question, but sure.

And I don’t mean to come across as argumentative, I just find it amusing that you think conservative white-collar workers are putting in all this OT on the Chicago subreddit. 

A simple look at top comments would show you otherwise."
chicago,feecwdm,t1_fedw6yl,1579031159.0,You really believe the people who consistently post all day on this sub are conservative white-collar people?
chicago,feeb5vy,t1_fedvf8t,1579030144.0,"You must be new here. Have you even glanced at the top comments under this article?

Even slightly conservative comments get downvoted after a few hours. I posted this earlier but this sub is almost exclusively young, white northsiders (when have you seen a picture that *wasn’t* the Loop or northside?). 

That’s a very liberal demographic."
chicago,fee81u0,t1_fedtxe8,1579028316.0,"No way we are in the same sub. Sure, some conservative comments are made on most articles that are posted, but after a few hours those posts are usually massively downvoted. 

It’s almost all super young, white northsiders here (when is the last time you’ve seen a picture posted that *wasn’t* the Loop or northside?). Decently liberal demographic."
todayilearned,fedg61o,t1_fedclsg,1579010638.0,"If someone includes an insult while discussing something, then I no longer feel the need to be objective."
dogswithjobs,fedcnav,t1_fec9m5q,1579007700.0,"I completely understand that overwhelming feeling...know there is a community you can turn to in the good times and the bad. I will admit there are times I do not look at posts because I know it will just upset me, but other times I go there to feel less alone. Love your pupper, btw. 20/10"
ParkinsonsCaregivers,fedc2lu,t3_eohfpi,1579007185.0,"Nope, but weed just became legalized where I live and I was wondering what kind of products I could get that might benefit my mom?"
todayilearned,fed8fk4,t1_fed88r1,1579003570.0,"Not when it comes to pedophilia, sorry. You took the time to defend the guy."
todayilearned,fed85m7,t1_fecgrxw,1579003254.0,"It means if you’re gonna get on a high horse and make a snide comment about reading the dictionary, maybe you shouldn’t also be making comments about *dads sneaking into their young daughter’s room for sex*.


Lemme guess, you’re cool with pedophilia and incest?? 

Clearly his comments don’t bother you. 

What the fuck is wrong with people?!"
dogswithjobs,fec9ite,t1_febsb5z,1578969058.0,"You’re welcome to join us at r/ParkinsonsCaregivers if you haven’t already!! If you ever need help or resources, I really recommend checking out the Parkinson’s Foundation!!"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,febiohg,t1_feaprjq,1578959248.0,Thank you for validating me!! Seriously...as much as she irks me I always think it’s important to acknowledge her shitty upbringing.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,febi5hp,t1_feautuw,1578959072.0,"I remember reading some “behind the scenes” article in a tabloid. The TM camera crew folks opined that Kail was the best mom overall. This was at least 5 years ago, but I can believe it. She had to figure out how to truly do things on her own...she does not have any family to fall back on. Even Jenelle has that."
Floribama,feamtc5,t1_feaaugt,1578950392.0,Omg stop you’re making my palms sweat just by mentioning Scott’s Tots.
