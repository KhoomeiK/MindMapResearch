depression,ff2990k,t1_ff28yw5,1579497568.0,"What about when that’s over and you’re no longer busy? Because while I feel my sadness and loneliness disappear when I’m preoccupied, the moment I’m done is when those feelings rush back and attack me even harder than before."
FIFA,fezf07i,t1_feyq77n,1579456643.0,"I use regular shots when I shoot with my Kante. As a deep lying box to box, he’s always in position to score, yet it’s hard because I always find him on his left foot. If you shoot on his left, you won’t score. But his right foot blasted near post is something incredible."
depression,fenhcqt,t3_epym4o,1579284708.0,"Happy belated!

My birthday was yesterday too and I forgot about it until I had to provide my date of birth to my ISP. You made it another year, aim for another one!"
FIFA,fejykho,t3_epibpm,1579188780.0,"My first FIFA was FIFA 12 (I was a junior in high school) and I was actually introduced to it through a female friend’s dad. He taught me how to play and the controls how to not hold the shoot button in order to score. We played a series, best 2 out of 3 and I went and bought the game the very next day. But I didn’t get into ultimate team until FIFA 17. Up until then it was all online seasons and playing with my friends."
FIFA,fe6flbl,t3_enwdc9,1578889415.0,I went 11-0 and stopped. No bad gameplay or anything but it started to feel more like a chore than anything else. Those who play all 30 every weekend are wild I tell ya.
FIFA,fdxm4s9,t1_fdxkv0t,1578770524.0,"Maybe so. I only shoot with him when he’s open. One shot was WAAAAY over the bar, while the other one in the back of the net. I’ll continue to test where I want him to be. It would mean I’d need a different defensive minded icon to replace Veron."
FIFA,fdxkrmd,t1_fdxkdph,1578769864.0,He actually banged one in on his left foot with defensive pressure on him. That play alone sold me on him as an attacking option.
FIFA,fdxk6wy,t1_fdwllrb,1578769540.0,"I play him as a CDM paired next to mid icon Veron with a Hawk chem-style. He’s everywhere and nowhere at the same time, coming out of nowhere to make plays. I keep him on stay back and aggressive interceptions, but I am tempted to move him to more of a box-to-box creator role since his attacking stats are so so good."
FIFA,fdqccm9,t3_empjo9,1578662829.0,I got lucky and pulled TOTY Kante the only upgrade pack I did (the New Years one).  I’m not doing another one.
FIFA,fdpifet,t1_fdphs3x,1578629479.0,I’m still gassed. I’ve never pulled someone of this caliber.
FIFA,fdpiehk,t1_fdpi2c0,1578629459.0,I legit thought it was a UCL card but the gold tint on the sides put me on the edge of my seat real quick. He and 91 VVD will be in my team for the rest of the cycle.
depression,fdds2ox,t1_fddm6im,1578322516.0,"Thanks, I appreciate it. The relationship itself wasn’t one way by any means, and we were very happy with each other. The love was there and I thought it was strong on both ends until it wasn’t. We were both working towards a future together and we had each other through ups and downs. And maybe if I expressed these feelings I have for her during the rough times we were together, things would be different. 

But I didn’t and things didn’t end the way either of us wanted. What sucks even more is that she’s with someone else now and everything that I want to tell her will fall of dead ears. And like I said, if I’m not good enough, then so be it. It’s just a lot of energy and time and effort that I’ve put in for something that genuinely made me feel wanted and needed and watching it slip through my fingers have left me feeling empty and lost."
FIFA,fd7mbny,t3_ek7j40,1578206672.0,"I have his first IF as a red pick. 234 games, 238 goals and over 130 assists if I remember correctly. My favorite player in real life and he’s a monster for me in-game."
FIFA,fcyohzf,t3_ejhf9g,1578083902.0,"I have 1.2 million on Xbox to make a team around these untradeables: IF Van Dijk, IF Fabinho, SIF McGinn, IF Doherty, FUTMAS De Gea. The formation doesn’t matter, as long as I can transition between a 4-2-3-1, 4-1-2-1-2 (2), and a 4-3-2-1. Thanks!"
FIFA,fcyn7wh,t3_ejj61h,1578083203.0,"I’ve been super lucky this year in my red picks and my good friend hates me because of it. I’ve gotten Elite 3 and Gold 1 once each, and the rest have been Gold 2 finishes for several weeks now. 

My picks were IF Werner, IF Lewandowski, Fabinho, Van Dijk, Allan, Gnabry, and Doherty. All but Gnabry are used because I have his POTM in my main 11."
FIFA,fcp1spk,t1_fcp143e,1577847852.0,"I’ve really enjoyed it. I’ve mostly used a High pressure tactic with attacking fullbacks since you’re not punished as harshly for doing so. It’s been a lot of fun. 

I think that once I reach Division 1, I’ll start using more teams and their tactics to see if I can bring any to Ultimate Team."
FIFA,fcp1op1,t1_fcozylv,1577847756.0,"I used Liverpool for most of it without changing any default settings. High press with attacking fullbacks led to a lot of opponent mistakes and easy opportunities (and a lot of rage quits). As of late, I’ve been using PSG just so I can practice skill moves in a competitive setting."
FIFA,fcp1l9s,t1_fcoyree,1577847672.0,"It was a tough pill to swallow, especially since I was around 23-0 when it happened. Chances just didn’t go it and the two he had just worked. Same thing for the draw I have. A lot of chances I had in the box just weren’t going in, and I should have won in the end but I rushed a shot in the 90th. It happens sometimes."
FIFA,fcoxk1d,t1_fcoxemx,1577844338.0,I’m in Division 2 but I don’t play rivals during the week very much. I comfortably get Gold 2 and give away the remainder of my matches. My highest WL Rank is Elite 3.

FIFA,fch60zo,t3_eh7frb,1577647622.0,I packed mid Lampard this week and decided to start Kent instead of paying for a high rated winger. This man is rapid on the wings and has secured numerous wins for me this weekend.
FIFA,fc2ano1,t3_efs7o7,1577348935.0,"Div 2 Rank 3 — mid Lampard untradeable

Gold 2 — Allan and Gnabry as my red picks"
FIFA,fbwskfd,t3_eeufh0,1577158307.0,"Ter Stegen at 254 games, but he currently rides my bench. IF Lewandowski will overtake him at some point as he’s currently at 204."
