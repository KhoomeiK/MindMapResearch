Look up recipes for standard fare.  You'll be using those same ingredients to make some tasty shit in no time.  Just this past week I made some chicken piccata to die for.

On the co-op front we have Arkham Horror, Forbidden Desert, Pandemic, and Aeon's End.  Arkham Horror is too much of a game to digest right now so we shelved it until we are more experienced.  Forbidden Desert we found to be far too easy and not varied enough.  Aeon's End almost hits that sweet spot of learning curve vs difficulty level.  Pandemic is fantastic and we also ran through season 1 and will get season 2 soon, taking a break.
