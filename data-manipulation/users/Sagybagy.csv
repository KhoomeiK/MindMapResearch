Cars on streets should be allowed if the street is wide enough to allow two cars to pass each other inside of two cars parked on the sides.  So four cars abreast of each other.  Curbs should also not be rolled curbs in that instance while kids are kept on wider sidewalks.  Unfortunately that doesn’t happen.  Only one car can pass and side alms are not big enough.  Curbs are rolled encouraging kids to move seamlessly into the street like it was normal.  Yeah people should teach their kids to not run in the street.  But people should also be taught that painting your house Raiders colors and parking broken down cars in the front yard should be a thing too.  But here we are."

My wife works with special needs and from what I have gathered that is not out of the ordinary for kids or adults with disabilities.  As we all know it feels good but know not to do that in public.  If they have a problem processing certain emotions it might be the reason.  I would ask that the child be looked at by a professional doctor.  Even though the wife has done it for 20 years I don’t know the correct terms to use these days but I would expect she is further down the spectrum and that is her tick.

He lives about a 1/4 mile away and I smell his BBQ when I drive down the street on weekends.  His wife works with my wife.  

Best part was that when we got it narrowed down to same neighborhood he was ecstatic and started yelling at his wife, “Honey!!  This guy lives down the street!  I told you they were real people!”"

Browns,fe4hyjm,t1_fe3rohj,1578859525.0,Because running the ball successfully and at will opens up the passing game.  He might actually get open instead of being strapped by a DB the whole time with a safety hanging in the area to help.
Browns,fe4gkhu,t1_fe43loj,1578859121.0,"I would not put Lamar above Rodgers.  Lamar was a stud this year yes but that’s just this year.

Dude is a freak athlete no doubt.  But his decision making and arm talent are not there."

Curious about your opinion.  Because he failed as HC in his previous attempt and hasn’t done anything significant outside of being able to call plays for Brady.  Who has to be one of the easiest teams to coach on with BB running the show.
Browns,fe4b5w8,t1_fe3xdxb,1578857484.0,Yeah.  No idea how we didn’t have Arians.  Dude was practically begging on air while calling the game to be the coach.

He said he was going to put me on every list so I would constantly get called.  I explained that’s fine.  It takes less than a second to answer and hang up.  No money or anything out of my pocket.  You however, end up wasting time while I’m screwing with you and your out money.  Possibly a job because your bosses review how long you have been on the phone with no positive outcome.  And to boot you called in an illegal fashion so keep them coming buddy.

As that moisture is redistributed places like desert start turning more tropical.  It’s the extreme opposite end of ice age is tropical age.
