Keeping my comment up though."
personalfinance,fff6mfn,t1_ffexgv9,1579877041.0,"I would argue that the urge to pay down a debit is an emotional response that should be ignored. Instead: Can you make more money in the market than your current interest rate? Do you have an adequate emergency savings cushion? If the answer to both is yes, invest / save your money & only pay the minimum on your debts. 3.75 is a great low rate! But your money can probably do better elsewhere — put it to work for you."
personalfinance,fff5zyb,t1_fff1v5j,1579876586.0,"Keep the pet, but remember that pet insurance is only like $35/mo. Why not have best of both worlds? I had a surprise $1500 issue with my puppy a few months ago, then ended up paying only like $200 to cover the co-pay and a small put-of-pocket expense. I think we have nationwide or one of those major insurance companies."
financialindependence,fff54yp,t1_fff3gvx,1579875951.0,"Just because it happens doesn’t mean we need to internalize those same unhealthy habits. I’m a naturally competitive person and sometimes feel jealous reading these posts, but I also know that anonymous people on *Reddit* of all places should not trigger unhealthy feelings. Competition is good yes, but this is not the time nor the place — it’s just a community forum."

Washington,ff58stz,t3_ernhyr,1579583648.0,I’ve lived all along both coasts of this continent. The PNW (I’m including Vancouver Island here) has by far the best sunsets anywhere.

Leatherman,fe6mf21,t1_fe6ixqg,1578895874.0,"Just installed the same mod and couldn’t be happier. My bit holder was stiff too. Bits are held in by those thin strips on either side of the tool. If the holder is too tight, just bend the thin strips out slightly so it’s easier to remove bits by hand."
