Neuropsychology,fcttbj3,t3_eivppd,1577958427.0,"Personally I think itâ€™s too... simplistic, shall we say, to say that any one part of the brain is responsible for any one behaviour. The brainâ€™s complex, and behaviour isnâ€™t purely biological. It might play a role, sure, but we canâ€™t rule out other factors like ongoing brain development in youngsters or being in a high school environment, for example. I donâ€™t think it would be a good idea to assume that all people who tend to mock others have brain malfunction. It might be a stretch, but imo, stating brain malfunction as the cause of reading or mocking behaviour in young adults or teenagers, for example, does, in a way, allow people to justify their behaviour and not intervene if someoneâ€™s feeling uncomfortable because â€œitâ€™s not their fault, their brainâ€™s just making them do thisâ€. Assigning blame to a biological defect instead of character flaws does have this problem, but again, as Iâ€™ve stated, itâ€™s definitely a reach, and I havenâ€™t really thought too much about the implications of something like this. 

Itâ€™s really interesting research, though, and I think itâ€™s worth investigating further."

internetparents,fcgc0wm,t3_eh710w,1577638450.0,"Iâ€™m just gonna preface this by saying that although I was diagnosed with PDDNOS (pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified) as a child, as far as Iâ€™m aware, Iâ€™ve managed to learn to cope with most of the symptoms very well, and I donâ€™t consider myself to be on the spectrum. However, there are still some (read: many) social situation related things that I struggle with, so all of the following advice is just taken what Iâ€™ve learned. Please take this all with a hefty grain of salt- Iâ€™m no expert. 



> I don't even know how to greet people. Should I hug people? Should we shake hands? 

Iâ€™d say that a good rule of thumb if youâ€™re unsure is to just smile and wave at first, and then ask if they want [insert thing here]. You could also probably tell by their body language, or their actions; if they wanna hug you, theyâ€™ll probably lean in, and if they wanna shake hands, theyâ€™ll probably extend their hand. Asking does no harm and itâ€™s a good way to avoid awkwardness! 



> I always thought it was weird my mom never taught me how to act in situations like that. But I think we are all supposed to learn this things naturally, observing people or something like that.

Yeah, I was never taught either. I learned literally all that I know about social situations from watching and imitating others, often with a *lot* of awkwardness involved because I was absolutely terrible in social situations. 



> I also do'nt know how to meet new people, mantain relationships or even talk with people online. 

Hooo boy. I struggled with this too. Iâ€™m absolutely shit at maintaining online friendships, too. However, I think that the best way to strike up a friendship is to just say hi! Most of the time, people are quite friendly. Subreddits like r/MakeNewFriendsHere and r/Needafriend are great if you wanna make new friends on Reddit! 



> Don't know when I should show interest.

A â€œtrickâ€ that I use when Iâ€™m meeting new people is to always ask them about themselves. Listen to what they say, too, and then ask questions based on that. If you struggle to keep the conversation going, then Iâ€™d suggest just smiling and nodding, then asking them to elaborate on something they mentioned. 



> Is messaging first a sign of weakness? What if they never  reach out first?

Messaging first is never a sign of weakness! I love seeing notifications in my inbox- it makes me happy that someone thought of me and wanted to talk to me! If someone never reaches out first, they might be busy- donâ€™t fret about it too much. I know that Iâ€™ve often ignored messages, or simply forgot to reply to them, because Iâ€™ve been really busy. 



> Omg I'm reading about body language and there are so many rules to memorize. i don't know what I'm doing. I would rather be myself. 

Trust me- nobody does either. Socialising is hard- I get it. Imo, itâ€™s better to learn how to socialise by watching and learning, then imitating what others do. Itâ€™s how I learned to be funny and social, and I still do it now. May I ask if youâ€™ve heard of something called â€œsocial scriptsâ€? My best friend is on the spectrum, and she talks about it a fair amount. As far as I know, it involves having planned responses of sorts that you can use in certain social situations- sort of like how you prepare answers to potential questions in interviews and exams, but for situations you might find yourself in during your daily life. 



> I think I have autism. I heard diagnosing adults is a pain in the ass. Don't know if knowing for sure I'm on the spectrum will help or not

I think itâ€™s worth a shot, personally. It is kind of hard to diagnose adults, yes, but thereâ€™s no harm in trying, right? And hey, if you do get diagnosed, it might be helpful for you, but Iâ€™m not you, so I wouldnâ€™t know.



I wish you the best, OP! <3"
