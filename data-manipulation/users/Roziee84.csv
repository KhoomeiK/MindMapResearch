unpopularopinion,fdf5cpi,t3_el0178,1578353675.0,"I totally agree, I don't drink much at its horrible. The hang over, the loss of control of behavior even the use of your legs at times. It's really unhealthy and like you say it's not even that enjoyable to taste or drink. I honestly don't understand how alcohol Is legal and weed is not. Weed never killed no one yet alcohol costs our health services so much money."
