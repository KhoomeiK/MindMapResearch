Against players that don't try play around a hero, Deathwing is definitely a monster. Against a hero that counters him well, easily shut down. Going against a good leoric or Tychus I do 1/2 the damage I usually pull off on him.

MrRobot,fdxoibn,t3_en27jo,1578771261.0,"Elliot created Mr Robot to suppress Elliot's memories of the abuse, and to maintain the protector image of a father. Darlene resented her mother because she didn't understand why Magda hated Edward. Mastermind used Darlene's ignorance and grief of losing essentially both her parents to take down E-Corp. Masterminds plan all along was to take down corruption and the day in day out evils Elliot lived around. With the Mastermind not being ready to face the entirety of Elliot's trauma, it was shoe horned in that it was about Edwards death. It was a tool to keep Mastermind oblivious that he was a personality, and to manipulate Darlene into following along. Although I think Darlene would have gone through it regardless of the reason because of her guilt for abandoning Elliot.

When I look back at it, it almost feels like coincidence that E-Corp and Whiterose were attached to Edward at all. It really came down to the Deus Group, Whiterose was a chink in their armor because of her obsession with her machine. Edward and Mr Robot were merely a distraction to shroud the fact that Mastermind had taken over Elliot for the entirety of the show."
MrRobot,fdxlzcj,t1_fdqjoc5,1578770434.0,"I definitely think that we never see Elliot once throughout the show, even in a flashback. The one time he is referenced by Mr Robot, about him talking to Darlene, we don't even know what they talked about. I think this is also why in the final shot of the show, it doesn't pan out past his eyes."
MrRobot,fdxlp0t,t3_emykwq,1578770254.0,"I'd have to agree with the rest in saying that there is no good way to go about a recap. Season 4 is a very fast moving season that is very detailed oriented. Losing the weight of scenes like Vera/Christa/Elliot in Christa's office, awful. The audio design of the entire episode of the Dox and Deus hack, beautiful.

I think you need to call her out. She enjoyed Season 1&2, lost interest through 3, and upon hearing the praise of season 4, wants to be a part of it without any investment. Remind her that the middle acts of most performances can be slow but it sets up the finale that ties up the entire show.

Also, you claim she can't be dissuaded, but you could always not watch it with her.... Don't be an accomplice to someone butchering a great show! It's only 4 seasons for crying out loud. You are not asking her to watch 90 episodes of Lost or something..."
MrRobot,fdxjp26,t1_fdvml5q,1578769417.0,"I can see your point but there is still some depth to how it is written in the show.

Given that he was abused, there was a part of him that was thankful that his father was gone. That most likely would have created a lot of guilt inside of Elliot, thus the mother personality was born. Elliot via this personality tormented himself with the guilt, as a lot of victims in these events end up blaming themselves to cope.

As life went on and Elliot continued to see abusers everywhere, controlling their victims through oppression, he created the Mastermind. A vigilante persona that could stand up for Elliots guilt, and take down oppression. The internal battle of control ensued because that Mastermind persona was unaware of the origins of all the personalities, including himself.

As to your question, we don't know if Magda was bad or not. We pretty much never see Magda, just the personality that Elliot created. We can assume that Darlene's resentment was because of how Madga handled the inner family drama. As the relationship between Magda and Edward deteriorated and she pulled away from being there for the kids, its likely both Elliot and Darlene resented her for it.

Elliot clearly suppressed the abuse, and created Mr Robot to continue seeing his father as a protector, which would have likely made him see his mother in a negative light, regardless of what the relationship really was like. I would need to rewatch the whole show and pick parts out to get a better image of how Darlene thought of Edward, I don't think that was touched on much. 

I wonder if Darlene knew that the Mr Robot personality was the image of their father. Perhaps some of the mannerisms were similar or speech patterns etc. She does acknowledge the personality, and that it grew on her towards the end. Just as she realized quickly that it was Mastermind pulling the strings, but kept it to herself because it was bringing them closer together, maybe the Mr Robot persona was giving her closure too..."

I see it as an overwhelming experience that they forget that their actual physical self relates to what they are seeing. Depending on the game, what you are doing with your body directly corresponds with whats happening in your field of view, but you need to have a self awareness that you are existing in two realms.

Witcher 3 for sure. Great combat, great story, great universe. The quests are all very unique and very grounded in the world. You will meet an interact with NPCs that will really leave you thinking afterwards."
