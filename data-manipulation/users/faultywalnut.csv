I worked in a small construction crew and everyone else was a Trump supporter, and they said some things that left me incredulous. They constantly advocated for violence against Clinton, liberals, and recently Iranians. I want Trump out of office and in prison but I’m scared of the reactions some of his supporters will have."

It smelled of strong perfume, cigarettes and hairspray."
