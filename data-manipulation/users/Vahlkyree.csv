The bride and groom also found out he was there and ***allowed*** him to come to the reception. He was asked to come which is the difference between what those girla did and what he did. Watching the wedding cost the bride and groom nothing as it was on a public beach.


ETA - this video is actually of the rehearsal and not the actual wedding. If anyone wants the rest of the story, search his name on tiktok or Google it. The bride and groom weren't upset at all."

MurderedByWords,fg8zk66,t1_fg0vy18,1580632204.0,"Ok but the people being affected by contaminated, poisonous water far out weighs the people dying from gun violence.

Going further, its not as tho innocent people are dying from gun violence either (not a large majority). Whereas there ARE innocent people (and ONLY innocent people) being negatively effected, whether death or severe illness, by dirty water. Flints majority of gun violence is gangs. The people doing the shooting can stop it themselves. The residents of Flint can't stop the water from killing them and/or making them sick themselves. Your comment made no sense if we are going off of the OPs original image, like you said.

ETA - Also, the original context has very little to do with dogs than it has to do with implying that white people don't care about Flint's water problem because a majority of Flint residents are poc. Otherwise, the person who tweeted wouldn't have made it a racial comment and would have just said ""people""."
MurderedByWords,ffz4iy2,t1_ffyuqzr,1580363713.0,"So because they have some gun violence we shouldn't worry about them having clean water to drink?

I'm confused as to why you thought this was an intelligent enough comment to hit ""send""...."
oddlysatisfying,ffz47hn,t1_ffyhpab,1580363409.0,I've always done that by picturing a circle in my mind and cutting it into 3rds or 4ths to see the difference.
aww,ffz43hg,t1_ffyj46l,1580363299.0,Its really making me want to curl up with them in it
wholesomememes,ffz3yqz,t1_ffz07f7,1580363172.0,Appears as tho you can't even follow your own advice.
wholesomememes,ffz3uep,t1_ffyot7g,1580363056.0,"You're doing great! The only thing I would suggest is to try not to compare your place in life to other people. Everyone has a different path and moves differently. Just because someone your age is doing something different, or better in your mind, doesn't mean that's where you should be!

On the flip side, if you realistically think it is, might I suggest setting several short term goals to reach your larger goal? It will help you see you are moving forward instead of thinking you aren't getting anywhere. Again, there is no exact ""pace"", tho. As long as you are moving forward, that's all that really matters"

Coronavirus,ffz39gw,t1_ffgx2md,1580362523.0,"Lol I don't know where you're getting your info but it appears as tho your beloved Chinese govt is drastically reducing the numbers of actual cases and deaths. Not to mention, I've heard nothing about them building hospitals during this time, unless you are referring to emergency centers temporarily opening to deal with the mass infected.

Also, its been known that China has been mass murdering Uighur and mass incarcerating them as well. Not to mention theor overall target on minorities. But sure, let's talk about them ""pulling people out of poverty"" when they've been known to also fudge those numbers as well. 

Not to mention they falsify numbers as far as their growth when there are literal towns being built that are ghost towns or have 1 of every 5 houses occupied. Meaning they are making it look like they are growing when, in fact, they are not, but quite the opposite."
