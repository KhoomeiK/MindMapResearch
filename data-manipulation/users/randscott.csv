todayilearned,ffewki4,t1_ffedhu8,1579868491.0,"We vacationed up there all the time as a kid. Love the Tahquamenon area especially. I wanted to buy a place and while looking at real estate photos my wife is like ""you know what I see in these photos? A blanket on every piece of furniture.""

That's fair."
mildlyinteresting,ffevxt1,t3_et2ew3,1579867806.0,Wasn't it dead before you shocked it?
Flipping,ffevt9d,t1_ffeksng,1579867665.0,"They will also give at least some credit for almost anything. I came across a bundle of crappy 360 games, bought them for $5, traded them in for $21 and walked out with Lego DC Villains.

I don't go there often, but am not affronted by their existence."
Flipping,ffevml6,t1_ffeauig,1579867452.0,"CBD?

Because that's all their signs advertise at the ones by me. Do they actually rent videos?"
Codependency,ffcn8t8,t3_eswgv9,1579803055.0,"Compassion.

I study Buddhist teachings, from a secular point of view. Compassion, both for myself, and others, is what I strive for. ""How to See Yourself As You Really Are"" is a great book to start, if you are interested. By the Dalai Lama, but it's not a religious text."
menwritingwomen,ff9kmqr,t3_esccup,1579715000.0,I can only imagine a virgin guy who read this and then tried to impress the first girl he was with.
books,ff8z12o,t3_es9103,1579700554.0,"I kind of liked the world building but thought that the story was meh. It feels like most sci-fi/fantasy these days is like games people play. All they want to do is be OP and win all the time.

But I'm old lol. I recommend trying Swords and Deviltry if you haven't. Or Elric of Melnibone."
todayilearned,ff8x27y,t1_ff8ux4t,1579698897.0,"It's like any other workplace. A percentage that would do anything they can get away with. The rest just trying to do a decent job and go home. Most of those will keep their head down when stuff goes sideways.

Which is the same everywhere, and why rat bastards are almost always in charge everywhere of everything."
todayilearned,ff8t7kw,t1_ff8sc0o,1579695187.0,I have a friend in Texas that hunts for arrowheads and stuff as a hobby. He finds something every outing. There are thousands of years of discarded human stuff lying around.
politics,ff8t1fw,t1_ff8j8nr,1579694997.0,"It's pretty prevalent in Michigan. A lot of it is by people who would say (and probably believe) they aren't racist, but actually are.

My FiL for a typical instance (loves to tell you) chairs the diversity committee at his church. But as an example he told my wife, who has an autoimmune disease, that he wanted her to quit her job or never go outside at the commercial greenhouse she manages, because the migrant workers carry diseases."
duck,ff7kas3,t3_es0ywm,1579651562.0,One that does what it should?
science,ff7jv02,t1_ff7hnmx,1579651260.0,"This is not true. There was no general consensus on cooling in the 70s. It's another discredited specious attack, because facts are too difficult to contend with."
worldpolitics,ff7it6o,t1_ff6ea20,1579650546.0,You can't give people an annual lump sum. It has to be monthly or preferably every other week. No poor person is going to make a lump sum last 12 months.
dermatomyositis,ff7hus1,t3_eruxd8,1579649905.0,"As others said, see a doc. If you have muscle pain, in an arm hopefully, that's a good place for biopsy. Well not hopefully but better than taking a chunk of calf muscle.

It's hard to confirm DM positively without muscle damage."
todayilearned,ff7hbge,t1_ff7eo2v,1579649548.0,Dude. Juries are the cornerstone of our legal system. Your lucky if it's a group of randos rather than 1 person who is part of the broken system. Yeah they screw up but better than just having one guy working for the city or state or fed deciding your fate.
ponds,ff7g2xz,t3_ery47o,1579648737.0,"Aerator would be best, try and keep a hole open so gases can escape. Deicer is ok usually cheaper. To open closed ice, boil water in a pan then set the pan on top of ice to melt through. 

Don't put the Deicer on top of ice, if that is a route you go, melt down to water first.

As others said, don't feed him until water temp is about 55."
UpliftingNews,ff7dvhl,t1_ff70znd,1579647283.0,"Maybe. I've been there. Only a few weeks but my family and I went without a tour group. Stayed in neighborhood places, including one small village where everyone gathered at a river swollen by rain and scooped fish out, cooked them for us in banana leaves. There is a lot of good too. Women retire at 50 and men at 60. The parks are many and full, heck even the Temple of Heaven is a huge, free, public park. I'm not saying my anecdotal vacation means anything. I just liked the people I met and things I saw. We had great conversations even if it was sometimes through Google translate. I get so tired of the constant hate I hear."
