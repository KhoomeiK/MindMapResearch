I've done an e-learning study, and studied whenever I could, so there was time to crash if needed. I didn't need as much crash time as I planned for, so I was done with time to spare.

Edit: Typical for this sub that the suggestion of being nice gets downvoted. Shame really, because if both partied had actually tried to be nice, this situation wouldn't have happened. As with so many AITA's. Let's look at this one:

>""that's nice but I wouldn't sleep with someone who has something like that on their add."" 

Not a very nice thing to say. If she'd had said something like that it's not to her personal taste, or just had not given her opinion, OP wouldn't have been insulted.

>She got all upset because I essentially called her not worth dating.

So OP knows that she hurt her friend. Not very nice either.

Yes, they are literally trained to put their best don't forward. Their goal is being good human beings. I was raised as a JW from birth. I was taught to put my best foot forward. Because it's the right thing to do. If my mother had any ulterior motives, she didn't teach me those :-) 

The divorce I mentioned, happened over 20 years ago, so honestly, I'm pretty fuzzy on the details. Iirc, she had psychological issues, that she dealt with by leaving her husband and children without any explanation. When she wanted to come back, her husband didn't trust her anymore. After about a year of continous fighting, they wanted a divorce. This was not a good enough reason, so they got excluded (I'm sorry, I don't know the official term in English). She left again, leaving her kids with him. He had his own small company, his family were mostly JW's as well, and almost all of his friends too. So he didn't have many people left, and felt let down. Lots of the congregation understood, so elderlings kept visiting for some time (this was none of my business, so I don't know how long). Both my sisters kept in touch with him for months, but over time, contact slowly dried up. I was 16, about a decade younger, so I wasn't exactly in the loop, and I felt awkward about contacting him (what would I have said?). One of the elderling's wife was a close friend to my mom, and I heard them talk (gossip, probably) about them for months. In short: The woman left, the man was officially kicked out, but got taken care of. I can't prove any of this, it's always gonna be some stranger on the internet typing something... :-/ 

Yep, this whole comment thread is about an opinion. I just wanted to add mine, in the hopes of tipping the balance ever so slightly, so that people every now and again hear a positive story too. That's all I was trying to do.

>What does my pointing out that they have a problem with child abuse have to do with other religions? When did I mention other religions?

Again, my apologies. I assumed (never assume!) that because you mentioned this topic in this thread, you were going to use this as proof of bad people. 

I'm not saying that Jehovah's Witnesses are perfect. Far from. But they are not *all* bad. Source: was raised as one. Others may have been raised by total asshole Jehovah's Witnesses. That proves that JW's are not *all good.

My point during this whole conversation, was always just to say that there are also good people that are JW's. I hope people that read this may keep that in the backs of their mind when they meet JW's :-)"
AskReddit,ff9bcae,t1_ff99qmd,1579709079.0,">They can just go live their lives, and the JWs will generally remain nice and cordial to them, because they hope you'll change your mind one day, so they keep trying to give a good witness to you.

This makes it sound like they're all 'in on it' and are continuously and actively faking it :-) I can promise you that's not the case. Although, there's probably a nutcase like that in every congregation. For the most part, they just try to be good human beings, being generally nice and cordial to *everybody*.

>However if you are baptized, and decide you no longer believe, or get punished with disfellowshipping for breaking one of the many, many, many rules, such as sex before marriage, that's when the hateful shunning kicks in.

The couple I mentioned were both baptised.

>However on the whole, I'd argue that in fact, it's neither the negative stories nor the positive ones about JWs that get published. Mostly, they simply don't get talked about at all. 

Tbh, whenever I see something about JW's, it's usually very hateful stuff. It's like people just don't want to know that there are mostly kind people in those congregations, trying to live a meaningful life. 

>Have you heard of the Australian Royal Commission regarding Child Abuse?

No, but I've heard there are investigations into child abuse in my country as well. I think that's a good thing. As I mentioned before, there are bad people everywhere, and a religion should be a safe place. So yes, let's actively search for people who do bad stuff, and punish them. But let's not pretend there aren't bad people in other religions too. The pot and the kettle... :-)"

AskReddit,ff95hpg,t1_ff945jd,1579705313.0,"They didn't go against it, they implemented it in a friendly way, rather than a harsh one.

I left when I was 19, because I just don't belief. They didn't like it, especially my mom took it hard. But since I wasn't baptised, the rules of completely cutting me off didn't apply to me. They nodded to me in the supermarkets, but no small talk.

A couple I had been close with, got divorced without 'acceptable' cause. The woman moved away, the guy stayed in town, but was pretty bitter. He took care of their kids, and I know a few people from the congregation would check in with them in the first few weeks, to see if he was holding it together and if they needed anything. 

I can understand that they want to steer clear of people that have chosen to change their ways, we all choose to be with people with similar interests and habits, right? But yeah, some of the stories you hear are pretty harsh. Because of my personal experience, I realise that the good stories aren't interesting enough to make it to the newspapers and Internet.
