fatlogic,ffa0al3,t1_ff7eoqc,1579725289.0,Yes I mean I'd be delighted if a patient asked me to send them studies instead of just ignoring my advice and assuming I haven't done my research. Heck I'd even work overtime to go through the studies with them.
fatlogic,ff9zs1s,t1_ff7q59x,1579724986.0,"And the thing is, a thin person with type 2 diabetes would definitely aggravate their situation if they became obese and be recommended to maintain a healthy weight"
fatlogic,ff9zct4,t3_es2fu7,1579724740.0,"""Do thin patients get this health problem? What do you recommend for them?""

One of the answers to this is ""I'd recommend they avoid other risk factors that can worsen the condition, such as obesity"""
fatlogic,ff9yy88,t1_ff9r8ff,1579724503.0,"A lot of things aren't essential for our vital functions to work, but can still improve health. E.g carbohydrates facilitate some types of exercise like running. They are an invaluable resource for the body when physically active, even if you don't need them to stay alive. I think we need to agree that what's ""necessary"" for the body more or less depends on the person's goals for function. A person who wants to be able to take a walk after dinner every day are going to have different functioning goals than someone wanting to run a marathon, and the necessary diet differs between these two."
fatlogic,feqlq6a,t1_fehisax,1579343347.0,"Exactly. I have an underweight bmi, I'm weak as fuck and have poor body coordination. I can only do exercise regiments for beginners that also take the time to go through each basic movement properly"
fatlogic,fembbsr,t1_fem6le5,1579247047.0,"Yep.

Eating a lot of junk food is also a kind of diet. An unhealthy one."
UpliftingNews,fel69e1,t1_fel5dwn,1579214956.0,"I think a big part is that HIV in general is very rare in Sweden. In 2018 there were 481 cases and only 76 patients were actually infected IN Sweden (and of those 76, homosexual men are the majority). Free health care and good sexual health education are probably contributing factors."
UpliftingNews,fel5k86,t1_fel46an,1579214529.0,"There is PEP that you can take after exposure to avoid catching the disease. The PEP medication is usually the same as PrEP, only plus an additional drug"
UpliftingNews,fel2as8,t1_feknsy5,1579212517.0,"What's funny is that in my country (sweden, which has a large out homosexual population) the main course of transmission is from heterosexual sex (usually transmitted outside the country - immigrants from countries with a lot of HIV or swedish men going to Thailand to party). Gay men are still unable to donate blood."
UpliftingNews,fel0vtu,t1_fekyqhw,1579211661.0,"Actually studies have shown that if you're on HIV medication and go to your routine check ups the risk of transmission is effectively zero even without condoms. See my above post where I reference the study. (76 000+ condomless anal sexacts between an infected and an uninfected partner with zero cases of transmission. It's really amazing how far we've come)

Edited to add: you should still use condoms though lol, not just for the sake of the HIV- person's sake but for the HIV+ one too. There are several STIs out there"
medicine,fekxudw,t1_fejdqkh,1579209844.0,If the patient was in a coma I assume they got cleaned by the nurse daily? How did no one notice this then?
UpliftingNews,fekwdvv,t1_fekvery,1579208978.0,"Ugh it really grinds my gear when people talk about shit they don't know anything about, especially when it comes to a stigmatized group such as people with HIV. I've worked with some HIV patients and the psychological issues due to the stigma is by far the worst part of the disease for them."
UpliftingNews,fekvg70,t1_fektm5l,1579208422.0,"OP is talking about ART and not prep.

ART = treatment for hiv patients which suppresses the virus and makes you unable to transmit it

Prep = preventative treatment for people who dont have HIV"
UpliftingNews,fekv5sh,t1_fektf4t,1579208251.0,"And even when missing doses, it's not like missing 1 day will suddenly spike your viral load. HIV is a slow virus. It takes missing several, especially in combination with skipping your routine checkups (which can see if your viral loads start increasing - can also happen if the virus mutates to resist the treatment in which case you need to switch)"
UpliftingNews,feksy9z,t1_fekrrgz,1579206952.0,"Please link a source to this because I have yet to hear a case.

There was a really big study conducted over several years where over 1000 couples with only one partner HIV+ (on treatment) had sex without condoms. Result? Zero transmission. Over 76 000 instances of anal sex yet you say it's only effective in 99%?

wow,feje4zu,t1_fejcv4v,1579169641.0,Maybe darnassus was named after the language. I don't think there's a translation for what darnassian means but maybe it translates to something important to night elves.
fatlogic,fe78qnu,t1_fe5gvpi,1578911534.0,"You may not have significant breathing issues, but it could potentially be a problem if you undergo general anesthesia because an obstruction (which is the cause of snoring) can make intubation difficult and dangerous."
classicwow,fdqauq7,t1_fdpvk67,1578661505.0,"Yeah mained prot warr in WotLK, had no desire to play anything else loved it so much. Not been able to get into it in classic though."
news,fdnqmxd,t1_fdn7049,1578590968.0,Yeah that's the reason I use it. I'm in many groups with friends and stuff and I also use it to find fun events in my area or to have an easy tool to plan parties etc. It has great usage if you have an active social life.
fatlogic,fdmuf0l,t3_em4tj8,1578566287.0,Untreated diabetes generally cause weight loss not weight gain.
nosleep,fdmquf2,t1_fdkvkeb,1578561270.0,"They could have, but it's very unlikely that someone just falls into a coma like that. Generally you'll start by getting sicker. If someone who was fine one day then suddenly is comatose the morning after, it definitely would get attention from the medical community. If it happens to other people as well? Well then something weird is going on."
nosleep,fdkizlg,t1_fdk1jjx,1578504744.0,"Old and sick people yes. A bunch of young healthy people falling into comas? Someone would notice, that's not common. Especially not if it was people from the same country."
fatlogic,fdgglwf,t1_fdfx9hl,1578395886.0,"This is very true. Also just wanted to add an additional reason, that when you're 14 bmi or something it's difficult to maintain on 1200 because lower weight also lowers your tdee even despite of other factors."
fatlogic,fdgg9fk,t1_fdfnkf7,1578395437.0,"Yep, it's a mental disease with physical symptoms not vice versa. You can lose weight in an unhealthy way without it being anorexia."
fatlogic,fdgg6x2,t1_fdf83bi,1578395345.0,"Anorexia is used as a buzzword to deter people from dieting. They clearly don't understand the true severeness of the disease if they think that some dieting is even close. Even if it's an unhealthy diet, it doesn't mean it's anorexia. It just means it's an unhealthy diet."
worldnews,fd1pt7s,t1_fd1jjmj,1578134914.0,"Yeah the value should be dependent on the needs of the recipient not your own wealth.

Eg my friend went through a rough time economically and had problems paying rent, I make decent money soooo I bought him a bunch of groceries to help him at least put food on the table for the coming week. If he had told me that I needed to give him more because I afford it or I shouldn't help him at all, I'd be pissed lmao"
classicwow,fcz0xld,t1_fcyzw5n,1578091460.0,"I assume that was his question... If the warlock were summoning people outside the instance, he needed to be outside too, so he couldn't summon someone inside the instance."
relationships,fcmx1sn,t3_ei2dco,1577796087.0,"I'd say not to worry. IF you're curious and want to have sex, go ahead and do it! But you don't need to do it for a future relationship. Just do what feels right."
relationships,fcmwti9,t3_ei1wyb,1577795816.0,Don't overthink what he's saying. Focus on you and moving on. Probably the best thing is to not talk to him more.
relationships,fcmvm8i,t1_fcm3swg,1577794347.0,"Tbh I highly doubt the thyroid disease is the entire problem, it sounds a bit like an excuse. Now I don't know if she has an unusual type of problem or a very severe case, but IN GENERAL most thyroid problems are very common (especially in women her age) and relatively easy to manage. It sounds like there has been problems in the relationship for a very long time though so I wouldn't think the thyroid is the source of her problems in the first hand, maybe just exacerbating behavior that was already present, but then again as I said we don't know enough of her thyroid problem to know the severity."
aww,fci22ej,t1_fchy6ct,1577656811.0,"It is a bit strange but can also be pretty luxurious. You can have a lot of room and free space, can cook your own food, get good location without it being too expensive, etc.

However I always save a little extra cash just in case the place seems sketchy and I want to gtfo to a hotel. But I've never had to."
fatlogic,fc1ixk9,t1_fbug34h,1577320138.0,"I mean it *is* a hassle, I wouldn't put anyone down for not wanting to incorporate it into their daily life. I'd just recommend doing it for a few weeks/months and then you'll know the average of your usual meals. If you make a new dish make sure to weigh, and if you stop losing weight go back to weighing for a while. But you definitely don't need to weigh food for the rest of your life..."
