YAlit,ffb9x00,t1_ffb8v68,1579756683.0,"Ah, that explains a lot. I also think ACOTAR is far better. ToG reads very young, and it’s run into some of my least favorite things–female bashing (what on earth is this characterization of Lady Kaltain????? Making other women caricatures just to give your character the illusion of depth and class is NOT A THING THAT SHOULD EXIST). And I’m getting a whiff of instalove, so I might have to call it. I don’t think this series is for me.

Thank you!"

Your entire comment was so well said. It still amazes me to remember how he could look me in the eye and completely point blank lie while feeling genuine hurt and betrayal that I might even think he could be lying."
YAlit,ffb1cvl,t1_ffb0ocg,1579749357.0,"Ah okay, thanks! I avoided reading ToG for forever after reading some pretty terrible sounding reviews, but have also heard a lot of raves about it so finally started into it this week. I can see why it’s popular but I’m also finding it pretty problematic/immature so far. No idea if it’s gonna improve or what, and your comment does not inspire hope."
YAlit,ffb0mv1,t1_ffamwh2,1579748867.0,Can you clarify what book or series you’re talking about?
LOTR_on_Prime,ff8o9gc,t1_ff8mxfn,1579688593.0,"I think this article you posted is referencing very outdated info. It’s true that Christopher Tolkien refused to sell the rights to the Silmarillion when he was head of the Tolkien estate, god bless him. However, Christopher stepped down as the head of the Tolkien estate in 2017. Amazon acquired the rights to this show directly from the Tolkien estate after Christopher Tolkien stepped down (I remember when this happened, because it felt like a betrayal of Christopher Tolkien’s wishes). The Tolkien estate sold the rights for this adaptation for quite a lot of money, for better or worse. So amazon doesn’t have the same restrictions to the Silmarillion that Peter Jackson did. 

Quick google search: 
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.inverse.com/amp/article/38493-lord-of-the-rings-tolkien-rights-estate-christopher-amazon-show

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/live-feed/how-lord-rings-tv-series-landed-at-amazon-not-netflix-1099213

So I think it’s unlikely that the main characters will be OCs. Amazon has the (very expensive) rights to the main characters in the second age, so why would they make a show about OCs? There’s tons of speculation about who the characters are going to be but I haven’t heard anyone claiming they’re OCs. But I guess we shall see!"
LOTR_on_Prime,ff8m6gm,t1_ff8lqij,1579685390.0,"Hm, do you have a source? My last understanding was that the Tolkien estate gave full permission for this show to explore the full second age of Middle Earth, as told by the Silmarillion. Details are still fuzzy, so I don’t know anything definite, but that seems to be much of the consensus online. No first age (my favorite) and no third age (which is where most of our knowledge of Thranduil comes from). Here is one article talking about it:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/09/amazons-new-lord-of-the-rings-cannot-use-much-of-tolkiens-plot

But if you have a source, please share! I’m still piecing my knowledge of the show together."
LOTR_on_Prime,ff8ksgx,t1_ff8jn8l,1579683263.0,"I don’t think the shows cast is going to be primarily OCs. I think (and definitely hope!) it will feature characters from the Silmarillion, of which there are many. If I’m not mistaken, so far they have only released the character audition names. Audition names are false character ‘names’ or aliases assigned for auditions and casting in the early stages of production, in order not to reveal the plot and characters. Eventually these names are dropped and replaced with the actual character names when the production is ready to reveal details of the characters and plot. That’s why there is a lot of speculation on this sub of who the characters really are based on the casting descriptions.

I am sure they’ll make up supporting characters and details as well, but these characters are hopefully not the MCs around whom the plot  revolves. The Silmarillion has a ton of content and the world in the second age was being heavily shaped by many main players, so it makes sense that they’ll be showing some of those storylines. 

Out of curiosity, have you read the Silmarillion? (Eta: sounds like it from your post). There are a lot of great elven characters that have more robust storylines that could make good adaptations! The Feanorians, Fingon, and Finrod would be some of my top choices. But there’s also Beren and Luthiun, Turin’s story (human, but closely tied to Beleg, Gwindor, and many other main elves), Celebrimbor, Elrond and Elros, etc. Thranduil is interesting, but one of the least fleshed out characters outside of his portrayal in the hobbit, which has already been adapted. Not knocking him though-I always had a soft spot for Thranduil in the hobbit book."
BPDlovedones,ff8go6g,t3_es54x9,1579677653.0,"I think 50% is projection and a good 50% is plain ol’ gaslighting and manipulation. 

Projection is an unconscious defense mechanism. BPD is marked by having a highly unstable sense of self. Perceived criticism and self-reflection are both really threatening when you don’t have a stable sense of self or identity to fall back on. You need some stability in your identity in order to be able to self-reflect and incorporate criticism without falling apart. This is called ego-strength. People with BPD respond so negatively when they perceive any kind of criticism because without the ego strength to handle it, it feels like a rejection and attack on their entire being. So rather than look inward, the problem *needs* to be outside of them in order to stave off that collapse. Hence unconsciously projecting whatever criticism they receive onto others. Furthermore, the poor sense of self means they have a hard time differentiating themselves from others, which is why they often think that other people are doing the things they’re doing or have done in the past (e.g. cheating, lying, etc).

Gaslighting/manipulation on the other hand is a conscious defense mechanism, but that’s a whole different story.

Edited for words."
LOTR_on_Prime,ff89ojt,t3_eq11ys,1579670142.0,"Any series focused on Thranduil wouldn’t be a genuine Tolkien story, so much as a fanfic-like addition. Tolkien just didn’t focus on Thranduil enough to provide sufficient material for his own series. Even the hobbit movies just made stuff up to fill the gaps, and I found the “embellishments” to be really jarring with the canon material. None of the Tauriel plotline or backstory added in those movies is canon in Tolkien’s world. Of course there will be embellishment to any screen adaptation, but that’s different from creating an entire series about events that didn’t happen in canon. Tolkien wrote so much material for Middle Earth. It would seem disrespectful to me for writers to use his world and creations to just tell their own stories, which is what a spinoff like this would be. Imo, either adapt the existing material, or create a different fantasy world altogether.

Edit: Though I can see Thranduil featuring in a series about the second age, including some of the (canon) material you mention in your post! I just don’t think there’s enough material for him to have his own series. It would make more sense if he was one character in the larger story taking place.

LOTR_on_Prime,fep7g2r,t3_epztuk,1579313834.0,"I hope not. Tolkien didn’t write Celebrimbor to be evil. He rejected his grandfather’s oath and his father’s wicked actions. Celebrimbor’s story is a tragedy because he was truly trying to do good, and was tricked by Sauron. If I recall correctly, when he discovered Sauron’s deception he concealed the locations of the 3 rings and died nobly. My greatest hope for the Amazon series is that they stick to the source material without over sensationalizing it or changing characterizations to stir up dramatic tension. I could see them painting Celebrimbor as the big bad because it’s Hollywood, but I would hate it and don’t think it would be true to the source material."

Currently reading Reverie by Ryan La Sala and enjoying it immensely. The writing is great, the plot is good and the protagonist is hilarious and immensely likable. Haven’t encountered any romance in it yet (21% in) but the hero is gay. I’m thinking romance will probably turn up at some point.
