DunderMifflin,ffitbl4,t1_ffirjg0,1579982198.0,"The UK office was not easy viewing like the US one was. Probably to do with a few things including that UK shows need longevity since they're often 24 episodes per many seasons. UK TV shows rarely go beyond 3 seasons. See Black Books, It Crowd, Father Ted, Spaced etc.

The UK version was just different."

DunderMifflin,ffhuqp4,t1_ffh4uh7,1579954832.0,"They're not comparable. I love the US Office but it was a lot more slapstick style comedy than the UK office (also fantastic) .

Its the same kind of story but told very differently. The US one is totally bombastic, brightly coloured and ridiculous compared to dreary, awkward UK one.

It's funny the US version is pretty much what you'd expect the US to take and do with a drab UK product. The US has an impression in the UK of everything being ""bigger, more exaggerated"" in the US. That's the space the US one occupies for me. I don't think the shows can be fairly compared."
