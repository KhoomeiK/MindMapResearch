I use the alpha arbutin and find it absorbs very quickly and I can move on almost immediately whereas the niacinamide needs a few minutes or else anything after it will pill. I would recommend just diving in and see what works for you, give yourself lots of time if you can especially at first. The worst that will happen if you rush it is you'll get some piling.
