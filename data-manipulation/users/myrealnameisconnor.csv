nba,ffro4e8,t1_ffrcdia,1580162089.0,"Honestly I rolled my eyes a bit at kids that wore 23, but maybe it's because i grew up playing hockey as well where literally no one wore 99 because that was Gretzky's number. In the nhl it was retired for the same reason, not that wearing it would necessarily say that you think you are them, but that's kinda what they dont even want to give the oportunity to do. There was a one and only. 

Personally I think 24 and 8 should be retired (as well as 23 for that matter but that time has come and gone). I understand the mentality that people are wearing them in honour of and because they looked up to them, but because of how I grew up I see no one wearing that number as an even bigger sign of respect and admiration."

It will be infinitely easier and more possible to change driving laws and education to reduce fatalities, similar to other countries with competent drivers. North America has crazy crash statistics because their drivers fucking suck. The current self driving tech is so fucking far away still it literally makes no sense to bank on it even being a thing let alone restructuring all the laws in place and completely ripping apart the current insurance industry and how we see buying cars. Tesla's current autopilot is basically just adaptive cruise control with a steering wheel you have to babysit. It's honestly easier and less sketchy to just drive the damn thing yourself. The issue isnt people being shitty at driving, its letting people that are distracted or shitty at driving drive.
