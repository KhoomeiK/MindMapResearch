crochet,ffi6nma,t3_ets4tw,1579966495.0,The last one I made I used 4 weight and chose a chunky alpine stitch. It took me ~3 weeks working on it everyday
ragdolls,ffi6hhx,t1_ffhqbdb,1579966372.0,Ha! My kitty likes the round part. When she curls up as tightly as possible she fits perfectly in it
relationship_advice,ffi6cr5,t1_fffrody,1579966274.0,Well he sounds very focused on career and adventure. There is no easy answer here. You may just have to sit down with him and figure out what you both truly want out of life.
relationship_advice,fffqqyz,t3_etckuc,1579889756.0,"It sounds like she is very insecure and has low self esteem. I have met women like that before that base their self worth on the attention they get from men. Unless she seeks therapy and learns to love herself, you can expect a lot of drama"
relationship_advice,fffqdqo,t3_etckv7,1579889528.0,"You mentioned you want a family, is this a shared goal? If he wants to move to Africa in 10 years you'll be pushing 40 and I'm guessing have small children if that's your plan. If that's the case, there's a good chance he'll change his mind. It's one thing to move a spouse, but moving small kids to a different continent is no easy task"

ragdolls,ffbckx4,t1_ff9by9t,1579759708.0,She is partial only to this or bathroom fixtures. She scratches at the shower door for me to open it so she can sleep inside. If the shower is unavailable she will also sleep in the tub or the sink
ragdolls,ff88vyb,t3_erfwsd,1579669421.0,"Mine would get sticky poos when she was young. She was on a very high protein, high fat food so I switched her to one that was a little less protein and fat and she stopped getting turds stuck to her."
ragdolls,ff87qa6,t3_erwy4s,1579668401.0,"Ah yes, he has entered ""the floofening"" phase"
AmItheAsshole,ff877cz,t3_es6n5l,1579667956.0,NTA he needs to learn the difference between flirting and harassment
crochet,ff4gk7q,t3_erlruf,1579563088.0,Something like a linen stitch would be dense
relationship_advice,ff32tq3,t3_ere5g4,1579532219.0,"Honestly, a lot of this is just due to having two teenage girls under the same roof. My sister and I constantly fought in our teen years. We never fully got along until we moved out. Now that we're adults living apart, we are friends"
dogs,feymxqe,t3_eqxagq,1579447745.0,Switching wet food is usually fine if its just a supplement and their main dry kibble is the same. It probably just preference. My dog wouldn't eat certain brands or flavours
aww,feykmr7,t3_eqxc5c,1579446843.0,Good bean.
KneadyCats,feuxhvq,t3_eqnv3k,1579390954.0,My kitty nurses on fuzzy blankets too!
IWantOut,ferz3zc,t1_ferkqqu,1579359851.0,"I get what you're saying, but it's not impossible. I've worked in my field for 6 years, I just need a degree to advance which is why I went back to school. I've also done 2 years of research and have publications so I wouldn't say I'm unskilled."
