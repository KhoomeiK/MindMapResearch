PoliticalHumor,fgfu1fg,t3_ey7djv,1580747599.0,Becuase fox news made it ok and defended it. They have massive reach and are the genuine only source of information millions of americans over the whole country have. By choice or by means of access they choose fox over all. It isn't helped by fox doubling down on the fake news trend and claiming that they tell the truth and that you wont see the info they have anywhere else.

People come from all over the world and speak dozens of languages theres no reason for anyone to demand they speak English and only english becuas they're in the us. My point was as Americans when you go abroad you know you're the non native so it's in your best interest to have some means of speaking the local language where ever you go. The same should be said here in the us, theres no reason to be upset or get mad at someone not speaking english its just ignorant and stupid but people still do and so you get shit like the tweet above.

The same should be seen here in the us, they dont have to speak english but as long as they make the effort to learn it it is appreciated.

 I will work with and help anyone that's struggling to speak a  language not native to them theres no reason not to. 

However if you are in a foreign country it's in your best interest to have a plan if you cant speak any at all. Do I expect it right when you get here no it takes time but it is something that should be done for your own self help.

My parents constantly told me I cant be in love, I dont know her enough, damn near impossible to go see her or her come visit. She moved a town over at one point and we were writing love letter back and forth but they'd read it and make me change a bunch of stuff. That lead me to the ""I know what I want mentality"" and the last serious relationship ended with me almost losing my family. Dated a girl they didnt like after meeting her one time so I just said fuck them they dont know. Months go by pregnant, abortion, one month later she's pregnant again and confessed to cheating on my multiple times throughout our relationship. Dont do this to your kid, be the best examples of a partner to them and tell them the good things in people to look for.

Where I lived my history classes and western civ classes focused on ww1 but more ww2 ,the holocaust, colonialism and the foundation of america, we learn briefly about slavery and the wars that were fought we kind of start to just get snippets of other things besides that but atrocities.

apexlegends,ffvnj5w,t1_ffvkndn,1580268323.0,"It's a team game becuase that's the only option solo queuing never works becuase you aren't agaisnt solos. It's not like fortnite where you can use building to make up for being out numbered. If your solo queing you're only able to take down a squad if you're just fucking damn good at the game or they are trash but any half aware team will erase a solo. The thing that I guess has me more on my soapbox is that it just doesn't require anything to have a dedicated solos and duos. It's not s custom mode with unique rules or properties, it would still be 65 players just solos and I guess the case with duos would require 66 players or 64. I love the game dont get me wrong but part of what kept me playing fortnite was the variety and unique modes always available. Apex has one mode, technically 2 with ranked but and we barely get one consistent extra mode. The games been out long enough that we should have either solo/duo/squad or atleast 1  constant unique mode.
