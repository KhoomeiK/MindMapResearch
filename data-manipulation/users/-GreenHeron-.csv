If you are truly serious about doing it, you need to reassure them that they won't lose you and that you love them and will stay in contact with them. Talk to them about what you hope to accomplish.

People never remain the same. We constantly change from one version of ourselves to another. Those who try to hold onto a past version of themselves end up suffering as the world changes around them.

I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder some years back and I used to get panic attacks. I used to think about all the things I'd done ""wrong"" in my life and how my future was going to suck, etc. But the only thing you really have control over is today. THIS is reality. Many people look for peace outside themselves, but peace comes from within and realizing that you have control over your own suffering. 

""One is one's own refuge, who else could be the refuge?"" ~Buddha

I would suggest looking up some Buddhist wisdom about fear, anxiety, and how to live in the present without worry. There's a lot of information and readings out there. Starting a meditation practice would also be useful. It's only after you tame your inner self that you'll be able to move ahead in life without worry. And as a personal aside, there is no ""right"" way to live. I used to think I was a failure because I didn't do what I always thought I was going to do....my life is very different from what I envisioned when I was younger. But my life is nice and I'm happy, and that's what is important.
