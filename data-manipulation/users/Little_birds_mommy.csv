Someone once tried to similarly shame me and I laughed in their face, ""Hey mother earth, was I supposed to starve my child for your sensibilities? Medical science shows that in five years, babies fed by breast and babies fed by bottle have no discernible differences. But they're both *alive.* A smug asshole attitude is a shame forever though. Best work on that.""


Highly recommended. I got real tired of other random people's opinions on how I should raise my baby pretty quick."

breakingmom,fev663c,t1_fev3l80,1579393506.0,"The 6 year old is finally napping on the couch and thank god for smartphones and Project Runway. We will take her for zofran tomorrow if it is still this bad. I may try and sneak some cereal later in the kitchen. The worst is that she's hungry but can't keep it down, liquid or solid. :( we are stocked with popsicles."
breakingmom,fet1r4s,t3_eqfgzl,1579371002.0,"You lost me on the 3 am call. I would have moved or insisted they moved immediately. That was so inappropriate it's beyond reason, in a damn Children's hospital... omg. Once that video went on, I would have gotten very vocal. You ate a saint with that patience."
offmychest,fe5l8hd,t1_fe2rt44,1578870900.0,"Follow up: years of experience echo here: TRUST YOUR FEELINGS. That man will undoubtedly try and save himself by calling you crazy and may even swear at you. This is his attempt to look innocent. Be in front of people and do not doubt yourself. Almost ALL women are harassed many times throughout their lifetime, sadly. And most people try to victim blame , victim shame, or pretend the victim is crazy imagining things. I do not know how to resolve the misogyny, only that you and my own child must somehow protect yourself and try to make it better for the next human."
offmychest,fe2ro46,t3_enknog,1578842117.0,"While I want to encourage you now to pick up the skills to go towards the register and then loudly and publicly draw attention to him (asking for help from staff to walk to your car if you need to), I'm a grizzley old 40 year old woman and mom. Next time this happens to you and it will, and you can't find a way to speak up for yourself, PLEASE find me and my likewise grizzled 35+ year olds or moms to help. You will find most of us understand, are happy to help, and will step in gladly to shame and run off assholes like this man. You have a right to feel safe. You have a right to be yourself and out in public. You DO NOT owe men anything including your time. It's a sad state of affairs that we live in a world where even the current administration publicly advocates sexual assault. Stay strong."

The healthcare floodgates are about to open up on the senior and elderly, who generally are the largest demographic supporting the Republican Party."

offmychest,fd55h9h,t1_fd4mn37,1578174363.0,Ooooh so edgy. So not able to read... good for you Pooppy troll. Rawr.
offmychest,fd3fzc8,t1_fd3cgn6,1578157944.0,"Oh hey Poppy troll, there you are. In posting and trying to prove how satirical and clever you are, you just go to prove how fucking uncool you are. Thanks for letting us all know."
offmychest,fd3739k,t1_fd34th0,1578155312.0,"You are awesome and you can do it. Some days are better than others. As time goes on, you thankfully begin to forget about it, but it never ever goes away, never. That's what horribly sucks about smoking... and anyone smoking near you can trigger the craving. It doesn't always, but it can, and you need to be aware of it. This morning I am trying to battle a very long, very difficult nickfit and it plays with you and your emotions. It's an unnecessary cruelty to play on others, and I get that it's totally unintentional, but it is torture from someone simply being flippant."

Then have a massive glass of wine and toast either their xmas tradition of being inconsiderate, or teetering on the outskirts of dementia and move on. Then take the tax deduction for the donation."
