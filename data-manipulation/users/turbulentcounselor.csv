I'm in college and can't make any of her times because I have class, work, or other mandatory extracurriculars to go to. Of course my schedule changes with the quarters, but how busy I am will likely be the same or even busier than now."

He really made an effort to make sure students were comfortable asking questions. Jenwould frequently ask if there were questions after going over concepts. He would wait like 15 seconds in order to encourage people to actually ask. I am the student who is scared to speak up in a big lecture, so I really liked that he did that. He was probably my favorite prof I’ve had so far."
