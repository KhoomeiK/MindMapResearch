depression,ff4o8x5,t1_ff4j55g,1579568435.0,"It's an incredibly intense and life-altering experience that eluded description, but if I could get in the ballpark of what it feels like, I'd say that it's like returning to the state-of-mind of your 5 year old self, along with all the delights and terrors that may bring.

It makes you incredibly vulnerable emotionally and in the right setting with people you know, trust, and can talk to about anything with, it has the potential to help you come to terms with things that happened to you when you were too young to understand, and were processed as thought and behavior changing trauma. You lose all the emotional baggage and it's like all the things that happened to you aren't there....the bad things that happened to you don't define you, and you're just there. Because you aren't thinking about those things you'll have a compassion for yourself and others that you didn't know was possible, and it's just so peaceful and serene just thinking about it right now is making me cry.

The flip side of this is that in a bad setting, a strange environment with the wrong people it can be quite disturbing and in rare cases, traumatizing. Since all those walls that came down that prevented you from connecting to yourself, other people and the world were also what was protecting you from the terrifying unknown. Everything you've been afraid of since you were a small child can come back.

I always have an unsettling feeling for the first 2 hours after taking LSD, and I have to sit down and hang tight for that time, otherwise it can get overwhelming to me: like last time I decided to go to the park after only an hour and the trees and playground looked very creepy...

I could imagine if I hadn't been experienced I could've freaked out over that but I took a deep breath and faced these fears and it put me at ease. Find plenty of distractions if you feel afraid, change what you are looking at or focusing on and it'll get better. 

Ultimately for me facing my biggest fears from early childhood like that, the darkest corners of my imagination is what made me realize that there's nothing to be afraid of, and that the twisted and disturbing reality happens hand-in-hand with the breathtakingly beautiful one. That they are one and the same, that the only difference is where we are standing when we look at it. 

That's what I saw, and everyone has a different experience so there's no guarantees, but all that I can tell you is that I had some severe, chronic depression and anxiety since I was a child, and after one trip it was gone. I just can't look at myself the same anymore having seen myself in that way, and I don't take myself seriously in that way. That internal narrative about being worthless or failure or whatever is gone and I feel alive for the first time."

depression,ff4hsmu,t1_ff4hgsg,1579563942.0,"While the January trip taught me to love myself the February trip taught me to enjoy the little things. I ended up looking all over my sisters house at all the pictures, decorations, trinkets, and plants she had. It all seemed to take on a magical quality that told stories all of their own. After that we went on a walk and veered off into the woods, which looked all dark and twisted. I heard a gunshot from a hunter in the distance and started hyperventilating, but managed to make my way back to the house before it got out of hand. I remember crying a waterfall of tears mourning my cat who died unexpectedly in 2017. A normally mundane day was something magical, and I felt a depth of emotion I hadn't felt in my adult or adolescent life. 

My trip in March caught me completely off-guard. I was measuring out liquid LSD and made a mistake, giving myself multiple hits instead of just one. I knew something was up when I was lying immobilized after half the usual time it takes to kick in. The music I was listening to, and all the light and colors felt so intensely real. I had visions of the lyrics playing out when I closed my eyes. I started falling deeper and deeper into that spiral of my mind. Eventually, I hit something and I was excited. Felt like a steam shovel in a churt pit that had uncovered something I had been looking for my whole life. My excitement faded quickly as I realised this disturbing truth and I couldn't get my mind off of it. There were these things living in my thoughts, banging at the door in my skull. This spiral turned into something diseased and twisted. I felt weak, loathsome, and pathetic. I wandered around the house, distraught and confused. Trapped in this loop. This desolate world. Looked outside into the sky and it didn't matter. I was trapped and the world was a dead-end. I went out to my car to get my hoodie because I was cold, and I leaned over my car roof all frustrated and miserable. I looked out into the field and realized how beautiful of a day it was, and I wondered how this could be when I felt so ugly inside, with all these imaginary tentacles lashing out at me. I walked over to the swing by the fire pit and started to rock back and forth, reminding myself that I was going to be okay. I started to relax and let go. I went on a walk and looked at all the pebbles in the driveway and realizing how perfect they fit together. I began to realize that I was worthy of love and that I had nothing to be afraid of. All these negative thoughts about myself were do to where I was standing, looking at myself in this negative light due to my past experiences, but I realized that it was over and that I'm okay now. Those things don't define me or anyone. We're all just these kids with extra baggage that we identify with but it doesn't have to be that way. We're all the same deep down and we really can and should love each other unconditionally. I realized that these strange beings that had been menacing me my entire life were really my mind's capacity for fear and doubt. I took those tentacles and embraced myself with them. It was dark and I could see that twisted spiral was my heart and veins glowing and pulsing with life in this beautiful void. The landscape turned into this beautiful watchful eye, with the setting sun in center, the woods in the top, field and roads in the bottom. The clouds shimmered and waved to me, and I cried cathartic tears of joy. So happy and falling in love with being alive. I remember being terrified of the night but this time I welcomed it! I looked into every dark corner, every creepy crawly hole. So delighted that what used to terrify me now felt like home in more ways than one. 

My April trip started out riveting, with eyes everywhere and the grass waving back and forth. I saw a cradle mobile of the solar system before it exploded into a scary jack-o-lantern face. After a spectacular come up I went outside and cried at the beauty of it all: sunlight shining through bamboo and fairy insects sailing the sun beams. After that it was a fairly ordinary evening with friends and family but I loved every moment of it. I was so glad to be there with all of them and I continue to be!"

depression,ff4cb9u,t1_ff4c5fb,1579560252.0,"I started out micro dosing late last year just to dip my toes in, and it was nice and all but was more of a drug experience: felt nice but no lasting change. 

My first full dose was in January. The come up was intense and I felt like I was melting a little but was quite serene and peaceful. The colors and patterns I began to see felt so native, I know i had seen and felt these things when I was a small child but had long forgot about them. My sister took me to see an old friend and we had a 4 hour conversation about life, society, emotions, the universe... Everything. At this point I noticed I could see different parts of myself that I had been blind to: my emotional patterns over the years, my relationships, all the things that happened to me that shaped me into who I was. It was like I was looking at the vulnerable inner child of myself and I had a self compassion that I had never felt before. At the end of the trip I walked down the driveway watching the sun set as I contemplated the infinite spiral of my reality stretched out before me. 

I have 3 more trip stories from February, March and April: it was those 4 that completely changed my life. The 3rd trip where I accidentally took too much was the most intense and meaningful 12 hours I have ever experienced, and I will never forget the things I felt on that day. Like my entire existence can be divided into before and after that afternoon.
