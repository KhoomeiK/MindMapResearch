bipolar,ffc1m6f,t3_eso93q,1579789243.0,"I just recently figured out that in order for me to protect my health I’m going to have to pretty much remove all the family that can’t understand me. Their ignorance and insensitivity to our illness is never going to sink in, and they only hurt me with their inability to get it. 

It really sucks, but that’s what I decided I just have to do for myself. It’s not worth getting triggered just to talk to them for a few minutes. Just yesterday I had to ask my oldest brother to just love me from a distance and not to call me anymore. His response solidified my decision."
SuicideWatch,ffab6lv,t3_es9ma0,1579731473.0,"My wife talked me into going to the MH for a quick interview...... I didn’t pass and was stuck there until they got me balanced out. It sucks to do, but sounds like you’re only real option that won’t involve the police."
SuicideWatch,ffaap63,t3_esfiud,1579731192.0,"That sounds slow and messy with a high chance of failure. Remember that feeling of being better and hold on to that memory until this “right now “ goes away. 

I’m suicidal right now too and that’s all I can do to hold on right now. It’s going to swing over to the other direction at some point, it always does."
bipolar,ffaa4ao,t3_esg282,1579730861.0,"Great way to look at it, wish my friends and family would see it that way. I’m still trying to this day to “snap out of it” for them. I’ll let you all know if I figure it out!"
bipolar,ff7as7c,t3_ervdes,1579644896.0,Bummer 😕
SuicideWatch,ff6z2b0,t3_es05l9,1579637831.0,"Can you afford to go two weeks away from work and check into the MH hospital? They are great places to get away for a little while and be pampered and safe. I know that I sound crazy for saying that someone should want to go to a MH hospital, however everyone is almost always glad that they went."
SuicideWatch,ff6n01d,t1_ff6isx6,1579630662.0,"I at least have some empathy for your situation and have almost followed through with my own suicidal thoughts and feelings since I was a teenager and it’s only been about 2 weeks since I wanted to jump off a roof here in the mental hospital which I’m stuck in until my meds are figured out. Been with 100’s of us for 32 days now. 

That’s why I said to “hang in there” I am still also having episodes of wanting to off myself too, even though I’m in treatment. I wrote my long suicide not in pass tense to everyone I loved and was about to do it because they let me outside and I had the opportunity. One week later I am starting to feel better and no longer feel that way. 

I’m going home to absolutely nothing when I get released other than the clothes I brought with me and a hundred bucks. Lost my wife, job, and everything that I worked for my entire life since I’ve been here. 

That’s why I am saying that if you can hold off, it could get better soon. This is as much of a chemical problem as it is a situational one. Respect your body’s chemistry 🧪 and maybe see if you can get it dialed in with some medication, at least during this time in your life. I’m on your side."
SuicideWatch,ff5zfc3,t3_ertp7t,1579615105.0,"Our whole point for being here is to offer support for people that are in your exact situation. I spent time looking online searching for methods myself, and know that through my experience suicide is a permanent solution for a temporary problem. Time will eventually snap you out of it if you can just hang in there."

SuicideWatch,ff1pvu4,t3_er3469,1579483541.0,"Sounds like me at 17, and I was built by the diversity that’s building you right now. If you can keep using this pain as building blocks for yourself you’re going to discover that you will have acquired the special skills of success. Maybe you will end up like me with a hot wife, 600k house and brand new truck. Remember that what you are dealing with, and learning to live through is real strength and power once mastered. Normal people will never have to train themselves like you and thus will be easy for you to out maneuver in the future. Just work on yourself and everything else will fall into place."
SuicideWatch,ff1oci4,t3_eqvbki,1579482571.0,"I checked in to the MH hospital just before Xmas and had a great holiday season with all the other awesome depressed and suicidal people just like me. Being in here getting better with all of them and getting my meds dialed in was the best thing I have ever done. If you’re going to kill you’re self then what do you have to lose? I’m still in here with my crew and going home a new man with nothing but the shirt on my back, but am so happy to be alive now and realize that whatever the problems are, we can change our present moments and that’s all that really matters. 

Don’t worry about the health insurance or anything else you think you can’t afford, or to be away from for 2-4 weeks of your life. If you kill yourself it won’t matter anyway. 

Just think about it, I know it doesn’t sound like fun, but just being in a place full of people going through the same shit as us, and having a full team of Drs at your disposal 24 hours a day to really get the meds figured out is a whole new chance to be happy."
SuicideWatch,ff1mjug,t3_er2o94,1579481656.0,Think about how strong you will be if you can wait until tomorrow.
SuicideWatch,ff1m64a,t3_er1yp1,1579481468.0,"I’m sure that you’ve figured out by now that this is serious depression and your brain could maybe use the help of some medications. I know exactly what you are talking about, just last week I was looking through those lenses and the good news is it only lasted for a day because of my meds. They aren’t a magic bullet, but can really lower it down and shorten the duration. Have you talked to a Dr about it? The right medication can literally give you back from the feeling of getting your soul ripped out for no apparent reason. The brain and it’s chemistry is amazing, and we do have access to really good ways to help it feel better. If you’re feeling these things and thinking about them, you might want to consider seeing what they can do for you."
bipolar,ff1k4lz,t1_ff1jp29,1579480469.0,Thanks for giving me the same feelings ❤️ you guys!
SuicideWatch,ff1ixon,t3_er4v52,1579479945.0,That’s why we keep our love in motion and don’t have to only give or receive it from “ loved ones” I’m loving your ass right now and I don’t know crap about you
SuicideWatch,ff1gc7r,t1_ff0q09q,1579478784.0,"Glad to hear, take care of that strong and beautiful heart you forged in these flames, and always remember that you are a survivor and tough as hell for just getting out of bed 😉"
bipolar,ff1fp3w,t1_ff0ognx,1579478496.0,"On my 30 day anniversary and it’s The best thing I could have done. Being able to get into a safe stress free environment to just work on myself and get the meds dialed in perfect was a life saver. Meeting a whole lot of people who are all going through the same things has been the experience of a lifetime, and the support we give each other is like no other true Bi-Polar love ❤️ is the best! I absolutely love my Bi-Polar people, you guys are truly the most beautiful people ever. 

I’m going home a new man on Friday ☺️"
SuicideWatch,ff08inw,t3_eqtl4w,1579466297.0,"Started going to AA meetings and the end we all get in a big circle and hug each other, sounds corny but it’s pretty nice when you don’t have anyone at home to hug."
bipolar,ff07ugg,t3_er14q5,1579466151.0,"Thanks for the good advice, I’m in a PHP mental health unit right now waiting for my Meds trying to figure out all the things that I have to change when I get released. Have to stop smoking the weed too, volunteer work is high on the list."
SuicideWatch,feyxt0w,t3_eqww8z,1579451757.0,"We are all going to die, but let’s shoot for it being in our hundreds and peacefully in our sleep after a great lifetime of love. The fact that you understand the suffering of depression alone is why we need you. Use the beautiful heart ❤️ you developed through your suffering and share it with our world, it needs your experience in such matters. A heart that has never hurt is a hollow shell incapable of understanding the things that you can. We need your soul here on earth, your work is not done yet."
SuicideWatch,feyc0wv,t3_eqrqrm,1579443530.0,"I hope that you made it through the night, I know that it’s hard. I wanted to end it all about a week ago and it went away. As fucked up as it sounds, I wrote a long suicide note to my friends and family in past tense and by the time it was done I felt better. Stay strong you can get through this"
bipolar,feu3j4x,t3_eql7g9,1579382753.0,"Great painting, I would hang it on my wall"

bipolar,fe9gxko,t3_emkdp0,1578937471.0,"25 mg 9:00 am , 25 3 pm and 100 at night. Tried a high dose of 400 a while back and hated it, however in low doses it’s pretty good."
bipolar,fe9gm9b,t3_em7862,1578937364.0,"Hang in there, sorry to hear that you are having a hard time. Beautiful view 🍀"
bipolar,fe9cy9j,t1_fe9bro4,1578936453.0,"Thank you for the information, will definitely look into it 🙏"
bipolar,fe9a41l,t1_fe8qu5r,1578935750.0,"Thank you, they transferred me into a drug rehab now to get more money out of my insurance. Being in the MH unit was great because I had a bunch of our kind and they were all beautiful people. Now I’m the only Bi-Polar person here and it sucks."
bipolar,fe64yej,t3_enqxzi,1578881887.0,Your so lucky 🍀 I’m in a MH program and my wife is leaving my ass as we speak from too much of it.
bipolar,fba78xs,t3_ec0h8p,1576668153.0,For me it’s like taking the drug Ecstasy with LSD but some how bone sober and clear headed without hallucinations at the same time if that makes any sense?
