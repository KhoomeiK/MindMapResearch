They just don't care.  There was ""normal"" spaces only a few metres farther away and 3/4 of the carpark was empty so they had ample parking but still chose to block our spaces.  If they get into trouble with their work over it they'll hopefully think twice before they do It again"
badparking,ffjypek,t1_ffjv9f4,1580010616.0,"The UK police don't do that. And it's a private car park (Tesco) so I've reported it to the company that deal with their parking.  I've also contacted tbe company that owns that van.  


Id love if the police did that, only traffic warden's do it (on public land) and you can never find one when you need them"

Showerthoughts,ffiii7o,t1_ffi3aan,1579974676.0,"Read it . It states : ""All that exists"". That covers everything, not just stuff we know about"
Showerthoughts,ffi1kww,t3_etr4lu,1579962341.0,Actually it does. It covers that - if I say I hate everything about something then I mean I hate everything I currently know and will hate everything I discover about it in the future.
