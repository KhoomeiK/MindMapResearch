3d6,ff91zjx,t1_ff8t9nt,1579702861.0,"Example. I have a character meant for taking hits and dishing shit. A duel opportunity arise. And a dex paldin wanted to give it a shot. We RP'ed. And my character, even though he would've done better conaidering the mitigation and high ac, stepped aside and let the other player go.

So your advuce is spot on. It isn't about the characyer but about the way you play him.

When you want to combine them though. Build a support character. That doesn't focus on doing damage or solving shit but more on having others succeed at it."
CasualConversation,ff5ltyl,t1_ff5ffl0,1579599232.0,Exactly. That cash never went though his cash register. Free money. No taxes need apply!
