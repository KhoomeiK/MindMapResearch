I'm glad I had my son when I was 22, because what you're describing breaks my heart. It will get easier though when they can move around on their own. When your kids can walk over to you. It will hurt because you can't get down and play with them the way you want to (even in my 20's I was already having trouble with this). But you will interact with them the best you can and from you they will learn to be more compassionate than other children, and I personally think that's a good thing, not a bad one.

They may get angry when they get a little older (7ish) but they quickly get over it. My son is 15 now, and he's a star. I'm a single mom and he helps when he knows that I need it, and he doesn't complain. He does it with a smile on his face, because he knows it always puts a smile on mine. If he sees that I haven't gotten out of bed since he got home from school, then often he'll offer to make dinner. It's usually just something frozen from the oven or eggs, but he's learning :)

He says you can't blame people for the things they can't control. That he knows I don't choose to be in pain, that no one would choose to be in terrible pain. He knows how I'm limited by it and how hard I've always tried to do things with him anyways. That we've gone and done things when I felt good, even though I knew I'd be in bed for a week afterwards. Even though I often hurt before we even left. 

Both of my own parents have neurological diseases, my father's was worse. I never wanted him to be my dad any less because of it though. Even once it limited what he could do. It may be that you can't hold your baby, but they won't remember it. My dad was always there for me. I could tell him anything, without judgement, and only get practical advice in return. That's what kids remembers. My mother is a narcissist so I don't have issues with her because she has multiple sclerosis, they're because she behaves terribly and says awful things."

They wiggle on the way down. I can't imagine downing whatever that was full of them (metric equivalent of whatever a 40oz of cheap beer is around there would be my guess)."

The expert that was consulted had this to say to that,

WatchPeopleDieInside,fg5kyhr,t1_fg58kj6,1580530342.0,"You're basing this entire line of thought on a drunk persons error, and the fact that you don't ""think"" you've ever microwaved anything for more than ten minutes. In reality though, it's pretty difficult to start a fire in the microwave unless you're trying to. 

You pretty much have to put something in the microwave that was never intended to be microwaved to start a fire, like it's not that hard with metal if there's also something in there that will burn. Or styrofoam can start a fire if it gets hot enough. Eggs in the shell will explode but are unlikely to start a fire, there's some other food stuffs in the unlikely category, like raisins (though I always microwave picadillo, it has raisins and nothing bad has ever happened but maybe it would if you put them in there for an hour or something).

This video is a perfect example of how difficult it is to start a fire under normal conditions though. This guy accidently microwaved a pot pie meant to go in for five minutes for fifty minutes. He didn't start a fire, only charred it so badly it resembled a charcoal briquette.

Besides selling both your ""10 minute maximum"" model and the models we already have would increase the price by screwing up the savings afforded by economies of scale. It's just a silly idea. All you need to do is pay attention to what you're doing if you're that concerned about starting a fire. If you're really worried there are lists of things that could potentially catch fire in a microwave online, so you can avoid microwaving those items."

Specifically so stupid shit like this doesn't happen. When this happens it's because they're lazy, or perhaps just very dumb. Especially when they're this far off. Being off by a few inches I can understand, that's a more reasonable error of judgement. This idiot was off by at least a couple feet, if not more like three, that's a major screw up."

When I worked in a law office doing probate I interacted some with a social worker that worked with seniors. She said she was constantly having to educate them about STD's and why using condoms was important. 

All the STD's are apparently a big issue in the senior community, from the fairly easy to treat chlamydia and gonorrhea, to the have it forever but at least it's just unpleasant herpes, to potentially deadly HIV. And HIV is more serious for seniors than younger people. Seniors may not be able to tolerate the necessary medication regiments as well because of pre-existing health issues, like liver or kidney impairments. Or it's a bigger problem because they're already immunocompromised for other reasons."
