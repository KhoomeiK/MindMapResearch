bulletjournal,fddyko1,t1_fddy9ud,1578327105.0,"It’s funny you say that. After I commented earlier, I looked up some notebooks with this kind of paper, and I saw some on the archer and olive website. I decided when I need a new journal that I’m going to give this a shot. Just gotta make sure I have the right pens!"
bulletjournal,fddpj01,t3_ekkfgf,1578320471.0,"Wow, that’s stunning! I love seeing pictures of blackout notebook bujos. Nothing I would ever have the time to do, but I’m appreciative of the inspiration nonetheless!"
ThriftStoreHauls,fd7612b,t1_fd6g1r8,1578199890.0,I came here to say the exact same thing. I had one of these too. I loved that old lamp! I can’t remember what we ever did with mine.... but your post has me kinda wishing I still had it!
HaircareScience,fd72wyh,t1_fd6og0g,1578198763.0,"I have tried a lot of and so far, these are products I’ve repurchased, most of them quite a few times:

*Aveda rosemary mint shampoo and conditioner*— this is a rediscovery of mine and is what I am currently using (smells slightly medicinal, but in a relaxing, spa kind of way)

*Arrojo Daily conditioner* (red label) 

*NatureLab Tokyo Volumizing shampoo and conditioner*— I used this after I bleached my hair 2 years ago and all other color care products gave me flat hair :(

*Olaplex No 6 bond smoother*— I’m also a fan of their shampoo and conditioner, but I feel like I went through the bottle oddly fast and it isn’t cheap

*Matrix Air dry wild boho texturizing cream* 

*Hask Chia seed volumizing dry shampoo* cheap, and I feel like it makes day old waves look so much better

I know it’s not a totally CG friendly list, and it seems like a surprising number of people in other hair subreddits don’t seem to care for Aveda. If it helps, when looking for new products to try, avoid “wavy/curly” hair products, and instead aim for “weightless” products and see how you make out!

Edit: posted under the wrong thread"
HaircareScience,fd6nd71,t1_fd5p07t,1578193410.0,"I second this so hard. For years I kept trying to treat my wavy hair as if it was just super curly hair that hadn’t figured out how to ‘do its thing’ yet. It isn’t.

When I finally realized my hair was low porosity and I needed to stop weighing it down so much, I switched to a weightless shampoo and conditioner and it made all the difference. I still do a deep conditioning mask once or twice a week, but otherwise, I use a conditioner that is so light that when I first started using it, I was pretty convinced that it wasn’t going to work. Now I have the best hair that I’ve had in years. I also stopped using serums, oils, and gels on my hair.  If I use any kind of hair product, it’s a lightweight texturizing cream or a tiny tiiiiiny bit of the olaplex leave in conditioner.

Wavy hair life... if you weigh it down too much it’s just going to look like straight hair on a humid day, but if you try too hard to make it “curly,” you’ll be disappointed at your lack of results."
