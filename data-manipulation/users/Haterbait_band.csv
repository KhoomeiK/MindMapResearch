It’s almost like a “service tax” that keeps getting increased by some corrupt government that knows people will pay it, only it’s actually optional and they guilt you into paying. They’d love for tips to be suggested starting at 30%, or more. Tipping culture is outdated and the US needs to catch up with the rest of the world and get rid of it. Just pay people a bit more and stop making us reward good service that should already be the standard."

Some changes in regulations and food handling education can go a long way to make things safer for everyone. But instead of focusing on the *problem*, people are using the outbreak to attack the types of animals that these people eat, and *have* eaten for a very long time. That’s the part that is xenophobic, but not exactly racist. Racism is hating them, while what I’m seeing is people that are just not thinking outside their little bubble.

I’d be getting awards and promotions, but I’d always have to keep the heat off by doing kinda dumb shit all the time. It’s easier than it sounds actually, once you’re used to it. You just gotta do things that are detrimental to yourself and others for nonsensical reasons and people will assume you’re just another dense peasant. For starters, blast snot rockets onto bus seats so nobody sits near you. Wipe your ass and stick the tp to the walls of the bathroom. Smoke cigarettes near entrances of buildings and toss the butts into the street, preferably with a cocky flick of the fingers before turning carelessly away, like a movie hero from an explosion. Yell inconsiderately in places that are otherwise quiet, like a Cemetary or a move theater. Be rude to your waiters at restaurants, make a mess, and don’t tip a dime. Talk on your phone on speaker phone *all the time*, for extend periods, about dumb shit. The list goes on..."

funny,ff3wr6p,t3_erhcm5,1579550533.0,"Anthropomorphism! Humans *love* anthropomorphism, particularly when concerning non-human animals. I think it stems from us *wanting* to understand the world around but also being limited by our own experiences and perspectives. We’re humans, and so we think and feel like a human does. We can empathize and sympathize with other humans because of our similarities, even if that isn’t always accurate. Then, we attempt to extend this limited understanding onto, say, a dog, where we apply our own feeling onto them based upon their actions and situation, even though they’re completely different forms of life. For example, we might say a dog is happy when it’s “smiling”, when this “smile” is really just a facial expression that we strongly equate to being happy *in humans*. Then we can also do this with inanimate objects, like feeling like throwing away your old stuffed animal as it stares at you from the trashcan, wondering why you hate it. I guess it would be better to avoid anthropomorphism, since it’s an inaccurate perspective created in our limited human minds, although to go do so is more difficult than you might think."

We can empathize and sympathize with other humans because of our similarities, even if that isnâ€™t always accurate. Then, we attempt to extend this limited understanding onto, say, a dog, where we apply our own feeling onto them based upon their actions and situation, even though theyâ€™re completely different forms of life. For example, we might say a dog is happy when itâ€™s â€œsmilingâ€, when this â€œsmileâ€ is really just a facial expression that we strongly equate to being happy *in humans*. Then we can also do this with inanimate objects, like feeling like throwing away your old stuffed animal as it stares at you from the trashcan, wondering why you hate it. I guess it would be better to avoid anthropomorphism, since itâ€™s an inaccurate perspective created in our limited human minds, although to go do so is more difficult than you might think."
