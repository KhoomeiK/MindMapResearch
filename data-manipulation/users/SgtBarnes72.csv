depression,fcz93ds,t3_ejnao7,1578096147.0,I’ve been this way for a long time and when I was young and didn’t really know what was going on I used to over share a lot.  I felt bad for burdening people and that was in usually done in person.  I always think that I have it easier than others.  Venting doesn’t help that much I’ve found .  But expressing yourself does.  It’s important to feel understood.  And try not to hang any validation on whether or not your posts get responses.  I’ve tried it on here too and also given up.  A therapist can help sort all the venting into something more constructive.  Good luck and feel better.

MindHunter,fcge5l7,t1_fcfrpqz,1577639051.0,I know it’s a true story.  But the elements were so familiar that they needed little explanation.  Maybe 20 years of SVU is enough for me.

MindHunter,fccggsj,t3_egupny,1577598115.0,"Seemed very cliche in the first episode and a half.  That’s when I stopped.  The insincere and dismissive police officers who don’t believe.  The compassionate police officer we are introduced to before any crime happens.  I know it’s a true story, but it was still framed in very familiar ways that appear in almost all tv or movies about sexual assault."
