bettafish,felztpp,t3_ept46j,1579235276.0,She‚Äôs gorgeous and similar to my newest betta Mako but he‚Äôs a half moon. May I ask what those other schooling fish are that you have with her??
shrimptank,felz21u,t1_felydyq,1579234634.0,Thank you so much for this info! I read something similar so I‚Äôm glad to hear. I‚Äôm going to have to keep a closer eye now and I‚Äôm definitely going to purchase some Paraguard as well. My biggest concern is I have 30 or so baby shrimps atm that recently hatched last week. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to get all their molts. Do you happen to have any knowledge on how much this could affect them at such a young age?

shrimptank,felnzm8,t1_felmysj,1579226740.0,"I believe so, at least that‚Äôs what the store I bought them from had them labelled as. They ended up giving me a baby red and what looks like a baby brown shrimp too from the same tank."

Jarrariums,fe9wsj5,t3_eo4w1k,1578942165.0,I think I may have one of these too. I noticed it when it was really little but didn‚Äôt realize what it was till I did further research. When I went back to look I couldn‚Äôt find it so I guess once it‚Äôs this size it won‚Äôt be too hard to miss!

painting,fe5y429,t1_fe55jr7,1578877526.0,It doesn‚Äôt matter that they are just clouds. There‚Äôs actually emotion in these paintings because of the placement and the colors/tones.
