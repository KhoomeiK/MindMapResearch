The extremely simplified answer: **being selfish works more frequently than being cooperative, but the net payoff (sum of all participants gain/loss) ends up lower.** If you don't know the character and intentions of who you're dealing with, you can mitigate their potential bad faith (stalemate) or exploit their good faith (win) by acting in some from of bad faith.

nottheonion,ffcoer6,t1_ffce7bp,1579803778.0,"From the perspective of a guy who used to work in retail banking, there's a lot to understand about this story.

12 hours to clear the check = next business day funds were available. Very likely that the checks were drawn on Chase in a positive pay account, which are confirmed legitimate by already being indexed (e.g. some system knows:  *JOHN DOE, check #112233 for $XXXXX.XX, dated MM/DD/YYYY*). This is sitcom level misunderstanding resulting in bad treatment and embarrassment that will likely end up in a lawsuit and future anti-descrimination training at other banks.

As for why the bank behaved in what's assumed to be obvious discrimination:
The guy had almost no money in his account and wanted to deposit two large checks (likely out of normal deposit amount for most people) and cash a check for $8,000 (an amount that is close to but below the federal reporting requirement) without funds to cover should the check have been fraudulent. The check appeared different from normal checks observed by the employees (they've likely NOT seen a settlement check from that company) and the cash request reinforced their suspicion. It is common to call the police on suspected fraudulent checks, as it's a felony and often a part of organized crime.

Where they REALLY SCREWED UP was by not attempting further due diligence. For example, calling the people who issued the check, googling the guy's name and ""lawsuit"", and not knowing their customer at all. One of the key giveaways that this was legitimate was that the guy stuck around and waited while they ""tried to validate the check"". That's typically NOT something check fraudsters will do-- they want to GTFO as quickly as possible! Had they done that small bit of leg work and taken a few minutes to talk to the guy in private, they wouldn't have called the police, inconvenienced and mistreated the guy, opened themselves up for a possible lawsuit and bad PR, and generally looked like fools."

personalfinance,fecbdzs,t1_fec25ku,1578970099.0,"Simplify it a bit. It's basically a 50/50 allocation with potential extremes on the tails. The worst five-year rolling RoR for a true 50/50 allocation since 1950 is still above zero, and loss aversion is a serious thing to the average investor.

personalfinance,febu4ca,t1_feayhc0,1578962675.0,"Ideal expense ratio is generally the lowest available for your investment objective, risk tolerance, and time horizon, unless there's an actual benefit for the cost associated with the fund (e.g. returns net of fees, or screening methodology which should lead to the former). Fidelity has some very solid funds which have historically beaten benchmarks on many occasions.

*Alpha* and *Beta* are what you want to look for in anything actively managed. If you pay a hypothetical 2.0% expense ratio while consistently outperforming index equivalents net of expense (alpha) without extra risk (beta<1) it could still be a great fund to keep. It's hard (maybe impossible) find that in equity funds, particularly during bull markets, but it can be found in specialized investment strategies like sector funds and various parts of the fixed income sphere. 

In short, you're probably okay, but you should verify that by seeing how each of your investments ranks compared to their peers and seek out lower fee options if you feel it's appropriate."
