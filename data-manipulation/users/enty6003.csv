mildlyinfuriating,fehnwxj,t1_fehj4dw,1579120364.0,"It's hard to say. Ads are typically served through JavaScript so will probably load slower. If anything it's probably in advertisers interests to have ads load as quickly as possible, so that users see them at the same time as they see the rest of the content. Similarly, publishers will be more likely to use those ads if they load quickly, as this will avoid slowing down their pageload too much.

What's more, the ad servers tend to earn money based on impressions, rather than clicks. 

So it's basically in the interest of the publishers, ad servers / ad agencies, and the brands paying for the advertising, for ads to load fast and fully.

As someone that works in the industry, the tactic described above does not sound feasible to me at all. Maybe some cowboys in the early days of digital advertising. But really, how often is someone going to buy a product after being made to click an ad they had no interest in?"
