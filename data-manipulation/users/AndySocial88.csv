I agree the world is shit but comments like yours only show me that there are people that want to make it worse."
worldnews,fcwqxf3,t1_fcwqj76,1578034102.0,"Trump is itching to use a nuke. Which will break every human rights law globally and make the US the global bad guy even more so. Iran hits us while he's in office, Trump will drop a big boy out of pure reactionary thinking. It's like we didn't learn from century ago. WWI started from an assassination around the same decades. So long and behold Agent Orange is keeping his promise to bring us back to the good old days."
worldnews,fcwqjg7,t1_fcwn6q7,1578033697.0,"It's because of that that it's in bad taste. Throw on a /s and you would probably would seem like a normal person. But because you don't see how shitty your comment was and if in the future a lot of people die, it just seems like you don't give a shit about human lives. This is a lot more serious and your comment doesn't matter but you as an individual don't seem to give a shit what'll happen."
