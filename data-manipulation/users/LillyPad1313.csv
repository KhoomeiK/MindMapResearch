aww,fg47dsj,t1_fg462p5,1580497705.0,"I think there are some good things about zoos. For one thing, if Koala populations are continuing to dwindle because of the Australian fires, zoos (where they treat the koalas well of course) will be keeping them from going extinct. It’s the same thing with okapis.
That said, many zoos that are operational right now shouldn’t be. So many abuse animals for human entertainment, and it’s disgusting"
