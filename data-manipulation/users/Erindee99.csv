PaleMUA,fdnvhhh,t3_em9o66,1578593674.0,"Hooooly crap you're gorgeous. You look like a model.
You look cool or neutral toned to me, but you should upload another pic in brighter, natural light in order for me to really tell :)
Also you should go to Ulta, they have little testers on all their foundations so you could try them out on your skin and see what looks best on you!

Edit: My face is darker than my neck too. It's pretty normal for us pale peeps."
