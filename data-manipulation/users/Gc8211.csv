Games,ffd7knf,t1_ffd1efx,1579814961.0,"> These companies should release the server binaries so that people can run them themselves when the company behind the game doesn't feel like running them anymore.


That's not so easy sometimes. Do they release them as is with no support? Or do they spend the time to write detailed instructions? Or open a forum for people to ask for support? Most of the time it's not as easy as just running a binary. You have to install services, edit scripts, configure dozens of settings, etc, etc. Sometimes you need very specific builds of frameworks to get them to work and overtime those frameworks become security liabilities or dont run properly on modern operating systems and then the binaries fail to run using updated frameworks.


So that leaves us with the developers releasing the source code to the binaries to prevent the problems above. That is another bag of worms. They could be using proprietary libraries or licensed code. This means they would have to strip all that out and release source code that would need some work to compile. Back in 1997 iD Software had to release the Linux source code of Doom because the DOS version used a licensed sound library."
politics,ffctxl7,t1_ffcalec,1579807190.0,"Here is how I look at it:

* Democrats are getting what they want which is a platform to discuss everything out in the open and put people on record.
* The vast majority of this country have made up their minds on both the Democrat side and Republican side.
* The Democrats are trying to win over that small segment that could turn the general election in their favor.
* Trump is publicly saying he wants people to testify to exonerate him while at the same time blocking it.
* The Republicans are blocking testimony and evidence as well.


If in November the election goes south for the Republicans then the Senate can point the blame at the president and say he refused to defend himself and allow witnesses and evidence. The president can then point the finger back saying he publicly stated he wanted witnesses and evidence brought forth so he could defend himself. And the Democrats wont care because they will control the House and Presidency. It gives everyone a way out of this mess."

That's the nefarious observation. The reality is that the tax cuts were going back to the idea that if you reduce taxes on corporations they will have more freedom to grow and as a result spend more which in turn will trickle down to the middle and lower class. We found out back in the 1980s that this theory doesnt really work. Corporations benefit but the trickle down effect only hits a small portion of the lower classes."

Don't just focus on the banks. It showed that any industry could play risky markets and if the industry was a big enough player to bring down the economy they would be bailed out. A lot of people didn't want the automotive industry to be bailed out in 2008/2009 but to minimize the affects of the recession and speed up recovery the government decided to bail them out.

They had like two studies they cited that were considered inconclusive to determining rather second hand smoking was dangerous. They ignored the fact that many other studies existed that showed second hand smoke was most likely dangerous. Was it as dangerous as smoking directly? No, but it still was pretty bad depending on your exposure. Spending an hour in someones house while they smoke probably won't do anything to you but living 18 years with someone who smokes in the same house while growing up will probably cause you some issues. I think they also brought up that genetics play a role which they do. Some people smoked their entire lives and developed only some of the symptoms but that was only true for a small segment. That's like saying HIV cant infect everyone because some small segment of the population in Northern Europe is immune to it because of genetics and then declaring HIV to be bullshit. The CDC has several pages with numerous studies showing how second hand smoke is not good for you. Not sure how long after the episode but P&T eventually retracted their statements on second hand smoking not being dangerous but they stood by their statements on smoking bans being bullshit.

television,ff9zue0,t1_ff8svda,1579725024.0,"It's a little more complicated then that. Conan had a contract negotiation in 2001 and NBC was worried Conan would jump ship so they offered Conan the ability to be the 5th host of The Tonight Show by 2009. Jay Leno was not informed of this agreement until 2004 and NBC only extended him out to 2009.


Conan and Jay are two different styles of humor. Conan's style appeals to younger folks and Jay appeals to older folks. Now in 2001 the television market was much different. The internet was still mainly 56k which didnt allow easy streaming of video. Channels like Cartoon Network and Comedy Central were just starting to find their footing with late night. But by 2009 the internet was changing the entertainment landscape and channels like Cartoon Network had Adult Swim and Comedy Central had John Stewart and Colbert. Young adults had more options and the market was more segmented where as older folks were not really moving. So in 2009 when Jay Leno was consistently winning the ratings among all talk shows he had to contractually step down. However, this allowed him to shop himself around. Now NBC had a problem. They were contractually obligated to Conan and had no control over Jay Leno.



So NBC made a deal with Jay Leno to have an earlier show at 9pm and Conan would have The Tonight Show. Audiences didnt respond to Jay Lenos show and Conan was losing to his competitors. NBC was pressured by advertisers and affiliates to do something about the mess so they planned on pushing Conan back and giving Jay his old timeslot back. This didnt jive with Conan so he bailed.


Jay Leno ended up taking all the heat while the problems all started with NBC. Johnny Carson stepped down when he was 66 and on his own terms. Jay was by all accounts forced out at 59 and with a 17 year tenure compared to Carsons 30 year tenure. Had Jay Leno been suffering in ratings I could see why he was forced out but he was still leading the ratings by the time Conan took over.



TL;DR - NBC messed up. Jay was forced to retire. Conan couldnt match Jay ratings."

* The same day the victim’s body was discovered, Investigator Grady Eleam and his partner, Sergeant Anna Marie Williams, were assigned to investigate the case. They spoke with the victim’s boyfriend, Luther Winn. He stated that he had last seen the victim at 2:00 a.m., before he went to work. Winn told the officers that the appellant may have been with the victim on the day of her death. The officers confirmed that Winn had an alibi for the crime because he was at work from 3:30 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. They learned later that the appellant was scheduled to work on July 3, 4, and 5, but he did not show up.

She could not see the vehicle’s license plate number, but she saw the silhouette of a person inside the house. She assumed the person was male because of the person’s height and build. When she drove by at 11:00 a.m., the car was gone. On July 24, 1995, Investigator Eleam showed Cowell photographs of the appellant’s brother’s Camaro. She stated that the vehicle in the photograph was consistent with the vehicle she saw at the abandoned house. Although the police searched the abandoned house and the Camaro, they found no evidence that connected the appellant to the victim’s murder.

The appellant's girlfriend gave a description of a car that matched the witness vehicle description:

* Investigator Eleam spoke with the appellant’s girlfriend, Roslen Beard Butler, on July 10. Butler said that the appellant had lived with her for two and one-half years. Butler said that on July 5, the appellant left for work at 6:30 a.m. When Butler came home from work, he told her he had left work around noon. Butler said that she asked the appellant on July 8, 1995, to leave her house because of his involvement with drugs, and he went to live with his
mother. Butler said that the appellant drove a black and gray Chevrolet Camaro that he had borrowed from his brother with the intention of buying it. However, the appellant’s brother repossesed the car shortly after July 10, 1995.

I'm not copying this but the appellant voluntary went to the police station in 1995 and put himself with the victim on the day of her murder, stated they had sex, and I believe put himself at the location of where the body was found. His statement can be found on page 4.

Here seems to be the most damning part according to the appeal court:

* The appellant also argues that the State failed to sufficiently prove premeditation. We disagree. The proof at trial revealed that the appellant confessed to killing a woman named Joyce, whose last name may have been Goodman, in Ashland City around 1991. The appellant said that he beat her to death. Moreover, the appellant acknowledged in a statement to police that he was with the victim on the morning of July 5, 1995, and that he paid her for
sex. Later that morning, the victim’s body was found in an abandoned house, wrapped in a rug that had been doused with an accelerant and set on fire. A bloodstained cinder block was lying on the victim’s head. The proof at trial established that the victim’s death was caused by multiple blunt force blows and multiple stab wounds. We conclude that a jury could have found these facts sufficient to establish premeditation.


Here is some details on his appeal. There is a rather large section that is full of legal writing talking about how his confession was not invalidated because he wasn't read his miranda rights. There is another large section on his appeal where he claimed his state of mind and medication caused him to hallucinate and confess but it doesn't appear that the appeals court bought into the claim. He also tried to argue the autopsy report violated his sixth amendment right because he was unable to question the original pathologist who wrote the original report.


Remember a conviction is done through reasonable doubt. Not everything has to be perfect, just reasonable. So whats more reasonable to believe? A known suspect voluntarily confesses to a crime where he was already a suspect and where an automobile described at the scene of the crime matched the vehicle in his possession, and where he voluntarily stated shortly after the murder that he was with the victim and that they had sex. Or, he was hallucinating and falsely confessed to a crime and everything else was just a coincidence.


None of the major publications talked about these details in their articles. The real title should be, ""Man on deathbed confesses to murder which corroborated statements he voluntarily gave to police shortly after the victim as found."", but that's not easy click bait."
Games,fe0xa6z,t1_fe0wilc,1578819754.0,The wind waker run did a really great job at describing how the glitches worked and why. At one point they went into detail on how they were filling the system RAM up to cause different events to happen and even cause full system resets on purpose.
Games,fe0wexh,t1_fe0ts4m,1578819513.0,Have they banned people or just not invite them back or invite them at all? At the end of the day it's a charity event and needs to be kept reasonably clean. You also dont want the charities to walk away from the event because of bad press. It's a private event and the organizers have the last say. If the best speed runner of a game is well known to be aggressive or racist on their stream then it's not worth inviting them. If an invited speed runner shows up drunk to their speed run then they dont deserve to come back again. If the speed runner is known for foul language and the event invites them but asks them to tone it down and they dont then the organizers dont have to invite them back.
Games,fe0kx1a,t1_fe0jjvq,1578815248.0,"I'll be honest. The highlight events of the entire week were the special events.

* Super Mario World One Mind - Two people, two controllers, and every 2 seconds or so the game switches to the other player. So it takes a lot of coordination to complete each level.
* Zelda Link to the Past Crowd Control Randomizer - Link to the Past where the items of the game are randomized. So where you get the bow and arrow in the original release might be where you get the hammer. Then add in that Twitch viewers were able to interfere with the player by either giving him something that helps him like full health or just straight up kill him.
* Super Mario Maker 2 - Eight original maps made just for AGDQ. Two teams of four compete against eachother, first team to beat a map earns one point. If neither team beats the map in 8 minutes it's a draw and they move onto the next map. Oh, and no one on either team have played the maps yet.


Probably the most fun I've seen at any AGDQ event. It was also a nice break between speedruns to see something different. Hopefully they continue to schedule these events but also not let them overrun the event cause it could be tempting to do so.


Edit:

Forgot these two events:

* Mike Tyson Punch Out - Two players, one controller, blindfolded.
* Amid Evil - An FPS speedrun but at the last minute the developers were invited to join over Skype. 25 minutes of the developers swearing while in disbelief while their game was broken apart by a speedrunner.


My only disappointment:

* Super Mario 64 Randomizer - Three separate players played Super Mario 64 that was randomized. It was very difficult to follow as each player could go a unique path. It was hard to tell who was where and doing what. Outside of the star count it was hard to tell who was in the lead. Even the commentators warned that even if someone is ahead ten stars that doesnt mean much because they went for the easy stars. The speed runners did great, the commentators were great, but I just dont think that randomizer worked with three players competing.


Edit:


I also found that the production of the event is much better now. I think most speed runners now understand that this event is about charity first and show casing your game and the community around it second and not so much about setting a speed running record. It's great when they do set records but I find the speedruns more interesting when you describe what you're doing and why the game behaves a certain way or the technical details behind glitches. I think most speed runners either came prepared themselves or had someone on the couch ready to help them out. Nothing sucks more then a speedrun with little to no explanation or commentary to explain what's going.


In prior years they really pushed reading donation comments and in some cases it felt like the donation comments were getting more focus then the speed runners themselves. Starting last summer with SGDQ it felt like they really backed off the donation comments and did a much better job at letting the speed runners and commentators do more of the talking and just sprinkle in comments when they could. It seemed like this year the speed runners and commentators would signal when to read donations or if the event organizers asked it was to read big donations, mile stones, or special donations.


Edit:

The Terraria speedrun. Only way to describe this speedrun is to call it Frankenstein's monster. The speed runner and his commentary was great. However, almost nothing went right. This speedrun required so much crazy manipulation to pull off correctly. And so many things went wrong and they had to stop the run because it went over. However, the speed runner kept positive the entire run and I hope they bring him back again to give him another chance.


I probably missed a bunch because I couldn't watch the entire event. There was definitely some great cringe and it wouldnt be AGDQ without it. However, I started watching in 2014 and the entire event has really matured over the years."
