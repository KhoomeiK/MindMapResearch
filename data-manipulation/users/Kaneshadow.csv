That's a good article, but there's a lot of back-and-forth.  It doesn't conclude anything is fake, it just presents several different ways to interpret things and gives Sanders the benefit of the doubt in processing the info to come up with a 1-line for his stump speech.  It's also discussing his claim that it was $1 trillion, so clearly he's since adjusted his numbers based on something. 

The amount is less important than the greater point: the government provided great financial leniency to corporations in trouble.  So why is everyone so resistent to helping individuals?  Why does any social help get derided as communism?  The bank bailouts were to keep the wheels turning to keep everyone employed.  Fair enough.  So, if you're keeping people employed on the corporate level, why not on the individual level, especially when the amount wouldn't even be as high?  Do you know the good a $400 billion bailout would do for the struggling underclass?  (For those people AND for the economy, because that money would be spent immediately.)  Who is more deserving of it, poor citizens who had a bad run of luck or just suck at life?  Or these institutions that acted out of pure greed?  

And outside of the tweet we're commenting on, the point remains that 1 CEO was punished.  Most of the CEOs of the bailed out companies turned a profit by the end, via stock shares or what have you.  That's not a good look."
