AskReddit,fe3y0sg,t1_fe2k9mf,1578853919.0,"Honestly, words on a screen/paper will only get you so far. During culinary school I had the opportunity to work in a small group of 4 students with a high end chef from Turin for 6 weeks, 4hrs/day 5 days a week. We spent half of that time just cooking risotto after risotto until we could make it almost perfect--the chef's words were that we'd never make it perfect because we didn't learn it from our grandmother's and make it our whole lives. 

But, the steps and ingredients are simple enough to list--doing them properly takes hands on instruction and guidance to know the right times to add more stock, adjust seasonings, etc. 

Put a large stock pot on high heat filled with vegetable, chicken, veal, or fish stock (depending on your final dish). Bring to a rolling boil then reduce to a medium simmer. It's best to have more stock than you actually expect to use.  As a general rule, I heat up 6 cups of stock for every cup of rice I plan to use.

Medium sauce pot on high heat, add a few tablespoons EVOO.  Add 1/4 cup minced white onion and reduce heat to medium-high, sweat onions until translucent but do not brown. 

Add two handfuls of carnaroli rice per serving. Stir to coat evenly in the EVOO, and constantly stir until it starts to smell like popcorn and it makes a certain crackling sound, akin to Rice Krispy cereal when you pour milk into it.  Now, add about ½ cup of a white wine like Pinot grigio or Fiano, and stir vigorously while it reduces.  Add a pinch of sea salt or kosher salt.

When the rice and wine is au sec, ladle in enough hot stock to cover and submerge the rice by about 1 knuckle. Check seasoning, and you will likely need a pinch of salt at this stage. Aim to have the saltiness stay at just shy of perfect until after you add the cheese at the end. Return heat to high and stir with a wooden spoon vigorously and constantly. The rice should never stop moving from this point until the heat is shut off. Use an even pattern of stirring that covers every part of the pan equally; you should be able to complete a full rotation of this pattern every 1-2 seconds.  Add additional ladles of stock as needed to keep the rice looking fairly liquid and loose during most of the process-the right timing is based in a certain look to the rice and the liquid in the pot. Adding stock too quickly will prevent you from properly developing the starches, but adding too little stock or waiting too long can result in gumminess. At sea level, this stage should take about 15-20 minutes (my mentor claimed if it wasn't 17 minutes you did something wrong, and while I think that was a bit of a joke, my Italian wasn't good enough to be certain). You should be checking the seasoning every time you are about to add more stock and adjusting it as necessary. 

Once the rice is al dente and the right creaminess has been developed, shut off the heat and remove pot from the cook top. Assuming 4-6 servings, place ~1 cup of finely grated Parmesan reggiano on top and a couple pads/T of cold butter and let sit for 2-3 minutes but do not stir. After it has sat, you grab the handle and make a motion almost like you are flipping an egg, but not quite.  The goal here to to make large waves in the risotto that incorporate air and the cheese into the dish (all'onda). Stirring the cheese in doesn't achieve the same airiness and results in a gummy texture compared to all'onda. Adjust seasoning, and serve immediately. Risotto does not lend itself well to leftovers, but leftovers make a fantastic arancini.

If you are making risotto milanese, you bloom the saffron in a ladle of stock and use that as the final ladle of stock before adding the cheese and butter all'onda. Other types of risotto require adding the featured ingredient at different stages in the process depending on what it is (pureed asparagus/peas/greens, carrots, mushrooms, etc.)

AskReddit,fe3nizv,t1_fe2brmg,1578851023.0,"Just about anything that you dump cream, cheese, and salt in will be ""tasty"" to most people.  But, doing a risotto that way is ham fisted, overly heavy, and frankly, not really risotto--aka garbage.  Think Wonderbread versus a nice, homemade cottage/pullman loaf of white bread.  Wonderbread is tasty until you have the real thing.  

The only reason you would need to add cream to a risotto is because you did not properly develop the starches from the rice to build the body and creamy texture of the dish. This is likely because you did not stir enough, and/or used the wrong type of rice."
AskReddit,fe0qbfm,t1_fdyzbgs,1578817371.0,"If you need to add cream to your risotto, you are doing it wrong. Very wrong. 

Making a risotto that is tasty and decent isn't terrible hard for most people to learn. But, making a truly beautiful and excellent risotto is very challenging and requires a great deal of effort to properly execute.  And when you eat an excellent risotto next to an ""easy"" risotto you'll understand why those easy risotto recipes are just garbage."
