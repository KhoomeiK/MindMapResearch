>	In 1950, **Truman had sent troops to the Korean War without Congressional approval**.[17] In 1952, Truman feared a national strike by the steel industry would impair the military's ability to fight the Korean War. **He ordered the Secretary of Commerce to seize and operate the steel mills without Congressional approval**.[18] The Supreme Court found the actions unconstitutional. The majority of justices stated that the Commander-in-Chief clause of the constitution did not apply to domestic matters and that the president must comply with existing laws on this matter.[19]

>	By 1952, Truman increased the Armed Services to 3.6 million, and that by itself resulted in an increase in presidential power. **Before then, only Lincoln had increased the Army without Congressional approval**. The addition of 50 treaties increased presidential responsibilities and power in the 1950s.[20] **The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), under the direction of the president, overthrew the governments of Iran (1953) and Guatemala (1954)**. **The CIA attempted but failed to overthrow the government of Indonesia**. Also, the CIA helped organize Cuban refugees to overthrow the Cuban government (1960–1961).[21] The presidency's control of foreign policy vastly increased while constitutional separation of powers decreased.[22] In the decade after the Korean War, most liberal and conservative members of Congress agreed on presidential control of foreign policy.[23]

>	The Cuban Missile Crisis showed that independent and unilateral presidential action in extreme circumstances is, at times, required. However, it was a unique situation of threat and secrecy in the nuclear age and should not have been used to justify the imperial presidency.[24]
