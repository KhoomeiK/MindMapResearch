Notes: Achieved in a single try. I've passed the 1 million point mark with a Groudon + Silvally team, but that was exceptional variance, so I'm not submitting that one. Non-SE TC is very much viable for S rank if you don't have good Ground Forces yet.

riceuniversity,ffspr9a,t3_euzoux,1580188232.0,"Assuming that your username is accurate and that you're a hs sophomore, I think it's awesome that you're so interested in the school that you're already reviewing degree requirements. I know that can seem daunting, but the fact that you're thinking far ahead is already a good sign that you have what it takes to rise up to the challenge. Maybe you're not ready for that kind of course load today, but two years from now, who knows? Build up your study habits and work ethic gradually. Greatness doesn't happen overnight. You need to develop it like a muscle. And as others have mentioned, the degree becomes much less daunting if you can cover some of your credit requirements with AP."

True, but the term serves as a simple substitute for a drawn out explanation like ""as a player who tours the premier circuit for a competitive blah blah blah..."" Words can have connotations, not just denotations.

>I cannot recall any major top32 finishes from him lately

Ouch. Top 32, Top 8, 3rd all in a one month span last November."
todayilearned,ffihlzb,t1_ffifme3,1579974068.0,"As a professional gamer I find your comment such a gem. Each and every time the format shifts, the player base thinks only about the immediate changes in a vacuum. People just can't see ahead."
yugioh,ff4146h,t3_ercgfh,1579553261.0,"The lack of digitization bothers me too, but it's important not to mix up issues. Paper match results and pairings are never the bottleneck responsible for events going longer than expected. This past season, it has primarily been the interaction between EoM procedures and player disputes (often involving Kaina) that has led to lengthy investigations that cause rounds to run over time. I judged or played in every premier in North and South America this past season except Medellin and this was consistently the root cause."
AskReddit,fed04cj,t1_fecjrmj,1578992018.0,"I know plenty of other posters have given sufficient response to this, but I'll chime in since this is actually my situation. There is most definitely a career for MDs who haven't done residency. I dropped out of med school very early, no MD awarded, and my career trajectory has been so good it sounds like a story I pulled out of my ass. I started to out out-earn my MD peers from the same class in no time. I can only imagine what else I could have done with an MD. It's about how much grit you have, and less about your degree (though it still matters)."

MBA,fdky5zx,t3_elvpgg,1578513579.0,Haha reminds me of when I was admitted to Rice. I threw together an incomplete application the day it was due and submitted it. They didn't seem to mind.

riceuniversity,fdd9wa0,t3_ekrac1,1578301680.0,"Hi, I am a graduated Rice transfer, and I frequently advise prospective transfers. From what you have shared, my assessment is that your chances are close to zero. Your test score is very low and will not be overlooked. Furthermore, from what data I could dig up, it's looking like Rice admits an average of between 0 and 1 transfer student from Canada each year. I know this is very blunt, but I am communicating this so that you can make a sober and informed decision about how you plan your transfer strategy. That is, make sure you apply to safety schools that aren't exactly the dream, but also won't be as miserable an environment as Toronto has been for you.

I recommend that you read some comments I wrote in two other threads. In this [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/riceuniversity/comments/egl436/transferring_to_rice/) example, the candidate is someone I believe has a strong chance of being accepted as a transfer. In this [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/riceuniversity/comments/efsphx/low_sat_scores_but_a_lot_to_compensate_for_rice/) example, I offer detailed commentary to a student with a similar situation as yourself. During this anxious time, please try to remember this broader perspective: whether or not you end up at your dream school or safety school, your day-to-day actions, moreso than any other factors like luck or environment, will determine whether or not you ""make it"" (however you want to define that for yourself) and can find contentment. Whether you think you can or think you can't...you're right."
riceuniversity,fdcicx8,t1_fdcghmo,1578275639.0,"That's a great insight to be aware of. The takeaway from this piece is to take better digital notes when typing or to take digital notes with a stylus, not to switch from digital to manual."
yugioh,fd6nd3g,t3_ek3tg2,1578193409.0,"I've always enjoyed the rarity aspect of Yugioh for the way it adds a secondary game to the actual game played across a table. On top of practicing for a tournament, I have the additional more long-term journey of hunting for the highest rarity (French) version of all my cards. It's kind of like how you both battle with your Pokemon, but also fill out your Pokedex at the same time. And having a limited release card is the best feeling. To have something that no one else in the world has really feels like you own a piece of Yugioh history."
riceuniversity,fd6lph4,t3_ek5qsl,1578192833.0,"I'm pretty sure I'm on the older side of Rice alum in this community, but wow these responses make me feel like everyone else is a dinosaur. If you prefer to physically write/draw your notes over typing them (this is especially relevant for classes that already provide you typed notes and you just need to add a few details onto them rather than start from scratch), then you should be doing so digitally. Apart from subjective psychological comfort, there is no tangible benefit to doing this on pen/paper over doing it digitally. Anything you can do with paper, you can do more quickly and with greater capability on a screen using a stylus. Every major computer brand has machines with this option now. I personally enjoy Dell's XPS line, which I used as a bio+psyc major, in med school, and beyond.

The reasoning that someone raised to use paper to avoid distraction is ridiculous. So what are you going to do, apply that to every other part of your life? Are you going to only recruit for jobs that don't use computers? If distraction is a problem, then work on self mastery; don't do your work in a backwards fashion to accommodate a bad habit. The other argument that someone else raised about what ""most people"" do is equally ridiculous. Most people do most things incorrectly. Instead of going with the majority, ask yourself what makes actual sense."

I've been browsing frisson for 2 years and would like to suggest a rule for this sub to limit music posts. For instance, only on certain days, or only allowed within a special thread for music. Too many people come to r/frisson just to promote content and it's detracted from the quality of this sub for quite some time."
