BorderlinePDisorder,ffbboji,t1_ffazbme,1579758744.0,How not?
BorderlinePDisorder,ffas0lq,t3_ese1x5,1579743135.0,"I appreciate that you took the time to be so thoughtful on my post and that you also care about how u may come off even if those weren't your intentions. Thank you! Also, you are right,  there are times when I've thought something happened in real life or someone said something to me and it was never the case. Like a song said,  sometimes it's hard to face reality. And that is so true but it's something we have to conquer even though its scary and that's something that I have to work on. That's for the advice :)"

BorderlinePDisorder,ffanu2i,t1_ffabsfw,1579740325.0,"I see what you're saying. I thought disassociation was more of an acting out of body experience, like if your not here. Like when people do certain drugs like Angel dust. I'm not sure sitting in a room daydreaming would classify in that realm."
DoesAnybodyElse,ff9pzsf,t3_esd2u0,1579718381.0,Sounds more like psychopathic tendencies.

NoStupidQuestions,fdg3rr1,t1_fdg3mbm,1578378907.0,"I have not known them for several years. Please don't make assumptions off my post. I've met these people through co-workers. And yes I mentioned undocumented because I didn't want to say, illegal, and thought that may have a reason in them not learning English quicker than someone from Vietnam or Germany."
NoStupidQuestions,fcsuiaj,t1_fcsubsi,1577925438.0,"That is true. Basically If I just stay on my time and punctuality,  they will have nothing to ""build"" on me."
NoStupidQuestions,fcsod95,t1_fcso4ph,1577921026.0,"Yes,  I have improved on my time management. That's what my pip was for."
NoStupidQuestions,fcsmwal,t1_fcsmfbn,1577919977.0,Well I am a good worker and I know my job but I was on a pip for my time/absence. I believe the comment was made from me being on a 90 day pip and her trying to get me out in that allotted time-frame but that failed. I honestly don't want to work for that company anymore. And I am currently seeking employment elsewhere. The only reason why I was considering telling someone was because that information was supposed to be confidential and the admin blabbed it to some co-workers at a party. Can't someone get in trouble for that?
