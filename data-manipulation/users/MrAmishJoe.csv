New construction teaches you the right way to do new plumbing.  Teaches you material and types of connections.  But when it comes to service there is no book on this stuff.

atheism,fegdptj,t1_fegd1lo,1579089077.0,"I've already said I stand by the statement.  If you felt you've trumped me by catching me in some kind of hypocrisy I'll give you that point.  I am a human being which means to one extent or another I am guilty of hypocrisy.  Is this one of those moments?  Perhaps.  I will also admit that I am jaded by many in the atheist community who use atheism to bash others in the exact same way some christians use their faith in order to bash others.  I wish both would of these sub groups would show just a little more humanity in dealing with others.  I've joined 'atheist' and 'free thinkers' groups in the past hoping to find others who wanted to be able to discuss intelligently like minded things.  To develop relationships with people of a similar view point.  What I found entirely to often were people who used atheism as an excuse for treating a large portion of the planet badly...with hate...with disgust.  Basically the same behavior they accuse christians of when dealing with non believers.  That was the root of my mocking comment.  I don't need to circle jerk atheism in order to feel superior.  

Now listen.  None of what I described may describe you...but you have claimed that attacking others and their beliefs is a strategy you defend.  That's fine man.  That's on you.  I see no reason to be your enemy.  I've said what I've said.  I'll move on with my day.  I have no doubt you could play semantics to pick apart any sentence I say.  Anything can be picked apart and you may very well be a shit ton better at any verbal sparring than I am.  

So...we may have slightly differing opinions.  I also think you probably know of the kind of people and the attitude that I'm speaking of overall.  Maybe my comment was misplaced over all.

Who use a non belief in god as reason to attack fellow humans in the exact same manner as some christians who use a belief in god to attack 'non believers'.  That's the behavior I have issue with.

That's all I'm making a statement on.  Sources here have confirmed that people die in Iranian protests, etc...  I'm not arguing that. I'm learning from that.  We grow up hearing fucked up shit about a lot of countries...only to grow up and learn a lot of it wasn't true...that the truth is we were meddling with CIA int heir countries...hostile coups we financed...etc.. and then after the fact...when we screwed it all up.  We spend the next several decades just talking about how horrible they were...all the while looking for a new reason to get our claws on the region....   So...I sometimes do get a little...crosseyed when I see the typical ""iran bad"" statement.  Not saying it can't be 100% true...just explaining my natural skeptism at this point.  No my skepticism doesn't overall sourced proof.  I'm not that big of a fool."
worldnews,fdyt3cr,t1_fdysgtm,1578783329.0,Yo comprendo.  I'm just one of the guys who think they're all pretty much members of the same club.  And I'm not always sure how by any outlier they get pretty much step right in line pretty soon after getting into congress/whatever.  That's pretty much what I mean by that.  There are very true 'outsiders' that get involved in that level.   But yes...I do know the basics of American civics.  I just maybe think of the way they work slightly different than you.

Atleast we do have the perception of choice and I do recognize the importance of that...in legitamizing a rule we actually have no say over.
Delaware,fdypdv4,t3_eneg1p,1578782193.0,1st world problems.  The people in my stores where I can easily go and buy an product made anywhere in the known world....stock their shelves a little too often for my preference.  I sometimes have to pick up my head from my phone while shopping to avoid them.  I once spilled my starbucks when I didn't look up in time and bumped into one.  He was very apologetic...but how dare he stand where I may need to walk in the future and expect me to look where I'm going.  Their stock was only half down...why are they stocking it already?  Can't they wait until they're all the way out...so they can deal with my complaints about that now.
worldnews,fdyn611,t1_fdylvgm,1578781591.0,*shrug*  That's exactly how Americans have been taught to view almost every country is my point.  My downvotes and other corrects have 'scolded' me in the right direction though.  I am not an Iranian expert just a guy simply stating he doesn't always know what to believe anymore because he's learned everyone has an agenda and will lie to you.  It'll be ok bud but I'm sure they appreciate your passionate support.
worldnews,fdyj04t,t1_fdyicjx,1578780285.0,I mean...kinda.  I think internally Iran isn't half as bad as our media portrays it.  I mean...that's propaganda at it's best man.  Americans feel as if we're the only ones in the world with...technology...advanced civilization...any rights whatsoever.  I'm not saying Iranian protestors aren't treated unfairly...  But I'm just saying...I'm not sure what to believe about that.  Because the American propaganda machine has been at work over Iran since the 1970s...and even then we don't really have all that many bad things to say about them...
worldnews,fdygx2n,t1_fdy96i7,1578779636.0,As a comparison  the US has a few thousand protesters for one reason or another several times a year.  Would you say we should worry about forced regime change?

Nothing about the other guys post made that world unrealistic."
scifi,fdxk6xa,t1_fdxjdax,1578769541.0,"Fair enough.  I just went with that price range because I'm fucking shocked how many people can afford a 70,000 vehicle in some places...but I imagine in some countries that would be 75 lifetimes of pay.  Or whatever.  I live in the south where Trucks are the standard.  70,000 is run of the mill for a truck...and EVERYONE has one.  I mean...I could afford one technically.  But I like blowing my money on instant gratification to much."
scifi,fdxfviu,t1_fdx3vvt,1578768339.0,"Let's do a comparison.  Ships with 70,000$ vehicles.  Shitty backwater 'planets' with economically depressed countries.  You go to one of the richest countries...America for example.  There are 70'000 vehicles in my neighborhood.  I can't afford one...but if a retired army sergeant was smart with his money there's no reason he couldn't.  I can drive down the road for 5 minutes and see a dozen...or more.    


But if you go to a very economically depressed country (I will not give an example for that...use imagination).  These vehicles exist in these countries.  But it's only a few of the elite that own them.  Most of the common people won't come across them.  They may even live in areas where there aren't roads.  


So....by what you say...the real world also makes no sense.  


Which...  I buy.  It doesn't really."

Saints,fdp928j,t1_fdp8dy7,1578622856.0,The topic is specifically about fans who want to get rid of Drew Brees.  When you want to get rid of the best player we've ever had while he's still playing his best (by rating) football because you lost a game...  That's spoiled behavior.  I take losses tough especially when I have expectations.....that's not generally spoiled behavior...that's just being a fan.  But yes...being in the hunt of things every year for over a decade has spoiled us compared to what came before.

Yes...just a reminder to those that want to dump Drew Brees....  


Before brees we were a team for 35 years before we had a playoff win.  Stop and let that sink in people.  


And making the playoffs?  we went on a 20+ year drought?  


We are spoiled and these 'new' fans need to stop.  Drew can play as long as he wants."
