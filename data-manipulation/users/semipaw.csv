fatlogic,ff63rlf,t1_ff61cge,1579618400.0,"The “systemic problem” you speak of is indeed the lack of discipline.  Both poverty and obesity are results of lack of discipline.  At the core, poverty and obesity are personal, individual problems that must be dealt with personally.  True change, lasting change, comes from within; such problems will never be adequately addressed by a society or a government—they are challenges that the individual must meet within the core of their being and then manifest into their own worldly experience."
fatlogic,ff5ywzz,t1_ff5yedr,1579614693.0,"I don’t even buy that it’s a half truth. While there is a correlation between poverty and obesity, it’s not the poverty that is causing the obesity.  Throughout all of human history, poverty meant malnourished and skinny.

The poor obese could both save money and cure their obesity by eating less. Eat the same exact foods that they currently do (McDonalds, processed junk, soda, whatever...) but just cut their consumption by 40%. No other change required. Over time they would lose weight and have 40% of their food budget to put in savings to reduce the burden of poverty. It’s a simple formula that would work 100% of the time if it was 100% followed. 

It’s not the poverty that is causing obesity. It’s the lack of self discipline that is causing both.

And this is coming from somebody who was once obese and who comes from the poor side of the tracks."

Yes, when you lose weight you will have to forever alter the way you eat if you want to keep the weight off. Don’t eat 3,500 calories a day. Don’t sit down at a buffet and polish off four plates. Don’t drink a 32 oz coke everyday. Easy on the Starbucks. Have one donut instead of three. Maybe try a salad with no dressing. 

Wake up every morning and take a walk. Become a runner. Become an ultra-runner. Discover a love for hiking or backpacking. Buy a bicycle and discover all the cool spots in your area via long bike trips.

The awareness that you are is the only awareness. There is no “objective reality” out there that awareness exists “within”. No the illusory world that awareness navigates is not a real place; rather, awareness resides eternally within itself, and all that is experienced is simply awareness being aware of itself. 

Occasionally it/we abide as an apparent separate self within an illusory world. Occasionally we abide as still awareness simply knowing/being aware of itself.  This awareness is always present. It does not cease or “die”. It never began.  It is simply an ever present, dimensionless awareness  dreaming up this reality."

You CAN do anything. This is your one life. The harder, the more difficult, the greater the feeling of accomplishment.

Why would a “good” and moral creator God simulate beings with incomplete knowledge and understanding of reality, test them for 15-100 years, then if they fail, allow them to be eternally tormented in a simulated hell?  That kind of a being sounds sadistic and horrible. Why not, instead of allowing them to be tormented, annihilate such souls?  Why allow an eternal torment?  It does not sound like a loving creator. Sounds like some horrible entity. 

You are the creator God, except you’re playing a game pretending you are not. There are no other “souls” out there. It’s just you, eternally, imagining all this. The bad exists so it can contrast the good. The suffering exists so there can be pleasure and joy. The game of separation exists so that duality can manifest this reality."
SimulationTheory,fcvg88z,t1_fcvfak0,1578001443.0,"But even if this “heaven” and “hell” exist, they do so as part of the base reality. At the most fundamental/grandest of all realities, there can only be one thing. You, I, heaven, hell, any creator God and every possible apparent thing In existence are an illusion within the undivided whole. 

There can be no true separation between a God and the creations of this God, because separation would imply there is some other reality that God and its creations can exist within separately. And if that is the case, God is not fundamental.  And thus we would have to begin looking “up” a level for what created God."
SimulationTheory,fcvegjb,t1_fcvdeez,1578000393.0,"I do subscribe to a version of simulation theory, but the base reality cannot be more than a single, indivisible “something”.  If what one considers base reality has more than one object/entities, it is not base reality, for those apparently multiple objects/entities must exist within and as a subset of a greater (more baser) reality. And thus one would have to go another level “up” to search for this baser reality.

The simpler and more obvious answer (to me) is that what we call existence is not actually multiple objects/entities existing within some objective space/time, but rather what appears as reality is the illusory division of this undivided whole.  An infinite, unborn/unending awareness. And the awareness that is you is that awareness. They are not separate."
SimulationTheory,fcvcyab,t3_eiub2z,1577999492.0,"Logically, base reality has to be a single, indivisible “something”. Base reality cannot contain anything, for that would imply a reality that the “things” are a subset of.
