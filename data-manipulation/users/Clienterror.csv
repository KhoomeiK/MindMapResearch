I was paid to infiltrate people's dreams, usually rich tycoons to get secrets on them that weren't normally accessable without extreme physical interventions. I went in with a small team of individuals, usually 3 or 4. I could never be the ""architect"" as we called it because....well let's say it just wasn't good. Eventually we became so good that were we hired to implant an idea in the person's head which requires is to go ""3 levels deep"" meaning a dream in a dream in a dream. This was previously thought to be impossible but we did pull it off. One of the members was killed in the dream so I had to go into his subconscious to retrieve his mind.

They're also rear fanged venomous snakes which is just how it reads. Their fangs are located in the back of their mouth and it's REALLY REALLY hard to get envenomated and if you do it's less than a bee sting to humans. They usually just bluff strike when they're younger and they're a little more finicky. As they get older they calm down a lot and get used to handling. 

It's a very cool snake breed with pretty beginner friendly requirements. Most people pit them just below a ball python which is the easiest snake to handle. I had a ball once who was I kid you not scared of frozen thawed mice."

Kawasaki,fdiv1ex,t3_el7nva,1578451671.0,"So here's the real deal about helmets. If they have legit certifications they're just as good as another with the same cert from a safety standpoint. A lot of people will tell you to just buy as expensive as you can afford, and it really isn't needed. What you're paying for is comfort, fit, and features not so much safety. 

That being said buy a decent lid around the $250-$350 mark and you're getting the best bang for your buck (with some research). Find one that fits your head shape (oval, intermediate, round, ect), meets whatever safety standards that are important to you, and style you prefer/activity you're using it for (cruising, track, agressive, ect)

Now I'm not saying that high end helmets aren't worth it, they are usually lighter, have more features, and more comfy (generally) but don't think if you don't spend $1,000 on a lid that it will save your life anymore than a $300 helmet.

Android,fcvz9yv,t1_fcvxnfa,1578013508.0,"It doesn't calculate it based on 1 to 100. It bases it off what percent your phone reports to it and how much capacity it's designed to have. So say your phone is 4,000mah capacity then every percent is technically 40mah. So when you let it discharge say it only calculates 36mah per percent well your battery capacity is at 3,600mah so you have 10% wear it 90% health. 

The problem with AccuBattery is it can only go off what it's told from the system, and the system isn't linear what so ever. If you've ever watched a battery run down test on YouTube you'll notice the iPhone will be at like 100% after 45 minutes while the other phones are at 90% (or whatever percent respectively). The iPhone really isn't at 100%, they just programmed it so that it displays 100% longer so you feel like it gets great battery even though it isn't any better than anything else probably. And that Android phone will take FOREVER to go from 5% to 0%, same thing. 

If there's an actual system level setting it gets the RAW data from the phone theoretically and can give you it's actual capacity, not what it's reporting too AccuBattery which is probably bullshit.
