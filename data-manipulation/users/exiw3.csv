AskReddit,ffj5jhv,t1_ffj2hwk,1579990938.0,"I personally explain this to myself as a way our brains shortcut our thoughts and try to end it all without thinking again. I didn't kill ms once because i just thinked about it too much. But then i often feel overwhelmed by my own mind and it is possible that i will ""shortcut"" again. Then our minds are not invincible, and that is pretty much the short answer.
Again, we could go forward to this argument forever, but those are just speculations that i am making.

Thanks for the description, i'll read some thoughts of her!"
AskReddit,ffj1ymb,t1_ffj0r05,1579988359.0,"Yes but I think we know how happiness and good emotions feel, so we pursue them unintentionally hoping things will get better (even if we think they don't, but our brain is made to think like that to survive) , and we don't want to go in the ""black"" (death) where the nothingness awaits us.
Then even surviving is basic istinct, so I think that's it.

Please note is only my opinion and I don't take these things for absolute granted over other lines of thinking. 

Btw i never readed his books, what are they about?"
depression,ffj0be0,t1_ffi410c,1579987167.0,"IQ is really only about logical thinking. The fact that you have a high emotional intelligence is a sign that you are not stupid. Then it could be a million things that causes people not being able to learn so much.
Maybe you are more of a wise than a smart one."
AskReddit,ffiyz8p,t1_ffivw2g,1579986189.0,"I think it doesn't work like that. On a greater scale, all things are casual and don't have a ""purpose"" to fulfill. Like a nebula after a supernova, we are here only by the reactions that occur in the universe.

But we just stand here, trying to survive cause our brains don't want to feel the emotion of struggling or pain or sadness.

So that's pretty much our purpose, and that is really not a purpose when you think about it. it is a way to survive (and even the feeling to do good to others, it is a way to make us feel better)

Just my opinion plus some study I had done."
Fallout,ffa48mi,t1_ff9wbap,1579727568.0,I'm one of those players that just can't be evil all the time -_-
Fallout,ffa40fm,t1_ff9x698,1579727441.0,"Yes I never thinked on this perspective. One problem I always had, that also applies irl, is that I tend to see things black or white, no middle ""colors"".

But you are absolutely right, no one's a saint everyday neither an asshole, this mentality I have is just bad generalizing. 

Thanks for the good answer!"
Fallout,ffa37xi,t1_ff9kn4x,1579726988.0,"That was a feeling I had when playing FO4 survival.
Oh you said you needed help with raiders. What was that? FOR FREE??
Yeah nope."
Fallout,ffa2zbf,t1_ff9jid6,1579726850.0,"Many years ago some ""friends"" stole my bike in middle school. It's absolutely not worth a motorcycle, but you have all my support, if that feels better."
Fallout,ff9in0w,t1_ff9hrok,1579713816.0,"Well thank you for the good idea, seems like you suggested me a good way to vent my big sad.
(by the way I think i am really altruistic in rl, but often people just fuck with me so I feel this)"
Fallout,ff9i1fm,t1_ff9grdc,1579713458.0,Absolutely me. That's also why I have this indecision on morals(and I always play myself in-game).
EliteDangerous,ff46ni4,t1_ff44y6a,1579556700.0,Thanks!
EliteDangerous,ff43pfz,t3_erfrv0,1579554861.0,"I am a ps4 player in Europe, didn't play for a lot and I was thinking to rejoin.

I have seen there are problems with the new patch (can't understand if the problems regards all the platform or only pc) and I want to ask you guys if I can rejoin or I should wait more time for eventual future patches."
depression,ff3cqhe,t1_ff2ml1n,1579538542.0,"We should not have rulers at all. Spiritual leaders are all but ethic and spiritual. It's the same thing, whatever ""cause"" you ""support"" : greed for money and need for power,and it never changed."
classicfallout,ff13c4g,t3_er2yjg,1579474771.0,"Because if you manage to enter their base without being seen, they will mistakenly think of you as one of their soldiers.

But enclave patrols can't do that error even if you're wearing enclave armor, you encounter them in the wasteland.

As for the build, you're only level 8 so it's up to you what to put points on, it really depends on your playstile. For example, if you use long ranged rifles (snipers, using normal ammo) you should put points on small arms (150 is ok)

But considering you have high agility and intelligence, you can try raising energy guns (but it will take time to use them effectively)

Or you can always raise big guns, again, it's up to you.

Also in case you're not playing a specific role character, I suggest you to raise speech af!"

Fallout,fdv4k66,t1_fdshykw,1578743166.0,"You can't have all the dialogue and lore in only a walktrough (at least not easily as f3-4-NV).
It takes time to get used to it, but the way you play with your character and how you build it really changes the overall gameplay and story, so for example (i don't want to spoil) if you noticed you could enter the sewers of the city, and not talk to Set at all changing the way the story evolves. 

Also the location in f1 are not so lore detailed like the ones in the other fallout games, it's the first game and I think to remember they didn't had so much of a budget."
offmychest,fdrmj3o,t3_emtutt,1578686634.0,"Damn. This takes me back when I spent long nights with my crush texting about life, and one night we felt asleep but she woke and called me at 3 am hahah
I say go for him, I loved her and I did exactly what he did for you, I'm not assuring anything but trying is a must!"

lonely,fdmq9j4,t3_em53ob,1578560451.0,That's why I won't get a funeral.
lonely,fdhxddq,t3_elhe6z,1578431879.0,"You shouldn't care about that at all. 

Do you worry about having a relationship because you are in need for love and affection, or only for the seeking of approval from society around us, losting you virginity and showing everyone you are ""capable"" of making someone love you? 


If the second you should not care, live your life trusting yourself, not society approval, it will lead to nothing and this is a good tip for life in general. 


If the first however, I'll be realistic: It can be a lot of things. 
Maybe it is how you dress, maybe how you look, maybe how you speak, your face, your attitude, your eyes, your beard, your hair, your skin, your job, your influence around others, your social skills and life and 1000 others. 


But you're human, we're human and not machines, you HAVE to accept yourself as you are. 
Because in real life, only the one who can accept you for who your truly are can love you for real, and you can trust this person with your heart.


So, generalizing people like you under the name of ""incel"" (like any other generalization) is stupid and personally, really really sad. Please, we are beautiful in many ways and it is a waste doing that. 

Thanks for reading."
depression,fdgnl3v,t1_fdfnjt9,1578403252.0,"Exactly. Nostalgia is like a drug, it comes with sadness but you can't get enough of it, maybe we just never want to go forward."
AskReddit,fdeufps,t1_fdesxve,1578346831.0,Yes. Someone who understands this.

offmychest,fcutlui,t3_ej0vmy,1577988240.0,"Don't think this is the right subreddit to ask, but maybe you should try r/Military. Surely your situation is relatable there. 
I personally would seek help to the military psychologist. You can enjoy getting deployed but this problem can risk your life while deployed and it's better to find a solution in those 2 weeks.
Sorry for eventual errors!"

gaming,fctsebz,t1_fcsvg1h,1577957039.0,Why?
gaming,fcsqdb0,t1_fcspnqh,1577922449.0,It is more like help someone feeling better and letting him know that there's people out there that could care if given the chance.
EliteDangerous,fc32dub,t1_fc2r48d,1577379863.0,Yep I was saying the overall game not the OG elite on the wall but thanks anyway
