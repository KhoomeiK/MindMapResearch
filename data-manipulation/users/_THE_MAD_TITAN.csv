That would be naive to assume such individuals aren't already with Warren or Pete or Biden. And if Sanders wins the first races, they would probably drop some of their reservations about Sanders and get on board. It would take quite the stubborn commitment to preserving a moderate status quo to resist the agglomeration of support behind a winning candidate they don't agree with completely.

>I'm not here to argue. At the end of the day, at the end of the 2016 primary campaign more people voted for Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and not an insignificant number of people. They do so after Hillary was trounced in New Hampshire and Bernie went blow-for-blow in Iowa. It neuters the idea that just because Warren might be third fiddle in IA/NH that her campaign is done

I mean, it really does though.

You have not been paying attention to how these campaigns are structured and funded.

Warren doesn't have the long-established machine around her that either Biden or the Clinton campaign did. She would dwindle out of contention fairly rapidly if she can't score a narrative-shifting victory in either of the first three states. She doesn't poll very well in SC either.

You're relying way too much on rehashing 2016 to make assertions about 2020. That's not smart. Not at all.

>Considering Warren is still second in the campaign finance race (money raised, money on hand) from any source I can find and Biden's totals have been marginal at best it would appear the most likely player to drop out is Biden.

Not really. Warren's cash inflow spigot is already being tightened. Biden is shamelessly dependent on large-dollar donors via bundlers and SuperPACs, you shouldn't be using public FEC data to compare his campaign to any other."

There will still be enough moderate candidates to splinter the non-Bernie part of the tent. The question is whether Sanders can eke out a narrow majority of delegates (very unlikely), or will have to deal with a brokered convention.

>Because ultimately Bernie Sanders earned more individuals votes in the 2016 caucuses after trouncing Hillary in New Hampshire by 26% points and being even with her in Iowa, right? He won by 12% and 3.7m votes, right?

>>I don't think either one of us cares to rehash 2016 and the systemic issues

So, which is it? Because you just ""rehashed"" part of 2016 to make a point that is fundamentally flawed in the premise.

The voters will go to a whole spread of candidates, but Sanders is looking poised to be the frontrunner throughout the primary. The unresolved question is whether he can gather a clear majority. It's certainly possible if Biden and Pete bow out, and leave precious little time for Warren/Amy/Bloomberg to pick up the Biden refugees.

Remember, of all the moderate candidates, ***only Biden*** polls better than Sanders with voters of color in the southern states, and Super Tuesday has quite a few of them.

They didn't consider that they would likely later decide to support the winner of the early states, a well documented phenomenon known as the bandwagon effect. 

I don't see how Warren recovers. If Bernie pulls a win, she loses that progressive lane forever, and the moderates will probably stay in the race to collect former Biden supporters and try to keep Bernie from winning an outright majority. Pete could forseeably withdraw, but his supporters are more likely to fall in a Bloomberg or Klobuchar camp if they weren't already in the Warren camp, since clearly such folks define themselves as being moderates and Warren hasn't really built up a reputation for being a staunch moderate like Amy (and to a lesser extent, Bloomberg) has."

Your nightmare scenario, the very basis of your opinion, is already accounted for and discredited.

Next?"

I wish my republican friends and relatives would be able to develop emotional relationships, other than their loyalty to the ""orange man"" they chose to worship.

Trump smashes Bernie, Bernie obliterates Trump, Trump gangs up with Klobuchar to torch Steyer, Bloomberg caught in a love triangle with Steve Bannon and Chelsea Clinton, etc...

Headlines merely existing is absolutely meaningless."

PresidentialRaceMemes,ffx53mg,t1_ffw1eco,1580317932.0,Prob bc Yang's unviable in Iowa and they need that sweet 4-5% boost in case bloomberg and petes' supporters join with biden to form some boomer megazord.

It all starts with that [first step into the abyss](https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/b/5/b5a58666-0af0-495d-bc30-aff96e6ca7f6/24AFD6AB7A182F6330FC1AC3E5A42253.internshipapplication1.pdf)"
politics,ffx4e6s,t1_ffx0wvz,1580317504.0,"My understanding is that Warren's camp has/had 2-3 factions within it. 

Much of the economic progressive part of her base has been shifting to Sanders. What's left is largely ""madam president"" crusaders and those who were hoping to build a retirement nestegg on the value of their selfies with Warren (that last one is obvious /s)"
politics,ffx029i,t1_ffwz3ca,1580314847.0,"He's only slightly behind in the new Monmouth polling. But there's still an upward momentum for Bernie.

I'm also hearing and reading that the Biden-leading polls are *potentially* undersampling youth turnout, which is inconsistent with Tuft's forecast of historic youth turnout this year. 

Take everything with a few grains of salt, but it's still a fairly good situation for Sanders. The only real concern is the impact of non-viable centrist candidates and how much of a net boost that gives Biden when there's a situation where only 3 candidates will be over the 15% viability threshold. Do Pete supporters join the Warren camp? Will it be Amy/Pete/Warren/Bloomberg people all just making a beeline to the Biden crowd out of concerns of Bernie's electability?

Who really knows. There's a *lot* of unresolved risk for unanticipated upset by the Biden campaign."
politics,ffwz05q,t1_ffwvu0m,1580314183.0,"IMO (okay, I'm plagiarizing from another comment here) is that the Warren/Sanders debate spat has aroused some resentment toward Bernie."

politics,ffwv1b7,t1_ffwti92,1580311655.0,"It's easy to ""compromise"" with the other side when:

1. The ""other side"" are, for the most part, on the same side as you in a lot of policy areas, and:

2. Your ""consensus"" just so happens to be one that satisfies the moneyed lobbyists' concerns *at the expense* of the actual voting public.

The ""consensus"" isn't a goal that is only achieved by ""moderates"", the consensus is a narrow range of ideology in itself, and the two parties just have to find clever ways to stay in bounds of that range while pretending they are sticking it to the other side. The differences are actually less clear between parties as one moves up from local to state to federal policymaking.

Focus on the social class structure, not the window dressing differences on social and cultural issues."
politics,ffwuu7v,t3_evns96,1580311527.0,"200% agree.

I've not yet seen Bernie rough up and condescend to his rally guests the way Biden does. 

How are we supposed to just.... expect Bernie to stand up to Putin or Xi, when he won't even muster the courage to call his own supporters ""fat"" or make insecure challenges to push-up duels?

This is the singular reason why I am no longer supporting Bernie. Biden 2020."
