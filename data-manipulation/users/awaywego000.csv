52weeksofcooking,ffu3xw4,t3_ev1fd1,1580233967.0,I have made yogurt for years. The milk needs to be heated to about 200f for at least 10 minutes. Let it cool to about body temp (I don't use a thermometer) and put in the starter and keep it at that temp. Any yogurt that says on the label that is has live and active cultures will work for a starter. I use Walmart brand plain. After the starter is added it may take 8-10 hours. I use a method that requires no clean up except for the container used after I eat it. I let it work overnight so it is ready when I get up next morning. It will keep refrigerated.

I can put it in the oven at 225 for an hour and let it cool down to about body temp.
