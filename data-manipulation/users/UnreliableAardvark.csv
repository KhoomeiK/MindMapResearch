conspiracy,ffvck4c,t1_ffvb1lc,1580260925.0,"Thats the thing though... they're *kids*. We don't hold them as accountable because it's pretty much universally agreed (just not as to *when*) that our brains dont stop developing until sometime late teens to mid 20s, with some recent chatter about as late as early 30s. By that, we dont allow them to contract with others, nor to participate in certain activities deemed inherently dangerous because they, by our own societal agreement,  cannot understand the inherent risks associated with the activity, so until such time as they are deemed adults/of age, they generally dont participate.

To say that a kid not being sure about who they are is perfectly fine. I mean, we all go through figuring out who we are. But to say that they should be allowed to engage in an inherently risky endeavor with a lifetime commitment behind it no less, or that parents should make such life/self altering decisions is a whole 'nother ballgame. If parents are allowed to make that kind of decision for their child, why then should they not also be the ones to ultimately decide on the other already established practices of society?"
