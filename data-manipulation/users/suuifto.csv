Some of the non-flagship galaxy phones, like the A50 have no water resistance."

FallenOrder,fd0zkwg,t1_fd0z6ac,1578125917.0,Ohhhh okay I appreciate the clarification. The rest of the plot I was fine with but that was just the one part I was fuzzy on. Thanks again for your help
FallenOrder,fd0yjb4,t1_fd0xwei,1578125503.0,"Ohhh okay that makes sense. In terms of the relationship between Eno and bd1 beforehand, in the holograms is he talking to the player(cal) through the droid or is he talking to bd1 and cal is simply watching bd play back the shows of his old friend to teach cal stuff. I never understood why if eno had discovered all of these things all this time ago why certain things weren’t done sooner?"
