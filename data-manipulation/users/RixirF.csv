But I made a terrible mistake a few years ago when I was out running, my upper outer knee started to hurt, and I decided to run through it. Well a few km later and I felt this awful pain and heat, and couldn't bend my leg anymore.

From there, it was about 2 months before I could even jog. Otherwise I'd feel the same pain and heat on my knee if I even tried to jog slightly. 4 months later I was able to get back and actually run. It was awful and it taught me that at least for me it's not the way to go. I lost so much time getting back from that injury that it didn't make sense to run through things like that again."

It can be an insignificant odd feeling in my knee that by mile 4 has now turned into something annoying that makes me stop before I injure myself. Or something in my hip, or my heel, or my IT band. Or now it's the other leg. 

It's always some bullshit and I dont even know how to prevent it because it's just a damn Russian roulette of stupid little annoyances that I know will turn into full blown injuries if I run though it.
