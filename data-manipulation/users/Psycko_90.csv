People would literally rather buy drugs and essentially kill themselves than be responsible.  

I'm serious here... If your going to call this shit ""education"", I won't debate with you. 

This is not ""education"" it's sensationalism and fear mongering bullshit. Education is not a publicity campain against drugs. Education is how and why people have done drugs since the dawn of time. Why it can be potentialy dangerous, how to use them safely, where to get ressources for help, what to expect with the different drugs. Education is the elevation of the mind. Not the control of it.  Building  critical thinking and teaching people to think by themselves, not following what we tell you is good or bad.


>Or what about all the studies that show areas that teach abstinence only sex education have higher rates of teenage pregnancy than areas that teach about contraceptives and safe sex practices.  Again, an example of being educated to ""don't do this"" fails miserably at preventing the one thing it was designed to stop.

Again, I'm trying to be serious here. Just stop already with those exemple that just confirm my point.

>What possible education can be provided to the masses that would change behavior in any meaningful way to affect the environment on a global scale?  

Critical thinking.

>The only thing we can do as a public is elect officials that will stand up to corporate interests and demand change.  Seeing the people being elected to office around the globe, it's looking increasingly likely that this will never happen. 

I agree with you here. But the way to get sensible officials and to elect them, is to educate our youth to think by themselves and stop following the media. 

As I said, we won't change shit in a generation. We need a couple generation to be able to see those change.

They were cutting the Rainforest for trees before. Since it's illegal to do so, now they are using it for pasture (not crop) to raise beef and sell it to the US. 

Taxation and control will not solve the problem, because the problen comes from those who vote laws and apply taxations.

todayilearned,ff6vhki,t1_ff6ufy1,1579635724.0,"I don't follow a lot of people on YouTube and I rarely use it. 

I watch mostly things that are not ""politicaly correct"" like science stuff and gun stuff. They are often demonetized when they show how to make certain experiment or show reactions from some other because ""omg terrorists and bombs and kills"" 

I tend to avoid YouTube as a whole because I hate the algorithm that keep you braindead and keep showing you the same stuff again and again. 

So for the 3 youtubers that I really like, yes, I pay for their patreons. 

I don't care what the others are doing. I prefer to give 5$ a month that goes to a youtuber I like, instead of watching fuck tons of ads every 5 minutes and a stupid bar that block 1/4 of the videos. Also, I've seen youtubers doing ads themselves within the video content, which is imo way better. 

As for the internet as a whole, yes, I use Ublock because ads are insufferable. Pop up that block the browsers, alarmingly loud sounds, stupid videos that won't stop or pages which 80% of the content is ads. 

Fuck it.

EDIT: I have to add that I also pay for my data on my phone. Watching a 1minutes ad for a 3minute video and using 33% more data just for an ad? No thanks."

On my paycheck, I pay almost 40% of deduction on my salary but it's mostly from insurances, unions, parental leaves for others (it's not included in the taxes on my pay check), my retirement funds etc. But it's not only taxes."

I vote with my wallet. 

But that's my choice and it makes groceries pricier, but as a single person it's not that bad. If I had to feed a familly, my ""responsible groceries"" would be out of the game. I'll go walmart and costco and buy a truck load of cheap stuff."
canada,ff6aj5y,t1_ff66xv5,1579622943.0,"As a single adult, it doesn't change the fact that all of this money is out of my pocket. 

I never said it was bad. It's just that this money leave my pocket and I don't use any of those services but for hospital maybe once every 5 years if I injure myself, but we live in a society and I do my part. 

The guy says ""who pays 40% taxes"" like it's something rare. 

Well, it's not. I have pretty middle range salary and I pay almost 40%. It is simplistic yes, my goal wasn't to make a dissertation about taxes. I just said what I pay. That's a fact. Nothing else.

That was my only point, I didn't complain a single bit so I don't understand the relevance of your comment."

bodyweightfitness,ff5zak4,t1_ff5ybiy,1579614996.0,"That's enough. 

Personaly I also do front squat and deadlift because both are great exercices for core strength and a somewhat full body exercice.
 
I also finish every climbing session with a bit of core exercices."
bodyweightfitness,ff5yzhb,t3_erpqym,1579614748.0,I suggest you to go take a look on /r/climbharder
bodyweightfitness,ff5yvu5,t1_ff5fbut,1579614666.0,"Yes and no. 

You need to work antagonists muscles, core and legs.

Once you reach a certain level in climbing (around V4 and more), you'll need pretty solid leg strength. At least enough to do a couple pistol squats. 

Core workout is not mandatory if you're beginner, climbing will work your core a lot. 

Antagonist muscles are important for balance and injury prevention.

I'll suggest that you do a quick 20min routine as a warm up including push-ups and squat or a single leg exercices. 

It's not enough to burn your energy before climbing and will a least work the whole body including climbing."

canada,ff3qm44,t1_ff3mmnx,1579546737.0,"The fact that it's possible is enough. Who cares if it's unlikely. If it happens, a juge will rule depending on the circumstances. 

If you really have any knowledge with law, you'd know that it is well within criminal negligence margin.

You can act like a smartass all you want. You should be held responsible for giving a loaded gun to a suicidal person or giving drugs to an addict. Same things with banks loaning money to people who can't pay back. 

I'm not defending those idiots who can't manage their own fucking pay. But saying that the bank don't have any part of the blame is utterly stupid. 

If the economy crash and I lose money, it's not only because of those who filed for bankruptcy, but also the banks who keep loaning money to these people, just to feed of the interests and slowly killing the economy. 

I'd add that they not only do that with people, but also with businesses and even countries. So you could blame the poor dumbass without a highschool degree because of his poor judgement and bad education, but in the meantime, the banks will keep loaning him money knowing that he can't repay them."

I mean, if you go out there selling crack. You are responsible of fuelling the crack addict. 

Same things with banks and loan. Some people have a hard time managing their money. Before easy loan and credit, no money = nothing. Now, banks will tell you you're richer than you think and lend you too much money and feed of the interests they charge you."
