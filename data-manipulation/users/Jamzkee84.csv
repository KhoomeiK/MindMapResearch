True odds are $1.50 per $1."
Craps,ffatbkd,t1_ffarurg,1579744005.0,"I’m not sure where you got you math. $24 is an incorrect bet. I suppose you could place it, but even then $20 would pay $28. The additional $4 would technically pay $5.60, but would be rounded down to $5 dollars on a nine or 5 place bet.  $28 + 5 is 33.
