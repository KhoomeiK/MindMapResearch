We buy the battery at auto zone. We can't get the old battery out. My step dad runs a auto dealership, (but he lives two hours away) I call him, he looks up our vehicle in the system. Says it recommended an hour labor?! Wtf. To remove a fucking car battery. We watched and read multiple videos and articles on the internet on how to remove this battery, but the battery still won't budge. Auto Zone won't help us. It's in their system that they literally can't touch BMWs. 

 I end up making a post on reddit, and turns out there is a bolt hidden under the heat shield that we have to remove to get the battery out. Finally get this bolt out, it was a pain in the fucking ass to get the battery back in. You have you line up all these hard to reach tabs, tighteners, and bolts, and you think you have it in and you put everything back together, and the heat shield cover won't go on all the way, so you have to remove it all again. It took us like 3 hours to replace a fucking battery. With multiple different people coming over to help us. People who work on cars. So its not like we're just two dumb asses. We almost had it towed to Mini because we couldn't get the damn battery back in right. But finally got the pos back together. 

I had to change the battery on my Chrysler a few months later. Took me 2 minutes. Tops.

I find it very unlikely that this is all of the story. Petsmart Corp does not fuck around. Did a store manager do this in retaliation? I would call HR and I guarantee they would fire him immediately. Otherwise, I would say there's more to the story, probably drama in the salon that people are sick of dealing with (number one issue of working in a salon. So much drama.) 

They have also installed cameras in all of the salons within the last year because they are cracking down on neglect and abuse on the salons. They are zero tolerance for any abuse whatsoever. They would have this all on camera. 

And to the comments saying they don't employ real Groomers, there is no regulation of dog groomers. ANYONE can pick up a pair of clippers and call themselves a groomer, even at a private shop. 
Petsmart groomers have to go to ""Grooming academy"" for a month and then groom something like 100 dogs (I don't remember exactly how many dogs) until they are considered fully trained.
Now the quality of their training varies GREATLY, and I definitely agree they promote a lot of bathers to groomers that IMO should never have been promoted, but this is going to vary greatly by store, just like it would at any private salon. We had plenty of quality groomers while I worked there. I was trained by a woman who was not trained by petsmart, and who had been grooming for over 20 years. 

You know why so many GOOD groomers work for Petsmart? Health insurance and guaranteed hours and vacation/sick pay. Something a lot of private shops can't offer. I was getting 4 weeks of vacation a year. 

If you want a to find a quality groomer, find one who has been grooming for over 5 years, has photos of their grooms, and talk to them. You can't clump all the groomers together over ones action. It's not fair to the thousands of groomers who work there."

Look at these dogs, top dogs in the world, and have to be corrected to NOT stand on their hocks, because they are bred with such over exaggerated angulation. 
If you stood next to these dogs and pushed them they would have to flail around to not fall over.

My dad used to have Snap-on everything, and collected tools for 20 years. Then they lost everything in a fire, and he'll only buy Harbor Freight now. He says he doesn't notice a difference, but I think losing all his nice tools burned him somehow."

But all these breeds could be fixed if breeders would pull their heads out of their asses and breed for healthier dogs."

Frugal,fdb4o7r,t3_ekf4ws,1578253768.0,"I bought a bread maker for this exact same reason.
But the bread wouldn't last longer than 3 days before it starts to mold and I was throwing out half of it. The $3/loaf is worth it to me to have the bread last over a week. And I keep all our bread in the fridge to last longer.

I just use to it occasionally make garlic bread now."

dogs,fcxjjfq,t1_fcwjmbh,1578064494.0,"They are not dumb. They are less biddable than other dog breeds. There is a difference.

Dumb is the Frenchie I'm dog sitting that took a month to learn how to open the dog door on his own. Even with lots of treats and coaxing, and showing him he can open it with his face or his foot.
Even my other dogs are smart enough to see he's dumb and let him in.

Edit: yesterday was the first day he was using the dog door on his own. I spoke too soon, he only figured out he can open it to come inside. not to go outside..."
esist,fculj3i,t1_fcukxn2,1577983639.0,"A lot of people can't afford an ID, or the paperwork required to get one (don't have copy of their birth certificate, SS card). Or to take the time off work to get one, since the dmv is only open during normal business hours. 

Just make all these things free and I'm all for requiring photo ID.
But Republicans are against that too."

And they would prefer to deal with most of the healing. 
Backyard breeders/puppy mills don't want to deal with any of that."

dogs,fc95rrn,t3_egiu4r,1577547477.0,"I worked for Petsmart as a groomer for 10 years. 
I find it very unlikely that this is all of the story. Petsmart Corp does not fuck around. Did a store manager do this in retaliation? I would call HR and I guarantee they would fire him immediately. Otherwise, I would say there's more to the story, probably drama in the salon that people are sick of dealing with (number one issue of working in a salon. So much drama.) 

They have also installed cameras in all of the salons within the last year because they are cracking down on neglect and abuse on the salons. They are zero tolerance for any abuse whatsoever. They would have this all on camera. 

And to the comments saying they don't employ real Groomers, there is no regulation of dog groomers. ANYONE can pick up a pair of clippers and call themselves a groomer, even at a private shop. 
Petsmart groomers have to go to ""Grooming academy"" for a month and then groom something like 100 dogs (I don't remember exactly how many dogs) until they are considered fully trained.
Now the quality of their training varies GREATLY, and I definitely agree they promote a lot of bathers to groomers that IMO should never have been promoted, but this is going to vary greatly by store, just like it would at any private salon. We had plenty of quality groomers while I worked there. I was trained by a woman who was not trained by petsmart, and who had been grooming for over 20 years. 

You know why so many GOOD groomers work for Petsmart? Health insurance and guaranteed hours and vacation/sick pay. Something a lot of private shops can't offer. I was getting 4 weeks of vacation a year. 

If you want a to find a quality groomer, find one who has been grooming for over 5 years, has photos of their grooms, and talk to them. You can't clump all the groomers together over ones action. It's not fair to the thousands of groomers who work there."
