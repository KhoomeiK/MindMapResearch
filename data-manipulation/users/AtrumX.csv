There's a lot of just bad information out there. Just for reference, my wife is 5'5 and weighs around 130 and she maintains around 2400.

My advice is always the same. Weigh your food, eat the same thing every day, and for someone your size - eat 3,000 calories/day for 2 weeks. Lift hard, sleep a lot. You'll probably gain some weight. That's okay.

After 2 weeks is up (with no skipping meals or substituting foods, having weekend cheat days, etc.) adjust your calories up or down if you need to (in increments of 200-maybe 500) and then monitor over each week.

Personally, if I'm maintaining and want to lose while staying strong, adding a little cardio in tips the balance while keeping my strength up.

Over time, you'll grow into the look you're going for.

P.S. At 160, you will look tiny even if you get to very low body fat %. I'd make strength goals and work on this until you're quite a bit heavier.

P.P.S. Physically and mentally, it really sucks being stuck in low calorie land. You'll thank yourself for getting strong and gaining weight over time. As a bonus, you'll look much leaner at higher bodyfat eventually."

1 - 'toned legs' means you want to lose fat so there is more definition.

2 - 'bigger/rounder glutes' means you want to gain muscle.

Losing fat simply means eating a caloric deficit. To gain muscle, you need progressive overload. Doing at-home band only workouts can lose all the fat you want, but you'll have difficulty adding any real mass to your muscles anywhere.

Most social-media fitness people made their gains by eating a LOT of food, lifting progressively heavier weights, and then leaning out after they had built some base muscle mass. They then sell programs that are fun and easy to do anywhere, but would serve better as a warmup before lifting.

You may lose fat if you eat just right, and your legs will look more lean/toned - but you're doing things the long/difficult way by not lifting weights. 

&#x200B;

P.S. This is a simplistic overview, but covers the general points. You can gain some muscle, especially if you're a beginner - but you'll definitely hit a plateau fairly quickly.

&#x200B;

P.P.S. While it's not idea, band workouts do a great job of building smaller muscles that big lifts often ignore, and will help your baseline fitness. It definitely won't hurt anything.

Fitness,fdb8lkn,t1_fdarhu2,1578254935.0,"You probably shouldn't be lifting your 1RM with very much frequency. I can DL around 600 right now, but rarely go above doing 500ish for sets of 3-5.

IMO, ignore 405 for a while. If you can bang out 7 or 8 reps at 365 - there's no way your grip won't be able to handle 405.

Also, bodyweight hangs are great for grip strength. (as are single arm hangs). They're easy to throw in after a workout for a few sets."

No qualifying what 'doing child-care' for 8 hours a week (which is the current amount millennial fathers report spending with their children) actually is.

There are great dads out there. Are they out hiking and playing games with their kids? Maybe. They could easily be sitting on a couch swiping through IG.

I'm also a millennial father of 3 kids that spends WAY more than 8 hours weekly with mine - and anecdotally see the entire gamut of attentiveness in various events my kids go to that are around other parents.

So, I do know what I'm talking about. My joking alternate title doesn't give the same warm fuzzy feeling though - so apologies for any jimmies that were rustled."

Makes me think 405 might actually be a 2020 possibility."
