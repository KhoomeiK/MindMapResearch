Stellaris,fesbcio,t1_fers2u2,1579363464.0,"Sentient simulations with droids, though, is cool. Had a megacorp with that. One computer freaked out and killed itself because it realized that in the event of war with a neighbor, mutual annihilation was assured. Had a droid ask if robots had souls.

Moved to a house with 20 acres and have a ton of plans for it as far as working the land goes. Its going to take years to do, but i love the work, and the little bits of money it will save me here and there will stack up over the years (talkin things like chickens, a rather large garden, bees, and the like. 

I had a friend who has been criticizing me because i grabbed a factory job so that i could, you know, pay for it all. Also, i can bank some money so that i can make some investmentments.

 Apparently, what i should have done is take out a loan so that i could build the entire infrastructure for all this by next year as well as pay to live until i really make a profit. Cause that is what i really want to do. Add another 100k loan on top of the home loan that i just got. 

Ive gotten this a lot from people with the 'hustle' mentality. Im entirely tired of being told how to manage my job/money/investments by people who jump from hustle to hustle while taking out loans to buy used cars and saying ""i have a lot of irons in the fire."""

Anyway, all that aside, it wasnt difficult to follow at all if you have any sort of attention span.
