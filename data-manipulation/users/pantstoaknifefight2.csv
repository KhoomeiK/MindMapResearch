Music,ffm1mv2,t1_ffkqw8r,1580047158.0,"I saw Prince live once, maybe 18 yrs ago. I've seen so many great shows, so many insanely talented people, including Floyd, Tom Petty, Radiohead, The Mars Volta, and Miles Davis's band from the On the Corner era. Prince was the greatest I've ever seen. When I say he shredded, I mean I literally thought his guitar would bust into flames. And at one point in the show I heard a lick that sounded a lot like Jimmy Paige. My thought was literally, ""Don't compare this to Led Zeppelin. Prince is his own thing so enjoy it for what it is. It's not heavy rock music."" And then, two songs later, he busted out a cover of Whole Lot of Love and made it even better than Zeppelin. Unbelievable!"
