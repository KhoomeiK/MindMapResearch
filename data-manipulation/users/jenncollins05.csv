TrueOffMyChest,ffhiwgp,t1_ffhiljb,1579937294.0,I know your right but I just get so mad at racist it's like I can't even think I just react. I once slapped my little sister full on hard as I could in the face for saying the N word.
AmItheAsshole,ffhis98,t3_etnlt6,1579937141.0,Yeah that would me like if you said your back hurts could she please rub it and all she did was tell you all the reasons hers was so much worse. Then basically said sick it up and left. Honestly you be lucky if she doesn't set you on fire while your sleeping. YTA
TrueOffMyChest,ffhi9x6,t3_etnmnd,1579936471.0,Oh didn't know it was against the rules. In those situations I make sure they know they are a racist prick and I hate them.

relationship_advice,ffh3xc3,t3_etky78,1579922436.0,"Ok if your genuinely afraid of the face to face and I get that. Flowers not roses, get orchids in her favorite color. Ask her out in the note. Its sweet romantic and takes some of the anxiety out of it. Make sure the note is a bit romantic too. Again Good Luck you got this."
relationship_advice,ffh37fc,t3_etky78,1579921878.0,Dude man up tell the girl you like her and want to take her out. If she says no you've lost nothing. If she says yes and that is a real possibility here you get the GIRL!!! Good Luck

AmItheAsshole,fffy6on,t3_etd4lv,1579894380.0,Sorry I think I married the perfect guy he'd never get mad over me just talking to a guy. We've also been married for 15 yrs so its different. Back in the day though I had a guy all of a sudden think I was cheating for no real reason andbcome to find out he got drunk and fucked up.
AmItheAsshole,fffxe49,t3_etd4lv,1579893887.0,Do then if its okay for him why is he freaking out on you? When guys do this out of the blue it makes me think that he's seeing cheating because he is.
AmItheAsshole,fffqxoq,t3_etd4lv,1579889870.0,It's sounds like someone has a guilty concious. Did you go through his phone?
offmychest,fffqey4,t3_etd4y8,1579889548.0,"Ok forget everything he has said and done in the last year. That was not your grandfather apeaking to you it was the sickness. I'm so sorry he let the despair get to him. I wish I knew a way to fix it. Your right though if you let him go like this you'll always regret it. So try and blame the sickness instead of him. Make him go outside even in a wheelchair even if he cusses you the entire way. Make fun of him, remind him who he was, yell back if you have to, tell him what you told us and then let him know you love him no matter what. Make fight even if it hurts. Good luck and know that you are a good man."
AmItheAsshole,fffpo9p,t3_etd531,1579889088.0,NTA but make up anyway. Nor for go in but for you and those babies. It sounds like might regret it. At least give him the chance to apologize. People sometimes say stupid shit but later grow up. Use this as a way to change his mind and make him not a biogt. Even if nothing's changed and you have to go no contact again at least you won't feel this sense of regret you do now. You'll be free.
aww,fffmsu8,t3_etd5bw,1579887335.0,Oh my gosh so cute!!

TrueOffMyChest,fffd8ag,t3_eta1bc,1579881394.0,Save up a little bit and do a cute destination vowel renewal just the two of you. I'm assuming you still have the dress and him the tux so you can redo the pictures on a beach somewhere and then instant honeymoon. Also please tell husband he should not have let mil do that to you ever.

ProRevenge,ffebljo,t3_et5j86,1579842251.0,Oh my god I love this story so much. It reminds me of a time I was working at the hospital and this guy came in on the ambulance for alcohol poisoning. Naturally we call next of kin especially if you come in unconscious. Well we were in Florida but his wife was in Alabama. So we got to call his wife to come get him after he passed out in his car from alcohol poisoning and couldnt be woken up. Of course the first thing she asks is why is he in florida and where did we pick him up. We picked him up at the golden nugget an infamous tiitty bar. The poor guy left the state so he wouldnt get caught and then drinks so much this happens. When his wife showed up he jumped out of the bed so fast he Damn near ripped out his catheter. He was so scared of his wife he didn't even notice he had one.

Assistance,ffe8h8n,t3_et4yl7,1579839572.0,Take her to the closest Catholic church. They usually have gift cards to Wal-Mart and local grocery stores for this kind of thing and saved me in the past. Also they usually help with rent and utilities as well. If in Arizona it's st Vincent we Paul. I don't get paid till tom but will try to send something then.
