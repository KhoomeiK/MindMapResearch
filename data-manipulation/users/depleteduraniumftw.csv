My point exactly."

I understand how they *can* work in some cases.

I am not. But I also haven't killed a bunch of innocent strangers in foreign lands in order to further enrich oil barons and weapons manufacturers.

It better be. I have seen plenty of military dudes take big doses, completely lose their shit, and have to be physically restrained for 8+ hours to prevent them from hurting themselves and others. 

There is a reason they have such high rates of suicide."

Wrong again.

*“We are all wired into a survival trip now. No more of the speed that fueled that 60's. That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip. He crashed around America selling ""consciousness expansion"" without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait for all the people who took him seriously... All those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit. But their loss and failure is ours too. What Leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped create... a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force - is tending the light at the end of the tunnel.”*"

MDMA doesn't put you through 10+ hours of hellishly intense introspection. Mushrooms certainly do. Not to say it isn't beneficial. But I still can't recommend it for the karmically challenged. 

> Also, his UBI proposal is $1k per person, per month, not $10k.

Equally retarded. 

*The primary reason why the individual citizens of a country create a political structure is a subconscious wish or desire to perpetuate their own dependency relationship of childhood. Simply put, they want a human god to eliminate all risk from their life, pat them on the head, kiss their bruises, put a chicken on every dinner table, clothe their bodies, tuck them into bed at night, and tell them that everything will be alright when they wake up in the morning.*

*This public demand is incredible, so the human god, the politician, meets incredibility with incredibility by promising the world and delivering nothing. So who is the bigger liar? the public? or the ""godfather""?*

*This public behavior is surrender born of fear, laziness, and expediency. It is the basis of the welfare state as a strategic weapon, useful against a disgusting public.*"
RationalPsychonaut,ffxauxd,t1_ffwr34o,1580321367.0,No.. I am pretty sure buying votes with empty promises of free money is the central pillar of his campaign.
RationalPsychonaut,ffw8ly2,t3_evhac6,1580289632.0,Eight hours of being painfully and intensely reminded of all the horrible shit you've done. Sounds like a great idea. Right up there with giving everyone $10K/month.
