ContagiousLaughter,ffgqijo,t1_ffgkvv9,1579912494.0,"Sprinkler piping doesn’t need to be potable and is rarely flushed.  Oil and dirt from construction doesn’t get cleaned out and the water just sits there for years, sometimes decades.  It’s nasty and it smells bad."
ContagiousLaughter,ffgqde6,t1_ffggtmv,1579912388.0,Usually fire fighters will close the incoming on the sprinkler system and open the drain.  If they waited for the sprinkler company to show up the water damage would be crazy.  Building owners are allowed to operate their sprinkler valves in emergency situations so I’m sure they’re grateful that the FD does it when they show up.

AskReddit,fek06jk,t3_epfjje,1579189784.0,"This almost shouldn’t count as I’ve completely blocked it out.  About 25 years ago I broke my leg,  snapped my femur.  It took over 24 hours and so they had to re-break it before any treatment.  My dad reminds me of it from time to time,  my mom had to leave the room and I held my little spider man toy as the doctor snapped my leg with no painkillers or sedation.  Completely missing from my memory banks"

AskReddit,fe6i0td,t3_enyp0q,1578891525.0,"Was staying on the 14th floor of an apartment building with balconies.  A woman two floors down, directly below the apartment, jumped to her death while I was out having a smoke. I didn’t see her fall or the impact but I heard it,  and then looked down and saw the aftermath.  It was dark and 14 floors up but I could see that she broke her skull open on the concrete.  It took a moment to process what I was seeing.  In the morning I had to walk by the area and a few ravens were there,  eating brain matter.  Pretty fucking disturbing."
