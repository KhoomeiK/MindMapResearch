AskReddit,fgjntra,t3_eyskct,1580847860.0,Elder scrolls and Legend of Zelda. I didn't get to start with the super old ones. But Oblivion and Windwaker really made me fall in love.
AskWomen,fgjnoku,t3_eyrajh,1580847777.0,"It's like night and day, the first one I was with would tell me my hope for the future were stupid. He treated me like a child. I have depression and it was undiagnosed at that point so I was constantly crying because of his actions and words. But my fiance has never made me feel that way ever. He trys to help me find my dreams and follow them. He's only ever supported me. I don't feel like I have to hide who I am around him. I am so happy with him, he makes every day worth waking up"
CaneCorso,fgjn02t,t3_eyq3kq,1580847381.0,"My boy loves hide and seek. He always sprints around the house or yard looking for us, in the fun happy way. When he finds us he gets super excited. He loves it so much that he has started trying to hide from us and making us find him. He knows he knows his best camouflage is bushes and darkness. So when we take him out at night he'll find a dark corner and sit there. Once you find him he gets really excited and sprints around the yard, then runs to the door. My boy is not as interested in finding his toys."
unpopularopinion,fgjmh8e,t3_eyr62d,1580847075.0,"I completely agree. It always bothered me when my sister talked about her wedding ring, she always said that it's only temporary until he can get her a bigger diamond. Why does it matter? Like it's a freaking ring, they proposed. Is their love not enough?"
tomatoes,fgiozee,t3_eynvzc,1580827586.0,"I grew up in an area which was pretty much always 100+ majority of the year. My advice is when it does get that hot try to keep them out of the afternoon sun. And lots of water will be your friend. The heat itself never really hurt mine that bad, but the heat combined with the afternoon sun would mess up my plants big time."
depression,fgiobrs,t3_eyivud,1580827128.0,"I would report that asshat to anyone hire, f him. The reason you shouldn't is find a new school, one with professors that will actually help with your depression, be super upfront about it at the beginning. Go to free counseling, graduate then go shovel your degree in that aholes face. But seriously the only reason I finally graduated was because I talked with my professors about my depression up front. And they would sometimes give me extensions if I needed it, or send me emails about what I missed in class if I was not doing well. I've even had professors let me miss class to go to therapy. You'll be surprised there are a lot more of the ones that care our there than not."
Dogtraining,fghr59y,t3_eyk0ia,1580791543.0,"When we were first adopting our boy, every breed specific training site told us his breed has trouble with dominance, and that we can't let him sleep on the bed because he'll think he is the pack leader. We kept him off the bed for the first couple days. Then let him on, it literally didn't affect anything with his training. In fact I think it helped his training a little more. He was abused before we got him, so I think him sleeping next to us made him feel more loved, and more willing to listen."

AskWomen,fgaxtfc,t3_exks37,1580656500.0,"Not really a run in but awkward as heck. I dated a guy pretty much all through highschool, we broke up when I went out of state for college. He didn't trust me and was acting like I wash cheating on him, being a big ahole. After the break up that was it, we went out separate ways. Well I end up transferring back to my hometown university because I hated the out of state one. I went there without ever seeing him for a year. Well one day I was walking to class, I was also walking pretty fast because I was running late. I look up and in front of me is my ex walking in the same direction. I think oh crap but put my head down and keep walking, out of the corner of my eye I see him kind of turn his head. He definitely notices me and picked up his speed. I think he might have thought I was trying to catch up to him. So basically we are maintaining the same speed walking in the same direction. Luckily my class came up and I quickly ducked into the room. Thankfully I never saw him around that area again."

LandscapingTips,fg3mlxt,t1_fg2qqjs,1580485072.0,"You would be surprised how much one person can trash an area with them, even if 9/10 people actually pick them up that one person that doesn't, can create a lot more trash than you think. My brother in law doesnt pick his up, as much as everyone yells at him and tries to force him to do it, he doesn't. In a weekend he can create a huge pile and make an entire half acre look like someone had a smoking party."

She may actually be medically licensed, but some people do it then turn away from actual medical science so they can see harmefull nonsense."
AskReddit,fg32b64,t3_ewcpzl,1580467079.0,"Kind of petty probably, but my friend planned a trip to Vegas and invited me, I told her I might be able to but it all depends on my financial situation because I was just t making a lot back then. So anyway the trip is a month away and that's when I finally know that there is no way I am going to afford this trip. I talk to her about it she's instantly mad. Apparently she planned the whole trip around me driving. So I end up going because ""she's my friend and I have to be nice."". The whole trip she act like a child, she doesn't take anyone's concerns, walks off on her own, ignores everyone and does whatever she wants. Then has the audacity to get mad at us for asking her to stay closer to everyone. Then on the drive home she gets super high as my navigator. And we have to drop all of her friends off at different points in a huge city. So I end up having to navigate myself while driving. My mom ends up trying to call multiple times, at one point I quickly answer and let her know. I can't talk I need to use navigation. (My phone couldn't run both programs) my ""friend"" got mad at me again for some reason. Telling me to just answer the phone. I told her that I needed navigation to get through this city and that my phone doesn't do both. She then begins to say she could have driven. (Something she never offered to do until that point) I told her it's fine I just wish she wasn't high and could have helped me navigate this city, she then proceeds to get even more mad, unbuckles herself from my car, and proceeds to hang half her body out the car window yelling. All of her friends remained silent in the back seat. I dropped two of her friends off then finished the two hour drive home and dropped her off. Deleted her off of everything, and have not talked to her since."

AskReddit,ffqk17m,t1_ffpaamw,1580136719.0,"I was in a similar situation but I went through all of highschool keeping to myself. Even the people I was close with didn't even really invite me to anything. I went off to college and came back, reaquanted with some of my friends who introduced me to other people I knew from school, but never really got to know. If that makes sense. But pretty much every one of them after hanging out with me a couple of times admitted that they thought I was really stuck up in highschool. It really makes me wonder what would have happened if I wasn't so shy"
TooAfraidToAsk,ffqh6wz,t3_eukwcp,1580134489.0,"I honestly thought I was ok with it, and I worked for a decent amount of time, but I recently lost my job. And I have been loving the freedom. Ive been able to actually get things done around the house, and play with the dogs. My partner has even admitted that it's nice having one of us at home. The house was never as clean before because we never had time to clean it. Our had too much energy, we would take him on walks when we got home but during winter our neighborhood turns into a muddy swamp. So it's pretty much impossible to walk him around. I've been able to cook dinner, instead of both of us just finding what left overs we have from the weekend. Or just eating a microwave meal. I'll still need to find another fill time job, but I'm probably never going to stop finding a career where I can have even some of this freedom again."
