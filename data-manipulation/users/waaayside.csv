Dodgers,ffot2qe,t1_ffopur6,1580081395.0,Through the generosity of another I was there too.  I describe this as a moment for me and 50K of my closest friends.  It meant so much and I had this picture as my screen saver for over a year.  I love to see that Kobe was so happy for those HE was watching.  I'm sure it's something else to be on the receiving end of the roar of the crowd and it's heartwarming to see him celebrating someone.  I bet it was special to have him in your corner cheering you on knowing how hard he worked.  He will be missed.
