CFB,ffi1k2p,t1_ffi1gce,1579962319.0,He’s a catcher so his numbers and MVP are going to get in.
CFB,ffi0iws,t3_etr2z3,1579961350.0,"Mauer never played a down of college football, he signed with the Twins after they drafted him. He’s not bust, he just chose another sport (one where he’s going to be in the HOF)."
NYGiants,ffgo7mu,t1_ffgo1y5,1579910861.0,"Against COLLEGE pass rushers. Ereck Flowers looked good in college. He has bad footwork, he’s going to get exposed by NFL Edge rushers."
NYGiants,ffgnppc,t1_ffgncbi,1579910511.0,Georgia barely passes the ball and NFL evaluators are saying he’s a mid to late 1st round talent. Most players look good in college and aren’t as good in the NFL because you can get away with bad technique when you’re physically gifted. I don’t think he’ll be horrible but not worth pick 4.
NYGiants,fffckoi,t1_fffbfql,1579880983.0,Becton is going 4 in mock drafts
NYGiants,fff8k9f,t1_fff8bu7,1579878394.0,"Completely different circumstances. DJ was on a roster with zero other NFL talent. Andrew Thomas was on an NFL factory Georgia. He has bad footwork and is average in college at pass blocking, which typically doesn’t get better in the NFL. He’s a first round pick, just not one you take at 4."
NYGiants,fff8872,t1_fff875r,1579878160.0,Agreed
NYGiants,fff7ifx,t1_fff6pkr,1579877668.0,"I assume you mean Isaiah Simmons. O-line is kinda top Heavy this year. My belief is that Wills, Wirfs, and Becton are just better players in pass protection while being as good or just below Thomas in run blocking. I’d be good with taking Simmons at 4 if we solve Edge (Ngakoue?)and OT (Conklin) in free agency. My ideal offseason is we sign those two then draft Simmons, trade back into the late 1st for the C Biadasz from Wisconsin. That would solve our four biggest holes."
NYGiants,fff6tis,t1_fff5zkn,1579877182.0,"Like two, Trent Williams & Lane Johnson. Ronnie Stanley was just outside your criteria as he was picked 6th overall in his draft."
NYGiants,fff54zp,t1_fff51k6,1579875952.0,"He’s not saying that, he’s relaying what NFL people are telling him. As in more than one."

todayilearned,feybrog,t1_fextxj1,1579443405.0,"Never even heard of Hollywood video so I had to look them up. They were pretty big but not compared to Blockbuster. Blockbuster was everywhere, it looks like Hollywood video wasn’t even in every state."
todayilearned,fex6r2f,t3_equ0ve,1579425514.0,The only reason they were able to get away with that is because they were really the only option. There were smaller video rental stores but they didn’t have the selection blockbuster had. Pretty funny to think everyone dealt with that BS not all that long ago.
