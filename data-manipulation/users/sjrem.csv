chocolate,ffgbxb8,t3_etdtck,1579902845.0,Wow! Those are awesome!
aww,fdwj3o2,t3_ekkfe7,1578759189.0,"Just want to send out a heartfelt thank you to all the incredibly supportive and positive commenters out there! I literally just snapped the pic and thought “hey this could go on r/aww” and it took off from there! Parenting is one of the toughest jobs there is, and I was sincerely touched by all of the positive feedback the post got. Wasn’t my intention but boy does it feel good! The other side of the coin, as we all know, are the unseen, unposted difficulties that can go on between parents and kids. We all have our amazing moments and we also have our share of embarrassing, challenging ones. Thanks for sharing in one of our amazing ones! It ain’t easy!

To answer one of the many questions- our hound does have other dog beds around the house! She hangs off of all of them, so my son thought she needed one she could fit her whole body on. I didn’t argue! He feels happy every time he sees her on it (which is often). I went ahead and bought our other dog (a small, feisty Pomeranian, another rescue) a new super cozy, little bed.. so now they’re even! :)

Cheers!"

AskNOLA,fdr0ti6,t3_em07dc,1578677928.0,"Hi! My dad and I have been meeting up in NOLA for years, to go to JazzFest. We always stay in the Garden District - more specifically at the Prytania Park Hotel. Highly recommend. Not fancy though - expect a modestly refurbished NOLA style building, with basic coffee / breakfast and nice front desk people. There are one or two more hotels associated with this one, in the same neighborhood, I think. We stay there and then walk one block to the streetcar and off you go! Easy peasy! Fantastic walking neighborhood.. tons of excellent eats. Good luck!"
ParentingADHD,fdqz3d7,t3_emiuah,1578677147.0,"Thank you for posting on this subreddit and sharing what you are going through. It's very hard, parenting, no matter what, and it sounds like you have your share of challenges! I hope this is helpful.

I have a VERY stubborn younger son, who was diagnosed with ""subthreshhold"" adhd and has most of the symptoms. Along with this, he is extremely moody. Yes to what all of the other posters have said, and I would also add, it would be really good for your daughter to be heard and validated by you, as well as given appropriate boundaries. For example, if she says she hates you and wants to go live with GG, I would say back, ""Yes, I understand that you hate me and you want to go live with GG. You're allowed to have your feelings. It's ok."" And then go from there. I think she needs to feel unconditionally loved and accepted by you, and then, later on, she will be able to love and accept you back. When she's cooled down you could then say, ""When you say you ""hate"" someone, that is a really strong word and can really hurt. Can you talk about what it is the person is doing that is making you feel that way? Instead of saying you hate them?"" That kind of thing. She's feeling badly already, that's clear, so if you can stay steady and strong for her, and support her, that will be so valuable. She'll learn to trust you again. Right now she doesn't really know what's what. Some resources I've found helpful are Aha Parenting, and the ADDitude website.

Lastly, I'll tell you this - my younger son who I mentioned above needs a TON of structure. Much more than your average kid. I would suspect if you make things extremely predictable (as much as possible) for your daughter, that would help. I'm sure you are already trying to do this! They are very visual and concrete at that age, so use that (like make pictures for what you are trying to explain, create a colorful ""thermometer"" that you can post up so she can point and tell you how mad she is etc etc.) Keep on trying, don't give up, and get help wherever you can! Totally normal to go through major frustrations with kids, don't be too hard on yourself either! :)

EDIT: Gosh one last thing... keep that girl busy busy busy!! The more they have to do, the less trouble they will get in! I had to constantly provide activities / things to do for my boys - otherwise they tore the house up!"

ParentingADHD,fdgn920,t3_el2gkw,1578402958.0,"If I was you I would get a full neuropsych done and then work with a psychiatrist to get her on the right meds. It will be worth it. Sometimes insurance companies cover these things as “out of network” bc they can be expensive (if that’s an issue). 
It def sounds like she’s not functioning at her best and it probably doesn’t feel good. I say this with full compassion. We have a son who is an extremely deep sleeper and is also very difficult to get up in the mornings. He has a few other diagnoses also, which is why I’m on this subreddit!
So many conditions are “co-morbid” (sounds intimidating but it just means there are multiple things that are related/ connected). We also have a family history of ADD. Your daughter’s body and mind may be telling her “why get up when things are so overwhelming? Easier to just sleep”. That’s a common side effect, I think, with ADD. 
Good luck and keep us posted!"
DOG,fdf68d7,t3_ekvkrl,1578354249.0,Yep - I’m the OP.. Just starting to use reddit for the first time here so I didn’t cross post my own content fast enough I guess! Anyway..

aww,fdcsyla,t1_fdcpdlk,1578283438.0,One of the big box stores (trying not to be an advertiser) definitely on sale. Like another poster said - great to check the discount outlets. They always seem to have a lot of extra pet supplies!

aww,fdcs3ju,t1_fdcnw0z,1578282711.0,"Funny you mention it - I actually took him to HomeGoods first bc I thought there was no way he was going to find the kind of big dog bed he wanted for her in one of the big box stores. But when we went (to Home Goods), none of the beds were “big enough” and he wouldn’t change his mind. So off we went to the big box store next door and there we found the sale. Honestly- it was just good timing! I like to check the discount stores first too!"

dogs,fda9hw1,t3_ek4rw0,1578243279.0,"Yay!! We have a treeing walker coonhound we reduced in 2015. She’s an energizer bunny. 
Every doggo is different but I have found that hounds have very distinct on and off buttons:  ON (on walks, hikes, or runs) or OFF (couch potato / snuggler).  Often not a lot of in betweens!

Tips:
-These dogs want to find and bring you food (the hunt). They have been trained for centuries not to come back to you unless their job is done. Recall can be difficult if not impossible! So go easy on yourself. Keep on leash as much as you can. Once on a scent, they’re gone!
-As tempting as they are, avoid dog parks. You don’t know what your dog has been thru. Our sweet girl got very nervous around a testy German shepherd, after I had first adopted her, and they got into a fight and my dog bit the other one! Ugh! Too unpredictable for our girl. 
- Hounds are very sensitive, especially to physical touch. Can be good or bad..

Check out Tyler Muto! Incredible trainer and has tons of online stuff. Also- personally I love Ed Frawley on Leerburg.com. These people know their dogs and can help you immensely in a short time!"
sahm,fd03bh9,t1_fbuhkz5,1578113010.0,Yep!
sahm,fd032ts,t1_fd01ud4,1578112911.0,"I would ditto that. About a year before our first child was born , we tried to live on one income and save the rest. I think that’s the best way to prepare.. After you have the baby, you should try to keep a toe in your industry, just so you have options. Also, plan for some kind of help (babysitter or whatever..) because lo and behold, full time baby care is a ton of work and you will be exhausted! But it’s all worth it :) Anyway - even if you are technically not paying for childcare since you’ll be home, my point is that you will still need to pay for help here and there as you go along. (Unless you have family around who can and are willing to help? Whole other story..) That’s my two cents!"
sahm,fcyjlkn,t3_ejd0dg,1578081158.0,"Great question! I have two boys, 12 and 16, and I’m still at home with them, managing the household, even though I never imagined I’d stay home this long. 

I remember when  the questions, “When are you going back to work” or “Are you going back to work?” would come up frequently. You are so understanding and compassionate, to see that these are just curiosities, and honestly, it’s what they know. It actually fades as your kids get older. People start to know the answer, or don’t need to ask for one reason or another. The parents I hang with (we are all at around the same stage of parenting) have all realized at this point that there are gigantic compromises every way you cut it, so there are no right answers! Ha! Peace at last! 

We all feel for each other. The parents who work FT have realized what they’ve missed out on, but have accepted that they had to or wanted to work and that’s ok. We, the sahm and sahd’s (?), have also realized how much we’ve missed out on, but have accepted that we chose to stay home and are content with that,and feel grateful (and often, strapped for cash and restless!). 

When people ask me the question now, (usually younger people I meet at my spouses office parties!) I say, “I don’t know. I have some ideas I’m working on so we’ll see what happens!” And that’s that!

Final note - I really love the idea of both partners working - either one FT and one PT, or both PT. Sadly our country (and the world?) makes both of those options very challenging financially. My spouse works FT - partially because I’m at home, but more realistically, it’s the *reason* I’m at home. He basically works 12-14 hour days, every day, except the weekend. Not ideal but it is what it is!"
ParentingADHD,fcuea9q,t1_fcuda3s,1577978909.0,"Nice! I’m going to mention it to my son’s therapist today. It would be great if we could just go thru our pediatrician - although they always seem to refer out to psychiatrists for these things. I’m thinking it may be a regulation in our part of the country (New York), but we’ll see."
chocolate,fcucbmv,t1_fctg516,1577977642.0,"Thank you for your insights nechronius! Yes - everything you have said makes sense and I'm sure all of these issues are at the root of the problem with the Toll House chocolate chips. I think we all will be seeing more about this issue soon....after rooting around on the internet a bit, I found this:

[https://www.verybestbaking.com/products/4031/tollhouse/nestle-toll-house-semi-sweet-chocolate-morsels/](https://www.verybestbaking.com/products/4031/tollhouse/nestle-toll-house-semi-sweet-chocolate-morsels/)

On this website, there are approximately 2844 reviews of the chips. Many of the current reviews are extremely poor, and restate my original question. Here are some samples of the review titles:

""Terrible! What did you do?""

""What happened to these chips?""

""Extremly sad""

""Now I Know My Tastebuds Are Not Off""

I also found this info, which is not entirely unrelated because it's about a lack of quality control, on Wikipedia:

""In 2019, Nestlé announced that they couldn't guarantee that their chocolate products were free from child slave labour, as they could trace only 49% of their purchasing back to the farm level. The [*Washington Post*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Post) noted that the commitment taken in 2001 to eradicate such practices within 4 years had not been kept, neither at the due deadline of 2005, nor within the revised deadlines of 2008 and 2010, and that the result was not likely to be achieved for 2020 either.\[142\]""

I know that, sadly, none of this is a huge surprise. It just drives home to me how inherently untrustworthy these large corporations are. I think the sad part for me is that I trusted the Toll House brand and now I feel like I've been blatantly lied to via false advertising. It's just not the same product, but it's in the same exact packaging, has the same labeling, etc. They are even telling people nothing has been changed when clearly something big \*has\* changed. Little tweaks here and there are understandable, but not when the product changes so drastically. 

All the more reason to save up and buy this stuff more carefully and conscientiously, which is what I will be doing from now on!! Time to reward the people who are trying to do the right thing!"

ParentingADHD,fcqzmba,t3_ei98un,1577894583.0,"Hi, thanks for posting. I would be interested in hearing how it goes for you, as well as hearing from others. Our 12 yo son has ADHD and is also very moody and sensitive, so finding the right medication has been tricky. Currently he’s not taking anything but I feel like we need to start.

Did your regular pediatrician prescribe this or is the scrip from a psychiatrist? Just curious. Would be nice if the pediatrician could just handle, to minimize all the appointments etc. 

I know it’s important to stay open-minded. I found this article from that has some helpful tips, especially for the eating. Good luck!

sahm,fbtdx6m,t3_ee7qfu,1577075679.0,"Because you sound like you sincerely want it - definitely try the SAHM life for a while. Otherwise you will regret it!  Having kids changes you on a cellular level. There is no way to describe it and no real way to prepare, because you just won’t know til you’re there. Personally, the physical exhaustion really surprised me - I don’t think I was ready for it.  But over time I figured it out. Later, I realized I was missing out on my career (I was a teacher too) but I wouldn’t trade any of it. The bottom line is, you can’t have it all. Once you accept that (and that takes time), then everything sort of gels. We moved a lot while I was having the kids (two boys, now 12 and 16), so it was hard to establish any kind of part time work. My advice would be - stay at home with them until they’ve got a daily school routine set up (like kinder or first grade) then get back to part time work if possible. The social part of working is really important. Also, kids need to learn that everything won’t be there for them every second. If mom was at work and they need to help with dinner - awesome! Last thing - just remember - whatever happens and whatever you decide - it’s the right thing. :)"
