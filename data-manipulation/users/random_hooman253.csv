aww,fcb1h5k,t3_egwg31,1577580863.0,"My best friend is a Staffordshire terrior aka a staffy and he is the most goofy loyal and happy dog ever be is terrified of cats and his favourite thing to do is chase his tail and chew things 😂 but I get told by numerous people that my dogs breed is viscous and a poor choice for a family pet as they can attack at any given moment but you know what? It disgusts me how some people are so inconsiderate to certain dog breeds because they are ""viscous"" but they don't realise that there little lap dogs can attack too it depends on how a dog or a cat or any animal is treated by there owners NOT there breed. God I hate people like this and they don't deserve their pets, I love all breeds of dog, cat etc. Anyways goodbye whoever was bothered to read this rant of mine 👋"
