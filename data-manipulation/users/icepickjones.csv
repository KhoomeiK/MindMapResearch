It's not people playing vidya games as much as it's the garbage coming out of the industrial food complex.

Also, yeah it makes sense because every piece of food is processed to hell and back to save a buck nowadays - they load them up with things to make the food more addictive / taste better but also so that it can artificially extend a shelf life. Corn syrup is cheaper than sugar, it helps the bottom line but it fucks up a person's health.

So real ingredients and clean healthy food is thereby more expensive and become a luxury for the wealthy. It's a punishment for not having enough money. It also explains why Mississippi, one of the poorest states, has the high obesity problem."

This one was so different. The Brock phase was interesting if for no other reason I was like who else will come out and get the 1v1 squash? And who will be the one to stop him?

And then everyone who put up even a little fight got huge pops - Kofi, Keith, Braun, Big E. And then Drew got the mother of all pops when he finally put Brock out. 

You need the lows in order to achieve the highs. 

And then after that segment we got Drew doing a few squashes, which was fine. Then we got to a proper Rumble for the last third and had a bunch of fun small stories in there. You had Edge come back and actually hang around. Fun stuff with Rated RKO. Seth and his faction causing shenanagins. Owens and Joe pushing their stuff. And what ended up being a great finish.

They gave Drew a massive push just by stopping Brock. He didn't even need to win and he already had a rocket on his back. They just doubled it by having him win as well.

I think Kimura loses. But my fingers are crossed that it somehow, in the course of the fight, gets Ippo back in the ring.

He's got 2 protoges who can't keep up, boxers hes training who can't keep up, maybe self doubting Ippo finally realizes he's got the fire to fight, but he's got deeper personal depths than he realized?

It all hit at the same time and we ended up with Trump, when even he didn't think he would win. Or want to win. 

I think a big part if it was suburbs. The cities all go heavy blue, the rural all goes dark red. The fucking suburbs decided ""eh fuck it, let's see with this reality show host can do"" and took shit for granted. I know a lot of people that rolled the dice with Trump's outsider talk.

They want money, they want to be rich, they want to stay rich, they want income inequality, they want more stuff. All the other issues are obfuscations. Since the 80's it's about tax cuts and staying flush with cash by any means necessary. All the religious shit and fake christianity and gun talk? It's just a way to gloss over the talking points that might get to the heart of the matter - tax cuts and fat wallets. If they can do some magic and distract from that periodically all the better. 

So with that in mind, put the shoe on the other foot for a moment as a **thought experiment**:

Pretend Donald is still himself. He's a complete piece of shit human being but he's now a Democrat. And think about what your single issue is. Healthcare? Global Warming? Whatever it is, whatever the thing you are most passionate about, I want you to hold it in your mind. 

**Now pretend Donald is delivering that to you.** 

Yes he's still a borish clod and he's still slurring his words and being a general piece of shit - but now he's also delivering the one thing you want. He's giving free healthcare to millions and pushing that shit through despite all protestations. He's cracking down on pollution and forming a green new deal to fight climate change.

It's weird to think about right? You feel differently now, even just for a second? I get it.

I get why they do what they do and I get why they ignore what they ignore. I understand why the put up with him, even though they obviously hate him. I don't think the issue they fight for is right. I don't think putting personal monetary gain above everyone else is a good thing - but I at least understand why they are doing it.

Well until Battlegrounds, that mode brought me back to the fold for a while but I'm finally cooling off on it until new cards or mode changes happen."
nfl,fdiaqvq,t1_fdia1jp,1578438816.0,"It's not ""a coach"" it's a hof coach and a hof QB. You act like Belichick just farted his way into town yesterday. Like he hasn't built and molded pieces that other teams threw away. Like he hasn't taken low draft picks, under performers, nobodies, and won superbowls with them ... and Brady.

And obviously I think he would do well on the Titans, that's been my opinion on this whole thing. I think you would need to give him a minute to mold the culture and everything but he's a proven winner and I feel like these things start at the top and bleed down. I'm not knocking Brady at all, he's an animal, he singlehandedly willed them into beating Atlanta and coming back in that Superbowl. 

If Brady leaves and goes to San Diego you think he's winning a superbowl next season?"
nfl,fdi9vy3,t1_fdi77ui,1578438360.0,"I don't diminish Brees. I don't diminish Brady either, he's the best QB ever. I'm just saying if you made me pick which was more important to the best QB/Coach combo of all time I'm ranking Coach Belichick higher. What I don't understand is how you are finding ways to get personally offended about it somehow. Are you Tom Brady?"
eagles,fdi5vsm,t1_fdi599t,1578436280.0,"I'm OK with load management, it's a long season - they should honestly shorten it. 

I think the rules need to be reworked. And I don't blame players for kicking their legs out because the rules reward it if there's a smidgen of contact, but I think intent needs to be factored. I'd like hand checking to come back a little bit but by and large rules pushing people from the paint led to more scoring and that's more exciting. So I get it. Harden at the line 6000 times per game does get boring though."
eagles,fdi4ydx,t1_fdgytvz,1578435812.0,Didn't they have a commercial for fucking helmets and bullshit during the game?
eagles,fdi4sbj,t1_fdh2fp5,1578435731.0,"I still watch NFL but I've really scaled down. It's two part for me - the injuries (I legit feel sort of bad knowing these guys are getting brain damage for my entertainment) and the application of rules (you can call pass interference and holding on literally every play if you wanted - its inconsistent as shit)

It's just not fun. I like MLB and NBA more at this point."
TumblrInAction,fdi48gk,t3_eld7a7,1578435448.0,"I've seen a lot of hot takes against Ricky all of the sudden about this. 

What he said was funny and none of it was wrong. He was lambasting their hypocrisy. This isn't a partisan thing, it's attacking the wealthy elite if nothing else. 

But all of the sudden media companies are releasing hot take articles shitting on what was a funny roast. And quick question because I don't have time to google it, who owns those companies? I'm just curious. Oh the very same wealthy elite that dared to get a little burn thrown their way? OK cool."
nfl,fdi2xkb,t1_fdhxsc4,1578434780.0,"Well I'm thinking about in 2008 when Brady got hurt and Belicheck took Cassel to an 11-5 record. Although I'll give you credit, they still missed the playoffs that year. That's a fluke though, having an 11 win season is great and usually is a playoff apperance. Also Garappolo and Brisset when Brady was suspended did great in those 4 games. 

Overall Bill coaching the Patriots without Brady is 13-6."

sixers,fdga2c1,t3_el541w,1578386603.0,We have Joel who's great in the paint and Simmons who is great in the paint. We have 2 centers. And Horford who is great in the paint. So we have 3 centers. Ya know on a smaller team Harris could run as a power forward. Ok we have 4 centers.
nfl,fdg99li,t1_fdfzusj,1578385522.0,"Beating Brady and Belicheck at the top of their game, in a barn burner, with our backup QB, in a playoff run when every single game we were the odds on favorite to lose. Magical run."
nfl,fdg949n,t1_fdfstwr,1578385324.0,"Birds got em though. Got em good. I'd have killed for Andy to have his ring when he was here, and losing the SB 39 to them was murder, but I have to admit having a backup beat the legends for SB 52 revenge when Pats were on top and supposed to cruise to another title, and the Eagles were the underdog every game of the playoffs. Feels good. 

On the other side I have nothing but sympathy for Falcons fans. That one had to have hurt."
nfl,fdg8yte,t1_fdfs3kw,1578385122.0,"They are both amazing ... but I've seen Belichick succeed without Brady when he's been hurt or suspended. I know he can do it, the man is a football genius. It's unfair because I only have half the data, I haven't seen Brady without Bill, but I think Belichick is 60% of the power and Brady is 40% in the joint venture."

But they wouldn't do it stop you or stand up to anyone else."
eagles,fdfqmn7,t1_fde4qca,1578367847.0,At least he agreed it was a dirty hit. I mean he said it should have been an immediate ejection and said this was specifically the kind of play the targeting rule is there to prevent.
eagles,fdfqi1z,t3_ekwssd,1578367766.0,"Max said it right about targeting.

It's good and bad. It's good in that I make a lot of money and everything is 100% on me. The bad is that everything is 100% on me - and I can never stop. Weekends, vacations, etc. I'm still always checking emails on my phone and sending shit out."

The best eps were the ones that were straight up supernatural or sci fi. The one about the alien tourist was good. The comedian I really liked. Those were flawed characters, with a diverse cast, that were interesting stories, without dislocating their shoulder from reaching too hard."

When he leads with his helmet? And goes after the other team's QB's head? No, that's dirty as shit. 

That's super fucked up. You weren't trying to give him a pop so he remembers you, you are trying to remove him from the game via injury on purpose. 

Fuck Clowny, he's a dirty player."
nfl,fdd592b,t1_fdbwffo,1578295372.0,Brady or Rogers take that hit and Clowny is thrown in the jail under the stadium. The refs would cuff him live on the field.
