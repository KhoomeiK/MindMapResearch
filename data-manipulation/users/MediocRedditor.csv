If this is as bad as we can expect when we build a plant on a fault line and hit it with a tsunami then nuclear power is worth it. 

Not to mention, the earthquake and the tsunami weren’t actually what caused the release, but the inability to maintain continuity of electrical power to the cooling pumps. The power went out, the diesels kicked in, the diesels ran out of diesel, they couldn’t get power back, temperature and pressure were out of control.

science,ffgdzps,t1_fffa6mb,1579904122.0,"My wife, who’s a highly educated (and recently educated) teacher from a top 5 education program with specialization in special ed, gifted, and reading, has the following to say.

These are all false, but a few are only technically false, and many have roots in evidence-based practices, which is a possible source for the confusion.

1. Recently rigorously proven that an over-stimulating environment detracts from learning.

2. Learning styles have never had an evidence base, however it is proven as children grow into adults they can develop the ability to learn by some methods more than others. So the brain eventually wires itself to be more efficient at taking in information in the way it’s most accustomed to. This is more of a comfort factor and less of an ability factor, leading many adults to believe in the idea of “learning styles” which, especially in children, are basically bunk.

3. “Multiple intelligences” (meaning social/emotional/analytical etc.) are bunk, however if the question is read to mean “multiple intelligence levels” (meaning differentiating instruction to be appropriate for multiple stages of development) then the answer should be true, as it’s evidence based.

4. There is evidence for strong correlation between poor coordination and motor skills and slow literary development, which is why many believe this statement, but it’s been rigorously disproven that helping the motor skills problem helps the literary development.

5. Bad science. Left and right brain pseudoscience needs to die. 

6. Is indirectly true in that this can be one of many methods of calming and emotionally stabilizing children with certain disabilities. But it doesn’t work for all children with those disabilities and has no direct benefit to learning.

7. Again, left-brain/right-brain pseudoscience.

8. True only if the reading difficulty is a symptom of a physiological problem related to eyesight, and that particular eyesight problem is helped by the exercise.

9. Tribal knowledge.

10. What? Who still believes this factoid?

11. Like the sensory soothing effect of number 6, only beneficial as a method of calming and emotionally stabilizing - and no particular benefit to the music being electronically modified, just soothing.

12. The number of children *diagnosed* with autism has increased with awareness. 

13. Bunk.

14. Never heard that before.

15. Needs to die with left brain/right brain.

16. Relatively recently rigorously disproven. However there are periods where the environment required to acquire certain skills is more readily available. Like, the most beneficial environment to learn a new language is often total immersion, which is difficult to find after you learn your first language.

17. Stop.

18. Not an expert in early childhood development, but from a reading expert standpoint that’s absurd. Speech, 1:1 correspondence, and communicative phrases must come before reading. The majority of 18 month old babies cannot put together effective phrases and display 1:1 correspondence."

Hunting,fevtry2,t3_eqpn1o,1579401397.0,"Meat destruction is generally only a function of velocity. I’ve seen deer hit in the front shoulder by 45-70 Govt. rounds. Massive bullets moving slowly. It pokes a clean hole with minimal clotting and leaves big pieces of bone behind where it connects.

Anything moving at speeds in the 2500+ range is where you get the meat-shredding, clot-inducing, bone-exploding shockwave.

So really most common hunting calibers are going to ruin meat if you don’t make a clean shot. A 300WM won’t likely be much worse than a .308 if you shoot a major muscle group. 

Though I still find the .308 a more practical choice for white tails.

Edit to add: the way a big slow bullet kills is fundamentally different than how a smaller faster bullet does. 

A big slow bullet relies on a high sectional density (ability to penetrate based on weight to diameter ratio) and a lot of momentum to punch a large, tough bullet straight through creating a wound channel basically as wide as the bullet. The bullet connects with vital organs, cuts a large-diameter path, and disrupts the circulatory process leading to a loss of blood and eventually death. 

A smaller faster bullet works instead by using a lower sectional density expanding bullet which relies on the physical resistance of the target to cause expansion up to roughly the diameter of the larger bore bullets. The expanding action and lower momentum allow the bullet to slow significantly, dumping a major portion of the bullet’s kinetic energy into the surrounding tissue. In addition to being an immediate shock to an animal’s nervous system as a large deposit of kinetic energy is made into the chest cavity, this essentially liquefies all tissue within a couple of inches of the actual wound cavity, causing massive internal blood loss and vital organ dysfunction. The animal is essentially dead immediately and carries out its flight reflex in the few seconds before it expires.

On smaller thin-skinned game, the lighter faster bullet is generally preferred because it produces more rapid results. On big, tough game and dangerous game, the smaller bullet cannot he relies upon to penetrate through the non-vital tissue and expend it’s energy in the correct location, so the bigger slower bullet is generally preferred."

You can find specific examples of extremely reliable and extremely unreliable vehicles in every make and model imaginable. But that’s the problem, anecdotes are... well, anecdotal. And big-time market analyses are probabilistic... they tell you nothing about your specific car. There is no single metric which accurately conveys the reliability of a specific vehicle, it’s not an achievable thing. 

The formula to achieving the reputation for reliability is quite simple, and Toyota have mastered it. First, don’t update your cars. This means cheaper replacement parts. It’s proven fact that people are more likely to keep a car longer and complain less when it breaks if it costs less to fix. Additionally, later years within a generation are proven to break less than earlier years of the same generation to the point of this being the largest predictor of long term quality. 

Second: buy out a bunch of studies that prove your vehicle to be the most reliable based on how long people keep their vehicles. By using a metric you’ve set yourself up for, it’s easy to sell consumers on the idea of reliability, to the point where they’ll over-pay for your decade-old technology. And the only thing harder than fooling someone is convincing them they’ve been fooled, so now you’ve turned your customers into loyal preachers of your brand’s reliability, otherwise they’d have to admit to being hoodwinked.

Showerthoughts,fe27t6n,t1_fe0m8ii,1578835428.0,"I understand about the mental struggle. And it’s a difficult balance because a diet that progresses very slowly has the best benefit long term in keeping the weight off, but it can often be discouraging for very overweight people who realize that they’ll need a couple of years in some cases to get to a healthy goal at that rate. There could be some merit to the psychological benefit of seeing rapid weight loss associated with macro starving, so if it’s to work long term you must have an exit strategy out of your crash diet and into a lifestyle that’s sustainable long term. Some crash diets, like whole 30, have this built in and have been used to varying degrees of success, however the general rule of thumb is that the faster weight comes off, the more likely and more quickly it is to go back on. This is due to physiological processes involved in weight management. This leaves you with two options: to lose the weight quickly and struggle to keep it off for a long period of time, or to lose the weight over a long period of time and struggle less with maintenance. In either case, it will take a long time and lot of will power and grit for a very overweight person to reach and maintain a healthy weight, and anyone who does it is a rockstar."
Showerthoughts,fdzk11f,t1_fdx4le1,1578790914.0,"You’re over thinking it. 

It’s physically impossible to maintain or gain weight if your caloric intake is lower than your caloric output. You can measure this simply. Start eating a specific number of calories and drinking a specific amount of water each day, a couple days later weigh yourself, eat your specific number of calories and drink your specific amount of water each day for 10-14 days, then weigh yourself again. If you lost weight you were at deficit. If you did not lose weight you were even. If you gained weight you were at a surplus. The manner of intake does not matter. It could literally be 1800 calories each day from strictly eating butter all in one sitting, and it would work the same as a well-balanced diet in terms of weight loss. There is no dispute to this fact. 

The manner of intake matters in two different ways: first, it will determine whether you’re healthy or not. You might lose weight on a strict diet of 1800 calories from butter each day, but you won’t be healthy doing that. Second: it will determine whether you stay on plan or not. If your natural eating desire is to graze, and you try to go to intermittent fasting and gorge yourself on one or two big meals and starve yourself the rest of the time, you’ll break and over eat by snacking in the fast. Similarly, if you’re naturally an intermittent faster, and you try to go to a grazing diet, the urge to have that big satisfying meal will break you and you’ll over eat. 

The first concern can be addressed simply: eating a balanced diet by counting macros and eating all three in portions that make sense for your lifestyle and staying away from processed foods will make you healthier.

The second concern is a little trickier, you just have to do what you do and figure out what sort of regimen makes it easiest for you to stay in plan. Finding foods that are filling for their calorie content is also a good way to go about it. 

The big takeaways:

1. A caloric deficit will always lose weight. If you’re not losing weight, you aren’t at a deficit.

2. Never starve yourself of a macronutrient (HFLC, looking at you) because it is unsustainable and unhealthy, rather try to ingest the healthiest version of each macro that you can (whole grain over processed carbs)

3. Your regimen doesn’t matter except in that it’s keeping you on track. If you have a well balanced diet of an appropriate number of calories, you’ll get the results you want whether you eat it all at once or in 10 small meals."

The first part, however, if you get some weight right over the rear axle you can substantially improve. I don’t know what you have access to for weight, but like 300 pounds back there will do the trick. More is better.

The only possibility for American missiles to contact that plane would be air to air missiles, and Iran would be having a coronary right now (with good reason) if the US flew fighter jets over their soil and shot down a passenger plane. State run news wouldn’t be calling it a mechanical failure. 

Killing a General in a drone strike in Baghdad? That’s questionable, but American soldiers die in Baghdad a few times a year, and it’s barely news. The place is a war zone. If you go there as part of the military it’s a risk you’re taking. If it was an American General killed in a roadside bomb in Baghdad, I would think nothing of it. Shit happens.

Launching rockets at the Iraqi air bases housing US troops, that’s a pretty legitimate response to the killing of the General. It’s an attack on a military target in a war zone, nothing to get upset about.

Breakup is most likely to occur on ascent where stress on the wings and velocity are both relatively high. And would explain the loss of transponder.

A missile also explains the loss of transponder, and is a possibility, but is much much more likely to happen on a plan that is descending. Missiles are almost all down range shots, meaning that the shooter is roughly under the flight path of the target. Crossing shots are improbable hits. Tactically speaking, shooting something from the surface as it ascends gives you a much faster relative speed than something on a slight descent, so even if it’s identified as hostile aircraft or missile, it is advantageous to wait for the transition from ascent to descent to take the shot. So possible, but not likely based on geometry."
