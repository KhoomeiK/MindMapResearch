Wasnt speaking to me regularly during our long relationship.  Your bf is being a selfish, emotionally abusive prick. Your birthday was not special for you because it is not special to him. Blowing up at you for being hurt is deflecting his shitty behaviour and is an attempt to make you feel like all the drama and trauma is your fault. It is not. Your bf just doesnt think too highly of you or your feelings. I am sorry you are dealing with this bs. You have options. You are young. You do NOT have to accept his shit. At all. You can do better."

You should sit her down about the $500 gift demand, and tell her that a gift is from the heart, and discretionary. To put an expected monetary standard on a gift is very tacky, in exceedingly poor taste, bordering on greed and entitlement.  She has so far, not shown you any consideration for your financial status as a hard-working college student.
Third major thing that is really outrageous is her booking an expensive-ass country club, and just outright expecting her friends to foot a huge bill. $1,000 out of the blue? Uh, no.  She is well on her way to damaging your friendship with these demands and expectations for her friends to blindly subsidize her expensive whims. She is being ridiculous and self centered. Sit her down and go over these points with her. Write it all down first.  As far as the ugly brides maid dress, Godspeed. I have worn my share of hideous, awful-fitting, impossible to color match, over priced pieces of shit in sea foam green with hoops and mutton chop sleeves to stun an ox. I am sincerely sorry about the over priced ugly dress.  Just donate it when you are done with this matrimony rodeo. Be calm and be honest with her. She is putting unreasonable financial hardship on you. Period."

relationship_advice,fe9t4jl,t3_eo513n,1578941261.0,"When i think of this conversation and try to objectively apply it to myself and my co worker - who is a man - I cannot think of any platonic reason that co workers would text like this. I would absolutely never in a million years text flirty crap like this UNLESS I was actively in either an emotional affair or a physical affair. I think there is most certainly an emotional affair happening, and, if therenhas not yet been a sexual encounter, they are definitely going down that road. Has he been doing activity out of character for him?  Going out w the boys? Joined a gym? Out of ordinary shopping trips? All of a sudden, he is trimming his pubes or beard or ears or nose? Fucking flossing all of a sudden? Odd schedule at work all of a sudden? Hiding his phone? Etc etc???
Check his car for: pre-bought items or packages that can explain a ""shopping trip"" for that new drill. Find out about her. Run her cell number. Is she married? Get his phone while he is asleep and fucking catfish her. Print ALL OF IT out for court, if indeed it goes that way. Show up unannounced at his work. Go talk to that bitch face to face. Let her know she is not getting his dick easily or without consequence. She married? In a relationship? Wreck her and his ride.  Collect all your documents, deeds, insurance, car titles, etc. Plan carefully. Put aside cash.  I went thru this. He denied denied denied gaslighted blamed got angry gaslighted lied denied cried and finallt admitted he was fucking a woman he worked with. Yeah, girl, red flag time. Be safe. Be calm. Be smarter than them. If they are fucking, document times, places. Try to get them together. Follow his ass next time he goes to work. Borrow a friend's car he wont recognize, trade off your car right after he leaves, then follow him. WITH your cell mounted and operating as a dash cam. Get ypur evidence and proceed how you see fit. F cheaters. They are the worst, most mentally cruel assholes. Good luck. Red flags, hon. Be vigilant. Im pulling for you."

At the time, though, I was a walking hormone triggered by any thing at all. My libido was through the roof. I was insulted hurt and pissed at the time, but now, I understand it. Dont be too harsh on yourself. You are human. You WERE considering her, and your fears or discomfort in possibly hurting her or the baby are, imo, valid.  It will pass.

relationship_advice,fdku93d,t3_elrx58,1578511272.0,"What I don't get is why it took to get to the point where she is so profoundly unhappy that she is wanting to end the relationship.  That is A LOT of unhappiness.  Did you not notice that she was frustrated? Why in this day and age is the division of household chores that ALL GROWN-ASS PEOPLE should do without being asked an issue that built up resentment from her? Did she ask and ask and did you ignore or pretend it wasn't that bad???  Did you talk to her about her gripes after her cathartic drunken.anger? Not defending her drinking, but wtf? It really got to this point where leaving you is preferable to battling with you about fucking dishes and laundry?? I suspect that she has been resenting you about this for a looooong time and that you've been complacent.  Maybe I am wrong.  You may have to accept that a lot of resentment in couples literally kills the ""in love"" passion, and for some, once that resentment outweighs the love, its over...."
