However, I'm not sure if anything can be learned from this because of how fundamentally different it is from reality but I'll try to make the analogy work because I think I get what you're getting at.

If walking outside in this world means a 100% chance of rape then yes, walking outside = raped. Sort of like in our world, walking outside in the Arctic without a jacket is a 100% chance of freezing, it's irrelevant whether you consent to being frozen since choosing to walk outside with a jacket = freezing to death. 

I guess contraception would be like a gatling gun and missile equipped mech suit to fight off the infinite hordes of rapists. It can keep one safe for a while but there's always a risk that it'll break down. And since in this fictional world outside = rape is written into the law of the universe, then one's intentions are irrelevant.

The danger in relying in these fictional scenarios though is they become divorced from reality. For example, rape is an evil act but pregnancy is not. It's the same problem that makes the ""Would you save a child or embryos in a fire"" exercise not work, the world operates on the assumption that second place priority justifies mass murder when that doesn't work in our world."

Both are related to cause and effect but they're entirely different scenarios.

The sole real purpose of sex is for reproduction, pleasure can be attained in other ways. Sex in that way is attempted reproduction. It's like choosing to shooting at someone is attempted murder even if you didn't consent to the bullet piercing their body. People can't pick and choose where intentions apply if the actions are that fundamentally bonded. 

The other is being killed due to the cultural and political attitudes of a country over an arbitrary trait. It isn't even direct cause and effect.

scifiwriting,fcwfvbw,t3_eivn4r,1578024558.0,"*Buckle up kids, I've substituted for my lack of friendships and social life for complete knowledge of a hypothetical space warfare system.* 

The universe is set around 2440 so even though I want it to be harder sci-fi I accepted it'd be equally unrealistic for no new tech to pop up. 

Better tech means warfare has become much more complex and layered. Advances in armor means most military stells can take a fair amount of damage before being ruined. Most warfare is a constant balancing act between different weapons and different armor types. If you're too far then point defense systems will chew anything up well in advance, wasting precious taxpayer dollars. Too close and you'll be obliterated instantly, long before you can do anything cool. 

Coilguns that run the length of a stell have the most raw power. They're either used as a one or two shot kill or area denial/cover with certain payloads. They can fire either slugs, slugs with explosive payloads for controlled detonation, splinter rounds, or nuclear bombs for style. Smaller coilguns are used to launch missiles and smaller slugs for combat or tiny pellets for point defense. The latter requires combat logs to be intact for clean up or you're open to lawsuits. High G dodges are needed so the first fatalities in ""less advanced"" stells are the command crew members leisurely sitting around on the bridge.

Large lasers shot in pulses are used to pierce holes in armor to make way for kinetics or melt point defense/repair systems. They can also blind optics if the laser shielding is damaged. They can also be kept in a continuous stream and dragged along the shell of enemy stells, nothing demoralizes the enemy more than carving mean words into their shell. Smaller lasers are used as point defense. The use of these cause stells and missiles to constantly have to jerk around (sort of vibrating if seen from far enough way) when moving on any vector to stop the heat from building too fast. Other methods include releasing a highly reflective glitter in their way or having over heated pieces of shell to release.

Missiles are the jack-of-all-trades but slower, more expensive, and more easily countered than both. However, the wide variety of payloads make them the most versatile. They can simply ram, carry chemical/plasma explosives, carry nukes, release pellets or flechettes to shatter optics and laser lenses, release strongly worded letters, act as distractions while slower missiles sneak by point defenses, or go quiet only to spring to life and act as mines in a hectic battlefield. More specialized maneuvers like the *""Smoothie Maker""* involve implanting explosives near engines set to go off once enough acceleration is detected. For example, if the enemy stell pulls a 70 G dodge they'll detonate the control mechanisms and counter thrusters forcing them into a prolonged 110 G spin, making them into smoothies.

Gel dispensers can act as a point defense screen, be used to patch holes, or be deployed in predicted paths as mines depending on the payload. Drones can be deployed by landing missiles and either directly chew into important systems. They can also force their way into computing systems and do things like deploy viruses, scramble signals, or upload porn into the enemies crews' HUDs.

Coolant is king and losing your supply of liquid helium/hydrogen/oxygen means everyone inside will cook. Drones desperately cling to the outside shell and try to repair damage as the battle rages. Humans are in complete control of all major decisions since computers can be hacked, tricked, or jammed. Fast pace decisions like emergency dodges or point defenses are automated but by computers that learn to mimic the behavior of the assigned crew member but at high speeds. After all, pure automation is job-destroying and abhorrent. Wireless communication with anything outside your stell is impossible due to the sheer amount of radiation, microwave, and neutrino jammers along with signal hijacking drones. 

Psychological warfare is a major component too. The dominant superpower has been convincing foolish PMCs and terrorist groups that ""fighters"" are the key to space warfare. They seduce them with images of fast mini stells zipping between slow lumbering giants. The truth is they are slower, weaker, and less protected than normal sized stells and die almost immediately.

Part of God's mission for us is fighting through the sinful, evil nature of the world. Sometimes my interest in staying alive become non-existent so you have to trust in God and go through the motions for a bit until you can revive the passion for your mission.

You bring up a lot of legitimate concerns. I fully relate to your parents threatening you in response to you cutting. My dad way back when threatened to beat the shit out of me when he saw the marks on my shoulder. Normies are profoundly dumb, they don't want to figure out how to deal with this. If icy cold showers are unpleasant for you, you may want to switch to them. They gave me everything cutting does and more, and they don't trigger the normies.

Now, I'm the last person on Earth to give you advice on how to relate to another person. However, I can tell you something about that girl concerned about you. The fact she even acknowledged your existence after you had shown imperfection/""""insecurity"""" in front of her, let alone still wanted to talk to you, means you've found a treasure that many of us will never find. Don't waste it, this is something very rare.

>I still had one goal that I needed to do before I passed. Prove everyone wrong that I can do stuff they said I couldn’t

That's a superb goal. Long-lasting, infinitely renewable, morally sound, and relatable to many different life routes. I'm impressed you came up with something like so early. I never hit something like that until my early 20s. That's the type of goal that keeps you alive and successful."
