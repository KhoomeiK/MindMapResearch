I think it's a little unreasonable to expect ESL foreigners to be able to parse out the difference between for-profit not-sham universities from fake for-profit sham universities. Maintaining immigration status is very bureaucratic, idiosyncratic process that is difficult to navigate, especially in a country where a university that bears the elected president's name is sham. 

Abiding by bureaucracy is often a sham, think about wedding officiants. The Universal Life Church is a sham orginzation that thousands of people successfully use to legally officiate weddings, there is no pretense that it is a *legit* organization. Sometimes you just need a rubber stamp to abide by the letter of the law and abiding by the spirit of the law is unimportant, other times they expect you to obey both the spirit and the letter. This can be exceedingly difficult for someone who doesn't speak the language and unfamiliar with the idiosyncrasies of academia and government paperwork to navigate.

This seems hardly different to me than American students enrolling in the minimum number of credits and taking Intro to Latin Ballroom Dancing to maintain their student status. University is about jumping through hoops, doubly so on a student visa."
