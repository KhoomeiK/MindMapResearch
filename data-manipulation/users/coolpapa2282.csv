unpopularopinion,ff69hm7,t1_ff5ghg7,1579622267.0,"Or another example - imagine a math problem like ""A monthly bus pass costs 20 dollars, or single rides are 50 cents. If Michael goes to work on the bus 22 times per month and his wife makes 8 shopping trips per month, how much money should they budget for bus fare?""

To a middle-class person, you see the path to solving this. Monthly pass for the dad, 8 bucks in single fares for the mom, $28/month. To someone who's used to scrimping every penny, the thought process is like, well, my dad works the third shift, so if mom goes grocery shopping during the day after he gets home, they can split one bus pass for the month.... 

So this particular example has nothing to do with race, but it is an example of how systemic issues can keep groups of poor people poor for a long period of time. You set people behind (with Jim Crow laws, slavery, redlining, etc.) and then keep them behind with inferior schools, discouraging them from pursuing education with tests that tell them they're dumb, and here we are."

askmath,ff2ioy8,t3_er9ooa,1579507868.0,"Two things - one, you shouldn't think of piecewise functions as two different functions. This is all one function, it just happens to follow different rules depending on the inputs. It's sort like if I ask my calculator the square root of a number - if I give it a negative, it gives me an error message, but if the input is positive, it does the calculation for me. But it's a single function. 

Then, for limits, the statement that the limit of g(x) as x approaches -1 equals 1/2 means ""If x is close to -1, then g(x) is close to 1/2."" This is a true statement if x is -.9, or anything else a little bigger than -1. This is not true if x is -1.1, or anything a little less than -1. So we can't say the statement is always true, and thus that limit does not equal 1/2.

For an even less rigorous answer (but good intuition), imagine that I drew the graph of g, but I covered up the point at (-1,1/2). Then I ask a bunch of people how I should draw the point when x = -1. Some people would say with y=1/2, some people would say y = 0 (to match the left half of the graph). Since there's no one obviously correct answer, the limit does not exist."
