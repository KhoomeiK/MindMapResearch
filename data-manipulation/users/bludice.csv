tifu,fff8p6f,t1_fff627d,1579878489.0,The number of people discovering how to properly walk down stairs in this thread is hilarious.
MonsterHunterWorld,fff8iwh,t3_et8pl8,1579878368.0,This is awesome! Similar in style to Osen's Kushala portrait imo
MonsterHunter,fff8b31,t1_ffdvth9,1579878217.0,Wow was not expecting to see a DICE reference today
aww,fff78zo,t1_fff2url,1579877486.0,Ohh same. My big grey baby gave me a headbutt to the mouth while I was asleep and had severely chapped lips. The pain was sharp and definitely woke me up
funny,ff6xg06,t1_ff6pf2g,1579636881.0,"Do you mean like how the ball travels through those paths and mechanisms in the video? In that case, you can look up Rube Goldberg machines to understand that people can create these things and then just follow along with a camera."
MonsterHunterWorld,feyyr91,t1_fey6z9y,1579452142.0,It's effluvia's scientific name actually

aww,feovti5,t1_feos8b7,1579306497.0,"Yeah mine is dark gray and not blue at all. I think that may apply more to pedigree ones? I've seen ones on Instagram that are silvery to a point of almost being ""blue"" I guess."
aww,feoc48p,t1_feobmt0,1579298024.0,"Oh yes, I agree that there's no truly hypoallergenic cat, but I could have been more clear. I'm very fortunate that he worked out for me."
aww,feoauvl,t1_feo8new,1579297525.0,Yeah it's possible that's the case for me. I have also heard of a more clinical immunotherapy approach where your doctor gives you shots of the allergens periodically to boost your tolerance.
aww,feo6vwj,t1_feo61xh,1579295898.0,Aww sorry to hear this!
aww,feo1pzl,t3_eq4asy,1579293969.0,"For me it was the dander that I was allergic to for other cats. I don't get a reaction even if I bury my face into my cat's fur now, but if he nibbles on my arm or gets his claws in my leg for some reason then I do get some temporary localized swelling where he broke skin but it's really rather minor compared to how it was before. Definitely do some research and a few visits to the cat before you decide! I couldn't imagine a worse situation than bringing home a cat and bonding with them to only realize that you can't keep them."
aww,fenz08k,t1_fenojkj,1579292892.0,"Depending on how severe your allergies are, you could look at a Russian Blue. They are more on the hypoallergenic side and I haven't had any trouble with the one my boyfriend and I adopted even though I am allergic to other cats. Plus he's just a big adorable gray baby."
MonsterHunter,fekn12x,t1_fekinzb,1579203447.0,"Perhaps it wouldn't but it would be far less complicated and time consuming from a game dev perspective to design a hunter character that has a moveset representative of all weapon classes in MH rather than a hunter who can choose which weapon to use in a match that requires unique movesets for each one that is balanced. 

If they decide to make a hunter character it would be so awesome to see an ultimate smash move that uses the strongest attacks from each weapon though (TCH, cluster, etc.). Or just the fucking Dragonator. The grab could be the clutch claw too."
MonsterHunterWorld,fek4vid,t3_ephzw8,1579192656.0,I love this style! I need more pixel sprites in my life
funny,feac0jc,t3_eo7bp7,1578946824.0,Had something similar happen to me when my family was in China. We were in a bus on the highway and all of a sudden we see another bus going the opposite direction on our side of the road. Was pretty crazy to say the least.
insaneparents,fdqn7cz,t1_fdqh1wn,1578670638.0,Wtf
AskReddit,fdho100,t1_fdhm0ha,1578426702.0,*Is that a motherfucking JoJo reference?!?!!!?*
blackcats,fczwe6g,t1_fczsrcg,1578109760.0,"Yeah when he was at the shelter before I adopted him, he was bullied by other cats even though he was friendly all I can imagine he wouldn't have as good of a time at a pet daycare."
blackcats,fcyh0wc,t1_fcyg3aj,1578079978.0,Hmmm okay that's good testimony. I think I'll think twice about it and defer to have him in a more comfortable environment over the daycare. Thank you for the advice!
blackcats,fcydouo,t3_ejh7b5,1578078496.0,How do you like the extended stay daycares for your cat? I'm going to be taking some longer vacations this year and I'm trying to figure out if it's worth looking into as an alternative to having friends or coworkers help look after my little guy.
nonononoyes,fcxt61o,t3_ej8io9,1578070048.0,Glad he survived but that tent that got hit is shredded now
MonsterHunter,fcxgbc7,t3_ejc2rd,1578062189.0,He said *biiiiitch* then ran away
aww,fcs1neu,t1_fcs1e3j,1577910055.0,"Oh a dual-perspective one, very nice!"
CrossView,fckmyrc,t3_ehou47,1577728823.0,For me it made a third rectangle in the middle
