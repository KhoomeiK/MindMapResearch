AnimalCrossing,ffu81kt,t3_ev904h,1580236440.0,"I've always loved the natural/cozy aesthetic in Animal Crossing, so I may not add too much furniture outdoors. Maybe some lanterns and wood benches."
AnimalCrossing,ffu7rmd,t3_ev97co,1580236275.0,"Looks great, but are we sure that the wave crashes aren't just part of the promotional image and are actually in the game?"
AnimalCrossing,ffqt5ks,t3_euaj67,1580143056.0,"Maybe not a""minor"" detail, but someone in another thread mentioned adding a cooking/baking feature. It would be pretty different from anything we've had in Animal Crossing, give more functionality to certain furniture pieces, and just be generally adorable.

More realistically, I would like an option for weeds to not count against town happiness. I like keeping them to add detail and texture to the terrain, it's a shame that the games just consider them as trash."
ACPocketCamp,ffffz9c,t3_et69e3,1579883130.0,"Yeah, I kinda stopped playing Pocket Camp because I got so frustrated with the LT/fortune cookie system. The event items are cute and fun, but you have to play the game semi-constantly to get even a few of them. Way too grindy."
fatlogic,ff4edhs,t1_ff38faa,1579561615.0,"I am beyond baffled by this, too.

Wait, can I say that it's cultural appropriation for HAES people to eat white sugar and white flour? Then we might get somewhere with them in the weight loss department..."
fatlogic,ff4e2db,t1_ff2xjue,1579561409.0,"Brb gotta play ""woke bingo"" with my University's bulletin board posts."
fatlogic,ff4d9v3,t3_erdeb4,1579560885.0,"I'll add a story to the comment pile. My mom was born with a congenital birth defect that caused the bone structure of her foot to be slightly misshapen. At 16, she ""sprained"" her ankle (which she found out YEARS later was a fracture) and developed a heel spur. All kinds of shit.

She was always obese when I was a kid and used her foot as an excuse not to exercise. This year, when she cut sugar and carbs, she started losing weight and could finally exercise. She's down 40 lbs, her foot is barely a problem anymore, and I couldn't be more proud of her."
AnimalCrossing,ff3ar1f,t1_ff383jj,1579537547.0,"No, I usually prefer playing as the only villager. However, I do try to create areas of the town based on the books (the Cherry tree outside the East window, the Violet Vale, Haunted Woods, etc.)"
AnimalCrossing,ff2walk,t3_er9c79,1579526579.0,"I  usually name my town Avonlea (as my username suggests, I'm a big fan of Anne of Green Gables). This will work even better in ACNH, since Avonlea is supposed to be on Prince Edward Island."
fatlogic,felves7,t1_fekutyr,1579231901.0,"Congrats on taking responsibility and making change. It's reassuring to know other people struggle with this and that we're not alone... I have severe depression, and sugary drinks have been my key coping mechanism ever since I was a kid. I just kept a coke or three at my desk at all times to dull whatever negativity I felt. Since starting college, I have been within walking distance of as much soda and Starbucks as I could drink. I too gained 40 lbs over the course of 2 years. Right now I'm down 17 lbs and have a long way to go, but comments like yours remind me of why I'm determined to change. Thank you, and keep at it!"
TumblrInAction,fedcyaa,t1_fecr5nf,1579007974.0,Right? It's odd this post is specifically aimed at poc women.
TumblrInAction,fedcsdt,t1_feci3c3,1579007827.0,"Yep. One of my college roommates was Irish, with the Gaelic name Ciara (KEER-uh). Nearly all her professors called her ""See-AIR-uh."" She eventually just answered to it.

If she wasn't white, I gurantee someone would have reported it to Diversity & Inclusion Initiatives."
mildlyinfuriating,fecj7z5,t3_eo9ppt,1578975228.0,My French exam asked me to name a river in France. I blanked and wrote the Danube. What I'm saying is that geography and Americans don't mix.
LuLaNo,fecinca,t3_eodjzv,1578974840.0,A never-ending nightmare
heck,fe9ld5t,t1_fe6hjqd,1578939056.0,So is Animal Crossing. This is heaven.
AnimalCrossing,fdkcj28,t1_fdk5y70,1578500988.0,"Thank you for answering! That's... really odd though, lol. I feel bad for the hardcore Canadian Animal Crossing fan who wins one of these, but sucks at math."
AnimalCrossing,fdk1mmu,t3_elmahm,1578493818.0,"Congrats! 

Quick question though: why  on earth do they need you to do math to get the bag?"
AnimalCrossing,fctcy6t,t3_eicbif,1577939352.0,"See, personally, I wouldn't even mind the fortune cookie system as long as you could somehow prevent getting repeat items like that."
RoastMe,fcpbwvc,t3_ei4wns,1577857618.0,You look like the guy who gets killed off first in the war movie.
TumblrInAction,fcpa728,t3_ei7id1,1577855871.0,I also hate that she's putting down what's making the other woman happy. There's nothing wrong with getting together with friends over margaritas. Jeeze. Let people live their lives.
PublicFreakout,fcn72f4,t1_fcmy7sc,1577804965.0,"Don't disrespect her rich heritage as a Hamburger-American.

Her calorie consumption is not your goddamn prom dress."
PublicFreakout,fcn6x4u,t1_fcn6fl0,1577804855.0,They had to give her a Karen sacrifice to ensure a plentiful harvest.

AnimalCrossing,fcl01ws,t1_fckrvmq,1577736874.0,"I definitely see this transition. I played the Gamecube version religiously as a kid, and just got New Leaf for Christmas. Overall the ACNL villagers/NPCs are a lot softer and sweeter than those of the Gamecube version. Not as snarky or prone to insulting you.

Personally, I loved the older rude villagers, but I could see why others would find them off-putting."
