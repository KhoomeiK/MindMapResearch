I disagree. The 1.6.2 update removed the 30 degree limit on rotations, meaning Index players no longer need to wait for sabertailor to update, in order to play this game :D"
privacytoolsIO,fdrtiq1,t3_emq9cg,1578689543.0,"> [The Brave team] believe[s] this is because the user-agent string currently reported by Brave on iOS contains an old version number. As a result, Facebook believes the user's browser is a soon-to-be unsupported version of Firefox. Facebook does not seem to be trying to target Brave users directly.

Why? Cause they changed the saber settings to allow for a higher rotation than 30°. Something the community requested when the last update dropped. This shows that the devs do listen to feedback <3"
