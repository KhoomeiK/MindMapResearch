ABoringDystopia,fex9naq,t1_fewoedr,1579427329.0,"I worked at a daycare (actually I was volunteering i national service) when I was younger, tried to call in sick, they told me to come in anyway. I come in, they look at me and see I really do have a fever, and tell me to go home. So I had to wait for the bus and go home."
