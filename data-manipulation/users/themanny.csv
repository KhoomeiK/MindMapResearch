Nanny,fe6p9ns,t1_fe6n1et,1578899113.0,"Also watching 4 children with no wage increase in two years.
Experience in general is golden...experience with their four should be even more valuable to them.

I don't see why being 14 makes the responsibility any less valuable."
Nanny,fe6p3qc,t1_fe6ji0u,1578898914.0,"Been a nanny in Houston for 25 years...yeah...That would be crazy low. Even for babysitting vs nannying that isn't enough for four younglings. 

Your age is not that terribly important in that you have 2+ years with them and that is just too low. It's taking advantage of you.

Tell them you are starting to prepare for your future and while you love helping them out and you would love to stay and help when they need, as you are starting to become an adult you are going to begin to have adult expenditures and that requires a more realistic income."

The dog hated the ups guy with an unholy passion, however. He tried treats and she wouldn't accept them. Maybe he smelled weird."

AmItheAsshole,fcolbno,t1_fcnp97t,1577835113.0,"Been a nanny for 25 years and you get what you pay for. Babysitting and nannying.

I also babysit for family and very good friends but they know even if I don't ask for money then beer as a thank you afterwards is never frowned upon...but they know I do this for a living and never try to skimp. They know exactly what they can expect with me to care for their kids.
