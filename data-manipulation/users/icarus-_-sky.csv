Android,ff9ii5w,t1_ff9g68g,1579713736.0,The US networks don't all work on the same bands; Verizon makes it extremely difficult to use standard unlocked/international versions of phones.
polyamory,ff8vbmi,t1_ff84gc6,1579697323.0,Do you have any actual sources for this claim? I'd love to read some
polyamory,ff6fna9,t1_ff5eavb,1579626162.0,"This is a good way to put it, time together and free time. It's time to have a conversation and setting expectations about deliberate time together."
Breadit,ff30468,t1_ff2wa9m,1579530062.0,"I've seen those recipes here and there but never tried them.

However, one thing that fucked me up early on was using tap water provided by the city. The treatment chemicals they used killed off the bacteria I wanted and it never grew. Moved to a place with well water and it worked splendidly. If this sounds like might have happened to you, try bottled water instead."
Breadit,ff25i7p,t1_ff2315z,1579494374.0,"Sourdough starter (judging by the fact that this is a boule I'm guessing that's what it is) is nothing but flour and water left to sit. Simple as that. Easiest yeast ever (except not really, timing is everything with sourdough. You need to feed the starter on a regular basis and use it at specific times in it's feeding cycle for best results)."

todayilearned,felaf4g,t1_fel4f1l,1579217585.0,An ex of mine worked for the auction house that handled that sale. They have an INSANE amount of money stashed in comics at that place. The dude who bought most of that collection (and is their biggest client) is some douchebag prince in Saudi Arabia.
personalfinance,fejs7a8,t1_fejqprw,1579184547.0,"Lol, I'd love to know what country you live in where businesses don't prey on people and provide services out of the goodness of their hearts. Because here in Capitalism Central, USA, this never happens."

TheHobbit,fego59o,t3_eoua9y,1579098496.0,"I love how people here are trying to come up with some legitimate theory, as if the movies weren't just a shitshow of a cash grab that didn't give a fuck about the actual plot."

todayilearned,febdeuk,t1_feb3nul,1578957667.0,"It sounds like it's written by a Westerner but that's pretty accurate. Driving in India, for a Westerner, is *terrifying.* Hell, any kind of travel, even on foot. Crossing the road is nuts."

AskReddit,fds8lk3,t1_fdqs9ma,1578696826.0,"I too have a Maine Coon mix, named Napkins. He's stolen an entire slice of pizza from my hands and scarfed it before I could get him back. Same with a sandwich once. He regularly eats a whole bagel when he can nab one. Thankfully we've trained him decently, so he sits at the table in the chair with his face just above the table waiting for his turn to eat. He's a good old boy."

electronic_cigarette,fdkhr4p,t1_fdkfqne,1578504119.0,"Agree to disagree. There are FAR more important issues at stake in the upcoming election. If you find it acceptable to sacrifice basic human rights, keeping war off American soil, the possibility of authoritarian despotism so you can keep your flavors, you have that right, just as I have the right to call you a fucking moron for it."
