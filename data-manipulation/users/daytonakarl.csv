He's less drama than one of my dogs, but a little more than the other one, they are social creatures so if you're interested in getting one then they'll need a constant companion.

Eats pretty much anything, a little fussy which is surprising, likes dog biscuits, phone charger cables, most vegetables, and once stole my piece of chicken, pigs can laugh by the way...
