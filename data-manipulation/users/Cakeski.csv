news,fdtk7l6,t1_fdsjoji,1578717949.0,"In 2016 UK Prime Minister David Csmerom buckled to pressure from Eurosceptics to declare a  non binding referendum on whether or not the UK should leave the European Union. 

They voted 52 to 48% to leave. Mainly due to people believing a lie on a red bus and a lot of dismissal of facts as ""part of project fear""

Cameron realised the jig was up, resigned. The Conservative party had a vote on a new leader and Theresa May was the only one left running to take the reigns. 

May wants to solidify a conservative lead for a  'strong and stable brexit' and calls a General Election. She loses several seats and labour and the opposition gain a fair few. (KEK). 

For 2 years she tries to write out and agree on a  deal with her party and spends 2018 and 19 extending the time with the EU for a deal and then tries to shove the deal through parliament...3 times. Parliament wants to find the best method for brexit and vote on 7 ways, including no deal...
None of the methods get a  majority.

Summer of 2019. May steps down. Conservatives now look for another leader. Boris is voted as leader by the Conservatives and wants to 'get Brexit done'. He now has to redo a deal with the EU and the parliament agree to a second reading, but nkt to his schedule,  forcing him by law to extend the deadline to Jan 31 2020. 

This in turn leads to Boris wanting a  general election, opposition not wanting it and then wanting it. A  vote in parliament leads to a general election on Dec 12 2019.

Conservatives gain majority, labour and opposition lose seats. All but the SNP who gain more and want Scotland to remain in the EU.

Come 31st Jan. The UK begins separation with EU, but trade talks and a deal need to be agreed upon.

The Cons outweigh the pros for leaving the EU in terms of trade and travel as a  lot of costly paperwork could end businesses who trade with the EU."
