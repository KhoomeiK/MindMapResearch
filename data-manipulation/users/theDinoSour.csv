Let's test this out with your example of owing money...

I should pay my bills

I do pay my bills

Are you honestly trying to tell me those statements mean the same thing?  

The first implies that paying my bills is the right thing to do.
The second means I actually do pay my bills."
gaming,ff7j6eo,t1_ff7igbu,1579650796.0,"Nah, I'm challenging you to think more objectively.

You're not going to address that last point  of my previous comment are you?  Where's your evidence?

What you don't even realize is that I actually lean towards agreeing with the strategy that society and individuals 'should' strive towards that behaviour, but this is separate from the concept of entitlement. Go look up what entitled means; it deals with inherent privileges and nature doesn't inherently imply any sort of privilege.  It's a strategy of behaviour invented by humans."
gaming,ff7gcc8,t1_ff6qngb,1579648905.0,"I think there is a disconnect here, you're saying 'do' when you mean 'should'... or misunderstanding the concept entirely.

It seems you're not using the term 'irony' correctly either.  I'm taking the null position that the concept of entitlement is not a universal constant, so I'm not making any claims in opposition to what is expected.

If you feel entitlement is some inherent force of nature, what is your evidence for this?  Are there other social species that exhibit this behaviour?"

Their fact is separate from how we 'ought' to live in terms of what strategies might be more effective for survival.  But make no mistake, it is a strategy, not some universal constant.

You cannot prove any sort of entitlement, it's a concept contrived by humans."

From a sales and marketing perspective, delays to market can allow competition to take some profits (if there are competing products), and also affect quarterly revenue/profit goals, which are performance objectives from stockholders.

Not sure if first one applies, but second one almost always does and the reason most shit is shoved out there in the first place."

From a male perspective, some of us find it attractive when women don't resign themselves as the ones to be chased.  It's only been 2 days, life could have gotten hectic and dude is still genuinely interested.  

Don't be overbearing, but reach out if you are feeling it.

Is it possible he just said he had a nice time because that is standard, absolutely.  However, I wouldn't risk the opportunity though if you dig this person, worst that happens is he doesn't reply, you move on.... alternative is you miss out on what might have been.  Give yourself the piece of mind."

IAmA,fdnqmwl,t3_emb3u8,1578590968.0,"Can you provide some suggestions as to how to provide a safe environment where kids can be vulnerable to ask questions and honestly describe how they feel with each parent?

I recently started seeing someone that is admittedly in a high conflict co-parenting situation and it is affecting the kids, one more so than the other.  She mentions that it seems like her older son (9yo) is afraid to talk about it out of fear of retaliation from the other parent.  She mentions the older child's personality more resembles her own and the ex treats him differently.

I've always had a very amiable and productive co-parenting relationship with my ex so I have no experience with this.  Although I know I am there to mainly listen, I still have this urge to try and support her more with some ideas.  She mentions that previous attempts to provide professional counseling seemed to add its own layer of stress for the child.  What are some next steps in a situation like that?"

datingoverthirty,fckh3we,t1_fck3s4q,1577725196.0,"She makes some good points but is wrong on the whole 'choose to/need to' topic, claiming only medical issues are important. 

Nonsense....be there for your kid first, you don't have to use it as an excuse for everything and abuse it, but making it to your kid's game or play, recital, or whatever is a 'need to' in my book.  Your kid needs to know you support them and are proud of them and actions are key here, not just saying it.  Go to their events, cheer for them, it's important for their mental health/confidence, and teaching them how to be a good parent if they choose to one day.

Unfortunately, sometimes only a parent can understand this and why I rarely even bother dating women without their own child.  Not saying it's impossible, but improbable.

Lastly, childless partners have every right to want that attention, but will likely need to find someone that can actually give it to them without affecting a child."
atheism,fc6ub0b,t1_fc6qhwn,1577489684.0,"Humans don't 'deserve' anything, just like every other life form out there.  We invented the concept of morality and there really aren't any rules except those that we impose to make our quality of life more comfortable with less suffering.

You want 'humane' treatment, you can earn the privilege by being civilized.  You repeatedly commit these atrocities against civilization and into the meat grinder you go.  Personally, I don't agree with wasting resources to rehab certain humans that are too far gone.  There are plenty of non-violent or less violent humans that can get that funding and resources instead.

Maybe one day we can get to 100%, but those ideals are really far out and our empathy and resources would probably be better spent elsewhere.  The child sex offenders and murderers can be the first to go and the last to get help.  When we've taken care of the rest, maybe one day we solve that problem....but by that time I would assume we've already prevented them from committing those atrocities in the first place.  Definitely won't be happening in our lifetimes, but it's theoretically not impossible.  

Edit:. ...and I completely agree, murder in self defense is a different context and I'm not trying to paint a broad stroke when it comes to that."
