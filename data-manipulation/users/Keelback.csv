AskReddit,fgioub6,t1_fghwpyu,1580827489.0,"A stranger murdering a person is rare. For USA and I think most of the  world, the victim know their killer ([80 % in USA](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/press/MILUC88.PR) and [75% in Australia](https://www.crimestats.aic.gov.au/NHMP/1_trends/#homicideType)).

It is tragic however in Oz, 40% are domestic (35% acquaintance). Unfortunately it is mostly a male killing their female partner. 

So if you to stay safe in a bothie, don't take family or friends. :)"
AskReddit,fg9j6t3,t1_fg6of8z,1580639440.0,"I visited London late 2018 and I was surprised at the sheer number of shop assistants who were not British and, to be quite honest, spoke poor English. I'm Aussie so my English is not bad. Brexit was all over the news so I checked what the [immigration figures](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50658968) were for UK. These figures are from BBC last year. Most of the immigrants come from non-European countries. Howrver I understand how British could be frustrated at their government as Australian government does the same."

So try Witcher 3. Much more believable.

Either that or replay GTA3. My favourite."

AskReddit,ffws82s,t3_ev67eq,1580309760.0,"OK I'm game. No one has mentioned the biggest and most significant myth or is it myths. That is the belief in a supreme being, creator deity, omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent and as having an eternal and necessary existence. More usually called god. However there are other names. I  know I am going to get lot of hate mail for this however I think it should be discussed.

Do please hear me out. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religions_and_spiritual_traditions), there are approximately 4,200 religions. Now that may or may not then mean that there are 4200 or there about higher beings however surely all these religions are not all  following/believe in the one god so surely it follows that the vast majority are myths.

I am not going to select any god/s to claim that he/she/it is a myth however how about discussion around the sheer number of these 'gods' for want of a better word and the problems that they have caused.

I'm ex-Catholic and I know that it has caused quite a few problems. Trying to be a little less upsetting how this how about [The Spanish Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition) as one of many that springs to mind."

He shortened World War One and saved thousand of lives, not just Australian. British, Canadian and America troops. British commanders did not plan their actions. They simply relied on sheer numbers of troops to win a battle thus costing thousands of lives. Monash planned his actions in detail ensuring victory and saving troops. Australia owes him a huge debt for what he did for us. The last soldier knighted by the King on a battlefield."
