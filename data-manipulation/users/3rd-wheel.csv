classicwow,fggwbak,t1_fggsmv1,1580771002.0,There's always one good player per dungeon. And one stoner. And one guy who didn't learn any spells because he is saving for his mount.

&#x200B;

My armies usually consists of 2/5 Nord infantry, 2/5 Vaegir Archers and 1/5 assorted cav. I go to the Sarranids to recruit archers if I am at war with the Vaegirs. I go to Rhodoks if I am at war with the Nords and need infantry. I love using slavers as cav since they use blunt weapons and you can earn a fortune ransoming off troops."

I remember when I was a kid and went to a flea market at my school. They had a computer there for sale and it was turned on. I checked it out and found commander Ken on it. Bought 1 floppy disk for next to nothing, copied the game over, then went home to play. That was my first ever pirated game I guess."

Guild2,fejs3j3,t1_fejo5ts,1579184473.0,"Yeah. In one earlier game I did (also as rogue) I killed a princess in the streets of Hamburg after a failed kidnapping attempt. She hated my guts and was racing through the ranks in the council so she had to be stopped. I'm sure there were tons of evidence pointing to me, but there were zero consequences."
RimWorld,fegjrf6,t1_fegfaen,1579094890.0,"Yeah. Never use the ""Anything"" rule. Make your own, and you'll also need to specify what material to use. My pawns refused to wear their Panthera Fur dusters and preferred frigging patchleather."

Guild2,fefal7y,t3_d7vyis,1579052073.0,"I've had great success with the rogue. It's probably the easiest class in the game. I start out with the pub and the smugglers hole, set my character to serve drinks while my girls sell salacious services and my pickpockets rob the village/town blind. I avoid the robbers camp because it's a bit too overt for my liking. The mercenary camp requires a bit of micromanagement so I build it later when i have a wife with a legit source of income. In the ""mid game"" I use them as my personal army (edit: along with my henchmen), supplied with weapons and armor from my wifes smithies."

classicwow,fdmqz1d,t1_fdldgp3,1578561448.0,That is my absolute favorite weapon in the game.
starcitizen,fdio6y0,t3_ekt7vc,1578447292.0,"For multi crew mining/cargo ships, what would be a fair way to split profits between the crew to make sure they are happy and willing to go on future missions with you, but also keep enough yourself to cover fuel, the cost of the ship and whatnot?


Note that I don't own the game yet, but I'm following development closely and am eager to get into the game as soon as I get the hardware to run it. I'm just very curious and interested in this aspect of the game"
