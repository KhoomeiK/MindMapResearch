As far as the movie itself. I found it traumatic to watch. It’s the story of a impoverished woman getting fucked over by a horrible man, she then refuses to save herself out of sheer stubbornness resulting her being hung in front of her son.

I would be curious to hear you elaborate on that a little more - you say it as if it is a given that we should do so, but why do you think we should be so generous with someone who is a known misogynist, abuser of power, and who has committed long term sexual harassment?

Why should we be so generous to his work and ""separate the art from the artist""?

bjork,ff20icv,t3_eqz6cc,1579490549.0,"**tl;dr I think we need to come to terms with the fact that Dancer in the Dark is a the creation of a misogynist, and that misogyny fundamentally shaped that movie.**

As I mentioned in my longer comment, I (personally) was traumatized by the movie.

I still can’t listen to the (brilliant) soundtrack. I guess this is almost like an extremely mild case of PTSD for me.

I think Selma wouldn’t have been so stupid and stubborn to the point of harming her family. She would have been smarter, Björk would have made her smarter if Lars hadn’t stopped her.

I don’t buy it.

It’s not realistic that someone would let themselves be walked over like that and send themselves to be executed just to obey a ridiculous request from man who fucked her over. She would have lived for the sake of her son, she wouldn’t have been stupid enough to throw her life out after all she had done for her son. She wouldn’t have been stupid enough to think that as long as her son had the surgery her life was worthless to him.

I can’t suspend my disbelief.

It’s a misogynistic fantasy.

I would bet $100 that Lars Von Trier masturbated to that movie.

Women are not as foolish as Lars Von Trier portrays them to be.

Lars Von Trier stripped Selma of her deeper intelligence.

Björk tried to make Selma strong and more intelligent, but Lars wouldn’t let her. Her acting was brilliant, music was brilliant, but even she was unable to fix the underlying problem. Björk and lars clashed and unfortunately, I think she lost.

That’s why she wanted to leave, that’s why she later stated she regretted it."
bjork,ff1z22h,t3_eqz6cc,1579489497.0,"“It comes down to separating art from the artist .”
I think there is a good debate to be had here IF and HOW we should try to do so.

I personally recognize that the film  is well crafted and the acting was good.

Of course the soundtrack is incredible, but I have a hard time listening to it after being traumatized watching the movie. 

I personally felt emotionally damaged after watching it, It’s the first time I left a movie wondering if the director was out to emotionally assault their audience.

Also, I have heard that Lars Von Trier has been accused of having a fetish of the “tortured woman”  and that all the suffering of women in films serves no purpose other than to be his misogynistic masturbation fodder.

I feel like Björk was trying to save Selma from that fate, and when she realized she couldn’t, it just made everything all the more awful for her. She has clearly stated she regrets making the film and only stuck it out out of respect for the other actors.

I can’t claim to know what his true motivations are, but these notions feel extremely plausible to me.

What do you think about those ideas?

Aside from the high production value, what value do you think the film has?
Do you think this film has enough value of its own to merit separating the artist from the art?


I don’t want to push a specific answer, but I do think that these are the kind of questions we need to ask with a problematic work like this."

On that note, can you explain one more thing to me?

I watched ""The Devil Has a Part-Time Job"" because it was on the flow chart sent to me by the auto-moderator.

Having worked in Japan for so long, I really found it entertaining and very funny, especially with its lots of subtle parodies of everyday life in Japan.

BUT I did NOT like that there was one character who was an underage high school girl who spoke with an overly-cutesy voice, had a crush on one of the main characters and had massive breasts that were often flopped around unnecessarily.  I have a vague understanding that this a common trope in Anime, but I feel a little repulsed and confused.

Can you explain this to me? Is this just masturbation fodder to perverts put in for the purpose of making the show more profitable, or is there something more going on that I don't understand?

Any life that evolved while it was a main-sequence star would have been totally burned out when it swelled into a giant, but red giants are so unstable they don't really offer good conditions for life to evolve even in the new potentially habitable zones.
