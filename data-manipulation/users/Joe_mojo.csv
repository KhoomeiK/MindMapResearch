Are you expressing your feelings in a healthy way or are you feeling sorry for yourself and being complacent? 

I’m currently in a shitty situation at the moment with no quick fix to get out of it. It’s easy to get depressed but life has taught me that the best way for me to fight off depression is constant movement. Momentum. Keep working towards something and keep improving yourself.

Oh and to add to the friends thing. Friends are great. But do your best to surround yourself with positive people. Do NOT willing place yourself in a toxic environment.

Edit: Oh and the grades thing. I had shitty grades for a LONG time. And it really brought me down. Turns out that a late diagnosis of ADHD helped me turn my grades around. I’m not saying that you might have ADHD but going through that experience taught me a lot. My mantra is to give it my all. But also be kind to yourself. Love yourself. And it’s much easier to be kind to yourself at the end of the day when you know you gave it everything. It’s all you really can do."

I try to keep my mind busy by listening to podcasts that teach me stuff too. Finances, investing, and politics if you don’t mind it. Shout out to David Pakman, Graham Stephen, and Destiny. No problem man. Stay up."
getdisciplined,fdpnbkf,t1_fdpmu07,1578633575.0,"I find myself alone a lot of the time. So I like to listen to podcasts that are very lighthearted and people just joking around and shooting the shit. For example; Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend, The Brilliant Idiots Podcast, Tigerbelly, Riffin with Griffin, and the Ten Minute Podcast. They really help me laugh and just be in the moment. I don’t feel alone during these podcasts. It’s really helping me keep my head down and dig myself out of this rut."
