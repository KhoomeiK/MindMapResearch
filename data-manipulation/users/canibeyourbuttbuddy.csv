anime,ff959ca,t1_ff6njz0,1579705156.0,i thought as a movie the plot was nonsensical and the characters undeveloped. i actually didnt think it was realistic at all (side characters' motives and behaviors were bizarre). it obviously touches on a very interesting and unique topic (ex-bully reconnecting with deaf victim on a path to redemption) but besides that as a movie i think it fails in so many basic aspects

i don't know what about WWY was slice of life to you but just because something is slow it doesn't mean it has good pacing either. i actually think WWY didn't spend enough time on the slice of life parts - if it did, it wouldve been a better movie for me"

anime,ff7is1e,t1_ff64vxj,1579650525.0,"I'm not trying to argue - just want a discussion so i can better understand how you think TnK/WWY was better written, better directed, better paced.

Better written how? IMO the story was boring compared to YN, there was not as much character development, not as many memorable interactions between the main love interests, barely developed side characters and the dialogue was cringe at times (I did not feel that way about YN)

Better directed how? IMO YN had much better music AND sound editing, and YN had more beautiful scenes and dynamic animation (in the literal sense - when counted). YN had better use of color and contrast. TnK/WWY had so many still frames with nothing going on, or a still frame where they just zoomed in on/panned across. 

Better paced how? TnK/WWY was boring to me and i was sitting in the theatre waiting for something to happen. And when finally something happens, I found myself questioning character motives like, why did he do this? why is she doing that? YN did not give me any room for doubt bc i think the pacing was tight and well timed"

nobody wants to be served by a sommelier who is allergic to wine. if you are actually physically incapable of watching something, maybe you should consider not wasting your breath criticizing it since you literally can't add value to the conversation.
