I don't like myself for saying it but I kinda think they do.  Without his record company Pharrell wouldn't be making the crazy amount of money he has been making.

I have to show up for work in order to get paid.  I'm definitely okay with others having to do the same.  I know unless people pay for music it's tricky for new artists to make a living but that's always the case when you make something niche be it music or physical goods.
