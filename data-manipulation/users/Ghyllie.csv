Look closely - she's not there in the first pic, she IS there in the second, and she IS there in the third, she's just not in the middle of the aisle or door or whatever, she right off the aisle like she's even with the first seat.  She's hard to see, but she IS there, and I THINK she's a fleshy.  I think the ghosts are the see-through group that's sitting in the seats."

roughcollies,ff6dysm,t1_ff63wmg,1579625116.0,"She's really lovely.  You might want to see what she looks like at 6 months (the minimum age for showing) and take her to watch a show and let a couple of handlers look at her.  Unless she does a complete 180 I'm certain someone would be interested in handling her for you.  She's got beautiful bone in her front legs, too!  A really exciting puppy!"
