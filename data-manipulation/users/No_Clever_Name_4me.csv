You are talking about something that has been tried in some form or another throughout recent history. Each time something(s) has gone wrong. It is insanity to think that any system will not be gamed in someway. Both by the people in charge and by the people it 'helps'. My statement about dissent  rings very true as it demonstrates this point as it basically amounts servitude or worse if you disagree. 

So please understand (without that cloud of hubris, mind you) that some are quite oblivious or even accepting to the chains around them and craft solutions accordingly. Then there are those that seek what causes those chains and strive to craft solutions that makes those chains ineffective.

Try to find a solution that does not add another chain to a human beings life and for fucks sake keep the goddamn government out of it.
