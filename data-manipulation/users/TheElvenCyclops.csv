you have every right to be frustrated at not being able to eat what you want, and it was a dick move for your family to throw away your food without your permission, and it was wrong for your mom to look through your bag and throw away your chips. but you shouldn't have lashed out at your sister like that. going on a diet is a difficult thing and she's probably self-conscious about her weight. you aren't 'ungrateful' but I think you owe your sister an apology and should have a talk with your family about meal planning to see if they could start making more food that you like along with the healthy food for your sister."
cats,fdw24v2,t3_en69wh,1578754208.0,"I'm sorry, OP, I lost a cat to cancer too. losing a fluffy friend is never fun, I just focused on the fact that he's not in pain anymore and I did my best to give him a long and happy life. I went to a nearby shelter and hung out with the animals there (And later brought one of them home). the world goes on and the best we can do is keep the dead in our memories."

She's complaining about how it's her 'final year of high school'? what about half of this other girl's time in high school that she made worse? bullying can really screw with other people, she needs to get knocked down a peg if she thinks she can get away with this kind of crap. it's a little sad she won't get to go to her senior prom but otherwise, the party ban is more than reasonable."
AnimalsBeingBros,fdvw1cg,t3_en5fe6,1578752259.0,what a good girl. It looks like she loves her job!
cats,fdvvsfx,t3_en1vnn,1578752140.0,Glad you find the little guy! 2 months is a long time to be missing him and he looks happy to be home!

sit her down and show her photos of accidents that are confirmed to have been caused by texting and driving. this crap gets people killed and the 'Everyone does it' excuse isn't good enough."

sounds like a horribly toxic relationship and you should have a talk with your husband about cutting them off permanently"
AmItheAsshole,fdlhnpz,t3_elv1j8,1578524227.0,"Are your aunt and uncle upset because they don't support gays? or did they want to have that conversation with her themselves? either way, NTA, you were asked a question and you answered it, you didn't know how your family would react and they weren't paying attention/ willing to answer it themselves."

you've made it clear you're not attracted to him and have no intention of taking your relationship any further, he needs to respect that. the fact that he doesn't realize/acknowledge that he's stepped way out of line and made you very upset and uncomfortable speaks volumes about his character. if he truly values your friendship he'll accept he made you upset and try to fix things. it's normal for people to have sexual fantasies and be attracted to other people, but to push those fantasies on others and try to pressure them when they've already expressed their disinterest is not normal in the slightest, it's creepy and wrong."

you paid for them, they're yours. if she really has this much trouble with eating I hope she gets some help if she's not getting any already. an addiction is not an excuse for theft, if she thinks it is then you need to sit down with her and make it clear that she can't pull this on you anymore and it won't be tolerated anymore. good luck to the both of you and I hope your mom gets the help she needs."

You can't be expected to sit around twiddling your thumbs waiting for him to show up, you waited for a long time and got no response when you tried to contact him. leaving when you've been waiting for an inordinate amount of time isn't selfish, it's common sense. if he knew you were waiting for him he could have borrowed a friend's phone to let you know about the situation. IMO this guy needs to scoot on out of your life."

God forbid someone have a medication prescribed to them by a medical professional and keep it in the same place most people keep their medications! I don't know what your family is thinking blaming you/ your wife. this guy came into your house, sifted through and stole your property, and somehow it's your fault?"
