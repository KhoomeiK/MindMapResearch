SpaceXLounge,ffhhhn6,t3_etf4d4,1579935453.0,Oof gonna look a little silly when they ultimately change it again. I would've waited till they did orbital tests with the full stack. Although I persoanlly liked the Futurama inspired version the best.

Futurology,fff0x8e,t1_ffeyiy6,1579872628.0,"Instead of complaining about something we all are burdened with, focus on what should be changed. Taxes are essential for the fabric of our society: roads, schools, hospitals, defense etc. Your qualm shouldn’t be that you pay it but rather that others aren’t paying their fair share (or at all) and it is being mishandled. People mischaracterise billionaires wealth in the form in which it takes I grant that but it is not lost on anybody that they do not pay enough regardless."

AskReddit,feyqta1,t1_feyo7co,1579449382.0,I think the internet will help us in regards to taking in information in a more manageable and bite sized manner. Whereas before it was all complicated and wordy manuals - videos can be readily available for a variety of things. So while I think you’re right for what’s happened in the past. Perhaps it won’t be so prevalent in the future.

SpaceXLounge,feqx44c,t1_feqw2gc,1579347064.0,I think they're rich person's hair plugs. Take the healthy hair around the back where you don't care as much if it's thinner there and then plant them around the front. You have to shave everything down and your head has a lot of red spotted scabs. But it's pretty good. It's basically an evenly distributed form of balding instead of one area that spreads. Similar to female balding.

Increase capacity with larger volume tanks - increase power output with more stacks. They also last ‘forever(tm)’. Just gotta stir it a bit to keep the electrolyte mixed properly every so often. Would assume it’d last as long as the material that houses it. Some large scale demonstrations in China. 

But yes as you said, hydroelectricity is THE best energy storage to date. Simple, beautiful. To make more though, we have to disturb a lot of people and ecological habitats - not good.
