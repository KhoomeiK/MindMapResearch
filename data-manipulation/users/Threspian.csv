AskReddit,ffjqqrl,t1_ffi5ha0,1580004516.0,IIRC the script called for the line to be “I’m pregnant.” He legitimately didn’t know that it was going to happen.
briandavidgilbert,ffhl5cg,t1_fffulmj,1579940408.0,I like that all Eeveelutions and babies got an immediate -2 in the guilt column
AskReddit,ffhgheb,t1_fffjkv5,1579934213.0,"My dragons are intelligent enough to be companions (like when your pet kind of picks up on what you’re feeling or saying or understands how to communicate their own wants/needs to you). Once they have a human they like they form a sort of “familiar” type bond where you understand each other on that level and are devoted to keeping each other healthy and safe. (Think Appa or Toothless, where they clearly recognize and love their humans and the affection is very much mutual.) 

The horse sized one is like a big cat, it’s sort of regal but once you recognize how it shows affection you understand that it sees you as it’s family, like it’ll nuzzle it’s head into your shoulder when you say hi to it in the morning and stuff. The little one one that I would also have is like a puppy that likes to sit in your lap while you fly around (it likes to fly too but it’s so small that it gets tired quickly and spends the rest of the journey taking a nap). They both run warm so you don’t get cold even when you’re flying all the way up in the clouds, especially with the little one curled up under your cloak."
Whatcouldgowrong,ffhfgpw,t1_ffhfaws,1579933026.0,I guess I meant that it’s coming off but it seems to be taking a lot of scrubbing and the part of her hand she’s washing doesn’t look any less black. Face paint should be super easy to remove and the fact that it’s not coming off her hands (which are far more resistant to rougher scrubbing) close to immediately is a bad sign.
Whatcouldgowrong,ffhe6et,t1_ffhdw3p,1579931596.0,The girl washing her hands can’t get the paint off. The girl with her whole face covered presumably used the same type of paint and is realizing that she won’t be able to wash it off.

DidntKnowIWantedThat,ffgz33b,t1_ffe0iv0,1579918768.0,"The device could include some sort of “release” mechanism, then use a grabber for pick them up

Or if you have a caregiver they could take off their socks independently and wait for the socks to be removed (that amount of freedom is actually incredibly liberating, being able to dress yourself/remove your own clothes is something a lot of us take for granted)"
funny,ffgygxd,t1_ffdh3z8,1579918309.0,"That sub makes me so sad when I think about the fact that a lot of infomercials are actually selling products for disabled people but hire abled actors because they don’t want to make the product seem like it’s an “accessibility tool” (so it can also be sold to able bodied people). Like, the Snuggie is a super good invention if you’re in a wheelchair, but the infomercial creators knew that wheelchair users would recognize that and buy it even when that use isn’t specified in the ad."
