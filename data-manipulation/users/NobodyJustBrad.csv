MurderedByWords,fffxc3f,t1_fffwxwp,1579893851.0,Densely populated areas also have more options in a given radius than less populated areas. Y'all make this a whole lot more complicated and expensive than it needs to be.
MurderedByWords,fffvulb,t1_fffuuvy,1579892920.0,There you go adding another unnecessary cost. Why is this commute to a minimum wage job long?  Sounds like poor decision making to go for a minimum wage job at a lomg distance.
MurderedByWords,fffucf5,t1_ffftmmp,1579891976.0,"Did I say ""ride share service""? No. I said ride share. Just get a ride from someone. This is a prime example of why I questioned the ""car payment basic need"" in the first place. So many of you attach or assume all these unnecessary costs to things."

MurderedByWords,fffoqmb,t1_fffkwfc,1579888511.0,"A) Good thing there were at least 5 other modes of transportation listed previously.

B) No need to talk about the rest of the costs, or the debate on whether minimum wage is enough or not, as that is not what my original comment was about. It was only about the car payment being considered a ""basic need"", which it is not."

But the main point of my comment in the first place was the laughable notion that so many of you can't fathom getting a car WITHOUT having a car payment. MANY people get cars from their families as they get around driving age. You can also just straight up buy a used car privately for as little as a few hundred dollars. You can easily have a car a no car payment. So my question was, since when is a car PAYMENT a basic need? It is not. Putting in unnecessary costs for your reasoning behind a MINIMUM wage debate only weakens your argument. Minimum wage is meant to just get by on, not to be having a nice new car and stuff. Some of y'all have the most asinine first world problem mentality I've ever seen."

MurderedByWords,ffdtr74,t3_esy8ce,1579828716.0,"Since when is a car payment a basic need?

Edit: So many people asking ""how are you supposed to get there?"" Well, not only is that a stupid question because you can just walk, bike, bus, train, ride share, etc., the point of my comment is that a car PAYMENT is not a ""basic need"". You pea-brains asking that question are assuming having a car = paying for it every month. GET A CHEAPER CAR. The conversation is about MINIMUM WAGE. Trying to justify the minimum wage rate by adding a car payment as a basic need is simply asinine. There are used cars as cheap as a few hundred dollars EVERYWHERE. That, and many people get cars from their families as they get to driving age. You do not NEED a car payment. You NEED to use your brain and realize that having a car is not always synonymous with having a car PAYMENT."

TwoXChromosomes,fersi64,t1_feorxp7,1579357871.0,"No offense or anything, but you didn't really take control of that. It is about the gesture and why that person is giving you the ring. Buying yourself the ring doesn't magically put you into that serious relationship that wants to take a huge step in commitment. It's good that it makes you feel good, sure, but I question the logic behind why it does.

That, and because you're wearing it on your ring finger, you are even less likely now to find the guy for you that would have given you the ring someday due to them thinking you're taken by the mere sight of the ring placement."
