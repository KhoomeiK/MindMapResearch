I was thinking about this earlier and that's exactly what it is. Why can't I roast a gay dude for being flamboyant if I can roast a straight guy for being flamboyant?  Why if someone says anything about someone else who is gay it automatically turns to phobia? 

Now, the implication about Magics son is that he somehow let his father down? And if that were the case, why? We are left to decide, and someone decided it's because he is gay.  I don't think so, I think his dad is very proud of him.

He can say whatever he wants about whoever he wants tho, that's his right. He wasnt being outright hateful. He was just probably trying to make a joke. But let Magics son hear that and fire back... I'd pay for the reaction.

Have you ever heard a really flamboyant guy roast literally anyone around them? They don't give a shit about feelings, they are brutal. Don't get me started on if they see a fat kid or if ""that bitch should really be wearing that? In public?!! Omg""

I'd probably rather be that type of guy than the type that jumps on a downvote bandwagon and attacking someone by falsely assuming something about their character based off a simple statement on food cost for a restaurant.

I am the type to stoop down to someone else's level though, so my answer is: Only when I visit your mother's establishment"

He was polite at first, directing them to other artist and explaining he was out of town. I'm down for that, support your locals for sure. But then to drop the unnecessary rudeness? Tbf, we dont know how long this conversation ran and we dont know the relationship. But to me, had he just said 'I know what I am worth, here is my portfolio. If you dont like it check out the other people in town' he might have still gotten the work at full price. Even cutting a deal could be beneficial if it makes you profit. No sale? No nothin"

It wasn't until I willingly decided to not take them, or pretend I took them but spit them out later that I even showed a personality.

I would love to be able to focus on 1 thing fully, but in my line of work it benefits me to have the ability to notice many details simultaniously that others are simply just not able to."

Cuz when I vent, most of my energy is spent on enemies. 80 percent of what I invent is Hennessy. 20 percent is from being hungry from sin. 10 is become I love being under your skin"""
