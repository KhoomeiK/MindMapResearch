AskWomenOver30,ffj253t,t3_etvbhk,1579988489.0,I wanted 3 when I was growing up. Had 2 and decided that was enough. Pregnancy is hard on the body and I couldn’t do it a third time.
AskWomenOver30,ffj1exp,t1_ffiqwwe,1579987965.0,"I agree. I’ve never had these worries in my relationships. I also don’t worry about policing myself around other couples. I just try to be myself around people and assume that people in relationships are capable of managing their relationships. I’m not a flirtatious person at all so I really don’t have problems with people mistakenly thinking I’m interested in them. And, I’ve only ever had one woman see me as a threat to her relationship and she was crazy jealous and totally nuts so I think she would have thought that no matter what I did just because I’m a woman."
AskWomenOver30,ffiq4xh,t1_ffihryr,1579979935.0,"I haven’t had a nemesis but I have had people I really admired or respected who made me want to improve myself to try to be on their level. I don’t think it’s quite the same thing, though."
MMFB,ffidea9,t3_etobk6,1579971209.0,"You should probably look at changing jobs. The fact is, a lot of work politics is driven by people’s emotional reaction to you and the opinions they’ve formed of you over the years. Some employees are liked, valued, and seen as assets from the start and, unless they really screw up, they tend to keep that status. Some employees are seen as average grunts and, if your employer gives you that label early on, it can be really hard to shake it. It sounds like your employer has decided to put you in the average grunt category. You may never be able to break out of that role. The best way to advance is to find another job and get a fresh start. You need to find an employer who appreciates what you have to offer. 

You also need to slow down. You won’t gain anything by working yourself to death. Obviously, working harder isn’t the way to achieve success here. You need to work smarter and put more efforts into relationship-building. In the end, work quality is only a small part of the picture when it comes to advancing in the workplace. You also have to build solid relationships with your managers and co-workers because being liked and trusted is a huge part of career success. If you aren’t fitting right in your current job, you should find another job where you gel more easily with your co-workers, where people think more like you do. 

You also might need to accept that you may have to pay your dues and work in a grunt role for a longer period of time before anyone will consider promoting you. Like it or not, there are timelines in most industries for career advancements. Certain types of promotions only happen after you’ve put in a certain number of years of experience. Some hotshots can jump the timeline but that isn’t common. I was applying for next level jobs in my industry a year or two ago and getting nowhere. I absolutely had the skills and experience to do the job. But, I could tell I wasn’t getting anywhere because I was too young. Most people who got that type of job were at least five years older than me, often significantly more. I realized that no one will take me seriously as an applicant until I’ve aged some more. You might just have to keep putting in your time in the lower level role for awhile until they feel like you’ve paid your dues for a long enough time to qualify for a promotion."
AskWomenOver30,ffi31xm,t1_ffhiqbo,1579963633.0,"I wonder if it is a nemesis if you don’t engage in return. If you are just shrugging them off and ignoring them, is it a nemesis? Or maybe you are their nemesis but they aren’t yours? 

I have to say, the thought of someone I barely know focusing that much hostile and negative energy on me and wanting to see me fail causes me a lot of anxiety. I don’t know if I could be as calm and confident about it."
AskWomenOver30,ffh7uog,t3_etl2s0,1579925590.0,No. I won’t wear pajamas out in public and I always wear a bra outside the house. That’s about the extent of my fashion requirements for running errands.

Maybe she isn’t the kind of person who feels compelled to post unsent letters on the internet expressing her feelings. Regardless, maybe it would be a good idea to step away from the sub if it is causing you so much distress. Stop looking for her here. The chances of actually finding someone you know are pretty slim since everyone’s letters are so vague in order to preserve anonymity. The only way to survive here is to assume your person isn’t here, get stuff off your chest for the therapeutic value, and read what other people post just to find people who express what you are also feeling and to know that other people out there can understand what you are going through."

UnsentLetters,ffec50g,t1_ffe3f1s,1579842744.0,"> The rest is just knowing I'm not healthy enough for anyone right now.

Is anyone ever healthy enough? We all have our insecurities and neuroses. We all have things that are off. We all have personality flaws. Many of us have lifelong physical and mental health issues. If you wait to get close to someone until you are perfectly healthy, you will be dead. You don’t have to be perfect or even perfectly healthy to be loved. People will love you even with your challenges and they will want to support you through them. You just have to find someone compassionate and trust them to love you even with your challenges. Trust them to know and decide for themselves what they are willing to take on. I imagine you would want to be there and support the people you love through their health challenges. Trust people to do the same for you."

UnsentLetters,ffcuz0k,t3_esudyw,1579807797.0,"It sounds like you haven’t taken responsibility for your role in your affair. Blaming your affair partner will get you nowhere. You are not a child. You make your own choices. You control who you associate with and the types and depth of relationships you form with those people. You are responsible for setting and maintaining boundaries. You need to own those choices if you ever want to fix things with your wife. You need to demonstrate true remorse for your own actions, not just remorse that you are experiencing consequences because of what happened."
offmychest,ffcdf0w,t3_esswv6,1579797054.0,"I don’t know. Maybe it’s the proliferation of “barely legal” porn. Maybe it’s normalized the fantasy for a lot of guys. Maybe they don’t know a lot of actual 16 year old girls so they don’t have a good sense for how much maturing they have left to do. Television often uses adults to play teenagers so maybe they are picturing an older and more mature person when they picture a 16 year old. I would hope that if they actually spend time around real live teenage girls, they would find the whole idea gross and off-putting."
AskWomenOver30,ffcb1is,t1_ffc35uf,1579795570.0,"Yeah, I make an effort but I will never be beautiful. I’ve spent my whole life trying to figure out how to do my hair, have worked with stylists, tried different things. I’m resigned to the fact that, the best I’ll ever be able to achieve is “neat and tidy.” Usually, I call it my “helmet hair.”   I have to wear glasses because I have serious dry eyes and can’t tolerate contacts. I also have problems with dizziness when wearing them. I get stylish frames but it is still glasses. I can’t get LASIK because my prescription hasn’t stabilized yet. It just keeps getting worse. And the bone structure of my face is almost identical to my brother’s. Looks good on a man. Not so much on a woman. I’m also prone to random allergic reactions to lots of things so I have to be really careful about what products I use on my skin.  I dress well for my frame and I exercise and take a Barre class for strength and toning. But, it won’t change the fact that I’m pretty average/non-descript, the kind of woman no one ever sees. I try to make up for it by being an interesting person."
AskMenOver30,ffc4qol,t1_ffbzxt6,1579791488.0,"We get sub zero temps. Most of January is in single digits and teens, sometimes just below zero. It is cold, but manageable if you wear layers and bundle up. We get a polar vortex a couple of times a winter when it gets down to -30 F. It rarely snows during those temps because extreme cold in the winter is usually associated with a high pressure system and high pressure systems bring clear, dry weather. Sometimes the snow happens right before the temperature drops. When that is predicted, I get out and shovel while the snow is still falling before the temperature drop happens. There might be an inch or two left, not enough to impede driving. I just wait until the polar vortex ends and then shovel the last bit. It really isn’t that bad. I think winter, especially right after or during a fresh snow fall, is really pretty. 

If you really hate shoveling that much, perhaps you should save up for a snow-blower. My neighbors who have them finish their driveways in a quarter of the time it takes me to shovel. I’ve also found that, if I shovel the street in front of my house and in the area immediately next to my house before the plows come through, then I don’t get the wall of snow from the plows at the foot of my driveway. There’s still a little bit of extra snow but it isn’t terrible."

I actually love going for hour+ walks when it is in the thirties and forties, even with a wind.  Shoveling in those temps is no big deal. I usually get too warm.

It can be hard to find inexpensive casual t-shirts that don’t have pictures or words on them and don’t look like something a grandmother would wear.
offmychest,ff6nr35,t1_ff69q65,1579631117.0,"I was fired. Had a boss (my supervisor’s boss) who really didn’t like having women explain things to him, question him, or seem smarter than him (I learned this from co-workers after the fact). He was fine when guys disagreed, pushed back, or educated him. When women did it, he would punish or discipline them. It was a union environment so there were limits with how far he could go on that. Unfortunately, I was still in a ridiculously long probation period when I had my first real encounter with him. He didn’t like that I had an opinion about the project I was working on or that I explained and backed up the approach I wanted to take. He said I was “condescending” because I didn’t immediately agree with him and he fired me to make a point to the other employees who might dare to disagree with him. So much for speaking up."
AskWomenOver30,ff6a8ms,t3_erp6eu,1579622755.0,"I feel exactly the same way. I have had anxiety since I was a kid and it made me very timid when I was young. I was a rule follower because I was afraid of consequences. I was responsible because I was afraid of letting people down. I was closed off and never let loose or lost control because I was afraid of being judged. So, I never had any real fun. It makes me sad. I can’t do it now. I have a family and responsibilities. I feel like I missed out. I’m actually embarrassed by my lack of experiences. When people talk about the partying lifestyle like it’s something everyone knows about, I smile and laugh and pretend I totally understand because I don’t want them to know how much of a square I was."

AskWomenOver30,ff568m9,t3_eroiv1,1579581403.0,"I won’t add current co-workers, even if they are good friends. It just feels risky, like you are potentially giving your employer access to your social media. I don’t post anything I’m ashamed of but I still don’t want my employer to know that much detail about my non-work life. Other than that, if I receive a request and I know the person, I usually accept it. On Facebook, if I don’t feel like I know someone well, I will mark them as an acquaintance.

It’s possible it has happened and they just haven’t said anything but it certainly isn’t normalized behavior.

That being said, it sounds like you might have some depression resulting from the experiences you’ve been through. That inability to feel happiness is a hallmark of depression. The whole world feels gray. The standard treatment for depression is therapy and, sometimes, medication. You can get medication from your regular doctor without doing therapy but it tends to be more of a band-aid fix. The therapy is what helps you learn the tools to manage the depression and to think through the trauma that brought it on. Is there some way to pursue reduced cost therapy? There may be some online counseling sites. Maybe some of the schools that teach/train psychologists offer therapy with students who are still learning? If you can’t meet with a therapist one-on-one, there might be group therapy available. There are probably support groups for cancer survivors.

My oldest friends are from law school. I lost touch with high school and college friends years ago. Since then, I’ve made friends through work and shared hobbies. I’ve also made friends with my friends’ friends."
AskWomenOver30,femvulh,t1_femm6u9,1579270961.0,"I’m the same. I moved away after college and mostly lost touch with my high school and college friends. So, my friends are nearly all people I met after college.  Some I’ve known for more than a decade. Some are newer. I love them all. 

That said, I’ve definitely noticed more selfishness in people in general in the last few years. Not sure if that is my age or something changing in society."

AskMen,femtg2e,t1_fembjd8,1579269116.0,"I don’t think women should make all of the decisions about who their SO can be friends with or who they should be friends with as a couple. It’s awfully controlling.

I’m not sure what point you are trying to make in response to my comment about general gatekeeping behavior. Are you saying that, from an evolutionary standpoint, only women can choose good friends? Because I think that premise is highly suspect."

AskMen,felswbt,t1_felqzxs,1579230119.0,Some women have this weird need to gatekeep who you can be friends with as a couple. They have to be the one to choose the friends. I’ve never understood it but it is surprisingly common.

Until then, best to try to see him as just a friend."

If I take an hour lunch, that means adding an hour at the end of the day to get a full 8 hours. I don’t enjoy socializing with co-workers and there isn’t much near my office to do. I’d rather have the time at the end of the day than waste an hour during the middle. So, I work through lunch."

UnsentLetters,fei81l0,t3_ep3hd7,1579132351.0,"Depression really messes up your thought processes about your relationships. When I am depressed, I worry a lot about being a burden to the people I care about. I am embarrassed by the fact that I am depressed and how that depression has diminished my ability to do and be the person I used to be. So, I hide away and isolate myself.  When I interact with people, I try to act like everything’s okay, like I’m the same person I’ve always been. I don’t want people to see me in my diminished state and be disappointed in me. I don’t want to add to their worries and problems since they are all so busy in their lives and have so much to deal with.  I feel like no one sees me. I feel isolated because I can hide myself away and hear from no one for long periods of time because I’m really not that important to anyone’s daily life.  At some point, I start to tell myself that people wouldn’t really notice or care if I’m gone.  They might have a few moments of sadness but I’m not that important to them so it won’t be a lasting effect.  I weigh that against the intense pain and unhappiness I am experiencing, the complete absence of joy and purpose, and the endless grayness of life and it gets harder and harder to keep choosing to continue to exist in the dreariness to keep others from feeling what to me seems like it would be minimal sadness. 

In actuality, there are people who care and who would be really sad if I died. They would want me to ask for help and would willingly provide it without judgment. But, depression takes away my ability to see that. It’s the nature of the disease. It takes professional help to fight it. I’m so sorry that your friend succumbed to it, especially at such a young age. You are a good friend. I wish he could have seen and understood how much you care. I wish depression hadn’t blinded him to it. It is a truly awful disease."

I dread going to work. I hate it so much. I’ve been job hunting because I really don’t want a hole in my resume. Plus, I can’t afford to not work. But, it is killing me and I am so angry and resentful, I’m not a very friendly employee. I have to get out of here. I don’t have much advice except keep looking for something else.

I have high expectations for myself and I can be really hard on myself when I don’t meet those expectations. It’s one of the things I am in therapy for. A couple of years ago, I made some significant anxiety-driven mistakes and I was so hard on myself, I drove myself into depression. But, I’ve been working on it. Progress has been slow but I am making progress.

But, I am definitely less judgmental of other people’s mistakes. I have always been inclined to give people the benefit of the doubt but the more mistakes I make, the more forgiving I become. So, I have become less judgmental of others with age. Just not of me."

AskMen,fe3fzmu,t1_fe32rnt,1578848935.0,"It would be kind of paternalistic for you to ghost him or cut contact because you think it is what’s best for him. You would be taking away his ability to make decisions about his life and it feels awful to lose that decision-making power. If you enjoy the friendship, I would just continue to be clear that it is just a friendship and leave it to him to figure out what he needs to do to manage his feelings. Maybe he will eventually decide he needs to end the friendship. Maybe he will find some other way to come to terms with it. If you aren’t unhappy or uncomfortable with the relationship as is, then it should be his decision."

As a friend, I would be pretty devastated if my best friend cut me out of their life. Good friends are hard to come by."
