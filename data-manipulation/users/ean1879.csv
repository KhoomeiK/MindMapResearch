The only thing I can tell you is that it will get better.  Until then, you may question yourself, perhaps put some blame on yourself, out even randomly find yourself crying.  But it will get better.  Dobby looks very special, and you should feel very special that you got to spend that time with him! üíôüíô"

tacobell,fep1c82,t3_eq43ux,1579309936.0,OMG...a Taco Bell truck that delivers like an Ice Cream Truck.  That's so good it's naughty.  And a million dollar idea.  But the million dollar question...what song would it play?

digitalnomad,fe51t84,t1_fe4znkx,1578864922.0,"The most difficult part of the journey was getting to Prague where we had to take a 3 1/2 hour bus ride from Nuremberg. Everything else was train.

digitalnomad,fe4xmgm,t3_enqdiq,1578863792.0,"My wife and I visited Christmas markets this year in Switzerland, Strasbourg (France), Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Nuremberg, and Prague. By FAR, our favorite Christmas market was Strasbourg, and there are several cute little towns nearby that are famous for their wine - even the city that Beauty and the Beast is based on.  The Christmas markets in those small little towns were so romantic on their own. Nuremberg was super busy, and our least favorite. Rothenburg ob der Tauber, was very cute and nice, but also very small. Prague's market was gorgeous in the (Old Town Square), but it just was not very big (although bigger than RodT."
