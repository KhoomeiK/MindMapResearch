There are also people who saw the recent Star Wars movies who haven't seen the original trilogy.  And they can do that too.. I'm just saying that it does seem strange that as time passes a fan base can become so removed from the original inspiration that started everything that followed. I would maintain though, that if you are a real fan of TNG it is rewarding to watch the original series, which I admit might be hard for younger viewers to do with the dated effects etc."
TNG,fficfhv,t1_ffib1do,1579970550.0,"This discussion amuses me a little, because I grew up with the original series in syndication and remember when TNG first came out. Back then it didn't make sense to watch TNG without having any experience with the original series ( which was still ""the real Star Trek"" before TNG managed to establish itself and come into its own ). Now of course for many people TNG is their first Star Trek series and have never seen TOS, and apparently have no problem with the callbacks to TOS from TNG that go over their heads"

startrek,ffg21yk,t1_fffjgvm,1579896767.0,"One thing I do like about this series so far is that they are not trying to pretend that Picard is not as old as he is - witness how hard it is for him to run up the steps for example - but at the same time they show that he is quite capable and experienced and has much to offer. There is so often a subtle ageism in Hollywood where older people are reduced to doddering stereotypes or we have to pretend that age has not changed their capabilities in any way .
