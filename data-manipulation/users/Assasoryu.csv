Hong_Kong,ffvassk,t1_ffu0lb2,1580259740.0,You should be glad that all these returning students are wearing masks. They didn't have to bother it's not the custom here in the uk. the masks do a better job keeping the coughs and sneezes in than stopping outside viruses infecting the wearer. Sure the old hags will be alarmed by anything new but it's for their own good. I tried to buy some n95s today and it's just not going to happen on the high street here. Had to order on Amazon it's gonna take ages

todayilearned,ffqt1o8,t1_ffqn2v1,1580142985.0,We still do. The reason they always get a freshly slaughtered chicken for red calendar days isn't just for a nice meal. My grandma don't even know it but she's basically sacrificing a chicken for good luck. Also the whole roast pig for big gathering dinners is the same thing. But people just want the big meal and don't care much about the slaughter now
gifs,ffoz20s,t3_eud39b,1580083535.0,It's not so long ago when I saw him do an interview about how he hasn't played any basketball since the day he retired and he simply had to stop so he can learn how to live without being a pro athlete(he was a crazy workaholic). He explained how hes living  a different live being a writer producer father and he's enjoying it so much. I thought well done Kobe so many lose their way after pro sports but you have found more passions in life and don't miss it at all. And that you have a new baby(old interview) it's so sad. To think one of your daughter was with you and perished too. So sad...

videos,ffg3jxa,t1_fffxlyj,1579897692.0,Just so you know. This oil cleaning gig started in Japan. It was quickly banned and the Taiwanese picked up the method and ran with it. Importing the raw materials from Japan then processing it in Taiwan. As the Taiwanese often does they looked across the sea and saw a bigger more profitable market with even more raw materials. This was back in the 80s. When the 1st scandals broke. The biggest producer was Taiwanese.  This doesn't absolve the people currently doing it now but as it's been shown time and time again. The worst shit that goes down in China usually has a Taiwanese business man behind it

Those hex bubbles do nothing on the sides and when they did the zigzag sole thing. Runners found out those was complete crap too. The pump was a pointless gimmick, the rubber bladder made the shoe heavier than they would otherwise be and the tougue unbreathable and sweaty. The only decent thing they've ever made was the fury boost but that's a lifestyle shoe at best"
