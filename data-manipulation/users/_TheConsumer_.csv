The country was founded on the principle that the private sector (and the individual states) would meet most (if not all) of society's needs.

The pursuit part means we are free to follow our own star - and make of our life what we want. This can mean application to the arts, sciences, business, etc. We aren't hemmed in - and we believe in social mobility. 

There is a reason why ""government regulation"" is taboo in our country - it bucks our founding principles. The idea of government entitlement programs also does this - and is met with equal disdain. You're free to pursue happiness - and if you don't find happiness, that is on you. It isn't the government's job to fund your path. 

With individual liberty comes individual responsibility. You have to figure out a way to success. In addition, you are responsible to wield great power in a prudent way. Our founders gave us the right to bear arms to be used responsibly. If the *individual* uses that power recklessly, then the *individual* should be punished.

> Wtf? Is anyone here except you talking about constitutional obligations to fund anything? Where are you getting that?

I have been saying it all along. You're insisting that the federal government should be paying for our transit system. I have been saying it should not. It is under no obligation to do so. Our problems are our own. The best way to sort them out is to get our own budget under control - and to charge real world fares. 

> Why is it a waste of time?

Because it is creating a reliance on federal funding (which is always subject to change/fluctuate), rather than getting our own house in order. Setting a budget shouldn't be ""We're going to deficit spend forever, and hope that the federal government can cover the rest."" 

This brings us full circle: I have stated numerous times that the MTA should be privatized. This is where the conversation started. A private organization would charge a real world price, and would improve service. More importantly, it would reduce graft. There wouldn't be tens of thousands of hours of fraudulent overtime, there wouldn't be no-show jobs, and there would be actual accountability. The only reason we don't have a private MTA is because the MTA was turned into a political weapon in the 1960s. The Governor assumed control of the agency - and promised people in NYC that he - and he alone - would keep the fares low. 

Something as vital as the city's mass transit should not be a political weapon. Put it into the private realm with heavy oversight and regulation."

There cannot be any reasonable amount of physical evidence of sex abuse after 20+ years. So, you will be trying people for sex abuse on circumstantial evidence and foggy memories.

More importantly, your SO insists it happened based on recollection and nothing more . You recollect differently - but who cares? You must have done it, right?

> Why is it a waste of time?

Because it is creating a reliance on federal funding (which is always subject to change/fluctuate), rather than getting our own house in order. Setting a budget shouldn't be ""We're going to deficit spend forever, and hope that the federal government can cover the rest."" 

This brings us full circle: I have stated numerous times that the MTA should be privatized. This is where the conversation started. A private organization would charge a real world price, and would improve service. More importantly, it would reduce graft. There wouldn't be tens of thousands of hours of fraudulent overtime, there wouldn't be no-show jobs, and there would be actual accountability. The only reason we don't have a private MTA is because the MTA was turned into a political weapon in the 1960s. The Governor assumed control of the agency - and promised people in NYC that he - and he alone - would keep the fares low. 

Something as vital as the city's mass transit should not be a political weapon. Put it into the private realm with heavy oversight and regulation."
