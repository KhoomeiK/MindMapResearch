StPetersburgFL,fdwrlhf,t3_en234c,1578761676.0,If you don't mind primitive (no services or bathrooms) swfwmd allows camping on a lot of the properties they own for free. You just have to sign up online and print out your permit. The Southwest Florida Management district has a lot of property in the area.

funny,fds9jre,t1_fdrt1jw,1578697479.0,"When I took the train from Stuttgart to Paris several years ago, nobody checked your ticket until you were already on the train and underway, but IIRC when I asked what would have happened should I not have my ticket I was told I could be arrested and heavily fined. 

In Stuttgart for public transit like the local train, when you boarded you self-punched your ticket and occasionally someone would stand up, announce they were with the transit authority and ask to see everyone's tickets. A ticket for the whole day was like 8 Euro, but I was told the fine for not having a ticket was around 90 Euro."

It'd be worth $720,567.86 in today's money after being awarded in 1969."

StPetersburgFL,fdrnbel,t3_emkqb5,1578686886.0,"Check out clubsavor.com. It's $30/month but you get BOGO entree and first drink so you'll quickly earn your money back and save more if you go out to eat more than once. Lots of restaurants to choose from but Captain Bill's on Treasure Island honors it and they have good food though they're closed for lunch right now. 

Definitely bring the car seat on the plane for the toddler. It's recommended and free. My wife and I were lucky enough to find morning or later evening flights and our toddler (both at 1 and 18 months) thankfully fell asleep for the 4 flights we took to see in-laws. Make sure you have something for them to drink or snack on as swallowing will help them adjust to pressure changes on the plane. If you have netflix, I recommend downloading a few episodes of Word Party or whatever your child likes to keep them occupied if they don't sleep. 

If you don't bring a pack and play then I recommend just dragging a mattress onto the floor for sleeping so they don't have far to fall if they roll out. 

Definitely going to need lots of sunscreen and preferably a large umbrella or canopy for the beach. The sun here will give you sunburn pretty quickly especially if you have fairer skin, even on a cloudy day you can get burned.

tampa,fdrccx0,t3_emsol6,1578682498.0,"I use Bank OZK over in St Pete for business and personal and they've been great. They have location(s) in Tampa as well. Free checking (unless you do too many transfers etc in a month). Banking app seems to work well and they are soon rolling out a way to pay instantly through zell or some kind of app integration. Not a credit union but I haven't paid any fees for doing basic banking, and the people are nice and helpful. 

The only other credit union I have experience with is USF and I think they're only open to students."

It was first issued 20 years ago when I registered and they send me a new one any time my polling place changes or there are other changes that require me to need a new card.

There's virtually no voter fraud happening as evidenced by Trump's ""Voter Fraud Panel"" being disbanded after finding no real ""there"" there. What fraud there has been is few and far between and outside of the nonsense that happened with mail in ballots being filled out by that Republican in North Carolina (?) none of the voter fraud found has had any actual effect on election integrity."
