Why not just title it as a piece of art instead of trying to justify to other people why you are using porn for models? If this was really a texture study, you could have used a million different subjects, but this artist chose fishnets and leather on a curvy model. 

I'm not bashing or talking smack. It's just an observation I notice a lot and I want to see people own their work. Even if you straight up ""study"" a naked girl on her knees with her mouth open to the viewer, own it. 

You're not fooling anyone with this study bs. The only thing you're studying is the pornographic aspect of the model. And that's ok! Many many artists use their libido as energy and motivation for creating. It's a legit technique. It's just way better when you claim it as an art piece instead of practice. Because when its practice it feels like the art was part of a masturbation session and you thought it turned out good looking enough to share.
