I didn't want to go on that ride because i get hysteric when i have to stand on a ladder and i won't even begin to tell you what i went through at the Grand Canyon when DH stood at the brink and looked down.

But he insisted and so we went on that ride - i didn't want to let him die alone and as i sat down, i really thought i was going to shit myself. Then it started, and then it was over. Don't get me wrong, it was exciting, but also like... ""Ok, um... well. Wanna go grab a burger?""

Frankly...  ""Goliath"" in SixFlags over Georgia was way more thrilling.

funny,fcafjie,t3_egt53v,1577568364.0,"Those are the best days. 

No work, no liabilities, no parties you're forced to attend. No need to go outside besides a short trip to the grocery store. Just staying up all night, sleeping in, eating unhealthy food because it doesn't matter anymore, lots of Netflix and YouTube, video games or reading... all in all just doing what you want, not what you have to do. 

Life is good at the moment.
