facepalm,ff2u9d5,t1_ff2tukm,1579524397.0,"Well, so Jaguars and leopards can both have melanistic morphs that I’ve heard called panthers. Bagheera in the Jungle Book was a melanistic leopard, but is called a panther. 

The main differences between the two, other than geographic distribution, is size. Jaguars are a lot bigger than leopards, and they have large heads in proportion to the rest of their body. I also notice jaguars seem to have an almost shinier fur as well. 

Jaguars are native to the Americas, while leopards can be found throughout Africa and Asia (I believe there are still populations in Iran, India, the Arabian peninsula, China, and far eastern Russia)."

facepalm,ff2n36m,t1_ff2di0x,1579514226.0,"“Panther,” as such, isn’t a biologically specific term, really. It is most commonly used to refer to melanistic leopards or jaguars. Also used to refer to the extant cougar population found in Florida. It is used mostly colloquially, but I’ve personally never heard it used to really refer to lions. 

“Panthera” apparently ultimately derives from the Greek word for leopard, and only came to describe the whole genus in the 19th century when the Latinized word was adopted for taxonomic purposes. 

A fun fact I just picked up, apparently early taxonomists classified the melanistic leopards as a separate species (black panther), and so that’s kinda where the separate usage might come from. Apparently Latin also had a separate word for leopard (pardus), so the leopard’s formal binomial name, Panthera pardus, is just a fancy way of saying leopard leopard."
