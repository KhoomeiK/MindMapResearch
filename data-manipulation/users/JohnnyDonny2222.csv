This sophistry is unnecessary. Trump claimed he was quoting the newspaper, to deflect any criticism of inaccuracy. You knew what I was trying to say, or at the very least, you could click on the article I kindly provided explaining exactly what happens. You've created a false dichotomy in an attempt to make my argument seem more complicated than it is.

>What’s your theory? That people are idiots? It’s not very interesting to say that since I’d guess that 99% of humans are idiots about one thing or another (including me)

I'd like to redirect you back to the focus of this conversation. Is Trump credible? Clearly he says things that aren't true. And a lie is a lie, even if some people see through it. You are trying to make a simple issue complicated to disguise it. It doesn't matter if dog whistle tactics are how he communicates, a statement that is factually incorrect, the speaker refuses to acknowledge is wrong, most people take literally, and the speaker intends them to take it that way, is a lie. Not a joke."
LessCredibleDefence,ffayxvz,t1_ffaxnh3,1579747725.0,"1. I was talking in context of you referring to the theory that Trump claimed that Cruz Sr. killed Kennedy as hyperbole. If this was hyperbole, then Cruz was indeed involved in the murder, just not the triggerman. This was a claim you accepted in this thread, regardless of whether Trump himself did.
And your claim that this is a joke is wrong. Trump doesn't lie about what was a joke, he will say so afterwards, like the China Global Warming Hoax thing. Trump doubled down on this, claiming he was quoting the Newspaper. This doesn't fit the pattern of Trump joking.

>2) Trump always repeats conspiracy theories and talks off the cuff during speeches. It’s a strategy to make him relatable to people who also read those. Not sure if you every chatted with a “conspiracy theorist” in real life but most of them are just throwing around ideas or talking shit knowingly.

>3) See above - once again this is the kind of thing people say in casual conversation. Trump won his supporters specifically because he talks a lot of shit and says ridiculous things that they know are ridiculous.
>Not saying he tells the truth, but just that his lies are not meant to be believable.

I'm not going to get to much into the definition of a joke, but I'd urge you to read the actual quotes where Trump raised these issues. They don't strike me as tongue and cheek, or even deadpan. If you find these jokes funny, well, I hope you aren't a stand-up comedian.

>If Soleimani is a valid target in this proxy war, then we surely can't complain if the Iranians target the CIA chief, Jared Kushner, or the CENTCOM commander. They're equally valid targets, planning attacks on Iran.

I actually agree with you. However I would urge the Iranians caution, as they are not military peers with the United States, and if the United States choses to be be hypocritical, they have a vastly superior capacity to escalate simply because they are a superpower. If you are looking for some reading into how states function, I would highly recommend [Thucydides' Melian dialogue](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/melian.htm). It is not long, but it starkly lays out how states behave in the international theater, contrasting the realism of the Athenians and the Idealism of the Melians. He outlines how statesmen think and behave the world over, and it still holds very true to this day in my opinion. One caveat: read him from a descriptive rather than prescriptive tone. Thucydides is describing the world as he sees it and believes it will always be, rather than as he believes it should be. 

Here is a writeup and analysis of the dialogue, if you don't feel like wading through archaic prose:

https://protesilaos.com/seminars/melian-dialogue-realism/

The main thing I want you to take from this is the role that ideals such as morality, justice, and international law play in politics. That they only work from a position of equality, and tit for tat retaliation such as assassinating a general in response for an embassy siege come the closest to achieving this equality as is possible in such an unbalanced power dynamic.

>It's hard to complain when the President is doubling down on targeting cultural sites.

I agree with you in the fact that President Trump is not handling this scenario very well. He does not seem to be a competent enough statesman to pull this one off, and I am skeptical of his motives.

LessCredibleDefence,fdf16vw,t1_fdc0ago,1578350986.0,"I don't think you really understand diplomatic immunity, but I would be happy to help clear things up with you. Soleimani was indeed in Iraq to meet with militia members and Iraqi politicians. Even if the US claims about imminent attacks are true, this would be a diplomatic mission. However, just because it would be a diplomatic mission does not mean that diplomatic immunity applies. Soleimani was a Major General in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. He is in the military. Military members usually don't have diplomatic immunity, especially when they are involved in operations such as planning attacks. Can you imagine if every person who killed an enemy soldier in war was rung up on charges for murdering a foreign diplomat? 

And sure, no *official* state of war existed between the US and Iran, however a proxy war undeniably does. The gap between a proxy war and a real war depends solely on whether a country involved decides to call bullshit. And Donald Trump, for better or worse, finally decided to, whether for the reasons I listed or perhaps more likely petty political ones, I can't say. However, given that this state of war exists, overtly or otherwise, assassinating him isn't out of the ordinary. Or should the US apologize to Japan for assassinating Yamamoto? He was an enemy flag officer being assassinated almost solely for orchestrating the deaths of many American service members (It was called Operation Vengeance for crying out loud), something Soleimani can be accused of. Sure, the war was less overt, but that doesn't mean it didn't exist.

The attack on the embassy was a violation of diplomatic immunity, and you don't deny that. Even if Soleimani were a diplomat, his targeting would be a response to the violation of diplomatic immunity by an escalated violation in return to remind the Iranians why diplomatic immunity is an important thing. If Iranians don't respect international law, then they can't expect other people to respect it to them, as international law is in reality purely contractual, despite what the laws themselves say. This has been a reality for as long as international relations have been a thing. For instance, in WWI, Germany illegally threatened to execute American POW's who were found carrying shotguns. America responded by threatening to execute German POW's in retaliation. Ultimately, the Germans decided to not gamble that America was bluffing, and no laws of war were broken in this instant. International law is only powerful if there is a credible threat of retaliation for violations, otherwise a country will break the laws when convenient. This is because there is no police or overarching authority to hold countries to laws: the international system is mostly anarchic, governed only by the balances of power. If the Iranians violated American immunity, then they will face retaliation according to historical norms. Contrary to what you suggested, the American retaliation is no breach in tradition, as it is a direct response to the embassy siege (and probably not a clear and present danger due further attacks)"
