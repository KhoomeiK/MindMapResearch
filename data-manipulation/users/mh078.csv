AskAnAmerican,ffcf556,t1_ffcf22n,1579798125.0,Episode one was pretty good. I’d give it a shot.
AskAnAmerican,ffceup1,t1_ffcbj88,1579797948.0,The guy who plays House plays a British guy on Avenue 5.
AskAnAmerican,ffceqq3,t1_ffcdpz0,1579797882.0,Mr. Brightside has been huge for a few years now. I’d say right up there with Don’t Stop Believing and above Tiny Dancer for sing along anthems.
college,ff6hhfw,t3_erxcei,1579627302.0,"If you are taking 12 credits you are taking 12 credits. I have taken one credit classes that are once a week for the semester and ones that are twice a week for half a semester. Both are counted the same, a credit is a credit."
maryland,ff6eple,t1_ff6edcd,1579625579.0,"Yeah I would say it’s hard to fail out of a BCPS high school and not graduate. You really only need to try on a few assignments a quarter. You can even flat out fail one quarter a year and still pass the class. 

Even if you fail a class the Saturday school classes are even easier if you just show up to them. The value of a high school diploma is literally worthless."
maryland,ff6eavg,t1_ff5lxyr,1579625326.0,Idk why you are getting downvoted this is exactly how it was in BCPS schools.
maryland,ff3i9x7,t1_ff3hxon,1579541621.0,"Yeah the mix is interesting as well. I think my favorite soup I’ve ever had was a corn, crab, and red pepper bisque. It was a little spicy and absolutely delicious."

college,fem987n,t1_fem8xrb,1579244447.0,"It’s also important not to diagnose people without all that facts and it must be done through a professional so you can’t be sure, but if he was normal before this could be schizophrenic behavior."
college,fem8q2x,t1_feltdlt,1579243871.0,Yeah I totally agree especially if you are in a small major it’s easy for a large school to feel small. Also much more of a chance an employer will be an alumni and that can be a great in. Finally if you decide you don’t like your major you don’t usually risk the possibility of having to transfer to a different school.
college,fem8erc,t3_eps7yi,1579243515.0,Schizophrenia usually begins to appear around the early 20s so that would be my guess. If he experienced a trauma that could have triggered it.
college,fek8jf1,t3_eplybl,1579194838.0,I love walking by the crazies because people always mess with them. Just learn a few verses that are completely outdated and use those back at them if they say you are going to hell. Say you’ll see them there or something like that. Or just put headphones in and ignore them it’s not that hard.
AskReddit,fej8cl5,t3_epduqa,1579161255.0,I’m late to the response but I’ll have to go with wet shaving. I have been doing it for almost a year now and have yet to majorly slice my face open. Definitely worth a try.
AskReddit,fej86xo,t1_feiu6db,1579161049.0,My go to knot would have to be the trinity. I like the Eldridge but sometimes it’s just too much.
videos,feh6jz1,t1_feh5svy,1579110194.0,"That may happen with lottery winners and football players but I don’t think it will happen with Brad, Ken, or even James (he even is a professional gambler). Brad has been winning large sums of money since 2000 and if he was able to not blow it all while he was still in his early 20s, I think he’ll be fine in his later years as well. He’s very smart, clearly, and seems to know how to use his money well."
videos,feh5huy,t1_fegzqhz,1579109557.0,5 million dollars is like making 100k a year for 50 years. Not to mention interest. He’s not going to go hungry.
videos,feg1med,t1_fefz3ab,1579073039.0,He’s made close to 5 million on game shows. The payout for the tournament he just did with ken and James was 250k for coming in second and third. I think he’s ok.
college,fecxy06,t1_fecsu3d,1578989158.0,Look up his Instagram it will all become clear.
college,fecxw91,t1_fecwupd,1578989096.0,Also I’d check out his socials they are quite entertaining. Actual clown.
college,fecxumi,t1_fecwupd,1578989039.0,The book is written by the prof and from his company. There’s a reason he is making them buy his book and that’s because no one else would want to. The resale value would be nonexistent and there probably wouldn’t be rental options available. If there are rental options then the signing of the cover would eliminate that option. This prof is just a massive dick and shouldn’t be teaching at all.
college,fecxox6,t1_fecprr7,1578988841.0,The book is written by the prof it’s literally just a cash grab. I’m pretty sure it is a get rich quick type of book judging from the profs Instagram.
AskReddit,fecmoox,t1_fecmid7,1578977726.0,Huh interesting I was just thinking of the sperm cloud type which would be interesting.

college,fe9xk5a,t3_eo7ka2,1578942302.0,"Learn how to eat right and manage your time. You will have a much more open schedule but you still have to budget time to eat and cook if you don’t have a meal plan. Beer and lots of other alcoholic drinks have tons for sugars and calories so make sure you don’t drink too much or you’ll put on a few. 

Stay hydrated. 

Basically just practice healthy habits and it’ll help you out a lot.

Learn how to study effectively."
college,fe5smcz,t3_envur1,1578874048.0,UMD is good for engineering and ok for music. UD is good for chemE. Large state schools would essentially be what they should look at.
AskAnAmerican,fe0af69,t1_fe092jc,1578807701.0,The problem is getting it.
maryland,fdzav7o,t3_enedc6,1578788320.0,The old loch raven area has some abandoned houses from when they put in the dam.
AskAnAmerican,fdz02o4,t3_enbh90,1578785368.0,Legal food but seriously taboo would have to be human meat. No laws against cannibalism here.
