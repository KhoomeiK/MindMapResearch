I feel sorry for you and your ilk.  You're like a guy with constipation that really needs to take a comfortable shit: All you really need to do is fucking relax, put your elbows on your knees, and let it go. Yet you can't, because in reality you are just happy in your misery.

It is truly a sad thing when somebody uses the death of a 13-year-old girl and her father to further acrimony against another person. It speaks *volumes* to your character."

Christianity,ffpjf16,t1_ffpgc09,1580096475.0,">Abortion has become a hairy issue for Pelosi, who has defended congressional funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider, and vowed to defend the landmark abortion legalization case Roe v. Wade with ""every tool in our disposal.""

>The California congresswoman has described herself as a ""devout practicing Catholic,"" identifying with what is perhaps the largest pro-life organization in the world.

>Catholic clergy have repeatedly condemned both the act itself and pro-choice political advocacy. Vatican officials have reportedly said Pelosi should be denied the sacrament of Holy Communion and the last pope -- Pope Benedict XVI -- personally reminded her of the Church's stance on the issue during a private meeting.

>Pelosi has defended her position by suggesting that she knew more than the pope did on the issue.

Christianity,ffpfxtk,t1_ffp1sml,1580094074.0,"That's fair.

On the other hand, how can a believer rightly make a decision between one [corrupt] politician and another? Do we go purely upon what they say, or upon their actions?  I think that we (or some of us) can agree that there is really no ""win"" in terms of pure faith.  They are all fallen. Heck, Nancy Pelosi is supposed to be a Catholic, but she believes in the right of a woman to murder her unborn nearly up to birth.  For that she should be refused the Sacrament.  I don't know that any Catholics in SF have said anything about this, or if the church itself have forbade her from taking the Sacrament.

That's just an example.  Truth be told, you have a choice: Vote or do not vote.  Mennonites typically don't vote, and neither do Quakers or the Amish. So take a position. Take a stand one way or another. I, for one, intend on voting for that person whom I believe will ultimately advance, and give way to, life for the unborn, and the freedom to preach the gospel in America."

Christianity,ffp0q52,t1_ffoymu4,1580084076.0,"But it's not really ""the most simple answer.""  Trump is practically a life-long liberal (though probably more left-center). It is conceivable that he actually has refined his views on abortion.  I'm just saying that I have no place to judge a man on his views; nor am I in any position to judge whether any person is being disingenuous. I don't know the hearts of people. God does. As a fellow human I just have to decide on behavior.

Perhaps unlike others on this forum, I take the view that I have no Godly right to judge others, because my own thoughts, acts, and sometimes behaviors, reflects my own tendency to sin. I'm in the very same position as any other sinner.  It is not up to me to render a judgement as to another person's personal sin.

God is righteous. Always."
