AskReddit,fe4isa6,t3_ensmfk,1578859781.0,"This is a problem I've seemed to notice, though it isn't just on this platform. It seems that if you don't already have some knowledge on the topic or if your question comes from a different viewpoint than the poster, then the comment tends to go negative.

This isn't always the case, but it seems very common. Are the purposes of questions not to gather information? What would the world have ever become without questions? Even if people don't agree with the question or the question displays ignorance, shouldn't you try to explain why they're wrong rather than insult them and downvote/dislike/report them?

I bring up reporting not because I have been reported, but I know this does happen. I can also see that someone says something offensive (though in my eyes, I don't really care what people say.. Especially if it is online, where most things are trolls or jokes), but how else is the person supposed to ask? If they are not aware of the topic, how are they to use the proper language? I can understand if someone is being blatantly rude though, best to just not respond to that stuff or tell them why they're wrong, but in a calm manner.

Effectively, what I wish people to gather is this:
Before you get mad, try to explain where the other person went wrong and/or answer the question they posed. Questions are a great way to try to learn, using anger will only push people into extremes/isolation. To me, a world without questions is the saddest one there can be.

Also, argue with me if you disagree."

explainlikeimfive,fe4b7r8,t1_fe3d16o,1578857502.0,When did that start? I've only been away from those schools in Texas for 6 years. Dang.. 6 years? Didn't realize it's been so long until I wrote this.

YangForPresidentHQ,fdic2oh,t3_elekz4,1578439541.0,"I don't even know what I'm supposed to do tbh. How do you ""phone bank""? I really want him to win, but am I really going to be enough to help?"
news,fd7krbv,t3_ek5dyf,1578206022.0,"Well.. I first thought this was some standard left bs... But uh, yeah. That's a bit much dontchu think? I mean, we don't know the full story of course, but this is unsettling to say the least. I have doubt that the Muslim chick did anything to deserve that. I have learned to prevent premature judgement, hopefully justice is served.
 
People confuse me tbh. I get being annoyed at something from a different culture, but does it really matter? As long as it isn't something violent, in the human non-sport extent anyways, then leave people alone."

IAmA,fcy4vml,t3_ej5wwp,1578074828.0,"1. How do you feel when you see someone dressing like a Nazi in the modern day?
2. Were you at Stalingrad? If not, did you at least hear anything about it during wartime? I ask because my great-grandfather was there and I want to know what it was like being a part of something like that.
3. What would've happened if you refused to fight?
Sorry about so many questions."

changemyview,fc60o92,t1_fc5tknb,1577469664.0,"Maybe OP didn't see anything they wanted to argue about. Maybe the comment was more of a token saying ""I read what you said for the most part."""

AskReddit,fc0m5av,t1_fbzmf9g,1577294304.0,A lot are friendly but it isn't real. They may act like they want to hang out with you or something but they don't mean it.
AskReddit,fc0luy1,t1_fbzvn09,1577294070.0,A lot of Americans are fake tbh. That's why I shy away from people.
GetMotivated,fc0le5y,t3_eff5o8,1577293696.0,"I'm the opposite. People tell me they are proud of me for getting an associate's, keeping a basic job for 3 years, or being a great role model. I never know what to say other than ""Thanks."" In the meantime, I feel no genuine pride in my supposed accomplishments. I don't feel like I've done anything. This even applies to things people don't recognize, like my Minecraft version of a 3 input decoder or my 1.12.2 mod tool to generate an infinite number of items in Minecraft.

Not trying to get a pity party, just being honest. Kinda my thing, lol."

I mean.. There isn't evidence that someone could, we'll see how Dead Matter (still in development) pans out.. Though it probably isn't the exact thing I'd want either."
