DIY,ff22uzx,t3_emx9x2,1579492302.0,"Hello OP! My house has the same type of wood paneling you described, and I hate it. Its wall to wall in half the house. The house was built in 1965, so I assume its manufactured and its kinda bowed in a few spots, so I can tell its thin.

I want to paint over it, but Im not a DIYer (I can paint walls, but thats about it). What steps would I need to take to make it paintable? Sanding? Priming? What kind of paint? Any advice would be amazing!!"

aww,ff0tlmx,t1_ff0j40l,1579472160.0,"Nope, just a normal buildabear. Its a repost (pretty recent it looks like), so maybe thats why OP decided to call ot a pet store?"
IAmA,feo4so5,t1_femw9ba,1579295068.0,"Not OP, but I live in South Dakota and my family is in NC, FL, and CA. It is super expensive to fly out of Sioux Falls. I would probably take 3-5 short weekend type trips a year to visit family and just get out of the cold for a few days if it was cheaper. Right now, average ticket costs are around $300-$500 roundtrip per person and I have a family of 3. So our visits are limited to once every year or two. 

I know they have cheaper flights, but having to hunt for them can be time consuming. I'd love to see domestic flights such as those pop up in my email from y'all!"
puppies,fdlcasq,t1_fdjgeo5,1578520967.0,"And if it's anything like the one in my town, it has a basin the dog stands in with a non slip bottom and a chain to clip your dog to so they cant jump out either side! Its waist height so no bending over and ours only costs 7 dollars for 10 mins of wash and dry time!"
AdviceAnimals,fdfve0x,t1_fdfov4x,1578371231.0,My son's initials are ETC. That way he has a cool band name (et cetera) or baseball nickname (X) when he is a teenager but still have a normal adult name.
