fatlogic,ffwb2n6,t1_fftxi1x,1580293344.0,"I don't know about that.  I mean, yes, we all agree that your sister's partner should get serious about losing weight, but setting that aside, it's your sister who wants to go zip-lining.  It doesn't fall to her SO to participate in everything she wants to do.

Saying she doesn't want to go off alone in the Bahamas sounds feeble.  She's not going to be alone at the zip-line place.  There are other people on the cruise!  They're not just going to leave a passenger behind."
fatlogic,ffw8y0l,t1_ffup4i9,1580290127.0,"This one is interesting: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6635083/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6635083/pdf/nihms-1021396.pdf).  Daily weighers lost 1.68% of body weight over 12 months, vs 0.15% *gain* by weekly weighers, although the participants were not receiving any weight loss guidance and the study sample included a surprisingly large number of underweight people (431 of 1041).  Actually over half the weekly weighing group was underweight, so they may even have been intending to gain weight.  I kinda wish they'd restricted to overweight and obese participants."
fatlogic,ffw7jdn,t1_ffv2p6y,1580288045.0,"Looking at it again, it is kinda garbage.  There weren't two groups (there was apparently a delayed intervention control group, but the study doesn't say anything about what happened to them).  Everybody in the study group received the same intervention, i.e. they were told to weigh daily.  The division into daily weighers and others is based on their compliance with the instruction, hence the very high weighing frequency among the non-daily group.

I'm guessing that this ""secondary analysis"" was only published because the authors were struck by the facts that (a) the study group split almost exactly in half into those who weighed every day and those who didn't and (b) there was a dramatic difference in outcomes between these groups.

But as you say, it's really hard to think that skipping one or two daily weighings could cause such a significant difference in outcome.  On the other hand, it's easy to imagine that the half of the study group who successfully weighed themselves every day for 6 months are high in self discipline.

Somebody should run an a/b test where two groups each receive the same weight loss advice and networked scales, but one is told to weigh daily and the other to weigh weekly."

fatlogic,ffv3bao,t1_fftxsjd,1580254695.0,"That sounds like a good training schedule (although you could probably fit in another run at a steady pace, perhaps on Thursday).

I'm a guy, but I'm only an inch taller than you (and a few pounds lighter), and I eat about 3,000kcal/day for marathon training.  Honestly, I think you'd be more likely to lose 2lbs/week at 1,400kcal/day: it's far too high a deficit for effective training."
fatlogic,ffv1jel,t1_ffu1lg1,1580253549.0,"Yes, it seems pretty obvious that weighing would be more of a big deal if I only did it once a week."
fatlogic,ffv18rq,t1_ffup4i9,1580253357.0,"On the one hand, N=47.  On the other, 9.2kg vs 3.1kg mean weight loss after 6 months is a massive difference."

fatlogic,ffqo0mt,t1_ffqlrdu,1580139595.0,"I suspect that somewhere in the far distance the idea derives from Rubens' depictions of classical goddesses.  As such, there are two separate errors.  Firstly, Rubens' goddesses are a bit chubby, rather than obese (although I'm going to say the woman in Angelica and the Hermit is at least 40 pounds overweight).  Secondly, her dates are off by 300 hundred years."
fatlogic,ffonp9o,t3_euajnd,1580079642.0,">It's like looking at a smoker and telling them smoking is going to kill them.

It's exactly like that.  I literally say, ""It's going to kill you,"" when I see someone I know light a cigarette."
fatlogic,ffomow1,t3_eue41d,1580079251.0,"To state the obvious: the problem is that the ice cream does nothing to help you cope.  You have all the same problems as before, plus you've just eaten 100g of sugar and 50g of saturated fat."
fatlogic,ffoi5hx,t1_ffnrkv6,1580077828.0,"It seems to me that there is a tension between the public health and the individual perspective here (and elsewhere).  From a public health point of view, we have a bunch of interventions intended to reduce obesity.  They don't work.  We know they don't work, partly through studies like this one, but also because despite sustained efforts to tackle the obesity crisis, in the UK and elsewhere, it just keeps getting worse.  So we have a public health issue: we need better interventions.  As the paper says, ""Research to develop new and more effective approaches to obesity management is urgently required... \[I\]n the absence of effective interventions targeted at the individual level, the greatest opportunity for tackling the current obesity epidemic may be found outside primary care.""

But that doesn't mean that at an individual level ""over 95% will fail at \[losing weight\]"" (as stated in the OP).  The fact that people fail to lose weight despite repeatedly receiving diet advice from medical professionals doesn't meant that diets don't work (as you clearly understand), but that the patients are disregarding the advice.  We see on this very sub numerous examples of people who get sensible advice from their doctors, then take to social media to complain they're being oppressed.  Those are extreme of course, but we all know people who just ignore the sensible advice.  I was one of those people myself.  I believe it is partly the fault of this HAES nonsense: even people who are far from true believers pick up the idea that being a bit chubby isn't such a problem.

You know and I know and in their most secret hearts I think the fatlogicians know that weight loss is very simple, and that people who are sufficiently motivated to lose weight can do so without ever troubling their GP.  It's hard work and no-one can do it for you, but for an individual who does the work, it works."
fatlogic,ffkuxjy,t1_ffkmqy6,1580029381.0,"This is just an observational study, i.e. it finds that most obese people *don't* lose weight.  They effectively just picked a random bunch of people, didn't make any intervention, and checked back in on them over a decade.  But that just tells us what we already knew, since people by and large aren't getting any thinner.  It doesn't support the claim that obese people *can't* lose weight.  Like many people here, as a formerly obese person, I find that claim hard to believe."
fatlogic,ffks4m0,t3_eu1hbu,1580027912.0,"To be as fair as possible to this person, guessing from the height they're a man, those numbers give a BMR of 2,030kcal.  Plugging in a PAL of 1.49 gives a baseline TDEE of just over 3,000.  The claim is that they burn 4,000-4,500kcal/day *total* not from activity.  They need 1,000-1,500kcal/day of exercise.  At that weight they would burn maybe 165kcal/mile of running.  So they would need to run 6-9 miles/day, which is perfectly possible (and username is 'Jogger').  A 5'11"" man running 10 minute miles (which is slow, but our guy weighs 211lbs) does about 1,500 steps to the mile, so that's 9,000-13,500 steps of running, leaving sufficient steps for ordinary daily activity.

There are some problems with this, like nobody who runs 42-63 miles/week measures their distance in ""steps"" and frankly you would have to really work hard to maintain 211lbs body weight at that volume.

But his real problem is that he's massively underestimating his intake.  Lichtman et al found that ""diet-resistant"" individuals underestimated intake by an average of 47%, i.e. they reported an intake of just over half their actual intake, despite having received instruction from a dietician and keeping a daily food diary.  If our guy makes the mean error, his intake is 3,750-4,700kcal/day."
