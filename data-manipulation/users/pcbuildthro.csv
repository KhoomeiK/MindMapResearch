The term was popularized by the media shortly after a press conference given on June 18, 1971, by &**President Richard Nixon**—the day after publication of a special message from President Nixon to the Congress on Drug Abuse Prevention and Control—during which he declared drug abuse ""public enemy number one"". That message to the Congress included text about devoting more federal resources to the ""prevention of new addicts, and the rehabilitation of those who are addicted"", but that part did not receive the same public attention as the term ""war on drugs"".[11][12][13] However, two years prior to this, Nixon had formally declared a ""war on drugs"" that would be directed toward eradication, interdiction, and incarceration.[14]Today, the Drug Policy Alliance, which advocates for an end to the War on Drugs, estimates that the United States spends $51 billion annually on these initiatives.[15]
