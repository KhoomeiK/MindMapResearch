[This is the guy for those interested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani). 

He is the leader of Iran's Qud's Force which has operated with the Assad government in Syria for several years now. He is a member of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Pretty high ranking figure in Iran, who knows what the geopolitical ramifications of this will be.

It's kind of crazy how people identified his body based on a ring he wears often in public photos.


As for actual photos and things of that nature meeting with the heads of the publicly known Iran backed militia well I don't think my security clearance is high enough to see those. However, there have been numerous photos posted by the militia orchestrating those attacks that claim him as there ""leader"" I guess and I'm not searching all over for those not replying to everyone because there is a timer for that and I'm not waiting ten minutes per comment."
