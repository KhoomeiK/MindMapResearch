Also was good for the store as it meant people came back to return bottles and likely buy more stuff from them. And since glass shards are a hazard to step on, people were generally a bit more careful about leaving them wherever.

Though the one big downside is if one does break it can be virtually impossible to pick up all the pieces of it pending a change in the formulation to the glass (which might also make it not recyclable)"

You used to have to separate paper, cardboard, glass, plastic (#1 and 2) and aluminum.

Allowing you to tackle hunts in multiple different ways. Also if you aren't very good you can just prepare more consumables ahead of time. Whereas here you just get to fail until basically you overgear a fight enough to soak the hits required to finish your combos or expose yourself for the stuns you need.
dauntless,fe3topr,t1_fdw7wsj,1578852741.0,"It's just highlighting the core problems the game has always had: 

There is no threat table, every little hit staggers you for 3 secs, the damage window outside of stun and stagger is too small to finish even 1 combo rotation, animation locks are too long, too many behemoths are super flighty, their hitboxes are tiny/weapons have pitiful range, healing choices in the game are too few and too weak, etc."
dauntless,fe3rxfy,t1_fdy61pg,1578852271.0,"Part of the problem is core to the game though IMHO.

My guess would be that since spinning disk storage has long since hit diminishing returns, it will take longer to appreciably ramp up sizes in that form factor. IE: Adding 400gb per platter to one with 8 platters is already 2TB bigger vs. a 9.5mm where it may only have 1-2 platters in total."

The length of them means you basically can't react in melee range, you have to proactively know their pattern and avoid attacking in order to dodge in time. Or save the lantern shield since that's instant I suppose.

Also the lack of range on most weapons. I swear the Warpike has shorter range than the primary attack for Chain Blades, which doesn't make any sense. Makes it really frustrating on highly mobile bosses, as even the charge sprint isn't all that fast to gap close."

Same with the bag bans or charging for them: The felt bags use the same resources as like 100 plastic bags yet studies show on average only get used 1-2 dozen times before ripping and can't be recycled.

IE: When to wait for traffic even if technically you could go but it looks like people are acting erratically.

As someone in the US who still enjoys driving a manual, it's frustrating that it's getting really hard to find one even on sports cars these days. Unfortunately the hybrid tranmissions aren't the same because they put restrictions on what RPMs you can shift at even in ""manual mode"". So sometimes they won't let you shift yet, and other times it forces a shift to the next gear. And while the automatics are better these days than they used to be, they still do supremely stupid shifting choices fairly often IMHO.

Especially in hilly or mountainous terrain, having a manual is way better than an automatic. You can use engine braking or coasting in neutral easily to avoid glassing your brakes, etc. Or when snowing engine braking doesn't lock up your wheels like braking, which is even better than modern stability control.

The cherry on top is a number of cars have manual options in EU but not the NA version. eg: Volvo S60"
