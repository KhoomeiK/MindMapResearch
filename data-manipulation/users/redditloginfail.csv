Seems like a shortsighted business move on their part if true, though."

TheCinemassacre,ff49gc2,t1_ff3z5hb,1579558443.0,Issue #1 was an epic event for me. I remember it well.
patientgamers,ff1jbib,t1_fen4q4r,1579480112.0,Interesting. I just game on console for the time being but I'll keep it in the back of my mind for later.
patientgamers,ff1j1ff,t1_fen1m67,1579479989.0,I'll look into it!
patientgamers,fez7krg,t1_fex80s6,1579454506.0,Yeah definitely not the game for you.  Most of those things were plusses for me

politics,fejhgpk,t1_fe5gy0l,1579174434.0,"Because the 1800s are the same as the 2000s and everything will be just fine?  Cuz there was also artificial intelligence hundreds of years ago?  Invisible hand fix everything magically?

Sorry I'm just frustrated with this argument. I just think the head in the sand approach..... isn't working."
MGTOW2,fejg784,t3_epexne,1579172721.0,"""Love"" is used pretty loosely.  In the moment people feel certain things but really biology is just driving us to a conclusion. Women really want to extract resources. Men really want to spread their genes.  

Since we have the curse/gift of consciousness all these layers get added on top of it.  Kind of like religion.  We have the instinct to stay alive and the fear of death, so over the years people added story on top of story to assuage that fear (and make some bucks off of shmucks.)"
MGTOW2,fejfht4,t3_epebbn,1579171691.0,"Well now you know what to expect.  Find something else to do with your life. Don't waste time interacting with bar hoes (or church hoes, office hoes, etc.)"

patientgamers,fedkr5j,t3_eoijhy,1579013967.0,"I definitely think this is the case for REALLY old games, like Ultima 5 on PC. Basically stick figures, but it engages your imagination more like how a book does.

And if characters are more cartoony/abstracted it's natural for us to be able to identify with them more. Think Calvin and Hobbes vs Prince Valiant. 

Damn I've got some old references here."
wiiu,fecf8o0,t3_eodgxv,1578972501.0,Used ones in good shape on ebay I'd say. The one i got off there works great. A lot of people didn't use their wiis a lot.

As far as a philosophy of independence, no particular candidate is the best.  And regarding libertarians, i think they would just cede power to corporations which would lead to a neo feudalism.  

I'm rooting for Yang.  I lost all faith in conservatives a while back.  Don't trust corporate Democrats either.  But he seems to give a shit about working class guys (and gals).

Oh and I can't stand the alt right or sjw whiners."

depression,fd583u7,t3_ejw74l,1578175066.0,"High school being the ""best time of your life"" is nonsense. You're in a stressful, uncertain time period of your life right now, so your feelings make sense, but are not accurate. 

Play your cards right and you won't have to spend your life slaving away, either.  

FWIW, i was way happier at my 40th birthday than my 30th.  You can't predict a downhill slide.  Be glad you're out of high school.  Learn a trade that's semi interesting, make some bucks, have some fun, keep life simple."

MGTOW2,fcu150i,t3_eik9gg,1577969000.0,"Interesting article, thanks for posting!  I know the libertarians here won't like it though.  I've been thinking a lot lately how an advanced market based economy gradually decays all of human experience. Everything is a transaction. Everything is a competition. It's every man for himself.

And on the flip side, (actual) authoritarian socialism decays humanity, but rapidly.  I don't see any good solutions for modern man."
MGTOW2,fctvonf,t1_fcrd12i,1577961929.0,"Interesting analysis.  I'd like to see conservatism inc go down.  Political predictions are a dime a dozen though but it's fun, like horse races."

depression,fca5du8,t3_egqg5d,1577563301.0,"""Comparison is the thief of joy.""

I make a point of arranging my life to avoid the keep up with the joneses materialistic mindset.  Kind of a tricky thing to do in the modern world. Success is worshipped to the point of a gross sexual fetish. 

I mostly avoid Facebook aside from making jokes here and there that i think relatives will enjoy.

Also the success stories i like to watch are YouTube videos of abandoned dogs that are taken in and rehabilitated and become happy and healthy.  Pump that sort of stuff into your brain.

In general to be mentally healthy i separate myself from the mindset and expectations of society. I don't socialize much, aside from with dogs and old people. It helps tremendously.

I hope that helps.  I've been in your shoes of feeling miserable and lethargic for yeeeears."
