nashville,ffcrxa3,t3_esx9ja,1579806011.0,"Mimi’s has a location in Murfreesboro and their corn chowder is pretty tasty, although the rest of their food has been pretty “meh” the last couple of times I’ve been."
fatlogic,ff5wkwy,t3_erotwi,1579612669.0,"In the U.S. you’d have to be pretty enormous to even register as “big” compared to other patrons in most restaurants.  Like, you’d have to be “my 600 lb life” sized.  My perception might be a little thrown off because I used to work at a pizza buffet but the point still stands."
52weeksofcooking,ff1rmre,t1_ff1gx4a,1579484650.0,I’m definitely trying this!  Do you know why the recipe calls for the water to be boiled then cooled?  I can’t see any reason why it would mess something up to skip that step and save time but maybe I’m missing something.
AskWomen,fezh440,t3_eqxh1o,1579457277.0,I was 19 ten years ago and only had like two close female friends and maybe two or three acquaintances that I cared to keep up with in any capacity.  Now I have four women I'd consider to be close friends and nearly ten in my wider friend group that I keep up with and care about.  I didn't connect with other girls in high school very well and was very socially awkward in general.  When I got to college and started taking engineering courses and meeting other female engineers it was like I found my people and started making a lot of friends.
BuyItForLife,fepbtkc,t3_eq722d,1579316696.0,"If you can’t find the gloves you’re looking for, maybe look for jackets or shirts with thumb holes in the sleeves.  I have a ski jacket that has cuffs that extend from the lining of the jacket about halfway up my palm with a thumb hole and with some gloves on top of that it’s perfect.  And you could get the same effect with thumb-holed long sleeve shirt underneath."
AskWomen,fep44fd,t1_fen26zt,1579311704.0,The first time a recipe called for shallots I thought it was dumb to have to buy another thing instead of just using the onions I had at home but something compelled me to go ahead and get them anyway.  Holy crud was I happy I did.  Shallots are in like a whole other flavor dimension.
fatlogic,fehsqkd,t1_fehmd22,1579123127.0,This right here. It sucks to be overweight. It sucks more to be overweight in clothes that ride up and cut into you because they don’t fit right.
atheism,fe6c148,t1_fe6bkln,1578886600.0,"I call those people “Christian by default” because that’s basically what I was until I realized/admitted I was at the very least agnostic.  It feels weird and like a big step to “choose” atheism when you’ve been raised differently even if you’re not a practicing Christian. Heck, my mom hasn’t been to a church service in probably a decade and she cried when I told her I wasn’t having a pastor officiate my wedding."
Knoxville,fe2m6h4,t1_fe227si,1578840396.0,"Their ramen was good, but I also got some skewers and felt like the portion sizes were awfully small for what I paid though they were tasty.  This was also during lunch so maybe their dinner portions are better."
fatlogic,fdw75c4,t1_fdw2z48,1578755784.0,I aspire to a level of “extra” where I have the foresight to do things like hide streamers around the house for a pity party.
AbandonedPorn,fdn1zxl,t3_elz5ti,1578574869.0,The chalkboard by the autopsy table is pretty cool. I don’t think I’ve seen something like that before.
nashville,fdko3qz,t3_elwclx,1578507610.0,You’re probably gonna have to find a small-time landlord who may not advertise online as pretty much any big rental company has a two dog limit.  Some friends of mine had good luck just driving around the areas they were considering and looking for “for rent” signs.
fatlogic,fddq64j,t1_fddcfv0,1578321004.0,"Yep, that’s what it is.  My sister occasionally wears shirts like this because of fat liberation of something and it looks ridiculous."
HumansBeingBros,fd7bz0o,t3_ek6rb0,1578202148.0,I'm suuuper glad online grade books weren't a thing when I was in school.  I made good grades but I was constantly stressing about it so I know I would've been obsessively checking for updates.
AskWomen,fd6lfag,t1_fd4lc18,1578192729.0,"Okay, I'm very curious- were you told why your doctor thought at the time you'd be unable to have kids?  Because obviously you're waay on the other end of the fertile spectrum."
52weeksofcooking,fcwg68a,t1_fcv9tm7,1578024779.0,You could also do a peach cobbler!
AskReddit,fcv4hss,t1_fcv23se,1577994470.0,Same here- I lived in New Mexico for about a year for my job and I swear I didn’t stop itching the whole time I was there no matter how much lotion I used.
aww,fc7m32m,t1_fc7jmd8,1577511900.0,"I mean, she’s not wrong"
BadMUAs,fc5cnbe,t1_fbql60d,1577453424.0,I got coverage about like that using  Ben Nye shadow with a wet brush for a costume years ago.
fatlogic,fbyzwbo,t3_ef5220,1577230945.0,"I’ve been watching a dietician on YouTube who has a lot of good points, but is for some reason super against calorie counting and pushes intuitive eating for everybody.  I don’t know her whole story and struggle (I know she’s talked before about dealing with orthorexia) but it amazes me that she doesn’t realize that not everybody’s intuition is good or well-calibrated."
