TheDollop,ffaasrn,t1_ffa9xtc,1579731251.0,"Dream bigger friend. There was a time that people thought bringing down the power of monarchies was impossible. We're facing a climate catastrophy and mass extinction. The time has come for drastic, unfeasible action and hand wringing isn't doing anything. It definitely wasn't socialists who caused this but socialism is better equipped to deal with the outcomes."

BlackWolfFeed,feuu4io,t1_feupsnv,1579389929.0,Thank you friend. I will be leaving this up to show my shame to the world
BlackWolfFeed,feui3kt,t1_fete19z,1579386744.0,"It will be three more dollars in Bernie's coffers, one more unique donation, and help him win the nom. Stop nitpicking and just donate. We've got a big opportunity rn and this kind of pedantic bullshit might help blow it."
TheDollop,feuh0vx,t3_eqjnn7,1579386504.0,And then he'd say a bunch of olde tymie racial slurs while asking why black people are in the same spaces as white people and asking who they belong to since homeboy loved slavery.
todayilearned,fepch81,t1_fep6jcb,1579317137.0,The specific form and technique that the US military uses was developed during mk ultra. I wasn't trying to say he was but the part of the program that he was in was also the one that they experimented with waterboarding
todayilearned,fenhmji,t1_fenh1go,1579284876.0,"I'll have to dig it up, I have an article saved that confirmed his professor was working with the CIA and one of the documents saved had a reference to a subject codenamed LAWFUL which was kaczynski's codename."
todayilearned,fen11og,t1_femm3sv,1579274579.0,"Nah, he wasn't part of the acid experiments of mk ultra. He was part of the straight up torture and breaking a human brain just through stress part. Fun fact - that part of the program is also where we learned waterboarding from. Isn't. That. Fun."

ADHD,fdsq3p0,t1_fdsmsnc,1578706483.0,Legitimately and unironically inspiring. Def not gunna graduate before I turn 30 but I'm also not really going for a straight forward degree. I'm a US history major but I want to get into making documentaries. Not many programs for doing that specifically but I can assemble the skills needed

I know a lot about the American and European colonial side but that's about it. That being said, we should raise Allende from the dead and give him a mech suit.

philadelphia,fdbyrk4,t1_fd9vn7h,1578264002.0,"The problem I have with demonstrations like this is that they really don't do anything. Sure, they are good for networking with other like minded people. The problem is, if they aren't being disruptive then it really won't do anything. Now if there was some serious property damage or the occupation of a building or two that might get Toomey, Casey, or any of our reps to actually listen and maybe think twice about voting for an escalation of some sort."
philadelphia,fdby0ix,t1_fd9xmy9,1578263604.0,You should check out a little book called War is a Racket by the most decorated Marine in US history and former Director of Public Safety (the police commissioner in the 20s) Smedly Darlington Butler. He did some horrible shit as a grunt but more than made up for it while he was the brigadier general of the USMC and even thwarted a coup against FDR that was being planned by JP Morgan and known nazi sympathizer Prescott Bush.
