todayilearned,ff8dnwa,t1_ff7x4ov,1579674145.0,"Wolfenstein was insanely ahead of its time. Basically the first stealth game. Guards would patrol and not pursue you until you crossed their line of sight. If you snuck up on one with your gun drawn (even if you were out of bullets!) you could mug them. Guards would react to dead bodies, so you could drag bodies out of the way. There were locked chests that you could slowly lockpick, or take a chance and just shoot the lock... which could end badly if the chest contained explosives! If you found a uniform, you could put it on and guards would ignore you. If you found grenades, you could use them to blast holes in the walls. The castle layout was randomly generated, so every game was different. Just amazing stuff. Also one of the earliest games to use digitized speech.

The only thing I hated about it was that you took damage from walking into walls, which was way too easy due to how clunky the movement was."

People talk by flinging words back and forth. That's the bedrock truth. Any conversation system fit for use across an entire game must necessarily be abstract enough to encompass all of what you consider different ways of talking.

Typing in a game sucks. Even if it didn't suck, it devolves into keyword-hunting. Robust conversation AIs don't exist. Gamified abstractions of conversation aren't immersive. Many game designs demand that the PC somehow be able to converse with the NPCs. At the confluence of all these limitations we have the current mini-*choose your own adventure* state of conversation systems. This isn't complicated. Walking and talking are both necessarily abstracted into something manageable with finite development time and a handful of buttons. Deal."
