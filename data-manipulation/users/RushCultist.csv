LetsNotMeet,ffar89h,t1_ffahiza,1579742609.0,He/she probably didn’t want to lead them to their house. It’s usually common sense if you’re being followed because if they have really bad intentions they might follow up by breaking in some other time. Ofc I’m not OP but that was my thought reading this.

AskReddit,feduhvo,t3_eonevv,1579020163.0,"My first girlfriend was 17, I was 14. We had only been officially dating for two weeks, but we had definitely been together for longer than that we just didn’t want to rush into things because of the age gap. So two weeks in, we sneak out after school, she parks her car in a deserted parking lot, and climbs on my lap in the passenger seat. We begin to make out and then she says “there’s more room in the backseat.” We move back there and soon clothes are coming off. She was on her period so she just sucked me off and gave me hand jobs and we made out. About halfway through I notice someone standing RIGHT NEXT TO THE CAR. Not looking in, just looking around. It turns into a few people that I guess were cleaning up the parking lot to be good samaritans. We grab a blanket and put our shirts on and put on Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage on her phone. Once the people leave we get back at it and she double checks and turns out she’s not on her period after all so I finger her and then we have sex. I didn’t have to pull out as she was already on the pill. One of the most amazing experiences of my life to date. She was very respectful of my boundaries and made sure I was comfortable with what we were doing. Still dating a few months later."

It’s hard for her to complain about this, because people just see the 300 lb dad with an autoimmune disorder that needs help, not the emotionally abusive, neglective father that won’t take care of himself and expects his daughter to do it for him."
AskReddit,fdu7kqz,t1_fdtdsie,1578728968.0,"I don’t think they’re expecting you to pay. They provide the opportunity for you to pay but it’s more about playing music and doing what you love in public for an audience than money. As a musician, I highly contest the idea that music isn’t a “real job.” What matters is that they’re doing what they love, NOT whether or not you can exploit their ability for profit."

Cringetopia,fdseo8a,t3_emq6u1,1578700979.0,What’s really stupid is it probably wasn’t even a baby it was probably an embryo the size of a sesame seed without any consciousness at all. Barely more than a clump of genetic material. Pro-birthers/anti-choice people try to push the narrative that they’re “killing babies” but they’re not. IF YOU STOMP ON AN ANT YOU’VE KILLED SOMETHING GENETICALLY MORE COMPLEX THAN WHAT MOST ABORTIONS GET RID OF. I don’t understand how people can’t wrap their heads around this fact.
