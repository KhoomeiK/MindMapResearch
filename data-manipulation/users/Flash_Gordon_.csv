premed,ffiri0v,t1_ffilj4x,1579980889.0,"Well I make a lot of points in my comment but to address the quality of the classes I’ve taken: 

I actually transferred after my freshman year from an OK state school to a school near Ivy League level. I think the quality of the teaching has been pretty much the same. At the end of the day, how much you learn will depend on how much work you put into it and if you actually enjoy what you’re learning. 

Going to a good school of course has its perks: there may be more opportunities to do research, network, just more opportunities in general. 

With that said, going to a good school also has its downsides. It’s going to be more expensive to attend compared to more affordable in-state tuition. Classes are going to be graded on a curve, and going to a better school means the competition will be a lot more intense. Getting an A in organic chem at a really good school is harder than at a state school because of this reason. Not because the class is harder/easier, but because the level of competition you face 

That’s why I think for medical school admission. You are better off going to a school you think you can succeed at rather than struggle for A’s at a better school.

premed,ff4nuzv,t3_erf8q4,1579568161.0,"The school you went to means nothing. Honestly, in terms of the quality of the education you are receiving, there is not much difference between a good state school and an Ivy. Organic chemistry is still organic chemistry. Not like you are learning “secret knowledge” of chemistry at Cornell like you wouldn’t somewhere at X state university. 

Now, going to an Ivy would be important if you wanted to go into something like finance where the connections/networking is super important. 

Med school admittance, although it claims to be “holistic”, is one of the most meritocratic processes out there and that is why I appreciate and respect it so much. Unless you know the dean of the med school you are applying to, your connections and alma mater aren’t going to mean much in the end if you have a 3.3 gpa
