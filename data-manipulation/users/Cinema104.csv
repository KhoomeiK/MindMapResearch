Heading Eastbound on Mt Baker Hwy, turn left on Silver Lake Rd in Maple Falls (town), and park next to the church on the right with the tall slanted roof. You have to meander through some overgrowth off the main trail to get to the falls but its a short and easy walk."

dogs,fclj39s,t3_eho07v,1577748969.0,"The underlying cause of depression/fatigue needs to be addressed. For me, having a dog changed everything, because it gave me a reason to go hiking and take on new hobbies. My old life in the city was pretty boring and grey, but now I love life and look forward to hiking adventures with the pup and engaging in photography. 
If your depression/fatigue is caused by a significant vitamin deficiency or chemical imbalance, I wouldn’t rely on just a dog to get you through the hard times. You may need psychiatric or nutritional help. Sometimes it is caused by something that is embedded in your life that you’re not conscious of yet, and therapy can help bring it to your attention so it can be properly addressed. A dog may help you through this process, but may not be a cure-all."

It took a month to recover enough just to walk him. I could hardly look at him because he wasn’t her. I was heartbroken. Then I walked him, and he was SO happy, it made me happy. Now he’s the reason I hike and take pictures and go exploring with him all the time. I’m still devastated at the loss of my girl. He will never be her, but I love him for him. He’s a goofball and I’m his biggest fan. Grief takes time. Give yourself time."

Bellingham,fccggqo,t1_fcc9ze7,1577598114.0,"Agreed. Some people just shouldn't have dogs, especially when it comes to certain breeds. Not all dog breeds are created equal. I voluntarily disqualified myself from owning pit breeds because of how strong they are. I don't feel confident if something goes awry. Shepherds, collies, and high energy breeds are similar and end up being returned to the shelter or acting out because their owner's are not experienced or designed to own such a high maintenance dog. I've met plenty of shep owners that really are better off with a little dog. IMO, if you need a shock collar or prong to control your dog, you need to ""downsize"" and go for a smaller more physically manageable breed."

Personally, I wouldn't own that breed because of the liability and how strong they are. However, if a dog (regardless of breed) is well-behaved, I would mind my own business and not go out of my way to make someone feel uncomfortable for owning it. Calling it vicious when it is behaving itself is just weird and nosey and uncalled for. Like that lady that had a tantrum and scolded me in line at the post office for looking at my iPhone, cause too many young people are on their phones. Just weird, boundary issues."

I don't know where you're getting that information. Regardless of if its true or false, if a dog has a high prey drive and has killed deer it needs to be on a leash at all times. That behavior is unacceptable here."
