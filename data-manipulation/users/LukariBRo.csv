This is the key part of the rationale behind it and why it could be either a saving grace for the company or something that exists to only exploit the worker in the end. 

If a company was struggling to be profitable and needed to just keep going for a while, that money ""saved"" could be huge. But when the company is already profitable, it's just a way to tell people ""you're essential and we're happy to have required you to work an unhealthy amount. Thanks for increasing our profits and executive bonuses even further"".

I'd like to see the system change to make sure salaried workers can't be exploited to further boost profits. Maybe leave the ability for companies to require people to work beyond that 40ish hours mark without it costing them extra if there truly isn't the money to pay extra. But, salaried people should have to get paid a premium beyond that if the company makes a profit around the time that happens. 

Sure, people can say to that ""they willingly signed up for that"" but that argument is entirely invalid in the context of overlap labor contracts because people are economically coerced to accept, and that's why we have labor laws in the first place."
