Bi means attraction to two or more genders, pan means attraction to all genders (sometimes feeling attraction regardless of gender). 

I consider myself bi/pan in queer spaces, because bi was my first label and it means a lot to me, but I am attracted to all genders, just in different ways, so both bi and pan fit. 

Outside of queer spaces though, I use bi exclusively, because I don't want to spend my whole life explaining how one can identify with two sexualities at the same time. 

So while there is overlap, there are definitely bi people who are not pan (someone attracted to women and nonbinary people, but not men, for example). There's also pan people who are uncomfortable identifying as bi, because they feel it erases a part of their sexuality.

I don't know if this will help, but now I'm 23, in a happy and loving relationship, having just graduated with a degree I love. This experience does not mean your life is thrown off track forever.

Sleep paralysis also can make you afraid of sleeping, and it can make it hard to get enough sleep. When this happens, your brain starts blurring between reality and dreams. Lack of sleep causes hallucinations, even in totally normal and healthy people.

As I always ask: did you start any medication around the time that this began? Sleep paralysis and night terrors can be a side effect of a lot of different meds

bipolar,fek6c1g,t1_fejy8ed,1579193527.0,"Yeah, this sounds right. There are some Antipsychotics that can help with mania too, but the effects tend to worse. Lithium and Depakote sound like good options."
Parenting,fek3j5v,t3_epk3rp,1579191847.0,"You mentioned that he vomited, was he hyperventilating? Because that would suggest that he was having a panic attack. Mine started at 6 or 7 and had similar focuses & triggers. You should probably talk to his doctor about play therapy"
Psychosis,feirpf7,t1_feire1c,1579145515.0,"Withdrawal should be mostly non-existant as long as you titrate off it. Might make you depressed, though."
bipolar,feirmq2,t1_feiqxkw,1579145463.0,"Mania is not just happy, it can also be anger or anxiety. Mine is almost entirely anger and anxiety, with very little happiness. So I think that's probably just still mania. 

The depression thing is strange, though. Might be a mixed episode, but with mostly just depression? I'm not sure. You should definitely read up on mixed episodes, though.

And your old doc was very very wrong. People w/ bipolar can absolutely have multiple mood changes in a day. When I'm mixed I switch literally hour to hour. *Most* people experience only longer episodes, but short ones aren't unheard of."
Psychosis,feiqbnr,t1_feiotde,1579144557.0,"I'm so sorry. SSRIs inducing mania is, according to my psychiatrist, enough for a diagnosis of bipolar on its own. Its how I was diagnosed. 

Why can't he do testing himself? Psychiatrists have always done my testing..."
bipolar,feiptjq,t3_ep8eev,1579144215.0,"I noticed nearly immediately, but had to stop it for health reasons shortly after. I have friends who noticed week one and friends who noticed month 3. Seems to be a person-to-person thing."

bipolar,feiou3z,t3_ep7rx0,1579143549.0,"Yes, it's definitely a Bipolar thing, and when they call it mood switching, they are saying the same thing you are. you are going from depression to mania in either a ""rapid cycling"" way or a ""mixed episode"" way. I basically live inside mixed episodes -- they're when you experience some symptoms of mania and some of depression simultaneously."
bipolar,feillsx,t3_ep9d15,1579141392.0,"First, get a new pilldoc since this one won't listen to you. Second, you'll need to taper. Quitting any psych meds cold turkey is a recipe for disaster -- your symptoms will likely come back worse than when you started them, if you're at all higher than the starting dose."
Psychosis,feikvb8,t1_fehi5a4,1579140892.0,"Hey, if SSRIs like Zoloft made you manic or hypomanic you should mention it to your psychiatrist -- it happens to most people with bipolar (and is how I got diagnosed) and can make psychosis worse."
