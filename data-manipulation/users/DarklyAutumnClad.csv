It's the lousy blower cooler. Not the chip kicking the asses of the 5700XT owners, also companies like XFX and these neuro-divergent THICC coolers.  Like, damn jackie."

wholesomememes,fezk4r6,t1_feyep4u,1579458191.0,"Same, My old man was always particular over my 11 month older than me brother. He treated him like gold, and treated me like trash. I could expect to be show something he got by him, while father hadn't considered me or my feelings. An indicator of how he treated me was that my brother had his own 28"" color television, and when that broke, he got him another 28"" color television, had the newest game consoles, while I had the ones he had lost interest in, and while all of the while I had a 13"" Black and White Sylvania until I was 15 years old, while my brother had a color TV for as long as I can remember.  He got my brother a gameboy, and got me nothing, my brother who loved me, traded some things that he had, with a weird girl who liked him in 4th grade, (but hated me) so that I could have a gameboy too.

10th gen part for sale on newegg, the 10920X, the 10th generation HEDT part. It consumes 500W on OC, and just over 389 normal.

You are either uninformed, or willfully ignorant, possibly both, because there's the gorram proof. It's also 749.00 and is slower than the 3950X, and more expensive. That's a 10th gen product right there.

Intel sucks because of 14nm OC. Every processor since the haswell refresh has been minor improvement OC on 14nm. The only think 10th gen brings to the table is improved avx, 512."

Well over 30 major games in the last 20 years have representation of LGBTQ characters, many of the AAA games from large studios."
gaming,fe5iji3,t1_fe56r1c,1578869874.0,"Yeah, you can usually tell that it's either pandering, but when they do this to established heterosexual characters, the PC term is ""Queerwashing"", which amounts to changing characters in fandom to be LGBTQ+, after the fact. It's basically just annoying to people who are already in the fandom, because it's not relevant at all. It's like if Master Chief stopped killing the covenant to bone a chick, not relevant. For instance, some LGBTQ+ kid was asking why Spider man cannot be a homosexual. Kid and community started a thing against Stan Lee saying he didn't deserve recognition, that he was bigot. They left out that he said, Spider man couldn't be a homosexual, because he was written canonically to be in love Mary Jane. Another irritating thing that is done now is backlash if there is any tension between characters of the same sex, they call it queerbaiting, if there is any tension between characters of the same sex, that they want to see together. Not everything is actually homoerotic subtext, but you generally find what you are looking for if you are looking hard enough.  


Basically, if it's not necessary to know the sexual preference of the character, I don't want to know, because I just don't care. How that is not the end game for LGBTQ+ is beyond me. No one cares anymore. Create a media stack for yourselves, you're outnumbered 9:1 on the planet. If the character is gay, that's okay, as long as you don't erase or modify cannon to do so."
