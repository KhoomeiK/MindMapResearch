schizoaffective,ffeno9s,t3_eswvcr,1579856181.0,"I was diagnosed with depression until doctors saw me have a manic episode, and it was switched to bipolar.  When they saw me experience a psychotic episode outside of a mood episode, it was switched to schizoaffective bipolar type.  Unfortunately IME doctors hesitate to believe things until they actually see it first hand.  I'm sorry you're suffering."
bipolar,ffb4ff7,t3_esmyw5,1579751519.0,Typically every 2-4 weeks when things are going alright.  If I'm doing poorly then it's weekly (or even multiple times per week when it's been really bad).  I think the frequency is partly because I don't currently see a therapist or any other mental health professional.
bipolar,ffaudvp,t3_eskbxn,1579744709.0,The savings card on their website is real.  It brings my copay from $60 to $15.
bipolar,ff7oare,t3_erzwgw,1579654346.0,I love it!  I've always wanted to try making my own clothes.  It's such a cool and useful skill to have.
bipolar,ff7o3kz,t3_erwy9c,1579654205.0,"Vraylar helps tremendously for my psychosis (schizoaffective here).  It does not manage my mood at all though.  I've been on it for a few years now, and I don't have any significant side effects from it.  It's a miracle med for me.  It was rough getting on it because it caused crazy insomnia, but that passed within a few weeks.

Latuda did nothing for me.  I don't remember much about the side effects because I tried it a long time ago.

I tried trintellix for anxiety.  It helped a lot for that, but it also made me feel really nauseous all the time, so I went off of it."
bipolar,ff6o721,t1_ff61nf9,1579631385.0,for what it's worth
bipolar,ff5hwmh,t3_erpmej,1579593633.0,"Get food poisoning.  Kidding, but that's what's keeping me from doing reckless manic things tonight.  Tomorrow I'm going to stock up on artsy craftsy stuff with the hope that projects will keep me occupied AT HOME and away from potentially dangerous or detrimental temptations.  If you don't have an artsy craftsy hobby, I'd recommend a cross stitch kit.  They are easy, relatively cheap, and time consuming.

Oh and please call your doctor as soon as you can!"
bipolar,ff5hmfm,t3_erpi84,1579593267.0,"I'd definitely ask.  My doctor is usually pretty receptive when I tell him I've researched xyz for whatever symptoms.  They might say no, but it's worth asking for sure."
bipolar,ff5aalh,t3_erp23o,1579585041.0,"I asked my psychiatrist for a letter and he wrote one immediately.  It was that easy for me.  This is a ""no animals"" building, but my landlord allowed my cat because of it.  FWIW though, landlords can still reject ESAs.  The laws are pretty hazy because the ESA concept is so new."
schizophrenia,ff57ph8,t3_erefw4,1579582666.0,"I've done my fair share of drugs, and none of them feel like psychosis IME"
bipolar,ff56dpg,t3_erokrf,1579581521.0,"Remember that if you truly do hate them, you can always go off (or ideally switch).  Good luck."
bipolar,ff55fh9,t3_ermw4i,1579580744.0,That's beautiful!!  I like cross stitching too :)
schizophrenia,ff39q6w,t1_ff366me,1579536989.0,"I don't, sorry.  I didn't look at the form."
bipolar,ff2lrww,t3_er8fcu,1579512192.0,"One psychiatrist refused to diagnose me with bipolar because per the DSM, mania cannot be diagnosed if someone is using drugs.  I described what I KNEW were manic episodes, but I was smoking weed during them, so he said he couldn't make the diagnosis.  I've never heard of weed inducing mania, but mmk.  It wasn't until he witnessed me having a manic episode sans marijuana that I was believed and diagnosed.

IME, treatment professionals are hesitant to diagnose solely based on patient report.  They have to actually see it happen, which kind of sucks."
schizoaffective,ff2lhrg,t3_er6qze,1579511771.0,That's awesome.  Way to go.  You should feel really proud of yourself.
schizoaffective,ff2lfjy,t3_er3l7s,1579511680.0,"I've had some episodes of paranoia, but nothing too severe.  I've also been having a lot of random rage outbursts which isn't so fun (not directed at anyone, but I'll punch my mattress or throw things at nothing or sob or whatever, you know the deal).  Not sure what that's about.  I started classes last week, and I'm pretty excited about school for once because my classes are interesting.

I'm glad you feel good :)"
schizophrenia,ff2l7ot,t3_er61u0,1579511355.0,"I like crocheting, cross stitching, and other fiber arts, though I rarely engage in them anymore tbh"
schizophrenia,ff2l2x6,t3_er40xg,1579511159.0,"It might have been me who posted that.  It's called handicapped dependent or disabled dependent depending on the insurance company.  I didn't know about it until my psych told me about it.  My dad contacted the insurance company, got a form, my dad and psych both filled parts out, and now I'm on my parents' insurance indefinitely with a yearly review.  Ask your psych about it, or call the insurance company (though mine said my dad had to call, they couldn't give me the info because he's the primary person on it).  I had to do it within a month of turning 26 though."
schizophrenia,fezkz4p,t3_eqvjqx,1579458438.0,"My psych doesn't make me do therapy, but I do see him every 2-4 weeks"
bipolar,fezhq9b,t3_eqxm1n,1579457459.0,very cute
bipolar,fewzkjw,t3_eqqy2w,1579421912.0,"I don't know how quickly it progresses, but I'd definitely get in with someone asap to talk about it.  I've gotten twitchy like that before from meds, and doctors have always taken it really seriously."
bipolar,fewz5du,t3_eqto8k,1579421723.0,"I was so severely depressed that I was about to have ECT, then olanzapine pulled me out of it.  It worked really well for managing my mood for a long time, but then I switched meds because it stopped controlling my psychosis (schizoaffective here).  I did gain weight on it, and it's the only med I've ever gained weight on.  The sedating effects wore off within a few weeks for me."
bipolar,fewwgir,t3_eqskya,1579420551.0,"I used to go to DBSA (depression bipolar support alliance).  Everyone there was really kind and supportive, and I liked the way it was led.  It was split into different groups like young adults, mania, depression, dual diagnosis, family and friends, etc.  The group leaders were all peer leaders.  I was struggling mostly with psychosis when I went (I have schizoaffective bipolar type), and I still felt very welcome.  The only reason I stopped going is because it meets pretty far from where I live, but I have nothing but positive things to say about DBSA."
schizophrenia,fewvt0v,t1_fewvhin,1579420271.0,"Yeah I'm not too worried, it is what it is, just wondering if anyone else here relates :)"
schizophrenia,fewvmuz,t3_eq9uzc,1579420194.0,"Way to go!!  I'm 26 and in undergrad right now.  IME colleges tend to be extra accommodating to older students, so don't be afraid to talk to your advisor or professors if you are struggling with anything.  Good luck!"
schizophrenia,fewv1fl,t3_eqpx1i,1579419929.0,"What helps me is writing lists of what I'm grateful for.  Big things, small things, even really basic things like access to clean water.  It helps."
schizophrenia,fewto6w,t3_eqqjh7,1579419328.0,"I have schizoaffective bipolar type, so I've had a lot of manic episodes in my life.  One was particularly severe and it lasted about 6 months.  I did and said a LOT of things that I felt very deep shame and guilt about for a long, long time.  It sounds really cheesy, but time helps.  I still cringe sometimes even years later, but it doesn't eat away at me anymore.  Time and perspective help.  Remind yourself that you did these things because of mental illness, it wasn't you, and whatever you did doesn't need to define you."
schizoaffective,felmhqm,t3_epfg3y,1579225715.0,I stumble over my words a lot yeah
schizophrenia,fek542c,t3_ephilm,1579192799.0,"Nah man.  We schizos get enough shit all over the place in real life.  I'm glad for kindness and empathy in at least one place.

Also some people are more high functioning than others.  You can't assume to know the experiences or circumstances or struggles of anyone else just because you share a diagnosis."
schizophrenia,fek2gig,t3_epel23,1579191192.0,"I remember being really paranoid around 11-12.  I'd be walking home from school and suddenly RUN because I thought someone was following me, or when my parents left me at home alone, I'd spend the entire time looking out the window and crying because of potential intruders.  I also heard things at 18 when I was manic (schizoaffective here), but I was diagnosed at 20 or 21 though when I had my first full and major psychotic episode."
bipolar,feg3rbc,t3_eouhpn,1579075602.0,"I dread it except for times that I'm really struggling, and even then I don't know that I would call it excited.  Maybe desperate.  I know logically that my doctor is a doctor and he doesn't judge me, but I still get embarrassed talking in detail about a lot of this."
schizophrenia,fefv1kt,t3_eox418,1579066109.0,"That sucks.  I'm sorry.  There are a lot of shitty therapists out there, especially when it comes to psychotic disorders because so few specialize in that area.  It's a shame."
schizophrenia,fefuvbd,t3_eoq08k,1579065948.0,"I've taken adderall, adderall xr, ritalin, concerta, and nuvigil (not all at once of course, but throughout the years at separate times).  The adderall ones both made me very anxious, and nuvigil didn't do anything for me.  I take concerta now and it does help a lot with cognitive issues, but not any of my other negative symptoms."
schizophrenia,fed0x4n,t3_eo2prf,1578993134.0,This made me smile real big.  I'm happy you two found each other :)
schizoaffective,fed0sds,t3_emd2pk,1578992949.0,"I used to be really smart.  Genius IQ.  Straight A's in school.  Skipped a grade.  Etc.

Now I can barely manage to read 1 paragraph or formulate a coherent sentence.

I try to remind myself that there are many forms of intelligence.  Yeah maybe I lost my book smarts, but my emotional intelligence has grown SO much throughout this disorder.  I value that more now.  I might be dumber, but I'm more mindful and empathic."
schizoaffective,fddkr35,t3_ej2j0f,1578316056.0,"Yes.  Even when I'm not fully psychotic, I always have some low grade lingering paranoia."
bipolar,fbi9wzb,t3_edgrwv,1576894953.0,I've tried all of these but I was a chaotic bitch for longest.  Accurate.  Currently none apply other than the occasional edgy bitch.
