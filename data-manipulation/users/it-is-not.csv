But I wanted to ask, you said he was bipolar right? I'm not justifying his actions in any way, but surely, it affects his behavior? I understand where you're coming from, but have you tried understanding his side? I honestly think both of you should sit down, somewhere quiet, and have a calm discussion about it. Confront him, tell him how it made you feel, ask him what he was thinking during it if this is normal for him.  It's hard to not be rash about things, but talking things out may help. If he doesn't cooperate or is just is a douche about the whole thing, then leave it. You deserve better!"

And it's great that you changed, and honestly don't beat yourself up about it. It really helps to talk it through with someone.

But I deleted my Discord account, for good. For those who are unfamiliar with Discord, it's a *free voice, video, and text chat app,* which you can use to make friends with people. It's mainly used for gaming communities. Anyways, I've had Discord for two years, maybe more, and recently, I've decided to delete it. I built so many friendships on there and witnessed the rise and fall of people or whole groups, it's truly amazing.    
I know they were just my online friends, probably just complete strangers, but deep down all of them were real people, with real lives and real problems. Now that my account is deleted, I can no longer talk to these people that I've known for so long, and it's really sad. With people you know IRL, even if you delete your social media, you can still see each other, but with online friends, that's it, you can't see them and it's scary to let go. But it was something I had to do in the interest of my mental health, so am I sad about it? Of course, but things get easier over time."
