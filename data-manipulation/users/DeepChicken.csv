In this case it is most definitely just the nictitating membrane or “second eyelid” of the tiger. The tiger seems very healthy in terms of coat, eye clarity, focus, response to stimuli (healthy sense of smell), and of course a healthy appetite! Not that any of us can be sure without proof.

In the case of a cat (I only know house cats really) that is asleep or unconscious with its eyes open, rolled backwards, or both, it could be a bad sign as you mentioned. Many times during anesthesia cats will exhibit various stages of eye movement, and it is actually used as a fairly low-tech gauge of how “deep” into anesthesia they are. If the eyes are moving around or constricting, usually indicates a lighter state. If eyes start to heavily dilate or roll backwards and/or opposite-sideways from each other, tends to indicate a deepening of the plane of anesthesia. 

Obviously, every animals different, but most cats are small and low in fat, which means too much anesthesia too quickly can very easily lower them too deep potentially killing them or causing brain damage. Fat and general body mass helps to sort of slow down and absorb the anesthetic gas chemicals in blood stream, which makes them require more gas and time, but also lowering risks of a rapid change in status or depth of plane. 

Anyway, ramble over.

TL;DR:

Not really a common sign of illness or whatever for the cat to use is “second eyelid,” very normal behavior. It **can** be if the *actual eye* is showing whites or sleeping/unconscious with eyes all the way open."
