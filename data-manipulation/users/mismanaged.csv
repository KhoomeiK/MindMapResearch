cringepics,fe5lvp6,t1_fe5hv01,1578871102.0,"So regarding your first paragraph.

Sure, if the entire story is fictional and all the assumed facts were different, then the result would be different. It's a story on the internet, who knows how much is true.

The discussion is whether or not, in a country that has GDPR, an employee using a phone number a customer has given to his employer in order to solicit a date from her is in violation of GDPR or not.

The answer to that is yes, although the company is what has to worry about the breach.

Is this **illegal**?. While an argument could be made that the employee stole customer data from his employer and that is a crime, texting her is not and the delivery guy probably wouldn't face more than a firing.

I am in fact trained specifically in the legalities of GDPR since I work for a company that handles a ton of PI.

I understand where you are coming from in the sense that the word ""illegal"" gets thrown around a lot on reddit, even when it doesn't apply. What I was trying to make clear was that what happened was/would be a possible violation of GDPR if it occurred in a country where GDPR applied and where OP's story is accurate.

Would the company get fined? If they found out and did not report it, if they deliberately allowed for systemic breaches, or simply did not do enough to secure it, then yes they would. See the fine handed out to British Airways as an example of data theft resulting in a company getting fined.

GDPR is pretty simple at its core, you basically give a company data about yourself and agree how they can use it. If that data ends up with another entity without your consent, or is used for a different purpose, that's a problem."
WarCollege,fe5i3zb,t1_fe2s4it,1578869739.0,"It's been quieter lately, but if you read about some of the decorated vets of the Falklands who were found out to have collected ears from dead Argentinians it's a short step to realise that these people we send to hellholes to get shot at might not always be the most mentally stable.

I have friends that are soldiers, and every one of them knows someone who they wouldn't trust in civilian life."
cringepics,fe5f5te,t1_fe583zu,1578868733.0,"As someone who works with PI, the other guy is right and you are wrong.

The customer gave her name, address and phone number **to the company** for the express **purpose of having a package delivered**. 

This is enough to identify her, this is PI. The purpose is clear, it is so the company can deliver stuff to her.

**The employee** has now used this information **to ask her out on a date**.

If he has moved the number to his personal phone, that is a breach, since only the company has the right to hold that data and transferring it to an outside party, in this case, the employee as a private individual, without her consent is a violation.

He used the number to solicit a date from her. That is not the purpose for which she agreed to have her data processed, another violation.

Either way, GDPR has been violated at least once.

>it's not PI, it's just a phone number 

If this was a random dialler, texting numbers without knowing anything else, that might be an argument. Here though he clearly knows who he is texting and where she lives. That is sufficient to consider this abuse of PI."
