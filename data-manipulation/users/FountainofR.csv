""Testosterone belongs to a class of male sex hormones called androgens, which can trigger acne by over-stimulating oil glands. They can also change the skin cells that line hair follicles, making them sticky and more likely to clog pores.

Here’s how it works: Tiny glands are inside the pores of your skin, and they produce an oil called “sebum.” Sebum carries dead skin cells from follicles to your skin’s surface, but when there is too much of it, follicles become clogged and pimples can emerge. Testosterone increases the production of sebum, making it a prime acne culprit."""

The total debt was above $100 million and it was accruing interest at the rate of about $30,000 per day.

The debt was non-recourse, which means that no one is liable for the debt. The only remedy is to take the property back. Supposedly, no one really wanted the property because of asbestos issues.

2. The parties agree to a bench trial rather than a jury trial.
3. here are no disputed issues of material fact.

The last one is the type most people have a problem understanding.

If everyone agrees the light was green when you drove through the intersection there is no need for a jury to decide that issue. The judge can just make the ruling as to who is liable based upon that undisputed fact.

Typically, a case has to be very straight forward to be disposed of on a motion for summary judgment. A defense based upon the statute of limitations is a good example. The date the event occurred is typically undisputed. The date the lawsuit was filed is always undisputed. The Court can take those facts and rule in the defendant's favor without a jury trial if the claim was time barred under the applicable statute of limitations."

I have seen a Lone Star Steakhouse built on the wrong out parcel.

I have seen a house built on the wrong lot. 

I have seen a realtor draw up a contract on the wrong condo unit with the mistake being discovered the day before closing when the realtor and buyer went to different units for the pre closing walk through.

I have seen a Walmart store lack street access on one side of its parking lot because it's lawyers over looked the fact that the seller kept a strip of land bordering the street.

All but the condo involved high dollar experienced professionals. If they make these kind of mistakes a lay person has no chance.

Never buy property based upon what it looks like on a visual inspection. Have a survey or at least a lender's mortgage Plat prepared. Check the dimensions and the location of any improvements.

Buy title insurance too."
insaneparents,fcyot5e,t1_fcxqxcr,1578084067.0,There's a real benefit in unraveling yourself from this family. I am an attorney. Even if someone wanted to pay me very well for such a small claims lawsuit I would tell them to walk away. This is the time to make a clean break from them and not let them try to keep bullying you under the guise of defending a lawsuit.
politics,fcvzzjj,t1_fcvqyad,1578013977.0,"Once you have been pardoned you can no longer incriminate yourself for that crime since you are immune from re-prosecution for that crime.

The Fifth Amendment allows you to remain silent so as to not implicate yourself in a crime. Once that is no longer legally possible you no longer have the right to remain silent.

It's not unusual for the government to grant low level members of a conspiracy immunity to force them to testify in order to convict the leaders in the conspiracy."

YouShouldKnow,fcu1gx5,t1_fcu0igx,1577969370.0,"I actually had someone hack my Amazon account. The first time I did not have 2FA turned on. So I set that up. A few days later it was hacked again.

No idea how they got around the 2FA.

When I first saw the text from Amazon with the code I laughed thinking I had foiled the hacker and then I saw the Amazon emails where they immediately changed the password and email address.

No idea what the motive is since they can only order and send things to me unless they have my full credit card number to deliver packages somewhere else.

With the first hack they sent me some baby toy. Then Amazon locked the account when they tried to order an expensive gaming system. They did not do anything with the second hack."

One day we had a casual day for some reason. She shows up with her hair down wearing contacts and a simple t-shirt and blue jeans.

Oh my fucking God.

She was a stone cold 10 hidden by a very simple business look."

My only regret is that i waited so long. I should have done this several years ago.

I did my initial test as kind of a lark just to rule out Low T. I had been very lethargic and foggy during the day. I really thought it was something else. I have had a huge drop in productivity since the mid 2000s.

I did not recognize it at the time but erection and orgasm quality had severely deteriorated. That became evident after a few weeks on TRT.

I have tons of energy and motivation now. Also much less anxiety since I no longer let things pile up.

Only downside is a headache and some insomnia the first day or two after the injection.

I started at 180 for the first 6 weekly injections. Bumped up to 200 a few weeks ago."
