It doesn't matter what gender is a cat, we will say it's him as long as we don't call him his name, then we would change it. But yes, I have cat, she's female, but in sentence 'our cat ate our dinner' I would use masculine verb."

wow,ff32b6b,t1_ff31427,1579531822.0,"For coding it's kinda natural to go right and down, they didn't want players to use coords so they didn't change it. 
Imaging writing numbers in txt file, you would make them increase right and down. You wouldn't even think about other way."
socialanxiety,feql23g,t1_feps0sb,1579343044.0,"Totally agree. I had a teacher who at some point wanted us to do presentation for class once a week, even if it was two minutes on some easy topic. She never criticised anyone and didn't allow anyone else to do that. Grades were just about the topic not about how confident you are. 
I think it helped me a lot. I struggle to talk to people but I have no problem with working with a script and present things, I feel alone when I'm doing that, like I'm talking to myself, even if I look in someone's face accidentally. Too bad that doesn't work in relationships, cause I still suck at them."
wow,feoohp4,t1_feno6l4,1579303067.0,Seems they really want to use bfa to test stuff. Like the flying debuffs from worms in Uldum and earlier in mechagon.

konmari,feg9bgk,t1_fee0jyu,1579083268.0,It really is true that it helps to get to know your body more. Even if it seems not too pretty at the start.

elderscrollsonline,fedjjuv,t3_eoggxe,1579013135.0,One ad guild was spamming orbs back when you could have multiple up at once. They were doing it in Cyrodill to make lags. Whole guild was banned. Don't recommend doing this.
socialanxiety,fe8bfyn,t1_fe81zty,1578924488.0,"So maybe it's better to say that I don't recommend just the watches which needs the app to change settings, cause watch itself is just fine."
socialanxiety,fe7y2f2,t1_fe7mqyk,1578920449.0,"Just wanted to say I really not recommend garmin watches, I have one and it's fine but you need their app to change anything and the app is really hard to work with. I uninstalled it once and now I can't turn off an alarm cause watch will just not connect."

wow,fducfdh,t1_fdu5mlw,1578731151.0,"No, but if they already made the allied race system for these two, why would they add the rest as the customization options?"
wow,fdtwftf,t1_fdqjnlt,1578723317.0,"If it was a customization, void elves would need to be horde and nightborne would need to be alliance and I think they wanted to give both sides a night elf and blood elf model. 
Personally, I like it that way. I think it would be too much for the UI if it was all added as a customization option."

konmari,fd7irt0,t1_fd4vdpx,1578205201.0,"I bought a cup two months ago and it's great, especially on nights which were huge problem for me earlier, I had a lot of leaks then for some reason. Needed to make some weird installment with two pads or use a tampon but you shouldn't wear them so long... But cup is ideal. Can't use it everyday, cause my second day is too much for that and I can't imagine changing it in public restroom yet but I'm getting there"

ZeroWaste,fd5sonj,t3_ek0q16,1578181062.0,"But don't you need more product on it to use it? Doesn't the tonic just sink in until you use a lot? 
That's the only downside I can think so I hope I'm wrong. They look cute tho, nice work."
minimalism,fd2fj6v,t3_ejkpm1,1578146479.0,"I don't think buying anything you don't need is particularly bad, you can buy it, check it out and donate, or sell it on ebay, or gift to a friend... isn't it worth buying for new experience?
But I'm new to minimalism so I can be wrong."

socialanxiety,fcev2r5,t3_eh1o55,1577624004.0,"It's really hard to talk with someone you don't really know so it's not weird you struggle with that. But I think something important to remember is that most people like being asked questions.  
Like they mention they have a boyfriend so you can ask 'how did you guys met' or 'how long have you guys been together'. Some simple questions, but not too personal like 'do you think it's the one?'.  
People like it when they see you're interested in them. Try to remember what they told you, even simple things like they were worried they will miss the bus and next time you can ask if they missed it or not. It can be weird at the start, but it feels nice for the other person.  


But most important thing - unless you're not being a jerk, don't be afraid to tell what you think or ask what you're really interested in. I guess people prefer weirdos over non-talkers.  
Good luck."
