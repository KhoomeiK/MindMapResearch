MaddenUltimateTeam,felyq1w,t1_felfxe5,1579234369.0,Most Packer fans are petty and delusional.
dogswithjobs,fek0zg2,t3_epbq6y,1579190280.0,What a sweet dog. You are lucky to have Raider.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fehu5m6,t1_fedjv9s,1579123926.0,"My choices were: michael thomas, luke keuchly, and tarik cohen. I chose thomas. Never put any abilities on him.

He was trash, kept dropping balls so I sold him for training.  Thomas would drop passes, open and in traffic, during solos and in online games, I was really disappointed. Regret not taking Luke."
Chargers,feeywsi,t3_cvgvvl,1579044272.0,The NFL should retire the Chargers.
toptalent,fecjso5,t3_eoa6cp,1578975631.0,Thats really nice. Question: is that handle strong enough to hold the mug or is it more ornamental?
Cubs,fecj4q8,t3_eocua6,1578975168.0,"I know it probably sucks right now, but hang in there. This will pass eventually and you will remember all the reasons you became a fan. But feel free to root on the Cubbies if it helps."

MaddenUltimateTeam,fe6t591,t3_eny1em,1578904210.0,I’ve played probably 100 hours of the game and this has never happened for me.

MaddenUltimateTeam,fe687hh,t1_fe2wf1w,1578883928.0,"EA, thank you for the relatively easy NFL 100 95 overall player I earned. Thank you also fir the 89 playoff player. It’s appreciated."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fdd7lym,t3_eko2la,1578298406.0,No thanks

MaddenUltimateTeam,fck6gw8,t1_fciuskk,1577717936.0,Who was his qb and receivers? 0 passing yards? Lmao
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc10ogi,t1_fc0p5zn,1577304904.0,"Besides, if you don’t agree with me that your team is not one of the most stories in sports, then why no love from MUT?"
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc10kpp,t1_fc0p5zn,1577304822.0,"You’re so broken, you keep responding."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc0nsgz,t1_fc0enas,1577295452.0,Packer fans are so weak mentally. Broke another one.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc0diz1,t1_fc0c4k6,1577287799.0,Just because you say “absolutely” doesn’t mean shit. I can name at least 20 teams more “stories” than the Packers. No one gives a shit about the Packers outside of Wisconsin.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc0dcoa,t1_fc0c079,1577287641.0,What a stories response.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc0c04y,t1_fc0ad7l,1577286413.0,But let’s get back to your absurd comment the Packers are one of the “most stories teams in sports”. They aren’t even one of the most “stories” teams in NFL history.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc0bnyt,t1_fc0ad7l,1577286102.0,What a stories response.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc0a7zb,t1_fc0232a,1577284715.0,Says the Packer fan who can’t spell i.e. “stories franchises in sports”. But this is a laughable statement. Typical of a Packer fan. Totally delusional and don’t say “stories franchise” dumb dumb.
