EscapefromTarkov,ffrbkle,t1_ffqsm0y,1580154649.0,Doesn’t sound very Chadly to me.  Worrying about your gear value to map ratio is a rat concern.  Chads go balls in and juiced to the gills no matter the map.
EscapefromTarkov,ffrb6p0,t1_ffq8ouh,1580154411.0,"The rat prioritizes their hoard of rubles and net work above all else.  They are careful and only initiate fights they believe they have a high chance or winning, often with ambushes and sneak attacks.  A “good” raid of Tarkov to a rat is where they find a ton of valuable loot (perhaps corpses from fights they were not in, but vultured) and escape without ever even shooting their gun.

Chads proritize kills.  They do not care about stash value.  Tarkov is a 100% PVP game to a Chad.  A good raid for a Chad is one where they are regularly engaged in high energy firefights.  Leaving the raid without shooting their gun is basically time wasted to them.


Neither of them are to be confused with Hatchlings, which are their own thing.  They are closer to a rat than a Chad though.  They simply disregard the rest of the map like autonomous robots bent entirely on rushing a single location and shoving something valuable into their gamma before dying.  Neither rats nor chads are suicidal like Hatchlings."
