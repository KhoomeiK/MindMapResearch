An associates in Psychology is not going to get you very far unless you want to do some kind of social service work.

There is no shame in being an office assistant at a bank.  It might even get you interested in fiance, accounting or marketing.  Or might make you realize that's not for you.

To me, you honestly don't sound like you would do well earning a BA degree, you'd only be earning it to please someone else, and not being doing it because you want to.

I highly suggest you look around for work, and work a few years.

If \*IF\* you want to try college again, please do so with caution.  Talk to some trade schools/community colleges in your area about short term job training programs (like 30 credit training program in accounting for example) They often cater the job training programs/short term certificates to what local employers are wanting.

Also:  The Associates in Psychology isn't totally useless.  Google what can I do with an Associates in Psychology- lots of options that don't involve sales, real estate or social services."

Also, they have stated non stem majors (meaning those who apply with a Ba in say History or English or Theater) are just as prepared for the hard work yet at the same time, much more open to professors about their limits, handle the stress better and speak up much sooner than their stem major peers at the first sign of them struggling with any of the concepts being taught."
