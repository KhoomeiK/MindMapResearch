*Some untoward office romances blossoming behind the Mystery Machine doors (Velma is secretly going out with Shaggy. Velma and Shaggy! And Fred and Daphne are engaged!), there are actual ghosts and proper monsters. Hide under the duvet at the Evil Entity, a mass of tentacles and eyeballs who is obsessed with the total destruction of the universe. Quiver behind the sofa at Charlie the Haunted Robot, who is still a haunted robot when the gang unmask him. And jump into Shaggy’s arms at a race of alien creatures called the Anunnaki, who travel to Earth every 1,000 years from another dimension and inhabit the bodies of animals.*
