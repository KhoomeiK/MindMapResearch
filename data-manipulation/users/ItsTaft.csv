For hearing aids, it's really common for babies to be given hearing aids at 6 months old , and if no improvement is made for 6 months, 3 in some cases , implanted after 12 months old if bilateral hearing is worse than 90, and after 2 if it's above 80.  Mostly to cut the risk of developmental problems . There were cases of lack of speech, hearing and even mental development due to late implantation because hearing loss wasn't detected early enough."

aww,ffzxnfj,t1_ffzx9k6,1580395524.0,"It's not about if it's offensive or not. It's about calling someone who can hear, deaf. When they go through all the process to get implanted, adapt to the implant and live with that, calling them deaf would be ignorant. Every single person who has implants I worked with love the fact that they can hear again and they aren't deaf anymore."

aww,ffzwdtj,t1_ffzsbl9,1580394622.0,Cochlear implantation process is not a simple thing. From the surgery to rehabilitation. They work really hard to regain hearing and speech understanding.  And at the very least they can hear.
aww,ffzvuz5,t1_ffzvbll,1580394246.0,"Oh that's different, I didn't know they waited that long there. Is it 5 nonetheless or do they wait for a certain group? Do they also wait for children born deaf?"
aww,ffzvmwz,t1_ffzqwfu,1580394083.0,"Don't fucking try to divide people born with deafness or hearing impairment to a different group with your tumblr bullshit. If there isn't a specific contra-indication, children implanted at a proper age can absolutely learn to speak well. There are children  speak so well you wouldn't realize that they are implanted. Spare me your bullshit separatism."
aww,ffzv29t,t1_ffzrxha,1580393657.0,"My dude you are somewhat wrong, children can be implanted as early as when they 1 year old. She could be implanted when she was 2 or maybe 7.
The time that they increase the sound level is 1 month, from first fitting to first control. Then in the span of 1 year are checked in 3rd, 6th months and 1st year. It is not necessary to increase the charge either. And they hear directly from cochlea, not skull.

 Also with proper hearing and speech rehab, 3 years is way too long to finish adapting. With implants, it is rarely a case of hearing, they start hearing the moment you turn on the implant. The real issue is to  gain the ability to understand speech and sounds with the implant. Children that age adapt incredibly fast unless there is a secondary impairment or if her implant is a rare case of an ABI.
