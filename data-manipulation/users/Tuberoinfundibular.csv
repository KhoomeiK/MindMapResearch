atheism,ff10fw3,t1_ff0ycu5,1579474031.0,">First let me note that it's kind of interesting you refer to Jesus as ""Christ"". That means messiah, so not very typical for a non-believer to say.

I used to be a Christian which is probably why I refer to Jesus as Christ despite not believing.

>But to answer your question, it's because his teachings don't make sense out of context. Why should I not respond to insults (by turning the other cheek)? Why should I love my enemies and pray for those who persecute me? It's because the kingdom of Jesus is not of this world. I have no reason to hate anyone, because my only purpose in this temporary place is to be a servant to other people, to love them so that they may know God.

I hate this mindset - what's the point of doing anything then, since as long as you believe in Christ you are saved a spot in his eternal kingdom?

Jesus' moral teachings have worth outside of the context of ""believe in me otherwise you won't go to heaven."" There's an entire form of [cultural Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_atheism) that advocates Jesus' teachings without believing him to be the son of god. Do you think that religion is necessary for morality? It seems like you do because you are saying Jesus' moral teachings have no meaning if you don't believe in him. Some of Christ's teachings are beneficial to society by advocating non-violence and compassion - you don't need to believe in god to value these teachings and you can certainty teach your kids these same teachings without the religious baggage associated with them.

>Every other worldview in the world, especially before modern times, would classify these views as ""weak"" or in Nietzsche's words ""slave mentality"". And I have to agree with Nietzsche. If God doesn't exist, then Christian teachings are nothing more than slave mentality.

 We have no reason to believe that God exists. There is no evidence or indication that God is out there. You and all Christians only have faith, which is not a valid way at all to determine truth. So it seems to me that Christian teachings are nothing more than a slave mentality."

Prepubescent kids are too young, immature, and naive to question what their parents tell them.

I do find some of Christ's teachings offensive, but I admire some of his teachings as well. I think he was far from a perfect individual and by no means a divine being.

Again, I ask: why do you think that you have to teach the ""divinity"" of Christ in order to spread the good things that he espoused?"
