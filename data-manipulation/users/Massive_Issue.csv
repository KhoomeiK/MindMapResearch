There's a lot left out of this story. Sometimes things can come out of nowhere, but teachers usually get a lot of warning before a situation gets so escalated that it erupts into violence. 

I work in a behavior program as a para (I also have my teaching license) and the only kids that escalate to physical violence with literally NO WARNING is my RADs kindergartner and one particular autistic student. Even in students that have behavior problems, disabilities, or special needs...you usually get clear warning signs that the child is agitated and that someone needs to step in."

news,fewbpsv,t1_fevdw7p,1579408049.0,"I'm assuming she is accessing the tape to press charges against the kids and their families. 

The bus driver wasn't even written up. Kids put a 5 year old in a chokehold. She screamed for help. He failed to act. And no discipline at all? That's bananas. 

We had a para tell a special ed kid to hit a bully and she was at least written up for it. And that was without any actual assault. I'm appalled that anyone working with kids could ignore someone asking for help under their care. There is a curmudgeonly old bitch working as a para at our school who routinely ignores and over disciplines kids. I hate her. Why are you working with kids if you have so little care or compassion? 

I think the outrage here is that the parent of a 5 year old can't easily access the footage of their own child's assault. I strongly feel the privacy of the other kids involved should be protected regardless of their guilt, but the powerlessness parents have to advocate for their child and access basic knowledge about such a horrifying incident is concerning."

news,fev9p2d,t1_feu1q83,1579394822.0,"In some cases, no. 

My son was involved in a bullying incident. He had been bullied for two years by the same kid. One day they had a verbal exchange and my son walked up to him and hit the kids lunch out of his hands. 

The mom demanded to see the video without me even being notified there had been an incident, and freaked out on me, my child, and their teacher at school. 

Whatever shitty thing my kid does, I don't think he needs to be publicly screamed at by a person he doesn't fucking know. He has the right to an organized process dispensing justice and the discipline can be carried out without the family knowing all the details. 

Guess what? Gossip, shit talking, and rumors spread throughout the mom population at the school. My son wasn't invited to birthday parties anymore. He got bullied even more at school. 

Obviously these kids in this particular situation are grossly in the wrong but these are CHILDREN and they have a right to privacy so long as the district handles the situation. 

Obviously the district did NOT handle the situation and therefore we are going into different territory so in this case she had the right to know their identities and pursue a legal case. 

Once I showed up at the school with two years worth of emails documenting the bullying, reminding them of the many meetings we have had to address this very issue, a letter from his child psychologist that we had been paying for to try and help out son with positive peer interaction and conflict resolution since no one at the school would help him, the school was generally supportive of us and knew that our son was verbally provoked and that his actions were the result of this kid constantly picking on him, but the damage was done."

Music,fetsmxq,t1_fa812gu,1579379588.0,"Literally every artist cleans up their vocals. Her live vocals are decent, she's had some notably bad live performances and that's a fair thing to say. She isn't a belter like Mariah but you don't have to have one specific type of vocal style to be ""good"". Again, it's completely fair to say you don't care for her style or her music in general.

Music,fets4z9,t1_fanhxjw,1579379371.0,"Lol she literally just won a bunch of artist of the decade awards. If she's not charting in ten years it will be because she isn't making music for the radio anymore. Many people still listen to her early albums. 

Some of her songs have not aged well and will remain a product of their era. That can be said for almost any artist. 

Otherwise, she's got a solid catalogue that is still listened to and beloved by millions of people 13 years on. 

If you don't like her music, that's cool. I don't like a lot of pop artists music. Not my thing. It's fine. 

She's still popular over a decade later because, while you may not care for her sound and resent the massive commercial appeal of her brand, she sings about things lots of people relate to and that are universally relatable. Many artists have decades worth of songs about heartbreak and love, she's not uniquely unoriginal in that aspect. 

I think her albums after Speak Now are probably more mature and have more depth and may age better."

todayilearned,fepg487,t1_feoza27,1579319637.0,"Rehabilitation should always be the goal. Reddit gets a justice boner about locking people up and throwing away the key, when that should never be the goal. 

Some people must be kept away from society because they are a danger to others--crazed serial killers with psychopathic minds that are unable to discern right from wrong or simply don't feel empathy, for example. That doesn't mean these people should simply rot in a cell. They should be getting mental health treatment and rehabilitative activity. 

One post of a drunk woman's smiling mugshot after she crashed her car and killed several reminds me of this point. Yes her crime was awful and her selfish destructive choices led her to take innocent peoples lives, but when the taxpayers are footing the bill for people like this, doesn't it make sense to try and make this person's time in prison productive? Once she sobered up don't you think that 99% of people would be absolutely destroyed knowing their horrible decision caused people to be killed? Wouldn't it be better to get this woman addiction treatment, counseling, and make sure that her time paying her debt to society is worth some of the hundreds of thousands it costs to keep her there? What justice is done by simply destroying yet another person's life? Innocent people already died, why do we want to destroy another one? 

Our justice system is fucked and even ultra liberal Reddit celebrates this twisted mentality that people should suffer and be punished in prison because they did something bad, and the thought ends there. As if causing someone suffering is in and of itself worthwhile to society. For most cases i disagree."

I've also done the same for friends and family over the years. I contact friends and relatives to get current numbers and email addresses. 

Alternatively you can make a sock profile that you use simply to have messenger. I did this when I moved to a new area. I joined several Facebook groups for locals on this anonymous profile and messaged some people on there. After a few months I had settled in and no longer needed that, either. 

I have an Instagram that I post on sporadically and am much more discerning about my follows and followers there. I have about 30 people, all family and close friends, that I follow so I can see pics of their kids and know about their lives. I don't follow people that post dumb pictures of their food or gym selfies. I'm over it and past that point in my life. No memes and no drama, I love it. 

It's forced me to actually start mailing people through the post. As I get older I'm realizing the value in investing in relationships and it's been personally very satisfying to me. I want to make sure my friends and family know I care and appreciate them, and I want them to feel we have a real connection and share real things, not just life updates through Facebook every 6 months where they don't want to admit their marriage is struggling or their kid is having a hard year in school. 

Deleting my 11 year old Facebook was liberating. It was like a fresh start. I also hesitated saying goodbye to many old business associates and colleagues and lamented if I'd ever need a reference or a favor someday. I wondered if I would miss my friends.

relationships,fds7jqo,t1_fds5c9r,1578696133.0,"You can do this. Choose a practical time, but don't keep making excuses to put it off indefinitely. There will never be a perfect time. 

You know where you are staying, great. Can your cat go there? Do u know what you are going to say for the conversation? What if he tries to defend himself, interject, or negotiate with you? Have you thought about how to respond? What about after the conversation? Will you leave and stay with a friend or whatever? Will you bring your cat right then? 

It makes sense for you to take the older cat and him to take the kitten. 

If he tries to negotiate, ask questions, get you to defend yourself, shut that shit down. This is not a discussion or negotiation. It's not a debate. You aren't going to accomplish a breakup by getting him to agree with you or see your side. He's not going to ""let you go""....you need to be determined that you are going to do this and you do not need his consent or his Blessing. 

If he tries to cajole you into discussing things, be prepared. You aren't here to work things out. 

""But don't you love me?"" Is a way for him to try and get you to say you love him. Of course you still love him in a way, but he's trying to side track you. 

""I know this is painful for you, but I've made up my mind. I don't want to discuss it. I am ending this relationship because it's what I want for myself. I think it's best that i give you  some space to process, so I'm going to head out now. I'll text you and let you know when I'll be back for my things."" 

Go in with a script, get through it quickly, and end the conversation AND LEAVE. Do not engage in attempts to discuss and negotiate. You don't owe him any justification or explanation. Say what you need to say and be done with it. This is so so so so soooo important. 

How do you want to say it? When is the best time? There is no best time but you should have an idea in mind so the day doesn't pass you by. 

""Boyfriend, I need to tell you something. There's no easy way for me to say this, but my heart is not in this relationship anymore and it's time for me to move on. I know this is difficult for you to hear and may be a bit of a surprise, so I understand you may need some time to process. I've already made arrangements about where I'm going to live and how to get my things. I don't want to work things out. Ending the relationship is what I want. I understand you need some time to digest, so I'll be heading out now. We have a lot of arrangements to make regarding my stuff, and I'll contact you about that this weekend "" 

I know it sounds cold, but this is the best way to do it. Don't say you're sorry, don't justify WHY you want to do this. You're doing it and that's all that matters. He doesn't need to know why. You don't want to be together anymore and you don't need to provide any other reasons, girl. None. ""I don't want to"" is good enough. You don't need a reason to break up. You don't owe him sworn testimony to accomplish a breakup. Inform him of your decision, and leave. 

He will likely write you messages on text. Ask you questions. Express his undying love. DO NOT ADDRESS THEM. For the love of God. You don't owe him any explanations and you don't need to justify yourself. And you certainly don't need to comfort him! 

If you get texts just have a generic reply: ""I know this is hard for you and that's understandable. I've made the decision to move on. If you need someone to talk to about processing your emotions, I suggest reaching out to a friend."" Or don't even respond at all. 

You will feel guilty. You will feel sad. You will doubt yourself. Do not let him string you back in by getting you into a debate. Your feelings are normal and we all experience this in breakups. It doesn't mean your decision is wrong. Remind yourself why you are doing this, crystallize it into a mantra, and say it out loud to yourself and in your head to stay focused. 

You can do this!!!!"
relationships,fds17pp,t3_emx4cb,1578692736.0,"You were 17 and he was 21, you're now an adult woman. It's understandable how you feel. I was in a very similar situation. 

I also struggled with the same things you are: I was very (VERY VERY) close with his entire family--nieces, uncles, siblings, parents--and most of my friends were part of his social circle. It felt overwhelming and huge to take such a big step. I'd spent so many years with this person--what would I do when I had a bad day? Who would I call? The thought of dating again seemed daunting--I have a nice, loving partner now so why change it? 

Girl, just rip the bandaid off and do it. There's no easy way to do it where he won't have his feelings hurt. But honestly, a lot of my fears about losing friends, losing his family, etc were wayyyyy overblown in my mind. 

I have never felt so free and so hopeful about my future as the day I ended it. A huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. 

Yes, I did have the knee jerk reaction to text or call when I wanted to talk about something, had a bad day, etc. I had been relying on this relationship as an emotional crutch for years. Even though it was weird and uncomfortable for a while, I recognized what was happening and felt grateful for the growth opportunity--YUP you will have to go outside your comfort zone. YUP you will have to learn how to self soothe when you want to talk something out and have no one to call. YUP you will have to deal with those feelings of 'I want to cuddle and watch Netflix after a long day' and you come home to an empty house. But I would never trade it for the world. I WAS FREE!

As much as I thought everyone would be scandalized and hurt about our breakup, it blew over really quickly. And then I realized how little the relationships I had with people actually mattered to me AND then. Sure, we were friends and some of us had been through some stuff together. But really, were we THAT close? No. I missed members of his family and felt bad about things, but guess what. Their lives will move on in an instant and you will realize that it's actually completely okay and completely normal to form new relationships and say goodbye to old ones. Everyone will be fine. 

I got some weird reactions from a few friends in the immediate aftermath which made me feel bad for a minute, but honestly fuck those people. I went for a complete and full clean break and I guess that ruffled some peoples delicate sensitivities. They aren't living your life and you have to do what's best for you. 

But girl, if you're gonna do it you need to commit to it fully. If you leave one foot in the door you guys will be waffling back and forth on this, emotionally entangled, forever. It will halt your growth as a person and be so dysfunctional. I've watched it happen so many times. 

Make the break when you have a plan in place about where you're going to live, how you're going to get your stuff, etc. IF you haven't figured that out yet, don't break up. You need a plan so that when you end the conversation and walk out the door your loose ends are tied up and you can't be guilted or manipulated into staying. I was very worried that I wouldn't have the resolve to stay gone so I made arrangements ahead of time. 

Get your stuff out, go immediately to a friend or family members house, and BLOCK/DELETE FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. I'm not saying you have to block his phone number, but you need to remove yourself from his social media. Wanna know what I did? I actually unfriended all of our casual acquaintances in one fell swoop right before I broke up with him. There were a lot of people I was connected to that didn't really talk to that much or see very often, so I just did some housekeeping. I wanted my mental space to be free and clear. I didn't want to be connected to a bunch of people in his circle. 

Of course, I kept mutual friends that I actually talked to and had relationships with. But truth be told, in time those fell away. And that's okay! I  made new friends and lived life on my own as my own woman. It was glorious.

You don't have kids or a mortgage together and you're young. You don't need to go to therapy to try and save this relationship. You're not feeling it anymore, girl, and that's okay. Make a choice to invest in YOURSELF and YOUR future, and do what needs to be done. Spread those wings!"
relationships,fdryu2c,t1_fdrunf7,1578691812.0,"I have friends who were given agency by the court at a certain age to choose whether or not they wanted to spend time with a certain parent when we were teens--ie they could refuse visitation. Unfortunately the 11 year old may be too young to choose though. It's still worth talking to the court about in my opinion. My friends were forced to see the other parent for a while before the court allowed them to make the choice themselves. They were much happier when they could have a relationship with their parent on THEIR terms and not the courts. 

Again we don't know what the agreement is here or anything, but it's definitely something that should be documented so the kids can have an easier time to refuse visitation when they get old enough."
relationships,fdrwv93,t3_emvim2,1578690882.0,"These are questions you should be asking your boyfriend, not us. These are very valid and practical concerns and any serious relationship he will have will need to to address this, especially as he gets older and more settled into his adult life. These things may seem like hypotheticals right now, but in a few short years--or even tomorrow if he gets in a car wreck--they will become central to his life as an adult. 

I'm not dragging your bf here. Obviously it is very painful and complicated to lose your family and it is understandable that he is trying to keep everyone he knows and loves in his life using any means necessary. He will likely need to come to the conclusion in time, that this current arrangement isn't sustainable or appropriate for his mental health. 

He will eventually realize that he cannot live two separate lives and will need to come to terms with how he is going to navigate his private life and the one he has with his family. I understand that dealing with losing them is a very painful prospect and he may avoid thinking about or dealing with the issue. 

I think you also need to ask yourself about your own boundaries. You seem very willing to support your boyfriend emotionally through some of this stuff, but at what point do you personally feel you need to draw a line for your own well-being? Can YOU deal with being a dirty secret in the life of the most important person to you? Can YOU deal with being verbally abused by his family if you show up at the hospital when he's had a car accident? Can YOU deal with being confronted and verbally abused by his family if things get ugly between them? Can you deal with your boyfriend not standing up for you? Can you deal with being with a partner who doesn't advocate for themselves? 

Again I'm not saying any of these things will happen, but they CAN and they DO to a lot of people. Family issues can get messy. It's important that you make your needs and boundaries clear and known from the get-go. It's important to think about how you might react or which actions you might take if you get caught in the crossfire of family drama. Or if this arrangement somehow starts to infringe on YOUR happiness and well-being, too. 

I think a sensible place to start is just by having the conversation, and seeing what he says initially. Asking those questions, keeping these things in the open rather than swept under the rug. No conclusions need to be made right now. He doesn't need to decide at this moment. He doesn't need to take any major actions tomorrow. But he does need to start confronting the reality and processing all of this in the context of a real adult life. It will take you both time to digest everything. It will take you both time to really decide how you feel about certain things. That's okay. I think you just need to start bringing it up now though."

relationships,fdrueng,t3_emvf4m,1578689889.0,"This thread is so messed up.

I have been in this situation with a male partner and it fucked me up for years. What you did was incredibly fucked up and wrong. Not because it's cringey, but because it was actively harmful and morally wrong. The fact that you were drunk actually makes it even worse in my opinion. The same male partner would get weird when he was drunk and to this day I get anxiety when my husband gets drunk because these experiences have forever impeded on my ability to feel safe around a drunk partner.

You used emotional abuse as a means of coercion to pressure someone into sex who clearly did not want to continue. Legally speaking I'm not sure that counts as rape but I'm quite sure that if he wanted to hire a lawyer about it, he absolutely could have his day in court.

Morally speaking, the whole incident is reprehensible. If you were a man telling this story you would be eviscerated in this comments section.

If I had a male partner get nasty, incessant, and emotional when I didn't want to have sex AND THEN REFUSE TO LEAVE MY HOUSE I would have felt unsafe. This is the kind of stuff I experienced over a longer period of time with an abusive partner, and yes, your behavior is straight up emotional abuse.

I didn't date that guy for long, but I was in therapy for like 3 years to get over the complete headfuck associated with being pressured into non consensual sexual contact. This guy is a saint for forgiving you and even acting understanding about it...but then again, isn't minimizing and attempting to reconcile with your abuser a really common coping mechanism among victims of abuse and rape?

Feeling really bad about it, saying sorry, and ""learning your lesson"" is not excusable and I'm appalled at this comments section who seems to think that a ""whoops"" is good enough for this absolutely egregious behavior. Do you think a judge would care if a male was like 'yeah that was so cringey I feel really bad about it'. Like no. 

Lots of people have emotional problems without feeling the need to invade someone's home, coerce them into unwanted sexual contact, and then going to their victim for comfort to absolve their guilty conscience. You don't get a free pass for this."

todayilearned,fdri37g,t1_fdr272e,1578684807.0,"Kevin Smith tells the story like this: 

The paramedics determined he was having a massive heart attack on scene, but kept their cool. To keep him and everyone else calm, they made light-hearted conversation to persuade him to get in the ambulance and go to the hospital which he initially refused. 

""Have you ever been in an ambulance before?! It's so cool man, come on let's get you checked out!"" I don't think the paramedics had the expertise to diagnose which type of heart attack he was having although I could be wrong. He was stable, lucid, and doing well so I think they acted on the knowledge they had with the determination to get him to the hospital calmly. At no point did they administer treatment which would require them to give a diagnosis other than they were concerned about his heart.

In his own words he says his doctors credited his calm demeanor towards his recovery and outcome. 

At the hospital the doctor told him he was suffering from a massive heart attack. 

Paramedics are different than doctors and no one involved in the situation who has spoken publicly has implied that they acted improperly by keeping him calm on the way to the hospital prior to giving treatments. 

I also had a medical incident and those around me were clearly working to prepare for the worst (didn't realize at the time) but gave me enough info to gain my consent but didn't go into all the details they were preparing for so I didn't lose more blood by panicking. Yes those around me were working to prep everything  to prepare for me bleeding out but I had no idea that wasn't normal because I'm not used to being in the hospital. I was very close to a serious emergency but that wasn't communicated to me in those words. They said they like to keep everything prepped, it's all good, focused my attention on the immediate stuff at hand, all the while everyone in the room was waiting for shit to hit the fan because I was showing signs of things going bad fast. They obtained my consent for a blood transfusion way earlier in the process and it seemed business as usual.
