Also, when I was little baptist boy in Alabama, it wasn’t hard to imagine that queer people were all violent rapists, but as an adult that lives in the city and has gone to multiple gay bars without any violent incident even though I’m straight, it’s just insane. It’d be like if he wrote Uneasy Rider 2020 and it involved him chasing a bunch of border crossers back into Mexico and running over some protestors with his Chevrolet. Or driving through Baltimore and his refusal to buy crack starts a race war that he has punch his way out of. I’m not trying to say none of those couldn’t be funny, but it’s hard for me to see it as anything other than a contrived revenge narrative whereas the OG Uneasy Rider had a bit of nuance considering he was also a country boy, just with long hair.

todayilearned,ffups28,t1_ffukn2y,1580246976.0,"If anyone doesn't understand the enigma of Charlie Daniels, his two different versions of his song ""Uneasy Rider"" sum it up perfectly.

First \[Uneasy Rider\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=952h-AJ3Bcg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=952h-AJ3Bcg)) has Daniels driving out to LA, but has to stop in this honky tonk in Mississippi to wait on a tow truck because he caught a flat tire. While waiting in the honky tonk, he has his long hair kept under his cap so as not to arise suspicion of the local rednecks. So these real country-looking motherfuckers walk in and Daniels decides he's uncomfortable because they might find out he has long hair and they will beat his ass for being a ""hippie."" But before Daniels can leave, one of the country-looking motherfuckers demands Daniels tip his hat to the woman in their group and of course when he does, his hair falls out and the country motherfuckers react. Thinking quickly, Daniels spins this story about how the main country-looking motherfucker is actually communist spy. This somehow works and distracts them long enough for Daniels to flee the bar and decide that he was going to take the rest of the trip ""via Omaha"" instead of continuing to drive through the south.

And then we have \[Uneasy Rider '88\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWzTU7VAPLY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWzTU7VAPLY)). Once again, Daniels is on a trip in a Chevrolet, this time with a buddy. They stop in some Texas town close Houston to eat and they go to the cloud 9 bar and grill. They slowly discover (much slower than they should've) that they are in a gay bar. His friend discovers that he was just dancing and making out with a transwoman (though he's presented more like a guy in drag, I don't expect Daniels to get the difference). His friend vomits when he learns this and then punches the transwoman in the face. This is after a man came onto Daniels and he ""unloaded on him and he went out like a light"" and so the whole bar start to converge upon them. Daniels and his friend bloodily fight their way out, mostly involving pulling people's wigs off. The song ends with the line ""going back where the women are women and the men are men.""

So in the first one, he was fighting against intolerant rednecks. In the second one, he's the intolerant redneck. It would almost be funny in context if he was trying to make a statement between the two songs, but he writes and performs it with no irony: they are both as straightforward as the other."

badhistory,ffuk7xa,t3_evamjx,1580243702.0,"I could imagine during the Golden Age, non-Muslims were less of a threat to Muslim power. In that way, outsiders weren't going to topple them and could even be benefited from through trading. That makes people in power say things like ""well see, the Quran is being metaphorical here"" instead of desiring to interpret those passages you listed above as literal. 

However, move up a few centuries and Non-Muslims are now a threat, not only to the Muslim way of life, but also to their resources and wealth. Then those verses became much more practical to interpret literally, otherwise the non-Muslims will swallow you up economically and culturally. Or maybe you, as a leader of your Muslim country, would prefer to work with the westerners, but the westerners are not popular with your people and some preacher preaching hate of non-Muslims and being right by the Quran is going to start becoming popular with the people. That same preacher might not be popular in another time period, even though it's the same message. The book hasn't changed, but the economic, political and social situations of the people following the book have and their perspectives of certain parts of the book and their faith shift when they collide with political and economic reality.

Another way to look at it is that there have been Muslims since the very beginning that wanted death to all non-Muslims. Their point of view is pandered to when it is convenient for unity among their population, but it is considered passe when it is not convenient to do so. 

Though, I do have to include a slight whataboutism in order to make my point (however, since we are talking about an Abrahamic religion, it's relevant): Leviticus says it is a sin to weave two fibers together in the same garment. It also says it's a sin for a man to be with a man. Ask yourself, why is gay marriage such a big issue with religious voters in the US (hell, most of world only made it legal within the last two decades) but the continued use and production of polyester is not? The answer is because it was much more convenient to rail against what some considered a social ill (homosexuality) than an economic boon (polyester blends are cheaper than 100% cotton). They both have Biblical basis for prohibition, but one is a better rallying point than the other. There is lot of inconvenience in the Quran like that too, but when your country isn't doing well and the westerners are pressuring you to do something, it's easy to fall back on the ""fuck outsiders"" mantra and, as you know, there is Quranic evidence of this ""fuck all non-Muslims"" attitude and so those people go with what generates the most response.

Hopefully someone will reply with a more historical learning and get into the details of when certain interpretations became more popular than the others, but as someone who grew up religious and tries to read all Holy Books, I feel you need to understand that just because it's in the Holy Book doesn't mean they actually have to follow it."

It was an unbelievable season, but I think this thread is discussing teams more like a South Carolina or a Minnesota: teams that may have had a great season or two within the last decade or so, but are usually middle-of-the-pack teams in their conference.

He just never popped and was seldom consistently reliable in clutch situations, though often above average. 

I would like Nix to turn out like Jason Campbell, who also started as a freshman, though ideally I’d like him to be able to get good before his senior season. Campbell had a great senior season, but the three previous were up and down and we can’t act like he didn’t have a good running game to help during that time.

CFB,ffu0rjp,t1_fftk73p,1580232009.0,"The state of Florida doesn’t really have the football history you’d think it’d have. It was underpopulated, humid and swampy until The state had a huge boom post WWII and went from 2 million total pop in the whole state in the 40s to its current pop level of over 20 million. It’s still swampy and humid and flat, but now it’s not underpopulated and it’s football programs have benefitted. 

FSU became a girls school in the early 1900s after it had played a few seasons of football. It didn’t become coed and get another football team until after WWII. They had some solid success in the 50s and 60s, being ranked In the top 10 sometimes and going to 3 straight bowl games at one point, a first for the state of Florida. The twilight of the 60s and first half of the 70s weren’t as good, but then Bowden came in 76 and built them into the FSU of today, culminating in 2 championships in the 90s and several runner-ups. FSU didn’t even have a conference until 1991.

UF has been playing longer and almost had a really good season in 1928 and a bowl before that, but seem to have been cellardwellers from the 30s until the 50s. 60s has some highlights, 70s were down, they had some great seasons in the 80s, but then Spurrier and the 90s finally got them the title.

Miami actually has the best pre-war history of them all and was kicking ass right into the 50s when they ran into a bowl ban that may have kept them from championships. Some solid seasons over he next 25 years, but also some really down seasons. They hired Lou Saban in the mid 70s and his recruiting started to turn them around, but he resigned before they could become “The U” because of an incident of anti-Semitic violence from his players. Schnellenberger took Saban’s recruits and started that run of sick 80s Miami teams (first title in 83 when they stole the championship from Auburn) that would eventually be continued by Jimmie Johnson and Dennis Erickson.

Tl;dr nobody lived in or wanted to live in Florida until after WWII, so it wasn’t exactly the hotbed of recruiting it is now and as a result, the state of Florida’s football success is mostly contained to the last 40 years with some good runs every now and then. Many schools in the south (and probably the rest of the country; I just know more about the south) owe their success to the GI bill after WWII. 

especially Auburn since the Alabama legislature was actively trying to deny it funding and absorb it into the UofA because Auburn was helped along originally by the radical republicans after the Civil War. Alabama did this right up until the GI Bill flooded Auburn with students and made that strategy untenable; that’s why the Iron Bowl took a break in the 20s and 30s and didn’t come back til 48: the University of Alabama wanted to absorb Auburn and therefore did not want to legitimize them by playing them. There’s some bullshit about the reason being logistics and other excuses, but the political machinations of the time make it clear Alabama (and by extension, the Alabama state legislature) wanted Auburn dead so they could get their funding and give one last fuck you to those Yankees. I’m really surprised Auburn fans don’t mention this more. I suppose they don’t know or they just didn’t want to be seen as the “yankee-made” school if they did know."

pics,fei2ali,t1_fehw1cw,1579128716.0,"The book of Matthew has a line about the “saints” of old rising from their tombs and appearing to many upon Christ’s crucifixion/resurrection. However, it’s not necessarily zombies; it’s a specific wording to make it line up with something the prophet Isaiah had prophecized in the Old Testament about the restoration of the Kingdom of Israel. Isaiah talks about God coming and restoring the United Kingdom of Israel (I believe at this time Israel had turned away from God and the kingdom of Judah was the all that was left following God) and the righteous dead will rise from Sheol (Jewish underworld where both wicked and righteous alike went when they died) and so when Matthew uses this language about the dead rising from their tombs, the implication is that Christ is the fulfillment of the Jewish messianic prophecies of the Old Testament. It’s like when a  phrase that a character used in the beginning of the movie comes back in the third act and it makes you go “oh, that’s what that meant.” He’s fulfilling the foreshadowing.

So I’d say it’s up for interpretation, but I was raised in a Baptist church and was told to interpret that as the righteous people of old finally being saved by Christ’s sacrifice and ascending to heaven. However the importance of the line is much more about Christ being the prince who was promised in the Old Testament rather than definitively saying all the righteous dead went to heaven."

I listed some devastating comments that would derail any serious American presidential candidate if they had to answer questions about them. Can you imagine Biden having to defend his son for the same shit Trump said/did? Or having to disown him? I don’t think he’d do that, but it’d be a hell of spectacle either way. Hell I want the Senate to subpoena him and I wish he’d be down for it. I’d also like to see Trump, the subject of all this impeachment mess, to be called or at least made to submit answers to questions, but that’s never going to happen either. You say I’m deflecting and arguing in bad faith, but this entire process is deflection. If the Trump administration had any proof of corruption, they’d tip their hand. The Biden corruption angle is deflection from trying to use executive power smear a rival candidate. 

It’s hard to think that the trump administration actually cares about corruption or they would’ve gotten a Clinton or an Obama by now. Or, just brainstorming, actually opened an investigation through the proper channels into the Bidens’ dealings in Ukraine. There’s nothing juicy there except gossip or they would’ve gotten him on something already, just like Clinton and, if it makes your sensibilities feel better, Trump has suffered from similar mudslinging with exaggerated accusations coming from basically biased inferences from people assuming the worst. That’s how it is for public figures.

However, what I do know is that if you’re creative (which many that work in the media are), you can make anyone look bad if you invade their privacy enough. I bet I could spin a hell of a narrative about you if I had access to a few years of emails and text messages and webcam footage and you could probably do the same to me (I am very boring though, so you’d have to be pretty creative). But I don’t like to cheer illegally invading people’s privacy without a good reason, even if they’re public figures. If they do it to the rich, they’ll have even less of a problem doing it to us. I’m tired of celebrating foreign vigilantes for invading people’s privacy.

We do have that ability though, especially since we occupied the country right next to them within the last decade and have invaded a country right next to them twice within the past two decades.

television,fdk92b1,t1_fdk7zts,1578498843.0,"My personal theory is that what initially took the Simpsons to another level was eventually it’s downfall and I’d like to blame it on Conan O’Brien because why not? When he joined around season 3, the show was still very much a sitcom that happened to be animated. Conan injected a goofiness and absurdism that hadn’t been there before. If you watch Marge V Monorail, one of Conan’s scripts, it sticks out from the other episodes around it. The words and phrases people use combined with some the jokes are much less grounded than the episodes around it. And yet, this is a top 10 Simpsons episode. 

My theory is that the Simpsons gets truly great when it expanded past the idea that it was merely an animated sitcom and started to embrace the idea that it was a cartoon. It was using the emotional beats and situational humor of a sitcom, but Conan helped infuse that with the absurdism and goofiness and an even more elastic reality of other cartoons. Problem is that when all the original sitcom writers left, they were left with a bunch of goofy cartoon and sketch writers. 

Tl;dr In the first few seasons, they leaned heavy on the sitcom part and as a result the show was good, but still fairly predictable and not great. After 8 or 9 seasons, they leaned too heavy on the goofiness and absurdism and all the characters stopped being as cherished or taken as seriously. But for a brief shining time from about season 3-8~9, they had a balance of the two and it was transcendental."

The safe space college argument will never do anything for me in a country like America. I went to college and graduated within the last 10 years and none of this went on. In fact, anti-abortion protests were the most notable political intrusion (big posters of fetus parts on the concourse part of the year, 3000 white crosses on the lawn the other; oh and a frat celebrating Robert E Lee’s birthday with a big banner on MLK day). But normal public colleges don’t count; apparently in many minds in America the east and west coast legacy schools are the only ones that exist and it’s essential they have to go there. If you want to avoid “safe spaces” and “challenge yourself” go to Auburn, or UGA or LSU. Hell, even Vanderbilt. Why are they never a part of this conversation? Because all the people complaining about safe spaces are full of shit. They just want to feel special and their rich asses wouldn’t at a southern or midwestern school’s campus. More elitism disguised as victimhood as far as I can tell. Sorry, back to the regularly scheduled conversation.

And like I said in my first comment, it’s not about what makes Reddit “better,” it’s about what keeps the lights on. Reddit will die or just become all porn unless it’s able to expand its user base. I liked the site more when it was smaller and more quirky, but I only started being on it in 2011 and there were people even then talking about how the site was going down hill and how it used to be so much better. They might’ve just been mad about them deleting all the jailbait subs, but the point is people have always thought this site was going downhill. 

And you’re right that there are probably a sizable amount of ESL users that like being corrected so they can improve their language skills. But is it all of them? How many decide not to post because they don’t want to take the time to ensure they spelled things right? Reddit doesn’t want people hesitating when they have a desire to post or comment. 1000 mediocre posts isn’t as good as a quality post, until you think about the fact that 1000 eyes on your site participating is much better and more profitable than 1 user, even if that user is great. And though I almost make it sound like a conspiracy from the higher ups, it’s much simpler than that. The more people on the site, the more mainstream the views and thoughts expressed will be. Most folks in real life hate grammar nazis, so grammar nazis aren’t allowed to thrive like we used to be. Most folks in real life don’t like all the indie or weird movies I like; they like John Wick and Marvel and so conversations on r/movies end up being anti-critic circle jerks. This site skews young and so r/politics is even more of a circle jerk than it’s always been. You gotta prove to them you aren’t a troll before they’ll even take any questioning of the articles narrative seriously. It’s the same with the conservative subs: more rabble and babble and less nuance and questioning. They picked their side and now they’re cheerleaders instead of savvy consumers like they should be (or how I prefer politics discussions to go, I should say).

Apparently, St Augustine liked the Dec 25 date because it was the winter solstice and he liked the symbolism of the days getting longer after Jesus is born. Early Middle Ages Christians were more likely to celebrate “Epiphany” which celebrated the visit by the Magi instead of Christ’s birth (I think this might be why when the story is told in the modern day, the Magi are shown arriving at Christ’s birth, instead of years later like in the Bible). I even found a source who claimed the Christians might have celebrated Christmas before Aurelian mandated the feast of the unconquered Sun (Sol Invictus) on December 25th in the 3rd century. The first documented Christmas on Dec 25 was in Rome in 336. Considering that Christmas wasn’t necessarily the standard winter Christian holiday until after Charlemagne (there were several festivals that served the same purpose, but they were not Christmas and often took place before or after) makes me think that once Christmas got popular it eventually just swallowed every other European winter festival (including Saturnalia and Sol Invictus) until Christmas became endgame."

Though, as we all know, what religious ideology says and what the adherents actually believe don’t necessarily always line up. Polls routinely show that Catholics in the US and specifically NE break with the Vatican (or hold mixed views) on many social issues like abortion and contraception (which is hilarious because abortion used to be strictly a catholic issue, as in Protestants even approved of it or delegated it, until after the civil rights movement; in addition, pro choice politicians being denied Catholic communion is a unique American phenomenon).

Some people probably are just offended that you made a joke about a feminist, no doubt about that, but others also see you using a cliché joke and adding the feminist reference for no real reason and then we’re left to surmise what the reason is. The only other reason to add the opening of your joke is if you weren't confident people will understand it, which of course neuters the joke, but sometimes is necessary. In this case I don’t believe it was. 

I wouldn’t ever downvote for a joke like that. It might not be great (especially in text form; spoken I think it works better), but a mediocre joke is nothing to get upset about. Your edit, however, is pussy shit that you should be ashamed of and you need to have a thicker skin if you want to be cracking jokes. If you talk shit, you get hit; don’t be a bitch about it. Learn from it, move on, make a better joke next time. Otherwise you’re just contributing to the outrage culture, no matter how much you squeal against it, you become a part of it."

It used to be $3.99 for anything before 4pm. Still a good price though."
