personalfinance,fffnt4g,t1_fffi28v,1579887946.0,"I hear ya.  It takes a bit of repetition.  What helped me a lot was watching shows like Chopped and Beat Bobby Flay, because they simultaneously showed me unique dishes and how to use more common things.  The up front cost, as you said, is higher, but once you buy all those dried spices they last a really long time so you don't have to buy them again (except onion powder which I feel like I need every two weeks lol).  For the buttercream and other perishables, have you tried freezing?  Most of that stuff you can freeze what you don't need for a while instead of forcing yourself to use it.  Make sure you have good freezer bags or other airtight containers and you're in good shape."

And while this does give you some way to relate, you must also understand that depression affects people differently.  I'm glad it started to click for you, but for other people it just doesn't.  I guess I'm just asking for you to be a little more understanding of how complicated depression can be, especially since you've been through some of it yourself."

personalfinance,ffffnpa,t1_fff926a,1579882930.0,they could be buying organic everything and more expensive cuts of meat
personalfinance,ffffbe8,t1_fffa4ae,1579882720.0,"You don't need to be extreme at couponing or sales to spend less cooking at home than eating out.  I do most of the grocery shopping and cooking at home and it's way less expensive than eating out.  I rarely use coupons (because I always forget to bring them) and the most I pay attention to sales is when I notice the yellow sticker saying there's a deal for PricePlus card users.  Now, I do agree with you that it is also very easy to overspend, but as long as you're not buying super expensive cuts of meat and all organic or out-of-season produce, you're ok.  You start to figure out pretty quickly what's worth buying and what isn't."
personalfinance,fffbn5z,t1_fffabph,1579880397.0,"While this does work, keto is very difficult to do properly.  You'll also be unhappy for a while because you'll have no energy while training your body to tap into its fat reserves earlier.  An easier way for beginners is to start tracking their macros more closely, adjust their diet to get the percentages right (for most people I've seen this means lowering carb intake and increasing protein, but not eliminating carbs altogether like with keto) and to begin ramping up their activity.  It doesn't have to be complicated and you don't really need to force your body to do anything way out of the ordinary."
personalfinance,fffb95r,t1_fffadts,1579880147.0,"you're mostly correct, but exercise is still needed.  It's obviously most important to take in less calories than you're burning, but you won't burn nearly as many without being active so you'll have to reduce your calories by a much larger amount if you want to lose weight.  The key is a balance of both."

Parenting,ffd2u09,t1_ffd20vq,1579812316.0,"Which is why I suggested the open dialogue and support.  I was bullied a lot as a child, but I did not have the ability to hide the fact that it bothered me.  As a parent, we have to somehow provide our kids with the support and example they need whilst simultaneously allowing them to learn lessons on their own.  It's EXTREMELY painful sometimes, and honestly the most difficult part of parenting for me so far.  Nevertheless, we must do what's best for our children in the long run, which sometimes involves letting them figure out situations on their own."

nfl,ffcxicd,t1_ffcv07a,1579809325.0,"I mean so much of this is subjective, whether we want to admit it or not.  Even if I quote stats, I'm attaching my own definition of how significant those stats are in that particular configuration, or applying perceived context.  So yeah, in the end your view is just as valid as mine.  We just happen to disagree, which is fine.  At the end of the day, from what I know of how the HoF operates, I'm quite sure Eli will be in.

nfl,ffcu1r9,t1_ffclxxz,1579807257.0,"4th quarter comebacks is a pretty specific and narrow stat, so I wouldn't use it as a qb's only qualifier. To me it doesn't mean much when his more important career stats (completion percentage, any/a, td-int ratio, etc) are not that great. I give him credit for his longevity and durability, as he never took unnecessary hits and protected himself extremely well. But I do think, overall, he was mediocre for pretty much his entire career. Just my onion, however, so feel free to disregard as you see fit."

UpliftingNews,ffc7mbb,t1_ffbu18c,1579793396.0,"I think the idea, as they say, is to reform taxes so ALL the rich people have to pay, not just them.  That would equate to far more money than just this handful of people donating voluntarily."

Parenting,ffc4oce,t3_esqwgf,1579791443.0,"Personally, if the daughter says she's not bothered by it and it's not being used directly at her, I would not confront or escalate the situation.  What I WOULD do is start and keep an open dialogue with your daughter about it, in case it does start to bother her at some point.  She already has the right attitude, to not let it bother her because it's pathetic, so continue to reinforce that and support her, making sure it stays that way.  I'm all for discouraging direct bullying, but we can't always fight our kids' battles for them.  If she can learn to let petty crap like this roll off her back easily, she'll be MUCH better prepared for adulthood when she gets there.  Gotta think big picture here."

AmItheAsshole,ffc1euw,t3_esrtrc,1579789090.0,"NTA, but the guy may be losing out on more than just severance.  In most places you can collect funemployment if you're terminated for non-conduct reasons, but cannot if you quit voluntarily.  I dunno how it works with small businesses though, you'd know better.  I think you would be justified in letting him go out like that, but if the scenario I listed is true you might consider processing him as a termination anyway.  It's totally up to you, you wouldn't be an asshole for not doing it."
