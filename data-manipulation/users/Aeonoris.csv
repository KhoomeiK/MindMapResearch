Pathfinder_RPG,felvt3f,t1_fekw78o,1579232186.0,"I don't think slaads (slaadi?) would be difficult at all to convert.  Innate spellcasting is more or less the same in P2 as 5e (as I understand), and the only other complicated thing is the disease.  That's mostly a narrative thing anyway, and so wouldn't be hard to make work in any system.

I am a little iffy on the idea of giving the death slaad advantage on all saving throws vs magic, though.  I think it's there to fix the same problem that the *incapacitation* trait in P2e fixes - namely, that some spells are too powerful against boss monsters.  If you do want them to have extra countermeasures against spells, I'd give them a reaction instead of a passive effect."
Pathfinder_RPG,felp21z,t3_epo8an,1579227471.0,"I understand why you might be tempted to price it as a scaling cost instead of flat (since it technically scales), but the effect is really not that strong.  Making it a scaling cost would incentivize the player to switch weapons soon, and making it a flat cost incentivizes using the cool thing they found."

Pathfinder_RPG,fedb79a,t3_eof94n,1579006375.0,"12 is correct as people have said, but here's a way of explaining it:

Calling the DC ""0"", -10 is critical failure, and 10 is critical success.  If you get a positive number under 10, you succeed!  If you get a negative number above -10, you fail.  ""But wait,"" you may say, ""0 is neither positive nor negative!"".  That's correct, but the designers decided that it counts as a positive for this purpose, rather than making you reroll.  

As a result, the person doing the rolling theoretically has a very slight edge, and that's fine."
Pathfinder_RPG,feda87v,t1_fecvux2,1579005431.0,"You're correct about everything except the end there - the ranges *are* different because of what you explained previously.  The range for normal failures is 9, because the 10th failure value is a critical failure.

The (incorrect) way the player is arguing for would actually match the number of normal success and normal failure values.  This is because the DC itself is a success value."
