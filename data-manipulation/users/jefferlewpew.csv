There's also a difference between the standard beans they use for espresso, the alternative beans that is that month's specialty (so you need to ask what kind of roast it is instead of blindly agreeing, you're not gonna like it if you're a blonde roast fan and it turns out to be a dark roast month), and the filter coffee is another type of bean, as well as cold press. Frappuccinos taste better if you ask them to use a hot espresso shot instead of the cold frappuccino coffee stuff (I forget what it's called in Starbucks land)

Recipes also seems to change depending on country, because I live in Edinburgh so we'd get a lot of American tourists and they'd always ask for cream and complain it wasn't sweet enough, whereas European tourists would ask for half syrup if they wanted it flavoured. I went to Japan a few years back and popped into Starbucks once, theirs also tasted very different - much more savoury
