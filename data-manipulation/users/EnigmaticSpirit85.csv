Emotional: My special needs son strangling me. The aftermath of that left me numb, including how everyone, including the services intended to help, judged me. Assumed I was a bad mother."
AskReddit,fg2s6wa,t3_ewjrmo,1580453715.0,"I used to play MMOs with a guild that was half english, half Russian. The Russian side initially came across as really short, bossy and toxic. Really upset me and I almost left.

One of the raid leaders took me aside and explained Russian culture to me, and that their criticism was intended to help me improve.

So I asked one of the more vocal members of the Russian side how to improve. It was actually really well received and eventually I was a regular feature of their raid groups.

So in answer to your question, Russian gamers. Damn but I miss those guys sometimes.
