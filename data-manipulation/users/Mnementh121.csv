amianasshole,ffi6xvw,t1_ffi65st,1579966706.0,"You are in a tight position.  A girlfriend telling you to get rid of a friend always comes off wrong.  It feels controlling and that is not what you want to be.  Let him bring it up and just say ""You could always step back from them and make some new friends to spend time with.""  I would probably listen as a guy as long as she included a sound reason that I also feel.  

I had this friend who was close to me and we were roommates for 2 years also.  She was fun and nice and I really liked her as a friend.  But she would judge things.  Friends I brought home or diet choices or my grades.  It made me a bit uncomfortable over time.  After she moved out I cot much closer to better friends.  I still talk to her sometimes but if we never parted I would not know my wife.  But it takes someone telling me plainly what a real objective issue is sometimes.

I wasted good time with people who were decent people but not the best for me all the time.  I don't speak to them much and I wish I would have used the valuable college time to make friends with people that 35 year old me would want to still talk to.  I made those friends but did not properly cultivate those relationships.  

Also, I get to manic states sometimes too.  I get stressed, scared, confused and I want solutions and I feel alone.  Try not to make big decisions without thinking during this time.  

Do not try to control the boyfriend.  If he is not making time for you, talk to him about it.  Do not blame the loose girl who he spends time with.   If it doesn't work out you can always split up peacefully.  What you will not be seeing from your perspective at your age is that you and everyone around you is rapidly changing.  This year's best friend may be less close next year.  It is okay to leave friends behind and make new.  We call these ""old friends"" and you can still visit or say hi now and again.  That boyfriends sounds like he is timely when he arrived but may be drifting away.  If that is the case then the worst thing you'd people do is try to trap each other in decaying relationships.  If he is stuck with his friends taking his time he maybe he needs to learn to say no sometimes then too.

The point is.  The viewers feel threatened by any contradictory facts and therefore do not listen to them so they do not have to find a way for them to fit or justify it.  I remember that facts that come from a force in contradiction with me were bigger threats.  So a liberal telling me something meant I had to argue.  Someone in the conservative sphere being somewhat contradictory was an ""ally"" and did not need argued.  I could ignore it or issue my correction.  In the allies I knew they were ""smart"" because conservative.  It was such programming and I always remember being an asshole for a long time back then.  I voted for Bush :(."

Our base was attacked by enemy terrorist iran.  But we will take their oil to pay for it.  Most people don't know how much oil they have....but it is a lot believe me."""
