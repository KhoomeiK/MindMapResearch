That blancing act collapsed and they were totally demolished in one fell swoop in 1994, the first midterm with a Democrat in the WH since 1978 and the culture wars in full swing."
insanepeoplefacebook,ff725uu,t1_ff6vo5p,1579639619.0,"Ok, let's go one by one:

1.  Higher PROPORTION of Republicans voted for the CRA, but higher NUMBERS of Democrats voted for it ,for the simple reason Democrats had enormous majorities in both houses of Congress. And within this majority, liberals were the majority, so yes, liberal Democrats were a stronger faction than liberal REpublicans (who were about to go into terminal decline, but that's another topic.) See the numbers, in this link:
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#By_party


2. That is true. But notice that Rockefeller was destroyed by Goldwater in 1964, and MLK ended up breaking with Nixon when he broke hard right on civil rights during the 1968 election. AGain: I have already acknowledged that liberal Republicans existed- it's just that they were politically weak.


3. And as for the chronology of African American support for Republicans,I am sorry,but you couldn't be more wrong.  For overall data, see here, especially the second chart, showing how no Republican got more than 40 percent of African American vote for president since 1936.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/07/when-did-black-americans-start-voting-so-heavily-democratic/ For a look how this worked on the local level, see this, from the official website of the House of Representatives. 
https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/BAIC/Historical-Essays/Keeping-the-Faith/Party-Realignment--New-Deal/ (Basically, the story is that by the 1930s, the Republicans were giving nothing but lip service to civil rights, because African Americans were voting for them anyway. At that point, the Depression hit, and African American voters decided to punish Hoover by voting for FDR. And at that point, lots of younger ambitious African Americans switched parties, because while the Democrats were the party of the Dixiecrats, in the north, the new deal opened up all sorts of avenues of advancement. As a result, northern African Americans became a democratic constituency long before the beginning of civil righs era)."

2. When trying to do hypotheticals, the obvious question is less ""would these opinions  on issue X make someone conservative today"" and more ""how did someone's opinions compare to other people's opinions, and how did opinions of people similar to him evolved. And by that measure, saying that MLK would be a Republican due to his views on gay people is.. daft, as pretty much all civil rights leader from his generation who are still alive are on board with gay rights. 
3. ""but Republicans were the party that championed civil rights at the time""
I could write six, sixty, or six hundred paragraphs about the topic, but plenty of historians did that already, and they are all in agreement that you are, at best, simplifying, and at worst, full of shit. Both parties had liberal and conservative wings. Liberals in both parties supported civil rights, and conservatives in both parties opposed them, albeit for different reasons- racism for Dixiecrats, concerns about federal action for Republicans. The liberal wing of the Democratic party was stronger and ascendant, while the liberal wing of the Republicans was a declining force.  Therefore, while the civil rights movement did not have anything against republicans per se, it ended up closely working with Democrats, and totally abandoning the GOP after the Goldwater nomination. Those are the fact, even if they disagree with the last 100 videos of Prager owning the libs you watched.
4. You didn't say MLK would be hostile to gay rights.You said he might be a Republican today because he was a pastor. Which is again, totally ignores the existence of the African American church, and it's alliance with the Democratic party."

That blancing act collapsed and they were totally demolished in one fell swoop in 1994, the first midterm with a Democrat in the WH since 1978 and the culture wars in full swing."
insanepeoplefacebook,ff725uu,t1_ff6vo5p,1579639619.0,"Ok, let's go one by one:

1.  Higher PROPORTION of Republicans voted for the CRA, but higher NUMBERS of Democrats voted for it ,for the simple reason Democrats had enormous majorities in both houses of Congress. And within this majority, liberals were the majority, so yes, liberal Democrats were a stronger faction than liberal REpublicans (who were about to go into terminal decline, but that's another topic.) See the numbers, in this link:
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#By_party


2. That is true. But notice that Rockefeller was destroyed by Goldwater in 1964, and MLK ended up breaking with Nixon when he broke hard right on civil rights during the 1968 election. AGain: I have already acknowledged that liberal Republicans existed- it's just that they were politically weak.


3. And as for the chronology of African American support for Republicans,I am sorry,but you couldn't be more wrong.  For overall data, see here, especially the second chart, showing how no Republican got more than 40 percent of African American vote for president since 1936.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/07/07/when-did-black-americans-start-voting-so-heavily-democratic/ For a look how this worked on the local level, see this, from the official website of the House of Representatives. 
https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/BAIC/Historical-Essays/Keeping-the-Faith/Party-Realignment--New-Deal/ (Basically, the story is that by the 1930s, the Republicans were giving nothing but lip service to civil rights, because African Americans were voting for them anyway. At that point, the Depression hit, and African American voters decided to punish Hoover by voting for FDR. And at that point, lots of younger ambitious African Americans switched parties, because while the Democrats were the party of the Dixiecrats, in the north, the new deal opened up all sorts of avenues of advancement. As a result, northern African Americans became a democratic constituency long before the beginning of civil righs era)."

2. When trying to do hypotheticals, the obvious question is less ""would these opinions  on issue X make someone conservative today"" and more ""how did someone's opinions compare to other people's opinions, and how did opinions of people similar to him evolved. And by that measure, saying that MLK would be a Republican due to his views on gay people is.. daft, as pretty much all civil rights leader from his generation who are still alive are on board with gay rights. 
3. ""but Republicans were the party that championed civil rights at the time""
I could write six, sixty, or six hundred paragraphs about the topic, but plenty of historians did that already, and they are all in agreement that you are, at best, simplifying, and at worst, full of shit. Both parties had liberal and conservative wings. Liberals in both parties supported civil rights, and conservatives in both parties opposed them, albeit for different reasons- racism for Dixiecrats, concerns about federal action for Republicans. The liberal wing of the Democratic party was stronger and ascendant, while the liberal wing of the Republicans was a declining force.  Therefore, while the civil rights movement did not have anything against republicans per se, it ended up closely working with Democrats, and totally abandoning the GOP after the Goldwater nomination. Those are the fact, even if they disagree with the last 100 videos of Prager owning the libs you watched.
4. You didn't say MLK would be hostile to gay rights.You said he might be a Republican today because he was a pastor. Which is again, totally ignores the existence of the African American church, and it's alliance with the Democratic party."

therewasanattempt,fcwh80z,t1_fcwfwmp,1578025552.0,"Fine: for president, we have the electoral college. Here is what Federalist 68 says about the electoral college: 
""It was equally desirable, that the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations.""

I.E, the people cannot be trusted to elected the leaders directly- but they can vote for people to make that decision for them.

For the Senate, the 17th amendment was passed specifically because until then, state legislators, not voters, elected Senators. 

As for the House, unlike the Senate and the President, it is the one body elected directly by the people 
""The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.
""

As for specifically legislative powers of the House: 

""All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.


Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States""
