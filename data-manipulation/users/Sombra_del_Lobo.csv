I worked in the adult industry for 3 years after the economy collapsed starting in 2008. I was a personal trainer at  high end gym in 2007 and lost 40% of my clientele do to the Great Recession. I was desperate, in amazing physical condition and was going out to dinner/dance nights with two women at a time. My head got swole an I figured I could do some porn. 

I'm an amazing lover but suck at porn. 

So I became a recruiter/IT guy/ driver/photographer at a model house in Porn Valley in L.A. Yadda yadda yadda, find out one of the guys I was working with was also a dealer, he left his product out in public, I picked it up to give it to him later the next day , two hours later I got stopped for the first time in YEARS ( another long story). With 5 grams of grams of coke. Boom. Felony.

Anyways, I'm so happy to have found the Supernatural community. Again, this is just a story about how I ( and many others in SuperMax) found out about Sam, Dean, and Baby. One love."
