Bad part=they kill birds and other wildlife important to the eco system 

I assume that if the cats are introduced to love as kittens they can be more easily captured then spayed and neutered to keep the populations down. AND perhaps even tame enough to adopt out like the two cats we adopted."

I live about an hour from the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California and have been there many times. The otter tank there is extremely popular. 

Sea otters are smart. They are one of the few mammals that use tools. They use a rock as a hammer or anvil to pry open mussels and clams.   

Once when kayaking in Monterey Bay I saw otters right next to me! I had heard clicking and discovered that it was an otter. It had a rock on its belly and was smacking a clam on it. Pretty cool to see."

There’s a plaque on the spot where he stood when he gave “I have a dream” speech and people waited in line to get a picture to stand on that spot. 

When it was my turn I didn’t expect the intensity of emotion I’d feel but I teared up.  

Read his speech.

LasVegas,fe3h0ro,t3_enmdao,1578849172.0,"We were in Vegas between Christmas and New Years and it was a blast. 

One of the top three buffets in Vegas is the Bacchanal buffet in Caesars with over 500 dishes!  We did Groupon for $35 because without it’s 80.  You can stay for two hours but they don’t enforce it. We went for late breakfast. At 11 they bring out the succulent prime rib and three types of crab legs. Save room for dessert and their gelato bar!

Side trip to Valley of Fire was worthwhile. Only an hour away. Really amazing. 

Shows-Blue Man Group in the Luxor was not just a show it was an experience. We had seats up front just three rows from the stage-well worth it. There’s a lot going on and it’s great to be immersed in it! Very creative! 

Have fun in Vegas!"

Bring snacks, food and water before heading out there-not much around that area. 

Definitely worth it. Only had about 4 hours and wish we had at least six. 

Another quirky thing we did was go to EthelM chocolate factory. Go at dusk-nightfall to see the cacti garden lit up with 5 million Christmas lights. They start putting them up in July!  Not sure if they still have the lights up. May want to call about that. It’s free! But do have to pay for the chocolate. Try the divine dark chocolate with lemon. 

We were in Vegas last week and did both of these. Really fun and something different."
