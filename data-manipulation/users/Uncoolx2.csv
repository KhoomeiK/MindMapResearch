Think of it like the old ""Free checking account with a balance over $1000.""

If you keep the balance over $1000 by making deposits (positive experiences), you will be ""in love.""

If you make too many withdrawals, and the balance falls below $1000, you will be ""out of love.""

Some deposits you may not know about (your physical attractiveness can be a deposit), others you will (having an argument).

A good relationship relies on making deposits and avoiding withdrawals.

Avoiding withdrawals requires communication and cooperation - ""I don't like it when you leave your socks on the floor."" So, stop leaving socks on the floor.

""Withdrawal notices"" should be communicated respectfully, and without judgement.

If you are unwilling to commit to changing your behavior for your partner, or allowing your partner the opportunity to make changes for you, your relationships will all fail. Or, you can keep searching/waiting for ""the one.""

I was just fortunate I became aware of it before life gave me things to ruminate on.

I noticed the rumination and the mood - and my life was fucking great then.
So now? Nothing. But depression loves diving in the dusty drawers for old pains.

Most of the time I handle it by being a workaholic. Until I overdo it and contemplate suicide. Then I overthink the methods, and decide ""fuck that, failing that would suck."" Or it's just a scary fucking method.

The scariest thing ever, though, was imagining a tolerable method.

Thankfully, my next thought was my wife or kids finding my corpse.

That fucked me up.

Maybe sometimes I don't care for myself, but I love my family and have no illusions about how bad it would fuck them up.

Edit: fine - go read up on The Venus of Willendorf a bit.

We watched a documentary about it in a sociology class, and they linked exaggerated proportions to animal behaviors - both mating and feeding behaviors.

Organisms that reproduce sexually are thus driven to sexual behavior, thus signals of sexuality are stimulating.

Additionally, the less parental involvement in a species typically means more offspring to compensate for loss.


Additional human mating oddities include testicle size, oenis shape and size, cryptic ovulation, and persistently pendulous breasts.
