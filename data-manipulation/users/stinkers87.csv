Investments snowball in growth and the younger you get your shit together and put these measures in place the more you can enjoy financial security earlier in life.

After you've done that then go out and enjoy what you've earned.

In the UK there's a huge pensions gap for millennials where they've paid in too little too late, primarily because they've been stiffed by the older generations and a screwed up housing market. They (myself included) do need to invest invest invest sadly."
unpopularopinion,ff93gw9,t3_esbzgm,1579703923.0,"I totally agree with you on this'll one. It really pisses me off when people say, 'oh well, at least I don't have...' 

One person's suffering does not negate your suffering. They're totally independent.

If you followed their logic to it's grim conclusion you'd go around torturing kittens so you could say, 'I'm not sad because my life is nowhere near as bad as all these kittens' lives I've just destroyed through gruesome torture'."

I'll just have to wait until I'm old enough not to care.

Thanks for the advice man."

AmItheAsshole,ff8tbb9,t1_ff8n55t,1579695302.0,"I agree with this but I'm going NAH . In my family we thank each other for whatever they do, even if it's their responsibility, as you said - thanks for the lovely meal, thank you for the cup of tea, or taking out the rubbish bins. It sounds silly but if I don't get the rote learnt thanks it hurts a little. 

Don't beat yourself or him up too much over it. Having a new baby is a stressful time and tensions will run high. It's easy to lash out and get angry or upset with those you love most over silly things."
unpopularopinion,ff8qqga,t1_ff8drzi,1579692174.0,"What the fuck is happening to the English language. It's painful, and thick as an adjective for a woman. When did that word become a good thing?! It all sounds degrading and shit. Sadly at 30 I'm old now."
dataisbeautiful,fed9v1l,t1_fed85ep,1579005061.0,"I'm no meteorologist or historian, but I don't think people had the industrial capability at the time to make such a singular blip in global temperature and were we able to the effects would have been longer lasting and smeared out over the years to come.

Moreover the global reconstruction effort post war would have pumped out significantly more greenhouses gasses and pollutants to reconstruct the damage of the war than those needed to cause the destruction in the first place.

Great question though. I don't have sources as I haven't read into this stuff since I was an undergraduate 12 years ago."

worldnews,fe1kshm,t1_fe1ikxn,1578827726.0,"Good work keeping up the memory mate.

My grandad came back from WW2 too traumatised to talk about anything other than one raid on a farm in Germany where he sent his best friend left around a barn and he went right, his mate got mowed down by Germans and I guess he went the other way and killed them for it and survived. He never forgave himself and lived with the trauma until he died. That and the artillery shelling and acting as a runner under sniper fire.

I can't believe he carry his memories alone and he never shared them but I wish I could know more. He's dead now. I'm going to try and research his career in the national archive to see where his regiment went and what he did. Don't give up. It's a gift you know those stories and pass them on to your grandkids and beyond. He lived 80 years depressed and anxious with 'broken nerves' and no support. Even his family didn't get it for sixty years until mental health became accessible and even then he wouldn't take it because of his generations social stigma towards it. A hero in war and bypassed by the country he gave his life to. In the end he spent his last 15 years retired just waiting to die to escape

Edit: nonsensical grammar in second paragraph."
dataisbeautiful,fdrcyot,t1_fdnjtd9,1578682704.0,"Wow, thanks man. I was completely barking up the wrong tree there. I had no idea these things were even going on, let alone their specifications. I had a pretty simplistic view of these instruments and had no idea people were hedging out to 35 years. I'm surprised they've got liquidity?! 

Do know of a good concise report to read to get me back up to speed? I used to read the OPEC world oil outlook and I think they do monthly bulitens, but you've got to take it with a pinch of salt. 

Thanks for for filling me in."
