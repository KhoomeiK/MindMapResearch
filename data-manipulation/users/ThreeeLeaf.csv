Dogtraining,ff2w6uk,t1_ff2w3ag,1579526473.0,"He hasn't tried to bite my sister yet,but I don't want it to escalate. He bit my sister's friend and also a man we hired to paint our walls. Neither were hurt but still."
Dogtraining,ff2swrf,t1_ff2d5ch,1579522769.0,"She brings in treats sometimes to calm him down, but he is never really quiet on these occasions so we can't reward him for that."
Dogtraining,ff2svfu,t1_ff2n9vn,1579522724.0,"She is 17.  He looks at my door when he does this. Sometimes sitting, sometimes standing. He is a ten year old lab chow chow mix that we rescued 4 years ago.

He has access to my room throughout the day and naps there as well. He is very attached to it. When I close the door he runs up and down the stairs or paces in the hallway waiting to get back in.  You are right that he is fine during the day and has no problems with my sister. When she comes home from school he is very happy to see her."
Dogtraining,ff2slmh,t1_ff2ls6u,1579522372.0,"We have bought him a few dog beds in the past that he never sits on. We've tried giving him treats when he goes there but he will get right off. Crate training failed because my dad fucked up and tried forcing him into the crate which made him very afraid of it.

He had some training when we first got him, but we've been kind of lax about it. I've started up again with clicker training. I will ask her to join me when I train him."
Dogtraining,ff2sgfh,t1_ff2cjic,1579522181.0,"No he just started doing it about a year ago. He is ten years old, a lab/chow chow mix. My sister is almost 17."
Dogtraining,ff2sf04,t1_ff2bc7s,1579522129.0,She comes in randomly to tell me things that are interesting or funny. She woke me up last night to tell me our favorite movie won an award lol. He will growl even if she doesn't come in though.
Dogtraining,ff2scn1,t1_ff2b37i,1579522041.0,"In this case though, if I am giving him treats, will he think I am rewarding him for growling? Also any links would be great!"
Choices,fer3fin,t1_feqvzum,1579349326.0,You're right. This is making me think because I chose Flynn and I don't even remember him being an asshole at first but I remember Jackie. I guess I've been biased too and I appreciate you pointing it out.
Choices,fer2ry5,t1_fepetis,1579349014.0,It seems to happen on books where you're monogamous. That way people with Ajay and Rory can still spend money on Skye.
Choices,feo06td,t1_fen81xp,1579293355.0,I wouldn't mind reusing D&D faces or Bloodbound faces. They are both gorgeous and I've played every race of MC from OH and still had to reuse several times!
Choices,fenzqq0,t1_fenud65,1579293096.0,Eh I dislike both of them. Not saying the way they acted is anywhere near the same level. Ethan was worse obviously. I feel like he had a very high chance of emotionally scarring MC with the way he treated her when she was vulnerable.
Choices,fenu32k,t1_fensuuo,1579290724.0,They also do it with Kaitlyn from TFS and Skye from HSS:CA. Not sure if there are others though. I guess this would make it only black people and lesbians which isn't any better.
Choices,fent8ry,t1_fennsvr,1579290464.0,"That's a good point. I adore black Nik. Nik was so aloof that it felt so meaningful how close we became. In real life the ""nice"" characters would be interesting but here the relationships can feel forced if they happen too fast. The closed off/rivalry/mysterious characters get slow burn relationships which are way better. The mold is broken on Jackie though because she wasnt a ""nice guy"" and is very unpopular. I think characters like Jackie, Ethan, and Justin were just too nasty too often."
Choices,fensbar,t3_eq3qvt,1579290059.0,"I haven't played all of these books yet, but I choose my LIs based on personality and often times it feels like the black LI doesn't get as much writing in the story to make them a well rounded character or the most appealing choice. Lily for example, is objectively less interesting than the other LIs in bloodbound because she's an outsider to the supernatural world like MC is at first and just makes a lot of nerd references most of the time. 

Jackie from OH was just an asshole to MC for no reason so it really turned me off of her. Sorry for trying to be a good doctor I guess? Her apology was too little too late after being antagonized for so long. There wasnt enough writing to flesh her out so it just came off as very unreasonable and one dimensional. I chose Bryce because he was so kind and fun to be around.

I do think Dallas is less popular because of his race though because he is incredible. Sawyer is kind of boring imo and the women got no screen time so I dont even know what they are supposed to be like. 

D&D's popularity contest is probably due to everyone on this sub being obsessed with Sinclaire. I am too attached to Annabelle to go for anyone else."

curlyhair,feiu8t9,t1_feishyx,1579147360.0,"Thank you that's sweet :)

After reading all the responses here I am going to switch to a mousse and then I'm going to change my shampoo and conditioner to the blue kale nym stuff because I've read good things about it. Fingers crossed!"
curlyhair,feig8dq,t1_feid1rw,1579137807.0,Thanks I'll look into that one!
curlyhair,feig5s7,t1_feicbog,1579137757.0,"I put some in the palm of my hand, rub my hands together,run them through my hair, and then scrunched with my hands. A towel would be better?

Also what mousse do you recommend?"
curlyhair,fei6ie4,t1_fei6dxl,1579131370.0,Thank you! Also I've never gotten a cut like this. Should I show up with my hair with no product in it or try and get it as curly as possible so they know what I'm going for?

Frugal,fehzacp,t1_fefud0w,1579126898.0,"How does one learn something like this? I know how to follow a recipe, but the food is usually quote mediocre. Everyone in the blog comments will say it is delicious and my food never comes out like the photos so I think there is some skillset I must be missing.

Restaurant food is miles ahead anything I've ever made."
freebies,fehyn8h,t3_envhuo,1579126513.0,Could these be used as regular menstrual pads or do they function differently for incontinence?
Choices,fehxa64,t1_fehmy7l,1579125701.0,Yeah I had to look her up. She's the rich daughter that Brian was creeping on at that one dinner scene.
depression,fedrib6,t1_fedo306,1579018330.0,Haha yeah it is strange I know. I'm lucky to have the support of my parents so the low wages they pay are not as devastating to me. Also I stayed with the same company but switched malls and the customers in the new mall are almost shockingly kind. Sometimes we have other employees come to help us out and they always comment on how nice our customers are.

depression,fedlyit,t3_eoky9h,1579014785.0,"For me personally, I dont offer advice very often because I dont really know enough about success and happiness for my advice to be valid. I am scared to do more harm than good. The two things that helped lessen my depression the most were my psychiatrist finding the right drug cocktail and getting a retail job because it helped me practice talking with people all day and boosted my confidence in myself and my ability to work hard(important for someone who used to spend 8 hours or more in bed physically unable to stand up). But me going to people and saying hey take drugs and get a job seems more insulting than anything. So I usually just read vents and get a bit sad."
depression,fedlhcg,t3_eogx53,1579014464.0,Hey man just wanted to say I went through your post history(not to be creepy lol I was gonna see if you wanted to meet up for a hug and a kiss. I've never kissed anyone either) and you seem to act like you truly hate women. There's a lot of disrespect and anger there and if they can pick up on this stuff in your real world interactions it's probably the reason they won't get closer to you. Sure there's other shit. People are hard as hell to talk to. Many people People are assholes who judge on looks and money and social status. But no woman is going to be able to get closer to a man who thinks she's a shallow degenerate bitch because of her gender. It's painful to have an ideology like this. To yourself and the people around you. Good luck to you sir and I hope you can find help.
