Maybe a nice top or pair of jeans in a couple sizes smaller and you will feel amazing when you fit in them. Treat yourself! Go out for a meal or pizza with friends, don't go silly eating your actual weight in carbs, bit hell don't starve or you will be miserable. Moderation means you can calorie count but still be happy. Diets don't work long term but changing shitty eating habits do."
