facepalm,ffg60jx,t1_fff8sar,1579899204.0,Have any cites for the Avast shady chinese interests? I can't find anything except they bought AVG and Piriform. They have a Venture firm from Luxembourg invested in them. I can't find anything about anything chinese related to them.

jellyfin,fcuu7t1,t3_eizkty,1577988596.0,"Jellyfin autodetects files on my system. Sonarr and Radarr do their thing and Jellyfin picks them up on it's own. 

From a github bug report:

“Real time monitoring” is in the advanced settings for each library. It’s usually on by default. If you wanted to try the scheduled task route, that’s in the Dashboard under Expert>Scheduled Tasks. “Scan media library”.""

If these are setup correctly you may need to check the logs for errors.

Edit: according to the documentation, this is only supported on certain file systems but it doesn't say which.

Edit2: it comes up under each libraries settings after you enable the advanced settings slider."
modelrocketry,fcusqoh,t3_eiviyt,1577987767.0,"Do you wrap your lines around the chute (not recommended) or do you fold them into the chute?

I used to have a lot more twisted lines and deployment issues before I joined a club and learned how to fold them in. 

If you're unfamiliar, you lay out the chute with the lines to one side then fold the chute in half. Before you fold it in half again, pull the midpoint of your shrouds to the tip of the folded parachute. From here keep folding and then just slide the chute in. When its ejected the lines will help unfold the chute and the will not be twisted up. Leave the shock cord loose on top of the wadding."

After the first 10 minutes it wasn't bad at all. We lined up for the scorpion and only had one tag stolen. Only waited about 15 minutes in line and definitely added to my launch day awesomeness. It was very entertaining with a person at the front of the line organizing people, getting people grouped together and keeping things tidy. I loved it."
