gaming,ffd6typ,t1_ffcycjy,1579814555.0,"Honestly I'd prefer just give them costume options that change the name lol. Roy and Chrom are sufficiently different that you have to learn new stuff to play against the different characters. Dark Samus/Pit, Daisy, and the second Belmont are 99.9% fluff characters which, while kinda annoying, is fine.

I've given up hope on getting legitimately good at this game because the cast is too large and varied to be able to figure out what everyone does, how everyone moves, what jank to look out for, etc. so it's just a casual game for me now."
AskReddit,ffd5ebm,t1_ffbzz2v,1579813756.0,"Depending on when this was and how far the family traveled, even a fairly short Disney World trip can cost $1,000-$2,000 pretty easily.

What parents sometimes don't take in to account when planning and funding these trips are that while the experience is almost always remembered as positive and magical, they are universally exhausting, typically hot and/or rainy. Lines are grueling, the park hours are long (and often proceeded by a poor night's sleep to due a rough combo of unfamiliar bed and excitement), and it's all worse of they're coming from an even slightly more western time zone.

That's a lot of cash and effort for a understandably tired kid to not be having the time of his life.

Parents tend to remember how hot and unforgiving the experience was, kids rarely do. I try to be forgiving of rough parents in these situations. Alternatively some parents bring their kids because the parents love it, and are frustrated that they don't get the full experience anymore because their kids change the trip in a way that's usually less favorable for the adults."

Since a 10\* Valk isn't doing you many favors in PvP (aside from very early in a server), sucks at Seal Land, and will only get you anywhere in Aspen if you don't have anything else built, and you really aren't using her to reduce PvE boss damage if this is the case.

I'd probably hold on to her if I had built her up to 10\* just in case, but yeah she just doesn't have much going for her these days =( My E5 Valk is quite possibly my easiest character to swap out. Sucks that the 2 Garuda copies you can get from the invitation event are my first 2."

IdleHeroes,ff4btpc,t1_ff47jp5,1579559940.0,"> The game is a lot more than Seal Land, although that's the majority of what this subreddit talks about. 

There are 2 reasons for that, and they're both incredibly valid.

1) Seal Land is, by a rather absurd margin, the most productive return relative to investment. By building the #2 PvP shadow hero instead of the #1, you can be ahead multiple 5\* fodders a week and an ""elite"" hero every...however often. Given that fodders are virtually always the inhibitor to building non L/D heroes, this is a BIG. FUCKING. DEAL.

2) Support heroes can't win PvP, BS, Aspen, well ANYTHING on their own. You must virtually always build a carry hero first, then fill your remaining slots with those who round out the team most strongly. Since the % of players in this sub that already have more than 3 maxed out heroes is probably very quite small, your average person talking in this sub isn't particularly concerned with exactly which heroes at the strongest at this moment in time.

Take me, for example. When I was building my first hero, the strongest characters were Valk and Mihm. For a while there, it was fairly likely that 3+ Valk was *the* strongest team. Had I built a second Valk to E5 (I could have by now), I would be massively regretting that decision because by the time I was able to put my plan to fruition the hero that was once the strongest are now deemed mediocre.

This sub is 100% right in talking about which heroes to build first for the purpose of Seal Land, because telling everyone that Gustin > Horus would be legitimately bad advice for most people here."
