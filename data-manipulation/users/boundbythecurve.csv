The loss of control over our own political structures.

And when this democratic backsliding happens, both sides tends towards populism. In America, Left wing populism looks like Democratic Socialism, apparently. It looks like Bernie Sanders. There's nothing new to Bernie's platform mostly. It's all the same stuff he's been fighting for his entire career. Now there's simply a hunger for his policies in the public. 

American right wing populism looks like populism around the world, also apparently: fascism. The scapegoating of problems onto individual groups instead of the systems under which everyone operates. With Nazi's, the scapegoating was mostly with Jews, Blacks, Homosexuals, and Gypsies. With modern day China (which is more capitalist than communist by any reasonable metric), it's the Uyghurs.

Rabbits,ffc3b81,t1_ffbmkdd,1579790493.0,"I don't know if anyone can read your bun's mind, but I have some observations from my buns that might help.

We do free-roam, but indoor. So our buns are used to being given lots of freedom to explore too. But their ""normal"" is inside instead of outside, unlike your buns.

Something I noticed early on with my oldest, Kingsley, is his strange running patterns. When I take him outside, he'd explore down a direction, usually through some trees or bushes or around a corner of the house. Then, he'd suddenly sprint back the *exact* path he'd been exploring. It was weirdly specific. After months of watching him do this, I realized something; he's path-planning. He's mapping out a route, then practicing running through that route. 

But that was at the old house (we just moved in June). And I wasn't sure if that was a normal bunny behavior or just something weird Kingsley does. But in the new house, his path-planning changed slightly. Our yard got smaller, so there wasn't as much to run around. So instead he'd go to the corner of the yard that was furthest from the door that leads inside (the way back to his *home*), and sprint towards the door. 

Again, I wasn't sure if Kingsley was doing something normal buns do, or if he's just a weirdo. Turns out, this is a thing buns do, because our second bunny, Basil, basically does the same thing (and they're obviously not from the same litter, but they're also genetically pretty far apart. Kingsley = Holland lopp, Basil = Flemish giant mix. And here's what I think they're doing:

They're practicing their escape routes home. To a bunny, keeping a path back to safety must be paramount because they're prey animals. They always have to be ready to make a life-saving escape. And I think part of that is to always been aware of a path to get to safety, aka home. 

I'm not sure how your house/yard is laid out. But do you have to pickup your bunnies to get them inside? Or do you close some of the doors between inside and outside, and thus are blocking their way back to their home, outside? This might be one of the sources of stress. Your new bun doesn't feel comfortable exploring because they don't feel like they have an escape route (even though being outdoors is obviously more dangerous than being indoors, because of birds).

Sorry for the longish post. But I wanted to explain why I think this escape-planning path is important. But I'm also not a professional animal behavioral scientist. This is only from my personal observations and best guesses."

politics,ffalz4m,t3_esejy6,1579739066.0,"Alright, for everyone saying that this isn't a clear quote, let me put it into the context of what Trump was saying.

The initial question that he was answering was this: ""Is abuse of power an impeachable offense?""

The context here doesn't really add or subtract anything. And he rambles a bit, and never really answers the question, so the initial question isn't that important when trying to interpret the context.

I just transcribed his full ramble the best that I can. If you find an error, let me know so I can correct it.  

""Well you're gonna \[sic\] talk to the lawyers about it. But I will tell you, there's nothing here. I had a very innocent conversation with very fine gentleman \[pause\] from the Ukraine. And it was based on that- People don't even want to talk about the conversation. I got to watch glimpses in between all of these meetings I just told you about. I got to watch glimpses of what is taking place, wasting time in Washington. And I watched- they don't talk about my conversation. They don't talk about my transcripts. Remember this: When Schiff made up the phony story and he repeated it to congress and the world, and it was a totally phony story, then I released the transcript, there was supposed to be a second whistleblower. What happened to him? There wa- wait wait, otherwise I won't do your show. \[laughter from the room\] There was supposed to be an informer. What happened to the informer? All of these people disappeared. And when they saw this transcript they said ""we got problems"". But they went ahead because they were already there, because they- they- had a phony concocted story made up. So here's the story: \[i\] did nothing wrong. It was a perfect conversation. It was totally appropriate. The best lawyers in the world have looked at it. The department of justice has looked at it. Given it a sign off. There was nothing wrong. They never thought I was going to release the conversation. They probably didn't think we had transcribers, or that we had a trans- \[gurgles a bit?\] transcribed our tape. But they never thought they were going to release it. When we released that conversation all hell broke out with the Democrats because they said ""wait a minute because this is much different than \[sic\] shifty Schiff told us"", so...

**We're doing very well. I got to watch enough. I thought our team did a very good job. But honestly we have all the material. They don't have the material.**""

So there you have it. The entire response, word for word. The problem with parsing this out is Trump jumps around a bit (no surprise there). But I think his response paints a general context that clarifies what he means by ""material"".

He brings up the physical evidence in the case a lot towards the end of his ramble. He mentions the transcript several times before the few sentences in question. He mentions the other pieces leading up to the hearings, like the witnesses. But the final thing he's talking about, right before those finals sentences, is about the transcript, and how ""Dems didn't think we'd release it"". Which adds another dimension to the context. It's not just about the documents, but specifically how the WH released the documents.

And then he says ""But honestly, we have all the material. They don't have the material.""

In one of the comics, where the author tries to explain what depression is, she makes this fantastic analogy. She describes having depression as having a dead pet goldfish.

And that line just kinda summarized how woefully ignorant I was about her illness. So we used to bring relief when constructive words would have failed. Whenever she'd have a *bad* day, I'd just ask her ""Have you tried making them not dead?"" and we'd share in our little joke. It wasn't much, but it at least carried with it the acknowledgment that I have nothing to offer, in terms of advice. Just emotional support.

But reason is rarely the cause for minds to change significantly. Yes, ultimately the reasons I changed my beliefs so much was because of the slow erosion from good arguments and evidence. However, I've confronted people with the same beliefs I used to have with the evidence that changed my mind.....to no avail. Multiple times, over and over.

And maybe it's my delivery methods. I used to be much more abrasive, but I'm working on it. I've learned that *how* you say something is equally important as *what* you say.

But even then, I can't consistently change people's minds. And I'm coming to the conclusion that's because the human mind isn't meant to change like that. I know we all hate identity politics, but the truth is everything is about identity. We're such identity based creatures that even facts and reason can't override our beliefs about ourselves.

Think of the surveys about the ACA vs. Obamacare. Republicans hate Obamacare, but love the ACA, not realizing they're the same thing. That's all identity. They can't like a ***socialist (?!)*** policy. They're a god fearing, Republican who pulls themselves up by their own bootstraps. But that thing the pays for their healthcare? That's pretty sweet.

Changing minds isn't about winning points like in a high school debate. It's about convincing someone to change a part of their identity. We're made of our beliefs, so abandoning them is like dropping a piece of yourself. And that takes time. And willingness to change. And honestly, most people aren't willing to try.

It's not all one thing (though it's certainly exploitative, by it's nature). However, there are inherent limits of what capitalism can do. And when others examined those limits more carefully (and then I followed in their footsteps by reading about their work), they've realized that it's a system that can only function through the exploitation of others.

Whenever you create a market for something, you guarantee that some percentage of the population can't own whatever is being sold. That's just the nature of markets. If everyone owns a can-opener, then the can-opener market wouldn't exist, because you couldn't convince anyone to buy one. Why would they? They already own one.

So if we create a market for purses....most people would say 'that's fine', because it's something that not everyone needs. But what about food and shelter? Are we ok with living in a society that will ***always*** have homeless and hungry?

I'm not. 

And I know we can't fix every injustice everywhere.

It turns out, it's not about our ability to *produce* resources. Because we can produce/use resources in all kinds of ways. Ethical and unethical. But how those resources get *distributed* is the crux of my problems with capitalism. Sure, it's one way to make wealth. But it will never achieve the level of economic egalitarianism I (and I'd hope most people) would want.

I want to socialize all of our human needs, for everyone. Those needs are changing, and will always change, but that's what socializing a market does. It guarantees needs for the people, not for profit."

ezraklein,feefab8,t3_eon3i2,1579032565.0,"The Booker interview, for me, was something special as well. During one of the many of DNC debates, I had heard a half-baked plan from him regarding the newest wave of the housing mark- er I mean crisis. And this plan immediately turned me off to his politics. The specifics of the plan aren't terribly important anymore, but the plan seemed to so dramatically misunderstand economics, that I considered him an empty candidate.

But since I never saw anything specific come from the ""plan"", combined with the off-the-cuff nature of the suggestion, I'll just chalk that blunder-of-a-plan up to him trying to win some desperately needed political points on a crowded stage.

This interview made me realize how very similar Booker and I are, specifically in how we see politics, morality, and what radicialism should look like. And honestly, all his dodging and refusal to put clear lines in the sand made me identify with him even more. I know that sounds strange. And I know we all want clear policy agendas. But hearing him struggle with these moral compasses was both comforting and invigorating. Even knowing that sometimes we just fall on opposites sides of logistical question of power/politics only makes me like him more. He's actually asking (what I consider to be) the right questions! And they're the tougher, bigger questions that milk-toast candidates like Buttigieg and Biden are too chickenshit to ask.

Within a finite game, like an election cycle or an impeachment proceeding, we start with the assumption that all parties have agreed to the rules for determining a winner and loser. But what actions should we take when we have little power in those games, and the other side is clearly, blatantly cheating?

Do we take our ball and go home? Can we? Do we buckle down and keeping scoring an endless number of goals, despite the ever-moving goalposts? Do we compromise who we are as a team in order to win half a loaf with a few of the less slimy opponents?

I wish I had all the answers to these questions (though at this point, I'm starting to think there aren't any true singular answers to these questions). And clearly Booker struggles with them too. He's not blind to the clear rule-breaking. He's just so dogmatically practical that he'll push away other teammates to achieve solid political successes via cooperation with his opponents, short-lived as those successes are. I only hope that when the opportunity comes for him, he'll be able to truly upheave our dilapidated political systems, and choose to not work with his opponents whose clear goals are to preserve said dilapidations.

Booker is now on my watch-closely list of Dems. I'll eat my hat if his name doesn't come up on the national stage again, soon. Heck, probably before this year is out (here's hoping he's someone's VP)."

ezraklein,fdoghmt,t1_fdlmggb,1578604668.0,"I had some more thoughts about why Bernie's millionaire status is pretty unimportant overall. I know that wasn't a big point in the episode, but I really loath the weaponization of identities, so I thought I'd provide another concrete reason why Bernie being a millionaire doesn't *really* matter. And it mostly it has to do with our number system being in base ten.

Let me jump to an example of what I mean. Everyone talks about the first 100 days of the presidency as being a defining period for the start of a new presidency. FDR was the first presidency to really make a point of it via his radio address. And ultimately, the only reason we still use that number to measure the early success of our presidencies is because.... we all use that number to measure the early success of our presidencies.

There's nothing inherently special about 100 days vs 110 days or 90 days. The number 100, in this case, is believed to come from Napoleon's achievement of taking Paris in 100 days after escaping Elba island, and his former exile. And ever since then, we've tried to compare every American leader's accomplishments to what Napoleon was able to accomplish in that amount of time. That's pretty arbitrary, historically speaking. Neither people are (hopefully) trying to accomplish the same things. Napoleon was waging a war to take control of the capital. No presidents have had to start the presidency by taking DC by force (though Trump does like causing a lot of America's worst ""firsts"", so we'll see what happens in 2020).

And more importantly, listen to the news when that first 100 days is brought up. Nobody is actually making a Napoleon comparison. And that's because the specific number is traditional, and not based on some inherent trait of the US presidency, or political power more broadly. We could all agree that we'll judge the first 120 days of a presidency, and that would be equally as significant as the 100 days.

But here's the kicker: Napoleon's 100 days war actually lasted 111 days.

So even the metric based on a somewhat arbitrary tradition is itself inaccurate! Which leads us to the real reason we care about the first hundred days of a presidency so much: the number 100 is base 10, and therefore easy for our monkey brains to remember.

Fun fact: the gene that causes humans to have six fingers instead of five is dominant, not recessive. Which should make you ask: why don't we all have six fingers then? Selective breading, in short. The Church killed off anyone who they found with the six fingers, which of course forced them all to hide, and prevented those who died from passing on the gene and society to shun six-fingered people. I actually met someone who has the trait, but they didn't have the fingers. The doctors removed them when they were an infant so they'd grow up ""normal"". And he always maintained he hated that decision.

Anyway....

If history was just a little different, we all might have six fingers on each hand right now. And we'd have probably switched over to a base 12 counting system at some point along the way, as some other societies already used (Egyptians, Babylonians, and Chinese astronomers used duodecimal, from what I've read). We'd be talking about the first 144 days of the presidency instead++.

**There's nothing special about the number ""10"" except for the fact that we have ten fingers.**

And there's nothing special about a million dollars except for the fact that it's a multiple and exponent of ten, aka, the number of fingers us monkeys have. Any real concern for Bernie's wealth would be calculated as a percentage of the national wealth. And based on the number of millionaires that exist, I imagine his portion isn't especially significant. At least not any more significant than any other millionaire, which, as I discussed in my previous post, is demonstrative of the disease of wealth inequality and the failures of global capitalism. It's a symptom of a bigger disease. Not the cause of those diseases. 

Bernie's wealth is a lot. But how he earned it, what he does with it, and his ideas about how to govern are far more interesting and important (in varying degrees) than worrying about his identity as a ""millionaire"", or even the specific number of zeros in his bank account (numbers are all made up, anyway).

\++except, of course, in base twelve the number ""144"" is different. And we'd have to have created two extra numbers to create the base 12 system. So really, if we use letters for those numbers, as we do in hexadecimal (base 16 counting), we'd be talking about the first BB days of the presidency."

You're seriously my favorite interviewer of all time, and these interviews would be so boring without they way you drill into topics). And I think that was most obvious with the questions about Bernie's wealth.

Edit: This post got kinda long, but fuck it. If I can't get into the weeds with a reddit post about an episode of Ezra Klein's podcast, then what's the point in having nuanced opinions?

From my perspective, Nate is a bit more identity-based in his socialism, than I am. He described Buttigieg as not being of his tribe, effectively (I forget his exact wording). He said he couldn't be trusted because of how oblivious he was to the very real issues with his past employment.

And because of his identity-based socialism, he will always defend (up to a point, I'd hope) questionable actions/decisions/statements of one of his tribe. AKA Big Papa Bernie.

I don't defend Bernie's millionaire status in the same way he does. It's not that Bernie is a hypocrite and therefore he doesn't really believe in Socialism and we shouldn't listen to his ideas. The layers of essentializing and castrophizing to reach that conclusion is absurd. He's a millionaire because of how books sales work, and how he's become a celebrity politician. That's it. It's not some undercutting of his principles. He didn't deny human rights to achieve his wealth. JK Rowling became a fucking *billionaire* from selling books, and I don't hold that against her. Books sales are like, one of the most direct ways to exchange goods for money. There's far less room for abuse of workers because of how old this industry is.

Bernie's resulting identity as upper-class ipso facto his millions of dollars doesn't invalidate his socialist beliefs or ideas. And here's a complicated reason why:

Democrats misunderstand some of the core reasons that make billionaires bad for society. They are not just bad because of what they do with their unearned wealth (though, yeah, some of what they do is very bad IMO). They are a *symptom* of the disease of late stage capitalism. They are the *result* of bad economic principles. And attacking their identity as billionaires is a poor choice for Dems for a lot of reasons.

There's a fairly famous quote from RBG (cancer free as of 2020! Wooohooo) where she essentially says 'women won't truly be equal to men when the Supreme court is 50/50 men and women, but rather when the SC is entirely made up of women'. Lots of people (my younger self included) misunderstand that statement. She's not saying we should do what Justin Trudeau did with his cabinet and just make sure we're exactly 50% women for an election cycle. That's not the point. The fact that society so easily produced an all male SC decade after decade is symptomatic of the deeper gender-equality problems society has always had. So when we fix those problems, eventually and all-women SC will just happen. Naturally.

Now, I recognize that there's no such thing as truly ""natural"" when it comes to SC appointments. It's not like we're growing judges in nature. They're selected. I have no delusions about that. But her larger point rings true, to me. When an all female SC happens and it *isn't* big news, that's when we know we've overcome the deepest of our sexist tendencies in society.

And the same logic applies to billionaires. It's not their specific identity that's the problem (entirely). It's that our economic structures are built in such a way that these guys keep being created. This has become one of the clear indicators that our mechanisms for distributing wealth is lop-sided. So lop-sided that people need multiple jobs to maintain a state of living roughly equivalent with the previous generation (BTW US employment rates are misleading when considering the overall health of the economy).

So, for me, Bernie's millionaire status is a flaw in his identity, yes. But I just don't care about identity politics enough to care. Bernie's millionaire status isn't the plague that's strangling society. Deregulated capitalism is.
