He wanted out because of the situation, the hockey media played the usual story about ""locker room solidarity and cancer yadda yadda"", got traded for a damn low return and now he has a fucking Conn Smythe.

Then fans start to get hostile or in extreme cases not show up because if management doesn't are why should we? It's painful but reward people for doing shitty things then they will keep doing them that's basic human psychology.

We started tossing jerseys and booing the team collectively during the Eakins years in 2013-15 because it was just so clear management got complacent.  Something has to give in Buffalo."

hockey,ffy7zo7,t1_ffxttx8,1580340338.0,"MJ's behavior (lets put aside the pedophile accusations for now) really stems from his upbringing.

He was psychologically and emotionally damaged...that's what it stems from.  His father was abusive to an nth degree and forced him at a young age to perform lest he literally get belted.  Then after childhood he went into a solo career and became, at one point, the biggest solo musician in the world.  He never had a chance to either have a childhood or be able to self-reflect in adulthood as to ""why?"" to get a chance to recover.  He had a tilted, distorted and honestly broken view of the world that only made sense to him because of it.  Part of it resulted in him not understanding adults have barriers between them and children lest someone get the wrong idea and make accusations that are life ruining.

I'm talking ""meet me in my trailer"" level conflict that the studio had to mediate.  It was over creative differences with Rock allegedly intruding on what was Diesel (and the late Paul Walker's) passion project that got heated.  Whichever side one wishes to take is up to them but one cannot deny Rock gave the series a massive box office boost when it appeared to be sputtering.  But he overstayed his welcome in the end.

His character is still around but got spun off into the Hobbs & Shaw spinoff which was the middle ground.  Diesel gets to run his F&F series and Rock gets a spinoff he controls with the studio making more money in the end."
