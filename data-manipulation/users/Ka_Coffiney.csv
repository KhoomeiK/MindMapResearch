Futurology,fftj1hy,t1_fftioiv,1580221840.0,Ha! I don’t even watch football or follow Liverpool. It’s just a natural progression to be better through the use of technology. It’d be the same as questioning whether F1 teams using wind tunnels to make better designs is too far and they should just go off intuition.
Futurology,fftihbg,t1_fft8m2j,1580221426.0,"Kind of a weird statement at the end, that isn’t just wrong but also doesn’t seem relevant.

Lots of people like games of pure skill that have little tactics. Darts, golf, ten pin bowling, track & field. But team sports, even if the tactical aspect is ‘solved’ will revolve around assessing the opposing teams play and countering (chess like- NFL follows in this vein) and, most importantly, personal flair and skill."

DnD,feuw6ej,t1_fetrnes,1579390518.0,"Come on, if you’re a professional projection artist running visuals for EDM gigs you damn well know that this thing isn’t putting out 7,000 lumens. 7,000 lumens isn’t relatively pretty bright, it’s very bright and a mid-sized venue projector. You’d be lucky if this is even putting out 1,000 lumens. It’s not ANSI rated. A proper 7,000 lumen projector is at least a few grand new and wouldn’t have such a terrible native resolution.

There are heaps of these chinese projectors with lofty claims of 4K and high lumens on aliexpress, ebay and amazing and they’re all shite."

politics,fe5kkhp,t1_fe5gull,1578870612.0,"More articles of impeachment can be brought up and passed in the house to highlight more illegal activities, but without even attempting to remove him in the senate will be allowing them to do whatever they want in the election to ensure a win. Putting pressure on senate members to be on the record means being able to put pressure on them in their prospective races, leaving it in question allows them to dodge the question."
politics,fe5ed8c,t1_fe4ir3d,1578868340.0,"I don’t understand this argument. As stated in the hearings, one of the main reasons for the impeachment process is to remove an official who is looking to illegally influence their own re-election. 

Waiting until the election to try and gain more senate seats to pass it to the senate means going through the danger zone and hoping that voting beats the tsunami of illegal influence, hacking and slander. And if voting doesn’t win, impeachment is in an even worse position and Trump will essentially have carte blanche to do whatever crazy thing."

“Belief in Satan and the imminent return of Christ also helps explain the prime minister’s less-than-passionate response to the most pressing environmental issue of our time. It is not surprising that Pentecostal activism about climate change is non-existent – the end of the known world is not a matter for mere mortals to decide. When Morrison proudly showed off a piece of coal in parliament, there is no reason to doubt that he believed what he held in his hand was a gift from God.

It is also likely that Morrison has a level of scepticism about empirical science in general. One of the core doctrines of the ACC is that “all original life forms, including humanity, were made by the specific immediate creative acts of God … and that all biological changes which have occurred since creation are limited to variation within species”. In other words, humans and other animals were created by God in their essential form. If Morrison does not believe this, it should be easy enough to say so.”

“According to Pentecostal theology, all of history – and the future – is in the control of God; from creation, to the Fall of humanity in the Garden of Eden, to the redemption of all in the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ. In turn, this will lead to the second coming of Christ, the end of the world and the final judgement.

This is why further action on reducing carbon emissions to counter the environmental damage wrought by climate change may have little intellectual purchase with the PM. If the end of the world through climate change is part of God’s providential plan, there is precious little that we need to or can do about it.”
