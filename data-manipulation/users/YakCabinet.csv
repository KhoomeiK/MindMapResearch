I’m glad it’s a fox."

Regardless, I can tell we’re not going to see eye to eye on this, so can only suggest you discuss this within your professional circle, bone up on your canine behaviour, and try to do better for the dogs in your care."
MadeMeSmile,ff4we3s,t1_ff4txf3,1579574047.0,"I wholeheartedly disagree with your assessment. I thought it was cute for a sec, but the more I watched it the more I realized this pup isn’t at all happy. Look at videos of dogs actually playing—in water, or just in general—and you’ll see a huge difference, handicapped or not. 

A few things seem to be preventing the dog from escaping in this case: one, the dog is instinctively trying to leap, but failing because his hind limbs are paralyzed and is as a result bringing his front paws back down repeatedly to support his weight. Two, the dog’s positioning within the container appears to be hindering his ability to lift his paws completely upright without first turning his body to have more room (which he’s not doing because he’s panicked).

There’s a moment near the beginning of the of the vid where we can see the little guy lurch to the side and look down, which looks like a clear attempt to leap out, only his legs fail him so he can’t. The rim of the tub is also quite high.

The most telling thing that the dog is distressed is that there’s cuts in the video that show the tub at different water levels, and throughout the whole thing, the dog’s behaviour is non-stop and unvarying. Happy dogs don’t do this. Happy dogs pause and enjoy life, even if for a brief moment.

I reeeeally wanted to look at this and go “aww” but I’m afraid it’s just not tippy taps. Unless panic tippy taps are a thing we’re embracing here, then yeah, absolutely it’s tippy taps."

MadeMeSmile,ff3tnlj,t1_ff2h55r,1579548606.0,"I don’t think anyone is debating whether paralyzed dogs also need baths; pretty sure we can all agree that every dog should get proper care.

What is debatable, however, is whether this dog is happy or excited and therefore tippy tappin’, as its existence in this sub would suggest. Its body language suggests not.

Edit: grammar."
tippytaps,ff2jrdw,t1_ff2jgzk,1579509301.0,I really do wish this were the case. Sorry :/
tippytaps,ff2jgfx,t1_ff2i31n,1579508891.0,"I’d wondered the same thing but think we don’t see this for two reasons: one, because he’s instinctively trying to propel with his hind legs but getting no traction cuz he’s paralyzed so repeatedly needs his front paws to come back down to support his weight, and two, he’s in an awkward position within the tub. 

He doesn’t appear to actually have enough room to fully lift his front legs from where he is in that container without first turning his body. If he were calmer he’d likely be able to figure it out (also if his hind legs worked), but I do think it’s clear the lil’ dude is struggling. 

There’s a moment near the beginning where we see him turn towards the side as though to leap, only he doesn’t cuz his legs won’t cooperate. The video also cuts to show the bucket full of water (it’s only slightly full at the beginning), and the dog is still engaged in the exact same behaviour, in the exact same spot. That to me reads as stress. 

Playful, happy dogs take little breaks to appreciate how heckin good life is. They wag. They move around. They make those big, stupid, blissful smiley faces where their tongue hangs out. This pup is just stuck."
tippytaps,ff2f756,t3_er65d5,1579503603.0,Sorry to say I’m pretty sure this pup’s hind legs are paralyzed and he’s struggling to get out. :c
MadeMeSmile,ff2eujq,t1_ff1ocuc,1579503205.0,"Yeah this doesn’t look right. Thought it was cute for a moment, but the longer I watched the more it seemed off. 

The position and lack of movement of the hind legs and the panting/overall expression doesn’t read happy dog to me. I think the poor pup is distressed. :<"
