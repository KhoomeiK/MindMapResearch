Do you have to wear uniforms?"

Made me seriously reconsider having kids ever.  Those people’s entire worlds became child centric.  I’m not really that interested in that"

unpopularopinion,fd2udlo,t1_fd2kn0r,1578151761.0,"Fair, but if the expectation is for teachers to be judges, therapists (yes, kids do come up to them when they’re having issues) and teachers. They either need to be better compensated for their time, they need to be better staffed or (and in my opinion for this to truly work) both.  

I also think you’re overestimating most kid’s ability/desire to focus.  While I agree that in concept, that’s a more important lesson in life, unfortunately, I can’t imagine that the kids would be paying too much attention.  While the teacher sorts all this out, there will be a bunch of other chaotic shit that 90% of the students will be focused on.  

I agree, in a more perfect world, where teachers don’t have to worry about getting their kids up to standardized test levels, and all the other shit they have to, this is a better solution.  I just don’t think it’ll a realistic idea"
childfree,fd2f4wa,t3_ejt1tc,1578146316.0,"I work in schools.  I wholeheartedly agree and I also think many of my colleagues would also agree.  


Had a co-worker (at another job) adopt their foster daughter and was talking about the classes and test they had to take to adopt her. I brought up how, even though I know it’s not feasible I would love it if everyone who wanted to have a kid, at least had to take a class (cause honestly, a lot of parents seem to suck).  Another co-owner, got annoyed and said that wasn’t fair and it would prevent people from having kids.  Everyone hanged up on that person (another one of my coworkers works in schools and she saw first hand how much shitty parents fuck their kids up)

Anyways, I don’t think it’s as unpopular as you might think"
unpopularopinion,fd0f4bb,t3_ejndth,1578117910.0,"While I agree, I have a bit of perspective from the other side of this.  

When teaching in a classroom, there’s about 15,000 things you need to be attending to.  You have a lesson to teach, a bunch of other kids who aren’t involved in the conflict, etc.  Stopping an entire class to try and figure out who started whatever when down is not realistic because each student will have their own perspective on what happened. 

Saying “it doesn’t matter who started it” is much more about getting the class back on track without continuing the disruption than anything else"

AskReddit,fcnlnjp,t3_ehxokw,1577813877.0,"TL;DR the worst thing to do is curse out a cop for making you spill your beer and then chuck your empty beer at him.


Story time! Don’t know how true it is because it’s third hand but it’s hilarious to picture.

My best friends dad was a fucking nutcase when he was younger.  He went to school out in Arizona in the 70s.  His buddies and him would pass time by getting absolutely shitfaced in the deserts and mountains.  

One day during their expeditions, they were blasting an old Jeep on a mountain road.  It was little more than a single lane, dirt paths that cling to the side of a mountain.  Being in their early 20s and drunk they decided to see just how fast they could take the hairpin turns while pounding beers.  

My friend’s dad (we’ll call him Tim) was in the passenger seat and his friend (let’s say his name is Dan) was driving.  They took a hairpin, freshly opened beers in hand when the road opened up some to see a cop driving straight at them.  Dan slams the brakes, the truck skids and almost tips off the side of the mountain as his beer slips from his hand.  Two cops gets out of their car and had over but before they can reach the jeep Dan gets out of the truck yells, “what the fuck you son of a bitch! You made me spill my beer” and he chucks the empty at the nearest cop.  The cops just put their hands on their foreheads wonder what the fuck is happening and give them a warning."
