Your last statement is subjective because people feel differently about group prayer depending on the group that is praying and their own cultural and spiritual beliefs. For me, it would definitely feel hostile."
atheism,fenzu4l,t1_fenns47,1579293152.0,"I get were you are coming from with that statement. Everyone needs to have basic rights respected. You are absolutely correct there.

The problem that I see when it comes to large group prayers in schools is in the intersectionality of rights. 

What do I mean by that? isn't a persons rights black and white? Well let's have some other more extreme versions of this issue.

Like when we restrict the right of one person to own slaves, or restrict the right of a husband to beat his wife. These are (far more severe) cases where we have decided that one person doesn't have a right to infringe on the rights of others. 

That is the same vein I am seeing this issue following. Can kids pray in school? Of course! Can they hold large prayer groups in public spaces where everyone is subjected to their prayers? No. Because it is not okay to turn public schools into hostile environments for minorities. 

You can of course have a different opinion Mz. Shitsindiaper, but it would be helpful if you would explain it."

atheism,fen0vw9,t1_femxd64,1579274476.0,"The thing that gets me nervous is that this opens the door to pointing out the religious minority students by kids calling prayer time and then shunning those who don't join in. Kids can be so nasty to anyone who is different. 

Now, that said I would love to see the reaction to the public prayers lead by the after school Satan club. Still, I'd rather kids just focus on school while at school."
