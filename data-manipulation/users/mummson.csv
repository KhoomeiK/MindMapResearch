It’s not perfect I have to swap out the connectors soon I somehow messed them up and it can be hard to plug them in. I think I’ll end up using XT90 and I have to make a better bracket for the PSU."

PS4,feqqqhl,t3_eqamco,1579344998.0,"I have spent way too much money on custom controllers, bought the nacon back when it came out and the PROPRIETARY usb cable got damaged after a few months and had to wait too long for a replacement (the first gen had a proprietary cable, they later changed to a usb-c I think) but at that time I was just pissed off and never really liked the controller. 

I then tried a diy kit off eBay, it was ok but I had issues with the buttons getting loose on the inside of the DS4. 

After that I went all out and bought a tricked out scuf impact which was extremely expensive. It works fine but I was never happy with the build quality of it, still use it for FPS games. 

That being said I am really interested in trying out this add on and hope that it works out well.

TL;DR
I have never been 100% satisfied with the custom controllers and can’t wait to get my hands on the DS4 back button attachment."
