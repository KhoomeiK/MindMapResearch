succulents,ffiysuw,t3_etshr6,1579986062.0,I think I read once about using actual eggshells as planters because of the nutrients they provide upon decomposing. Thoughts?

Fitness,ffeqptz,t3_et5gip,1579860787.0,Sleep. Rest & recovery is as important as the workout.

actuallesbians,ffbtrhf,t3_erpaye,1579782447.0,"You're not looking for The One, so relax. It won't be perfect, but it'll be an experience. Have as wide a variety of life experiences as you can. Be brave, and be patient."
actuallesbians,ffbtoqi,t3_err115,1579782367.0,"I love her because she sees all of me, the best and the very worst of me, and she loves all of it. She complements me; where I lack, she is abundant. She's highly intelligent, self-aware, caring, and brave. Making her smile and laugh is worth more to me than awards and accolades and gold medals. I don't feel tied to her; I feel free."
actuallesbians,ffbtdfu,t3_es0sdn,1579782038.0,Almost none. But I'm still valid.
actuallesbians,ffbtbg6,t3_es4xmx,1579781983.0,"Politely and kindly, but firmly. Do it in person, and know when to stop talking and walk away."
actuallesbians,ffbta4r,t3_es0wtc,1579781946.0,"If you feel safe (unsafe and nervous are not the same), tell her. It could be better than you'd ever dreamed."
actuallesbians,ffbt7ju,t3_es2zh0,1579781870.0,"Constant communication, and being secure in yourself, always leads to good things. Make a mistake? Whoops, try again. Tried something but found out you don't like it? Don't do it again. Not sure where to go / what to do? Ask. Be brave, and be patient. Rome, she was not built in a day. You'll be fine."

actuallesbians,ffbsoiv,t3_eshy89,1579781282.0,What goes well with bread? Maybe a nice jar of jam / preserves? Stick a pretty ribbon on it and you two are halfway to a picnic!
actuallesbians,ffbsm65,t3_esjvpm,1579781207.0,"She's a person. Talk to her like a person. Outfit compliments are for people you don't know very well, and you say you've known this girl for awhile. What's she interested in? Does she doodle in her notebooks? Does she have a cool phone case? Is she funny? Did she make an interesting insight in class? Do you need help on your homework, or a de-stress from college applications? Want to go see that new movie? My sister is in the market for a pair of combat boots and I told her I'd ask you for your recommendations. You're hungry; invite her to grab a snack. Whatever! Compliments mean your conversation is dead in the water unless there's an opportunity to continue."
actuallesbians,ffbsa65,t3_espaby,1579780824.0,"First time for everything; you won't know what you think of something (butter pecan ice cream, skateboarding, dating girls, whatever) until you try it. Be brave, and be patient. Good luck."
actuallesbians,ffbs6xx,t3_esnr4q,1579780720.0,No. How could there be a lesbian accent when lesbians speak all the languages of the world?
actuallesbians,ffbs5r7,t3_esonu5,1579780679.0,Never heard of this
actuallesbians,ffbs49x,t3_eso0s4,1579780630.0,"Storytime: I wanted an undercut / partly shaved style for a long time because I present feminine and wanted to identify myself to the community on first glance. I bought flannels and experimented with wearing ties / more masculine clothing because I wanted to signal to others. I was scared about passing / hiding, and didn't feel part of the community enough because I presented so straight (and all of the problematic privilege that comes along with that). Honestly, none of those things are really ""me"", and none of them make you more lesbian or bisexual. If you want to know someone's orientation, ask them. If someone makes a mistake about your orientation, gently and cheerfully correct them. You are who you are; you're not any less valid for looking how you want to look."
actuallesbians,ffbrlui,t3_esrgdk,1579780021.0,"Woo yes! Keep going! Try for a rejection every week, or if that's too tough, every other week! Totally serious here; there's a TED talk some guy gave about overcoming fear of rejection (can't think of the name right now) and eventually, not only do you get comfortable with both the idea of rejection and yourself, but your actual rate of rejection goes way down. Turn this into a game; you'll have way more fun with it."

actuallesbians,fel5wcz,t3_epihiz,1579214735.0,"I think realizing you’re bi is the hardest because if you do have that attraction to the gender society tells you you’re supposed to be attracted to, it can be hard to really listen to your inner self and be true to who you really are. It might be buried under so many layers that it takes awhile to really discover. You are never late to your own life. Be patient, and trust your gut. You’ll be okay."

Take things at your own pace; if you like something or someone, keep going. If you don’t, stop. Keep it simple."
