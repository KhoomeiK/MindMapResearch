If you want to take religion out of the picture, you can swap my examples for their non-religious counterparts. Instead of a church, take a temple. Instead of a preacher, take somebody that talks about God and not religion. Instead of scriptures, take some text about God that is void of religion (Tao Te Ching would be a good example). 

It's not just because you're tripping, there are other factors. It has happened a few times though, and it is nothing short of profound. No tricks, either. I've had conversations where neither of us opened our mouths. They were just as amazed as I was. Many others have experienced this phenomenon. 

That isn't true, there is a replication crisis which I'm sure you're aware of- many accepted studies aren't repeatable. They are testable though, so you're right about that.

Okay, I'll give it a shot. This method will give you a glimpse. If you know what you're looking for, there is a very high probability of success. First, you're going to watch that video I sent you, all the way through. At least until you understand what is meant, and your only qualm is that you haven't verified any of it for yourself. You have to know what you're looking for. Next, acquire some DMT. 5meo will probably work better for this purpose, but it can be achieved with N,N as well. It's recommended to extract it yourself, but if you don't plan on using it often then you could just buy some online. [hpfromtj.com](https://hpfromtj.com) gives out 'free samples' if you pay for shipping. It's a religious product for Terra Joulle, so it is legal to ship. The easiest simple ingestion method would be to buy a Glass Vapor Genie, but you can make a machine to do it if you don't want to drop the cash. Next, go ahead and empty your mind. Just meditate for a few minutes, if you're having trouble with that, then just follow your breath. Take deep breaths to oxygenate your lungs. Vape the DMT, go slow at first and then suck it all in. Hold it for at least 15 seconds. Once you're in, question your existence and/or the existence of God. If you follow all of this, you will have undeniable proof that God exists. You won't be able to share it with anybody, because it is via direct experience and you can't share that. But, you will know, and the matter of the existence of God will be settled once and for all. Might seem like a lot of work, but after all is said and done it's about 3 hours of your life and $5, to put an end to a seemingly endless question (that's a bit of a lie, the question doesn't disappear it just changes from 'does god exist' to something else). Course psychedelics carry an inherent risk, but if you respect the substance, it will respect you. If you go in with this intent, you will not be punished for it. 

You don't need to take drugs to experience God, it is just a shortcut. Else, you can work on heightening your consciousness. You might have a problem with this because science can't explain consciousness literally at all, but if you start on the path you will realize how it's done. Self discipline, concentration/focus meditation, sensory retreats, similar things. It may take years to get to the right level. But once you're there, you won't need any advice from me because you'll be quite beyond me.

Here's the thing, people generally do not give a fuck about God. Even religious folk, they don't really care. They just want to think they're doing the right thing and feel like they're good people, it has nothing to do with God. So you rarely see it. If you grew up in a rainforest, you probably wouldn't think much about science. You probably wouldn't encounter people doing it too often. It would be easy to write off the ideas of a supercomputer in your pocket as fantasy. Just as it is easy for you and me to write off the idea that somebody meditated by a tree for 10 months straight without food or water. I'm not saying I believe this, I'm saying it's easy to write off, because we haven't experience anything like that. If you want to get a little closer to what you're questioning, take a trip to America and see all the technology for yourself. You won't understand how it works, but you can see that it's there. Go on an ayahuasca retreat, and witness others experiencing God. Many of them might have started as atheists, but I reckon little to none will leave that way. You can ask them why. You can read some [Reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ayahuasca/comments/8zbuwr/an_atheist_experiences_god/) about people that have had this experience.

What you'll see is that those claiming to have experienced God will say almost exactly the same thing of it, regardless of their previous notions of God. The experiences corroborate each other. 

I want to be clear that taking drugs is not the only way to experience God; again, it is just a shortcut. Not all of my divine experiences have been through drugs. The latest was in the middle of Spinoza. I was considering something that was written and this pondering led me to experience. Drugs are a much more 'scientific' way of doing it though, because it's repeatable, testable, and simple. Without drugs, it is anything but. It's also not specific to one drug, my first experience of God was not with DMT but LSD. DMT seems much more efficient and sending you there, though.

If you have any questions about the experiment I've proposed, please ask. I don't think you'll actually do it, but now you have an option to prove me wrong. If you're skeptical about buying it online, I can send you some I've extracted (and tested ;) myself for free."

You shouldn't ever trust someone 100%. That makes you naive. Even if you've been married for 50 years, you shouldn't trust that person 100%. You shouldn't even trust yourself 100%, being disilluded is so very easy.

AskReddit,fdcwg1k,t1_fdcmuya,1578286303.0,"That's a good thing, believe it or not. If you always feel like you're failing, but desperately want to succeed, do you know what you will do? You will keep trying new things. You will put way too much effort into raising good children, because you're so terrified of failure. You are basically sacrificing yourself, for the betterment of your children. Don't let it get out of hand (spiraling = bad), but a healthy dose of 'feeling like a failure' for you means a good future for your kids. Don't ask me how I know that, but I do.

I'll share an example. I have experienced my mom crying many times. Some of which, I'm certain it's because she felt she didn't/hasn't done enough for us. We grew up without a dad, lived with my grandma at first, then a 3BR apartment for the 6 of us (I have 4 siblings). Sometimes we would go to bed a little hungry. It wasn't unbearable, and there was often food to eat but us being just kids, didn't always know what to make of it. We had a babysitter when we were real young, but after some time my older sister would 'babysit' us. We had some entertainment, never anything new. We had clothes and shoes to wear, almost exclusively from Goodwill and often worn down with time. Anyway, I can't say any of this in particular made her feel a certain way, but I know that she struggled with the fact that we were broke, and stuff like that.

Here's the thing, though. All of these hardships, have shaped me into somebody that is currently very happy with life, and excited for his future. The lack of a father gave me empathy for others. The world is a bit different if you don't have a father figure in your life, and I can understand this. You can't understand it if you don't experience it. You can know that it's different, but you will never understand what that is like. When I moved out at 18, I knew how to cook budget-friendly nutritious meals for myself. That might not come so easy if you didn't have to cook for yourself as a child, or if you had frozen dinners and whatnot. We had staple ingredients, and I learned how to use them. Not that others can't do that, but I didn't have to try, it was something I needed to do and it has just stuck. Since my mom was often at work, I had a ton of freedom. I made a decent amount of mistakes, and learned a lot from doing so. The apartment we had was for low-income families, so there were always other kids to play with. This resulted in me trying weed at age 11, and using it daily at age 15. Started experimenting with psychedelics around 16. But, it turns out that I actually really like drugs and I've stuck with the safe ones. They have helped shape me into the beautiful person I am today. Without a new Xbox every year, I had to learn how to enjoy life without having expensive things, and without spending a lot of money. That too, has stuck. I had fun by accidentally exercising. Riding my bike, playing tag, climbing trees. 10 years later, I still absolutely love riding my bike and climbing (among other things), I'm very glad that I learned to enjoy those things. Considering there wasn't an influx of new clothes, I had to learn how to sew if I didn't want holes in my clothes. Even though I could totally afford new clothes, I still sew them up if they're torn instead of throwing them away. I'm far from perfect, and not every bad thing is a good thing in disguise, I've just given some examples of things that worked out for the better IMO.

This isn't just some sort of humble-brag. What I'm saying is that even if you feel like you're failing as a parent, all of your failures could turn out to be instrumental to your childrens' success. Children are sponges. If they see you trying, they will learn to try. If they see you persevere in the face of hardship, they will learn to do the same. If they see you admit when you're wrong, they will do it without needing to think about saving face. But see, you can't admit that you're wrong if you're never wrong. You can't persevere if you aren't miserable. You can't try if you don't need to. Of course none of these are *exactly* true, but I think you get the message. Don't be so hard on yourself. Just by trying to be a good parent, you are being a good parent, whether or not you realize that. There is very little that you can do wrong with this mindset, even if almost everything you do is incorrect. Realize this, allow some extra love for yourself if you need to. Then, forget it. Lose this message, because it won't help you be a good parent, just a snob if you cling to it. You need to keep suffering for a bit, if you want your efforts to be fruitful.

Parents who think they're the best parents in the world, are often the worst. I mean, how would you feel if you were the one that raised Donald Trump? Do you think Fred ever felt like a failure? Probably not. He probably thought he was doing a great job. He's great at business, so he must be great at everything. Failures are the child's fault, because you are perfect. I think we're all aware of the result of this type of parenting. Absorb your childrens' downfalls; keep being spongy. 

Peace and love."

But, your God exists too, and now I want you to prove that your God exists. Use what you follow, if you follow intuition, I want you to prove that intuition exists. If you follow science, I want you to prove that science exists. It's not a reasonable request, do it anyway. That's what we're doing here. I'm dealing with unreasonable requests, and so are you. I can't prove my God exists, mundanely or not, yet you want me to do just that. That's an unreasonable request. Another unreasonable request is me expecting you to believe something that isn't proven. But we do that all the time, so I want you to make an exception. Science is not proven, not to me right now it isn't. There is evidence of its success, but it's not proven.

atheism,fd4r71h,t1_fd43e2t,1578170287.0,"I'd like to address some of your concerns. I'll preface this by saying when I first watched the video, I had a similar experience. I wasn't ready for it, and I didn't finish the video. 

You're correct regarding his assertion- God is an experience. It isn't just an experience, it is **the** experience. When he says something like the experience of God, he means an experience when you're aware that you are God.

The proof is in the pudding. The proof is too mundane for you to accept, that's why there are smoke and mirrors. If you understand the question you're asking, you'll realize it is the same as asking ""Am I asking a question?"" The reply is inconsequential. If you understand the question, you don't need an answer. I'll say for nth time, the proof of God is the fact that you experience. The fact that anything exists. There is a simple and mundane proof for you right there, but you aren't ready to accept it, because you don't know what God means.

This is correct. I believe that he has direct experience with God, based on what he is saying and the fact that I too have direct experience with God, and my experience is correlative. Of course, this is a seemingly ridiculous claim, and that's why he asks you to verify it for yourself, so you don't need any faith. The only faith I have is faith in me. Not that everything I think or say is correct (in fact most of it is probably incorrect), but that I am. That's what I have faith in, and it's the only faith necessary.

Dude. You're missing the entire point. It's very easy to ""prove"" that you exist, by simply saying ""hi, I exist"". But this isn't PROOF, it is evidence. You cannot prove that you exist to someone else, for they could simply be having a dream. There is ample evidence of God- it has been written about since written language has existed. Many different accounts claim similar features and facets of God. There are temples dedicated to it. It will literally tell you ""I am God."" If you want evidence, there is plenty. Evidence is easy to discard, because it isn't proof. There is evidence that you can fly, via some dreams you may have had. This is why proof is important. Evidence is misleading. There is proof of God, but you can only prove it for yourself, you cannot prove it to someone else- just like you can prove that you exist for yourself, but you cannot prove it to others. You can only show them evidence and hope they get the message. I think some good evidence of God is the fact that others claim to have proved its existence for themselves. Of course this isn't proof, but it is pretty good evidence. Have you proof that atoms exist? Or do you just accept evidence as proof? I'm going to assume the latter. This doesn't work with God. If you want to understand it, you need to prove it for yourself. You need to buy a microscope and see the structure of the atom before you, before you accept its existence. The beautiful thing is, you don't need any sort of explanation or description when you see it. You can just point to it and say ""that is an atom, because I am defining whatever this is, as an atom"". When you see that others have done similar things, you can compare notes. Do you see what they saw? Are your implications the same? Do you have the same label for it? The evidence is only realized after the proof. See when you're suggesting ""proving"" your existence by shaking someone's hand, you're already assuming that you exist. You already have proof, that's the only reason that you can submit evidence. If you didn't have proof that you exist, no evidence would be able to prove to you that you exist. So when you say that you don't want proof, but mundane evidence, it's frustrating. There is plenty of mundane evidence that I have submitted to you, but none of it is good enough. And none of it will be, until you have proof. 

Here's an exercise for you. Forget others, prove to yourself that thoughts exist. Now tell me how you did it. Is there any way around it, other than thinking? I don't think there's another way to prove it. If that is so, it's a great analogy for God. You cannot prove that God exists, apart from doing it. To prove that thoughts exist, you must be aware that you are thinking. To prove that you exist, you must be aware that you exist. To prove that God exists, you must be aware that you are God. The proof is utterly circular, if you're not aware that you exist, you won't be able to prove it. But once you're aware that you exist, you don't even need to prove it. Yet, you could, by doing literally anything. Everything and anything is proof if taken in the right light. A leaf blowing in the wind is proof that you exist, so long as you're aware of it.

If you don't want to continue that's fine. As I've said before, you don't need to be aware of God to be a good person or lead a good life (that's my opinion anyway, others' differ). But do me a favor, and question why. Why would he spend hours creating a video if he just wants to trick people? Couldn't that be done in a thirty minute video? What's the gain for him, anyway? What's the gain for me, here? To trick some random internet person into thinking I'm profound? Or am I just afraid of the unknown, so I pretend that I know it, and this expulsion of reason is just a result? Wouldn't both of those be easier and more fruitful by going on a theist subreddit? Or speaking to a dolt? Maybe I'm just stupid, and didn't realize that beforehand. Or maybe, I'm trying to show you something, and you won't take off your blindfold. Just take a peek, dude. Try to do it. Try to be God, so you can see for yourself. I know it's difficult when the belief isn't there- do it out of disbelief. There's no danger, apart from maybe feeling foolish if you fail. Or feeling foolish for asking me ""how would I do that?"". Wasting a little more of your time, I guess. As if this entire life of ours isn't just a waste of time. No animosity there, just a factoid. What do you have to lose? If you don't find the proof you need, your views won't change, you won't be tricked into this mystical woowoo."

>obeys uniform laws that are predicable

They are only predictable to an extent. You cannot predict anything past a certain point of depth, I'm sure you know this.

>But energy is not a thing. It’s a measure of potential work. It’s something the star *has*, not something it is.

Energy is a thing, it is a measure of work. It's what the star has, it's what the star is. In case you don't remember, E=mc\^2. That means that mass multiplied by a constant is energy. Each atom that composes the star, is purely energy, a mix of both kinetic and potential energy (because energy is not just potential). 

>This is a really convoluted way to saying that you need to exist in order to be involved in some process

No, it's a convoluted way to say that you create your experience. Your brain does, and if you identify that as a part of yourself, then you do. A builder creates a building, not the bricks he uses.

>But Sally is not a precondition to my having a party

Ah, the 'ol switcheroo. Sally is definitely a precondition to having the surprise party that Sally threw, I don't care about any old party you throw. 

>We need only look at the nature of our experience. It is uniform and cares not one iota about our feelings or desires.

That's a bold claim, considering your experience will be intense, relaxed, joyful, etc, based on your feelings and desires. This is to say your experience utterly changes based on your feelings and desires. If you desire cake, and you see cake, this will be a different experience than if you don't desire cake but have the same image. It isn't uniform, it is dynamic. Your experience doesn't necessarily care, but it does change based on different inputs. Without this fact, your experience would be static. 

>It’s public (shared between people) and so forth.

You really think that your dreams are shared between others? Your experience isn't public. If you want to talk about the external world, call it that. The external world is not what you experience. You experience sight, sound, thought, etc. You experience perception of things, not things in themselves. It's true that your perception of things often coincides with others. More often than that, though, it doesn't. I'm not saying an external world doesn't exist, I'm saying it doesn't exactly coincide with your experience. This is why people with jauntice see everything in a yellow hue. Does that mean that everything is a yellow hue? Of course not. That's just their experience. No, it isn't public or shared.

>Energy is not a thing and it’s quite defiantly not the source of all things. 

Energy definitely is a thing, we have defined it to be so. It may not be the origin, but it is a source of all things. A river flowing may not be the origin of the water, but it is a source of it. Everything physical requires energy to exist or do anything.

>We’re going in circles because you’re not presenting a clear and coherent argument

That's probably true. My point is too, though. You're not actually considering what I'm saying. You're supposed to use my words as food for thought. Fake some faith so you can understand where this is coming from. Feel free to throw it away after. What's going on here is I'm trying to tell you about pi, and you just keep trying to prove that circles can't exist. It doesn't matter, consider it anyway. Once you understand, you can go back to disputing the existence of circles. It's beside the damn point.

I've jumped through a lot of hoops to try to help you, you can just continue being athiest or whatever it is that you are.

2. If you're watching a film, it is true that you did not create the film. But, it is also true that you could not watch a film without your brain turning sensory inputs into vision and sound. You are the one creating the vision and sound, in your brain. It's true that someone else gave you the input, but without the process of you, there is no output. Preconditions can be called causes. Otherwise, the word cause has no meaning. I could knock over a tower and cause it to fall, but this is only true because of the preconditions I created for the building, which were caused by the preconditions inside of me. Without preconditions, you can't call anything a cause.
3. You're correct, I didn't read it. I will try to give it a go when I have the time, which won't be 'till tonight or tomorrow. My argument for this point was that nothing can happen without being created. We do not live in an objective reality- at least, we would have no way of knowing. Because we are subjects, who perceive colors, sound, sight, etc. Not everything does that, and some things do more than that. So, which of these is objective? All you know is sight, sound, thoughts, etc, and all of these vary by subject. None are objective.

&#x200B;

That's why we're going around in circles, arguing about semantics, and trying to pick apart each others arguments. Because we're both missing the point. 

Don't take my word for it, find it out yourself. Since you've suggested a reading, I'll suggest one of my own. It's called the Tao Te Ching, perhaps you're familiar. This, coupled with a good friend, is what pushed me from atheism, to general theism, to pantheism, which is where I'd say I currently reside. Good luck, the journey is convoluted and bears no fruit.

God is just one thing. The ""things"" are just different explanations or understandings of the same one thing. Like the God of christianity is also Allah of Islam, they are explained differently but in essence they are the same thing.

My definition is 'creator of all'. Depending on your beliefs, ""all"" could mean a lot of different things. You see, you can't really prove that stars and galaxies exist. What if this is all just a dream? In any case, you can prove that you exist, because to have the capacity to question existence, you must exist. So, if you don't believe a whole lot, 'all' could just mean 'you'. If you think that sexual reproduction created you, that would make sexual reproduction God. This is assuming that you are all there is, and that there is nothing beyond sexual reproduction. Both of these things are probably false, so you can throw this definition away. I only created it to show you how you can define God for yourself. No matter what your beliefs, there is God. The only thing that changes is your definition of it. Really, your understanding of it. God means 'creator of all', but that isn't all that it means. The creator of all has attributes in and of itself- what are they? Find that out, and you can create new definitions for God.

atheism,fcvr2at,t1_fcvcsnm,1578008176.0,"Because Jacob believes its the author of its experience, it is. You see, there is just experience, and Jacob didn't create this. But, Jacob's experience is created by Jacob, because it is Jacob's experience. Without Jacob, it is just experience. With Jacob, it is Jacob's experience. Jacob creates its experience, because it attaches an identity to plain experience. Without this attachment of identity, this could not be certain. With it, it is certain that Jacob's experience is created by Jacob. You can prove this by removing Jacob: then Jacob's experience will not exist, because Jacob creates it. Jacob creates its experience in its mind, it is the output of sensory inputs and other activity. If this is too convoluted, just forget it.

My demonstration to you, regarding proof of God, is existence. Existence is happening, which means it is being created. If something is not being created, it is not happening. There's no other way around that. Disprove this by telling me something that is happening, without being created. Nothing happens without being created. Even a spec of dust blowing in the wind, this happening is being created by the blowing of wind and a spec of dust, and by us thinking about it. The existence of uncertainty doesn't negate determinism. Sure, you cannot be certain of things that will happen. But, you can be certain of things that have happened, things that are happening. You can't determine the exact path of a photon, but you can be certain that the photon will have a path. We don't have infinite scope, but we do have a narrow slice. Take any event, and you can figure out the reason behind it, for your own subjective experience. You can confirm it with numbers and physical laws. 

I think the best proof of God is that existence didn't happen, but rather it is happening, currently. If it happened, it could be disputed like everything else. You can't dispute something that is happening, though. It is happening, it is being created. If a tree falls and nobody's around to hear it, it only makes a sound if you imagine that it does. Regardless of whether or not the tree is real, the sound is if you hear it.

I am the creator of my existence. My body is a part of me, and it is the one that is typing right now, which is what my existence is to you, words on a screen. I am not a person, I is a word on a screen that you've read. This existence of mine is being created by me (words on a screen), and by you. In this moment, we are both God, because we are both creators of existence. Call it erroneous, that is the truth. It isn't the whole truth, but it is nothing but the truth. What's riveting is that it's all imaginary. I am not real, I am a figment of your imagination. How do I know? Because you can't sense me, I am not present to you. Again, I am not a person. Not right now, anyway. Right now I'm just words, and you've created a person from them in your imagination. Swear all you want, I am not real. You've created me. Without you, I don't exist! You are God. Fight it as you will, that's what you're here on earth to do. Forget that you're God. in order to be partial, and experience. 

Regardless of all this reason, I don't think that I can make you learn God. Hopefully I've helped, but the only true learning is internal. Frankly, you've already learned a lot, you just don't know what it is yet. I've just recited a poem, and you've listened intently. Once you learn what the words mean, you will understand what the poem means. When it clicks, you will get it. You will know the synchronicity. Some day, my friend, you will experience divinity.

Jacob's experience is all that is certain, the creator of all that is certain is Jacob, Jacob is God. Certainly, this is the truth.

However, it is true that not all is certain, and apparently we don't live in a certain world. I've come to a conclusion, and I think with this you will agree. I cannot prove to you that God exists, because I can't even prove to you that you exist. But, I do think that if you can be certain of something, you can be certain of other things via the channel of reason. All said and done, I'm certain that I exist, and I am certain that God exists. But, I can't prove either of those things to you. Regardless, I will leave you with this fact, that I have discovered. **If you can be certain that you exist, you can be certain that God exists.**"

I did make a reply to your comment before you deleted it, I will just post it below. A bit lazy, I know. But, I think I got around the circular argument, so maybe this plunge will bear some fruit.

>You can define a concept any way you choose

That isn't exactly what I mean. You can't define a cat to be a horse, but you can define a cat to be a feline, or a house-cat, a Caterpillar machine, etc. You see, there's one label for an array of meanings. This is why I gave the example of 'dad', there are different ways you can take the word. You can define a concept in different ways, so long as they make sense. God means creator, and from that I've attached other definitions to the word based on implications I think that has. Ignore this, and let's just stick with the definition of ""creator of all"".

I agree it's very important to be on the same page, that's why I've written all of this. Not to say that I can call whatever I want God, but to say that if we're on the same page, you will agree that it is impossible for God not to exist. See, even if tiger and house cat are both valid examples of a cat, we can't have a conversation about cat unless we agree on the definition.

I don't want to backtrack, so I'll submit that what I said was incorrect. But, perhaps we can move forward regardless.

I do believe that God is the totality of things. But, that isn't where I want to start, that is just proof that God exists if you accept that definition. What I do think could progress our mutual understanding, is bridging the gap between that definition, and the one you're familiar with.

God is the creator of all that is. I think this much, we can agree on, right? Whether or not it exists, that is what God means to us. If you disagree, I would like to hear your definition, so that we have a common starting point. Existence is certain, there is no question of that. The proof is in itself, existence is happening. There are two options for its origin, ie its creation: either it was created at a point in time, or it has always existed. If it was created at a point in time, it is impossible for it not to have a creator. Whatever created it at that point in time, is its creator, is God. If it has always existed, it must have created itself at the beginning of time.

Why do I say that it must have been created, instead of saying that it was never created, since it always existed? My answer to that, is because time began. If time began, then the universe began. The universe could not have existed before time, because the universe is contained in space-time. Without time, there is no container for the universe to fill. 

So, if time began, totality began. If totality began, it was created. If totality is all there is, there was nothing else to create it, but itself. You could make an argument here that totality is not interchangeable with the universe, but this is only true if you consider imaginary things (like the laws of physics) real. But by definition, imaginary things are not real, even though they do exist as imaginary things.

The question left is whether or not time began. We have an approximation for the age of the universe, just under 13.8 billion years. I can't pretend to understand why we have this number, so I can't say it must be correct. However, if the big bang theory is at all close to a representation of what happened, what is happening, then time beginning is a logical conclusion. Everything exploded, but it must have exploded from something. One thing. The singularity. Before the explosion, is before space, before time- these emerge(d) from the singularity. So, at the beginning of the explosion, you will find the beginning of time. I don't believe it will ever be possible to say ""the universe began exactly this amount of time ago"", but I DO think that we can say ""the universe did not exist 20 billion years ago"". For a somewhat abstract example, Pi definitely exists, we use it all the time. We can't say exactly what it is numerically, but we can say it's more than 3 and less than 4, definitely.

I tried to be as linear as possible with this explanation. If you disagree with some conclusion I've made, let's discuss this further. I am certain, that reason alone is enough to prove the existence of God, assuming a fundamental definition (ie not ""a fitting entity for descriptions in christianity"")."

Suppose that a divine being were to try and tell a creature to love itself. How would it do that? I'll let you figure that one out for yourself (my guess would be neurochemical inclinations to survive).

Yes I did see stuff, and yes it was created by God. Everything is created by God, duh. God created everything. That's like the one and only premise of God, it's the creator of all. Anyway, there was no hallucination, I didn't see anything that wasn't there.

Some things don't fit into words, so when you are ready for a certain type of experience, you will not be ready to articulate very well. However, you may still smuggle back a few gems in the rough. In time, they will be clean. The dirt, scraped away; edges deburred. Their light will shine, when you've long-since exited the cave. In the future, you will discover the importance of self-love if you haven't already. The idea in itself is moving. It was to me, anyway. That's why I wanted to share it. I understand that you can't transfer an experience through a paragraph of text, and that's why I'm not too distraught that it wasn't well received. Hopefully, you can understand why I would want to share this."

All of them are made by humans though, who are inevitably partial to their own circumstances. You wouldn't start a charity for starving kids if you didn't know that starving kids existed, right? Your own experience, you're tied to it. Nothing different for anybody that recorded the ""word of God"". So, why follow others when you can receive it yourself? Others can help you find it, but you will only know it for yourself, once you do. I think religion is good at getting people stuck."

The fact that God let me know anything is proof that God exists, yeah? The proof that God let me know something is that I wrote it down here and claimed that God let me know something. I have no reason to lie, there's nothing to lose or gain here for me. This is just information. Whether it's direct or not, it is information nonetheless. If you can make use of it, perhaps it will be for your better. If you can't, I am content in the fact that at worst you're mildly frustrated."
CasualConversation,fctba7f,t1_fct7f0q,1577937945.0,"God did. It wasn't words, but I saw abstract images that conveyed complex emotions and feelings. It showed me that everything needs to love itself, in order for all of this to work. That's what I got out of it, anyway. If singular cell organisms didn't love themselves, they would not evolve into us. They would not live. That need to care for yourself, if that wasn't in place then evolution wouldn't have happened. Not that I'm saying that's at all possible, I'm just saying if. If nothing self-loved, God would not exist, because God exists only as a God that loves itself. It could not exist in any other way, because nothing can exist without loving itself to some degree. That's why you breathe even without trying, and you can't just stop breathing on your own. Because you have a desire to exist, whether you recognize that or not. Without a desire to exist, there is no reason to breathe. It is pointless, why do something that leads towards something you don't want to do, right? Self-love is hardwired into your circuitry, to keep you alive until your time comes."
