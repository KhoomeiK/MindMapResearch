technology,fcutyb6,t1_fcus94z,1577988434.0,"Hey I agree with you. I was just pointing out the comparison in terms of unqualified people making bank for whatever the heck they are doing. Making 50k a month for that position is nothing but grease on the skids. I mean that‚Äôs gotta be obvious to you, though it did look like soviet what-aboutism and you correctly pointed that out. 
I‚Äôm not being politically biased here at all. It‚Äôs a valid observation. 
Note: I should know better than say anything with any nuance about politics or more generally, at all. We‚Äôre pretty much living the death of intelligent public discourse.  They‚Äôre winning."

Right now, if she has any sense of herself it probably isn‚Äôt worth the trouble to her. She‚Äôs getting ripped for this and rightfully so. Reminds me of the look Merkel gave her."
Economics,fctyb3r,t3_eis1z7,1577965593.0,This is long overdue.
Economics,fctwddt,t3_eisokh,1577962922.0,"Death and disease make for an inelastic market. Of course the company will find the maximum pricing that is supported. He wouldn‚Äôt be working there for long if he didn‚Äôt do his job. He will probably increase charges until around 8-10% of the population can‚Äôt pay. This would be about maximum for me. Follow the parasite rule...it is not in your interest to kill the host, but leave the host no more healthy than need be. Find the edge of death and stay there."

todayilearned,fcp1u19,t1_fcp0n36,1577847884.0,"Weird to think about how much has changed or maybe it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm old enough to have seen so much. I live in SoCal now, I went to school and I‚Äôm a consultant. I can hardly believe how poor everybody I mean everybody was back then. Maybe it had a southern bend to it. 
Gas was 15 cents a gallon and movie tickets were 35 cents. I could turn in a coke bottle for three cents deposit and buy six fresh baked cookies from Tom and Mary‚Äôs General Store. Lol. I lived in Mayberry RFD, but with poverty, bigotry and stark ignorance. 
My family were farmers and on welfare, no one had more than a sixth grade education. I know for sure they couldn‚Äôt read or write. It‚Äôs crazy the mention of gubmint cheese brings all this back."

Right after that we‚Äôd run behind the bug spray truck that went through the neighborhood. Huge billowing clouds of blue smoke, pretty sure it was DDT. Such a weird time - mid 60s."

This is still happening now in maybe lesser more insidious ways. Reference the inequality for women in leadership  in business and politics. The #metoo movement, the fact that California had to pass a law for a minimum female representation on corporate boards of directors are examples.
