AskReddit,fffzivk,t3_etbrdf,1579895209.0,My cat Splat knows when I am sad and comes and lays on my chest.  No one taught her how to be a support cat but she is.
offmychest,feugeqi,t3_eqmu54,1579386292.0,Oh gosh please don’t!  Ok maybe the kids are grown and on their own but you still raised them.  Do you still have them?  I was suicidal for lots of years but I could always feel some hope in some things.  Please try!
unpopularopinion,fepus0g,t3_eqci3k,1579332036.0,"I think if you have enough time to be calling out people who are looking for ways to cope, then yes, have my upvote!  I vented about a particularly horrible thing that happened to my “family.”  I vented here on Reddit because my friends and family were too torn up to be of any use and I didnt know what else to do."
AskReddit,fencpqe,t3_eq0bsw,1579281877.0,"My 21 year old son, in his first ever relationship of three whole freaking months,  told me his girlfriend is five weeks pregnant with a child that they both planned.  He has a job that is not the best paying at the moment but had potential for advancement were he to go to school.  When he met his girlfriend, he stopped paying his bills, moved out and became distant.  I don’t see him going to school.  Oh and not to mention, his girlfriend cries if anyone teases her, she is so thin, and quit school where she was going to get a degree to become a teacher because she “gets angry so quickly.”  What is the pathetic little waif going to do when the baby cries?  This girl has admitted that she is broken and that she tires of everyone easily.  She is also manipulative and controlling.  She also told people repeatedly that her mom constantly begged her to give her a grandbaby even though she was not in a stable relationship.  Her side of the family is so excited for this baby while my side is gearing up for the potential backlash.  I never ever asked my kids for grandkids in fact, quite the opposite as kids are just not my cup of tea.  I raised mine as a single mother for 19 years s I have had my fair share.   I am not nor will I ever be excited for this child that was so poorly planned and it has left me in such a bind because I feel sad for the baby and my son."
