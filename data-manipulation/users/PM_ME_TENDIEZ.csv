hoggit,fd1g7gm,t1_fd16ya9,1578130958.0,"So basically my key is to try to stay close to the same alt as the target I want to kill.  This gets increasingly more important as the target gets closer.  

As they get closer if I lose lock I point the nose of my aircraft in their direction (up/down).  In tws you can tell if you've lost tws lock because the number on the right of the target has disappeared.  When you nose up or down, if they're in range of your missile, they'll start flashing again.

If there is a cluster of enemies I shoot in tws obviously, especially if they're relatively close to eachother distance wise from me.

I try to use STT lock (jester target enemy ahead) more often than not unless I'm in a pvp server in which case I launch from further away in tws.  I tend to focus enemies one at a time when the situation allows it.  If not and its just a giant cluster fuck of a furball headed my way I spam the missiles and RTB as their countdowns near 15ish.

If the enemy starts notching you, well even a human rio will have a harder time keeping up the lock.  Maneuver for a better firing solution.  While constantly spamming target enemy ahead in the jest menu.

You can almost always guarantee an STT lock of the target as long as jester has them bugged in tws.  You can guarantee the target you want gets locked by using stt lock tws target x or specific target if you have a general idea of their alt and range.  

I also map jester commands to the keypad so my neck doesnt get worn out."
hoggit,fd15wuz,t1_fd113ce,1578127885.0,I actually have learned how to use him well that regards by using lock specific target or lock enemy in front but I only issue those commands if they're still bugged in tws.

hoggit,fd15mcd,t1_fd0zaj4,1578127774.0,"No I mean I noticed it happens when a friendly is near an enemy.  For instance, i saw a mig29 getting ready to shoot down Texaco.

hoggit,fcn9sws,t1_fcmoy52,1577806912.0,"With planes like the F15c and f18c especially,  it's just so easy to fly.  You can yank your stick (lol) as hard as you want and the plane will comply, and you do some very slick acrobatics.  As far as fc3 planes are concerned that's a little less true with the su27 and su33. 

Now with the f14 you simply cant do that.  You have to be very aware of how much AoA you're pulling at any given time.  Luckily the ribbon is right next to the hud for you to see.  The plane also shakes and buffets during maneuvers and the sounds it makes are just so perfect.  That's what I mean by it feels like I'm really flying.  I have to pay attention the whole time or I'm gonna put myself into the ground.  Also when you deploy weapons like the phoenix,  you know exactly when it leaves the pylon bc you can 'feel it' in the plane, not to mention getting caught in the wake of that huge motor.

One thing to add is having flown the f15c for so many years when I initially bought the tomcat, I flew it for about an hour and hated it.  It was uninstalled for almost a month before I decided I reallllly wanted to learn how to fly it (mainly to splash people at 60nm) lol.  But I really hated all the analog steam gauges and lack of information on the hud compared to the newer planes that had so much more information available to me.  Now it seems I realized I dont need any of that information at all,  I just needed a few really important things and everything else is meh."

You really cant go wrong with any module,  the flaming cliffs package is a good buy and I always suggest it to new players as it has a variety of different planes to try.  The radar and avionics are simplified bc it's not full fidelity but it does take a significant amount of seat time to get good at flying any of them bc of the advanced flight models.

I've heard so many good things about the f5 though so, really just pick a plane you love and go for it, none of them are very hard to operate if you dedicate any amount of time to flying.

All of the modules including the fc3 planes will take a significant amount of time to get ""good"" at flying."
