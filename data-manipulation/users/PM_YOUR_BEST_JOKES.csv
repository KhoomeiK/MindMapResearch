CivVI,fesr004,t3_eqdigq,1579368088.0,"As the ages progress, barbs can be interpreted differently. They are essentially units that do not belong to the established civs/city states. 

Some examples

- Unrecognised new states such as ISIL
- Militia organisations such as those in the middle east
- Local warlords outside the control of the nation (these would be more like partisans)
- Pirates like those off the coast of Somalia
- Indigenous populations that developed into new nations (but civ lacks the mechanism for forming new civs)"

>by the time I hit the next war, their units were wrecking me. The army strength number I guess goes by number of units or something since I was well over the country beating me. 

I'm not really sure what you're talking about, but ""combat"" and ""strength"" are what would be helpful to read about here. One particular point that needs mentioning is that the strength number does not scale linearly (60 vs 50 is just as much of a difference in strength as 20 vs 10).

>Walls without a catapult are a no-go. I tried the battering ram and the tower to ignore them being adjacent but it still said wall defense so I dunno. 

The UI can be confusing... wall health and city health are counted separately, but can sometimes be damaged together at different proportions, or one at a time. Siege combat is also confusing (for example, different damage types and what proportion of their damage they do to walls vs the city itself). Reading about siege combat will be helpful.

megalophobia,fes4gf8,t1_ferzw7y,1579361326.0,"The Chinese government cares more about threats to its power than religion per se. Here's an excerpt from Wikipedia and their Constitution

> The radical policy relaxed considerably in the late 1970s. Since 1978, the Constitution of the People's Republic of China guarantees ""freedom of religion"". Its article 36 states that:

> ""Citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of religious belief. No state organ, public organization or individual may compel citizens to believe in, or not to believe in, any religion; nor may they discriminate against citizens who believe in, or do not believe in, any religion. The state protects normal religious activities. No one may make use of religion to engage in activities that disrupt public order, impair the health of citizens or interfere with the educational system of the state. Religious bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign domination.""


Notice the key exceptions 

- no disruption of public order (don't protest against us)

- no interference with education (don't teach anything counter to what we teach)

- not subject to foreign domination (don't be loyal to the Vatican or Mecca instead of us, for example)


So there is no contradiction here. Because this statue of the ""god of war"" is no threat to the government's power, it's ok. But if a group's religious expression involves setting up a Catholic school or demonstrations against the persecution of Falun Gong for example, that's trouble in the government's eyes"
