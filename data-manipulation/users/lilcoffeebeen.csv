ToobAmps,fgmg4ot,t3_ez4f2x,1580923853.0,Yeah easy but it won’t behave the same way without tubes to cook it up.
addiction,fgkjacp,t3_eytyzc,1580866863.0,Something about addiction or the hard life experience addiction brings really squashes the light out. Because I feel the same damn way. I haven’t been able to enjoy sober life for a week straight. It just sucks. Lol.
therapy,fghs62n,t1_fghohxl,1580792331.0,Thank you! No money for therapy at the moment so I’m just surfing Reddit for now hehe

SuicideWatch,fgf13ny,t3_exulwy,1580718765.0,Hope you are alive out there. I’m sorry for what you are feeling..
SuicideWatch,fgf0ze2,t3_ey1pgm,1580718591.0,I feel you except I’m 35 (next month) and have a gf with a kid on the way. I don’t want it. No resume. No credentials. I have a job but it’s retail management. Some dumbass kid job that makes me feel sedentary. 5 years ago I was on my feet not giving a fuck goofing off having a good time. Now I’m a broke ass has-been with a mean ass girlfriend that’s trying to force me to become a fuckin sweater dad. Anyways good luck. I feel for you.
benzorecovery,fgf0n08,t3_exsq7z,1580718097.0,Advice: just start. Stop thinking about starting. Taper slow but taper now. Fuck benzo. Stop em. Good luck; work hard.
SuicideWatch,fgf0fp1,t3_ey1p3k,1580717814.0,Yep. Me. I can’t stand being here. Tho I don’t actively think about suicide; that thought is not in my routine. Thinking about how stupid it is here is what I wake up to and what I fall asleep to.. good luck.
ToobAmps,fgezepf,t3_exulay,1580716415.0,He got it back to you cheap as hell and you are happy with the work. Wouldn’t call that sketch. Maybe he just has poor social skills. Maybe he was stoned. Maybe he had you confused with another customer.

CPTSD,fg60xmq,t3_ewqqxx,1580547895.0,Everyone is so obsessed with getting her fired. How trendy. And boring.
CPTSD,fg60q7f,t3_ewqqxx,1580547596.0,You fired her? Don’t you mean *you made the decision to not go back for another session then got on Reddit to say you fired your therapist* today? You sound like a hero.

therapy,fg5x686,t3_ewzytp,1580542700.0,I’m 35 and I feel like a kid. You prob think there’s some threshold between the two worlds but there isn’t. You aren’t going to walk across a line. Just be the best you can without considering age.
benzorecovery,fg1968b,t1_ffz38f3,1580423050.0,Well hopefully I’ll reach the point of being sober and normal with no xanax in my drawer lol. I hear you tho...

benzorecovery,ffyvso5,t1_ffyvnp1,1580356392.0,Thank you for that comment! Yeah I’m pushing through and trying to forget the option existed for me tonight. I’m just so beyond exhausted and I know I have several months of this left
benzorecovery,ffypwxn,t1_ffyptz6,1580352267.0,I appreciate that. Yeah I’ve been tempted lately but I’m off work tomorrow and tonight I was just thinking about how damn chill it would be to take a small nibble more. I haven’t felt relief from xanax in so long. Ugh! I’m sticking with it tho.

Ibanez,ff4hc5k,t1_ff4h82i,1579563622.0,Yeah I prob won’t have this one splattered or swirled just because it lacks that wildness without a floating trem but I’ll do something with paint just to clean it up.
Ibanez,ff4gpp3,t1_ff4g60m,1579563194.0,I ended up getting my buddy’s 7621 because he didn’t want much more for it and it has a hipshot hard tail bridge and hip shot locking tuners with titans with a coil tap and a 5 way switch. All it needs is a damn paint job.
Ibanez,ff2dm6d,t1_ff2d60z,1579501849.0,Yup my last 7620 I got for 325. This one is 500 bucks but man it’s super clean. I’m not stoked on paying 500 for it but it’s still better than buying a modern prestige for 800+ even tho I want a maple board. Either way I’ll be swapping electronics for tone zone/-air norton

benzorecovery,fdnvrn9,t3_em9iwr,1578593839.0,Yes. This is standard for me. Keep going.
Testosterone,fdnlufd,t1_fdnkld5,1578588498.0,I mean. I make enough money to keep paying for it. And to go to another clinic. It’s just a bunk priority especially with a pregnant girlfriend.
benzodiazepines,fdmjww4,t3_em102o,1578552638.0,Agreed; I’ve had a prescription for the last 6 years.
Testosterone,fdmjssz,t1_fdm6frj,1578552513.0,Yeah tbh I’m satisfied with the way this planned out. I got a lot of useful advice and some good support.
Testosterone,fdm94zs,t1_fdm8rqn,1578542899.0,I looked for it earlier but i guess I deleted the convo in my phone w the link. like I said in some of these comments.. it wasn’t specifically that article... I know it’s prob bullshit or misrepresents the actual facts. But there’s endless info warning against test. And I’m sick of seeing it whilst having no confidence in the business I attend to keep me up to date on product info. They keep me in the dark and just expect me to take stuff and not ask questions. It’s just the continuous contraction of information and the techs at my clinic not being able to keep me confident in them mixed with the lack of funds to spin off and go somewhere else to only hope it’s not as incompetent as the place i am currently attending.
addiction,fdm8h8k,t3_em40h7,1578542409.0,It’s a godsend.

Testosterone,fdm1aew,t1_fdlu7gy,1578537434.0,It’s pretty fuckin scary tbh. I watched my best friend die of cancer from his bedside when I was 23 years old and i have extreme post traumatic stress from that experience so cancer scares the living shit out of me
Testosterone,fdm14ob,t1_fdm0qm0,1578537325.0,The possible long term side effects freak me the fuck out but the main problem is the lack of info and help I get from the clinic that put me on my TRT plan. They just give me shit and act surprised when I have any questions. They are way too cool and not serious enough. They don’t keep up with my plan either. When I show up they can’t remember what I’m there for. Even tho I’m there upon their request for lab work or giving blood or whatever. It’s very important for me to have consistent solid communication with them and I have none. And I don’t have money to bounce around to another clinic. If I knew the community here in my town and knew where else to attend then maybe. But my experience is shot and I’m over it.
Testosterone,fdm05jh,t1_fdlzzbn,1578536665.0,"Well I have lots of mixed emotions about that comment but thank you for sharing. I am so worried about my dick and balls, here. I’m going to bust ass running and dieting and hope it helps."
Testosterone,fdltd1r,t1_fdlplqb,1578532028.0,That’s a good idea and I’m actually going to do that
GuitarAmps,fdlo17o,t1_fdlnozf,1578528398.0,Thanks I’ll check it out.
Testosterone,fdlnmks,t1_fdlnjwg,1578528121.0,Best comment of the bunch; thanks!
Testosterone,fdln5p1,t1_fdlmx5e,1578527813.0,True. If I was on a more clear plan and if my technicians were more involved in the process and had their shit together then I prob wouldn’t be ending it. And I don’t have the cash to bounce around to another office. So it’s time to be done and I’ll just amp Up the gym and focus on my diet. My techs really have botched this whole thing for me. I wasn’t miserable before so it’s all good. I just wanna be safe about coming off. It’s only been 4 months so hopefully I’m just being dramatic about being worried about it
Testosterone,fdlmkw8,t1_fdlmbwn,1578527430.0,I’m mainly tired of hearing/reading conflicting info. I’m not interested in this shit nearly enough to add it to my life. When I began i didn’t realize I’d be constantly switching levels and adding diff meds. First it was hcg. Then it was double the hcg. Then anastrozole. At this point fuck em. I wasn’t miserable before. Just somewhat dull. I’ll supplement with extra diet and exercise.
GuitarAmps,fdlm25t,t1_fdlc4bn,1578527087.0,I just want something for my apartment. Just got rid of a ton of big rig / show gear. I don’t want a bunch of pedals and chords and I like the drive and reverb in a HRD. It won’t be going anywhere just in my living room.
Testosterone,fdllkm2,t1_fdllgmq,1578526771.0,Yeah def. I agree w all of that. I just wanna quit correctly.
Testosterone,fdlg6ng,t1_fdlg09o,1578523325.0,Thanks yeah I’m def considering doing a low dose for a couple weeks then quitting cold after that. It’s only been 4 months since I first started.
Testosterone,fdlfqtm,t1_fdlfoe9,1578523054.0,Thank you!
Testosterone,fdlfbm3,t1_fdlf7wi,1578522793.0,Oh word gotcha. Thanks
Testosterone,fdlf609,t1_fdlerb0,1578522699.0,Thanks! Yeah I have a child on the way and just don’t have money to prioritize to finding a new clinic. I’m just ready to be back to how I was 4 months ago. Wasn’t that bad off. Also I just don’t have the interest to be steady tweaking around. I’m not that into it. I am going to inject half a dose tomorrow and refrain from hcg and the anastrozole and maybe even less the following week depending on how I feel and what info I gather
Testosterone,fdlew64,t1_fdlejwd,1578522535.0,Yeah I am just tired of the constant balancing of the “meds” and constant tweaking. Not worth it for me anymore. Also I have a kid on the way and I’m reading way too much negative stuff about this stuff. So basically I’m done. I am prob going to inject a half of a ML tomorrow instead of a full one to buy myself another week of figuring out how to come off a little smoother
Testosterone,fdlenpp,t1_fdlejst,1578522396.0,Tumor marker? There’s so much conflicting info available I just feel like quitting is the best option.
Testosterone,fdleiz3,t1_fdlebus,1578522316.0,This was the attitude I was going for when I began TRT against my comfort zone but ultimately I can’t get on board with it. But lol I feel ya.
GuitarAmps,fdledbu,t1_fdlcjjn,1578522221.0,I don’t know exactly why but the HRD sounds like the amp I want. I actually just got rid of all my silverface amps I have been using drive pedals in front or twin/super/dual showman reverbs for years. Just sort of want an apartment amp at this point instead of a bunch of gear laying around lol
Testosterone,fdle4b8,t1_fdle1bv,1578522069.0,"Oh word. I think at my clinic they just give you a vile of hcg and tell you to use it daily for a week or two and you are done but after reading all the shit linking high levels of hcg to cancer, I’m good on that.."
Testosterone,fdldswa,t1_fdld1rc,1578521877.0,My hcg is empty as of last week. My girlfriend sent me an article linking hcg to cancer and that was the final straw for me. I’ve been on the fence way too long. Not enough benefits. I was fine before.
Testosterone,fdlcctm,t1_fdlc3iz,1578521001.0,My estrogen was super high and they put me on anastrozole. They don’t have the awareness to really keep me on track. Every time I come in they seem confused about the plan like we didn’t just speak and make plans. I just don’t feel confident with them. I don’t really care enough or have the cash to swing to another office. I just wanna be done at this point. Tomorrow is my injection day so I was either halving the dose or stopping altogether.
