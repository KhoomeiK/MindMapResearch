I shared your concern about the padding because my 1460's don't have any padding whatsoever but I manage long days even in those. Even though, I almost went with more robust Docs when I discovered [they actually do have some padding!](https://imgur.com/a/U1Mg4MM) And what cushioning is concerned, I can just change inner soles, I'm not working electronics"
