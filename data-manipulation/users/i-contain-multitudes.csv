untrustworthypoptarts,ffzvirc,t1_ffy9d91,1580393998.0,It feels good to get approval. It's not a difficult concept. Yeah logically it doesn't matter but there are lots of things that don't matter that most people still care about.
NobodyAsked,ffz8tid,t1_ffx8z1c,1580367586.0,My partner and I love 30 minute sex. Why is it sad that I have the kind of sex that my partner and I like?

relationships,ffxxoad,t1_ffxtcft,1580334451.0,Why do you think that only kids that entered adulthood around the recession had financial trouble? Minimum wage hasn't risen in ten years in the united states. Everyone I know has to work two jobs just to make rent and eat. Yeah the economy might be better but poor people are still just as bad off if not worse.

auntienetwork,ffsxlw7,t3_euoecp,1580196701.0,"I would recommend focusing on strategies to reduce your anxiety. You've read tons of articles and taken pregnancy tests and everything points to not pregnant, yet you're still anxious. And that's fine. I have an anxiety disorder too. But what would help you right now is anti-anxiety strategies. Everyone has their own that work for them, but here are some suggestions: exercise (proven to be similar in effectiveness to medication), relaxing music, reading a good book, cleaning up, etc."

TalesFromRetail,ffpjphk,t1_ffpjaxk,1580096691.0,"Another thing is that anger is a masking emotion, which means anger is not a feeling all by itself, it's a feeling one feels to ""mask"" another feeling. Often hurt, embarrassment, feeling tricked, etc. So if you look at those base emotions, crying is actually a really reasonable response."
WitchyMail,ffpiw85,t3_euhylg,1580096120.0,What kind of person are you looking for and how would you describe your personality?
TalesFromRetail,ffpiu70,t1_ffp977o,1580096082.0,Yeah but crying is actually a very healthy way to relieve anger. More so than yelling or kicking stuff or anything like that.
AmItheAsshole,ffpih36,t1_ffokm39,1580095831.0,"Arch support is important not only for flat-footed individuals but for individuals with high arches. My feet hurt if I stand for too long without arch support and I have high arches. That being said, if the in laws are not standing for any significant length of time, they should be fine unless there's an extenuating circumstance e.g. a disability. I only wear shoes inside my house when I cook or if I have to go to the bathroom so badly that I don't have time to take them off when I walk in the door."

sex,ffk7dpb,t1_ffiz6d2,1580018150.0,It's different with your peers. 16 year old girl giving another 16 year old girl a back rub is not creepy. It really depends on the vibe between her and her dad as to whether or not that's creepy though. But honestly I can't really believe that this story is real anyway so.

OutOfTheLoop,ffgzyjm,t1_ffgwggf,1579919424.0,"In my experience, and I'm queer, gay people saying ""the gays"" is not a reclamation, it's more like making fun of straight people who say it, like an inside joke."
OutOfTheLoop,ffgzue6,t1_ffgy36d,1579919338.0,"The reason the person above you said transgender isn't a gender is because it's a status. Transgender people have a gender: man, woman, non-binary, or anything else. Like for example, this is not a great one but like your flight may be delayed. The people on that flight are not called ""delayeds."" 

The reason ""males"" and ""females"" are accepted forms is because those words are used as adjectives and nouns, not just adjectives. The way ""transgenders"" sounds is similar to people saying ""the gays"" or ""the blacks."""
FragileWhiteRedditor,ffcjd4t,t1_ffcg2b7,1579800706.0,"In the sidebar, it says ""this is an xx space only, if you are xy go somewhere else"" which is transphobic. That's why people are saying they're TERFs.

TalesFromRetail,ffao0x8,t1_ffa7n7m,1579740454.0,"You said if the guy attacks someone else, they're both 100% responsible. In that case, they should both be punished the same way. If two accomplices in a crime were both equally responsible, that is how the sentence would be carried out.

But if you want to ignore that, that's fine. We can just focus on you victim-blaming instead. 

To state that both parties in a previous attacker-victim instance are equally responsible for an attack will hypothetically happen tomorrow is simply ludicrous."
