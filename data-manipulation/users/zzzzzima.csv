BreakUps,feya8f5,t3_eqk559,1579442879.0,"It feels like they say ""i want to stay in contact"" because they don't want to look bad or they didn't find anybody else to talk.
It's never easy to get over it but it's better to cut the contact before we get hurt again.
Don't take the whole blame on yourself and let it go as soon as possible."
dating_advice,fea228v,t1_fe9zjjf,1578943557.0,"It depends on the person, some people see eyes first, or a smile. I wasn't talking about being loved but how to grab attention (or what i find attractive)."
dating_advice,fe9ozzw,t3_eo7yfa,1578940174.0,"For me it doesn't really matter if a guy is short, if you want to raise your confidence you can start working out (it helps, some guys are just tall and skinny with no muscles which is not very attractive), i pay attention to clothes, if they fit and are clean and perfumes (nice smell can do amazing things).
Rest is about personality so it's waaay harder, good luck :)"

Even if it's cringy on the outside but feels good, who cares, just do it.
Good luck :)"

I wish you all the best."

depression,fd9qhxd,t1_fd9njcf,1578236700.0,"Maybe it won't be right to say but sometimes when we know there is an escape, that we don't have to carry on but we can, it's making things a bit easier.
It's really cruel to say that suicide is selfish and take that choice away."

depression,fd2kw9r,t3_ejx5rj,1578148687.0,"The thing is, people who never experienced depression won't understand how it feels. 
I've also heard that suicide is selfish and i think it's not something we can judge.
From my experience working out helps with self esteem but it's not the cure. 
Talking with psychologist and taking meds suggested by a doc will be the best option."
BreakUps,fcyan1h,t3_ejjgcf,1578077224.0,"You can't change what already happened. 
Looking at her social media won't make things better for you, it's time to let go of this relationship. I know it hurts a lot when somebody who once was special is pushing us away.
When we're in love everything looks brighter. We make a picture of that person in our head but often it's not a real picture at all. 
In my case dating other people helps. Try to think less what other people think of you and it will get easier."
