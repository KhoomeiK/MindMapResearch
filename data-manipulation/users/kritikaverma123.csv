AskReddit,femloz2,t3_epzbpz,1579261650.0,"The one I find valid is the theory that the attack on 9–11 **was not carried out by 19 Arabs led by Bin Laden,** that it would have been impossible for that group alone to pull it off.

1. First of all, there's *not one Arab passenger*  listed on the manifest of one of the four fatal flights. Who hijacked  that one? This huge fact is something the world seems to have overlooked  or voluntarily buried. So it's clear that *not only Arabs* were involved in this crime against humanity.
2. Four  of the individuals named by the FBI as the perpetrators who died in the  hijacked planes were still alive after the event. One was an airline  pilot living in Egypt.
3. America's defense system was totally  dismantled on that day, to the point that not one of the four hijacked  planes was ever approached by an intercepting military plane  \[!!!!!!!!!!!\] even though they were all in the air for at least an hour.  One squadron of F16s on the search were ordered to leave the US and  continue their search over the Atlantic \[!!!!!!!\] This is something  which Bin Laden and 19 Arabs, no matter how skilled, could not have  arranged."

If something like that drives you crazy and  you have to yap about it, it's a **pet peeve**. **Pet peeves** tend to be smaller issues. No one would call terrorism a **pet peeve**."
