AustralianTeachers,ff8gvyt,t3_es6s45,1579677935.0,"This is my 11th year teaching. Every year I apply for multiple jobs, have been passed over because a graduate was cheaper/easier to mold into what they want (not begrudging the graduate teachers. I love working with them). It sucks and I hate the uncertainty. I did seriously consider doing something else after last year with awful principal and admin. But I got a job on Monday in a school that seems great with supportive admin. My experience is that it's the best teachers who aren't good at applying and interviews. Please stick with it. Find a mentor to help you with applying (also do PL)."
