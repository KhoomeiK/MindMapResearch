What I am getting at is we all draw a ""line"" somewhere about what we are comfortable killing and for what reason.  For some people that line for food goes right up to just under human.  For others it is no animals at all, but bugs are ok.  
The thing we can basically all agree on though is that it is better to reduce suffering when we kill (for whatever reason we kill).  So finding ways which reduce that suffering is something that people will get behind.  Trying to change where people draw the line can work, but is unlikely."

That is a massive amount of protein for less than a dollar.  Animals will be a thing for a good bit yet, especially eggs.  What I think will change things is lab grown meat.  If we can start getting off of cows, and pigs we will be in a better place ecologically.  Plus lab grown meat IS MEAT.  There is just no reason to grow a whole cow, when you can grow the steak.  With less chance of disease and steaks that are impossibly large, marbled, and tender at low prices will help make lab grown meat the sensible choice.

As for atheists I feel that many of us feel that if people want to believe in a higher power, there is no harm in that.  As long as you try to be a good person and not impose your beliefs on others, most people will not care if you are religious.  I have some deeply religious friends and they are good, smart people.  Their religion gives them something, but since they don't force it on others I have no reason to complain.  I do encourage that they try to make informed choices and not let their religion cause themselves harm, just as they encourage me to seek meaning in my choices and decisions.  The hatred of religion is not hatred of the religious.  It is hatred for organizations and ways of thinking which cause harm to people (the religious and the larger community)."

If you mean gender as sex: sure (intersex, etc being rare and a deformity).
When people talk about gender as a spectrum, what they tend to mean is the social construct of gender (men do x, women do y).  It sounds odd because it is trying to give names to the things that were just variations within the group (the whole spectrum idea).  As an example, I am a man and I like to sew, carry a purse (satchel), and think skirts are comfortable as fuck (so much breathability).  I also work on my cars, fix my house, shoot guns, and have a large beard. To me this doesn't make me a gender non-conforming something or other.  It just means that I am a guy that has many hobbies which include sewing and I like to have a bag with me.  For other people they feel that those non-conforming characteristics are a deep portion of who they are and they want to let people know that.  They call themselves whatever label they feel fits and hope it helps others understand them better.  It doesn't change who they are or anything else, it is just a handy label."

science,ffdzq9a,t1_ffdpq5n,1579832979.0,"Part of the problem is in wording and how it is applied.  Take the ""4 or more injured, not including the shooter"" as an example.  I will give an insane example to illustrate the point.


 A person is at a party and accidently fires 1 shot.  It goes toward someone, but it only grazes the person.  The bullet continues on to hit a thick glass vase.  The vase shatters spreading glass across the floor and some shards into 1 other person.  This causes panic and 2 people step onto the glass from the vase and cut their feet badly.  The person who fired the shot freaks out and throws the gun, and it hits 1 different person in the face and breaks their nose.  


Is this a mass shooting?  You have 5 people injured in the event that are not the gunman.  So it could be, but only 3 people were harmed by the bullet, gun, and direct energy from the bullet.  Or is it only 1 person since they were the only one actually injured by the bullet.

ADHD,fec9eet,t1_fe6klc1,1578968991.0,"Huh, your process sounds similar to mine, but most of it is a quick thought type of thing.  The deciding if I want a sandwich, chips, etc is all done before I have decided to make a sandwich.     Once that choice is made my process is like so:


1.  Go to the kitchen.

2. Get each thing I will need in one place.  Bread, peanut butter, jelly, 2 spoons, and a plate.  The order is not important as long as they end up in the same place at the same time.

3.  I put the bread on the plate

4. I use the back of a spoon to apply peanut butter to both pieces of bread (highly important to keep the jelly from making the bread soggy).  Also by apply the peanut butter to both pieces first it avoids an issue if I rip a piece of bread.  

5.  I use the other spoon to stir and scoop an adequate amount of jelly into the center of one of the pieces of bread.  (The stirring will make sense in the next 2 step).

6. Place the other piece of bread on top of the jellied piece.

7. Press the edges of the sandwich together, making a nice jelly pocket.  Stirred jelly will spread nicely inside the pocket and not attempt to poke through softer breads.  It will also not have any weird water on the jelly to spoil the texture.

8. Put all thing away (spoons in sink, jelly in fridge, etc)

9. Take sandwich to where it will be eaten.

10.  Eat a fairly clean pb&j because my jelly stays inside my sandwich.


This skips all the little side thoughts I have, while doing this.  They don't get in my way though since I can hold my general task in my head (make a pb&j).  If I lose my place I just look at where I am in the process and continue towards my goal.  1 goal at a time.  The steps are not my goal and are not a conscious thought process.  The thought is make a pb&j and keep that thought until I have one."

A partner has a general right to know something like that, much in the same way they have a right to know if you have an odd kink or other facts which could reasonably be assumed may impact their decision on whether or not to sleep with you.  


From a practical stand point it makes sense to tell your perspective partner.  Some people will react negatively and it is safer for that to happen in public.  If you are pre-op it makes even more sense."

politics,fe7un7t,t1_fe7fok5,1578919455.0,"Some of those antique weapons ARE AKs and ARs.  The AK47 has 47 in it for a reason (1947).  Sure many people own newer versions, but even those are designs from the 50's and 60's.  The AR is a 60's -70's gun as well.  Many guns have the same features, but because they don't look scary they do not get mentioned.  That is part of the issue with trying to ban guns by model.  What you probably want to go after is semi-automatic firearms which take an external magazine.  This includes damn near all modern rifles though and makes an outright ban politically impossible.  You may be able to limit their ownership though.  If laws were crafted in a way which support gun ownership of manual action guns while placing semi-automatic guns in their own category you might get some traction. 


As for body armor (soft types) piercing, that is any decent caliber rifle (hunting rifles).  Every hunter owns a gun capable of piercing basic body armor.  Rifles are meant to shoot leathally from a decent distance and that means a lot of power in a small package.  That is hard to stop with something that can be easily worn.  Pistols pack less of a punch in general, but are the real killers because you can hide them.  If you see a guy carrying a rifle you know he has a gun and can be approached knowing that.  If someone has a pistol, you might not know until they point it at you and shoot."
politics,fe4hppe,t1_fe3fmth,1578859451.0,"There are a few issues with trying to limit detachable magazine capacity (namely magazines can be 3d printed / modified).  This leaves the real issue being semi-automatic firearms which take an external magazine.  A ban would be a VERY hard sell, but you may have some luck with setting up a new categorization system.  I think something like:

1. Muzzle loading (non-cartridge) long guns.

2. Single shot per barrel long guns

3. Manually cycled long guns (internal magazine)

4. Semi-automatic and remaining long guns

5. Pistols / guns below a certain overall total length

6. Machine guns / Automatic firearms


Make each category a bit harder to get.   Category 1 being age restricted only, category 2 being non-violent felons, and get more restrictive from that point onwards.  
This would promote basic firearm ownership while limiting the people who would own semi-automatic firearms.  It wouldn't ban them or even make them very hard to get, but by putting them behind a small hurdle like a simple safety and training course it would limit their ownership.  For many people a bolt action, pump, or lever action gun is sufficient.  Currently if I can buy one of those, it is just as easy to buy a semi-auto so I might as well.  So by adding that small hurdle you will likely reduce the sale of those guns overall since people are lazy.  Also pistols are the real killers, so more stringent controls on those would help more with overall deaths and gun crime."
politics,fe3z4bh,t1_fe3m2zg,1578854199.0,"Which is a bit of an issue for the people who live a rural lifestyle where guns are a necessity.  In the city you don't really need a rifle, shotgun, or pistol.  If you live 30 minutes to an hour away from ANY police or assistance a gun is a good thing to have.  Besides hunting, we have wild animals where I live (bears, coyotes, and some wild dogs).  I barely live in the woods at all, but I am still 15 minutes or so from any police even if they leave immediately.  It helps to have a gun around because there is a non-zero chance me, my family, my pets, or my other animals might be attacked and I cannot reasonably call for help.

This leads me to support gun ownership even though I am fairly liberal on everything else.  In the city a gun has less utility as a tool.  You can argue self protection (which is a decent argument), but I don't see that much use as a tool in a city.  The rural urban divide is becoming a larger issue as more people live in the cities.  This divide is a issue because we forget how the other side lives and what their needs are.  If you haven't lived in the woods it is easy to forget that guns are tools.  It would be like people from the country voting to suspend all public spending for water and sewer in the state because it is not something we get any benefit from (well and septic only where I am)."

Now cars get 200k without major repair fairly often and if anything major goes at less than 60k it is considered a crap car.  The early 90's had some cars which would get 200-300k and those are notable exception for being a quality car.  You also get more fuel economy today despite being safer more powerful cars. That does come at a cost though.  Tight tolerances and computer controls do not make for easy to fix cars in general (aside from dropping in a new part).  


The same is true for many home appliances (if you spend a bunch of money on them).  A $400 washer is fucking cheap.  Back in the 1990 you would pay $400 for a washer: that is the same as $800 today.  The modern washer will use much less water and less power.  They are also fairly easy to service, but few people bother.  A service call costs too much and a new washer is cheap.
