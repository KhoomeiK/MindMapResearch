dating_advice,fek6oel,t3_eoecmm,1579193730.0,"Lmao this had me so dead 🤣 , but I can feel your enthusiasm & excitement. I think its great you have developed a strong sense of confidence, just be mindful about how you carry yourself because based on personal experience (I'm a female & go to the gym regularly), most women prefer not to be approached by guys while working out. Of course it is variable, so some may not mind depending on the situation.

 I will say though- confidence is very admirable as well as humor, so if you exude that, often she will appreciate it (as long as you aren't too cocky). But next time, I would save some of that extra boldness for a more appropriate environment 😂 I'll give it to you though because that was one ride of a story 🤣"

rant,fe63l1y,t3_enx3tg,1578881012.0,So sorry for your loss 😢 sending hugs your way. No one truly understands the amount of love & memories one can share with a pet until they have one of their own. These moments are irreplaceable but you will cherish them forever. ♥️
