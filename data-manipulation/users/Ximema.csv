Or the community that religion can bring and the good it creates. Understanding their cause and being kind is more mature than saying lolz look at these nutjobs"
todayilearned,ffd2eu2,t1_ffd1kp4,1579812076.0,"That's your experience I guess, however defining an entire community by just a few members is a slippery slope"
todayilearned,ffd0o8x,t1_ffd02ji,1579811104.0,"Maybe because veganism is a thing that is centered around the dinner table, I do not see where you are going with it. Outdoor people would also talk about littering if they saw it on a trail or something, thus it's less of a common occurrence."
todayilearned,ffczzj7,t1_ffcz9w0,1579810725.0,"That was still a really cheap jab man, and besides, who else than environmentalists, vegans and outdoors people really care about the planet (and do something about it)?"
acecombat,fe6ofqe,t3_ej95xy,1578898120.0,Perfect list!
TrueOffMyChest,fcujk26,t1_fcuigba,1577982456.0,"Then do what? Nothing? 

If someone lights your house on fire, are you kindly going to ask them to stop, even after they tell you to fuck off? We can all agree that when urgency is met with hostility, conflicts happen. 

It'd be easier if people agreed, but what is there to do?"
TrueOffMyChest,fcuhzvp,t1_fcugpo1,1577981416.0,"Not necessarely, I understand them to a degree. Seeing the world burn down while people don't care and don't change is maddening, the method they use might be uncomfortable to some and feel evil, but I doubt these people have much interests besides what feels right.

Reacting with hostility is understandable, as i did in the past, but people have to look past this and accept what message they convey, or a part of it.

It's not like avoiding animal products is a death sentence, that mild discomfort is better than suffering in the future that could be caused by non willingness to change. 

Sorry if I'm rambling, but I understand these people and their frustration, even if the message and hostility can be overwhelming in my mind it is somewhat justified"
environment,fcub4gr,t1_fcuaz2f,1577976851.0,"As always, doing both is a plus. But going radical and doing what should be done will only fuel their anti ecology messages and hurt the mouvement. For now that is"
TrueOffMyChest,fcu1qgf,t1_fcu1ktu,1577969658.0,"They can do both, I try my best to limit my impact and I tell others to do the same"
TrueOffMyChest,fctymll,t1_fctygj8,1577966011.0,"Yeah, but things are going through the roof because they don't wanna make these changes.
It's an easy way out to point at the dude eating 20 steaks and 5 hams per day, who drives a truck and buys all kinds of shit to justify not doing enough yourself. That's what got us into this mess. It's not about being holier than thou, it's about doing your best to ensure that we survive the next few decades. 

Shifting blame is easy, taking blame and acting on it is harder"
TrueOffMyChest,fcty9x1,t1_fcty80l,1577965550.0,Why not both though? I'm in a place where I can do both comfortably and limit my impact as much as possible. Doing one is just laziness
TrueOffMyChest,fctxwpd,t1_fctwjhl,1577965064.0,"That's not a good mindset though. Saying boi it'd be great if people were more careful, all while not being careful and bashing someone who tries his hardest.. That's no good

I see a lot of people saying that it'd be great if people stopped eating meat, all while eating meat themselves for reasons. If everyone thinks like that we're going exctinct soon

I agree that a lot if things contribute, but meat is the easiest to cut"
environment,fctt8t1,t1_fctt7zt,1577958316.0,You're not alone in this fight
environment,fctszbe,t1_fctswig,1577957920.0,"Thing is if everyone stopped consuming useless shit and reduced meat by 90% the future would be brighter, however convincing people to do small sacrifices for the future is uh.. hard 
Holding companies accountable is as hard, if not even harder"
environment,fctrlt5,t1_fctnakz,1577955881.0,It's both though. One cannot exist sith the other
nextfuckinglevel,fcorl9n,t1_fcnbi6p,1577839661.0,"It's pretty well known that investing money into solutions, reducing meat consumption and stopping ceaseless consumption of products (bad aspects of capitalism) would help.

People say to do those things because it's one of the easiest solutions, we probably should do that before considering geo-engineering projects"
patientgamers,fc3enzg,t1_fc1gpyj,1577388127.0,"I did 3 playthroughs with the pistol only because I didn't know how weapons worked, even on insane difficulty
