ThriftStoreHauls,ffc8g87,t3_esth4e,1579793928.0,The swoosh on those aren't right. I imagine they're knockoffs. But 15$ for a pair of shoes isn't bad.
relationships,ffc3l0w,t3_esi3wt,1579790687.0,"My husband and I have friends that are eclectic. She paints, he works in IT. Their house is filled with all their neat interests. The stairs are painted to look like books, the bathroom looks like the inside of a divers helmet, cool bric-a-brac everywhere.

They're in their late 40s and their house is so very much them. Don't let your friend stifle who you are. Own it"
politics,ffbxyla,t1_ffaf32k,1579786341.0,And to think that all 3 of the top contenders for president are over 70. All 4 if you count Trump =\
90DayFiance,ff2w8qw,t1_ff2rn82,1579526526.0,"Same. It's also 2020, the internet has been a thing in most American homes for 20+ years.

""I don't know how technology works"" is no longer a valid excuse."
wholesomememes,ff1mbf4,t1_ff1j703,1579481543.0,Yeah. I don't think my husband realizes how important it is for me to be seen or heard.
wholesomememes,ff1i51j,t1_ff1hmby,1579479589.0,"I understand that. I just rarely talk to him now because he seems disinterested or not paying attention to anything I say. I used to be extroverted and still am at work. But at home he's either playing games or on his phone, so I just sit and be quiet cause I don't want to bother him. 

It's making me sad and lonely. So the comic resonated with me."
wholesomememes,ff19cwu,t1_ff0jfc8,1579476486.0,Same. I'm pretty sure my husband feels the same as the father =(

I'm done."
90DayFiance,ff15n3r,t1_fezf6r6,1579475484.0,Christmas is 12 days long. From Dec 25 to Jan 6. Only in the US do I see people screaming about how the entire month of December is Christmas. Every other place I've visited they celebrate the actual Christmas season of the 12 days. So it makes sense that the Christmas trees are still up there.
TumblrInAction,femy2bw,t1_femky6r,1579272563.0,"2008 made the Dems a spectical. It was wild. It's why they chose a reality TV president. 

People like to pretend it was civilized between Barrack and Hillary.

It was wild."
TumblrInAction,femxv55,t1_femns0x,1579272424.0,"Because you watch fox maybe? I see the Mueller report mentioned often. The news is so hectic the last 4 years that often times, other things take precedence."

90DayFiance,fedoypk,t3_eogtml,1579016736.0,I used to work with a ton of eastern  European women. They all spoke like Natalie until they started using English more often. When they talked amongst themselves though it was the same mumbly way. Maria did as well.

AskReddit,fdk38u2,t1_fdj6vez,1578494981.0,"Yeah. My name is a more masculine sounding. Men usually portray characters with my name. I don't bother being offended when some sends me something to Mr. I have an acquaintance who also has a masculine name and she flips her shit when it happens. 

Our names aren't commonly female names. It's fine."
AskReddit,fdk128y,t1_fdjbbvf,1578493409.0,"Or we could try our hardest to change a system that discriminates against people with, what we think, are weird names. 

Tbf though, Nevaeh is my least favorite name ever. I hate it. I automatically assume the family is trash or contains at least 1 Karen type personally."
