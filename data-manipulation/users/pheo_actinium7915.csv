In all seriousness, however. I’m also curious about this. I always imagine situations where I won’t be employed for pockets of some extended period of time and I wouldn’t really know what to say at all. “I’m taking a break.”? Is all I can imagine, but that raises even more questions."
relationship_advice,ffdw897,t3_et30vg,1579830469.0,"Talk to her about it. Talk through it. No, she isn’t gross or trashy; don’t take these kinds of comments to heart (this is Reddit we’re talking about here). Some girls tend to be this way and this does not mean they’re trashy or need to “grow up”, there might be some inclination for her to act that way and the desire to feel wanted by you even more. You mentioned that you’re not a jealous person, and she may be someone who has taken you not being a jealous person as not wanting her as much as she wants you to want her and/or was used to guys she dated being protective/overprotective of her to that extent and desires that. Just try to understand why and communicate with her that you’re not a jealous person. It’s entirely possible that your two personalities aren’t compatible, but that’s not something for me to judge."

teenagers,ff5d87t,t3_erqoq0,1579588038.0,That’s a nice grilled-cheese sandwich you got there. I suggest adding a little more shading on the cheese and more cross-shading on the bread for toasty goodness. Your water coloring is on point though!

teenagers,ff1wwvi,t3_er6nz6,1579488047.0,"Reading your description it definitely is v different. All I see on my feed these days is guys saying they got rejected and stuff like asking for upvotes. Obviously there are some posts that are great and supportive and more than that, but not noticeably among the sea of insta-comment-like posts. Maybe I’m wrong, though."
relationship_advice,ff1w73z,t3_er6lgx,1579487566.0,Please leave him.
relationship_advice,ff1t7pg,t3_er6350,1579485643.0,"Leave it. If that’s what he had the audacity to say whether it be on his own volition or with a girl, that’s it. He’s not worth it. Love can cloud your mind from seeing things objectively, and in this case I’d say that him feeling bad is that he feels bad getting caught, not feeling bad that he said that. Because nobody’s true SO would say that and still claim to love you. Confront him later again after you’ve taken some time to clear your head from what happened , and establish that you’re not willing to be in a relationship with someone who’s half-assed towards you and leave. 
It hurts seeing someone who may very well potentially get her heart broken in the future, so just leave. Because you deserve someone better than someone who thinks (or even says) something along the lines of “you’re not the one”, especially in the presence of another girl.

EDIT: Also considering that he called you a bitch, as well as the fact that you felt the need to have sex with him to help recover the situation, he doesn’t deserve you and doesn’t deserve to have the advantage of sex when you don’t completely feel up for it. The blatant name-calling and words he said to the girl he was talking to was already enough, but you feeling that you need to compensate through sex is a red flag that this isn’t going right at all. He’s the one who should be compensating, if at all since I hope you leave him, not you."

AskReddit,ff1a6ih,t3_er46nt,1579476771.0,"Not directly related and not exactly something that applies to everyone who has low self esteem, but I improved myself. There’s a point in time where your mind has sunk so low in disparaging yourself. You realize that there’s nothing to lose, and realize that nothing comes from wallowing in self pity. I think taking action and starting to make the changes I wanted to see in myself allowed me to gain a great deal of self esteem."
