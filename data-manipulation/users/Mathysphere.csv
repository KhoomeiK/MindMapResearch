blunderyears,ffq5qdx,t1_ffpmard,1580121968.0,Nah. More like it would take more than one hat to be a blunder.
blunderyears,ffp34h8,t3_eufeju,1580085301.0,"Not a blunder. You’re adorable here, just wearing a goofy hat!"
Catswithjobs,ffp2te2,t3_eueq8g,1580085086.0,That cat is CHONKY like the ball.

CFB,ffisrq9,t1_ffinxx9,1579981799.0,Same here :(
snakes,ffgg4y2,t3_etb4f2,1579905470.0,Cornsnakes are downright affectionate when they’re well-treated! So glad to see you gave him some much needed TLC.
thisismylifenow,ffdwiwi,t3_et27no,1579830677.0,That. FACE.
pics,ffd1487,t3_esybuz,1579811349.0,"I remember this, because photographers caught her asleep during this event. Hard to doze off inconspicuously while seated in the front row when you’re, you know, the most famous princess in the world. She was tired because she was pregnant with Prince William, but that hadn’t yet been announced."
Chonkers,ffczlk4,t3_esxfc6,1579810510.0,Looks like the Kool-Aid pitcher getting ready to bust through your door!
fatlogic,ffc059o,t3_esqqw3,1579788116.0,"Other than cancer, these are also all things you could be complimenting if you tell someone she looks great because she *gained* weight, too.  Somehow the fatlogicians never consider that as part of their whole “yo go girl, big girls rule!” attitude."
rarepuppers,ffapd1y,t3_esksgt,1579741353.0,Is it a Kimpton? I try to stay at that chain on business and I looooove it when other customers have their dogs with them.
ADHD,ff7x8dc,t3_erwmd9,1579660516.0,"As someone without hyperactivity who was not diagnosed until age 44 - by a caring and well-informed family doc, no less - I can’t imagine how angry that made you. Just because adults learn to cope doesn’t mean the symptoms and life disruption go away."
ADHD,ff7wvxr,t3_erxddg,1579660280.0,"On my first day of medication, I just wandered around my house, astonished by how QUIET the world had just become. No running commentary and negative self-talk, no intrusive or distracting thoughts. I mean, it was wonderful, but so extreme that the best way I can summarize it is, the voices in my head stopped. It was bizarre in the most positive way.

I think this is my new normal, after 7 years of meds, because now I notice when, due to extreme stress, the racing thoughts start back up. They’re the exception now. I don’t know how I survived 44 of years of that being normal."
ADHD,ff7werx,t3_ery5ye,1579659960.0,"I can stick to a diet with chocolate (my weakness) in the house just by tucking it away in cupboards, or putting anywhere not directly in sight. I’ll forget I have it. I assumed everyone does this (I wasn’t diagnosed until age 44), but apparently not.

I get so much credit for my extensive notes and comments from meetings. People have relied on my notes more than once. No one seems to notice that I can’t remember any details I don’t wrote down. 

I have the cleanest office. Nothing distracting is in my line of sight, and I dust and clean my desk regularly. No one else realizes it’s because I have to remove as many distractions as humanly possible in order to work effectively. They just always compliment how nice my office looks.

ADHD superpowers, y’all."

childfree,ff7jm68,t3_es2g07,1579651093.0,"Some places get it when it’s on your chart, thankfully. I had outpatient surgery this past year. I’m 51, in menopause, have never been pregnant, and have had two procedures that prevent pregnancy. The pre-op nurse waved a pee cup nonchalantly in my general direction and said “You don’t need this, right? Right.”"

It’s a slammogram, and we all deal with because we’re all lucky enough to be living in an era where advanced tech means we all know breast cancer SURVIVORS now. And you want to argue with the techs and reduce the accuracy of the test? C’mon."

funny,ff6iqjh,t3_erxe5m,1579628066.0,"You just forgot Rule 1 for brilliant scientific creators and inventors, ie, Secure the Cat Somewhere Else First. Also applies to recording readings, wrapping gifts, organizing papers, etc."

Scams,feo6cci,t3_eq50u4,1579295741.0,Whoa. There’s a Tinder *Plus?* I’m a boring middle-aged lady who’s never even been on regular Tinder. What does the “plus” get you?

ADHD,fefavcm,t3_eouitg,1579052259.0,This right here is why the timer app is what I use the most on my Apple Watch. I routinely let water boil away and forget to put eggs in the pot. Timer for 8 minutes - check that water is boiling. Timer for 12 minutes to actually boil the eggs.

TumblrInAction,feecgbs,t3_eooroy,1579030898.0,"This is what I hate about this collective, reductionist thinking. Anyone thinking Steven King had it easy “from the start” because of his race, sexuality or gender has no clue how he actually got started, using his experience as a janitor to write a novel on a deeply weird topic in a marginalized genre that he assumed was so worthless he threw his draft away. “Carrie” only exists because his wife fished the draft out of the trash and liked it. He was dirt poor at the time, teaching high school, and his penchant for very creepy horror, often written from a female point of view, guaranteed him NOTHING in terms of success. It’s a shame he didn’t stick to his original statement here and ended up walking it back a little on Twitter."
