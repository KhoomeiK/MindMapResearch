Unexpected,femzwr8,t3_epwyos,1579273829.0,"My grandfather passed away in his sleep on New Years Day when I was in elementary school. In 2018, it was the 10 year anniversary of his death. When we visited the grave, a pitbull showed up and stood with us for a bit. It didn’t have a collar or anything. Then it ran away and disappeared behind some graves in the distance. 2018 was the year of the dog, and pit bulls were his favorite breed. Some even said that he kind of looked like one."

AskWomen,fegtgyn,t3_eoy958,1579102156.0,"We were in the same friend circle but never really talked. Then when we were looking for a housemate, we asked him and he moved in. Our other housemates weren’t around much so we were always together especially at night. We realized how we have the same interests and similar personality (in terms of being more chill). We ended up watching a TON of movies together. I showed him a Ghibli movie that I love and he ended up loving it too. That was when he realized he liked me. From then on, he made it pretty obvious and was upfront about it. He said he wanted to kiss me, but would only do it when I wanted him to. He was there for me and I was there for him. He was my first kiss. We’re still dating now."

AskReddit,fdr3vje,t3_emudq5,1578679176.0,"1. Keep all your liquids (that abide by TSA laws) in a clear ziploc bag so it’s easier to take out when going through security check. Also keep your electronics in one place too.

2. Wear comfortable shoes that you can easily put on and take off (with socks). Dress comfortably, always bring a sweater/sweatshirt with you because plane temperature can fluctuate. 

3. Buy some snacks, download videos to watch on your devices, keep hand sanitizer on you at all times.
