news,fgsw2vd,t1_fgsomb1,1581093855.0,"elaborate. from what i understand the main issue of dirty cops is not merely because they take things too far and abuse their power but those who do rarely get punished so whatever bad apples that ruin the system stay and continue to ruin said system.

and they rarely get punished because either unions or tough on crime politicians have given the police justifications and exceptions and whatnot that basically say the obvious crimes the dirty cops committed were not crimes by virtue of being cops. 

every cop who shoots an unarmed perp feared for their life, every cop that seizes ""suspiciously"" large amounts of cash did so for police business, every cop who roughs up someone in their custody was a dirty rotten criminal who got what's coming ect you get the idea. 

there are cases where these actions are justified (whole reason they were allowed in the first place after all) : assailants with weapons can not just kill the cop but others hence use of deadly force, asset forfeiture was written to keep drug lords and mafia bosses from continuing business when in jail, uncooperative and hostile perps require stronger submission ect.  but like everything in this world people like to stretch the letter of the law and ignore the spirit of the law so they can use them as excuses rather than justifications.  the core of all corruption.

so my logic is that since these problems come from bad apples abusing their special privileges we have dire consequences for abusing said privileges.  

the cop that punches a perp when a tackle was an appropriate action did so because they didnt get carried away but was hoping to hurt a person, the cop that spews gunfire into a crowd in hopes of taking out a school shooter is treated as wanting to just kill someone if there is just light cllateral damage, a cop who demands a driver to step out of their car to merely show ID was not an idiot who doesnt know protocol but an authoritarian who wanted to trample constitutional rights ect.  basically a strict standard that states being careless about protocol and procedure is no different from going rogue and abusing power. 

hopefully, it would encourage cops to go by the book and ensure each action is appropriate if unfortunate and basically earn those privileges.  great power comes with great responsibility because there are great consequences for not taking responsibility.

the only problem I can see is how to enforce these new standards.  and the greatest irony is that if the cops already enforced the current standards instead of being lenient or throwing them away we wouldn't need these extreme standards that will just be abused even further."

KotakuInAction,fgj2wgs,t1_fgj2sh8,1580835956.0,Will try to find it. I think Sargon posted it on his channel again fully monetized.
KotakuInAction,fgj1yox,t1_fgj1oun,1580835449.0,Oh the origin nal video Sargon was sued over was a collection of video clips that showed Akila's double speak. One clip shows her supporting a thing and the next clip eschewing the same thing.  That's the hypocracy I was talking about.
KotakuInAction,fgj1bab,t3_eyriqs,1580835089.0,what presidence does this set? can anti-SJWs now show off SJW hypocrisy?

Not so forbidden a snack then eh?

Like I think in the Manga Alita was a literal toy of sorts,an autonomous doll to house a daughter's brain so of course the artificial construct would have deliberate design such as cuter doll eyes."
KotakuInAction,fgi9pu1,t1_fggasve,1580812999.0,"I wanna say there's degrees of separation or something and SJWs tend to go to the extremes of getting the most harmful punishments for the harmless of crimes.

I'm reminded of that first lesbian cake issue where that couple had three other bakeries perform the task and they simply moved on to another bakery until they found the one bigot.

The fact a number of bakeries did their request before they found the bigoted one is proof that they weren't being discriminated against and bigoted Baker was the one being opressed."

KotakuInAction,fgi8p6n,t3_eymufq,1580811468.0,"Why couldn't they have just used the generic super AI every dystopia had?

Hell if they were really anti fascists they could have gone deiselpunk and had them travel back to Nazi Germany where hitlser was mutilating concentration camp prisoners to be a skynet esque superbrain. Or explained how Nazi Germany came to be because of Nazi superscience tricking the people or some bullshit like that.

So many pulp fictions use stupid jetpack Hitler for their premises and even worked in Cthulhu by way of the Thule society from Indiana Jones to Hellboy.

These wokesters are so blinded by their idiology they couldn't even use the most common way to appeal those politics. Everyone loves a good ol' Nazi fighting story. Even Tarentino did Inglourous Basterds.

Fuck they could have even used the No Facsists allowed warning as a cute tongue in cheek meta commentary claiming by virtue of buying a game all about fighting Facsists you are de facto not a fascist otherwise you wouldn't buy the game.

I'd be laughing if I wasn't so saddened by these missed oppurtonties."
KotakuInAction,fgi7se4,t1_fghbmjs,1580810080.0,Is there a site or something that does that half and half typing for you? Pop in your text and it capitalizes every other letter.
KotakuInAction,fgi7o5x,t1_fghmtee,1580809899.0,"I think it's cuz they worked damn hard to integrate said politics into the plot and premise as well as make it fit the context of the world.

Like Abe's Odyssey was all about conservation and a touch of human rights but you just see a hapless janitor turning savior because the bad guys were willing to throw him and his friends into the grinder after they threw everything else down there too.

Also helps that lorne panning and gamg were master storytellers and worldbuilders who even planned out plausible biology for the world.

With the politics built as the foundation and the aethetics functionality and appeal built upon it you can't help but not notice until you dig deep.


I wanna say Doug TenNapel's Neverhood had a similar design only instead of Eco politics it's biblical Genesis."
