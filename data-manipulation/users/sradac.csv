I sometimes wonder if they realize as a streamer they have more eyes on them on a daily basis than those A list celebrities.  It comes with the territory of being in the entertainment business.  You're going to have jealous dummies trying to judge you to feel better about themselves, so don't worry about it.  Worry about what makes you happy."

And some people might think im crazy but I prefered Witcher 1 combat to Witcher 2.  They're both real clunky, but at least parrying was done automatically on dice rolls in the first one to have one less mechanic to worry about."
