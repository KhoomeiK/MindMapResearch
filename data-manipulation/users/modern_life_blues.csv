This event is recorded in a book that was preserved by that same nation for many generations afterwards as sacred history. How was consensus reached for this? If this event never took place, then how and why would a group of people numbering hundreds of thousands preserve this text as its history? Not only that, but this story is preserved in various forms in different texts from different periods and regions. So say in the book of Psalms, there's mentions of the Exodus in various psalms, each one authored by someone else e.g. one is a psalm sung by Heiman (who was a Levite c. 10th century Jerusalem) and another by Eitan the Ezrahite (who seemingly lived earlier and wasn't a Levite). And then in, say, the book of Amos, who was a prophet active in the northern kingdom of Israel in the late 9th century, there are references to the Exodus, but emphasizing only certain aspects of it in Amos' own unique style. Where did they all get the Exodus story from? And there are many more prophets and scribes (many from different periods and different regions of Israel/Judah) retelling the story, each in their own way.

You're missing the point I was making: the Exodus story was the national history of the Hebrews - it wasn't a story about fictional characters. The kingdoms of Israel and Judah were real: hundreds of thousands of people had strong traditions about a splitting of the sea. You need to explain where they got this story from. This isn't some story about a lone man e.g. Jesus transmitted by another lone man. This is a story about an entire nation mentioned countless times in different contexts by different groups. It's not possible to dupe so many people for so long about how they came to be a nation. There are no other examples in history of such a phenomenon.

> Parting a sea

With ionic energy it's possible to manipulate matter. The scripture said that Moses raised his staff and the waters parted. It's seems like the staff had electromagnetic properties, and as Moses was initiated as an Egyptian priest and the Egyptians seemingly had advanced technology it seems like a plausible explanation. The scripture also says that this was done in front of a whole nation and that same nation in its corpus of literature spanning many books over many centuries constantly refers to the event. So to the Hebrews who lived much closer to the time of the event it was very real: It was witnessed by their parents and transmitted from generation to generation, so it's quite audacious to say they were all duped by a vast conspiracy spanning many centuries.

I assume you're talking about Elijah? Again, who knows what technologies the prophets had access to. And it's quite audacious to rule out the existence of extraterrestrial beings with advanced technologies coming to visit earth in UFOs. We don't know what's out there. Ask NASA scientists.

> Coming back to life 

If you're talking about the Jesus story then I'm with you as the new testament is clearly an unreliable book, but if you're referring to Elijah's and Elisha's resuscitation of the boys, then just have a look at the scripture: the technical details are given and it seems like they used some form of tantric healing

What evidence are you expecting? If we find aramean/Assyrian written accounts describing the above events then would they have more credibility?

For starters, most of the sites from the era have yet been properly excavated e.g. the Temple Mount, Hebron, Nablus etc. (mainly because Arab invaders \[Muslim conquest and onwards\] who eventually settled those cities simply built over whatever ruins remained and occupy them till this day and moving them out of those sites to make way for thorough excavations would probably involve violence and be a political mess.) 

Regardless, even the sites that archaeologists have access to are only excavated piecemeal over the course of many tens of years, and are yet still peripheral in importance archaeologically speaking e.g. sites like Lachish, Rehov, Meggido, Gezer etc. Furthermore, many wars have been fought in the land of Israel over the course of history (perhaps more than any other country in the world \[battles/km\^2\]) and many of these sites have layers of destruction so that not much actually remains (certainly not written material in the form of parchments and scrolls, which would probably be of the most value archaeologically). 

In fact it's pretty amazing what we do have that remains. For example, we have stelae and inscriptions from the 9th century BCE onwards detailing one to one events known to us from the Bible, using the very same idiosyncratic orthography and grammar of ""Biblical Hebrew"" e.g. Mesha stele, Tel Dan stele, the Siloam inscriptions etc. We also have hundreds of pieces of ceramics and scarabs with Hebrew writing mentioning names and titles known to us only from the Bible e.g. the Lachish letters, the Yavne Yam ostracon, the LMLK seals etc.
