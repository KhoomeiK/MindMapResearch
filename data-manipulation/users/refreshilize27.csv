bulletjournal,ff9kzjs,t1_ff483fl,1579715210.0,The binder and dot pages are the Agenda52 brand from Hobby Lobby! And the sticker pack is from Happy Planner.

I'm literally making a supplies list right now."
Instagramreality,ff0mdqi,t1_ff0hxy9,1579470236.0,"Yeah you right, folds would have been a better choice of word. I got too excited lol."
Instagramreality,ff0lyn5,t1_ff0l9bg,1579470147.0,Yeah......that’s my point. Most other people we see featured on this sub would edit those out as if having skin that moves and folds is a flaw. It’s nice to see some reality.
fatpeoplestories,feps2wp,t1_fepefe4,1579329363.0,"Even then, snacking for a few hours once a month is not going to make your kid obese. Every week would be a concern, but it’s okay to splurge every now and then, especially if everything else you feed them that day is healthy. I think the above comment is asking how frequently you would have to go to these family events."
1200isfineIGUESSugh,fekb1ue,t1_fehcpr2,1579196318.0,"I’m in a similar situation. 22f just moved back in with my parents after graduating college. I used a food scale all last semester for the exact reason above and it helped SO much, I was super happy with my progress! But now being back at home my parents, who themselves are healthy weights, think weighing things on a food scale is too strict/kinda crazy. 

Not sure if it’s a possibility for you, but I will sometimes try to meal prep for myself and weigh everything I can the night before/morning of all at one time, and portion it out for the entire day. This way I only have to get the scale out once a day instead of every time I eat. I can also usually do this while my parents are sleeping/busy/in another room so they don’t make as many comments about it. It’s been working well for me so far. 

Best of luck to you!"

fatlogic,fdhpgmx,t1_fdhp86y,1578427555.0,I agree that it definitely isn’t the most accurate tool! Especially since it doesn’t take body composition into account. But the Olympic swimmer bit is suucchh a stretch.
Instagramreality,fdafhgl,t3_ekcxje,1578245508.0,That looks like the bottom of a white trash can or something to me... the wood isn’t warped it’s just cut off.

safe_food,fcyjyg2,t1_fcxyt07,1578081354.0,Yes! Cuties is the brand name.
safe_food,fcyjx8o,t1_fcwzec0,1578081334.0,"Nope, just one big boi! The slices were each pretty thin."
safe_food,fcyjv5g,t1_fcvmq72,1578081302.0,"Ok this might sound sort of gross but hear me out: I mix 2 parts regular soy sauce with 1 part chipotle aioli and it's DELICIOUS. I'm sure anyone with actual culinary experience would say it's an absolute train wreck because they don't blend together *super* well, but it gives just a little spicy kick to the soy sauce that is phenomenal! Also a good way to enjoy the flavors of the aioli without having to eat it by itself because that shit is super high in calories."
safe_food,fcyjax7,t1_fcwg3hu,1578081006.0,Fujisan is just the brand! You can find it at Sam's Club.
safe_food,fcyj7o3,t1_fcvh9jl,1578080980.0,Thank you both! In my opinion you have to satisfy your eyes just as much as your stomach.
