DungeonsAndDragons,ff1rjso,t1_ff0utqz,1579484600.0,I tried to go digital and somehow paper crept back in and the combo made everything even more chaotic. I think I find something appealing and/or nostalgic about using actual pen and paper for my games and it's been very hard for me to move away from. I just know there has to be a better system than random sheafs of paper that get jumbled with my books and everything else...
