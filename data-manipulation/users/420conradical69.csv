>If you detransition, you'll never be able to get back this body and experience.

But transitioning is what's right for me where I am right now. Even if I detransition, this is the choice that is best for me in my life right now, and I can't imagine regretting a choice that was so beneficial at the time. [Even with that in mind, detransition is extremely unlikely to be something I will have to experience](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6212091/). Nobody can ever know what the future holds, but I know how I feel in the present, and how that indicates my future. I need to follow those feelings

>Transitioning medically will hurt you physically.

Maybe it will hurt me physically. Maybe I will be infertile; maybe I will suffer heart problems - but my mental health is just as, if not more important than my physical health, and many of the ""problems"" that come with medical transition are things that I don't see as problems. I understand that there is danger, but I want to work with a doctor to minimize it. I understand that this might take you a long time to process. It took me a long time to process, too, and I might still be processing it. I had to weigh the pros and cons, though, and I decided that I would rather be a potentially infertile man in a man's body than a depressed and suicidal man in a woman's body, or worse, a dead man in a dead woman's body.

>How will you find love in this transphobic world?

I don't want to love people who won't love me. If they can't accept me for who I am, then I won't regret not being able to gain their affection. It hurts to know there are places I won't be able to travel because of this, and that there are people who I otherwise love that will never associate with me because of this. But if I can't love myself as the man I am, I won't be able to love properly anyway. You love me no matter who I am. That's what matters to me.

>I know it isn't logical, but I'm just worried.

I am too. This is a big change in my life, and one that I might never be able to come back from. But I need to do this to be me, and when you see how much happier and more *me* I am, I know that you'll understand just as well as I do right now.

>I feel like I've lost a daughter.

I can't begin to understand how that must feel, but I feel a sense of loss in this too. I feel like I've lost a childhood and an identity. But I'm a butterfly losing my cocoon. I've lost something but what I'm gaining is so, so important. This is a loss we can work through together.

These are some of the thought processes I went through when I was trying to talk to my mom about this (I'm only 15, so our experience is probably a tad different). One thing I realized is that the longer I spent transitioning, the happier I got. She saw that, and now she realizes fully that this is what's right for me.

Best of luck :)"

This conflates gender and sex. Gender is defined by your neurological sex/the way your brain is structured. Sex is how your body is structured. Transgender people, despite the name, don't change gender - they change their body to more closely match the looks of the sex that their brain structure  indicates they should be. That's the running theory and the most reasonable one, IMO.

Because it is likely neurological, this wouldn't work. Just like you can't get rid of autism through talk-therapy, or a broken leg, you can't get rid of dysphoria - things like anxiety can be helped through therapy because they often have a lot to do with trauma and developed behaviors, but things that are completely neurological only require acceptance and love."

Well, hormone blockers aren't meant to stop dysphoria, they're meant to stop puberty from progressing. Puberty, in genuinely dysphoric people, only elevates dysphoria.

>This means that if you give hormones to a dysphoric child, you are locking him or her into that state of dysphoria permanently.

This may be correct, at least in cases where the child doesn't go through the correct measures of diagnosis (IMO a year in therapy and living as the gender they are transitioning towards). But it doesn't have anything to do with HRT or affirming surgeries, either.

> I am most concerned about children whose lived are ruined by parents who want to be ""woke"" and allow them to make huge decisions about their sexual future before they've even learned about it in school. 

As a transsexual, I completely fucking agree. Nuff said.

> To my understanding, it doesn't work on adults, either. Suicide rates don't change before versus after surgery or hormones. 

I can say that with HRT, my suicidal urges have significantly decreased and it has been the same for every single (\~200) dysphoric trans person I know.  
[The study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885) also doesn't support that claim: it does say that suicide rates don't change/increase after surgery, but it says nothing about that meaning they shouldn't be performed. It says verbatim ""Our findings suggest that sex reassignment, although alleviating gender dysphoria, may not suffice as treatment for transsexualism, and should inspire improved psychiatric and somatic care after sex reassignment for this patient group."" which implies that the ideal treatment would be surgery with continued therapuetic treatment after.  


 A survey of trans people in the UK found that a completed medical transition was shown to greatly reduce rates of suicidal ideation and attempts, in contrast to those at other stages of transition (imminently transitioning or beginning transition). 67% of transitioning people thought about suicide pre-transition and only 3% post-transition (Bailey et al., 2014).  (From [https://www.suicideinfo.ca/resource/transgender-people-suicide/](https://www.suicideinfo.ca/resource/transgender-people-suicide/) )

It's also important to consider that suicide rates are always going to be higher in oppressed groups. I know I've had more suicidal thoughts after interacting with people who don't want me to transition. It's a daunting thing to face people who think that the only thing saving your life is something they need to take away to ""save you"" - it's something that saddens me and really depresses me. That's not a statistic, but it's my experience.  


&#x200B;

> If it is not cured by therapy, I am reluctant to believe that major surgery or taking drugs that will cause severe and permanent changed to the body will help an already unstable mental state. 

The problem is that you can't change my brain structure with therapy, but you CAN change my body to match my brain structure through surgeries. Chemotherapy for cancer patients also causes severe changes to the body, but without it, many people would die. I see it the same way for transgender people. I know I would be dead if I hadn't transitioned. All I want is to live my life as male, and that's what I'm doing, and it makes me feel more like myself than I ever did before I transitioned. 

TL;DR: Don't force kids to do anything, at least a year of living as your gender and therapy please, diagnose shit accurately, and let adults do what they need to do."

No, no he's not, nor is anyone. I'm not accountable for my medical condition. I don't choose what triggers it and I didn't choose to have it. I'm not accountable for my OCD's intrusive thoughts, my autism's hyperfixations, or my ADHD's easy distractability, and in the same way I refuse to be held accountable for dysphoria.

I agree with the rest of your comment to an extent but like, please don't tell people they're responsible for what makes them dysphoric. Posting uncensored pictures of body parts that make so many trans men dysphoric in trans male spaces is just asking to trigger people, and that's not the viewer's fault when they can't filter out that content easily."

truscum,fd7k1u6,t3_ek8dwn,1578205721.0,"Tucutes and truscum have a lot more in common than some people would like to think - the biggest different between moderates of both groups is that one side, at its core, defines ""clinically significant distress"" as undue suffering (tucutes), and the other defines it as ""any distress noticeable by a medical professional"" (truscum).

The thing that sets the biggest groups of tucutes and truscum apart on *Reddit*, though, is the tucute subs' inability to recognize what transmedicalism actually IS. Whereas r/truscum tend to believe what I noted above, that our core beliefs  are generally rather similar but interpreted in more radical ways by the other side, the big tucute subs tend to believe that transmeds/truscum are ""enby-hating Nazi TERF bigots"".

TL;DR: Our labels aren't really the defining factor, it's our actions, and the actions of people on some of the biggest trans subreddits right now are absolutely unacceptable and hypocritical: it can't be right to accuse one group of gatekeeping and then gatekeep that group from support, memes, and community."
