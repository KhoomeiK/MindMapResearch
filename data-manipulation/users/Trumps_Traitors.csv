TwoXChromosomes,ffavuep,t1_ffao05y,1579745675.0,"Hmm, id like to debate this and say that breasts are sexual for a few reasons. A, they are quite sensitive to stimulation, particularly when aroused. B, they are fatty deposits and fatty deposits arouse (straight) men because they signal reproductive readiness and physical health. Its why we also like big butts and hips. The shift in puberty that women go through, wherin they start to store fat in these places primarily is a direct attempt to show off that you are physically ready and able to mate. I'd say they are as sexual as the vagina is, considering that ""sex"" is much more than just vaginal intercourse in humans.
