We had a two year old living with us, what if for some reason they had gotten ahold of one? Anyways, long story short, he was out cleaning them up within 30 minutes.

WatchPeopleDieInside,fffs54r,t1_fffb9gj,1579890612.0,"I'm sorry, but people are allowed to feel the feelings that they feel. You may not find this hurtful, but I would. Everyone's feelings are valid. I'm supposed to feel safe and taken care of around my friends. Yeah we joke around and pull pranks, but this would cross the line for me. Spraying me with a water gun out of nowhere would be one thing, but abandoning me on a train, who knows what time of night? Fuck no. Who are you to call me weak? I am stronger than you could ever imagine, and if I didn't cry, I wouldn't have been able to make it through everything I have. Not being allowed to cry is such an old fashioned way of looking at things. I'm sorry to rant like this but when it comes to people's feelings, am truly an advocate to let people feel how they feel, without judging them."
