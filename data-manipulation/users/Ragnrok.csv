Both movies have the protagonist off in the background training with some crazy/grumpy old man until they fly off near the end to attempt to help their friends but ultimately accomplish very little beyond getting into cool fight.  So the side plots are pretty much the same.  

Let's look at the main plots.  The good guys fleeing a planet into space as they get found and attacked by the bad guys?  Check.  Then we have the good guys going into space and running from the bad guys for a while.  One movie has a game of cat and mouse, while the other has what is essentially an ultramarathon, only in space, only more deadly and less entertaining.  

The main difference is that in Empire the spaceship game of hide and seek eventually ends and we get a bunch of Cloud City shenanigans, while the TLJ chase sequence doesn't end until the rebels make their final stand.  Also something involving a casino that even most fans of the movie agree was a waste of everyone's time.
