This is how toxic some of you are about it. Like you have to be a dick instead of just having a civil conversation. I never attacked you personally, so stop acting like I did.

You know you can't just turn pvp flag on PvE and make that work. That means every fight is started on somebody else's terms. That's terrible too."
classicwow,ffjrqvj,t3_etlgmf,1580005180.0,"The mentality of some of the commentors here is ludicrous. Is it so bad to enjoy PvP but not enjoy griefing?

I personally WANT to play on PvP servers. I like the idea of having to stay alert and be ready for a fight with some people my level and then moving on. But I don't play on them because of the BS the OP is talking about. It's sad that there's no middle ground. PvP should be fun for both sides. Even losers."

As for the driver not stopping... I think we should be glad they didn't slam on the breaks as some might instinctively do.

Of course the car is still at fault because I don't think that was a legal area to enter the HOV lane, and it was hard to tell but no blinker was used either."

I try to be empathetic when possible. Somebody cuts me off in traffic, maybe they have a real emergency. Somebody is rude to me at work, maybe they're having a shitty day. It's hard to imagine what people could be going through.

But this? I can't even begin to show empathy. A person begging for money would be lucky to get a 5. A 20 is a tremendous gift and to respond this way has no possible excuse. This person should not even exist, because clearly they comprise nothing more than pure concentrated detriment to society."

But most people refuse to buy paid mobile games. ""Why buy them when there are so many free ones?"" they ask.

You can blame the developers all you want, but game designers deserve to be compensated for their work. Asking for payment up front just *doesn't work* and the only ones to blame are the consumers.

I personally would like to see a shift to the paid model, but I understand I'm a minority and why it's just not feasible to expect it of most developers who actually want to earn money."

And the analogy is fine. This is an _annual_ event. You're likely to buy a few games every year for that PS4 too. It's not just a one time expense. People (who aren't considered wealthy) spend this much money on video game related costs every year, easily.

And as somebody who has hosted for extended families and handles the shopping for a family of 6, your 350 dollar estimate is over. There's a lot of cheap, but tasty, stuff on that table. And if you know where to get it, cheese can be very affordable."

food,fcuvkct,t1_fcu6d8y,1577989428.0,"Looking at the table, a lot of it looks pretty affordable. A lot of that can be purchased cheap. When you're hosting a party for 30 family members, this is just a thing you might like to do. It's not a *daily* affair, it's a *special* occasion. Maybe multiple people pitched in (I'm sure more than one had to help set it up). Maybe you cut back the gift budget to afford it.

It's food for a lot of people. Everybody eats, and this isn't any different nor more expensive than a typical meal.

Do you comment ""rich people things"" whenever someone buys a PS4? Because this would easily be cheaper than that. It's about what your personal priorities are."

It's possible that he's posting more videos simply to recoup his costs so he can continue being philanthropic. He doesn't strike me as someone who is elevating himself above others, but I don't know him off-camera. I only know he's charitable and an entertainer. He does it for a job (we all have to make a living) and he seems to enjoy what he does, and what he does *requires* posting videos. The larger scale allows for larger giveaways. He could tone down his videos, but they would not be nearly as viral if he did, and being viral makes the money he needs. He has to be over-the-top. It's his brand. It's not really optional."
unpopularopinion,fckg98d,t3_ehnsu3,1577724651.0,"Talking about how great they are detracts from their own personal glory. It does *not* detract from the deed itself. If I run into a burning building, save 5 people, then post about it on social media, those 5 lives are still saved. The deed itself remains as it was. But boasting about it exposes qualities about my *character* that are less than flattering.

I don't think it's necessarily a 1 to 1 trade-off. If we judge character on a point system, I'd say the huge real personal risk to save the lives far outweighs the minor brag. Now if we demand a parade be held in our honor, that's a bit worse. It's not all or nothing."
