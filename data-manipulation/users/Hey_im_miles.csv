What you're doing is making up quotes and putting your own meaning into it.
>
>He said there were ""very fine people on both sides"" when one side was exclusively Nazis because anyone who would march side by side with obvious Nazis *is* a Nazi then he called some Nazis fine people. This isn't a difficult chain of events to follow, I already spelled it out once for you..  
.

I thought one side didnt want statues removed, there were nazis among them. They weren't all nazis even if you disagree with them. 
>
>If you balk at the idea that marching side by side with the ""Jews will not replace us"" brigade makes one a Nazi then you are lost..  
.

If you are there to chant ""Jews will not replace us"" then theres a good chance you're a nazi. If you're there to protest the removal of a statue and people next to you are chanting ""Jews will not replace us"" that doesnt necessarily make you a nazi."
