Gonna keep soaking up the info around here. Thanks for the response!"
benzorecovery,ffybmo1,t1_ffwi8hq,1580342572.0,"I agree with the encouragement for OP to just dispose of the pills. 

I’ve been off and on benzodiazepines for a decade. I take them maybe 14 days out of each month now just due to supply. I’ve never experienced withdrawal so this sub is really interesting and I’m here to educate myself. I’ve def binged on them before; you know, like taking 7x my dose. Honestly I can hardly tell the difference between when I’m off or on them? So maybe because they hardly do anything noticeable for me, I don’t get the withdrawal? This whole anti-benzo thing is really growing lately, so I’ve been thinking about it a lot and wondering if I’m even getting what I should be out of other medications because of it. 

I feel like there must just be a mystical hole on the inside of my throat where meds disappear to, escaping effective absorption. 

Anyway. Sorry for the random self-absorbed comment."

cripplingalcoholism,ffjgj93,t3_etrmgq,1579997771.0,"Alcohol withdrawal can cause or increase REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, a parasomnia. I’d give that a google."
cripplingalcoholism,ffjfyvq,t1_ffi955t,1579997437.0,"I have a parasomnia called REM Sleep Behavior Disorder which causes yelling screaming hitting and nightmares. One cause for it is alcohol withdrawal (mine is due to brain injury though). And it’s medicated with clonopin, so I imagine Xanax would do the trick as well."
Cringetopia,ffjbq0y,t1_ffhuzkv,1579994948.0,Hansen did basically a series (?) on this guy. It can be found on YouTube. I only got through like one video of it because I found it boring.
PublicFreakout,ffj5054,t1_ffiu4zn,1579990550.0,"Vyvanse and vodka are two of my favorite things, and my first thought seeing this video was also “someone order that woman some Xanax stat”."
EntitledPeople,fdzvoql,t1_fdvkda0,1578796907.0,"Well, I grew up in the south US and my maid raised me until I was 13 cause my mother couldn’t be bothered to. So, to each his own."
LifeProTips,fdkbx2k,t1_fdj1q9b,1578500621.0,I’m glad you’ve found a way through it.

insaneparents,fdj7n9g,t1_fdimt6e,1578460755.0,Do y’all all know each other in this sub?
LifeProTips,fdj0lxn,t1_fdidete,1578455409.0,"Your mom must have a lot of other redeeming qualities if you still let her do that. My mother did that to me with extended family until I was 26 and cut her off. At least for me, it was a disgusting public humiliation each time. I finally lost my shit the last time and hyperventilated for nearly an hour after. Never again."
LifeProTips,fdizg6s,t1_fdinqaw,1578454608.0,My mother was still pulling this shit with me until I was 26 and cut communication with her. Embarrassing me in front of the entire family like that. People are gross.
TrueOffMyChest,fdhnltv,t1_fdh68fd,1578426450.0,"He’s done his damage. No going back. Time to grieve. 

I can relate with this too much. Don’t count on him for anything. When it was moving time for me, my leech didn’t even help with the packing. He showed up for ten minutes to scoop his stuff up and put them it in his truck and left, just telling me vaguely he was going to go stay at his friends place. I was left alone packing with movers until I turned in the keys. 

Don’t expect any final bit of decency or motivation from him. Don’t expect anything. Expectations lead to disappointment."
HumansAreMetal,fdgwtlb,t1_fdge295,1578410278.0,They might’ve tried that kind of stuff already. Sounds like they’ve found a peaceful existence for now.
DoesAnybodyElse,fdg1gbp,t3_el3hkq,1578376537.0,"Sort of. I follow and read all kinds of things I don’t agree with, mostly out of morbid curiosity, but I don’t get worked up about it or carry it with me after."
