privacy,ff3ifpq,t3_erf49j,1579541720.0,"To somewhat repeat myself from the similar thread that was posted the other day, the reason why this is only temporary is because that is the compromise that can realistically be implemented on short notice.

The EU is inherently slow and properly creating new regulation that everyone can agree on can take years. With speed that the technology is progressing we obviously can’t wait that long, why they are (hopefully) pulling the emergency brake on it to have enough time to manage it."

assholedesign,fexteme,t1_fexmzlb,1579435725.0,"UPS is a big battery you generally connect to a computer or server so that it can continue to run even if the power goes out.

APC is a large producer of this product.

In order for the computer to know how much battery is left in the UPS you need to connect it with a USB cable.

APC however forces you to use a proprietary USB to RJ-50 cable for literally no other reason than to force you to buy the ridiculously expensive cable from them.

APC are arseholes."
privacy,feneub5,t3_eq056k,1579283169.0,"Good. The process of creating new EU directives and regulations is inherently very slow that can take years to complete, so I absolutely welcome that they immediately pull the brakes on this before it escalates.

As always this is a compromise, but I think this is pretty much the best one could realistically hope for on such relatively short notice."

teslamotors,fdvn8bf,t1_fdvg019,1578749338.0,"Maybe, maybe not. There are however no actual guarantees that anything that isn't already available will ever be included in the current cars.

Smart Summon was for example literally sold in 2015 as a HW1 feature (even more, the car was supposed to be able to park itself at Superchargers). That together with most other promised self-driving features was later quietly dropped when HW2 was released.

Snippet from the original Autopilot page:

>**Autopilot Parking**  
Model S helps you find a parking spot and automatically parks in it. In the city, it will notify you when it finds a parallel parking spot, then control steering, acceleration and deceleration to back smoothly into it. When approaching a Supercharger station, Model S automatically parks in an open stall. Model S will even park itself in your garage at home.

>With calendar syncing enabled, Model S checks current traffic conditions to determine how much time is needed to make your first meeting of the day. At the right time, it turns on the climate control and opens the garage door. On private property, Model S will even pull out of the garage and meet you at the curb."

So to clarify, like my mockup shows, the idea would rather be to include averages and highscores **in addition** to the current totals. I see no need to remove any of the functionality that already exists, but rather adding more data to make the relics more interesting.

While I hadn't really thought about it, the in game message that pops up over your hero could probably also trigger  when you for example beat your current best (dunno about average, might be too spammy)."
TrueDoTA2,fdqxawn,t1_fdqj2zp,1578676104.0,"Often, it's also so obvious that they are just frantically looking for anything or anyone to blame their own mistakes on, like they might as well be pinging abilities at random.

To push that metaphor a little further, the guy didn't want a professional carpenter, he needed someone who can use a hammer, screwdriver and paintbrush to fix his fence.

No, he didn't exactly use the most elegant or even correct wording, but I feel people here are overreacting."
softwaregore,fdnk4gf,t1_fdnhd5z,1578587480.0,"Yes, in writing, but you would never actually pronounce the colon. 

Since saying ""twenty twenty-one"" is ambiguous without context, Siri naturally assumes you are talking about time since that is what's most common. If you want to ask about the year 2021, then you need explicitly ask her that, e.g. ""how long until *year* 2021"".

Arguably the only real issue here is that both ""twenty twenty-one"" and ""two thousand twenty-one"" will be converted to ""2021"" and parsed as time, but where the latter one should maybe instead be parsed as year or even querying the user to clarify."

TrueDoTA2,fcrhvgn,t3_eijyce,1577902025.0,"Like other have said, Wyvern is a good hero, but arguably among the least beginner friendly support heroes you can pick. 

Compared to most other heroes in the game, she's one of the few who can actively harm your own team if played incorrectly. 

If you play with friends, then this probably won't matter much, but if you're playing solo, then prepare to get flamed a bunch when you screw up. Though if you feel that you can take that (the mute button is your friend!), then absolutely go for it. It's a fun hero that you can do really cool plays with if handled properly.

Otherwise, I'd suggest for example trying out Jakiro which is an incredibly strong and stable support hero that works well in essentially all brackets. Coming from LoL he might also provide a crash course in getting a feel for the slower turn rate in Dota since most of his skills are ground targeted and have unusually long cast times."

In fact, if you aren't building a password manager I can't imagine there are any legit reasons whatsoever for two-way encrypting your customers passwords. They would be spending time and resources on building something that is non-standard and significantly less secure for no sane reason.

At best it's some CS student trying to be clever, at worst it's someone doing something even worse with your password than someone storing it in plain text because they didn't know better."
DotA2,fcbnx4c,t3_egulcj,1577589018.0,"Much about Dota is about trying to anticipate what your opponents are going to do and positioning yourself accordingly. Often when one gets jumped and obliterated, it's generally because you were somewhere you shouldn't be.

Map awareness as much about knowing where the enemy is, as it is about knowing where the enemy isn't.

If you can't see the enemy and if you don't have perfect vision around you, you need to try to imagine the possible ways they might jump on you and position yourself appropriately. Do they have a Mirana or Pudge? Make sure there are creeps between you and where they might be coming from. Do they have blink heroes? Stand far away from your blind spots. The minimap is important here, but you also need to position your camera such that you can see when they are coming. 

You should generally also keep yourself moving. After the laning phase, don't just stay in the same lane alone. Every time you show yourself you're opening yourself up to ganks. The longer you stay there, the more likely it becomes that they are going to rotate on you.

When you do see the enemy, even briefly, try to note what they're doing and imagine where they are going next. Are they grouping up and moving towards a lane? Then they're probably pushing so you should likely be safe to farm in the opposite lane for a while. Did their creeps suddenly arrive at the tower without them? They might be rotating to gank you!

Overall, this is arguably the most difficult and maybe most critical part of Dota."
