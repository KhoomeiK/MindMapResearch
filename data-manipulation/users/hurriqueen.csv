aww,ffpdrxw,t1_ffm93lu,1580092520.0,"My girlfriend and I don't have a fenced in yard either, and we don't go to dog parks (after being attacked twice by little dogs with irresponsible owners we just didn't feel safe).  What we did was get super-long sturdy retractable leashes (like 30+ feet extension, do a 60+foot run from one end to the other), go to an open space (backyard, field, etc) and let them run!  It's not as perfect as a fenced in run, but we get lots of good zooms and games of fetch in, and they always get suitably tired out.  The line being retractable keeps them from getting tangled up (though our two girls don't run at the same time).

When we adopted our second, the rescue said that they usually like to see a fenced in backyard, but that it's not a deal-breaker at all.  Even just between walks and indoor zooms you could be good.  The most important thing is being an owner who cares and will take care of them.

If you have the love and energy and space in your home for a dog, especially a rescue, it's a wonderful thing that can bring great joy to both of your lives :)

Good luck with whatever you end up doing!"

weddingshaming,ffoh2fz,t1_fflvlb9,1580077575.0,"I'm an aspirin baby!  My mom kept miscarrying, until the doc told her to take 1 baby aspirin a day.  The next pregnancy was me!  At the time it was an unknown thing, but her case ended up being cited in a medical study that led to this being a more commonly-known, low-risk treatment attempt.  I wish I knew more (the condition has a name apparently, and caused no symptoms outside of the miscarriages), but I last talked to her about it many years ago."

Sometimes I look at their scars, mostly faded by now, or their early pictures, and get sad thinking about their lives before... but then they squish into bed with me or do zoomies or give kisses and I know they feel completely safe and at home.  It's an amazing feeling."

tumblr,fffpwat,t1_fffd8ba,1579889227.0,"Eh, instead of it being lies, I prefer to give the benefit of the doubt and assume something small and visually cool happened (the magnets flew a few inches to attach to a very close-by object) and since OP was a kid it was SUPER COOL.  Human memory is much better at retaining emotions than facts, so the kid remembered the magnets doing something SUPER COOL and the event just kinda, idk, scaled with the emotions to something that would be SUPER COOL for an adult to see.

Memory is fascinating.  I know people tell lies on the internet for points etc etc, but there are definitely times where the event couldn't have happened as stated, but it also is a genuine memory.

I prefer thinking it's that."

Clearly this occurrence of magical protection is so extraordinarily rare as to be unknown to the wizarding world, so it would have to take something much more than just putting yourself in danger to help another.

(Also James happened to be wandless, so he had even less choice, but that doesn't seem to be a deciding factor.)"

James was incredibly brave, but he never had a choice, thus it didn't count as a sacrifice in the same way."
