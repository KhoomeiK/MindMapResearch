YouShouldKnow,fef4win,t1_feei3dd,1579048251.0,"I work at an animal shelter, and I would just like to add that we appreciate every single thing donated to us! Unfortunately most shelters won't take pillows because of the down in some of them. Dogs will rip them up and can choke on feathers"
AskReddit,fdtfd8y,t1_fdsrkfp,1578715966.0,I wondered why! I worked at a petsmart years ago too and was always upset that we couldn't donate the food. Sad to know that's the reason. I believe now we do get some donated from both our local petsmart and petco though!
AskReddit,fdqv5mb,t1_fdqkdz4,1578675298.0,I work for an animal shelter and any damaged goods (seriously even just a tiny rip in the bag) they can't sell. So they donate all of them to us and it's always great quality stuff. I will forever love Chewy!

YouShouldKnow,fdl4mjk,t1_fdl40iq,1578516966.0,"I will be totally honest, I don't fully know. I work at an animal shelter and I've been told by the vet staff that lavender isn't good for cats, but I also can't find anything on that topic. I personally stay away from it just to absolutely make sure"
sex,fdkjxkf,t3_elqnwe,1578505209.0,"Be honest and tell her. I personally have no sense of smell, so I rely on my husband to tell me if I smell bad. She may be like me and get a little huffy about it (I personally hate water) but all in all hygiene is important."

For anyone interested, this goes over which ones are toxic and the signs to look out for"
YouShouldKnow,fdiybct,t3_elhqn4,1578453831.0,"Also essential oil diffusers! A lot of scents  (lavender, cinnamon, tea tree, ect) are actually toxic to cats"
WhatsWrongWithYourCat,fc7138w,t1_fc6s478,1577494716.0,Ah that makes sense. Cats can never make anything easy for us! Haha
WhatsWrongWithYourCat,fc6g10y,t1_fc68lv8,1577479705.0,Cats are weird. Haha did anything recently change in the home to where she needs a safe space? Do you have an essential oil diffuser at all? Many cats don't like the smells (some are toxic to cats) and so she might be trying to clear the smell with the litter?
WhatsWrongWithYourCat,fc5zja2,t1_fc5wd8v,1577469062.0,This! I work at a shelter and it is concerning when cats use their litter boxes as beds. OP should try to get more cozy hidding spots for kitty if they don't have any or enough for the kitty to feel comfortable
cats,fbk8tof,t1_fbjzyik,1576946551.0,I hope someone as wonderful as you adopts our Leo!
