alberta,ffi5yd7,t1_ffh1vg1,1579965966.0,"Steel and concrete buildings cost a lot more and anything above 6 storeys cannot be constructed from wood (it used to be a limit of 4 storeys until only a couple of years ago). Since China started its rapid expansion the cost of these materials has increased dramatically due to global supply and demand.

Because of the increased building costs, the cost to buy a completed dwelling unit also needs to be higher in order for the developer to make a profit that makes it worth their while to construct the building. In larger cities, like Edmonton and Calgary, housing costs and land costs are high enough that it makes sense to use steel and concrete. In the rest of the province, however housing and land costs are not as high, so it does not make financial sense for a developer to use concrete and steel. In fact, in most situations it would cost more to construct a dwelling unit than you could sell the unit for, so a developer would lose a significant amount of money. That’s why, in the past 30 years or so, there hasn’t been a lot of high rise or even mid-rise construction in Alberta’s mid-sized cities. 

In larger cities you can also sell a dwelling unit for more the closer it is to the City centre, which leads to more concrete and steel (and taller buildings) being more economically viable. In smaller places location isn’t really a factor for apartment housing costs. The impact of this decision will likely lead to taller buildings becoming more viable in more places, like Alberta’s mid-sized cities and suburban areas."
