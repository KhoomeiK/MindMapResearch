Minä tulostin sinne kotiinlähtijöiden lapun, jossa fontti, koko ja layout jäljittelivät virallista lappua mahdollisimman tarkasti. Muissakin lapuissa oli myös lyhyt kuvaus, joten kirjoitin siihen että kotiin voi kävellä, pyöräillä, junailla jne. Lappu täyttyi nimistä hyvin nopeasti, ja siitä saatiin hyvät naurut moneen kertaan.

Just for reference, it's important to understand that the different classification methods mentioned in the presentation reflect the needs of different times. CMYK printing is pretty obvious, because of the way printing works these days. However, when you're painting, you could certainly use CMYK paints and mix them just like a printer. Historically artists used yellow, red and blue to mix other colors and this situation was heavily influenced by the availability of said colors. Making green and purple was difficult before the era of synthetic dyes, so the obvious solution was to mix them from cheap and easily available colors. Nowadays every color you can imagine is available and it's also affordable, so there's no practical reason to stick with the traditional model."
