Nightmares,ffk3pgy,t1_ffjw4wc,1580014857.0,Thanks.  Unfortuntely the testing didn't go well; I have non-operable cancer.
SuicideWatch,ffhbnv2,t1_ffhbjeu,1579929028.0,I am not very experienced in that department and it's beyond me.
SuicideWatch,ffhbcwj,t1_ffhb7es,1579928730.0,"I've spent most of my life without a lover.  Either would be sufficient as long as they truly cared and wanted the best for me.  Something purely online though is  not sufficient, I need someone here to ""mop my brow"" when I'm suffering, or at least to think that they will someday.  I know that sounds greedy but it's what I need."
SuicideWatch,ffhb234,t1_ffhaw2p,1579928442.0,I've spent most of my life looking after my mother.  Now I need someone who wants to look after me.  Someone who truly cares.
SuicideWatch,ffhat6g,t1_ffhapzp,1579928208.0,It would take a minor miracle!
SuicideWatch,ffhaki8,t1_ffha39e,1579927983.0,I am in my 50s
SuicideWatch,ffh9vcm,t1_ffh98dw,1579927349.0,I volunteer at a club for the blind.  It makes me feel better to know I'm helping but it's very much a hollow feeling.  There are other volunteers but mostly all women (I am female).   It's nice and it makes for company but not close friends.
SuicideWatch,ffh8lod,t1_ffh7ugg,1579926229.0,No.  Unless the person I've been speaking to online became a reality which is highly unlikely
SuicideWatch,ffh50q3,t1_ffh4lfu,1579923291.0,"Not really, I have aunts and cousins.  There's someone I've recently been speaking to online who I feel close to. 

There's not a lot in life that I love.  My mother, who died in November, would have been a factor if she'd still been alive.  I spent most of my life looking after her with a couple of (very short term) jobs when she was well enough.  I don't work although I volunteer.  It just feels like I'd be going through a lot of hassle and inconvenience but for what?"
SuicideWatch,ffh3qk2,t1_ffgz16k,1579922293.0,"I have cancer.  Inoperable at the moment.   There is an opportunity for chemo which MAY make it operable and, if so, that could mean I would be in total remission.  The treatment is harsh though."
Ovariancancer,ffdr06f,t1_ffdgotu,1579826824.0,"I had bloating, constipation and nausea stomach wise.  From what I've read though initial symptoms vary significantly, so try not to read too much into it."
Ovariancancer,ffcjz13,t1_ffcie9l,1579801072.0,"Thank you, that's a really good idea!"
Anxiety,ffb3tjk,t1_ffb2yr3,1579751074.0,"Thank you, I was starting to think it was just me."
Anxiety,ff8b1hc,t1_ff8awnp,1579671436.0,Thank you x
Anxiety,ff6tnuo,t3_erzdr0,1579634652.0,"Have you heard of ""Sound Baths"".   If you Google it, it sounds sort of new agey, but the reality is that it's just calming music.  A general selection can be found at https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sound+baths+for+anxiety.  My personal favourite is this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpvNYYKqmaQ

It's got to be worth a try."
Anxiety,ff2g8qv,t1_ff2fkzk,1579504820.0,"Thank you, that is useful"
Anxiety,ff1w1gk,t1_ff1vgfe,1579487461.0,Thank you
Anxiety,ff1ox95,t1_ff1oh8a,1579482927.0,It might not actually kill you but it feels like you're dying.   I do know what you mean though and thanks for responding.
SuicideWatch,ferue3e,t3_eqgy8d,1579358458.0,That would be nice.  I feel the attraction too
Anxiety,feoat0l,t1_femn681,1579297494.0,Thank you but I wouldn't want to take up your time with my silly problems
Anxiety,feml7zq,t1_femhor8,1579261071.0,Thank you but I'm sure what I have to say wouldn't be of interest to you.
Anxiety,feldfvl,t1_fel9p2f,1579219580.0,"Thank you.  

I suppose I am logical and relatively calm.   Looking after mum meant that I couldn't shy away from things that might be distasteful to anyone else, like personal care, I just get on with it.  I am patient and, I hope, kind.  I don't really have any particular skills though."
Anxiety,feld3cl,t1_fekhqyq,1579219347.0,Thanks but I looked after mum because I needed to.  I did my best but am nowhere near a professional level.
Anxiety,feld0o7,t1_fekon17,1579219295.0,Thank you. I spent most of my time looking after mum but I suppose my favourite hobby was doing puzzles (as in puzzle books like crosswords and find the word). I don't know whether I want to be employed or not because I've never experienced it.
