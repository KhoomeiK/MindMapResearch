NoStupidQuestions,fewxvat,t1_fevtjmi,1579421171.0,Sort by new but be ready to see some things you can’t un-see.
vegan,fewwu6d,t1_fewne6j,1579420721.0,I agree. It’s not eating dairy that really makes the improvement. I don’t have acne but I still see a big improvement in my skin.
FloatTank,feg6d9z,t3_eot0xi,1579079072.0,"Before you lie down, wipe the roof of the float with a cloth. Otherwise, 30 minutes later, when your in the zone, a big fat, cold, wet drop will land on your forehead and give you a big fright. (Might have happened to me once or twice!)"
FloatTank,fe6xnsr,t3_eo0apf,1578907324.0,Floating is less about the body and more about the brain. You need to do a few floats to get the hang of it. Keep going.
vegan,fdop7lr,t3_emgwwo,1578609792.0,"I’m Irish too (so yes, 12 cups of tea per day) and vegan. Would you try black tea? The first time I did I loved it and wondered why I hadn’t tried it earlier. Green tea took a long while to get used to but now I love it as much as black and both comfort me. Best of luck!"
NoStupidQuestions,fdl2ix0,t3_elyd4j,1578515959.0,"Cats love to be brushed. It feels like they are being groomed by their moms. Even if a cat has short hair and no need for brushing, it helps to bond you both."
Eyebleach,fdjthkv,t3_elrszz,1578486929.0,"Cows are just like big doggies. Go vegan, everyone."
aww,fdilaa0,t3_elkxlp,1578445428.0,Omg this is so beautiful! Didn’t see it over Christmas though. Where does it come from?
tea,fdfxu0o,t3_el6fpp,1578373217.0,You should consider fixing it. And ideally use the Japanese method. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi
NoStupidQuestions,fd93seb,t3_ekchqq,1578227972.0,"That’s a good point. But the only one I can think of is KFC and they don’t show their ingredients, (or do they?)"
