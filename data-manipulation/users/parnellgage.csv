unpopularopinion,fefb41b,t1_fefagp6,1579052419.0,"Need is necessity to live, not necessity itself. Maybe i'd be taking use of farmers time to collect and send food they'd otherwise throw away, and maybe i'd be wondering how many jet fighters we could do without to fund the usage of wasted food."
unpopularopinion,fef9t49,t1_fef9eb3,1579051557.0,I see the wisdom in your argument. I would say this is more about food waste now.
unpopularopinion,fef9bug,t1_fef8g6c,1579051238.0,If it were to happen it would probably be taxpayer money if im seeing clear. We shouldn't just waste food. Maybe sell the ugly produce at a discount. Not sure but maybe they already do this at food markets

AlanWatts,fdpz1m7,t3_emjje3,1578646760.0,"He had a lecture that i recall where he mentions solipsism. He goes on to mention that there is no way to proove a solipsist wrong.
