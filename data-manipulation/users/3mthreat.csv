socialanxiety,feti880,t1_fet5b55,1579375688.0,"I will admit, I actually consider myself attractive, but it wasn’t always like that. I used to be a fat kid, but I’ve dropped about 100 pounds since 10th Grade (60 was due to actual dieting and hard work, 40 was due to a stomach virus). Even then, I still get insecure about my looks sometimes due to years of being picked on. But confidence really is key, If you believe you look good, people will pick up on it, even if you consider yourself unattractive by conventional standards. 

When I’m drunk, I tend not to care about anything at all. I actually have scared girls off before. It was raining outside beforehand, and I had a jheri-curl like hairstyle. It was dripping bad, and my dark outfit made it look even creepier. I went to talk to some girls, and they literally ran away. I actually laughed it off, but if I was sober, that would be a different case. I just wish I could feel like that 24/7, not just when liquor’s in my system.

You are right about the music. I live in a small town and I’ve been to every club here, so when I meet someone interesting, I tend to go to the areas where the music doesn’t sound as loud. Also, I try to talk during the slow jams, and not during the faster tracks. But I go to lounges if I want to form a more “real” connection with someone. For me, the clubs are for meeting more casual friends. The people I’ve met there will party with you, but won’t go out of their way to help you. But at lounges, I’ve formed better friendships because it’s a more intimate setting. 

If you do have to go out solo, lounges and bars are definitely better, more welcoming, and you will definitely meet quality people there, even if it takes a few tries."
socialanxiety,fet3nyl,t3_eqc9o8,1579371511.0,"I actually like going to clubs solo. No babysitting, I feel more comfortable dancing and talking to strangers, and I can leave on my own time. When I’m in a group I usually end up being the “responsible” one, because I tend not to drink or smoke as much, so it feels nice having more freedom and only being responsible for myself.

As for anxiety, if I’m going solo I usually drink a little wine about an hour before I leave. Makes it easier for me to start conversations and be more loose on the dance floor. Even then, I tend to be less anxious at night. There’s usually so many people I feel “invisible”, so I can easily brush off anything stupid or awkward that I do. But if it’s a smaller crowd I’m more nervous."
socialanxiety,felkwit,t3_epqjlx,1579224632.0,"“The Quiet One” has been my nickname since I was 12. I always try to play it off as being cool and relaxed, but my close friends and family know the truth."
socialanxiety,felkoje,t3_eprkt8,1579224480.0,"Yeah, I’m at a college where there’s so much going on, and everyone seems so extroverted and friendly, then there’s me. I keep thinking, “If you can’t survive college, then what’s the point?” I actually perform well at social events for the most part but the nerves beforehand can get too much for me to handle. Even when I do form connections, I put pressure on my self to act more outgoing than normal then I burn myself out and the connections start to slip.

What kept me going were those days rare days that I felt anxiety-free and drinking different teas. I am seeking professional help so those days become more common."
NoFap,felk32e,t3_epscw3,1579224072.0,"I know how you feel man. I been seeing this girl, and her schedule is kinda unpredictable. My advice is to just wait it out and find a hobby to pass the time."
socialanxiety,feki6fd,t3_epigcp,1579200555.0,"Yep. I did have an extroverted phase 2017-2018, where I was talking to at least 3 new people a day, but a lot of the people I met in that time turned their backs on me or got into drama, which made my anxiety come back worse."
NoFap,fek6tdc,t3_epfsk6,1579193811.0,"People laugh when I mention porn having negative effects but it can really can ruin your views on relationships. After I quit in July, I noticed just how much emphasis I placed on sex and how unhealthy it was."

hiphopheads,fdgoq24,t1_fdfvvpt,1578404225.0,"This is one of the strangest complaints about this sub.

If they listen to something popular, people say, “Oh, why y’all not paying attention to the underground, y’all hypebeasts, don’t care about real rap, etc...”

If they listen to something unpopular, it’s “Oh y’all so outta touch, y’all need to get with reality, etc...”

Which is it?"
NoFap,fc9urtg,t3_egpvc2,1577558522.0,"This is strange for me. I feel more connected, wittier, talkative, and “in the moment” on NoFap, but on PMO I’m more decisive, focused, calculated, and in control. Still would prefer the NoFap feeling though."
