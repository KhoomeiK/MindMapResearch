The best thing you can do at this point, aside from therapy (DO IT) is understand that it's not wasted. I don't know what to say, other than I know it wasn't wasted, my 7 years with my ex wasn't wasted, I know that now, but I also know that when I was in your shoes, it certainly felt that way. I'm sorry you have to go through this, but do your best to take care of yourself, grow from this, not for a future relationship, but for *yourself.*

Before I did any more dating after my divorce, I made 100% sure I was happy alone. I figured that people tend to shoot themselves in the foot when there's all this pressure about hanging on to someone.

I never said looks don't count, I'm not blind, I said they aren't weighted as heavily as people make it out to be. The very people who thing rule 1 and 2 are stopping them, tend to lack confidence. I've seen plenty of ugly dudes with no large sum of money who get women worth their weight in gold. Are they 10/10 ringers? No, but they have great personalities and they compliment their partners in great ways. I'm not interested in a 10/10 on tinder. I'm interested in someone who enriches my life."

dating_advice,fekmxr5,t1_fek3o6t,1579203391.0,"What bothers me is that so many people throw around the rules like it's rooted in your physical looks that you can't change, when that's only part of the equation. The bigger part is being an attractive *person.* Stuff like being genuinely kind, attentive, clean, confident and well dressed goes WAY further than simply having muscles, a full head of hair and a strong jawline.


Edit: Well, it appears the bitter ones have appeared. I've had very little success on tinder, that being said, never once did I say looks don't matter. I said it's not ALL that matters. And the kind of person to focus on rules 1 and 2 as a reason for their lack of success is likely looking in the wrong places. I've seen some butt ugly dudes with gorgeous women, and no, they didn't have a ton of money."

One day she came to me and told me she wasn't happy, didn't know what made her happy, but that she remembers feeling like she could be herself when I was overseas. Within a week she knew she wanted a divorce, in a month she was moving out, and about a year later, she was re-married. Honestly, to this day I have no idea if she realizes just how cold she was during the process, but I know I'm better off and I've come to see it as a positive change."

&#x200B;

I wouldn't say I feel shitty at this point. Many days I'm just living my life. I go to work, hang out with friends, road trip down to my mom's sometimes.

&#x200B;

On my down days, it's more just wishing I had someone with me. I don't miss her anymore. The speed at which she moved on from me, and kinda replaced me actually helped me re-evaluate just how good my relationship was with her. Spoiler alert - it wasn't great at all. 

&#x200B;

Here's what I did:

&#x200B;

1. The very first thing I did was take a long, hard look at myself and really evaluated what I did to contribute to the end of my marriage. Once I worked those things out, I came up with a game plan.
2. The next thing was counseling. I have a decent support group between my friends and family, and they were there for me in that first month or two, but I eventually began to pick up on the fact that they were starting to struggle with my constant gloominess. A counselors job is to listen to you about stuff like this.
3. Then I had to start working on forgiving myself. My ex gave me all kinds of reasons as to why she left, the things I did wrong, the fact that we didn't like the same food, or the same movies, how it always seemed like a chore to her to find something we had in common, etc. This made me feel like an utter piece of shit. After some time, I was able to realize a lot of her complaints about me weren't things I did wrong, it was who I was.
4. Acknowledge that the speed she moved on from you, or the apparent excitement she may have about being single again, is NOT a reflection on your value as a human being or a husband. It has nothing to do with you, no matter how much she may say it does.

&#x200B;

Also, I might recommend the book ""The Storms Can't Hurt the Sky"", by Gabriel Cohen. Yes, it say's ""Buddhist"" on the cover, no it isn't super religious or hoodoo-voodoo. It's actually really good at articulating what you might be going through. I'd highly recommend it."
