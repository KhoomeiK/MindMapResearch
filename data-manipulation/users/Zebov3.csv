Biden doesn't strike me as the one to ""excite"" the base. He might not need to (Trump may handle that), but I don't see Biden doing it. If Trump getting Democrats out to vote is true, that means the Democrats need to pick someone that will appeal to moderates, something a lot of the further left candidates won't do. Again, independents might vote against Trump so it won't matter who the Democrat is, but they might just stay home.

I mostly see these results as an indicator of people's belief that Trump will get enough people out to vote against him regardless of the opposing candidate - in that case Biden would probably be the best choice since he won't need to motivate the left and can get some independents.

This is coal chamber...never thought I'd hear another band like them. Got the techno/metal thing I love. Hints of the little bit of Ghost I just discovered. Singer sounds like Ozzy and coal chamber's lead singer.

Experienced techno/house/EDM/whatever-it-goes-by-nowadays about 20 years ago in Europe. Grew up on hair & alt metal. Love the fusion of both - Eisbrecher, Rammstein, Rob Zombie, etc. Pain sounds a lot like the Korn/Static-X/Coal Chamber era.

Thanks a lot."
coolguides,fd60a3x,t1_fd5yn3y,1578183752.0,"Yeah it's weird. I like the music, the vocals aren't that hard, but there's something about them I don't like. I probably just don't like the black metal growling style? At this point, I don't think I can describe it to myself even."

I got started with Manson (by far the best screaming I've ever heard still). Throw in some fear factory, static-x, and that's about as hard as I regularly go."
coolguides,fd5wfs0,t1_fd5hx4c,1578182359.0,I like that. But that's definitely not the norm for black metal.
coolguides,fd3frz1,t1_fd36zt1,1578157868.0,I'm used to growling/screaming as long as it's still somewhat musical. This just seems like random screaming. It's just not something my brain finds pleasing at all.

pics,fcung2r,t1_fctvkr8,1577984736.0,"Depends on what you mean by older. I lost my father when I was almost 8. I was still so young (and the event so traumatic), that I don't remember much of him. I've always felt like growing up without a father was like growing up without a tail. If you really don't remember it ever being there, you don't necessarily miss it. You miss the idea, but not the actual person. If any of that makes sense.

If you're talking about adult age loss, then yes, for sure it's harder to not have one at all. If for no other reason than being a single parent is stressful beyond belief so not only do you miss out on parental time with the deceased, but also with the now swamped remaining parent."

Then I thought how insane those pilots must be. Ignoring how low they stay throughout both the water drop and pickup, water is constantly changing - it can't be easy to maintain control."
coolguides,fd6abok,t1_fd60u8u,1578187935.0,"You might have just been successful being my sound cloud (or whatever people use now days). This is coal chamber...never thought I'd hear another band like them. Got the techno/metal thing I love. Hints of the little bit of Ghost I just discovered. Singer sounds like Ozzy and coal chamber's lead singer.

Experienced techno/house/EDM/whatever-it-goes-by-nowadays about 20 years ago in Europe. Grew up on hair & alt metal. Love the fusion of both - Eisbrecher, Rammstein, Rob Zombie, etc. Pain sounds a lot like the Korn/Static-X/Coal Chamber era.

Thanks a lot."

I got started with Manson (by far the best screaming I've ever heard still). Throw in some fear factory, static-x, and that's about as hard as I regularly go."

coolguides,fd3frz1,t1_fd36zt1,1578157868.0,I'm used to growling/screaming as long as it's still somewhat musical. This just seems like random screaming. It's just not something my brain finds pleasing at all.

pics,fcung2r,t1_fctvkr8,1577984736.0,"Depends on what you mean by older. I lost my father when I was almost 8. I was still so young (and the event so traumatic), that I don't remember much of him. I've always felt like growing up without a father was like growing up without a tail. If you really don't remember it ever being there, you don't necessarily miss it. You miss the idea, but not the actual person. If any of that makes sense.

If you're talking about adult age loss, then yes, for sure it's harder to not have one at all. If for no other reason than being a single parent is stressful beyond belief so not only do you miss out on parental time with the deceased, but also with the now swamped remaining parent."

The jist of my question is how can something be imperfect (Lucifer/Satan/fallen angel) in a perfect environment (heaven), which by definition, precludes that from happening? Whether it be Lucifer giving information to humans, or whatever Satan did in Luke 10. Both are someone/something being imperfect in heaven, which is perfect. How?

Hopefully we're not going in circles, because I really would like to understand. This is probably the worst possible medium, but it's the only one I have currently."
