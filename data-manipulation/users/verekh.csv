The rest seems cool, although kind of straightforward with no choices of any kind."

Gnarly mate!"
TerrainBuilding,ff8tina,t3_es71i4,1579695520.0,"It doesn't really have a rocky texture.

The texture it has is akin to coral as seen [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjF2bSGmJfnAhXB6qQKHcpIBcgQjRx6BAgBEAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCORAL-28799-IMITATION-POLYRESIN-AQUARIUM%2Fdp%2FB0763FFDDQ&psig=AOvVaw0jtKI9Qayl4a7BwYCIPpbe&ust=1579781811374912).

Try carving in some horizontal slits in a mostly crisscross pattern, and a different paintjob! Stipple on some grays and drybrush it with a tan."
TerrainBuilding,ff8q05c,t3_es9881,1579691155.0,I need some sense of scale.

todayilearned,fedo2cn,t3_eokbeu,1579016165.0,"Upvote for awareness.

Raid is goddamn gambling game, and not the end-of-all RPG's. 

Its commercials and marketing are great, but the game itself is stale and bland."

todayilearned,fd2tx7z,t1_fd2qns9,1578151616.0,"This is a good thing.

Working 40+ hours a week should not be the norm. We should strive for people having decent (normal) housing, and being able to have kids, take care of them well, and also pursue personal goals (hobbies / sports / education). 

The working ethic as a whole needs to change. We're IN the future right now, we can all achieve these things if we set our minds to it. Children should see their parents every single day and spent time with them. People need a break every once in a while and stressing over bills and being hit over the back for not working more than 30ish hours should evolve."
4chan,fd1se10,t3_ejp5ek,1578136061.0,Larp as a women - this is the best
