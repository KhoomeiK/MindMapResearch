nba,ffjkp0a,t1_ffjk9p3,1580000433.0,No... I can say with complete honesty I've never seen those before. But my memory isn't great and I shop for running shoes because I'm a runner.
nba,ffjj3d7,t1_ffjaacg,1579999365.0,I can confirm. I really don't like or pay attention to basketball at all but I know Jordan's shoes. Penny Hardaway or whoever that is? No clue. And I'm not a shoe guy either.

SelfAwarewolves,ffbb3cd,t1_ffb2a3h,1579758122.0,"I have no idea. She has an incredibly controlling mom, has to call every night to let her know how the day went, has to have this app letting the mom know her location at every point (life 360 I think it's called?), it's ridiculous and scary. If she doesn't call her mom freaks out. You'd think it might be because my girlfriend went to college a long way away? Nah it's only a 30 minute drive from the house.

Plus her mother calls her a slut, verbally abuses her, degrades her, etc.

I don't think her mother, and thus her family, would be accepting of her sexuality, given they don't seem to value her right now anyway... It fucking sucks. Fortunately my family (and I!) absolutely adore my girlfriend, so she's got somewhere to be."
Madden,ffaz0ux,t1_ff9lfqc,1579747781.0,"Yeah I hadn't played madden since '18, and it was super difficult adjusting to how long it takes QB's to throw in '20.

That, and breaking blocks as a d-linemen is much harder now? Seems like no matter who I have I cannot pressure the QB at all."
SelfAwarewolves,ffayigl,t1_ff9y0ia,1579747440.0,"I can confirm this 100%. My girlfriend is bisexual, in an extremely conservative family (the type with ""trespassers will be shot!"" stuff as a doormat). She's not out of the closet. Just last weekend before she traveled back to college she listened to her brother, whom she is very close with, rant about how all bisexuals and gays should be killed. But yeah, LGBTQ+ children are only a product of liberal families."
JoeRogan,ff8kbno,t1_ff8izhe,1579682568.0,"Unfortunately for the narrative being spun that article is just not accurate... Listen to Hillary being interviewed about it later, it's on YouTube. You'll find it's different from what's being spread as truth."
