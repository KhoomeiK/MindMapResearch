creepyPMs,ffp49dh,t1_ffoxxyw,1580085857.0,"In the US, there are two separate legal systems:  Federal law and state law.  Under federal law, sending porn or a few other things to minors is illegal.   There is no close-in-age exception.  The Federal standard for adulthood is 18.  The age of the sender isn't important (could be 15, 33, 44 or 99), if the recipient is under 18, it can be prosecuted by the federal government.

Individual states can have their own standards.  There is no federal ""age of consent"" standard at which its legal to have sex.  So different states can have different age-of-majorityd rules.  14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 are all common.  

So it can be legal for two people to have sex, but illegal for them to send nude selfies to each other.

(There is a federal age-of-consent rule, but it only applies to military bases, Native American reservations, National Parks (like Yosemite or Yellowstone), etc.  Those places use 18 as the age of consent because no state laws apply there.)"

bestoflegaladvice,ffozobo,t1_ffkha85,1580083686.0,"What i said, that started this particular slapfight, was: 

> Nudes -- even full body nudes -- are not necessarily sexually-explicit, and something that doesn't fit a general definition of pornography also can't fit the specific definition of ""child pornography"".

> While it's a line I would not want to test, there is at least a legal basis for nude selfies of minors not to be treated as child pornography.

Which is an accurate statement of law.  Assuming that an image is not sexually explicit (by whatever definition might apply), it cannot be child pornography. 

That is also an accurate statement of the law.  §3509 does not change this.  This is where current US jurisprudence stands, as far as I am aware.  A justice department circular is not a statement of law -- even though it purports to be one. Justice department *policy* is not statutory or jurisdicial. They may arrest and charge someone for possessing images that don't meet the definitions in 2252 and 3509, but I'd expect this to be aggressively challenged in court, with the final word coming from an appellate court or a court of last resort.

Regardless of all this, ""trading nudes is sexually-explicit conduct"" is completely irrelevant.  2252 makes it clear that it is the content of the image, not the use to which it is put, that determines whether the image is ""child pornography"".  3509 does not change that.

Some nudes of children are pornographic.  However, nudes of children are not pornographic *per se*.  I'm pretty sure I was clear about this, and that all my other comments should be read with this in mind.

The government might be able to criminalize the behavior of sharing nudes for prurient purposes, but that wouldn't make the material ""child pornography"".

The \*images\* must \*depict\* sexually explicit conduct.  To be pedantic, for your comment to make sense, they would have to be pictures depicting ""Minors sharing nudes for prurient purposes"".

You can read 18 USC §2252 yourself and get back to me on how your comment makes sense in light of the actual federal law.

It might be reasonable to say ""but there could be other laws that make it illegal if this one doesn't"", to which I'd give two responses:

1. In theory, yes.  But they wouldn't be ""child pornography"" because sec 2252 **defines** child pornography in a way that excludes images that do not themselves depict sexually explicit conduct.  A waist-up nude selfie or glamour shot is not inherently a depiction of sexually explicit conduct, so it is not child pornography.
2. Sending images, generally, is treated as form of protected expression.  The contours of that expression are defined in 2252.   Child porn is a carve-out from an entire body of protected expression.  So an image that is not sexually explicit is therefore protected expression *unless* it fits into one of the other categories of unprotected expression.  Notable among these is ""obscenity"" -- but that just gets us back to ""Ok it might be obscene, and thus not protected, but it's still not child pornography because it does not fit the definition in sec. 2252.""

However, there is dicta from at least one circuit court (which i don't have a cite for) that explains that an image can't be obscene for depicting children unless it would also be obscene for depicting adults.  That's not a black-letter statement of law, but it is food for thought.

I'm not advocating kids sending nude selfies, or especially not advocating adults collecting non-pornographic images of children.  But as it stands, *possession* of such materials is probably a protected activity.  Because Congress has plenary power to regulate commerce, federal statutes barring the production and trade of nude selfies of minors is legitimate and does not raise first amendment concerns.

But mere possession of non-explicit nudes of minors is probably (the way I read the jurisprudence on the subject) a protected behavior.

It's possible for insurance rates to rise even when a driver is deemed not to be at fault.  Every driver is sorted into a variety of categories (based on age, type of job, number of miles driven, driving history and any other way the insurance company can slice up the data they collect).

From all this,  the insurance company develops a ""profile"" of a driver's overall risk.  Having a non-fault accident can result in a driver being reclassified to a higher risk group.  Even if the person has exactly zero fault in the accident.  It's also possible to have an at-fault accident and *not* get reclassified to a higher risk group (and have rates not rise).

Usually, though, getting bumped up to a more expensive group is a pretty minor change that results in a small increase to premium rates.  If your relative's rates changed by a large amount, then (as others have suggested) he might actually be found by the insurance company to have some substantial fault.

The only real rule is that the rear party in a rear-ender (almost) always has *some* fault.  It is not a guarantee that the person in front has zero fault.  That is, fault can be shared between two or more drivers for any given accident.

It may also be that a slight change in the risk factors due to a non-fault accident caused the insurer to completely recalculate the relative's entire risk profile, and that other factors not previously known to the insurer are discovered and factored in.  That could be tickets or other things they had not yet discovered.

The way to know whether the increase in rates is ""fair"" vs an insurance company trying to grab more money is for your relative to quote out other carriers and compare rates.  If they \*also\* give him premiums thousands of dollars more than he was paying, it's likely for good reasons."

Because of the summary speed of the UD calendar, counterclaims can't be raised with a defense -- and because of that you don't lose your cause of action for unlawful eviction or illegal rent.  Normally, when a lawsuit is filed regarding a certain incident or set of incidents, all claims relevant to that incident have to be dealt with at once (that's a gross generalization).

IF this person was invited to or permitted to move in **by your girlfriend**, then your girlfriend is the landlord as far as the roommate is concerned.  The roommate is a sublettor, your girlfriend is the ""master tenant"".  If she's been living there for over a year, she's entitled to 60 days written notice, either hand-delivered to her or both of a) sent by certified mail and b) posted in a conspicuous place (like a bedroom door).  Keep the stub from the certified mail envelope.  Generally, r eturn receipt is not required but it's only a tiny bit more money.  If she refuses to accept delivery, that alone will be taken as proof of service.

If the person initially moved in by permission of the father, then HE is her landlord and would need to be the one to file and pursue the eviction.  Or he could probably hire a lawyer and (maybe) have you attend the hearing as a witness who can testify to the basic facts needed for an eviction to be ordered.  (testify about who owns the property, what the terms and conditions - if any -- were when the roommate moved in, and the fact that she was given proper notice to vacate.

In either case, an eviction case is something a person can manage without an attorney -- but you have to be diligent in educating yourself about the process and avoid mistakes that can cause the eviction to be thrown out and start over.  If you want a one-and-done solution, an attorney is a good idea.

And in California, the county and city in which the house is located matter a lot.  If you're in San Francisco or Alameda County, I'd recommend hiring an attorney and expecting the process to be expensive.  There are non-profit eviction defense law firms that follow a ""scorched-earth"" approach to defending against eviction even when there is no legitimate defense.

Another option is to take the money you'd spend on a lawyer and offer it to the person as an incentive to move out -- provided that the agreement is in writing, signed by both parties, and that she doesn't get the money until every bit of her personal property is removed from the house."

It would not be the landlord's action to evict, it would be the local code enforcement's action declaring your dwelling unit uninhabitable.

In California, the city matters a great deal.  Many cities have extra protections for tenants -- though  these protections normally don't apply in owner-occupied  situations, the fact that they live at multiple places clearly looks like an attempt to gain the owner-occupied exceptions.  A judge could set aside the exception if it's obvious that these landlords are gaming the system.

Anyway, it is illegal to collect rent for an illegal dwelling unit.  If you did not know at the time of the lease that it was illegal, you may be entitled to sue for the return of up to 1 year's back rent.

In addition, the eviction notice is clearly retaliatory in nature.  If you can substantiate the claim that the eviction notice was given to you after you complained about conditions, you may have a case to sue the landlord.  There are statutory penalties that can be sought in a court action.  This isn't a ""he-said/she-said"" situation, exactly.  If you document or substantiate the date of your complaint, and it precedes the threat of eviction, it is presumed to be retaliatory unless the landlord can substantiate a good reason for the notice to vacate.

If you've only called one lawyer, you might want to consider calling another one or two.  It's not possible to second-guess what the lawyer told you, because they probably have more information than we do, but there are questions that aren't answered in your post.   For example, you do not need to actually vacate the property to have a right to sue for illegal / constructive eviction, or to sue for illegal rent collection.

The downside of waiting for the UD is that if things do not go your way (for whatever reason) you would have a court record of the eviction that future landlords might find with a document search.  California is doing more than most states to keep eviction records sealed and inaccessible by document search services like Experian and Intelius, so my information on this might be out of date."

Assuming you are covered by your insurers, it would be their option to try to argue for an exception to the general rule that a supervening cause has to be more morally culpable than the more direct cause.

In many places in the US, bedbugs are not a ""habitability"" problem.  Bedbugs are not significant carriers of diseases that affect humans (generally because they don't live long enough).  Typically, a bedbug has one ""meal"", lays eggs and then dies.  They can survive for as long as six months without finding someone to feed off of.

Combating bedbugs doesn't need to be super expensive, as long as everyone follows the rules every time all the time without exception.  See /r/bedbugs for tips and strategies for fighting them.  I've known people who fought them off with discipline and diligence, without spending more than $100 in supplies (flypaper/bug traps, DTE, 95% denatured alcohol for spot-treatment and seams of clothing/bed linens/pillowcases)  -- if you can keep them from getting on your bed(s) for six months-ish, you win.

The other thing was that in the proceedings, Pruneyard's representatives made clear that they didn't object to the content of what the kids were saying -- which sealed their fate even harder because one of the major policy reasons behind the ""first amendment doesn't apply to private property"" rule is that the government can't force private entities to endorse speech they disagree with.

The point being:  With twitter, reddit,  youtube, etc. you generally cannot publish comments or content without an account.

A theft is ""perfected"" (that is, all the elements are in place and the criminal act is irrevocable) at the moment the item is removed from the rightful possession of another without their permission.  There is no ""return it and it's not a crime"", in purely technical terms.  Similarly, attempted extortion is perfected at the instant the threat is uttered:  ""if you don't pay me $500 I'll report you for theft"", for example.  Once the words leave your mouth, it's a criminal act (ignoring fatuous hypothetical ""but-what-if"" questions).

A theft or a battery against you creates a civil cause of action whereby you can seek to recover damages.  That is your only (not counting criminal restitution) remedy.  Thus, you can say ""If you pay my bills, I won't sue you"".  That's not a threat so much as it is an invitation to enter settlement negotiations.

For the criminal act, though, you have no legal interest in the outcome.  It's not up to you to decide ""if you do X then I won't report the perfected criminal act which has already taken place"".  A victim of a criminal act, as far as the criminal justice system is concerned, is a *witness* -- just a very specific kind of witness.  The parties to the criminal act are the State and the accused.  Thus, you can't condition the reporting or non-reporting of the crime, because you can't negotiate on behalf of the State.

So, in a purely technical sense, where the extortion statute is written like California's, saying ""I'll be nice and assume it was some kind of mistake, if you return it"" fits the elements of extortion.   You're attempting to gain a material benefit by the threat of criminal accusations.

Whether you report it or not, a prosecutor who learned of the battery could file charges on their own initiative.  The prosecutor would still have the sole discretion to decide that probable cause exists and a criminal charge is warranted.

""If you commit a crime, then I'll report it"" does not fit the elements of extortion, because you are not trying to gain money, property or a material or legal benefit of some kind -- other than to not be a victim of a crime, which is something you have the right to demand."

In the tort liability analysis (that person X failed in a duty not to cause harm), it requires (roughly) that the indirect party's actions are more ""morally culpable"" than the actions of the person who actually commits the crime.  That's why, for example, the mere negligence of an apartment complex not securing the bike rack area can't overcome the criminal theft of the person who steals a bike from the unsecured area.   Negligence is less than overt criminal actions, so the apartment manager isn't liable.

And that's true even with speech -- like a radio broadcaster being accused of indirectly inciting violence.  The individuals who act violently are acting criminally.  The broadcaster is (at first blush) merely negligent:  You should have known that your words could have this effect.

It is only when there is compelling evidence that the words were broadcast with *knowing intent* that violence *would* occur, that the moral culpability of the broadcaster comes equal to the culpability of the people who act out the violence.

Of course, I'm not saying that the speech was not made with that intent.  I'm sure the incendiary radio personalities are happy to have caused violence, and hoped that their words would cause it to happen.  The issue is that proving intent in civil cases is extremely difficult without some sort of direct evidence (like an email saying ""I hope someone hears this and kills a few people"") or some very compelling indirect evidence.

To prove ""did in fact know"" that violence would result is much more difficult to prove than ""should have known"" (roughly, the definitions of recklessness and negligence, respectively).   Generally, the link has to be compelling enough so as to negate the independent choice of the criminal actor.

If you signed the contract and then later talked her into disclosing information you were barred from disclosing, then you might be in breach of the contract.  If she didn't sign, she is free to do whatever she wants with the information she has.  If you didn't prompt her to disclose things and she does it on her own, then you probably aren't in breach."
legaladvice,fdwdu3h,t3_en42ld,1578757673.0,"Most often, what people refer to as an employment contract is more of an at-will arrangement where each party's duties are spelled out (you work, they pay you).  If the at-will nature of employment isn't changed by the contract, then at-will is still the default.  The difference is that a typical contract will specify how you can be fired or under what circumstances you can quit -- generally requiring good cause.  ""They never paid me"" is a good cause to quit.  ""They told me to stop coming in"" is another (generally speaking).  If they told you not to come in to work, then it may be that they are the ones who breached the contract -- in which case, they would not win any damages in court (though you might).

It's not clear whether you worked longer than the initial two weeks, but you are entitled to be paid for the work that you did do.  If you stopped going in to work because there was no work to do or because someone in an official capacity told you to stop coming in, then they would have a hard time showing that they were damaged in a legally-recognizable sense.

A lot of employers who do shifty things like you've suggested also get angry when things don't go their way.  Chances are, this is purely an idle threat.  They think ""you'll be hearing from our lawyer"" is going to frighten or intimidate you into doing something for them.

If you are sued, you should of course respond to the suit, ideally by having a lawyer represent you.   Until you're served with a court summons, though, don't worry about it.  In the mean time, make sure they have all company property, keys, passwords or other information necessary for someone to pick up where you left off."

Yeah, don't worry about that.  ""Pornography"" describes material that is sexually explicit or shows reproductive genitalia.   It's possible for a non-nude to still be sexually explicit, but if it's just a picture with all the ""bits"" covered, it's not porn.  And if it's not porn, it can't be child porn."
legaladvice,fduwm3b,t3_en4519,1578740085.0,"If you can't resolve this by speaking directly to your attorney, your State Bar association likely has a fee dispute resolution process.

Edit to add: You generally would pay costs (research, court filing fees, paper, copier toner, staff wages, etc.) **plus** the fee.  Is it possible that this accounts for the discrepancy?  It's possible that the attorney agreed to take costs out of the percentage fee, but usually you have to fight them to get them to agree to this, so you'd likely know already that cost is separate from fee."
legaladvice,fduwbaa,t1_fdueybb,1578739931.0,"When you say ""invested"", what do you mean?  ""Invested"" implies that there was an agreement by which you expected to receive more money than you put in, or maybe receive a share of the equity of the property, or partial ownership, etc.

If what you mean is that you spent money fixing up the place after the damage happened, with the expectation that he would reimburse you for the money you put in, then it sounds like grounds for a counter-claim against him.

If he's suing you in small claims, you may not need an attorney -- but you may want to consult with one to get set in the right direction how to proceed.

Or you can look up online how to file a counterclaim against a suit against you -- if it's small claims, there should be a fairly straightforward process to do so."

He'll involve his insurance company if he's not an idiot.  That might have you going out-of-pocket on the repair costs with the plan to get reimbursed by him or his insurer.   


But the reason insurance exists, generally, is so they can defend him if he gets sued."
