Rapekink,felaqq6,t3_d4zzcj,1579217793.0,"If you are worried about how you turn him on and how you touch him.

I suggest this, give yourself to him. You trust him? Pleasuring you will be all he needs. You won't need to roleplay, let it be intimate. You're feeling uncomfortable, he can give you that comfort.

But don't be worried if you still feel off, tell him.

That may be an unpopular bit of advice but, trust and true passion, let him show you you're okay in his arms, and he enjoys it, you'll enjoy it too hopefully"

depression,fel3k7r,t3_epoyc1,1579213301.0,"That's difficult to do, it took me about a year and a half of therapy to help. A key thing, find something that relaxes you, and just do it.

I like alone time, so relaxing to low music, soft scented and maybe video games. That I don't have to concentrate on much."
depression,fel340i,t3_epnbeo,1579213020.0,"I have younger friends, and nephews, and both have ended up with jobs before me, with help from my family. So I sit here while their life goes forward and I'm sitting still"

depression,feivp1c,t1_feii1ec,1579148492.0,"That sums up where I am in life now, I'm on here losing sleep over it, even eating at times (I get upset and trapped in my head, forget to leave my room, or just don't) I hate how I have to work so hard for nothing, while everyone around barely tries and thrives.

I mean I'm glad they are doing good, but what about me? Haven't I worked hard enough for something, anything? You know?"

Talk to people you see often in the comments section. You don't have to try and get in a relationship, just be friends. Go from there and it will help you branch out"

Rapekink,fbdssqh,t3_djxapo,1576770516.0,"It seems very very obvious to me, also unhealthy. 

You are kink shaming yourself. You like to be manhandled and taken advantage of, he will happily oblige, he gives after care. That's great news.

You aren't sick or dirty or anything, hell vanilla sex bores me. You want to ROLE PLAY a rape scene, do it. If that's what gets you off. Talk about bdsm with him. It seems to fit your needs."
ddlg,fbdqxj5,t3_ecq8m8,1576769292.0,"This is where communication comes in. Tell him you want to regress, what to expect ect.

The good thing about GOOD Doms, is control and patience. He may be a bit stricter with you, maybe. But you'll be fine. Doms have fun with their subs, and daddies have fun with their Littles. 

I speak from plenty of experience on this."

I need to practice what I preach more, but I do know it works. Especially the candles. Turn the lights off and have it lit up with just candles, it's so pretty and peaceful."
ddlg,fbdma3a,t3_ecsglg,1576766066.0,"I can't talk from a Littles perspective, or even a daddy's on this, but it has happened as a Dom before. I was being pressured and stressed, and just stopped.

Take a moment, it might be a small one like after working on assignments, and try to just relax mentally. You need to calm yourself down. I love candles  (wierd for a Dom, but it's good for sleep) lavender is relaxing. But try things like that first. Then slowly try to regress.

You'll be okay little one üôÇ always remember that okay?"

FOR BOTH OF YOU then don't. I understaffed wanting to make her happy, but self care is important too, mental health is extremely important. If it's too the point of that much problems, it doesn't seem SAFE to transition.

If you would like a bit of different advice on how to help on ""what to do then"" there are other dynamics you can get into that are similar enough. A lot even go hand in hand. But if you don't want any new things and want to go vanilla, say so until you are stable, and I believe she should support you"
