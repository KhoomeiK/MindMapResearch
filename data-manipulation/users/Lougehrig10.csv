The more specific or regionalized the population, the more specific the laws can be and still appropriately address the issues. Consensus on a national level is impossible only if consensus is 100% agreement, which is not the case in regards to the federal government.

Sure, it’s illegal federally, but many local governments have stated that it’s not worth their time, and it sure as heck isn’t worth the federal governments time. Sure, 91% of Americans might want marijuana to be legal, but if there isn’t a widespread problem, the 91% of Americans aren’t really going to be pushing for a change."
changemyview,fgcb474,t3_exng5j,1580670947.0,"I’ve been thinking about this for a while, and thought “Is it really a problem?” From my understanding, America’s government tries to establish a system to form societies that function in the environment they exist in. We have local governments which deal with the most specific laws. Stuff like “how do we provide water to each house” then we have state governments which deal with a little more generic stuff like “what are the education standards we want?” “How should our economy run?” Or “how should we interact with other states?” Finally, we have the federal government which has the big questions like “how do we interact with other nations” or “where do we place our funds” etc.

Because the needs of a local community are more specific and localized, it’s easier for everyone to agree on what needs to be done. However, the more generalized we become, the harder it becomes for everyone to agree because of the drastic difference in environments America encompasses. But this isn’t an issue, because the important thing is, the system seems to be fine enough that we can’t change it. If it wasn’t working well enough for majority of the population, it would change. Yes, there might be problems you have with the national government, but that’s why we have the smaller governments, they serve as a sieve to further refine the laws to better serve more local environments."
