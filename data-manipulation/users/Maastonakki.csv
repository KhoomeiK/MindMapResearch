I had no friends in school and from ages 5 to 17-18 I was always bullied in school and pre-school. I turned kind of sociopathic because of it and I disregard other people or in some manner behave very cautiously around them.

I am always super aware of my surroundings, I am on look out all the time. Also listening for any noise, sounds and people closing in etc. Itâ€™s really exhausting and really takes a toll on me mentally and I am exhausted and super irritated because of it. It is definitely not fun in any way.

Seeing how thereâ€™s still half a year of the current year left and itâ€™s past my birthday I can just say â€my birthday is next yearâ€

If youâ€™re born on dec 31th you can only say it on your birthday except for one exception. After all itâ€™s your birthday every year, you can still say â€next yearâ€ even though you havenâ€™t had your for the current year yet, doesnâ€™t mean you wonâ€™t have a bday next year"
