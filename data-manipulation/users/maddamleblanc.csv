When I was a woman (I'm transgender), I used to post nudes all the time.  I posted my face because I was young and dumb and ended up with stalkers.  It was not a good time."
AskReddit,ffu6zmp,t3_ev5zdg,1580235816.0,My husband surprised me at work with flowers and lunch.  He knew I was having a hard day and this made eveything better.
facepalm,ffiaf9b,t1_ffgu79i,1579969176.0,I never met anyone else who was allergic to bananas.  I have them so I avoid them.  I found out when I was on vacation and suddenly couldn't breathe because they were in a vegan cake I ate.

AskReddit,ff8n7by,t1_ff76cwc,1579686973.0,I did this and they still charged me.  I had to sue them and take them to court.  Their guns were disgusting and dirt.  I took pictures and reported them to the health department because they were basically stealing money from me.  Fuck LA fitness.
AskMen,ff5jl31,t3_erlbbu,1579595920.0,"Matched a Tinder date. She seemed cool.  I slow up she's ratchet af and smoking a joint behind the restaurant we were meeting at.  Fine. Whatever, it's just weed so it's not a huge deal. We sat down across from each other in a booth.   Turns out she thinks having a gun in her basketball short waistband is cool and is just not really caring about it not being secured.  I excused myself to go to the bathroom and left. No thanks."
trashy,ff5jc20,t1_ff4m4bo,1579595567.0,This. I don't know what I was expecting but it was dead pretty much.  It's like if I wanted to visit a Western city void of anything real I would have gone to the US.
AskReddit,ff5j4dq,t1_ff59rjt,1579595269.0,Meaning don't assume people in fastfood aren't making money when there are companies that pay plenty.
AskReddit,ff59q1j,t1_ff55czu,1579584502.0,I got paid 20/hour for being a fastfood cashier so...yeah.
AskReddit,ff58d78,t1_ff45qys,1579583252.0,Exactly. Back your team up.  Fuck Karen and her little tantrum.

videos,fezi1ws,t1_fez7x9p,1579457587.0,"Im guessing you're pretty young or don't live in the US before it was passed. Drug prices and health care premiums were not nearly as high as they are now.  For those who don't qualify, health care costs are ridiculous.  I used to pay a quarter of the amount I did years ago when I lived in the US,  before it was passed and I had much better coverage. Look up prices and how it affected.  Im on mobile and don't have time to write a novel on it. 

Reddit is full of people who really don't have a clue because they're too young or don't pay their own bills."

pics,fetfy9i,t3_eqg7h7,1579375096.0,This was my door this morning...it was only a few feet but it was super windy and all the snow drifted up against the door.  We dug out and it's fine now.   The joy's of living in Canada
AskReddit,fepa4oz,t3_eq1wzh,1579315564.0,"There isn't such a thing as 100% happy.   I'm actually pretty content with the life I built. I have 2 kids, a loving husband, and I'm living as the man I always wanted to be.  I get to travel and we aren't hurting for money. 

If you would have asked me this a few years ago then I would have told you a totally different story.  I was in a horrible marriage with a selfish woman.  I was also living as a woman and had so many body image issues.  It took a lot of work to get to where I am but I can say that I'm nearly 100% happy with how things are."

AskReddit,feflwsn,t1_fedfwcr,1579059139.0,My husband just told me this and I live in Alberta.   I have been on a trip to Maimi for the past 3 weeks and not looking forward to coming home.

genderqueer,fefij6d,t3_eovtgl,1579057043.0,"9 months isn't that long. I'm not sure why people think that's ""significant"".  If he's queerphobic and you're queer then it might be time to leave and find someone who isn't. As someone who is transgender, some times it's better just to cut people who are toxic out of your life.   

Sometimes people surprise you and aren't as trash as you think but there are still a lot of people who don't think anything outside of being cisgender should be a thing.

You should talk to him and explain exactly what non-binary means. If he's still queerphobic after that I would leave.   If you really are nonbinary then it's nothing you can really change even if you wanted to."
TheCuddlePuddle,fef7bki,t1_fedu66n,1579049887.0,I have had robos eat each other once they mature.  I wouldn't keep hamsters together at all. Rats mice and Guinea pigs are highly social and need buddies.  Hamsters do not.
AskReddit,fecgxw4,t3_eo83cx,1578973662.0,"Just an FYI, it's really disrespectful to say ""transgendered with the ""ed"" at the end.



Yes.  Due to safety concerns, it's mostly a thing to tell your partner.  Not everyone is okay with someone being transgender.  It can leave to violent and other issues if we are not open about it."
AskReddit,fe9hmyv,t3_eo3q9l,1578937635.0,None. Im on a nude beach currently

AskReddit,fdlxk75,t1_fdkcruc,1578534893.0,Same except as a grown man.  There's this arcade over where I used to live in Michigan that was awesome. I haven't came across any yet where I live now though.
tifu,fdiuqjt,t3_eldcu3,1578451477.0,"Noone gives a shit if you buy KY.  It can also have medical uses just an FYI.  I doubt anyone actually looked at you unless you brought attention to yourself by yelling out you're going to jerk it with KY tonight.  Seriously, none is going to give you weird looks or otherwise even care in store. This whole story is BS.  No manager is going to act like that even at a walmart unless you're making crude jokes and making it obvious you're jerking yourself off and being gross about it."
solotravel,fdgwer8,t1_fdgnvyl,1578409993.0,This.  I have no debt and get paid fairly well.
savedyouaclick,fdgw7l8,t1_fdfytlu,1578409854.0,Not true.  They microwave it.  It's disgusting too.
savedyouaclick,fdgw5ai,t1_fdgeove,1578409809.0,Clean the damn grill between food items like other places do.  It's a pain in the ass but at least it will make people shut up.

Okay then."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fdfvn2y,t1_fdeuto9,1578371423.0,Includes the flight from western canada so it's not really that expensive considering almost half the cost is a flight.
NatureIsFuckingLit,fdeustg,t1_fdej90j,1578347047.0,It includes air too. So really out of most places I've been it isn't that bad considering I fly from west Canada.
NatureIsFuckingLit,fdeumtu,t1_fdeja9c,1578346948.0,I fly from either Calgary or Edmonton depending on prices.
aww,fdem53v,t1_fdeglu4,1578341939.0,Not to mention all the zoological diseases monkeys can carry that can be transmitted to humans.
NatureIsFuckingLit,fdeiu9m,t1_fdedl39,1578339949.0,I also am including plane tickets into the cost too. Gas eats a lot of that up as well considering Iceland gas prices are pretty high.
NatureIsFuckingLit,fdeiodf,t1_fdeibbs,1578339851.0,"People assume I'm rich when I say I have been to some places and im just like ""nah, I'm just really cheap."" Don't get me wrong some things like gas are really expensive but it can for sure be done on a budget."

NatureIsFuckingLit,fded6sp,t1_fde5yhf,1578336454.0,Nope. Iceland just looks like that.  It's edited a bit but it really does look like something out of a fantasy movie/book.
NatureIsFuckingLit,fded0zs,t1_fde7x6o,1578336351.0,It's not as bad as you'd think. For a solo trip I normally spend 2.5k CND for a week.  I also cook everything and live out of a camper.
AskReddit,fdecsao,t3_ekt5n3,1578336200.0,I would be getting phone calls or texts after 15 minutes then probably be fired.  I would for sure be gone if I was 2 hours late.  The business I work in doesn't mess around and you have to be on time every time.
Unexpected,fdecmv0,t1_fdddd88,1578336106.0,Why defend someone who's not worth defending? He isn't on the same level of trash as Trump is.
