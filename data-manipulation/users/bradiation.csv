worldnews,fgyvbnw,t1_fgy9qj8,1581187459.0,"Sadly, it doesn't really surprise me. It has been fairly apparent for years that the Republican base has been gathering those individuals, who always seem to be a % of any population, that want a dictator.

What really baffles me and probably always will is that they chose TRUMP of all people to fill that role for them. Trump. The stupid, incoherent, vain, shallow, whiny, cheating, fake billionaire obsessed with TV. I mean....see themselves in him and all I guess, but they could have at least chosen someone that had some *thin veneer* of authority or command to anyone with more than 2 brain cells to rub together."

politics,fgxqopv,t1_fgxpl05,1581175737.0,"I don't really feel super comfortable commenting on that. It's very personal. But here goes *my own* thoughts: I don't like cities and crowds much so I ran away to the Rocky Mountains. If I could get back to VT I would in a heartbeat, but the downside of VT is that the economy is not super great and there aren't a ton of opportunities.

NH is a lot like VT, honestly, but with less patchouli and you can spot confederate flag stickers on trucks.

I loved the coast of Maine but I'd avoid inland Maine.

Boston is a fun city in my experience but I'm not a city person. Western MA has some nice towns but also a lot of dumps and a lot of too-rich suburbia places.

Since I've left I hear that meth is becoming a big problem in the poorer areas of all of these places.

But all that is just my personal opinion and experience."
politics,fgxo0wv,t1_fgv44me,1581174841.0,"So I haven't been in New England in a decade, but I did live all over for a bit there (VT, NH, MA, ME). Maine is perhaps more reflective of a lot of the country than the other two states I mentioned. Along the coast where the bigger cities (err, towns?) are, it's way more liberal. If you get more inland into the ""countryside"" of Maine it becomes more conservative and you can hear the banjos in the wind. Overall, the demographics are what you'd expect and the state leans Blue. You can see that in their congresspeople: an independent Senator, a Dem Rep, and Susan Collins, who has been supported by the inland folk and the richer coastal people.

Vermont is weird because it's overall very liberal, even in the more rural parts.

NH is weird because it has this weird libertarian streak everywhere, city or rural.

I guess the point I'm taking way too long to make is: in my experience and opinion, Maine is a fairly good microcosm/representation of the US as a whole. VT is uniquely liberal. NH is uniquely conservative/libertarian. So if you *had* to pick one that is out of place enough and most like AL, I'd say it's NH.

And just to wrap things up: CT is bleh, MA is kind of like ME but with a weird Irish Catholic history and a bit more racism, and who cares about RI?"

stopdrinking,fen5zgg,t1_fem8oc9,1579277723.0,"Oh shit, I *did* forget one thing, a thing which if it happens to you you may think ""That bradiation guy is a fucking *liar!*""

You *may* get a little more attention than your comfortable with on your first meeting. Depending on the group and meeting format it may start with ""Is anyone here new?"" which means you should say ""Hi I'm ____ and I'm new"" or whatever and they'll give you a coin and clap and shit. There's some attention that may be too much for people.

Again, depending on the group, they may then suggest they hold a ""first step meeting"" which basically is where everyone there talks about their first meeting, what brought them there, and how they felt and now feel about the ""First Step."" And they sort of talk *to* you. This will never happen again. But really, they're also talking to everyone there that may need to hear this stuff again that day. This is where people may *actually* look at you, like you mention you feared. *For a whole hour!* It's meant to show new people ""Hey dude/dudette, we're all like you, you found the right place. Welcome."" Because trust me, you *will* see parts of yourself in their stories. And after all *that* that first day, you slip into just being a member from then on. Quiet or chatty. Shy or outgoing.

So fair warning for that. To avoid all that, if it happens (again, depends on the group), you can just pipe up and say ""I'd like to just be part of a regular meeting today."" Problem solved."
stopdrinking,fem7j96,t1_fem0xxm,1579242570.0,"Hiya! I'm not here to push AA on anyone. AA is not for everyone. Get sober your own way. However, in my experience, way more often than not the way that works is the way with a support network of people with similar experiences. AA is that. And most of what you fear, which are shared by many (myself included for some of them at one point), is not true.

the people: ugh. bunch of drunks! awesome, supportive, helpful drunks

the dogma, the word “god” or “higher power”: This was a big turn off for me. But AA is really not religious, in my experience. The Book throws the word around a lot, but you can just replace any ""God"" with ""Zeus"" or ""the radiator in my 3rd grade classroom."" Sure, you'll find some bible thumpers, but you'll find just as many atheists, Buddhists, whatever. The whole ""higher power"" thing really comes down to keeping you, in your own mind, ""right-sized."" You are small. And so are your problems. And your insecurities, and your fears. It's a big world, go out and try to love it.

competitive nature: I have never experienced this in the slightest.

not fitting in: You will

not knowing what to expect: it's a very relaxed informal thing. Don't worry about it. After the initial formalities at the beginning of meetings, people just talk. Or don't. That's it.

people looking at me: Sure, they will. And then they'll look at someone else. You're not that important to them. Get right-sized.

having to talk: If you want, the most you would have to say it ""Hi, I'm _____. I'd like to pass today.""

not being “alcoholic enough”: The only requirement is a desire to stop drinking.

those weird coins: take 'em or leave 'em. Some people like a physical reminder. Something to hold when a craving hits. Some people don't bother.

shame, embarrassment, humiliation: You go to AA to get over those feelings.

Of course, that's all just my experience. YMMV. If you don't like one group you wander into, chances are there's another with a different group of people that you may like more.

Again, I'm not pushing anything, just trying to help clear up some of your reservations. Go if you want. If you don't, don't. But good luck!"

I do know that I don't agree with Pelosi on a lot of things, but I think she is damn smart and very savvy. There aren't always guarantees in DC but I don't think she ever makes a move unless there are the best possible odds in her favor. That doesn't mean it will always work, but I'm sure a lot of careful thought goes into it.
