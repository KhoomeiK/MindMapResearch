dontyouknowwhoiam,fffimn3,t1_fffihjw,1579884768.0,Well when I posted that it had 0 not it's at +100 is that not strange? And what exactly is wrong with someone bringing more context to a post?

justneckbeardthings,fff7dow,t1_fff70zj,1579877577.0,Oh I'm right there with you on all of that. Canadian political junky the suit thing just through me for such a loop it made no sense. Especially when theres photos of tons of republican presidents in tan suits. (Side note tan suits arent formal? I might not know anything about suits.) I wish this double sided bullshit would end. It's like employment rates. The aide not in power says they are worse than it looks while the side in power says everything is fine and once they switch they just swap messages. Borth america needs laws that compel politicians to tell the truth.
justneckbeardthings,fff6xi8,t1_fff6tw4,1579877262.0,Ahhhh okay. I was so confused thinking there was some negative connection to tan suits. Just more dumb hypocritical outrage.

facepalm,fdhkt93,t1_fdhkfj5,1578424763.0,So what are you for them or against them? The fact we killed their predators doesnt change the fact its necessary to not do more harm. You're on reddit making blanket statements about animal welfare. If you dont want assumptions made about you you're in the wrong place by far.
TumblrInAction,fdhkmsq,t1_fdhk8cb,1578424653.0,Best way to share the screenshot from before? I thought it would post both. I dont understand posting photos without imgur lol. Essentially a poster brought up that the victims were male and op brought up the perpetrator was male. I said it derailed. I'm of the personal opinion that even if the perpetrator is male we have heard men are the problem so long the people we need to get through to arent hearing it. When it comes to male victims we need to do alot more to help us come forward so we can have a realistic picture of all this horrible shit.
facepalm,fdhjykj,t1_fdhi7u7,1578424247.0,"Nah we gotta drastically change how we farm and work with animals. Gotta make sure the way we get our food isnt so destructive its unsustainable. But if we just go on how uneducated people feel about animals we will end up doing more harm than good and frankly theres an entire host of wild animals no one is even talking about here which again. Monocropping kills wild animals and destroys. You're focused on one aspect while ignoring everything else that comes into play. I've dealt with too many of you damn animal right fucks argue against things like deer culls which if weren't done would directly lead to the destruction of an ecosystem and the suffering of wild animals. Too many of you fucks argue against using animals within alternative farming methods to get intensive vegetable crop yields which will be necessary to do away with factory farming and feed humanity without destroying more natural habitats. Our use of animals especially for food and clothing has been monstrous but that doesnt mean we cant live with and benefit from relationships with these animals in the future. In fact if we are going to repair the areas we have clear cut to grow crops to feed livestock it will get done the fastest with alternative farming methods like permaculture and food forest, using animals for pest control, fertilizing, clearing, and yes to get a yield, and then transitioning those areas back into wild areas by being more open minded by what we think of as edible foods and allowing the wild things within existing areas to flourish in those places of restorative agriculture. We need bigger ideas than you're putting forward if we are going to survive as a species and more importantly if we should even deserve to. If you're going to get in the way of those bigger ideas you're not helping."
facepalm,fdhin0i,t1_fdhiape,1578423440.0,I didnt word that well n now that iv hit a big bowl honestly I'm not sure what I was saying or if it even was meant here or if I was mixing up responses.

facepalm,fdhhqt7,t1_fdhhkg3,1578422900.0,Lmao. Rotating crops is a bare minimum to make monocroping work without going broke on buying fertilizers. It's still degraded our soils horribly. Fucking joker.

facepalm,fdhhdx0,t1_fdhgxg9,1578422685.0,"Seriously. You dont know the various ways animals can be raised in low impact ways theres no point in talking to you. Animals can be used to sink carbon even if implemented correctly within holistic alternative farming methods. Alternative agriculture is a thing buddy and we need to start using it now to fix the damage we've done. Crop stacking, animals for pest control and fertilizer is the way forward, not some dumb idea we can synthetic our way out of this, fuck you're missing half the picture."

europe,fdhgomv,t1_fdhelad,1578422261.0,Eh I know alot of old conservative white people who absolutely would be terrorists if they didnt spend all their time bitching and moaning  frankly we are lucky so many of us north americans are too damn lazy to do anything about what they complain about. Hell I know a bunch of SJW who would be terrorists as well if they left their internet. People calling for horrible things but are too lazy to do anything themselves.

facepalm,fdh9k7w,t1_fdgqv6r,1578418322.0,I believe it's both. We've bred them for more and more milk and we keep them constantly knocked up.

Not only that but the zero care given to monocropping and the rest will negate half this shit anyways. If we dont change the profit motives of farming then even if everyone's vegan itl be soybean fields and other konocrops that are the issue. We have destroyed our soil and the only way to remedy that is with intensive animal husbandry(that word bothers me, makes me think of people fucking their livestock) frankly we need animals to fix a large amount of the damage we have done. Can you honestly tell me that if we remove the profit motive of capitalist society that the way we care for and use animals would still be cruel. Can you really not see a world where we use animals in beneficial ways, like chickens for pest control and goats for clearing land. Sure we could do away with that entirely and then what use machinery? Frankly I'd rather work hand in hand holistically with what mother nature gave us."
facepalm,fdh5zu4,t1_fdh5jfe,1578416115.0,Holy shit the shity info. Vegan diets have not been around since the beginning of time and any anthropologist can tell you that. You have no clue what you're talking about and are pushing bad science. And when you use blanket statements and animal agriculture and fishing being the leading cause of those issues it's just so moronic. Everything humans do has an impact. From how animals are fed to hydroelectric and solar wr need to reduce our impact and the best way to do that and reverse the damage we have done to the soil is through responsible intensive animal husbandry and when it come to fishing similar idea we have done a huge amount of damage that we need to fix selective methods of fishing and going after species that we have caused to become problems will be part of that. None of this is nearly as simple as you folks seem to make it out to be and the all or nothing bullshit will never work
facepalm,fdh5lnh,t1_fdh3dm8,1578415875.0,No psychology today is not a valid source for that type of medical knowledge. Also no no educated vegan will argue for anything but a meat containing diet for dogs.
facepalm,fdh58h3,t1_fdh4nj9,1578415653.0,You're probably right. But the reality is spot treating the symptoms isnt going to solve anything. It comes down to capitalist bullshit that's been spread around the world and an obsession with fast fashion and cheap products. Less wool sheep is no problem if society goes back to a quality based model and repairing/ making things last instead of trashing them and buying new ones. And frankly part of the issue is what we are doing now. Instead of the internet making us all smarter and more connected it's made everyone with access think their opinion is valid and ended up with constant bickering.
facepalm,fdh4xp1,t1_fdh2wwk,1578415466.0,Why is it people argue for synthetic bullshit that's production is largely harmful to the environment just so they can feel better. How about this. Most people dont have the education or resources to feed their pets vegan diets and the newness of such things would in fact make it irresponsible to do so without further study. There is a reason people are being charged with animal abuse and child endangerment these days. Cause people who put ideology over truth are promoting bullshit like this. A diet that still needs regular blood level checks while the richest country in the world still charges for healthcare is in no way a doable solution ffs.
facepalm,fdh4k61,t1_fdgyhot,1578415235.0,People project onto lobsters ffs. Giant water bugs who lack the parts of the brain to process pain and then they think they are screaming in boiling water. Feels outweighs fact and most people never knew the facts.

Showerthoughts,fdgy2i2,t1_fdgiluk,1578411141.0,"When I was in highschool my cities public libraries all started having a health drop in center with little safe sex kits for kids. There were condoms everywhere at school after that. Not used just stuck on things. It was pretty hilarious. But as a service was awesome, just walk into the library walk into the room between the bathrooms walk out with a pocket full of condoms and no questions."

TumblrInAction,fdgxjfy,t1_fdgwrw5,1578410776.0,Also is there a reddit appropriate sub you could point me to. I'm blanking.
TumblrInAction,fdgxeus,t1_fdgx9im,1578410688.0,"Completely missed the jo reddit content. That is totally my bad. But for rule two this isnt identifying info and frankly I think many subs use that term to strictly, doxing is not the same as exposing and anonymous username."
TumblrInAction,fdgx9im,t1_fdgwrw5,1578410585.0,"Huh? Are you talking this sub or that one and again I dknt see how this break the rules on their sub, if it does then it's all based on feels? Well that's a dumb world? And if you mean not blanking usernames well frankly I dont care why exactly are we expected to censor anonymous usernames, ita not like its fb"
unpopularopinion,fdgw40l,t1_fdgvtnb,1578409785.0,"There have been white slaces throughout history bud.slave comes from slav, asshole. I have every clue why  people are selfish ass holes. Pretty much explains every bullshit thing that's happened through history
 Now my entire education is politically focused on progressive politics and advancing those ideals in Canada, I work for progressive parties and Non profits, and you feels based asshole who push division more than unity are making our lives impossible to keep fighting for change."
TumblrInAction,fdgvwg0,t1_fdgvsmy,1578409638.0,Honestly I sont know how to survive this world anymore with this shit. I'm a progressive person but at this point it feels like if someone cares enough to believe in something they are going to be biased and wrong and no one can talk about anything.
unpopularopinion,fdgvkb5,t1_fdgvgny,1578409399.0,It is entirely. Then again almost everything anyone posts on reddit is incorrect in someway and is often missing heaps of nuance but that doesnt change the fact your wrong.
unpopularopinion,fdgvgsd,t1_fdgv2qg,1578409329.0,"You mean strawman? And I never said I was irish, I said it's part of my background, irish, italian, Austrian, welsh(think I forgot that last post) and canadian first peoples. It absolutely is one of the countries with the most biased and divisive histories, brexit cant even happen without risk of violence. Hows this. One of the most biased and divisive histories for modern western nations, better?
Edit brexiteers to brexit. Stupid auto correct is brexiteers even a thing? And no I am no pro Brexit. I'm pro replace the european union with a fair trade european union."
