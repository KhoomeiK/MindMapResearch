The users seem to enjoy it, and the mods gave me a one time pass. Everyone's having a good time. What's the problem? I sincerely apologize you're taking this so personally. 



This conversation is not very productive so I'm going to go ahead and end it now. 

You have a great rest of your night! cheers!"
masterhacker,ffe0htz,t1_ffctz9k,1579833531.0,"I really couldn't read most of what you wrote, but I think I got the gist of it. To clarify,  a shitpost is something posted without any effort. What you're describing is more circle jerking. I know you are a new user and some of the terminology is confusing. When you get a minute go read the reddiquette, I brush up every couple years myself. It's just good business."

>This school's dedication for teaching has brought to memory a similar story from Japan where a train has been running to pick up and drop only one passenger—a schoolgirl. Media reports claim that the railway company initially had planned to shut down this railway station due to a declining number of passengers. However, after the authorities were informed that a schoolgirl had been using the train every day to go to school, the authorities decided to continue the train until the girl graduates from high school."
