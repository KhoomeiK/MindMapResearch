The fact of the matter is that due to his cap hit he’d be an easy addition for a cup contender in need of help on the wing."

Currently? Marchand was the one who came to mind. Marchand is a rare talent, one of the most complete players in the NHL, but he’s just such a shitheel. He is a player that we should all consider ourselves lucky to watch, but I just can’t enjoy him because of the dirty plays."

If you’re making a few million dollars a year and have the backing of a sports team worth hundreds of millions you can get a world class specialist in the blink of an eye.

EDIT: I’d also guess there’s an element of complexity (or lack thereof) involved as well. If you’re doing a surgery on someone who is elderly or sick there are a bunch of potential complications and risks. With an athlete you’re dealing with a young person in peak physical condition."
DetroitRedWings,ffcun0l,t1_ffcoz2c,1579807600.0,"I could see him doing that TBH. Zadina has started to find a rhythm, and having a long break could disrupt that, better to keep the guy playing. Additionally I feel like the more reps he gets against pro competition the better."
DetroitRedWings,ff9ct75,t3_ese6iz,1579710122.0,"I doubt it. Tag hasn't really looked that impressive from what I've seen. He's doing decent this year, 34 points in 40 games, but last season put up only 9 points in 30 games, and 11 in 41 the year before that. I just don't think he has the makings of an NHL player.

EDIT: To be fair Tyler Bertuzzi looked like a massive reach when we drafted him in 2013 (22 points in 43 games in 2012-13), so who the hell knows."

hockey,fehjjng,t3_ep4kh4,1579117839.0,"This makes sense, and probably also has something to do with the fact that goalies on the whole have gotten better. 

In the 1990's the highest save percentage across the decade was Dominik Hasek with a .926, league average was a .898. So the best goalie in the league was saving .028 better than league average, that's one goal per 35.7 shots, close to a goal a game (assuming roughly 30 shots per game). Assuming a starter plays 60 games a season that's massive. In 2018-19 60 goals was the difference between 1st place in goals against and 20th. In 2017-18 its the difference between 1st place and *27th*. Hasek was the difference between elite defensive numbers and the bottom of the barrel.

Second place Patrick Roy (.912) was .014 better than league average throughout the 1990's. That's one goal every 71.4 shots, slightly under half a goal a game. That's still pretty big. In 2018-19 30 goals is the difference between 1st place and 10th, in 2017-18 it's the difference between 1st and 13th. It's the difference between elite and good.

Last decade the leader was Tukka Rask with a .921. The league average was a .913, so Rask was .008 above league average, that's one goal every 125 shots, or roughly one goal every four games. Across 60 games that's 15 goals. That's not trivial, but it certainly isn't anything close to Hasek or Roy.

The fact is that there isn't enough distance between elite goalies and average ones to make them worth it anymore."

todayilearned,fedxst9,t1_fedsmvw,1579022151.0,It may have been part of it. Obviously this was quite some time ago (and pre Federal Rules of Evidence) but federal attorneys don’t really take risks. The US Attorney’s Office doesn’t usually make a move until they have all their ducks in a row. That would include knowing they have enough clearly admissible evidence for a conviction.

DetroitRedWings,fe9n2yb,t1_fe9jlin,1578939613.0,"Given how quickly he adjusted to the USHL and NCAA I was hoping we could maybe see him as early as next year, but that's looking pretty unrealistic now. However because of his adaptability and talent I wouldn't be shocked if he was up with us in his age 23 season. I also wouldn't be shocked if it was 24-25."
hockey,fe9mr8i,t3_eo7mpz,1578939492.0,"My general guideline is that if a forward is a PPG through 1,000+ games they should be in. Essentially I'd need a reason to exclude a forward with 1,000 points in 1,000 games. Obviously there are forwards who did not reach that mark (Pavel Datsyuk for example) that I still think are worthy of induction. 

With defensemen and goalies it's much harder to set a statistical or awards milestone. One thing I would look to, though I don't have a clear ""rule"" like I do for forwards, is being a finalist for an award (as opposed to just looking at wins). If a guy is a perennial finalist for the Norris or Vezina that means he was a consistently amongst the best in the NHL, even if he rarely (or even never) won.

Additionally, for all positions, I'd look to the Hart Trophy. There are only three eligible players (Tommy Anderson, Al Rollins, Jose Theodore) who won the Hart and are not in the Hall of Fame. So if a player has won the Hart then I'd need a reason to exclude them."
DetroitRedWings,fe9eit7,t1_fe8cw6l,1578936884.0,"Larsson is still on a good track. He’s struggled but he’s also 21. IMHO the timeline for a goalie is to have him become an NHL goalie by 24, so he’s got a few years before there’s concern about if he can become an NHL goalie."

DetroitRedWings,fdopnm7,t1_fdo2d3k,1578610061.0,"One of the three goalies the Rangers have will be moved, and it won't be Lundqvist. Shestyorkin is viewed as the savior, and is incredibly talented, but he's a year older than Georgiev and has less NHL experience."
hockey,fdnyxjf,t1_fdm51nd,1578595677.0,"In the 1990's Hasek had the highest SV%, the gap between him and number 2 (Roy) was the same as the difference between Roy and league average.

DetroitRedWings,fdny044,t1_fdnhyiv,1578595142.0,"It's possible that Georgiev or Shestyorkin is available, as the Rangers aren't looking like they'll dump Lundqvist, and I doubt they'll carry all three (it's just not feasible in the long term). Either one would be a good addition.

Even though his goal numbers haven't been great this season I could see moving AA, possibly with a mid round pick or a mid-level prospect, for one of them at the draft."
hockey,fdkpgfv,t3_eltlw5,1578508421.0,"Hockey *should* be in the summer Olympics TBH. Basketball is a winter sport, but it's a summer Olympic sport to make the scheduling work. Same with soccer/football, season is in the fall/winter/spring but the world cup and olympics is in the summer."

hockey,fdedtzr,t3_ekxcbj,1578336854.0,"The NFL and NHL will never be talent driven in the way the NBA is. The NBA is talent driven because starters play like 75% of the minutes. Wilt Chamberlain is an old example, but he averaged almost 46 minutes a game (out of 48) throughout his career. Allen Iverson averaged 41 MPG, and LeBron averages over 38. It would be insane for a player in the NHL to average over 30, last season the highest average TOI was 26:42.

Because of this (and the nature of basketball as a sport) stars have a massive impact they can't have in the NHL. NBA stars can average 30+ points per game, almost a third of the teams points. The highest GPG in NHL history was 1.15 (Gretzky, 1981-82) that year his team averaged 5.21 goals per game, which was 22.1% of his teams goals."
