3 sets of the following

30 star jumps
10 push ups
20 squats
10 rows with the 5kg
20 lunges
30 sec plank


Star jumps are when you start standing then jump your feet out and circle your arms out + up then jump and return to a standing position

Push ups keep you elbows in by your side is good form

Rows are done with putting two chairs together so you can put your left knee and left hand on them and then hang the weight down on your right hand and lift it to your chest."

You will never know what feeds your soul by looking for it. You uncover it by working upon your character by becoming the best version of yourself. By discovering your unique gifts that you have to give to the world.

Good luck my friend.

Oh and don't worry about giving up the weed, when you are following your life's purpose it will be left behind with the rest of your crumbling facade."

You are a different person now who will continue to evolve just set your goals high and look towards them  day to day. Yes the environment you are in will have an impact so lead by example and change your circumstances."

selfimprovement,fevnt18,t1_feubc6r,1579399487.0,One must partake in self care that allows it to overflow. When this happens it is not poured out as it is constantly full and emptying itself into the world.
selfimprovement,fevckz8,t3_eqp8be,1579395797.0,It does depend what you need at this moment in your life. Most of the time one statement will resonate with who you are in the entirety of a book. However don't discount the rest of it life is a journey and reading the rest of the book prepared you for that Eureka moment of clarity. Go to a library and get the ones that resonate with you.
