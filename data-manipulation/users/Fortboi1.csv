depression,fczv02j,t1_fcyvdg8,1578109074.0,"Ahh, definitely a valid concern. I'm certainly not an expert on this topic but i've read numerous books from having the same issue. From my experience I would say that it's important to constantly understand why you do what you do and how that action serves your life. Eating bad for example I would go like ""I am eating this because it tastes good, this is going to make me feel tired, sluggish, unhappy, ect."" For working out you could say to yourself ""I could be working out, but instead I choose to do (X) right now. It doesn't take that much time, just give yourself maybe a minute each negative option you choose and genuinely evaluate if it's what you want, because in the end it really is all about what YOU want. Do YOU want what you want enough to make a sacrifice or compensate.

If you're not satisfied i'd highly recommend the book ""Atomic Habits by James Clear"", it's the only book you'll ever need about developing and removing habits."

depression,fb2j95f,t3_eb0ggo,1576452063.0,I feel you bro. I wanna share some of my wisdom with you. What saved me was strong positive habits. It's very hard to feel like life is a burden when you remind yourself time and time again how much you care about yourself through your actions. I hope only the best for you man.
