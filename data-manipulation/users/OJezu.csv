The most deadly diseases are the ones we got from living to close to too much livestock. There was a lot of exposure and only few instants of disease jumping between species. Also: why cold won't kill aliens."

Or just ask the barista for a coffee that is not bitter, but that has to be in a fancy place that serves single-orgin from Chemex, Aeropress and such. Don't be intimidated by all the fancy hipster stuff, but it's the only kind of places when you can easily get that kind of coffee. The taste profile may also be simpler, as in clearer. 

I guess most mass produced coffee is bitter, as this is easier for most consumers to swallow than sour taste. Also if you source for coffee from wherever, it's easier to keep consistent taste of our is all burned to hell."
