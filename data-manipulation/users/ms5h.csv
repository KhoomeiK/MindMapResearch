1 package firm tofu, cut in 8 even slices

Place slices, cut sides down, between paper towels while making the glaze. Press down to remove water

Stir together 2T soy sauce, 2T brown sugar, 1t sesame oil, 1t minced garlic, 1t minced ginger 

Place tofu on oiled baking sheet and brush with half the glaze.

Bake 30 minutes at 350F. Flip, glaze other side, and bake 30 minutes longer. Sprinkle with sesame seeds if desired after glazing the second side. 

Cool on a rack after baking. 

I cut the slices into thin strips and added to my stir fry near the end. 

I made this stir fry with rice noodles."

Professors,fd4rfu0,t1_fd4qmll,1578170371.0,"Really? That’s unusual, to me at least. Nevertheless, using the trick of repeating the student eval language helps immensely. When they see the questions they are reminded if your intent, rather than your actions."
Professors,fd4g3ek,t1_fd48c84,1578167179.0,"How do they know what “on time” is supposed to be? Layout a generous return time in your syllabus, and then get them back early if you can. If you can’t you’re still “on time”.  Also, if you’re not already, use the language of evals in your course. Say “it’s important to me that I get papers back on time/promptly”, so if I can’t I’ll let you know”. That way they’re primed to think of you as someone who does get things back on time."

Not sure why you’re being defensive- it wasn’t a criticism, but pulling the idea a bit further."
