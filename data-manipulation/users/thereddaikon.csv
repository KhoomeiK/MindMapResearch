Where the guns are already illegal and the people doing the transactions aren't allowed to own them anyways. If they were buying their guns legally they wouldn't be criminals would they? Banning them wholesale does nothing because the supply still exists. All that does is deprive lawful citizens of owning guns. To get the guns out of the hands of criminals would require you to forcefully take all guns. It goes without saying that that is impractical for many reasons.

Guitar,ffcjkmj,t1_ffbmt9n,1579800831.0,"There are a few ways you can ""harmonize"" guitars. I put it in quotes because most methods are not actually in harmony. The easiest way to do it is to have two guitars playing the same thing but with different tone. Pan them away a bit and you get a nice wide and full sound. That is the simplest form and called doubling. In modern studio recordings it's common practice to get a full sound. You can go further too. Triple, quadruple etc etc your tracks. The sky is the limit and the only real rule is what sounds good.

The second way is what you touched on, using octaves. It's pretty self explanatory. You can either record two parts played in different octaves or use effects on a single track to achieve this.

The third is true harmony and requires music theory. Don't just set an Octave pedal to fifths. Intervals are relative to the root and can mean different things in different keys. So a quick and dirty approach like that may not work. You will need an understanding of scales and how chords are built to make sure it sounds good. I would start by learning how functional harmony works and then study the solos of bands that are known for good guitar harmonies for inspiration. You can get really deep into theory here and make some very cool sounds.

You can also mix and match techniques. Boston, the band that made harmonized guitars famous combined these ideas all the time. The two guitars would often play the same phrase or in octaves but end it on different notes that formed a chord together. They were also innovative in recording and mixing techniques. Tom Scholz basically invented that big epic sound."

Guitar,ffadd4r,t1_ffac5q8,1579732894.0,"I guess I misinterpreted your statement about playing to a click. I thought you meant practicing to a click.

In that case I agree. The point of a metronome is to build your internal sense of rhythm, not to be a crutch for playing live. I've never played live to a click. The drummer is my click, or back when I was in school the conductor/drum major.

And there is absolutely nothing wrong with changing up the tempo subtly for feel and effect. In fact I think it's an important technique that's too often ignored in modern music. Someone else mentioned a Beato video where he showed John Bonham was rushing. Bonham was a great drummer and I have no doubt he could keep a near perfect tempo if he wanted too. Zep was known for their grooves and rushing was a conscious decision. It's a great example of feel as you put it.


But I don't want people to take your post the wrong way. It's a common thing in music circles for the inexperienced to say that they don't need to learn or practice a certain skill because so and so didn't without actually understanding what's happening.

You can't groove like Zep if you don't already have good timing. If you can't keep time with a static metronome then you can't keep up with a shifting groove. This applies to everyone, not just guitarists. And especially drummers because when playing live at least they are setting the groove and everyone plays off them."

If you have bad timing you won't be able to effectively modulate tempo in a way that makes the music better.

It's another example of knowing the rules so you know when to break them. Nobody ever said that a song has to have one fixed tempo throughout. But having bad timing doesn't mean you will be changing with the feel. It means you won't be in time with the drummer and you will sound like shit."

WarCollege,feonqrw,t1_fenhhdc,1579302638.0,"I would consult ~~/u/Duncan-M for an indepth explanation on modern infantry tactics. He knows his stuff.~~

But to give a quick and dirty answer, it was a force multiplier. The Germans had been developing their small unit tactics since the first world war, Rommel's memoirs are a decent starting place if you want to know how that developed. By the start of the second world war the Germans based their force structure around the machine gun. First the MG34 and later the MG42 would be the primary weapon and the focal point around which everything else would happen. The MG squad would provide what the modern US Army calls a base of fire which would suppress the opposing side and allow riflemen to out maneuver them.  

This was a very effective tactic and in many ways forms the basis for modern infantry tactics. There are some limitations though. You are relying on a single MG and the riflemen don't have anywhere near the volume of fire. You also have infantry equipped with sub machine guns, MP40's etc, but those are close range weapons and are unable to dominate an area like a proper machine gun. 

This wasn't lost on the Germans. There were attempts fairly early to try and increase the firepower of the individual rifleman. This resulted in various weapons such as the Gewehr 41 and 43 semi automatic rifles meant for standard infantry and the FG 42 automatic rifle for paratroopers. These weapons weren't without problems though. They were large, heavy, expensive and fire full powered rifle cartridges. So while they did increase individual firepower they weren't particularly handy or cost effective weapons. Automatic rifles in general are also notorious for being difficult to use. Their high recoil makes their practical accuracy low in full auto fire. My mind goes back to a quip about the M-14 becoming an anti aircraft gun when fired FA....

So there's the challenge. How do you give an individual rifleman the firepower of an MG, but also give them a weapon as handy as a short rifle? You can't just equip everyone with MG 42s, not only is that too expensive. But its a crew served weapon. You can't give everyone SMGs. That will work in urban combat but if and when things move out to the country side you are faced with a serious range and accuracy disadvantage. You want something full auto and powerful enough to be effective at normal combat ranges but to also be cheap and not a burden.

Sturmgewehr was the answer. By firing an intermediate cartridge you solved both the range and recoil problems. Most front line rifles of the era were over powered for what they needed to do. 8mm Kurz is a workable if inefficient compromise between 9mm Luger and 8mm Mauser. The smaller cartridge also allowed for a lighter, simpler and cheaper weapon. You couldn't go all the way and make a blowback system like in an SMG but you also didn't need the beefy three lug of the Mauser. 

Reports from units equipped with StGs loved them. Now anyone could take up, temporarily, the role of the MG and suppress the enemy at range. This gave flexibility to units. No longer did you have down time where firepower was greatly diminished while the MG squad was relocating, reloading or changing barrels. Someone could pick up the slack. You could also press advances faster not having to wait for the MG to catch up. And more commonly at this stage in the war, more effectively pull off orderly retreats. In their specific roles the StG was not as good as a rifle or SMG but it was good enough at both. 

What is really interesting is that the Soviets independently happened upon the same solution in the AK but came about it from the opposite direction. The Red Army loved its SMGs and used them liberally in the second world war. They wanted to maintain that volume of fire but extend the useful range.

Most people want higher resolution first and high refresh second. We should only be recommending edge case setups if people state up front that they want it. Otherwise it's bad advice."
WarCollege,felc88p,t3_epk6p9,1579218773.0,"Some of it was fine, some of it was crap and some of it was very good. This is true of most nations. Generally any world class military will have most of its gear fall under the ""good enough"" category and you will have outliers in both exceptional and sub standard.

The Germans weren't an exception here. Their technical skills are often exaggerated but others have already written great explanations as to why that is. So I will just list some good examples of great, good and poor equipment.


Optics: Zeiss was and still is one of the best optics firms in the world. The optics were by the standards of the day exceptionally bright and clear. The story of the German optics industry actually dates back to before the formation of the country. The irony is while the optics were great, the scopes they were implemented in weren't necessarily. Generally speaking, the scopes that equipped panzers didn't have the best fov or magnification. It wasn't terrible but the T34's primary scope was higher powered and had a wider field of view. The clarity and light accumulation were probably more important at the end of the day. This didn't carry over to rifle scopes though. With no exception, everyone's rifle scopes during the war were terrible by modern standards. They were fragile, easy to lose zero and fogged all the time. Properly sealed, nitrogen filled tubes weren't perfected until post war. I think Leupold was the first to get it to market. Ironically the tanks were never equipped with a stereoscopic range finder even though the navy had used them since before WW1 and the Stugs had them. For some reason the tanks never got them. 


Engines: They had a lot going for them here. The Rolls Royce Merlin is often listed as one of the best piston engines of the war and has legendary status but it is less advanced than its German counterpart the DB 600 series. That engine was a wealth of technological firsts. It had a working direct fuel injection system, sodium filled valves and a water/methanol injection system that allowed for higher boost pressures for a short period. These technologies eventually found their way into motorsport and the same Daimler engineers who made the DB 600 ended up working for Mercedes' race teams post war. Until the infamous crash at Le Mans in 1955 the silver arrows dominated European motorsport and made Sterling Moss's career.

The same can be said of jets. The Me-262 was powered by the Junkers Jumo 004 turbo jet. The British Derwent was a centrifugal turbine, it compresses air in a similar manner to a turbocharger. The Jumo was an axial turbine which is how modern jet engines work. It did have a lot of problems though. It's development was rushed and it lacked the high temperature alloys needed which made it unreliable and gave the engine a short life. Still, it was the way forward and directly influenced future engine designs.

Tanks: a mixed bag. The Pz3 and Pz4 were good designs. Especially the Pz4 which proved to be a very adaptable and long lived design. The Tiger isn't as good or as bad as many say. It's very misunderstood. It was intended to be a niche vehicle used specifically to break defensive positions which would then be exploited by other tanks. Reliability and range weren't considered important because it wasn't supposed to go far. The reality of war changed that. The panther is a lot like the Jumo jet. It had a lot of innovative ideas but suffered from rushed development. Some consider it to be the first main battle tank. The tiger 2 was completely unnecessary and the follow on designs that were being drawn up, Maus, E series etc showed that German tank development was going down the wrong path.

Rocketry: in terms of larger rockets they were definitely world leaders. Werner and his team as well as the plans and hardware of the V-2 project jumpstarted both the US and Soviet programs. With smaller rockets such as air to ground the allies were farther ahead."
WarCollege,fel4vc1,t1_fek0zkf,1579214105.0,"I'd argue that the Panther's issues mostly amount to lack of proper development which was caused by the pressures and austerity of war. They never did fix the differential but when the army needs tanks yesterday and the supplies of quality strategic materials are limited you get results like that.

The Me-262 had a similar problem. It's axial flow turbines were state of the art, the British and Americans were still using centrifugal turbines. But they lacked the materials to produce proper high temp steel and they lacked the time to develop the engines further. Gas turbines were very high maintenance and had short MTBF even post war for years to come. If the Me-262 had existed in peace time it likely would not have passed acceptance trials.

Sturmgewehr was innovative in how it changed infantry doctrine but the weapon itself was very crude. They were designed to be disposable in a way. Headspace was set at manufacture and could not be adjusted afterwords. It involved soldering shims to the bolt. The factory workers would pick from a selection of different sized shims and install the appropriate one. Because of this StG bolts are not interchangeable. They were also lightly built and designed to only last a few thousand rounds. Again, it would not be accepted in peace time. HMG have been trying to get a reproduction StG to market for years now and there are some very informative videos on YouTube where they go in depth on how much of the gun had to be redesigned to meet quality and reliability standards not to mention manufacturing standards. Sadly the repro seems to be vaporware at this point. I guess the project was more difficult than they had imagined.

HK who are essentially the reincarnation of Mauser's small arms division did eventually refine the StG 45s system into something practical as you said. The HK 33 is in many ways a sturmgewehr that works. I have the civilian version and by WW2 standards it would be a world beater. The platform is inferior to the AR though."

I think there is definite value in making synths and controllers like this because a large portion of what shapes the sound of a given instrument is not just the tonal quality, but how it's played. A common pitfall musicians can run into when using samples with standard keyboard controllers is that they won't play like a musician with the real thing would.

The US has not tried to sabotage UK agency or their ability to domestically produce weapons. The British did that one to themselves through decades of short sighted government decisions influenced by the massive debt incurred from nearly a century of massive naval spending and losing their empire combined with two world wars.

TSR-2 was obsolete by the time it was canceled. This happened a lot in the era because technology was moving at a very rapid pace. For every TSR-2 the British cry about the US has multiple similar projects that were canceled for the same reason.

Why do they us American ICBMs? Because by the time their aerospace industry received the funding to develop their own missiles the US ones were a generation ahead. It comes down to money again. The UK government could not afford to continue investing into military RnD post war and the companies had to struggle to survive. It's not an environment conducive to developing state of the art weapons.

And the state of affairs doesn't support your argument either. In almost every other way the UK military uses UK systems. The ships are domestic. Their systems are domestic. The tanks and other AFVs are also domestic. And those industries were able to survive because they didn't evolve like aerospace. It got very expensive very fast. And in the 50s-70s when all of the big projects were about delivering nukes in higher and faster forms there isn't much in the way of export. The more conventional weapons like main battle tanks and destroyers are easy to sell and sold well. How many nations bought centurion? Who would have bought TSR-2? The only nations that would have had a use for it were the Soviets and Americans. You aren't selling to the Soviets and the Americans already had their own projects.

As for CATOBAR on the QEs that's another example of short sighted government decisions. There is no reason they couldn't be CATOBAR but the decision was made for STOBAR because of cost. They kept the option in to refit them but when that was revised it was too expensive."

Eh, it can be if you have a lack of normal length runways. But the B sacrifices performance and payload for that. Most buyers are getting it for naval use which makes sense because most nations don't have CATOBAR carriers. 


>Without it you are getting a jet that will be for all practical purposes leased from the US government. F35 is so sophisticated that Finns would have to acquire it under Israeli rules and have sufficient tech base at home to deal with it and they still would be dependent on things like ALIS.

How is the B any different than the A in this regard? 

>Of course it is not a better investment. It's a high-cost buy-in to a club where you have your back-row seat and take instructions from the boss.

It's definitely a better long term investment because unlike all of the 4th gen fighters it will be relevant for decades to come. It will also have many upgrade and sustainment options since it is being widely adopted. With large production also comes lower costs not just in acquisition but also in parts and support. In 20 years the F-35 will be like the F-16 is today. 


>Buying Gripen E is the optimal decision as far as economics goes. Finland's problem is Russia, not America or China. They also need economic leverage over Sweden which is their main electronics supplier. That is more important than some flashy new plane.

Pretty sure Sweden would have leverage over Finland if they bought the Gripen. Its essentially single sourced everything. Who else are they going to go to for parts and support? With the F-35 you have options. You wont have to go to America for support. The British, Japanese, Israelis etc etc are all going to have skin in the game. 

>By the time Russia will have a problematic air force Finland will be able to use Saab's role in Tempest and possibly FCAS to look to 6th gen systems - especially the unmanned part - which are much more promising to a country such as Finland. The cost of 50 jets is insane for a country of about 5 million people!

You can't count on that so far out. I give 50/50 chances the program either goes nowhere or gets folded into another one to maximize resources. Combat aircraft get more expensive every day. F-35 required international cooperation to complete. 6th gen will be even worse whenever that happens.

LessCredibleDefence,fdorpdi,t1_fdoo1vv,1578611392.0,"The problem wasn't with SM-2. In fact the only contributing factor that was technical was that Aegis recycled names assigned to contacts. This alone would not have caused the disaster if the operators officers didn't have several operational and training issues. There was confusion over time zones on posted civilian flight paths so the crew were unable to properly compare planned flights with the data they were receiving. And nobody failed to notice or consider the naming issue.

Disasters are rarely caused by a single failure. It usually takes multiple failires. If anyone had been aware of the reuse of designations or had taken the time to note that the aircraft did not match the flight path or location that that designation had moments before then disaster could have been avoided. Being under stress no doubt contributed well but that's what rigorous training is for. They were over reliant on a system that was at the time new and didn't fully understand this. The UI issues were fixed but you can bet every western navy included a case study of this event in their training.

I also think it's a bit presumptuous to assume that Tor has the same flaw that Aegis did. The issue had nothing to do with it being the 80's and had everything to do with bad software design. Or are you going to claim that Buk has the same flaw and that caused the loss of MH17?

The way things used to stand is that there are three common types of energy weapons on warships, turbo lasers, laser cannons and ion cannons. Each has a different purpose and role. Turbo lasers are large and powerful weapons meant for ship to ship combat. ISDs have a lot of them. Laser cannons operate by the same principles, both are really just big blasters, but are smaller and faster firing. They are meant for anti star fighter use. Not big enough to do much damage to another ship but lethal against smaller craft. Ion cannons are special. They don't deal physical damage like the other two. Instead the wreck shields and electrical systems. In ESB the rebels use a massive ground based ion cannon on hoth to knock out an ISD. Ion weapons vary in size just like blaster based ones. From pistols that are effective against droids all the way up to the Big Boi in ESB.

In the prequels we have a jedi order that has existed for thousands of years which no doubt has accumulated a massive knowledge of the force and the ways it can be used. So it makes sense that various jedi would have interesting abilities. There's an educational system built around it. In the original trilogy Luke starts knowing nothing and is trained by Obi Wan and then Yoda so we learn of the abilities with him but the powers he gains are limited by his training, experience and what Yoda and Obi Wan have time to teach him. He didn't get years of formal instruction with many masters.

In the new movies not only is the educational framework of the Jedi long gone but we also really don't see Rey getting a lot of training. The only master to learn from is Luke and he teaches her nothing. Sure there's the bit with Leia at the beginning of ROSW but Leia wasn't really a proper Jedi. Luke trained her but then she stopped. And her knowledge of the force would be limited to what Luke taught her before she quit. And what he knew at that time which had to be limited. So where did she learn to heal or teleport objects? I can believe Luke rediscovering or inventing new powers over the years, he is really strong in the force, perhaps the strongest ever. But Rey is a Mary Sue at the end of the day.
