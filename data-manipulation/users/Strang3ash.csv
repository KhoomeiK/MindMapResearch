bipolar,ffyks1w,t3_ev0h2p,1580348786.0,"No worries, just message me whenever. I think it’s dope and I’m looking forward to it."
bipolar,ffyjkaj,t1_ffyh2z5,1580347954.0,I mean I’d be willing to buy it off of you for sure. I just wanted to see what it would look like. I believe the colors would be way more drastic with a white background.
bipolar,ffy6hnk,t1_ffsmzej,1580339491.0,"I really like this. 
I like the detail you put in both sides showing the subtle difference between mania and depression. Can I request something? If you don’t mind, can you do this again but make the person a black silhouette and the background white?"
bipolar,ffw7n1p,t1_ffw74cd,1580288192.0,"Uncontrollable thoughts, they won’t stop. I gotta work in 2 hours I guess I give up now"
bipolar,ffw7j3n,t1_ffw60bp,1580288033.0,Same to you.

bipolar,fe5trdw,t1_fe4my58,1578874753.0,"Thanks man I appreciate that but it’s not a matter of money, it’s getting the prescription. New doctors, malpractice fears, lack of emergency psychiatrists, and small town mindsets. All I can do rn is wait."
