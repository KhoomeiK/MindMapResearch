infertility,ffervwn,t3_et8fd0,1579862520.0,Going into an egg retrieval this weekend with only 4 follicles. I had 12 my last cycle just two months ago. I thought I finally found a medication protocol that worked for me but here I am again with what will probably be another shitty cycle. I know it only takes 1 but the odds are not at all in my favor and I just want this to be over.
IVF,ffdv3hs,t1_ffdu69j,1579829670.0,So do you mean a shady clinic will lead you to believe an embryo can be adopted knowing full well it can’t be as a way to collect fees from you along the way? Or that embryos are being adopted out without meeting the requirements?

I did a fresh transfer on my last cycle. Resulted in a pregnancy but I unfortunately miscarried. My insurance requires that I do a fresh transfer with any egg retrieval so I don't really have a choice. But if I did I would probably opt for fresh transfers. I don't get many blasts, unfortunately, so PGS testing and freezing doesn't really benefit me all that much because it's not like I get to choose the best blast or freeze leftovers...I just have to work with what I got."

IVF,fepb7yk,t1_fep95a7,1579316296.0,I hope the vitamins and the Lupron work for you. It seems like such a crap shoot. I know how hard it is to have difficulty retrieving good quality eggs so I feel for you. I just started my fourth cycle (ugh) but my last/third IVF round was more encouraging. That time around I had 12 eggs retrieved and eight fertilized. Everything looked good but unfortunately kind of fell apart around day 4. We only had two that got to the blast stage. Wound up transferring one fresh embryo and PGS for the other.  I got pregnant but quickly miscarried. The embryo we tested came back abnormal so once again we wound up with nothing. The results were more encouraging though so we decided to try again. I took vitamins and did acupuncture for about three months before that cycle and I like to think they helped. I also took much lower doses of meds though (100 Gonal & 75 Menopur) so it’s hard to say which did the trick. This time around I’ll have been taking vitamins for almost six months so I have my fingers crossed they’ve “soaked in” by now. I had to stop acupuncture last month though because it was too expensive. =(  The things we go through!
IVF,fep8gtp,t3_eq95ml,1579314489.0,"I’m 39. For my second IVF cycle I used 40 MD of Lupron (20 2x each day) for about 9 days and added 600 IUs of Gonal-F around day 3. Retrieved 8 eggs. Only three were mature enough for ICSI. The remaining two fertilized abnormally so the cycle yielded no blast.

If you’re wondering, my first cycle was 450 Gonal-F combined with 150 IUs Menopur. That cycle didn’t yield any blasts either. We only got 4 eggs and the one that fertilized stopped developing by day 3."
IVF,fdznm54,t3_enf1mc,1578792057.0,That’s an Antagonistic protocol. Intended to promote follicle stimulation to produce as many mature eggs as possible. An ovulation suppressor is introduced about halfway through to prevent ovulation until your doctor feels enough eggs are mature for retrieval.
IVF,fdzme36,t1_fdyit1a,1578791675.0,"I know - the money and time spent on this adds up so quick.

Sure. I got zero blasts with two rounds of aggressive protocols (1st: Daily Gonal-F at 450+150 Menopur, 2nd: 600 Gonal-F + 80 Lupron). Between those two rounds I got 12 eggs. The 4 that fertilized stopped dividing by day 3.

With the scaled back protocol (Daily Gonal-F at 100 + 75 Menopur) I got 12 eggs and 8 fertilized. Six stopped dividing around day 4-5 so they were somehow “stronger”. I transferred one blast fresh on day 5. I got pregnant but miscarried within a week. The last blast was biopsied for PGS testing on day 6 but unfortunately it came back abnormal."

IVF,fdxnp4h,t1_fdxknnj,1578770977.0,"Got it. IVF is all about cycling and managing hormones. The timing of your consultations with your wife’s BC schedule is ideal if she will be off next week. I would continue this week’s dose of birth control so you do not disrupt the regulated hormone cycle she is on before you know how to proceed. Some IVF protocols utilize BC to regulate hormones anyway so your wife may be instructed to stay on it. If they tell her to stop she’ll start a new cycle with a clean slate. Since you are having multiple consultations next week, hopefully you get a consensus on which approach to take. Good luck."
IVF,fdxfxr6,t1_fdx6oyp,1578768358.0,"No, I did not. As I understand it, PGD is performed to determine if you carry genetic conditions that would negatively impact the health of a pregnancy or infant.

IVF,fdx5e5h,t3_en9g6m,1578765520.0,"This is a difficult journey to be sure, especially since there are so many differing opinions from doctors and scientists about what works. I’m 39 and have had difficulty retrieving a decent amount eggs and I switched clinics because I was unhappy with my first doctor/clinic. I’m actually opposite of you though because I was on an aggressive medication protocol and wound up getting much better quality eggs when I scaled back the stims at the second clinic. It’s all about quality, not quantity, but you put a lot into this so I understand the urge to want a lot of eggs to increase your odds. Not sure if that’s helpful. You provided a lot of info so I’m not sure what specific guidance you are seeking. Hopefully you can get some feedback or commiserate with someone in your exact situation. Unfortunately sometimes it seems like we’re all dealing with exceptions.

infertility,fczxd2a,t3_ejqe3x,1578110247.0,"You’re not silly for wanting to be aggressive at 42. If IUI doesn’t work, your doctor will have no idea why and will spend precious time speculating.  IVF doesn’t give you all the answers but you’ll have much more transparency each step of the way to help figure out what to adjust going forward. Each assisted cycle takes at least two months because you’ll do IUI or IVF one month, then you’ve got to wait for your next period to arrive (or not) to know if it worked, then if it doesn’t you will have to schedule another consult with your doctor to discuss next steps and who knows how long that will take.

IVF,fcfwlh4,t3_eh4qi4,1577634380.0,"I’m so sorry, I know how much this hurts. I was diagnosed as a poor responder. My first IVF I was on 450 IUI of Gonal F and 150 IUs Menopur for about 9 days and added 250 Ganarillex towards the end. I only got 4 eggs but only two were mature. This two fertilized but one only made it to day 3 so we never got to the transfer stage. Second time I did IVF I was on 600 IUs of Gonal and 40 IUs of Lupron for about 9 days. We retrieved 8 egg but only 3 were mature and fertilized. None of them made it past the second day so we didn’t have an embryo to transfer for our second round either. My doctor wanted to keep increasing my dosage.

I switched clinics for the Third IVF to try a doctor who took a different approach to poor responders. I was on 100 IU Gonal and 75 IU Menopur for eleven days. Added Ganarillex towards the end. I also took CoQ10, DHEA, L-Argenine, Inositol, and Omega 3 for three months in addition to the prenatal vitamins I was already taking. We retrieved 12 eggs with that round and nine were mature. Eight fertilized. We only got two blasts but the eight zygotes made it to day four. Unfortunately I miscarried the embryo that was transferred and the PGS testing on the remaining one came back abnormal so I probably miscarried because the other one was abnormal too. It’s a lot to go through to get to the same result but at least our odds were better with the last round and I learned that a low-dose protocol works for me. And, we spent about $3,000 less with the last protocol because we didn’t need as much medication."

Everything takes so much longer than you think and before you know it years have gone by. I’m happy to hear you’re 29 - hopefully that means you have a longer runway than I did when I was in your predicament. I sought acupuncture and my acupuncturists theory was that my egg quality was compromised because the fibroids were “stealing” blood from my ovaries so the egg cells weren’t getting the nourishment they needed all those years I had fibroids. I don’t know if I buy that, because blood is produced as needed but it’s not a good thought to have. The notion that my ovaries somehow got compromised during surgery also haunt me. I’ll never really know and everyone is different, but coulda shoulda woulda is a bitch so I just fell for you because I know you’ll do what you believe is best - that’s all you can do really. I just hope you don’t end up with the same problems."
Fibroids,fca8rq3,t3_egrhbe,1577564816.0,"Hi - Unfortunately I don’t have the answer you’re looking for but I wanted to share my experience because it may be relevant to you. I had fibroids for about ten years. During that time I had four hysteroscopies to remove fibroids that were growing in the uterine cavity. That helped with the bleeding but it did not remedy the fibroids that were growing within the uterine wall and outside the uterus. I started trying for a baby when I was 35 (I had had the hysteroscopies by then) and after a year of trying my husband and I sought fertility treatment. We did a couple rounds of IUI with no success and my fertility doctor at the time told me the fibroids may have changed the shape of my uterus/tubes and was probably preventing sperm from reaching the eggs. I had an open myomectomy to remove all the fibroids when I was 37. I had to wait six months to heal before I could try for a baby again. Nine months later (because fertility treatment take a long time when you factor in scheduling, insurance preapprovals, life...) I was 38 so we went right into IVF. We’ve struggled to get viable embryos, likely because of my age. I got pregnant with the one viable embryo we did transfer but unfortunately I miscarried at five weeks, likely because the embryo wasn’t viable. The pregnancy was encouraging though because I wasn’t sure if my uterus would be accepting to implantation but apparently it was.

What I’m getting at is I was fixated on the health of my uterus when I struggled to get pregnant. I was sure if we were having issues it was because my uterus was messed up. Whether or not the distortion of my uterus had anything to do with our infertility, I’ll never know. The low frequency of sex because of my constant, inconsistent bleeding certainly didn’t help. The time I spent addressing my uterus cost me precious time and egg quality, which is the most important factor for fertility. The uterus is a ridiculously resilient organ - it is designed to recuperate. I definitely had issues to address on that front but If I could do anything differently, I would have retrieved eggs and got embryos on ice before my myomectomy. I also would not have wasted time with IUI and pushed back on the doctor when he kept pressing me to try it when I told him I was concerned about my age. Unfortunately with the way my insurance works putting embryos on ice without an immediate embryo transfer would have cost significantly more, but in retrospect it would have been worth it.  If you can address your uterus and the time dealing with it will steal from you, do try."
