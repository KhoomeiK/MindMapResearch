AskReddit,ffi8j43,t1_ffi7w8d,1579967845.0,I moved in with a girlfriend after I sold it. We recently broke up so I bought a house. I bought a much nicer house that obviously costs more but I was able to put over 20% down with the money I made and still have cash left over.

He asked and I said I would help since I had a truck and he didn't have any friends in town.  We get done loading the big stuff and I'm taking a break while he goes back in for some of the small stuff.  His neighbor was outside and politely offered me a beer which I accepted.  A single 12 oz beer which I finished and then got back to helping move.  He ran to our boss first thing Monday morning to tell her I was drinking and driving while helping him move.  We weren't friends after that little stunt, I'm not sure what he had to gain by doing that."

I bought a house for $178,000 in 2013.  I lived in it, paid the mortgage every month, upgraded it a little, and took care of it for 6 years and then sold it in 2019 for $287,000.

I disagree that your neighbor parking their broken down car in their lawn for eternity, or painting their house Raiders colors doesn't impact your homes value.  It absolutely does, your house is only worth what someone is willing to pay, most people don't want to live next to a crazy person or garbage dump."

golf,fedl5mf,t1_fedkcwq,1579014243.0,"There are several things I've kind of figured out over the years that have drastically improved accuracy and ball striking.  

I used to just hit the ball and try to help it in the air and this caused a bad slice, now I really swing down on the ball, nothing feels better than a compressed golf ball and I have a nice repeatable draw, unless I really want to hit a cut, then I have to put a little more thought into it.  

Tightening up my swing was everything.  I see people who have so much movement when they swing, parts that shouldn't be moving.  I try to make my arms feel like they are the lever that's attached to me and I let my core swing the club.  

Play a ball that fits you and play it consistently.  You don't have to play Pro V1's or a really nice ball, but how are you ever going to have consistency around the greens if you're always switching balls around?

Don't be afraid to just aim at the middle of the green.  I get called a boring golfer a lot because I make a lot of easy 2 putt pars.  Hit the green first, worry about the pin second.

I'm by no means a pro, but these things have really helped me improve by leaps and bounds in a few short years."
