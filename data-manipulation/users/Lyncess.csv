cats,fcv1fz6,t1_fctv9r3,1577992669.0,"I think it's entirely on their personalities, we had a female, brought in a stray female kitten, it's been years and they don't love each other but don't hate each other either. 
Moved out, adopted two female littermates, they love each other and love the younger of the first two (we take them together occasionally, the oldest one would rather just ignore every cat).
On the other hand, I had a friend's male cat over once and they turned a little bit territorial on him. You never know with cats!"
cats,fco86uc,t3_ei7ums,1577825932.0,"She's so cute! looks a little like one of mine. There's no point of return now, she's gonna turn you into a cat person forever."
cats,fc8h3m4,t1_fc8dvf9,1577534765.0,"I have two rescues back at my parent's and because I could no longer live in a place without cats we adopted two littermates when we moved out. After that when we leave for more than a night I take mine to my parent's with their ""cousins"" and having the four of them there is not bad at all, they get along really well... so I may be worrying about nothing but I just don't know how many cats per square meter are ok, our apartment isn't that big ^^U. That being said there's no chance I could refuse if he brings over another furr ball, don't let him know!

By the way, kudos to you and your husband for being so awesome giving a family to all of them :)"
