They are also younger, and obesity tends to increase in danger over time (hence why type 2 diabetes used to be called adult onset diabetes). Lots of fat 20 and 30 year olds have good lab scores but it catches up to them."
facepalm,ffj06oq,t1_ffiu0es,1579987071.0,"Well technically yes, because whether it's 215 of fat or muscle it's still more mass that the heart needs to pump blood through, straining it. However 215 of muscle is better because it's less mass compared to fat, and they get the benefits from exercise. But large athletes can have health problems too because too much of anything causes organs/bones/etc to work harder, even if those muscles can do impressive feats."

Most places it works out great, but when something happens in a badly run place, FEMA just can't pull 5,000 workers with knowledge of the area and it's resources out of thin air. But mostly the complaint here is that FEMA is giving 99% and being railed for not doing enough, while PR can't do 1% and is claiming blamlessness.

I would need an actual step by step plan on how he plans to A- pass the bills with opposition from Republicans and B- get uncooperative companies to follow them without a decade of delays and lobbing to counteract it, before I'd consider him.

Improving workers rights can let families make the choice best for them (and afford it either way) without chaining anyone down to traditional gender roles.
