depression,ff4c0wh,t3_erfmu2,1579560067.0,Wow this gives me hope. That sounds literally amazing I could cry.
pornfree,fekyalx,t1_fekxkc9,1579210113.0,"No problem man. The streak is gone, but it is not like your brain has gone into full porn mode again. To be honest your brain will not be that affected. But you have to treat the peeks seriously or you will just keep peeking and it will lead to a relapse. I speak from experience, trust me. You are in control, you got this"
pornfree,fekuzzu,t1_fekqs4d,1579208156.0,Be honest with yourself. Did you really open the nsfw page accidentally? Or did you just want a peek?

depression,fek3ikk,t1_fehw9ot,1579191837.0,"Perhaps it is, but it doesn't matter. We have to take every suspected case of depression seriously just in case they are actually depressed. Or then doctors would end up turning away severely depressed people who they thought were just lazy"
depression,fehv8mp,t3_ep7s8c,1579124542.0,Anyone who says that is a bit rude to be honest and I would avoid them. If I knew someone was bad at conversation I would never say it to their face. That is a horrible thing to do.
depression,fehv61m,t3_ep8coo,1579124501.0,"Damn. I hope a miracle comes and saves you soon. 


But I must say you are strong enough. To stay strong and keep going after the way depression has been hitting you? That is strength."
depression,fehuvvq,t3_ep8wa2,1579124340.0,"I get you and I get your self doubt.


But there are hundreds of psychologists and scientists who have devoted their lives and millions of dollars to the study of depression and there is a worldwide consensus that depression exists."

pornfree,fehnusg,t3_ep7ius,1579120330.0,I would love to but unfortunately I have crippling social anxiety
depression,fehnrtf,t3_ep7q3y,1579120282.0,"I feel you. I think deep inside, I would love to go out, socialise, party etc. But I just have a crazy innate fear of being vulnerable and being rejected or failing and it has gotten so bad over the years. Now I have become socially awkward. I used to be so confident in my early teen years, popular, talking to girls etc. I was a great person and my life was looking so positive. But something clicked and now I am fucked.


But now I am slowly becoming an outcast.


And the worst part is - the way to cure it is by getting therapy and putting yourself in the social situations to cure it.


But that is like trying to fix a broken leg by running a marathon with it. It is just so hard.



Hope it gets better for you."
depression,fehlpj0,t3_ep7cu6,1579119089.0,Do what makes you happy
depression,fehf4zh,t1_feg9fmm,1579115258.0,What else does she say about it? What is the solution then? I have come to this conclusion too but I have no idea how to overcome it.
pornfree,fegatjd,t3_eowfi0,1579085388.0,You are a beast dude. You are the one in control now and the porn is the one trying to take it back. Keep fighting and stay strong.
depression,fees1co,t3_eosf5x,1579039980.0,"Maybe the job hopping is a symptom of something deeper.


I think the solution is to get professional help. Let the professionals sort this out. They are paid to help you. This doesn't have to be your life."
depression,feerrl6,t1_feerlci,1579039816.0,What the fuck lol? How can he says that if he has depression? Especially to his own child? What a strange situation honestly
depression,feeqlrq,t3_eos5at,1579039126.0,"Damn man. That is a tough situation and I don't have much advice to be honest. I have had those crazy family situations before and the screaming is the worst. The constant shouting and the anxiety that something serious might happen at any time is the worst. 



Encourage your brother to get mental help if he hasn't already. Maybe he just needs a supporting hand. 


Make sure to take your dogs for a walk and get them what they need. It will give you a break too.



Unfortunately you have to be strong and subtly help resolve this conflict in tiny ways, e.g. walking the dogs, doing the dishes etc. To help resolve my family issues I would do things like that. Just constantly be nice and don't go down to that level. Those little things really did help for me. 



The intimate relationships will never even work if your family is in a state like this, so don't worry about that for now too much. This is more important.



It is a tough situation, I wish you the best"
depression,feeppzz,t1_feepes7,1579038619.0,"That is very weird then. But someone has taken this effort to investigate you and make sure you are okay. You have proof of that. There is no denying now that someone out there cared enough about you to do this. 


To be honest I am jealous of that. Stay strong brother."
depression,feepgxr,t3_eorz5w,1579038474.0,"No man.. Please don't. There must be people who care for you. It will destroy them. If one of my family died right now I would be fucked inside.



Please get professional help. It is the light at the end of the tunnel.


Imagine if your plan for tomorrow morning was this :


You wake up at 7:00, energised and motivated. Happy. You make yourself a delicious breakfast that you have been craving and you drive to work on a nice sunny day. You like socialising with your colleagues and you say hi to everyone. You drive home and you start to pursue a project or hobby - maybe you want to make a robot, or learn how to paint, or play the piano, or just relax with a movie and a game. 



Imagine being free of these thoughts. Completely normal.




With professional help you can get there. Your life is not over man. The universe has something greater planned for you.




If you can weather this storm in your mind, you will become the storm. You are strong and this is not the way you go my friend."
depression,feeo1zb,t3_eor40n,1579037651.0,"Nice (?).  This is good but don't let it get to the point where you get underweight. 



I struggle with gaining weight. It is messed up but I wish I was overweight so I could gain muscle much more quickly."
depression,feenrfy,t3_eor48r,1579037482.0,This just shows they do care! They just were anxious or something was holding them back from saying it to you face to face. But in private they thought of you and wanted to help you.
depression,feenjq0,t3_eorr68,1579037357.0,"You can kill your depressed self painlessly by seeking professional help. 


Let the professionals do what they are paid to do. Please man there is light at the end of the tunnel. I know all this advice sounds empty and meaningless but some people do truly care for you and if they don't now, people will in the future. I would if I knew you."
depression,feen9gz,t3_eophbs,1579037194.0,"That is so hard man. You are so fucking strong and not many people have your strength. No one here can provide good advice on the family issues because they are very tough to deal with and they must be dealt with on a professional level. 


But for your other problems - don't worry too much about your weight. I know it can be annoying and you see yourself as ""fat"" but most of the time you are not. I used to think I was but now that I look back, I was so skinny and I looked stupid. Now I am trying hard to gain weight and I wish I could be fatter. This is 100% honesty I am not making it up. Fat=muscle. It is genuinely not the end of the world. Hitting the gym when you are fatter = lots of muscle. That is why people bulk up all the time.



Please seek all the professional help you can get. They are the professionals and will know what to do. If they offer you drugs, TAKE them. If you are truly in such a dark state, how can these drugs that will probably make you feel better, make you worse?





I recently completed my A-Levels (maths, further, chem, physics) and did very well. I don't mean to sound arrogant but I feel like I know some of the best ways to actually revise. If you ever need any help I will be so happy to help. I know it is not much but I just want to offer some sort of help. Ask anything, anytime and I promise I will respond ASAP. I can also help with any university applications if you are doing that."
depression,feemf7l,t3_eorigf,1579036710.0,"Unfortunately your father has been very horrible here. Most people don't understand what depression is like. But most of them try to understand and are accepting. But then there are those who think you control it and that you can just switch it off, like your father.



I am very appreciative of what I have. If not for my family, home and general fortune in life I would probably have committed suicide or given up. 



It is a stupid mindset to have of ""be appreciative of what you have"" etc. Most lottery winners end up dead after a few years even though they received a crazy, fortunate bonus in life. Many rich people have depression. 



But in a way it can be helpful to think a bit about what you have. Sometimes people find it helpful to write a gratitude journal, or things like that."
depression,feelp27,t3_eork3x,1579036289.0,"That is exactly why I struggle with losing my religion. If I do, life will just become meaningless and empty."
depression,feelkqp,t3_eoqzz1,1579036217.0,"Like the other commenter said. There is no special diet. All these diets are the same thing in different ways:


use more calories than you eat.



That is it. There is no special formula.


The hard part is overcoming yourself, the mental issues that come with obesity and the struggle to make such a drastic change. Patience is also hard. The results will take months, years to come. 


I know it's hard and I have a lot of respect for obese people because I can empathise with how hard it is. But you have to keep trying. One day it will click and you will get into the swing of it."
depression,feehq6p,t3_eoqv51,1579033984.0,"I have been in a similar situation. In a college dorm. I have closed myself up and avoided everyone and I haven't seen most of my housemates in weeks. I eat out all the time and I probably look like a fkin weirdo. I just sleep all day and no one has a clue how fucked up I am.



The advice is to take small steps. Just eat or drink something. Even if it is shitty food, just eat something. I don't have much more than that, but you need to stay strong and keep fighting the depression that is pulling you into this pit"
depression,feehcfq,t1_feegu9y,1579033767.0,"No problem, good luck and just keep  the therapy in the back of your mind. It may take a long time to muster the courage to do it, but eventually you will have to before it spirals out of control. Let the experts who are paid to do it do it for you, not you. Good luck and stay strong!"
depression,feeh81s,t3_eoql7x,1579033697.0,"That is fucked up and you should leave him. Suicide is never the answer. To actually say that to someone? I can't even imagine doing that. I would fight to the end to save someone if they told me that. 



Try different pills and perhaps a different therapist. Usually people need to try many different pills before they get one they like.



From what you have said you need to leave him asap because that is not right. It can be easy for the definition of 'normal' to get warped when you are in a bad mental state. This is really not normal."
depression,feegq27,t3_eoqpe9,1579033408.0,"Me too man. I know how hard it is. And then people just talk normally and you think how do they do it? and it makes you feel weird and it stresses you out more etc etc.


But there is a solution to all of it. CBT and going to get professional help. Don't kill yourself because there is a solution to your problems. We just have to go through the pain and anxiety and get help.



The problem is, I know that it is hard to get professional help when you are socially anxious and in this state of mind. But it is the only way forward to get out of this hellhole.



Tomorrow I am going to call a doctor and set up an appointment. I am dreading it and dreading how the next few weeks of my life will be like but it is the only way. I am sick of living like this and I would do anything to be normal again, even if it takes 600 panic attacks to get there. 


Let's do this man. You are stronger than you know and you have gotten this far. Help is out there and we just have to get it."
depression,fedyf33,t1_fedvutl,1579022523.0,"It changed their lives sure but I am saying there would only be a few foods that were actually affecting them, e.g. maybe gluten, or lactose, or just random specific foods e.g. cauliflower. 


By only eating meat they eliminated EVERYTHING and so they eliminate those problematic foods. But really that is just lazy and you should take the time to eliminate those foods so you can have an actually healthy diet. Literally no reputable scientist would support their all meat diet. It is just so nonsensical and I am surprised he has that diet given his intelligence.


The red meat study could be legit, I cba to look at it. But all the health organisations and most people are on the side that red meat is bad for you. And I would trust them rather than the studies that support it because they could be funded by the meat industry. Plus the cancer thing is not the only issue - there are also steroids, animal rights issues etc. Look at the bottom of that article which talks about climate issues.


It is just risky to eat meat. Some say it's bad, some say it's fine. But I would rather not risk colon cancer and just eat the proven good foods that can be just as delicious provided you put some effort in to make them good.



The best thing is to stick to the reliable foods that EVERYONE agrees are fine, e.g. fruit, veg, whole foods. Then remove any foods causing you issues, e.g. gluten. Then treat yourself to a piece of red meat every so often and introduce fish. Or just remove both and go full vegan.



Who wants to eat like dogshit and then substitute their diet for vitamins? Nobody. Even then some people would argue that you cannot actually substitute a diet for vitamins anyway. So once again, it is better to be safe and go for real food.



I do 100% agree thought that diet plays a key role in mental health issues."
depression,fed6mvy,t3_eogx53,1579001405.0,"It is very important, humans are social creatures and need social interaction and affection. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying to you and themselves or a psychopath"
depression,fed5yy0,t3_eojn5h,1579000530.0,"I 100% agree that diet is a big factor. But that meat diet is utterly ridiculous and stupid. It probably did make them feel better, but here's why:



Imagine in your diet you eat broccoli, cauliflower, chicken, rice etc etc. Only a few of those foods were a problem. By eating meat, you eliminate all of those foods and you are certain to eliminate the problematic foods. But now, you miss out on all the nutrients of the foods that were not making you feel like crap. 



The best thing to do is to start your diet fresh from good whole foods, e.g. brown rice, lots of veg etc. When you feel bad after a meal, note it down and look at the stuff you ate. Then narrow it down to a certain food, e.g. beans that make you feel like shit and eliminate it and see if you feel better. Repeat.


By eating meat they are just lazy and eliminated everything and happened to eliminate the problematic foods. They miss out on so many nutrients and plus, they are eating lots of red meat which is proven to increase your risk of cancers.



I am surprised that Jordan Peterson who seems quite intelligent (he is, whether you agree on his views or not) would have a diet like that."
pornfree,fed505x,t3_eoir6q,1578999163.0,"This happened to me once - I was on a long streak but months of peeking and barely touching it led to watching it fully. Then I relapsed and binged hard for months.


I would say just do a fresh start and restart your streak now with NO peeking and pure 100% freedom from it. 


YOu are not a joke because you still have not fully succumbed. It is natural to peek and make excuses and do this. 



You can do this and it is better to try harder now rather than after a relapse where it will feel much more hopeless.



You are strong man and you are better than this. The road to recovery is not straight, it is long and winding and bumpy."
depression,feavg3q,t3_eoar4x,1578952569.0,"The way to cure it is to get professional help. But it is hard to have the courage to do it. Fix this now before it gets worse and you start to get used to this feeling.

DecidingToBeBetter,fe9jxmx,t1_fe94mg5,1578938454.0,Yeah this ismy biggest issue. I can't do anything because I don't want to show any weakness or vulnerability. It is brutally hard to get past. Especially with social anxiety ... the best way is therapy but to let out all your emotions and shit one to one? That sounds impossible
pornfree,fe9hmoc,t1_fe9gd5q,1578937634.0,"Thanks man I appreciate it a lot. The process will be so painful for me. I have crippling social anxiety and I am scared of rejection and leaving myself vulnerable and I used porn to cope with it. But I just have to face it or I will never be ok. 


Good luck to you too man"
pornfree,fe9ap3q,t3_eo5vem,1578935924.0,Definitely agree. I have filled in my loneliness for a long time with porn. I have no friends and no intimacy. And I use porn to cope. It is even reflected in my fetishes which I won't speak about.
