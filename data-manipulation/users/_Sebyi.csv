Advice,ffnng6i,t1_ffnibhp,1580068163.0,"Helpful. Yes I told them and found the little guy, who hit the first punch, close around the place where the fight happened. My father talked to him and asked him his side. And the kid lied and said I swear him (which I didn't even talked to). I also told some friends to find him and intimidate him (friends who could literally beat the 4 dudes to death if they wanted). Somehow, the dude found out about it and decided to apologise to me on Instagram. He said I swore about his dead mother (which I did not, I didn't even talked to him that day). I decided to accept his apologies, even tho he probably lied. Also told a couple of friends about the incident. I decided to take what he said as a confusion. Anyways, he was the only one of em 4 from who I could recognise his name (actually a nickname). He also said that he would talk to the other guys about it. Also my parents and I decided to not to go to a police station, since out of 14 punches straight in my face I didn't get any injuries, other than a broken lip, whose cause was that it hit my teeth; patetic af btw. But I would take to the asshole that kinda started this whole mess. He tried to impress his girl by talking sh*t about my hair, saying that it's for girls, and pointed to his head saying that his hair was ""real men hair"", and after I told him to stop, he started talking trash. Then the little guy stepped in and the fight started. You know what ? I wouldn't take him to the cops. I would beat him up. Maybe he's gonna come around the park where I am with all of my friends, then we're going to see who he's gonna impress."
