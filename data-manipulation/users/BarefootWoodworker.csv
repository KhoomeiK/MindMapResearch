WorldOfWarships,fffd7nj,t1_ffevrdz,1579881382.0,"I’ve found with most CVs in my DD (a conceal Lightning) I just turn off AA and secondaries. The secondaries are like pissing in a typhoon, and since my air detection range is 2.5 KM but AA reaches out to 5.2, it attracts unwanted attention. 

I still enjoy non-CV games more just because I don’t have to hunt for some useless tin can launching mosquitoes everywhere. That and in my experience, too few CV players actually get how to help  eg, spot and show their team the entire fucking map. 

I’ve had a handful of games where the CV was top notch; that ended up like seal clubbing, and I was bottom tier in that game. I’m pretty sure that was the same game where I got something like 184 shots into a Yamato."
WorldOfWarships,fffbxmc,t1_ffept19,1579880582.0,"Fuck. Radar. 

It’s like every damned time I cap, some fucking Moskva halfway across the map radars me and I have to skitter out of the cap. 

While they hide behind an island. 

I have no problem with radarwhen I’ve left my own ass hanging in the breeze. What I have a problem with is when I’m concealed somewhere behind an island and the radar cruiser is hiding behind an island yet I’m still detected. 

That’s not how radar works. Radar isn’t a mystical, magical thing. Solid shit blocks it. I mean, I can make an argument for hydro; it’s essentially just listening for engine racket underwater. I don’t think it should be precise around islands, but still warn you “hey dumbass, there’s another ship within X kilometers”."

space,feyjhg1,t1_fewm2lg,1579446309.0,"Time is “relative” in that the longer you exist, the more condensed it becomes. 

Think back to when you were 5. You’d be roughly experienced 2,628,000 minutes (2.628.000 for non-Americans). That was .00003805% of your life. 

Now, at 36 (middle of the road for a life average of 72 years), you’ve experienced 18,921,600 minutes. One minute is .00000528% of your life. 

So at 5, a minute is 3.805x10^-5. Halfway through a normal life, it’s 5.28x10^-6. An order of magnitude shorter. 

This, in my opinion, is a really good reason to not live forever; time would become a blur. The human brain doesn’t have the capacity to remember that much time.

*edit* Also, keep in mind time does actually change based on mass or, in the case of relativity, the speed you are going. Think of the movie Interstellar. They spent like 5 minutes on a planet orbiting a black hole; but to outside observers, it was years."

PFSENSE,fetx2nx,t1_fesqbp9,1579380941.0,"So basically you disabled Squid. 

If you want to keep Squid and allow this to work, it would be best to create an Alias of something like “Proxy_Bypass” and toss the IP in that alias. Then put the Alias into the “Bypass proxy for these destinations” on the general config page of Squid. 

You need Squid listening on the loopback to use it. If you don’t listen on the loopback, you’re basically not using it. pfSense basically intercepts port 80 on the inbound interface, then redirects to port 3128 on the loopback interface to proxy the connection.

*edit* FYI, there’s an option in Squid to allow streaming music, but I’ve found with certain audio (AAC being one) that just bypassing is the best option. I was banging my head on the floor trying to figure out why AAC streaming wouldn’t work when MP3 streaming from the exact same site worked. Long story short, MP3 is in Squid’s generic exclude list of things to cache; AAC isn’t."

WTF,feotwxz,t1_feobuj9,1579305433.0,"It could be a misspelling. 

[Methyl Ethanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol) is methanol, which is usually what they use to denature E-85 to keep the alcohol in it from being taxed under federal US law. It's the same reason you buy ""denatured alcohol"" in the hardware store. It's the same grain alcohol you'd drink except that it has to be non-consumable, so companies usually add methanol since it's part of the distillation process and evaporates before pure ethanol."
WTF,feotfuu,t1_feoaxlv,1579305167.0,"Correction. . .[it's 85% denatured ethanol](https://www.epa.gov/renewable-fuel-standard-program/e85-fuel). 

I don't know about other countries, but due to alcohol tax, you have to denature anything you don't want taxed as drinkable booze. 

Since this is Brazil, duder may be okay. I'm not sure what their laws are. In the US, he'd be dead because of [denaturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denatured_alcohol). Also, technically it is [methyl-ethanol (methanol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol). I'm assuming the dude/dudette you're replying to just misspelled methyl ethanol.
