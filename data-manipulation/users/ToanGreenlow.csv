slaythespire,ffln75l,t3_eu5acd,1580041718.0,"Act I:

Lagavullin takes top spot here. On Silent it's probably the worst fight in the game if you aren't equipped to handle it. The fight can go out of hand FAST regardless of character and fuck you up hard. Gremlin Nob is next, because even though Defect struggles HARD with this fight, the rest have a relatively easy time, provided they have gotten some heavy damage cards. Sentries are last, because they'll usually go down easily enough even with default decks.

Act II:

Gremlin Leader. BoS is a VERY close second. Gremlin Leader requires both heavy damage AND reliable AoE, something one or two AoE cards might not cover. BoS is a tough fight unless you can reliably weaken it every few turns. Taskmaster is easy IF you can quickly burst them down one by one.

Act III:

Reptomancer is hands down the worst Elite. You NEED insane amounts of AoE damage to safely keep the fight from killing you, something even amazing decks can fail at. Nemesis is second, mostly because of his 40ish damage he throws out every few turns. Thankfully that ""Block Check"" is easier to deal with then Reptomancers AoE Check. Giant Head is a Damage Check. On high Ascensions it's probably worse then Nemesis, but if you have a quick way to scale damage (Demon Form, Catalyst etc) the fight might not be that bad, especially if your deck can block effectively.

Trying to rank them all is abit tougher, but, from best to worst (regardless of character), i'd say it's:

Gremlin Nob

Sentries 

Taskmaster

Lagavullin

Gremlin Leader

Book Of Stabbing

Giant Head

Nemesis 

Reptomancer"
