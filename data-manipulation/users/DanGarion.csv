All proceeds for the event are going to Serving Our Veterans at Home. They are a local charity that works with veterans to get them to the benefits and services they already earned from being in the military.

We still have about 10 spots open for the event and some sponsorship opportunities as well. Let me know if you have any questions and I will be happy to answer them.

Right now we are estimating a donation of approximately $650!"
