I get there are others on this sub that have actually read the book

It’s about 400 pages in all IIRC, I’m mainly reading to read it right now but had an excuse to pick it up under needing something to use for rhetorical analysis. Bacon makes it pretty clear what kind of audience she is trying to go with for her book though so if you don’t like being told how diets don’t work or things like that I dunno how well you’ll sit through the earlier parts. Some of the studies mentioned I feel could be questionable but haven’t looked into them myself yet to say with certainty."

But at least it sounds like they're coming out of places of genuine worry/concern and not any sort of bad intent. You sound like you're in a decent position from what you've said here. Meal prepping is nice and it can help keep you on track while making sure you're getting a good healthy meal if you're gonna be pressed for time.

It's all about the journey and not treating it like a marathon. Better to lose slow and steady than a lot at once.  From an outsider's point of view if they've never done meal prep or counted calories they may not get how simple it can be once a routine has been set or if you get used to it.  Not sure what to recommend since I have some similar issues with the people I know but some have kinda gotten used to it and it's seen as something usual for me."

Gonna see what the weekend holds but I'm glad to finally be out of the 107-109 range after being stuck. I feel better to be honest but I still want to give myself a tad more time on my usual cut and see how the scale moves since I don't want to jump into maintenance too fast but also don't want to get any lower then where I was at Christmas Eve at 102.8

I've been noticing that my family has been getting on me more about that i'm getting too skinny and I'm watching my weight closely so I know how it's going but I just wanna be left to myself with it. Still stings when I got told I needed to start eating normally because I looked ""anorexic"" a few weeks back. when I had plateaued out (Literally just asked to use a can of lima beans because groceries were low and no one had been to the store in awhile and I wanted some fiber and extra protein for my day.)

Chipping away at Linda Bacon's Health At Every Size and it's funny to think that some of the stuff in the book about IE and making healthier food choices not because of the feelings associated with them and instead because of how they make you feel can get distorted when certain people get involved. I had just gotten to a section roughly 80 pages in where it talks about fat not being satiating as people think and honestly I agree, personally. I struggle to get even 30g a day sometimes but still try to get enough for hormone health.  I like fatty meats sometimes sure but don't like spending large amount of calories on them when I could get more vegetables.

All I really want to be happy is some steamed frozen brussel sprouts and apples, maybe a side of bread and butter pickles if I had to pick something in place of say a grocery store birthday cake."

I put your age and weight into TDEE calculator.net with a guessed height at 170 cm and even sedentary you’re maintenance calories is a little over 2400 a day so you should be losing weight if you’re actually consuming 1600 a day.

I have my fingers crossed that I'll have broke the post-holiday weight gain plateau by now since I managed to hit a new low of 107.4 yesterday on a weekday no less.

I've started reading Linda Bacon's Health At Every Size book (had to choose a book for a project I needed to do that was nonfiction and it had to be about some sort of topical issue..) and I'm about 50 pages in so far. Was pretty surprised to see there was a section where it would have you write in to see how ""intuitively"" you ate and even as someone counting calories I think I still managed to do well by the book's standards. I'm trying to read the book without any bias of any sorts but I really take issue with the idea of set points and diets failing, maybe because I'm someone who hasn't ""failed"" (you can't really fail at eating, even to lose weight as the option to get back on or change it up to work for you exists)

Outside of stress I've been dealing with the grief of losing my grandmother more lately and met with an on campus counselor to talk about it but got recommended to seek some outside help because it seemed like I would benefit better from it.

There's the saying that it's not what you do from Christmas to New Year's that makes you fat but what you do from New Year's to Christmas.

One of the family members I live with told me I needed to start eating normally and that I looked anorexic or else I was going to starve for real. I just asked to borrow a can of lima beans because everyone hadn't had a chance to get groceries so good food options were low. I had struggled to get enough calories because of the lack of options and had I not asked I would have been worse off calorie wise. It's been a struggle to hit 1200 this week as a result but should be able to fully swing into the usual 1200-1300 as I wait for the scale to come back down again.  I'm playing around with what I want my maintenance to be and the range I think some. I don't quite want to get back down to 102.8 but I just want to get to maybe the 103 - 106 as a happy range with 110 being the cut off for maintenance to have more allowance for fluctuations until I can hopefully get into lifting or something that builds muscle. I just can't tell if I actually gained over Christmas and I'm hoping I didn't but the scale just looks like 4-6 lbs hanging around now. (Feels like that would be a decent feat on 4 days of not counting even as a short person. Only gained .2 after 3 days for Thanksgiving so I was hoping for less then a 2 lb set back honestly.)

I really enjoy playing Just Dance 2020 because I feel like that releases endorphins that stepping with Wii Fit U doesn't. It sucks it makes it hard to have some podcasts going in the background though because I normally try to keep headphones in and noise to a minimum so I don't disturb anyone else. I don't know how accurate the calories burned in Sweat mode on the game is but it's interesting that some songs classed as low intensity burn more then the high intensity ones, especially if the low intensity ones are more leg movements then some of the harder songs that are focused on a lot of fast arm movements which I guess makes sense."

Despacito kicked me, can't remember if I did Sorry extreme at all (not big on Bieber). I will throw-down with Cotton Eye Joe and Rasputin.

Little rants at myself: I’m so annoyed and nervous about the post Christmas 4 day break from tracking calories weight that’s still hanging around. Went from 102.8 to 115.8 in 4 days but after getting back on track the 28th I’ve managed to get down into fluctuating between 107-109 the past few days but I’m getting impatient and hoping more comes off soon

I really didn’t think I would gain more then 2 pounds as a result of taking 4 days off since the 3 days I took off for New Year resulted in me gaining about .2lbs. Although I was on track for about 10 days before I figured that out.

I’ve been taking rest days from stepping the past few days due to sore ankles so I’ve been getting about 30 minutes to a little bit of an hour of Just Dance 2020 in a day and I’m not quite sure how they calculate calories burned but I hope it’s doing something. I’ve been on track for 7 days by now but my weight is between 107-109 but to try and calm down I told myself I shouldn’t worry about any weight hanging around until next weekend or the one after. It’s not fatlogic so long as I know I’m putting in the effort right? 

I’ve been slightly under 1200 to near 1200 exact the last few days so I know I’m not eating enough to gain. I’m a devout food scale user too. I thought I was used to weight fluctuations by now but I guess not.

I know I didn’t really have time to do much Christmas Eve and Christmas but I tried to exercise the most I could while I was on break. I know it’s hard to eat enough to gain a pound a day but my worries get the best of me.

I remember I didn’t track calories for 8 days after an accident my grandma passed in and pretty much ate whatever was around as lots of family were bringing around food and did go out to eat with family while not really getting a lot of exercise and I know I went up 5 actual lbs then. Because I spent the next two months trying to lose them afterwards. This was in June and I was 111-113 then. 

It sucks having a low TDEE but I’m hoping that worst case scenario by the time January ends I’ll be back close to where I was and start maintenance since I didn’t want to start before my birthday and Christmas. My weight loss has slowed to be about .6-.8 lbs a week though so I’m hoping it won’t take too long"
