worldnews,ff1dmzd,t1_ff1b474,1579477830.0,"Mammals, but members of Monotremata. As such, they retained several likely ancestral qualities of the earliest mammals, including egg laying and a lack of nipples (mammary glands likely evolved from sweat glands, and nipples came later). This is not because they are more ""primitive"" or archaic, but they branched off from other mammal lineages a very, very long time ago. Evidently there was no evolutionary pressure to remove or retool these aspects of their biology, but it's telling that the *only* place they still exist(ed?) is in Australia. 

There were likely a bunch of weirdo inbetweener mammals like this in the distant past, but only the monotremes remain. Check out the [Enantiornithes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiornithes) if you really want to blow your mind about how long different lineages of familiar animals can last."

worldnews,ferve49,t1_ferbrcu,1579358715.0,"Brilliantly stated. I was poor for almost the entirety of my thirty years on this planet. I'm missing a tooth and have to have another one replaced. I ate (and still to a degree eat) like crap because high energy, low cost garbage keeps you from ugly crying into your hands because you're so damn hungry that night. I have never owned a car or seen the vast majority of the United States. My college education was heavily leveraged on debt. 

It is stressful to be poor, partially because even minor costs end up being major chunks of your income and ability to function. Would you believe I still stress the f out over purchases over $30? People often berate the poor for making poor choices. What they don't realize is that when you're poor, better quality options are often simply out of your grasp, and even when you do make the ""right"" choice, the cost of failure is proportionally much, much higher than someone who can shell out $10,000 easy.

It makes you really, really sick, particularly because poverty is treated as a moral failing instead of the inevitable result of economic and societal systems that thrive on, if not outright require, a level of disparity between people. The system *needs* people to be poor; if it didn't, then nobody would work the horrible jobs that keep goods' prices artificially low and make huge profit margins for people at the top."

offmychest,fdeyr5q,t1_fdehr8z,1578349460.0,"I think one of the things that makes prayer so frustrating in the face of this catastrophe is the fact that the god that  most people are praying to (and I assume you, too), presumably Jesus, didn't just pray and leave it at that: he DID things.

When people were hungry and thirsty, he didn't just say ""pray to god and all will be handled."" He made loaves of bread and turned water to wine.

When his friend Lazarus died, he didn't just say ""ehh, my father will handle it."" He went over to his friend (and let's be honest, the fact that god has close friends is a little weird) and actually raised him from the dead.

When the lepers and the prostitutes and the thieves of the world needed succor, he didn't just tell them to pray and walk off--he did what he could to better their lives.

To pray without action is to say you follow Jesus without actually following what he *did.* To follow in the way of Christ is not simply to rely upon him; do as he did to heal a sick world. You may not be able to make miracles, but prayer should be your last resort, not your first. The thing you do when your back's against the wall and you gave the fight all you could, so you let go and let God do the rest. Sorry if you're not Christian, but this stuff always kind of gets under my skin with you ""thoughts and prayers"" types."

AmItheAsshole,fcsszpn,t1_fcssk1v,1577924343.0,"I also got to see a sheep slaughter up close and personal at a farm whose name eludes me at the moment. It was a short, intimate affair with the farmer first gathering the animal while soothing and trying to calm it.....then quickly drawing a blade against the throat and holding the head back while the animal bled out and lost consciousness. We then saw him hang up the beast to let the rest of the blood out (meat with blood spoils fast) and consumed it later that evening. Everyone had some besides for me. 

&#x200B;

For a long time I just couldn't eat meat. The stark, ugly finality of it, whether it was by overworked factory hands who had long since disassociated from the task, or a farmer who knew his animals by name, was just insurmountable for me. I think I found the latter worse because that animal grows up trusting you, then you're the one slicing its throat. It's freaky shit, man.

Well, if you guys insist, I'm leaving. Buh bye.

There's other places in the world that are getting it right. Just because the United States is big doesn't justify shit public transportation and an utterly callous disregard to smaller scale living. A city is not the whole US. Why should local infrastructure also be stretched out and overly oriented towards cars? I get people who actually like living out in the country will need a car and all, but I don't want that kind of life.

I live a few miles from work, entertainment and the grocery stores, and honestly I love it. I save so much money not having to have a car to get around, plus I've probably got the strongest legs in the office!  Cars are great and are an essential part of modern society, don't get me wrong, but I don't understand why people are so rigidly inflexible towards the notion of making room for anything else.

Don't you like the idea of safe streets? Don't you like the idea that your kids can safely bike or walk to school before they can purchase their own cars/if they're in the shop and can't get a ride in? Isn't it nice to be able to actually *walk* to a grocery store, grab what you need and be back in the time it takes to warm up the engine?

I'm actually very interested in European living now for the reasons you mentioned; they just seem to have a better grip on the things that I value.

bikecommuting,fcmsji5,t1_fcmcnh3,1577790146.0,"When people have their deep beliefs challenged, the psychological response is similar to a literal physical attack. A strange (and IMO unhealthy/dangerous) perspective in the US is that owning a car and driving every day is an essential rite of adulthood, instead of just a useful skill. You *have* to have a car or learn to drive as a teenager. Otherwise you're just a quasi-adult manchild.

 People who are not as introspective/aware of flaws in their logic will often ""retaliate"" as if people choosing a different path from them are somehow saying ""pfft, your way of life isn't good enough for *me.""*

Long story short, people are not nearly as rational or smart as we let on. Skills like knowing yourself have to be taught to many people, or else they often act reflexively. Nothing shows that better than challenging the hegemony of the automobile."
