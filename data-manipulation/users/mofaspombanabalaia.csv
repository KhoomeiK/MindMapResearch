> This is a list of short fiction by Stephen King (b. 1947). This includes short stories, novelettes, and novellas, as well as poems. It is arranged chronologically by first publication. Major revisions of previously published pieces are also noted. Stephen King is sometimes erroneously credited with ""nearly 400 short stories"" (or a similarly large number).[1] However, all the known published pieces of short fiction are tabulated below. In all, 208 works are listed.

> According to books by Tyson Blue (The Unseen King),[1] Stephen J. Spignesi (The Lost Work of Stephen King),[2] and Rocky Wood et al. (Stephen King: Uncollected, Unpublished), there are numerous unpublished works by Stephen King that have come to light throughout King's career. These allegedly include novels and short stories, most of which remain unfinished. Most are stored among Stephen King's papers in the special collections of the Raymond H. Fogler Library at the University of Maine, some of which are freely accessible to the library's visitors. However, others require King's permission to read. Additionally, there are a number of uncollected short stories, published throughout King's long career in various anthologies and periodicals, that have never been published in a King collection."

Those caught stealing glances at him were hung. One survivor recalled that von Braun, after inspecting a rocket component, charged, ""That is clear sabotage."" His unquestioned judgment resulted in eleven men being hanged on the spot. Says Gehrels, ""von Braun was directly involved in hangings.""

> Hangings were commonplace, and Dora inmates remember von Braun arriving in the morning with an unidentified woman, having to step between bodies of dead prisoners and under others still hanging from a crane. These were not ordinary hangings, Gehrels says, ""not hanging that breaks the neck of the prisoner, but they were slowly choked to death with a kind of baling wire around their neck.""

> In the early days at Dora, condemned men often shouted anti-Nazi slogans to the other prisoners, who were forced to watch the hangings. But the SS soon put an end to that. It became routine to silence the condemned by propping open their mouths with little sticks held in place by baling wire looped around their necks. In a postwar visit to the museum set up at Dora to document the horrors of the camp, Gehrels saw some of those sticks on display, as well as photographs of von Braun at Dora, lest anyone believe that he wasn't present to witness and help perpetrate the horrors.
