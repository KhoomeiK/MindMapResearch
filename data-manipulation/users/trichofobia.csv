Sinusitis,ff8dnpo,t1_ff8bafw,1579674139.0,"No worries. Keep in mind this was in Mexico in a very expensive hospital, a less expensive hospital would have cost around 3k US, but the doctor I wanted didn't work outside of that specific hospital.

I'm an allergy and chronic rhinosinusitis sufferer and wanted to ask what role food allergies along with aspirin sensitivity might play on sinusitis and polyp development? I'd also like to ask, how likely is it for a doctor to miss food allergies on skin prick tests?

I'm currently receiving inmunotherapy for what was found on my skin test, but I'm not sure if anything was missed."

A lot of people where I live in Mexico hunt, go hiking, travel and camp. The culture is a bit different from the US, because it's mostly higher class people and the appreciation and respect for nature is a bit less (meaning littering and some vandalism, but there's cases of this in the US too) since it's not really taught here."

Sinusitis,fek38jy,t3_ep96pk,1579191669.0,"First of all, I'm no doctor, so I might be way off the mark, but:

It might be something sinus related, but it strikes me as odd that both ears would go at once \*and\* you'd be fatigued and dizzy, but your face fullness feeling and pressure behind eyes and ears are definitely sinus simptoms.

If you're noticing a lot of fatigue it could be related to you not getting enough sleep (which will mess with your gainz bro) or it could be infections or allergies.

>Ever since I was 10 years old, I have to exert a lot of effort to  clear my Throat to get rid of excess mucus.

That in particular makes me think it might be allergies which might be causing sinus issues."
