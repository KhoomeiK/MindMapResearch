Four burgers (assuming the poster is talking about the $1.29 basic cheeseburger and not, say, a Quarter Pounder or a McDouble), plus a large Fanta (I assume large, since poster doesn't specify, but they seem like a large Fanta kind of person), plus a large chocolate shake is 2,340 calories. 

I mean, even before I started more carefully watching what I ate, I never ate that many calories in one sitting. I might have eaten that many in a day, but not in one meal. I mean, how do you even hold that much food at once? I'd be a bloated beach ball eating that much."

relationships,fefrjgf,t3_eouisp,1579063109.0,"This is easy: you handled this very badly.

Just step back, take a deep breath, and think about this: you’re (by my count) a month out from the incident in question. This all boils down to, “My cousin tried to do something nice for me and buy me upscale flavored water instead of plain water, and I got upset about it because it wasn’t a flavor I liked.” You go on about social norms. When given a gift, the social norm is to thank the person for the gift, even if it’s something as small as water, and even if it’s not exactly what you wanted. He was trying to do something \*nice\* for you. That’s not the time to nitpick or complain or react badly. Just say thank you and move on. It’s just water.

And yeah, to some extent, reading between the lines, it sounds like you got argumentative and/or showed a decided lack of social graces, which is probably why your cousin said, “You \*should\* feel bad.” It’s not in the social norm to behave that way when given a gift, and honestly, it kinda makes you look a little bratty. Just to be kind of blunt about it.

Honestly, overall, this is kind of a ridiculous thing to keep bringing up. You should have just let it go. He tried to do something nice for you, it didn’t work out the way you both hoped, some words were said that probably didn’t come out the way they were intended at the time, and that should have been the end of it. I’m not sure why you felt the need to keep bringing it up repeatedly over the following month. At that point, it kinda crosses into a realm where it gets a little, well, petty and obsessive. You’re upset a \*month\* later over a comment he made when he gave you a gift that you showed a decided lack of grace over. It’s no wonder he felt the conversation was “the stupidest conversation \[he’s\] ever had in \[his\] life.”

When it comes to friendships, there are a lot of times when friends say things that maybe don’t come out right. As a good friend, you don’t keep bringing it up over and over and over again over the span of a month. You are making it a way bigger deal than it is or ever should have been.

Just my analysis of what you described above? To be very blunt, because I can’t think of any other way to phrase this, you’re acting incredibly childishly. If you value your cousin’s friendship, just drop it. Some fights are worth fighting. I honestly don’t think this is one of them, because while you’re trying to ram your feelings down your cousin’s throat, you’re not listening, and I mean genuinely listening, at all to what \*he’s\* saying, and you’re trying to force him to rehash a month-old situation repeatedly when it’s something that, in the grand scheme of life, literally is not a big deal, and he probably can’t figure out why you’re making it a big deal. And on top of that, in your borderline self-righteousness over what boils down to being upset over your cousin \*buying you the wrong type of water\*, you’ve said some things to him that even you acknowledged were hurtful and that crossed the line. Is it \*really\* worth all this? I mean, really?

And just throwing this out there as an aside: Just because your cousin makes $110k a year doesn’t mean he has money. He could be secretly up to his eyeballs in debt for all you know. I’m not presuming he is. But I’m not presuming he isn’t, either. People in general don’t wave their financial situations around in other people’s faces, so you shouldn’t make assumptions about his financial status, because yearly salary doesn’t really mean a whole lot. And truthfully, I don’t see where what he makes per year is even relevant to the situation at hand—because divorcing all of that from the story, it basically boils down to you acting like a jerk over a \*bottle of water\*.

In sum: If you value your friendship with your cousin, just drop it. Be the bigger man. Offer up an apology for your words to him, and don’t demand one from him because that just makes the situation worse. He’ll apologize if he feels the need to, but if he doesn’t, just don’t worry about it, and don’t, for the love of God, escalate the situation even further. That will only make everything worse, and you could literally ruin a friendship over a disagreement over \*a bottle of water\*."

antiMLM,fdttqvw,t1_fdttg15,1578722062.0,"I’m not sure if it’s the sugar or what. I know the artificial sweeteners in the diet drinks don’t seem to help, though I can’t tell if it’s just them not helping or making it worse. Also the regular Coke has more caffeine in it than the others, which is probably part of it too. Maybe it’s a mix of the sugar and the caffeine? I just know after a lot of trial and error, that seems to be a combo that works really well for me and for my sister and mom when they get migraines too."
antiMLM,fdtpgke,t1_fdthv35,1578720174.0,"Excedrin definitely has caffeine in it. It helps open the constricted blood vessels that are partly responsible for the migraine in the first place.

OP: I get migraines on the regular. My trick is to take a dose of Excedrin Migraine and stack it with at least 12oz of a regular Coke (not diet or zero, classic). The combo of caffeine along with the painkiller in the Excedrin seems to do the trick, and the extra caffeine in the Coke helps it kick out faster."

Oh goodness, this. I was out shopping recently (right before Christmas) in a HomeGoods, and a customer had an ESA dog in the store with her. Service dog vest and everything. The dog was barking and pulling on the leash and lunging at people and knocking things off shelves and everything. I remember turning to my mom and going, ""That is NOT a service dog."" A real, properly trained service dog would be trained and would NEVER behave like that in the store.

&#x200B;

But seriously, to the OP: What your coworker is doing is technically time theft. He appears to be using it as an opportunity to avoid work and hide out in the bathroom doing God only knows what, and if he's spending an hour-plus at a time in the bathroom, that's an hour-plus he's getting paid for that he's not doing any work for. Which, obviously, costs the company you work for unnecessary money. The CEO really needs to put his foot down on that sort of thing, because it's affecting everyone else in the office, and not just from a need-to-use-the-restroom perspective."
AskReddit,fdhncfs,t1_fdhmkd2,1578426296.0,"It's not so much as what he's said (because I think inarguably everyone here could agree that he's a blowhard who says a lot of dumb crap), it's more what he's done. Like, when you take a step back and look objectively at the actual results of the things he's done, divorcing the fact it's Trump from the equation, he's actually done some pretty decent things. The economy is actually doing really well--and that's something that directly effects everyone's paychecks, I think--and unemployment is shockingly low. Most of the things the federal government does has zero impact on the average American's life (like, actual real, tangible impact), so I tend to look at the things that DO have an impact, and that tends to go to things like the economy and healthcare and regulations etc. There's a lot of stuff I don't like that he's done, but at the same time, it's that sort of stuff that literally doesn't impact the average American's life at all.

Very broad statement here, I know. I'm at work sneaking on Reddit, so I don't want to take too much time to ramble, but basically, it's a lesser of two evils type thing, and while I hate that politics in America has degenerated to the point that we're having to choose between ""evils,"" I do try to live in reality, and the reality seems to be (for me) that a lot of the stuff that matters to me, that I think is important, I've seen actual improvement on under Trump. There are still things I'd like to see improvements on (i.e. prescription drug prices, overall healthcare costs, which went to hell in a handbasket after the government got involved, etc.), but from what he HAS done that I actually care about, I've been rather pleased with. (And, for the record, I couldn't give two shits about his whole ""let's build a wall!"" rhetoric and other similar bloviations because I knew, intellectually, that sort of stuff was never going to happen.)

My main problem with the Democrats right now is that a lot of their promises and ideas are legitimate pie-in-the-sky, literally impossible to achieve in the current climate ideas. They either cost way too much money that we just don't have (and mathematically wouldn't be able to ever get without bankrupting the entire freakin' country), or they're just not feasible because they keep going for a one-size-fits-all approach when a lot of the issues *aren't* one size fits all.
