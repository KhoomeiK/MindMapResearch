NYGiants,fg725e0,t1_fg70mey,1580582230.0,"To your point. The small difference in talent with players should also carry over to coaching. Whats the difference between a great coach and a bad one? 
It really falls on the shoulders of the GM to assemble the right group of people around each other. The coaches, scheme, trainers and players all have to be on the same page.
I look at the Giants and smh because they were given the same chances as the Raiders. Arguably the Giants had more talent in a softer division. The difference was the GM/Coach relationship. Player/Coach relationship"

A. They flip and get rid of him but their moral high ground is already gone.

B. Go down with the ship and have everything exposed after the fact further diminishing any credibility in the future.
