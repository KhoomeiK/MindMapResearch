liberalgunowners,ffeux3o,t1_ffers5s,1579866616.0,Thank you. This is usually my go to argument and almost without fail people will wax poetic about their support for one and shit on anyone who supports the other. Like damn can't I just support all rights instead of cherry picking
liberalgunowners,ffeuqzg,t1_ffepr15,1579866411.0,Sign me up lol
europe,ffes2bb,t1_ffejhlw,1579862784.0,Except the Basque of course. The Roman's left those vicious bastards alone
nfl,fferkob,t1_ffdy5sa,1579862053.0,Its been 9 years since he signed with the Broncos. He still lives in Denver with his family and has literally been quoted saying he considers this home now. Plus he stops by the Broncos facility every season for spring training. When was the last time he swung by the colts facility?
WTF,ffakddv,t1_ffa6r0k,1579737905.0,Not anymore they don't. Example A: Afghanistan

atheism,ff5qpo5,t1_ff4qh1f,1579606414.0,They say reproduction but what they mean is WASP reproduction. Already too many of those other people in their eyes
chess,ff4wqr5,t1_ff4qf2x,1579574289.0,Appreciate it
chess,ff4nub2,t1_ff4nb5j,1579568148.0,OMG. ok thank you. I feel a little stupid now for even asking. I thought for sure it was something complicated like the 50 move rule or something else that was going over my head since I'm still a somewhat new player. I didn't even take something that simple into consideration.
snowboarding,ff4e3y5,t3_ergjly,1579561439.0,Super smooth
AskAnAmerican,ff27v8y,t1_fezz6e1,1579496346.0,Colorado sucks. Tell your friend. -a Coloradan
worldnews,ff0shul,t1_ff0p8qr,1579471879.0,This is the real reason he has the support of Republican politicians. Unlike most Republican voters who worship Trump despite on average being more than a few french fries short of a happy meal. Republican politicians loath Trump behind closed doors but will support him until hell freezes over since they know he can be used as a means to an end. He has no policies or ideas of his own. He just supports whatever he hears on FOX NEWS even if its completely nonsensical. Much like his base.
DenverBroncos,ff01udd,t1_fezxnng,1579464313.0,A true martyr lol

movies,feow2yr,t1_fenpeyi,1579306657.0,Yeah but people are dumb. All they're gonna see is the word FOX which does have a very negative connotation in some parts of the country.

solotravel,fem97c0,t1_fekkxg9,1579244418.0,Bastards got me in Florence as well... and Budapest but that was a calculated gamble that I lost lol

solotravel,fem8y7s,t1_felwy4z,1579244128.0,I'd be willing to bet most people. At least most people under 50

harrypotter,fekzsc4,t3_epnfvv,1579211012.0,I've done approximately 15 read throughs of the entire series since I was a kid. So I don't know many you need but it must be more than that
solotravel,fekxyzg,t3_epkfky,1579209921.0,Screen shot the route to your hostel or hotel before you arrive in a new city. You never know what kind of cell or internet service you'll have once you get somewhere. Old cities with their tiny winding cobblestone alleys might be beautiful to experience. However they're pure hell when its getting dark and you're trying to find a hostel that occupies the 3rd-6th floor in a building with a laundromat on the ground floor and the only sign is a 4 inch sticker with an arrow placed on the corner of the building.
solotravel,fekx7dq,t1_fek87qx,1579209464.0,I've been to France a handful of times and if you're willing to eat like the French eat they are not rude at all. Italians on the other hand... especially if you're on public transport are the biggest bastards I've ever met
solotravel,fekwrhs,t1_fejxoi3,1579209203.0,Also when visiting Sintra the castle isn't the only attraction be sure to check out the amazing garden that wraps around the mountain. You can actually walk all the way up or down if you have the time (and you're in good shape) no need to ride the bus. And like you said don't skip the Moorish castle either
solotravel,fekweo6,t3_epkfky,1579208991.0,"A lot of restaurants in Europe will put little plates with olives, nuts, and bread on the table when you sit down but unlike in america they usually aren't complimentary. So ask before you dig in because in many places they're going to charge you extra if you touch that plate.


The best way to see Venice is on the water bus that makes a loop. It's even cooler at night. Sit in the very front! 


 The Tokyo rail system is color coded and the lines are literally painted on the floor. Don't try to read Japanese. Just follow your color. 


Also if you're going to a Greek island don't rent a car. Rent an ATV trust me."
