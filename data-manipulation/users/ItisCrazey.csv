cats,ffinyqe,t1_ffdykhi,1579978430.0,Well we still let them outside because they are likely to tell us (at least the mother). Her daughter is pretty much an inside kitty but she likes to go in our garden sometimes aswell
cats,fdprb2e,t1_fdol0vp,1578637513.0,"Well we live in a very small village in which all cats are allowed outside. We got her basically from the street of out village and she was already 15 years old. She lived a few more years. Our current  Cat was half a year when we found her on the street. Pregnant. We gave 3/4 kittens another home and kept one. Both are going outside.


Everyone in our village knows whos cat is whos and whos dog us whos.


So if we would have kept her inside not letting her out we would have made them depressed. They stay inside at night and in winter they are home most of the time anyway.


So we would have negligted their wellbeing more then if we would keep them in and never let them out.

Hope that changes your view.


Ps: Our two are coming home both for about 5 and 6 years now."

""You are really tolerant for a German""

TrueOffMyChest,fd49hg0,t1_fd42ywe,1578165588.0,"That is something I do with my friends often
We pay for meals as a thx or because one of us is short (again lol) 


Or we buy each other sweets or for the class like cookies, chocolate, chips and stuff.


Everyone just brings stuff along and those who don't, don't get any treats XD"
TrueOffMyChest,fd3d6xi,t3_eju6l1,1578157119.0,"Let's burn those kind of females down and pay for it like ""Men"" * cough cough *
(Don't get me wrong I am female too but this kind is frickin annoying delt with one or two myself already) 

I dislike them so much.. Like bruh either we split the bill so we each pay for our own food or we aint going nowhere. 


I just imagine them getting like 10 meals one more expensive then the other and you sittin there with 25 bucks and the kids menu you ordered (cuz you like that the nuggets are dino shaped :P)"
AmItheAsshole,fcsufnb,t3_ds3cl6,1577925387.0,"Update: Okay I know why I couldn't be happy for him now. I was always a person who could ""feel"" fishy situation. Who would have thought. She used him to make someone else jealous. I am suoer mad at her because he really doesn't deserve it. He told me the entire month they were together she only told him once ""I love you"" and then got on and on complaining about him.


Well I am trying to comfort him but it is kinda hard because I feel like a replacement...
Back when he was with her he tried to have more and more contact with her and I understood."
TrueOffMyChest,fcq8g5r,t1_fcq5una,1577880939.0,"Yeah maybe

spacefrogs,fcn5ek3,t3_ehiiam,1577803731.0,Naja wenn man Rick heiﬂt isses auch nicht schwer nh
AmItheAsshole,fcn4vq8,t3_ehw713,1577803333.0,"NTA duh... She should not be upset more lik proud or something. Not all dads are like this I think we heat that often enough. But imagine being jealous of your child. Sounds kinda like cinderella all over again 

But let me tell you something I heard so often: ""A good man loves three women. His Mom, his Wife and his daughter"""
TrueOffMyChest,fc2oqsq,t3_ef8w4a,1577369402.0,The reminder was set quite perfectly. I wish sou good luck man
