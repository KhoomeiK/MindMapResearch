snackexchange,fcjo9qg,t1_fcic958,1577696336.0,His birthday is January but I'm sure he'd very pleased with a late birthday present. Or maybe a Valentines Day treat! I've never done a snack exchange before (I usually do reddit gifts!). But I've already been to the post office to ask about sending parcels to Japan so I'm confident I know how to do it üòä
rarepuppers,fchtulx,t3_eh5ivw,1577654066.0,He is absolutely stunning! Very unusual looking

snackexchange,fcaex73,t3_eeuq0m,1577568057.0,Hello! A quick question for you - might you be interested in trading for UK snacks? It's my partner's birthday coming up and he loves all things Japan so I would love some Japanese food/drinks/unusual items for him! üòä

pics,fc9b7sk,t1_fc99842,1577549979.0,"So, I talked to my dad about it just now. The lady that was walking her dog wasn't able to swim out but my dad plodges out all the time to check his lobster pots and whatnot. The lady then asked her (photographer) son to come down and take a candid photo of dad and Luna (which she then revealed by posting it through his fishing shed later). He says he thought it was odd that the fella kept pointing his camera at him but he thought that the man liked the look of Luna üòÇ Dad thinks Luna is the most beautiful dog that ever lived and assumes everyone else does too (I sure do). He is a lovely man who goes out of his way to help people, a total hero and I'll pass the message on!"
pics,fc8yxdq,t1_fc8yke9,1577544337.0,"I had to take a photo of the photo posted through dad's fishing shed door, (photoception!). As soon as the festive season is over I'll have more time to work out this phone and edit photos before posting."

funny,fc0vw1h,t3_efgutm,1577301049.0,It's the loveliness of knowing someone paid attention to you that really gets to you at Christmas. My siblings and I bought my mam a sewing machine this Christmas and she burst into tears. Great big heaving sobs that actually panicked me. She didn't think anyone had listened to her lamenting over her sewing machine breaking down and was over the moon when she realised we all heard and worked together to save for her present.

todayilearned,fbzqx9e,t3_ef823i,1577257026.0,I suggested this to my family this year but they laughed at me - they're not big readers. I wonder if an Icelandic family would mind adopting me for one Christmas Eve!
