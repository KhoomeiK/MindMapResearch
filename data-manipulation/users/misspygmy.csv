There’s a lot at play here and OP and her husband are both TA, him for making his wife (rightfully) uncomfortable about his relationship with M, and her for being (it seems) passive aggressive and absolutely for refusing therapy and being unreasonable about that request to the point of sleeping at her sister’s. 

M is also TA because she should know better than to cozy up to her neighbor’s husband,  especially when the wife is acting cold towards her, but hopefully she’ll learn that with life experience."

relationship_advice,ffav2vr,t3_esm74p,1579745173.0,"Well, it doesn’t sound like you’ll be able to forget this because based on everything you said, it is very likely happen to again. 

Here’s the thing you need to remember no matter what: you didn’t do anything at all that would justify him in accusing you of cheating. You were having a very normal day. Therefor, this is very definitely a problem with him and his way of thinking, and not with you or your behavior. 

People are going to tell you this could be a big red flag for an abusive relationship waiting to happen, and they’re right. It is. Or, maybe, he’s been burned really badly in the past and doesn’t know how to get past it and how to behave with his current partner. 

If he’s going to continue to be unable to trust you when you’re doing completely normal things, he needs therapy to help him get over his past traumas, and to learn how to be in a healthy relationship. If it gets worse and he becomes controlling and stops you from doing things you would normally do, or seeing your friends and family, you should get out this relationship, regardless of WHY he says he’s like that. Why doesn’t really matter at that stage. 

Good luck, OP! You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders."
relationship_advice,ffark6z,t3_esllf2,1579742831.0,"She’s worried that you aren’t happy, and aren’t attracted to her. 

This is probably because she’s insecure, or because she’s not getting clear cues from you that you ARE happy and attracted to her, or both. 

Is she a touchy feely cuddly person who likes hugs? Hug her more. Does she respond well to compliments? Tell her she look nice today and that you have a great time hanging out with her. Does she like gifts and flowers and things like that? Get her a little something that lets her know you’re thinking of her.

Someone else mentioned the five love languages, which is a good thing to look up. It basically tells you what a person needs their partner to do to make them feel happy and secure. Look it up, do your best to figure out what makes her feel happy and secure (also ask her!), and do those things. 

People are different and need different things from their partners to feel happy. You might have to figure it out together. Good luck!"

AmItheAsshole,ff93wtr,t3_escrk8,1579704235.0,"NTA at all. Having some time apart from your partner is both important and healthy. You both have to be functioning people outside of your relationship or it’s definitely going to cause problems. 

Also, your social life at work is really important. Having connections with your co-workers and being a part of the social fabric there is necessary if you want to be viewed in a positive light and seen as a team player. 

Maybe tell her that you love that she wants to spend time with you, but that even your social life at work is still a part of your job to some extent. She should really be viewing her job the same way and making personal connections with people there too. 

What if you agreed to have lunch together once a week and viewed it has a date? Maybe go somewhere nice or different or take a walk together/have a picnic? That way you get your time to yourself back and give her something special as well? But yeah, definitely NTA."
NoStupidQuestions,ff8dvw9,t3_es7xc7,1579674392.0,"I think I might see what you’re saying? Honestly though you need to find a different way of asking this question, this is massively confusing.

So, I’m imagining a conversation like this (I could be wrong, I’m still confused by the question), it would go like this:

Person: Tyler played a great game of football last night!

You: Um, I’ve known Tyler for five years and Tyler doesn’t play football.

Person: He doesn’t??

You: (the correct answer, to say that Tyler does NOT play football, should be) No, he doesn’t.

So, if I’m getting this right, if someone asks “He doesn’t?” and you want to say that he does NOT do/think/feel that thing, is “No.” 

Or, to be more clear, “No, he doesn’t.”

Was that completely wrong or is that what you’re asking?

EDIT: If that is what you’re asking, I actually do really see why this is confusing."

BUT it is deeply unkind and also (more importantly) extremely unhealthy to turn a disagreement with a partner physical, which you did, even if the coffee wasn’t hot. I hate being told to calm down, but if someone was so upset they were about to make it physical, I might do the same."

NoStupidQuestions,ff8cm5k,t3_es7htf,1579673021.0,"Well, there’s also “Late afternoon/early evening,” which is a term I use often when setting up meetings with people. That’s runs from about 4 PM to 6:30 PM. 

For me, I’d say evening starts when the majority of people might begin to eat their evening meals (so, excluding outliers), even if I don’t eat mine at that time. So like...5:30 PM is the start of evening for me.

I’d never thought about that before."
relationship_advice,ff8c98i,t3_es7ii7,1579672649.0,"You are not crazy, you are 100% right to be concerned. 

That said, she’s not going to want to listen to you, and Tyler will likely try and keep her away from you, if he’s that manipulative. I’m SO not an expert, but I wonder if this might be a good strategy: remain a supportive friend to her (which doesn’t mean you have to pretend to like her boyfriend, I don’t think), but also encourage her to seek therapy to deal with the assault. Any halfway decent therapist will see some major red flags in this relationship, and will be trained in talking to people about issues like this.

Edit: and, if she was assaulted, she should really be seeing a therapist regardless of Tyler."

I know it can be awkward trying to talk AND keep things sexy, but if you’re just starting out, now is a good time to get comfortable communicating and establish a precedent. 

It can be awkward when someone asks you “What do you want me to do?” so just do something and while you’re doing it, say something easy to answer like, “Is that good right there?” or “Harder or softer?” or even “You can just put my hands where you want them...”

You can also open up the conversation by talking about it afterwards (not loudly in Starbucks), but maybe later in the day. Give her a hug and a sexy kiss and say “Thanks for earlier, it was amazing and I loved doing XYZ to you - Was that good? Let me know if there’s something I can do to make it better for you.” And give her another sexy kiss then leave it that, unless she wants to talk about it right then. She might take a while before she wants to open up (or maybe not) but that way she’ll know she can.

In terms of making her orgasm, every person is completely different, and there’s nothing worse than being with a partner who seems like they’re following some guidebook but not paying attention to you. You can read all sorts of tips and tricks about that stuff but they will never apply to all or even most women. Learn to communicate - honestly that’s what makes sex sexy."
AmItheAsshole,ff89a7r,t3_es754q,1579669776.0,"I see why this is awkward and confusing, since it sounds like there aren’t really clear rules or boundaries in this situation, but I think YTA a little bit because people are entitled to some control over their living spaces unless you all have some explicit agreement (which it doesn’t sound like there is). 

What if he was just about to jump in the shower because he had to go out in a few minutes or something, and there was someone who didn’t even live there in his bathroom? I’d be annoyed too. And everyone deserves some say as to who occupies their living space, no matter how briefly, for a multitude of reasons. Maybe he just thought it was rude that you didn’t bother to ask. 

I also recognize that you meant no harm and it’s somewhat unclear in this scenario what’s acceptable and what’s not. Apologize and ask ask him if it’s ok if you use it occasionally, provided you knock and ask first?"
