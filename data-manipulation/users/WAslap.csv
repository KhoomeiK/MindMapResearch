Tattoo removal is simply the process of firing a lazer at the pigment to break it into smaller pieces. Once small enough, the body can remove the pigment particulates. Otherwise they stay. Sunlight damages tattoos the same way but with less energy and less quick."

As far as I have seen all the Parisian snob bullshit has been nothing but lies to me. YMMV. They also tried to speak English and the French in the bar and the bartender and my group all spent the night laughing and trying to understand each other.
