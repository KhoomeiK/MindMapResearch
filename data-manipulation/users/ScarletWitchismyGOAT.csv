HumansBeingBros,ffqh3cc,t1_ffpgj80,1580134406.0,"You’re conflating the two issues. Men have statistically higher risk jobs and also tend to make more high-risk decisions. In turn, these factors subject them to higher rates of injury or violence.  Men generally have greater likelihood of displaying aggression (including sexual), violent behaviors, risk-taking, territoriality, etc. making them one of the main sources of danger to women. Women are at risk at almost all times, regardless of their choices, just by virtue of being female. 

You are also making an offensive attack on a stranger’s intent and you seem to believe they owe a debt of gratitude to men who don’t hurt them or the ones paid to protect people.. You make it seem as if men don’t also benefit from the things you cite. Men who are not the ‘protectors’ have plenty to gain from the roles filled by soldiers, bouncers, security, guards, and cops (all jobs, by the why, which also employ females, albeit less so). So try again, because if you untangle the two ideas you’ve presented, the point you are trying to make may still be salvageable."

AmItheAsshole,fdyyavu,t1_fdyde2u,1578784769.0,"My only point is that the removal of choice will color how she looks back on the experience. Because she may not learn the intended lesson and instead blame the victim for having missed it, she may end up indeed having a memory of an event that would otherwise be completely forgettable.

Edit: Submitted accidentally without finishing. She obviously needs a punishment and the type of social punishment prescribed absolutely fits the social crime in this case. I just really think because ""prom"" is included, the intended effect is going to backfire unless she truly feels remorse, which she clearly doesn't. More than likely she's just gonna blame that poor girl for making her miss such a magical, once-in-a-lifetime, rite of passage (*eyeroll because most proms are lame in hindsight to most people*)"

Many people are this way through no fault of their own, yet others remain rigid through willful ignorance. It is disturbing to know how deeply the lack of education, the misunderstanding of teachings, and especially the *rejection* of basic philosophical concepts runs through the human population at large.

Critical thinking, analysis, dialogue, logic, epistemology, etc.; the invaluable tools that humanity has identified, named, studied, evolved, applied, and adapted throughout our existence on this planet to help us to navigate the absurdly complicated webs of human morality, ethics, and our own nature and elevated us over centuries, is continuously circumvented or completed avoided by so many, even in this era, to the peril of the whole.

It’s how we arrive at an equivalency fallacy like this comment. In turn, it prevents even civil discourse about the topic at hand, and, for me personally, makes it hard not to be fatalistic about the destiny of our species, as though we have reached our intellectual limits as humans. *huff*"
