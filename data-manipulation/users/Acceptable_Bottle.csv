AmItheAsshole,ffbndwt,t3_esp9yw,1579774080.0,"YTA this sounds like something Dwight Schrute would say in the office. It wasn't really an issue that ever needed to be addressed, because despite what you think everyone thinks, EVERYONE prefers to keep masturbation and sex private, and no one would EVER just masturbate in front of their coworker."

You would be an asshole if you end an entire 
friendship over being left on read. Perhaps your friend forgot, maybe she was too busy, maybe she's still planning to call you later. A message left on read has to be taken with a grain of salt because it could mean any number of things.

The tone of this post is a little concerning. Have you always believed yourself to be ""the better friend"" of the two of you? There's almost nothing in the post that says something positive about your friend. Does this really reflect reality?

Of course, I'm just speculating at this point. Either way, it feels like you need to wait a little for her to come around. You're not the asshole yet!"
AmItheAsshole,ffblxtw,t1_ffb4him,1579771850.0,"""can't be an asshole for just saying the truth""

This is not always true and should therefore not be used to make a case for yourself ever. For example, if you tell a mentally disabled person ""you're not very smart"" your still an asshole, despite telling the truth."

Yeah, you're not really obligated to watch your language by law, but really how hard is it to watch your language just for a while? He asked politely, as you put it, and it's not really asking very much from you. The least you could do is just follow his request for a while. It's just some curse words, you don't need them. Next time just help a fellow human out.

Also I can understand a N A H judgement, but anyone who says that the dad is an AH should probably reconsider. He asked politely and didn't act entitled at all."
AmItheAsshole,fevsgev,t3_eqlbl1,1579400902.0,"NTA your MIL sounds like she has earned forgiveness through lots of apology and remorse. Your husband, on the other hand, seems to be irritated over something that he himself caused. If he hadn't pressed the issue at that time, he would've gotten to stay in the room. There isn't much you could've done to keep him in the room after that. You definitely need to talk it out with him, because letting it pass over won't fix the issue. 

Additionally, what does ""act coldly"" mean exactly? It really doesn't feel like anyone would be angry about this after 3 whole weeks. He should probably be more overjoyed with the fact that the baby has arrived and be more busy bonding with it and stuff.

It really sounds like you both love each other a lot, given how great he acted during the pregnancy and how appreciative you are of him. Honestly, you shouldn't worry too much. He'll probably get over it.
