depression,ffkh3qj,t3_etzlpc,1580022662.0,"That's me right now. 2 months ago I had a job, was going to gym, and was trying at life. Now I just sit at home all day, and I dont even go to my doctor appointments no more. There is no point. I am broken. This world ain't fair and just. Efforts don't have to pay off. Suffering don't have to have any meaning. I'm trying to say I am fundamentally broken, and I need to hurry up, gather the courage and fking jump off that bridge already."
depression,ffbhfn3,t1_ffb8vur,1579765446.0,"For the problems that money truly can't solve. Epstein supposely killed himself cuz he was gonna age and die in prison, but we all know theres more to it. Robin Williams (rip) killed himself cuz he was suffering from some bad illness. 

Money won't solve everything, but it offer people opportunities. They can buy good education. Good healthcare. Good personal health trainers and caretakers. Good home. Good neighborhood. With enough money, you can even buy citizenships. Money can buy you time to do the things you actually want to do. With even more money, you can set the rules and influence governments. 

Money can't buy everything, but the more money you have, the more you can buy."
depression,ffbgqc2,t1_ffajqh6,1579764546.0,"Same, I would honestly say being rich will definitely save me. I can finally see some good doctors, get personal help from private therapists, physical therapists, trainer, and all kinds of help to get me into a much more healthier state. Have a cook make me healthy meals everyday, so I dont skip meal and eat cheap garbage food everyday. I can go and do charities which I dream of and just live whichever way i want. 

Who ever says money can't solve anything is either naive, or have an agenda. Give me at least 5 million dollars, and I'll show you how it can turn me around fast."
ForeverAlone,felrn5q,t1_fekcr24,1579229249.0,That's actually a really good way of looking at it. People with disabilities still live great lives and do amazing things... however social connection is so important for humans tho
ForeverAlone,feiyj1q,t3_ep8ru6,1579150806.0,"23 here too, 3 weeks until 24. Same as you, except I never tried dating apps. I admire your courage man. Dating apps would destroy me, and kill the last slimmer of hope left in me that's keeping me alive."

undiagnosed,fdig5bi,t1_fdhgcnk,1578442149.0,"""It’s so hard to be a young person and watch life pass you by when no one is able to help you."" Exactly. I had to learn to make peace with the passage of time, but it wasnt easy.

Did you get your hormones checked? I mean like the actual numbers, and not just take the word from doctors who say you're okay. My testosterone levels were in the 200s when I was your age, and my doctor at the time ignored it. I wasnt knowledgeable about hormones back then, but now looking back 200 was extremely low for an late teenager.  That could very well be a big contributor to the fatigue, the joint pains, and in my case the poor sleep, no existent libido, poor immunity, being underweight, poor development, and brain fog.

At this point, I do accept that psychology has a big part to play in one's poor health. However, treating it exclusively as a mental problem isn't going to solve anything. I've done that and my symptoms never really improved. Sure my anxiety decreased, and my sleeps were better while medicated under anti depressants, but it also gave me new problems. 

Where do you live? Are you able to get better quality health care?"
undiagnosed,fdgdbq7,t3_eifdor,1578391320.0,"I am 23 years old and have suffered all the symptoms you described and more. My problems started around age 16, and has destroyed my life. I was literally bed ridden for 2 years straight. Was so depressed and anxious on top of it that I think I developed ptsd from those years. Then i manage to learn how to cope a bit better, and I started seeing doctors about my symptoms and tried antidepressants and therapies. Well nothing has worked, and my health deteriorated over the years.

What I want to say to you is to never give up trying. I tried the ""it's all in your head"" part many times throughout the years, and I have tried anti depressants and treated it like a mental illness, but ultimately nothing helped my physical symptoms. And I know for a fact that my problems are more physical than mental, or at least my symptoms are. 

Dont give up and dont get discouraged by arrogant doctors. Find a new doctor and try again. Autoimmune, hormones, and psychology can all play a part in these symptoms."
Ebay,fdg467i,t1_fdg1i2b,1578379335.0,Did you call them and ask to resolve it in anyway? Like paying back the balance instead of earning it back 1% at a time...
Ebay,fdfy5s0,t1_fdf2o2w,1578373498.0,"Dam that sux, I sell things too and completely understand this whole mess. I paid for the return shipping, and don't want to cheat on the Ebay buck system. Wish they would just change that ebay buck balance in real time. Now I feel guilty and scared that ebay will make my ebay bucks negative."
