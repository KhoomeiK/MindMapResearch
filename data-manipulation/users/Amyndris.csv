For example, even your personal IP is PII, a lot of times, FB could track you over your home router's IP since that's not considered personal, but associated with your household (which is protected under CCPA but not GDPR)."
technology,ffcgs6b,t1_ffcf9wy,1579799130.0,"CCPA has strong regulations, but poor penalties.  I think its capped at 25k per offense which really isnt that bad.

GDPR is 4% of your annual revenue (not profits but total revenue) so it actually has teeth.  So a bajillion dollar company like Amazon or Disney actually need to worry about it. 

CCPA is good, but really needs more bite.  I do like how they treat IPs and devices as PII though, that's a step up from GDPR"

KOFALLSTAR,feepy3j,t1_feem9z5,1579038746.0,"I know that for Fire Emblem Heroes, purchased gems do not cross platforms (ie. if you have 150 gems, 100 paid/50 free on IOS and swap to Android, you'd only have the 50 free gems).  Basically, those gems are locked to the platform you bought it on, but free gems can be carried over.  

Not sure if that's applicable to KOFAS, but burning off paid gems first can help mitigate that."

KOFALLSTAR,fec001j,t1_febtlyh,1578964769.0,"The issue comes with when are you allowed to recognize the revenue.  Historically, the SEC states that you cannot recognize revenue until 4 conditions have been met:

* Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists.
* Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered.
* The seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable.
* Collectibility is reasonably assured.

3 of the 4 is locked down.  However, the it's questionable if ""Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered."" if they haven't traded the crystals in for a good/service.  When a user spends crystals on a loot box, it's fair to say that deliver has occured.  When a user spends crystal on stam refreshes, same thing.  However, if they just have crystals sitting there, it becomes a far blurrier line unless you want to argue that the crystals themselves are the delivery of goods/services.  At least from my perspective it's far easier to be conservative in your interpretation of SEC regulations than being super aggressive and hoping you don't get flagged by them for falsifying or filing misleading financial reports.  

Besides, this probably affects very little in terms of actual customer impact."

KOFALLSTAR,fe9kwxf,t1_fe8th0f,1578938818.0,"Logic is from the world of finance.  You generally want people to used up stored value ASAP because you have to hold that on your books as a liability until it's spent.  Meanwhile you don't have to hold free gems on the your books until they're spent because in theory, they have a value of $0 to your company.  

Otherwise, you'd be like ""We have $100M in revenue, but $80M in liabilities"" since people keep burning through their free gems instead of their paid gems."
