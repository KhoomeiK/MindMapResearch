opiates,fef1cgt,t3_eotm3m,1579045863.0,Oh yeah. It's pretty great. I'm a little envious.
meme,fdcw28j,t1_fdck3t6,1578285972.0,Don't forget the bath salts. The Iranians aren't going to eat off their own faces.
todayilearned,fcpmduo,t1_fcpclgw,1577867452.0,"Not if it jeopardizes the program as a whole. It's important to have the help available to all that need it. Eminem isn't going to do that tho. He can't sponsor everyone. AA needs to be there and be healthy in order to accomplish this. I don't agree with celebrities affiliating themselves to AA, but that doesn't mean they can't tell the public that they're sober and offer hope."
todayilearned,fcplnte,t1_fcpcl9g,1577867021.0,Well yeah... but they are there.
todayilearned,fcp4l1k,t1_fcoxuag,1577850278.0,"That's right. Back in the 30s they had far more demand than they could handle to mentor or sponsor others. Thus the reason the first 100 men wrote and published the Big Book. They had to make a living and didn't want to charge for the solution that had been freely given to them by others. The stigma was a small part of the necessity for anonymity, but for most alcoholics,  it wasn't really a secret that they were drunks. At least as sober alcoholics they were improving their lives. Now, it's a matter of protecting the reputation of AA."

todayilearned,fcp3vpd,t1_fcoubc3,1577849664.0,The problem is when someone who has a high profile fucks up it tends to reflect poorly on a program that has helped millions of people. That's the primary reason for anonymity anymore.
dontputyourdickinthat,fbx96aq,t1_fbw6tpw,1577175117.0,... fuck is wrong with people? Yeah. Idk.
