financialindependence,fff1atu,t3_et7g74,1579872948.0,"Here is probably a silly idea, that is only tangentially FIRE related. Older people are at a much higher risk of dying from a infectious disease than young people. Does it make sense to get sick on purpose in your 20's so you have a stronger immune system for your old age? Like saving in your 20's for your immune system's retirement account."
GoldandBlack,ffdalx8,t1_ffcd717,1579816729.0,This book is great and should be better known reading. It's like the HHH book but much better and has the advantage that it's within (and thus accepted by) mainstream academics.
financialindependence,ffd8my7,t1_ffc05zy,1579815566.0,Twitter is a cesspit.

GoldandBlack,ffc9tno,t3_esspvc,1579794806.0,"BCH is and has always been a centralized shitcoin that preached AnCap values while destroying most important parts of Bitcoin, such as decentralization and censorship resistance. Technically minded people have always favored BTC over BCH, and that will continue."
GoldandBlack,ffc9ken,t3_esky9l,1579794642.0,"I have a friend that lives in Canada and cannot move to the USA. She's been enamored with the FSP for a long time, but can't move. Where should she move instead?"
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffc3ycc,t1_ffbyin5,1579790949.0,"Also understand that there are many, many counterpoints against MMT. Mainstream economics views MMT like mainstream medicine views homeopathy."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffc3udm,t1_ffc1p9j,1579790872.0,"MMT doesn't really advocate for anything, because it has no models to get recommendations from. MMT gurus make recommendations, sometimes conflicting, often revised heavily upon reexamination, and those recommendations are said to come from the theory. But for as long as MMT is a guru-based economic theory and not a model-based or idea-based system, it can't be seriously understood as producing recommendations.

toronto,ffc2i5k,t1_ffajsoy,1579789904.0,"The priority should always be funneling people into what society needs and has a shortage of, and the way society signals to people what is needed and in short supply is with the price system. The world does not need an additional painter to the same extent as it needs a new chemist, and that is why the prices are different."
researchchemicals,ffa6kxs,t1_ff8a8fw,1579728874.0,"Do you know what the planned episode list is looking like? Following Instagram it seems like he's got Methamphetamine, LSD, 5-MeO-DMT (again), and Iboga so far. Any other thoughts on what might be coming?"
Drugs,ffa5vp7,t3_esemou,1579728490.0,"Nicotine by itself, like in a vape, is about as habit-forming as caffeine in studies. Tobacco is one of the most habit-forming drugs around. So yeah a nicotine vape would be easier to quit that a serious cannabis smoker quitting cannabis in most cases, and waaaayy easier than a smoker quitting tobacco."
Drugs,ffa5o9i,t1_ff9tpsj,1579728376.0,Nicotine or tobacco? Important difference.
MurderedByWords,ffa42k1,t1_ffa0elf,1579727473.0,"If you managed to have the worst timing in the world, and only invested the day before large stock market crashes, you would still be very much ahead in the long term. Weather vs Climate.

PersonalFinanceCanada,fe8re0l,t3_enywae,1578929682.0,"$0 in income means you don't have to file a tax return. Also, even if she had some income for the year she probably wouldn't need to file a return if I'm interpreting your post correctly. If she stayed in Canada for less than 183 days (and doesn't own a house here), then she would be considered a non-resident of Canada and would only need to pay income taxes on Canadian-sourced income."

todayilearned,fcyywvx,t1_fcywh7s,1578090156.0,"But the investors decide the boss and CEO pay, and managers are not relevant investors in the modern large public corp. So why do the investors choose to throw away their money?"
PersonalFinanceCanada,fculz6x,t3_eixwvn,1577983894.0,"If it's physical cash just go to CalForEx, they offer pretty good rates on big amounts. You may have to use a bank draft instead of cash to get a better rate, but look into it. If it's numbers in an online bank account use TransferWise."

technology,fc5iuv4,t1_fc56gwr,1577458803.0,That's because IBM is a dinosaur company that underperforms open source technology. Their sales team got too aggressive and they've damaged the reputation of AI for everyone.
dataisbeautiful,fbk6nsb,t1_fbjuvxf,1576945580.0,That comes out to 725 miles per TON of carbon? Does this assume that OP is the only person on the plane? Seems extremely misleading.
