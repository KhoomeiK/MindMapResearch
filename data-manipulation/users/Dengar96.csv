AskHistorians,ffupg8j,t3_ev71tc,1580246791.0,"This is one of those questions that has about 50 ""right"" answers with the truth being a combination of every one of them. If I'm looking for a time period you want to compare we can look at \~300 B.C. and \~1400 A.D, about 1700 years apart. If you look at the makeup of the nations in the west over that time you can see the breakup of giant, expansive empires and kingdoms into more refined feudal states. You also have a rise in recording events over that time so the movement and histories of smaller groups of people happens more often. On top of this you have the widespread trade, communication, and conflicts of hundreds of people during the time of Agincourt that simply did not exist on the same scale during the time of Alexander. 

In short, you have more people, in more places, recording more things, with interactions between more people. War also becomes something the average landholder can conduct in \~1400 AD, feudal landowners can hire a few thousand soldiers to help fight another landowner from across the river (or chanel in this specific case). During the time of alexander, it would take significantly more time, resources, and reason to muster a state to war readiness, likely taking a large portion of working men and removing them from their homes for years at a time. 

My real point I've wanted to mention here is that there likely was not much of a difference between these periods to the overall scale of battles. For records of battles to make it from \~300 BC to today, they would need to be epic conflicts with one side maintaining their histories for centuries to even make it to modern records. There likely was thousands of agincourt sized battles happening all over but we simply lack the evidence or knowledge to prove they happened. In the time of Agincourt, there were epic massive war's being carried out, just not in the fractured and political seperate parts of Europe we see them happening in modern times.  The Battle of Grunwald had 60000 men participating in it and the whole of the ottoman expansions look like something out of Alexander's legends from millenia before. 

there is no one answer, there is far too much context required to just say reason ""A"" is right."

religiousfruitcake,ffrf2jd,t1_ffreb8r,1580156791.0,It's more a factor of geography imo. The middle East is in the center of old world trade so being friendly was to their advantage.

""Hey, the way you and your roommate joke around makes me uncomfortable and makes me wonder about your relationship.""

With a statement like that, her response should tell you everything. Sometimes bringing something up a couple days removed from the situation can help provide perspective. If she truly thinks of him as a brother then she shouldn't have an issue toning back this sort of stuff and asking him to do the same. If she gets defensive and puts aside your genuine emotions, then maybe the roommate isn't the only problem."
totalwarhammer,ffqxxic,t1_ffqxexx,1580146135.0,"so the game knows you are there but the AI (below very hard difficulty) is really, really stupid.

Knowing that an enemy will virtually always attack your weaker armies if they are within range, you can set your good army to ambush stance in front of your bad army (or settlement) to ambush the eager attacker. You will get an ambush and the weaker bait army is now reinforcing you as well.
