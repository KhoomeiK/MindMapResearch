Serving turn out rated are awful, so most businesses will hire just about anyone willing to do it. Pizza delivery too, and delivery is good money. When I used to deliver I made at least a hundred in tips a night and you get hourly pay. You're not worthless OP. You're not alone either.

offmychest,fepry7m,t3_eqcxn2,1579329237.0,"Hey op, keep your head up. Job hunting is hard right now and I'm in the same boat. Keep your chin up. Try serving or bartending until you can find a better job? If you get a bartender's license you can get a job a bit easier and then move on to retail of you can. Serving turn out rated are awful, so most businesses will hire just about anyone willing to do it. Pizza delivery too, and delivery is good money. When I used to deliver I made at least a hundred in tips a night and you get hourly pay. You're not worthless OP. You're not alone either. I know the jobs I just mentioned aren't the most ideal but they are something, and tips are a good way to get some quick cash. I hope this helps."

That's okay, it comes with life. You went and got tested and its negative. That means you're clean. Even if you did have herpes, many people have it. You can get herpes 1 on your gentiles too. This is a lesson in using protection, even if it's not penetrative. Invest in some dental dams and condoms and you will be okay. Even if you do have herpes as long as you use condoms and have sex when you are not having an outbreak you will be fine. Herpes can often not break out for years at a time, and some times it just lays completely dormant. Take a deep breath. You're fine."
