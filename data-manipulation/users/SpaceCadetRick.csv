You'd still owe it but it could get deferred until you're able to make the payment or you can arrange a payment plan. A lot of places will do the same, banks, hospitals, etc. A lot are bad, for sure, but not everyone is Scrooge McDuck."
recruitinghell,fgue1s7,t1_fgucc2m,1581118532.0,I tried to be a little generous with my costs. Maybe you were doing alright before you lost your job and some of your costs aren't easy to dump immediately. I think a lot of people tend to be optimistic at the start of a job hunt and don't necessarily expect to be hunting for a year or more.
recruitinghell,fgudnhk,t1_fgucex3,1581118262.0,Multiply it by 10 and you could have major market costs too. Or you could plan on commuting to work and not live in a 3 bedroom condo on Michigan Ave...

I mean they are fucking incompetent."

Seems doable if not particularly fun.

Seriously, they don't care that you used to have sex with squirrels or that you habitually jaywalk. If you tell them everything that could be used against you by a foreign power then the threat of ""we know you're a squirrel fucker and you'll lose your job, your home, and your squirrels unless you give us what we want"" won't carry any weight. Plus, have you looked outside? There are squirrels everywhere. The only animal more common would be geese but you aren't some sort of pervert. I feel like I got off track here..."
SecurityClearance,fgm4uvi,t1_fgkp98z,1580918024.0,"Right, the only issue would be that she'd be considered a foreign national since she isn't a US citizen. Still shouldn't be a big deal for OP."
nononono,fgm3pfz,t1_fgm2j47,1580917430.0,"I think it's pretty common in the US, it's usually a lot faster to slow down and make sure everyone sees you vs going in full speed and getting hit. Only time it might be faster is if the ambulance is just outside the hospital and a car hits it, the person flys out the back and lands on an empty gurney being rolled into the hospital for unrelated reasons. But that seems like a low probability situation."

Thing still works, I just used it to drill a 5/8"" hole through a ceiling joist. Can't complain. I also love their really thick nitrile gloves, they don't disintegrate when I use them.
