politics,ffszffz,t1_ffsj5uq,1580199075.0,"Sorry, but I think you're nuts. You're philosophy allows piles of money to be thrown around and gathered unexamined within the families of powerful politicians. It is virtually the same as giving it directly to the politician. I don't give two shits if the politician claims it didn't affect them. Businesses wouldn't be giving that money to people like Hunter Biden if there wasn't strong precedent that it was good for business. And that means the bribe achieves the intended result at least some of the time.

That is corruption, pure and simple. So if it's against the law to give more than a certain amount to the politician, it should similarly be against the law to funnel unlimited money to the family, whether it's thinly disguised as a job or not. I see no valid defense for it simply because it is one tiny step removed from the politician himself."

Come on. There is absolutely, 100% cause to believe that Hunter received a bribe. It was technically legal, but it was still money going into Hunter's pocket for no valid business purpose.

Whether or not that bribe translated to a tangible benefit for the company is irrelevant. A bribe is a bribe, even if we don't ever see the ""quo"".

So when the food that's available in stores gets filled with cheap addictive sugar, we consume more calories.

You are more likely to cause traffic problems and get into trouble yourself if you act like a vigilante. Let the cops handle these people. Stay out of it, unless you have no way to get past them.

Is it really possible to have a superpower who refuses to exploit underdeveloped countries? I think no matter who comes to power, the organization is always infiltrated by opportunists eventually.

I'm not saying we shouldn't try, though. I'll be voting for people with a record of anti-war and anti-corruption. I just don't have much hope that they'll win in the long run.  I'll believe it when I see it."
videos,ffciu44,t1_ffcflmh,1579800389.0,"It's a very difficult topic to discuss online, because people get extreme so fast. And the extreme opinions crowd out the nuanced opinions.

For example, I'd fully support a serious military drawdown, but we also don't want to just open the gates for Russia to take over the world. And yes, both Russia and China literally want to copy what the US did after WW2 and project their military and economic power globally.

What we really need is a UN with some teeth to keep countries from abusing each other militarily and economically. But, ya know, dream on.

I don't know if there is any real solution to this problem as long as human greed exists and there are governments strongly motivated by that greed."

Cammer could have gone a bit slower and looked for traffic, but that's asking a lot. People using the center lane should be vigilant for traffic entering the lane, even when they are using it properly.

edit: Apparently in some areas, the law is different. I really hate when details like this aren't consistent.

However, if this is California as some suggest, they should be using the center lane to merge."
