Americans are so likely to be fat that obesity is normalized and celebrated. Alcoholism and food addiction are both serious and deadly. Because we need food for fuel, we can’t seem to have a conversation about how delicious indulgences can lead to obesity-induced diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, heart attacks, strokes, etc."
AskReddit,fgkzg4m,t1_fgkfhnc,1580877465.0,"I definitely understand depression. Here’s the thing about it though: It’s a nasty liar. Depression is like a warped funhouse mirror that makes absolutely everything look worse than it is. 
You are ONLY 18. You have your literal entire life ahead of you. 
Sit down with paper and something to write with. 
List all the things that you think would be cool to do when you graduate from high school, because you are going to get that diploma. 
Brainstorm how to achieve or access those things. 
Take one action on ONE of those things for yourself. Action is the opposite of depression. It’s hard to feel bad about ourselves and the world when we are busy investing in ourselves. 

I don’t know anything about ski slopes but can you get a snowboard and apply what you know about skateboarding to that in the snow? Winter suuuuucks and it seems like it lasts forever. It takes some serious skill to stay on a skateboard that you can probably apply to something more suitable to living in Utah. 

Look, grown ups don’t have their shit together. Life is tough and messy and full of challenges and problems and people we don’t like and don’t want to deal with. There is always something or someone that tells us or makes us feel like we are doing it all wrong. 

I bet that if you really sat down and quietly meditated on your life, you would be able to come up with a lot of things about being you that are actually really great. Skateboarding, for one. I know you can’t do it in the snow but it’s an amazing skill set to develop. I coincidentally watched a documentary on Netflix last night called, “Dumb: The Story of Big Brother Magazine.” It had me wishing I had taken up skateboarding when I was a kid - that’s my generation. You might check it out. 
I was a professional musician for decades and had to quit playing my instrument because of arthritis. It was a really low period in my life and I had to find something to fill my life that was as gratifying and rewarding as clarinet. It took a while but I started playing guitar and doing art. Nothing will ever replace the clarinet but I love my hobbies today.

AskReddit,fge5937,t3_exydsk,1580691661.0,"I realized that people aren’t paying attention to the things about us that we are self conscious about. No one cares if you are a good or bad dancer. No one worth knowing needs you to sound like an intellectual at all times. No one worth knowing is cataloging everything we do and say in order to pounce on or ridicule us later. 
I realized that being shy was a BIG energy suck. Like, my BODY feels the strain of holding back. The tension of being uncertain LIVES in my body. So I slowly chose to NGAF. I stopped being self conscious about everything from how I dressed to how I walk. I stopped holding my breath and trying to shrink myself down in social spaces. I stood up straight and moved freely. This sounds weird but introverts, I think will understand it. When we feel shy, we try to not take up as much space. Take up that space. Let your body relax in to the space. 

I joined groups and clubs related to my interests. My interests became passions became skills became real talent. 
I also realized that life is freaking short and there is no time to agonize about how people are going to receive me or respond to me. The less I cared, the more I drew the kinds of people to me that I wanted to be around to begin with. 

I’m technically still a shy introvert and you know what? 
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. 
In America, at least, as I won’t’ assume you are American, extraversion is rewarded. We’re an extroverted culture. Quiet, mindful, intentional ways of being are not rewarded. It’s totally normal to be an introvert, by the way. It’s not a shortcoming, it’s a gift. 
I’m what you could call an ambivert now. I seem outgoing but I really, really, really have the emotional and energy needs of an introvert. I like lots of solitude and downtime, especially after socializing because it takes a lot of energy to be with people. 

You have to start considering if the risk of being alone and isolated later in life is worth NOT taking social risks. Say hi to people. They will say hi and smile back. If you feel awkward, good and decent people are going to honor your awkwardness. Even celebrate it. You don’t need to change WHO YOU ARE. Who you are is awesome. It’s not weird to not always know what to say. You know what? It’s OK to be quiet. Sometimes, it’s a relief to be around quiet people not asking demands on our mental and emotional energy.
You just learn slowly how to put yourself in to the social stream and swim, so to speak."

They are so fully committed to their religious dogma that they ignore rational, scientific discourse.
Much of the indoctrination is the Big Brother style order to deny what your own senses are communicating to you. Any empirical arguments used to persuade them are largely fruitless because adhering to faith REQUIRES one to deny what one observes empirically, with respect to many issues. 
There is also a great amount of cherry picking of values, stories and “evidence” for belief from a book that has countless stories that are later refuted or invalidated by other stories in the same book. They are willing to believe things that are contradicted by their own Bible.
