confession,fguutxi,t1_fgtnpa4,1581129923.0,bro you really need to tell someone for the sake of your brothers kids or thier friends. that stuff doesnt just stop. theres never just one kid. he will ruin other peoples lives. even if u feel youce dealt with it your own way others might not be as strong as you. your brother sounds like one sick fuck and something has to be done. you dont want his future sins on your conscience. you would be saving lives not ruining a family.

MawInstallation,fgess1t,t3_exzf9h,1580708707.0,the question is does good and evil actually exist. Nietzsche would say no. morality is a construct and the pursuit of power is a natural constant shared by all life. what is good is whats good for you whats evil is whats evil for you. its not that the sith are rvil its that they live beyond good and evil and thier sole concern is power sometimes only for ones self but also for the empire sometimes at thier own expense. so id say no not inherently but the corruption that comes with power is deff there.
