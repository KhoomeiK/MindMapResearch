todayilearned,feiw5qe,t1_feiv9u5,1579148848.0,"Ehh, kinda. Pixar spun off from Lucasfilm with most of the early funding coming from Jobs. That was years after the divorce when money from Star Wars was dropping off and they didn't have enough work to justify keeping the whole team together for the decade+ it was going to take for technology to advance far enough for a fully animated feature to be realistic."
todayilearned,feiu2jc,t1_feiq1hb,1579147226.0,"Yeah. If he had just laid out the basic framework of the story and had someone else write and direct, as he did with ESB and RotJ, I don't see any reason they might not have come together just as strongly as either of those did. He definitely should have started things with Anakin a bit older, but even that could have worked with the right talent around him."
todayilearned,feitu46,t1_feikpc9,1579147052.0,"She didn't die. They divorced. His resentment over some of the cuts she ""forced"" on him is (reportedly) the source of a lot of the bullshit he then crammed into the Special Editions."

movies,fei1m9j,t1_fehiacb,1579128304.0,Well Ike chopped up the script and changed who the villain was because he didn't think they could sell action figures of a female villain. It is genuinely surprising how well that movie came out considering his meddling.

If I view the videos in my google drive app, they play fine, but as soon as I download them, 3-ish seconds of the beginning of the video display a frozen frame and the section appears white in the video bar below. Is there a solve for this?"
explainlikeimfive,fdksfg8,t1_fdkru1e,1578510191.0,"And then you don’t have the strength to get more food and you die. Makes sense.

Fat is literally there to store energy for later. That is its primary purpose. “Starvation mode“ is pseudoscience invented as a marketing tool to sell food and supplements rather than encourage healthy reduction in meal size and frequency which doesn’t make anyone any money."
todayilearned,fdkrho0,t1_fdjrt0j,1578509631.0,"More likely than not, this was the best way for early man to get meat. Persistence hunting of lame or wounded animals and scavenging other animal’s kills. Usually less effective once you leave the Savanna though, so we started stabbing them in increasingly deadlier ways from further and further away to reduce the time and energy expended following them."
explainlikeimfive,fdkpxo3,t1_fdknpnh,1578508707.0,No it doesn’t. Think about how evolutionarily disadvantageous it would be if an ape stored fat for energy and then used muscles for fuel instead. We were “designed” to be starving half the time.

todayilearned,fd5fagg,t3_ek0xao,1578177051.0,"Big cities are probably full of serial killers but because of how many missing persons cases there are no links can be determined and if the killer is smart and careful enough in disposing of the body, and never kill anyone they could be linked to, they could be active for decades without arousing suspicion.

I do wonder how new technologies have changed serial killer behaviors in the last 10-20 years. The fact that cameras are everywhere and you leave a digital trail nearly anywhere you go has got to make it significantly more difficult to practice the sort of killings we see in popular media depictions of serial killers."

todayilearned,fcw5n7z,t1_fcw4fkd,1578017718.0,Probably not if the reason they don’t stink is genetic rather than based in their skin flora.
todayilearned,fcw3t3e,t1_fcw3ldl,1578016499.0,"It can always change back, but your skin is an ecosystem. If you introduce new yeasts and bacteria that out-compete the existing flora, they'll certainly stick around for a while at least. If your environment is full of the critters that were making you stinky though, it will probably be short-lived."

todayilearned,fcvwzye,t1_fcvqdpl,1578012009.0,"You can change your body flora, which is easier. There are sprays and sticks of better-smelling bacterias and yeasts you can use to replace the stinky ones over the course of a few weeks/months."

intermittentfasting,fctw6c5,t1_fctvwhx,1577962640.0,"We can be realistic without being a dick about it. Wanting to make the change is a major step for someone to take, it just isn’t one that makes a difference without all the work that follows."
intermittentfasting,fcsx58b,t3_eioxwb,1577927342.0,"Protip: Don't make a big ceremony out of starting a new lifestyle change. Wait until you've put in the work to celebrate it. In many people, the dopamine hit from all the congratulations and encouragement actually works against you sticking with it long term, since that dies off after a while and you're just stuck with the hard part.

I do wish you luck though."

It's now 6 months later of eating and drinking pretty much normally (my normal has always been pretty close to a 12/12 or 14/10 schedule), but more mindfully, and I now hover about 5 lbs higher than my lowest weight from fasting.
