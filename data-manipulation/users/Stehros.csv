memes,fguliqy,t1_fgtweji,1581123807.0,"Busting a nut is releasing dopamine and serotonin and because you had a peak of both, everything afterwards feels like depression and regret. The human brain is interesting and fucked up. Like it's trying to get you hooked on a drug. Actually it's the same effect, many drugs are just more intense. The more you know."
Animemes,fguite2,t3_f0b37l,1581121870.0,"Sakurasou no pet kanojo still gets me. Was one of the first anime I watched, and man seeing people not knowing what to do with their life and being simply pressured by people that are talented in the things they do, but at the same time admiring that is so relatable. That show really showed me that no one has it easy, and I'm still asking myself if talent and dedication is worth it and if working hard is ever enough.  The only anime that makes me cry every fucking time."
depression_memes,fgryrdw,t1_fgqr90z,1581063017.0,"That's not true mate. He truly grew on this and learned that he needs to look after himself more and not to be that attached to other people. His girlfriend neglected him and she really didn't want to talk. That kept going for a month, she never wanted to talk, she really ignored him then he wanted to talk about their problems and expected him to read her mind, and immediately know what's wrong with her. He collapsed two times last week and the week before he nearly tried to take his Life. In the end you just need to have a leap of hope and people that stand by your side. He talked with her and just said everything that was wrong with their ""relationship"" . She began to understand. Atleast what he told me and I can only hope. Tough times can be rewarding, you grow in them and they form your character. So I hope you overcome them, mate and I sincerely hope not just you but all the other people on this Reddit can do it to. :D"

wholesomememes,fgry6xf,t1_fgqozcq,1581062310.0,"It really was a friend of mine. His ""gf"" neglected him and never really talked with him anymore, and she didn't even listened to him if he wanted to talk about their problems. Tbh, I still don't like her. But I also felt kinda responsible because I told him to give her a shot. In the end he still somehow told her all his problems and she listened. He told me she understood but tbh I can only hope. He collapsed two times last week. He really deserves a caring girlfriend..."
wholesomememes,fgrxs9g,t1_fgqxhwi,1581061809.0,"That's the spirit. I truly believe that there is a time for everyone to be happy. Not just for a day or a few weeks. Maybe a year or more. People just gotta fight through the tough times and find a leap of hope,sometimes it's your friends that give you that, other times just by acknowledging something and accepting it. Life is weird man. You loose a lot of people but if you keep going you will find future friends and family. Even if you can't imagine it right now. Thats just how life is, fucked up but rewarding."
wholesomememes,fgqbcac,t1_fgq9893,1581021184.0,"Can kinda relate to that. My grandma and my aunt show signs of depression since they are little and I definitely have depression. I surely don't have a down phase all the time but still kinda often. But tbh, as much as I hate it, I try to see it as a new perspective and try to help people even more now. I kinda think it's partially because of the depression, simply because I know it feels that the world is against oneself, so much even that you cap ties and isolate yourself. Because I know how it feels I have the option to talk to them about that. For them to release some air without getting hurt or hurt others. It's just my way to see this. Make the best out of life, even if it's seems like you got banned into the shadow realm.

Also congrats and I hope you will be happy for a long time. Maybe not today or tomorrow but definitely someday it will happen. :D"
wholesomememes,fgq8ctf,t1_fgq7qi6,1581019758.0,"I mean he still has depression. It's a mental illness you have, it's not like he has cured that stuff. It's just, even with depression you still can overcome tough times, it's like playing life on hard. You just gotta go through that down phase. All it needs is a leap of hope."

FreeCompliments,fdosua6,t1_fdnjrky,1578612102.0,"Try to keep the motivation high. I know it's definitely easier said then done, but its pretty much the only way. It's not easy, it's often times actually quite exhausting and people may turn out different then they seemed, but after sometime you will definitely find someone who understands you. I don't believe in destiny, but sometimes it surely feels like that. In the worst case scenario you at least have Reddit and with Reddit come all this nice people that try to make you a bit happier. :D"
FreeCompliments,fdngtpf,t3_ema3dg,1578585504.0,"I'm really bad at stuff like this, but for the beginning I agree with the other people here. You are super cute. The sort of cute that would space me out for a good 5 minutes because I'm thinking about it. (Hope that wasn't creepy or something) I can kinda relate about the whole no purpose in life thing, and I'm also struggling with similar things. So yeah I think I kinda get your point. What helps is just doing. Even if it feels like you don't have the motivation to do stuff, then do the most simple thing you can do to get a bit closer. Like if you want to learn a language, then learn 10 words a day. Or if want to do sports, begin with a few sit ups a day. I think you get the idea. I obviously don't know what you are interested in, so I can't directly help you but I hope that helped a bit. About that thing with your friends. Well first of all, shit must kinda hurt, not being understood sucks hard. So yeah I would recommend searching for new friends, which obviously isn't the easiest thing on the world. But someone gotta make the first step, an yeah who knows maybe you will find a person that understand you just how you want to be understood. I hope that helped, hope everyone has a nice week, even better a good 2020."
