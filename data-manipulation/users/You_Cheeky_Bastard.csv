insanepeoplefacebook,fekmqst,t1_fekj5ur,1579203276.0,"Yea, that was them. They also want to boycott Netflix because of the gay Jesus show, want Hallmark off the air because they support LGBTQ, they have a problem with the Mr Rogers movie, a problem with a hotels.com commercial, have a problem with Kellogg's because they had a cereal box with rainbow colored letters on it, problems with Target, problems with whole foods, they wanted Lucifer taking off the air, wanted 13 Reasons Why dropped because the ads were ""perverted"", and these aren't even half the examples of absurdity.  The only reason I know it's real and not satire is because I used to troll their facebook page during the whole Arthur thing. They eventually caught on to my sarcasm and started deleting all my comments."

I don't have an argument either way on the gender thing, I just let people identify however they want and live and let live. I can't see a nation that doesn't even have universal healthcare as being considered ""the greatest nation."" Hell, there are nations out there with more freedoms than us. Yeah, Trump is the president, no shit! But I'm still going to disrespect the hell out of him because he hasn't done anything worthy of respect ever since he started this fucking circus of a presidency. The burden of proof is on the person making the claim of God being real, and we still have yet to see any physical proof of the existence of God."
