This disorder, is usually not something that you question for long, as it’s usually glaringly obvious but, even then, it’s armchair psychiatry without a diagnosis from a mental health professional. 
It’s easy to look for explanations to label our problems. Try to fit it all in a box. If I know what it is, it’s a little less scary. 
But, I feel like conjecture on this topic is just as dangerous as the disorder. 

In short, resistors can not diagnose the person in question based on a single trait. Opening a dialogue with this person is the only way you’ll find out more. Ask them to go to a therapy session with you. Best of luck!"

She kicked in the door, grabbed my most expensive guitar and started swinging it in a circle, trying to destroy everything in the room, hitting me with it, and throwing the guitar into the wall, ending the physical part of the tantrum. 
I ran to the spare bedroom so I had a working lock between us again. She started throwing her things, lots of glass related items, tried kicking in the spare room door, failed, then called our therapist/counselor. 
I could hear her accusing me of doing all the things she just did/said to me, to the therapist. I yelled through the door that I was scared and for her to tell the truth. She said exactly this in response; “it’s my stuff, I can break it if I want”. 
The therapist finally calmed her down but I hid in that room for over a week until she moved out. 
She found out she was pregnant and I’m currently in a custody/paternity battle.

“Who did I think I was? I couldn’t save her. I don’t even know what needs fixing in my own life.”

How do I get back to normal when I’m not sure I ever knew what “normal “ was?
I don’t do any of my old hobbies; music, painting, drawing. I feel violated in every area of my life and safety feels like a myth.

BPDlovedones,ffa0pti,t3_erllyz,1579725536.0,"Oh, do I? 
(This is really long, sorry)

Her (exwBPD) therapist stood in front of the door and trapped me in the room with the both of them, fully knowing the abusive past she has with me, refusing to let me leave until I answered questions I didn’t have answers to. I finally got agitated and raised my voice to say I needed to leave because I didn’t feel safe, multiple times before I was able to leave. (I, stupidly, came back to say how unprofessional and unsafe that behavior was and I wouldn’t be returning, only to have it thrown back in my face as aggressive behavior later on)
Since Im the one who refused to go back to the same person I have been, solely, tasked with finding a replacement. With very strict preferences, other than the obvious need for a professional who understands BPD and the challenges of working with someone diagnosed. In session and in between. 
Here’s her rules: 
No white men/women close to her parents age. (Gay men ok. As if I can search by sexual preference)
No people younger than her. 
So, I’m left with ethnic women or gay men 30–45. 

We (me and exBPD) are separated and have a child together, which is why I’m actually attempting this nearly impossible task. 
So, I finally find, what seems to be a perfect match, through a recommendation by my roommate who heard me struggling with this. Roommate then reveals she was also diagnosed with BPD, I’m a magnet for it, apparently. (I have another story about her that happened recently, but it’s unrelated)
I setup the appointment and pour out my heart. I mentioned our child by name and the therapist face changed. She stopped me and said, “I have to let you know that I know your ex” so immediate bias-can’t work with her. The only person capable and fitting of criteria 
And she already knows my ex from the rooms of AA. 
Total. Mind. Fuck. 
ExBPD changes medications, dr says it’s gonna get worse before it starts to work and the terror cycle begins. 
She was dropping our son off for overnight stay. She starts making ultimatums that I can’t agree with and things are getting heated so I asked her to leave, just like we learned in therapy. She finally said ok after repeating myself many times, and asked to say goodbye to our son. I was holding him the entire time. I really thought she was going to just hug and kiss him and leave. She had been doing so much work and seemed to have progressed a lot. 
Nope! She ran out the door screaming nasty things at me while our 20month old child is looking on in horror. What do I do? I don’t want to make it worse for our son and yell back or chase after them. I froze. They pulled away as my son looked out the window, so confused and terrified. I was absolutely heartbroken. I thought I knew heartbreak from our previous breakups before our child but, no. This has taken all my will. 
Fast forward a few more months of trying to find a therapist and a custody lawyer. 
My Lawyer was dragging ass on delivering papers. But the ex was still ok with a session. It was Christmas time and I wanted to give my son his gifts. 
So, I find another therapist who fits close enough so I leave a message asking to speak with them. (There’s a list of questions I got from a book called Walking on Eggshells, that I wanted to ask her)
As I’m on the phone with this possible new therapist, the exBPD texts me saying to cancel it and NC until I hear from HER lawyers. She must’ve gotten the papers as I was on the phone. Fml
I’ve heard from her lawyers and have responded. Waiting on her now."

I don’t want to think about my wounds but, others speak so openly, I can get jealous that they have moved past the shame enough to shed light on such things.

I hide my fears in passive-aggressive statements, only to realize that I’m only convincing myself. 
Changing the outside world is Ineffective when my insides are exploding. Anger and judgement are easy and comfortable compared to dealing with my real emotions. 
So I will complain about you and minimize my problems while, also, self-aggrandizing to release tension.
