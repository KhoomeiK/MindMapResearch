My pothos was doing very well until last week. Leaves are going yellow and curling. It's gone limp as well. I watered, waited a few days and even repotted/cut off any roots that might have rotted. I'm really emotionally attached to this plant and I'm hoping to save it. In the event I need to just take a cutting, any tips there?"

makemychoice,fcr6cxu,t3_eietyq,1577897437.0,"I recommend really researching and trying to find people from that field to talk to to get a true grasp of the job. The reality of the job might be very different from what you imagine or experienced so far. It could have significant downsides you haven't considered. I used to want to go into academia really strongly but speaking with professors/academics and joining subreddits that talk about the day to day life of those in such positions has shown me significant downsides to that route such as job insecurity, fatigue, etc. that I felt wasn't worth it for me."
