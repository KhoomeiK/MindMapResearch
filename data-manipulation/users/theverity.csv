I looked at how you solved 1 and honestly have no clue what you did. 

Basically one solves systems with substitution by solving the first equation for x, so you have x=....

Then you put that x=... in the second equation, you replace every x in the second equation with [...]. In your case it will be x=something with y, which means that I’m the second equation you’ll only have y’s and numbers. 

Then you solve the second equation for y, so you have y=number. Then you work out x using x=... from the first equation and y= number. 

As your result you should have x=number and y=number.

GetMotivated,fezx5vz,t3_eqvo6v,1579462833.0,"I understand why a lot of people don’t like this graph, but  the advice “listen while others talk” is life changing.

Recently I went to Iceland, I’m young and went alone, the whole time I had to keep reminding myself to listen to others instead of talk about myself. By taking to time to really understand what the other person was saying to me, I leant a lot and came into contact with so many new ideas and wordviews.

Algebra,femhwj3,t3_epxvb4,1579256421.0,"This is solved with all the steps. https://imgur.com/gallery/tR5GFQe


The first thing I did was factorise the bottom equations. It’s mainly an exposure thing, that led me to immediately identify (y^2-9) as a third binomial (y+3)(y-3) and the last as (y-1)(y+3). 

After that I gave the entire equation a common denominator and effectively multiplied each term by 1;
ex. https://imgur.com/gallery/HTACwPB

After doing that I simplified the top half, by multiplying as needed but being careful to keep all the parenthesis’ in place, in order to avoid making a sign error (don’t know the word in English, basically just accidentally turning a - to a +). 

Then I dissolved the parenthesis’ and highlighted everything that had the same power. 

After adding/subtracting them I tried to further simplify by taking out a minus : -(), thinking I could factoids the top half into terms like the ones on the bottom and then strike them out.

Unfortunately that isn’t possible here (in the square to the side I tried), so I dissolved the parenthesis’ on the bottom half and dibble lined it. That is the finished equation."

fatlogic,fdaxkjt,t1_fd98iyv,1578251576.0,"What gives you the right to judge someone like that? What qualifies you to decide the death of another? 

Very little. 

Just because someone has committed a terrible and horrible crime and you have the power to condemn him to death, doesn’t mean you’re morally allowed to act on it. Judging and sentencing criminals is reserved for judges, who act according to the law. In the USA it’s still legal to sentence people to death, but in much of the world it isn’t, there are many reasons for this, but extremely relevant is that the death penalty takes away a fundamental human right: living, and it inspires the illusion, that we have the right to murder people. An illusion many embrace and use to take justice into their own hands, like you suggested. 

It’s a hard truth, but people like you and me shouldn’t be taking justice into our own hands. It’s not our place to decide who may live and how may not, it’s merely our obligation to not allow a preventable death."
fatlogic,fd88ku8,t1_fd7ckey,1578215245.0,"I’m not actually part of this discussion and I’m not about to comment on veganism.  Instead I’d like to challenge your statement “Imagine claiming to know what is morally right.”

While there are many complex philosophical questions that require a solid understanding of the issue, there are also many where the answer is clear and you can easily say what is morally right. 

Imagine that an unknown person is standing on the road and you’re standing next to it. You see a car approaching and know, that if you warn the unknown person, that they will be able to move in time and subsequently live. Should you say nothing despite knowing that you could save them, then you would be acting morally wrong. For not helping someone clearly contradicts our social morals. 

There are many other examples where what is wrong and right is clear to see. Judging something as morally right or wrong is not a power reserved for the gods. Humans are very capable of philosophising so long as they have an understanding of its bases."
