AskReddit,ffv31qi,t1_ffu1qak,1580254526.0,My friend was 42 and healthy. Avid swimmer. Two daughters under the age of 5. His wife found him unresponsive last week and he's gone. It's unreal and I've been having a bit of an existential crisis since. I wish you a long lifetime of health.
worldnews,fftk9su,t1_fftbxf7,1580222745.0,"I've had zero side effects. However, there are reports that cancer and heart problems have happened. So I don’t know what to do. I should stop but can’t live with full body hives every day."
worldnews,ffseb7v,t1_ffsc8p3,1580179629.0,"Xolair is a miracle drug. I would have full-body hooves almost every day. Except my face. The shots cleared it up in 2 days. Been on it for about a year and I want to get off, there are some concerning side effects. But a couple months ago, I slipped a month to see what would happen, and they came back at the end of that second month. :( Still take hydroxyzine and doxepin but I don't think they help at all, so will talk to my feet about that soon. What about you? What's your story?"
worldnews,ffsbmpq,t1_ffs5jyu,1580177857.0,"Chronic idiopathic urticaria here! Hooray for these drugs until times like these, right?"
news,ffof3df,t1_ffochgv,1580077023.0,"Wow, sounds like you've got some unresolved issues. Take it out on something other than this thread, dude"
Instagramreality,ffn88wy,t3_eu5vva,1580063020.0,"THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE. It's like my face is falling a bit, and it's not excess weight. I'm 40 this year and just have the start of the jowls going on. I am SO self conscious about it, so I do understand where she's coming from."
worldpolitics,ffi1eir,t1_ffho0o5,1579962178.0,"Not just funds. Multiple warehouses full of things like bottled water, food, diapers, etc were recently found. They had all of that and the people never knew."
90DayFiance,ffgiyq5,t1_fffrjia,1579907315.0,"I really liked those two. Very genuine, and I'm really excited for them! I'm sure they'll really be good parents with both sides of the family supporting as well."
worldnews,fffz5o8,t1_fffyuga,1579894982.0,I've had a stressful day and this made me laugh. Thank you.
news,fffboza,t1_ffee255,1579880429.0,I'm immunocompromised. I don't want to go anywhere right now tbh
fatpeoplestories,fff3onh,t3_et0ns8,1579874856.0,"I work with one. He smells so bad that you can tell he's arrived without even seeing him or hearing him. He breathes with his mouth open and his epiglottis kind of rattles with every breath. Grunts a lot, even just when sitting. I cannot stand it."
Botchedsurgeries,ff92inu,t1_ff8lzhj,1579703247.0,Yup! Seriously this surgery was life-changing. Unreal the amount of difference it made. It's not horribly painful either.
antiMLM,ff7givg,t1_ff74f0s,1579649024.0,I'll send you the address for Apple maps if you want? I already got this one I see now on Google a while ago.
antiMLM,ff7gflr,t1_ff79jak,1579648964.0,"I see that, thanks. Says you can report businesses out of homes. I hope that it doesn't tell her I did it though."
Sororities,ff6pith,t3_erthc0,1579632179.0,"You have two big things against you, one being an upperclassman (though that matters less in certain schools, if Greek life isn't big there you may be OK) and the other being the GPA. Many chapters will have higher requirements than the minimum, and that will be something that no personality could get you through. Is there a way to take extra classes beforehand to boost the GPA? Your first year in a sorority will be very busy. Since you're getting close to graduating, you should try to concentrate on graduating with a decent GPA, in my opinion. Good luck in whatever you choose!"
Botchedsurgeries,ff1hig4,t1_ff041iz,1579479313.0,"Look into it. I had my deviated septum repaired and a turbinate reduction, and my nose is like a wind tunnel now. Literally life-changing. Didn't change what it looked like outside either."

Botchedsurgeries,fev9y9r,t3_ep67fp,1579394919.0,"Hi! I know I'm a couple days late, but a septoplasty was one of the best decisions I've ever made. No change to the outside, but after a couple days of a bit of pain, it was amazing. I felt like the side I couldn’t breathe out of was then a wind tunnel! Let me know if you have any questions and I can let you know my experience :)"
Botchedsurgeries,fev8pgz,t1_feuezry,1579394429.0,"So I'm aging, and have a thin face with skin that falls, looking a bit jowly. Only happened within the last year or so. I'm looking for something to help, but everyone offers fillers. I would honestly rather have a facelift than fillers, based on what I've seen when people get them, but I'm just 39 and I feel like that's too young. So now I'm just super self conscious about my face."
AskReddit,feuznwi,t1_fet1x17,1579391511.0,"My husband and I watch TV every night for about 20-30 mins after our daughter hours to sleep just to unwind. Over the past couple of months, we've been completely silent except for saying the same thing at the same time in reaction, make the same hand movement at the people on TV at the same time, etc probably 7 or 8 times. So over a half hour show, we say or do nothing except for one thing, whatever it is. I love it."

AskReddit,fei7zq6,t1_fegv54o,1579132318.0,I get messages from my husband saying things like he wants to talk when I get home from work and he will never tell me what it's about. So I spend all day super anxious and then it ends up being something like what he was thinking of doing that next weekend. Ffs.
rickygervais,fehb1w6,t1_feg3r64,1579112872.0,"Dumb question- this isn't the same podcast where he had Stephen and Karl in every episode and they were the basis for the Ricky Gervais cartoon show, is it?"
