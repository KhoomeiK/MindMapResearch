We provided her with several pools in the summer time to hang out in while she was younger and all through the winter she had a dog house with straw on top, but most of the time she just slept on our deck.  She always melted a spot right on the corner no matter how thick the snow was.  She was always fine.  As she got older though, and her sister died, we transitioned her into an indoor dog.  She fucking loved the AC, I think this was a dream come true for her, but every single winter she wanted to be outside for all of the daylight hours.  As soon as it got dark, she would come in, but if you tried to get her in any other time she just looked at you like you were insane.  She would lay down in a snow bank during a blizzard and just sleep all day long.  It was weird, but clearly she had all of the advantages required to thrive in this environment."
