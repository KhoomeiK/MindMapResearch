socialanxiety,fdnngv6,t3_emc60a,1578589449.0,"I always go to the same petrol station to fill up my bike but always at weird time like 3am. Well the people recognise me now and I guess they’re so bored at that time so we actually have conversations and it’s such a good feeling. I kinda use it to practice conversations too, is that strange?"

depression,fdnkupe,t3_em63s0,1578587914.0,"Same thing happened to me. Girlfriend broke up with me a few days before my 21st, same day I lost my license. None of my friends wanted to come over for a drink or anything even though they were all free. So I got super drunk, accidentally told them I was probably going to kill myself that night. They told me to stop talking about this shit because it’s not going to help. So yeah, no ones cares and fuck everyone :)"

socialanxiety,fb0bwqi,t3_eaop7t,1576424621.0,"Yeah same here, was seeing an awesome girl for a month. Complete opposite of me though , super outgoing and everyone loves her. But I just couldn’t be fucking normal and had to be an awkward piece of shit and fucked it all up.  All I want is to be normal, why is it so hard  :/"
