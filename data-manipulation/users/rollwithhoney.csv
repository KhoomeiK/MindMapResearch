MagicArena,ffnf79i,t3_eu9xk6,1580065205.0,"I am utter garbage at building decks but what I've learned is that your deck needs a specific goal. In Brawl, when you have 60 unique cards, you pick a commander when you pick the goal and flesh out the deck based on what goes with it (ex: Kiora behemoth beckoner draws whenever you play a 4/4, so it's a deck full of cheap blue green 4/4s that overrun the opponent). In Standard, you'll be tempted to just shove in all of the ""good"" cards with right mana colors but instead you need to pick a goal, pick 8 or 9 cards that help with that goal, and have 2-4 copies of each of those cards, preferably on a nice mix of mana costs. Examples of goals are: killing your opponent by repeatedly summoning/sacing cauldron familiar and witches oven, killing the opponent unexpectedly fast by flashing in Embercleave, stacking up a powerful effect that buffs all of your card abilities like Devotion or Undergrowth, or just building a deck around really strong & efficient cards like Heliod"

You can force the player to sacrifice them and you can also make it cease to exist with -1/-1 counters, [[Witch's Vengeance]], [[Weight]], and ofc exile it. So if you see a card that makes a creature -X/-X it's generally better than regular damage because it can kill indestructible things too.
