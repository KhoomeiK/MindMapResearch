The streaming tech Shadow uses is really impressive. Also have to give endless praise to the Virtual Desktop developer. I played through all of Arizona Sunshine so far (not a very optimized game in general though) and played around The Lab a bunch (This runs fantastically). Skyrim with just ini tweaks runs smoother than expected but i wanted to diminish the blur effect so I downloaded some mods like DyndaLOD. These mods make it run a little worse but it is still very playable and I can clearly see things past 25 ft finally. I'm sure my setup would be blasted by some who are used to crisp 100+ frame headsets, but being able to toss on the Quest, open up Virtual Desktop and play Skyrim with no wires or expensive PC FAR outweighs the quality loss for me."
