coolguides,fbnj81d,t1_fbn0s57,1576998636.0,"Agreed, I apologize non stop usually and most my friends are sick of it. I apologize when I shouldn't have to. But it's hard to stop because then I think I'm selfish. Also moved back with my parents after a few years on my own, and now I'm apologizing even more (for pretty much everything). It's not only for ones with narc tendencies I think but also for parents who can be dramatic and act hurt so you help them/go over your own boundaries."
