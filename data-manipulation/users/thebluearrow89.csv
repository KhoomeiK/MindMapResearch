TalesFromTheCustomer,ffy048z,t3_evtlwu,1580335878.0,"I must say, thank you for standing up to that cashier. I work on the phone with customers and we often had cases where one person lied about what was said. One time, 3 others were around and a woman got so unfriendly, she was put on speaker.
My coworker was calm (the customer had ordered something and made an error) and tried to handle it but the woman later wrote to the manager 100 % bullshit. There were luckily 3 of us listening.
I dont understand what a person must go through to try to ruin other people's life."
