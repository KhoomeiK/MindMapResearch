The reason I took 207/208 over the algebra-based track is because 207/208 had short-answer style exams with partial credit as opposed to all-or-nothing multiple choice. Being a sub-par physics student, I figured I could probably figure out most of an answer but not all of an answer. So, short-answer style exams seemed like the safest bet. The calculus we used in 207/208 was minimal, if any. I think it comes down to personal preference."
UWMadison,fdhr414,t3_el311y,1578428528.0,"From my personal experience (for reference, I took chem 109/343/344/345, physics 207/208, stats 371, bio 151/152,  biochem 501) -

Difficulty (most to least): 109 > 207 > 345 > 208 > 344 > 151 > 152 > 343 > 501 > 371

Enjoyment (most to least): 343 > 501 > 345 > 151 > 208 > 344 > 371 > 152 > 207 > 109

I also used this exercise to kind of reflect back on the classes I took, and see if I would give advice to my former self. I think the biggest thing I would tell myself to do is pay more attention in physics 207/208. There is a lot more physics in med school than I ever would have thought going in. I kinda just brute-forced my way through physics without really taking the time to understand it.

Thanks for the question! I had some fun reflecting back!"

Thanks for sharing and best of luck!"
college,fcnrood,t3_ei1gja,1577817145.0,"It's good that you are thinking about back-up plans, but honestly you only live one life. I say go for your dream, especially if it is something obtainable like medicine. People may say becoming a physician is beyond your reach, but I really don't think it is. You obviously have passion, and from what you've said you seem to be ready to put the work in. Your GPA is not bad. I'd say, considering your circumstances, you've done quite well for your self and medical schools likely will understand that too. One C in an ethics class will not make a difference if you continue to work hard towards those good grades. Like you said, it will be challenging. It may take you more time to get all the requirements in order for medical school, but I see no reason why you cannot chase this dream. As for financials, in recent years med schools have really tried to make the process more accessible to those with financial limitations. There are options out there, it is just a matter of finding and learning about them. For example, the MCAT and AMCAS (med school application) both have fee assistance programs. Med schools themselves offer a lot of financial aid. There are ways to help ease the financial burden, if you put in the work to seek them out.

Also, I think working as a medical interpreter (at least for a year or two) is a great idea. Not only will it earn you some money, it also would look really good on a medical school application for when you decide to apply.

You can do this. One of my friends was in a similar situation as you. He originally came here as a refugee, and is now an MD/PhD student. It is possible. It will be a lot of hard work, but it is possible if you have the determination."
UWMadison,fcnp09f,t1_fcm3uax,1577815697.0,"UW Hospital gets so many volunteer students each year that it's kind of a hard place to start. You'd have to sign up a semester in advance to start volunteering. I want to give a quick shout out to another hospital that is an amazing volunteering experience but seems to get no love from the student community - the VA Hospital. It is right next to UW Hospital, and they always seem to be looking for volunteers. I absolutely loved working with the veteran patients there. It can be kind of rough at times, but it is a truly rewarding experience!"
UWMadison,fcnn81p,t3_ei1v2a,1577814695.0,"The primary question an admissions committee seeks to answer is ""Will this student be successful at this school?"" This question has several components. Obviously, first and foremost is academics. SAT/ACT scores and GPA are really important in determining whether or not a student is ready to handle the academic rigor of college. But, importantly, bare academics is not the only factor. Admissions committees also want to see maturity and motivation in the student. College is very different from HS. You are operating independently, and have to be very self-motivated. Even if a student has a stellar academic record, if they do not demonstrate maturity and motivation, they are unlikely to be as successful as a student with worse numbers but more maturity and drive. They only real way an admissions officer can garner insight into these traits is through the essay and extracurriculars. So to answer your question, the essay is an important aspect of your application. A good essay can shore up any shortcomings in your application and can clinch the acceptance if the numbers are right. It can tell the admissions officer that you are ready to tackle *all* the challenges of higher education, not just the coursework.

Anecdotally, I was a C/D student for the first few years of high school. I wised up and did better in later years, but it took awhile. Needless to say, my GPA was not exactly up to scratch. UW-Madison took a chance on me. I don't have any direct evidence, but I feel this is primarily because of my essays (I don't know what else it could have been). Take that for what it's worth, I guess."
college,fc1jgtv,t1_fc0z4sj,1577320589.0,"I second talking to an advisor.

Just my two cents (and I am not an expert), but I don't think retaking the class is the right move so long as you passed. Rather than retaking, I think the better option is to try to do well in future chem classes. It shows med schools that you can bounce back and do well in the topic. If you retake the class at a community college, I imagine med schools will not take it super seriously.

So long as you can improve going forward, most med schools are willing to overlook a D."

I think the pre-med specific clubs are decent at helping you find shadowing opportunities, but outside of that I'm not sure what they offer. Maybe MCAT resources? Though I've heard they can be helpful for some, I urge you not to limit your search to just pre-med specific clubs."
