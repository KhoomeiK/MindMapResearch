There's also videos that day of them harassing women and hollering, ""It isn't rape if you like it!""  Which is doubly compounded by the fact that one of the seniors from that school *at that time* was awaiting sentencing for his *second* rape conviction.  But then again, I don't expect you to actually care about the facts.  Yeah, I know, the black isrealites were provoking them, too.

TD will get banned, because they're a hate subreddit and they deserve to be gone.  They've brigaded, they've quarantine evaded, and they've broken enough rules frequently enough that they should have been left already.

> Not only that, but Trump is a huge supporter of Israel. Actual Nazis do not like Trump. You want to talk Nazis? How about how the left hates Israel.

> You do understand that ""company you keep"" falls apart when on Reddit you can go from a subreddit to another subreddit in a matter of seconds.

I didn't say a single thing about any of the Trump voters, I said that about one specific r/the_donald poster who was also a chronic troll and liar.  And here you are doing the same thing by lying about what I'm saying because you're a sycophant and a coward.

IAmA,ffvlcwd,t1_ffuh2bp,1580266835.0,"Now that I'm back at a keyboard, let's unpack this hot mess.

> You're the one making the claim that participation in arguably the largest non-default subreddit on this site invalidates someone's opinions on everything. It's your job to prove that, not my job to disprove it.

No, that's the interpretation of what I said that you chose to make it easier to argue against it.  What I'm actually saying is the company people choose says a lot about them.  If, in example, someone were living in a house where literally everybody else is a literal Nazi, you could reasonably assume several things about the person.  While they are also *most likely* a Nazi, there's a tiny possibility that they aren't.  However, they are at the very least perfectly comfortable living with actual nazis.

> But on top of that, I haven't looked into it, but NAMBLA is likely an organization you have to sign up for. Whereas anyone here can go into TD and post.

A membership card is irrelevant.  What matters is what company you're choosing to keep.

> But on top of that, you're ignoring someone due to their personal political beliefs without actually arguing the point. Hypothetically, say me and you were arguing between Xbox and PlayStation. Then you say I'm a pedophile because of a NAMBLA membership. What would that have to do with the Xbox/PlayStation argument? How does that actually change anyone's mind?

That's your willful misinterpretation.  What I'm saying is if you willingly live with nazis, you're going to have people suspect that at the worst you're a nazi yourself, or at least comfortable living with nazis.  Metaphorically speaking.   Let me know if you need smaller words.

> It doesn't. It gives you, and others reading an easy way to ignore points in order not to argue what's there.

No, it gives us context about the mental capacity of the person making the argument.  If you in example as a dog turd chewing enthusiast were to then go on and start lecturing people about hygiene, then yeah, people are going to point out that you literally like chewing dog turds.  Welcome to life in general.  

> I don't care if you're comparing a Ferrari to a Porsche with Hitler. You stick to the actual argument. Branching out to attack someone makes you look weak and unable to actually argue the points.

Context matters.  There are some situations where the context makes it evident that people aren't capable of making a plausible or rational argument, or that they belong to a group that is *extremely well known* for arguing in bad faith, in example trolling.  It's okay to dismiss someone if there's more than enough context that suggests that what they're bringing to the table isn't going to be worthwhile.

> Now say we were comparing Electic cars to efficient diesel cars and you just happened to be Elon Musk, then that would be proper to bring up, as you would personally be benefiting from Electic car sales and would have a bias.

> However the average conservative doesn't gain anything from wanting more nuclear power over wind/Solar. Except for a better country. But I digress. Keep the conversation to the point if you want anyone to take you seriously.

The average conservative doesn't want a better country.  To be specific, they want a better country *for themselves at the expense of other people*.  They treat the country as a zero-sum game.  They think that if they need to win, it has to come at the cost of someone else.

I went running outside, shouting, ""We're at war!""  We were already sure Bin Laden was behind it, because he'd already tried to blow up the world trade center once with a bomb in a van that didn't do the trick.  Anyway, they locked down the base, threw all the civilians off of it, and we waited.  I was at MCRD San Diego, right next to the airport, so we all half expected to get hit also.

We'd heard all kinds of things, like bombs going off at the state department, planes crashing in corn fields (that one was right), the pentagon being hit... it was a hell of a day.  *Everybody* was glued to the televisions and itching to put one hell of a hurting on anyone and everyone responsible.

[I point you towards what I'm testing now.](https://old.reddit.com/r/ShadowPC/comments/er75i1/whens_the_ultra_and_infinite_plan_coming_the_us/ff2qa7i/)  It's a third party cloud storage company that has an app that lets you treat that storage as a local drive, sort of.  I paid $10 for a month long test of having 2TB.  So far I've got Ark Survival and Fallout 76 installed on it with more to come.  

Early results seem promising.  It isn't flawless.  Installations can be a bit cranky sometimes.  I believe that you need sufficient local space to transfer over files during install so you can't be packed to the brim already.  There's also a cache the software for the third party storage that needs to be flushed after every install.  With Fallout 76 it seems like it needs to verify files now and then.  Steam sometimes has to be reminded that there's a steam folder on the new drive.
