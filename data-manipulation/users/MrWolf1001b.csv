Buy as low as possible, say at 9.3$ once it pings back up above a certain value dump the stocks.

Think it's high volume (but low margins?) not really sure. You can make some money doing it.Most trading is done by super fast algorithms that are programmed to buy when certain criteria is met and sell once it reaches a set profitability. 10 000 stock at 9.3, 93 000 USD, remember a couple weeks back it jumped up to >10.2$ for a while? Well, talking as much money as almost 100k USD a 10% increase within 5 days means selling that stock nets you 9300 USD, in 5 days. The gamble paid off, then the stock price crashed cause everyone that was looking for a quick 10% return dumped the stock.

People will hate me for typing this, but think of the cartoons where the bully picks up the victim, turns it upside down then shakes, coins drop out of the victim's pockets.

Then you buy low again and hope there are chumps investing - the victims in the cartoon example -  (think retirees, people with money, whooed by the promise of ""online jobs are the future!"", out of touch with reality, hype train, like bitcoin was exploited).

Upwork is a commodity, the ones losing money are the gullible that take a chance to believe the marketing promise of incredible returns. Those people lose money.Who makes money? The sharks. For a big bank, risking 93k for 10% profit is a gamble but just like the clients that would pay 10$ for work that's unusable and just absorb the loss, so can such a big investor.(Most big backers have pulled out, the change of management is just a sign that the boat has a leak somewhere. When you're dying you're gonna try anything to cure that illness.

Why would anyone join a failing company? Compensation packages. You probably read about CEOs or CFOs leaving a company and getting millions in compensation. It's a win for them, the only downside is the gamble that another company won't touch you - hire you - since it looks as if you couldn't help save the company you left. Do you really care when you have 4-8-12-20 million $?

\-edit- to the Upwork marketing fellas, time to hit the news with some more posh bs promises, make that stock go back up.   


I forgot to add, it's a free ride. You see, the shark doesn't invest anything to hype the stock, Upwork diverts funds to hype people (expensive marketing), and their big investors, who want the stock to grow.   


Slamming a paraplegic repeatedly, head-first into the ground must feel good (I imagine, ofc). The new wave of freshly boarded freelancers Upwork took in during the Nov-Dec 2019 period are also going to come on here and the public forums with incredible success stories, which in turn please a potential investor (credibility, so the retiree with a couple million can feel safe dumping that money just to lose it). It's gorgeous!   


This last paragraph also explains why there are Upwork staff brigading this subreddit (I have no proof, most likely the admins do, if they can see downvote patterns somehow). Any bit of bad publicity affects the stock. It could even not be Upwork staff but someone with enough money to pay a bunch of people to control a narrative, I don't know for sure.

That being said, I kindly disagree, my friend. On the client side, a US client's default job market is US (since upwork is split into US jobs and ""Freemarket worldwide jobs""). You can tell by their level of English that they're at least US/UK, not saying other countries are not English proficient. Hold on a second!  


To get to the point of this. If US clients using Upwork are defaulted to post the jobs US Only (it's an option in the client account), and they click to change it from the default to ""Worldwide"", 100% they're looking to pay as cheap as possible.   


There's no other reason ... why would I look for a non-native English speaker for English articles unless I plan to pay the least possible?"

It could be people get tired of seeing the same thing over and over again. It could be that Upwork employees visit here regularly and try to brigade (upvote positive stuff about Upwork, downvote negative stuff) and curate what shows up on the subreddit and what doesn't.

I've tried to have a conversation of how the vast majority of Upwork ""employers"" are fishing for the opportunity of a lifetime, to not much luck.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VDiM\_PMmZA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VDiM_PMmZA)    


From what I understand, there's these ""financial gurus"" that promise to teach people how to get rich fast. Usually it's through offering zero value themselves (because they don't know how to CREATE anything, so they're looking for ONE SCHMUCK to bring the value they can't).   


Have you seen the ""write, edit, make me a book cover/e-book for Amazon KDP"" jobs, for 50-100-200$?  There's many of them! Don't bother with these.   
Your example of 300$ for youtube content, same thing.  


These people pay a ""guru"" a lot of money to learn how to ""get rich quick"". One can't get rich quick with 50$, zero skill to build/create ANYTHING. But they're fishing for suckers, on platforms like Upwork ...  


Upwork in itself is a ""scam"", since it can be abused by shady clients in finding that sucker to enable their 'passive income' dream.   


If someone had the skills to : write the script, film, and upload to youtube. Why wouldn't they do it for themselves? The potential to earn from youtube would be greater than 300$ a month.   


The job itself comes with the implication that the videos would be 'high quality', at least high enough quality to pull in more than the 300$ the 'client' pays you. If they pocket the difference, why not you get the entire sum of money? Skip this client, do it for yourself.   


Unfortunately there's many desperate freelancers that accept. Wanna bet these freelancers get fired after a month?   


Why so? Well the client won't see immediate returns, which they will expect, because they learned nothing real from the financial guru that took their money. They're not business people, just scammers.   


Through extension, the students of the financial guru are scammers themselves. They have no skills themselves, so their only chance to get rich as they hope to be, is to find a sucker that would fill in the skills-effort gap they lack for very little money.   


This isn't unique to Upwork, happens on Fivver as well. Don't sweat it. Karma is real :)"

Been there, done that, half a dozen times until I just gave up doing logo design at all. There are free websites online that auto-generate logos. The client could just go on there and get it for free instead of paying 5$ or Fivver prices.   


""Business owner"" lawyers wearing 1000 $ shoes not understanding that in making a custom logo, I'd have to at least see what other law office businesses are in their vicinity so I don't ""rip off"" a design idea (since everything can only be spun so many ways to make it 'original').   


I asked one how much they spent that day for breakfast, lunch and dinner - highly unprofessional of me! oh my! - the answer came to 50ish dollars. Then I asked how do they expect me to make their law firm business a ""custom logo"" that would take at least 10 hours including research, excluding waiting for feedback, for 10$.   


Upwork clients, friends, aren't looking for ""professional"". There are good clients on the platform but most aren't.

Welcome to Upwork!"
Upwork,fdk999d,t1_fdi2uqu,1578498965.0,"A global market implies free access to ... ""a global market"", Upwork is split into ""US Job market"" and ""Global freemarket"".   


It's not the same as real world capitalism, it's designed and implemented with built in filters that ensure a US Freelancer can make a livable wage on Upwork by having access to US jobs.   
The client can target US freelancers or target the ""global job freemarket"" - to which the US Freelancer can also apply, but the competition becomes tougher (3$/h, you know the story).   


If Pakistan, India, would have access to the US job market, which in average has higher paying jobs because the payment expectation is higher, since living costs are higher on AVERAGE (I've seen US jobs, the same lowballing moneybags there as everywhere) - cue in identity fraud ... you see, Upwork created this mess by splitting the job market.   


I wrote this comment because you are PERFECTLY CORRECT! If Upwork didn't split the job market, US Freelancers, needing a higher wage per hour, would've left the platform long ago."
Upwork,fdk8brl,t3_eli9cn,1578498374.0,"What you must understand is how Upwork 'works'.   


There are 2 job markets, the concept of ""free global market"" is skewed by Upwork.   
[https://imgur.com/IHKMWBN](https://imgur.com/IHKMWBN) The job market as implemented by Upwork is split into US job market and Other ('global job market').   


If you have a look through here  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free\_market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market) , "" a system in which the prices for goods and services are self-regulated by the [open market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_market) and by [consumers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer) "", in this case the consumers are the platform users, both clients and freelancers.   


I've seen the US job market, it's not better than the Global, BUT the US job market comes with the presumption that US freelancers work based on the concept of minimum wage  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum\_wage\_in\_the\_United\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States) , minimum wage as I understand it, is used for UNSKILLED LABOR, yet clients hiring on the platform EXPECT to pay someone for SKILLED LABOR.   


Common sense would dictate that there is a higher wage entry point in hiring a US Freelancer. In my opinion that's why it is structured into two job markets.   


If freelancers working in the 'Global job market' would have access to the US job market (it pains me to say this since I've seen how lowballing US job markets are as well ... ) it would be worse for a US freelancer, they can't compete against India, Pakistan workers, happy to take 3$ an hour. It would leave US Freelancers (Upwork is based in the US, without food on the table, it's not about how good one is, it's money.   
If the client can pay as little as possible while getting something, they might be happy with just that, US freelancers be damned!)  


Only US Freelancers have access to both US jobs and 'Global freemarket jobs', the reason I use quotations is, as you can tell, the platform is split.  


I know there are marginal exceptions, as are given in the comments on this thread, yet, USUALLY, if a client has an hourly wage of minimum, it can be deduced with somewhat certainty that:   
\- the client posted the job for US freelancers, few applied;   
\- the client complains on the Upwork forums about how freelancers (targeting US Freelancers) aren't applying to the job;  
\- the client reposts the job on the 'Global job freemarket ' targeting freelancers outside the US;   


Here's an issue that is obvious: the client is Western world based, the client wants to hire a copywriter, to write good copy (ads, pitches), one would need to understand the mentality of the consumer by being a consumer themselves, in the targeted geographical location (if the ad is for the US, makes sense you'd hire a US freelancer, what would a Ukrainian know about American culture and current socio-political events? They don't live there).   


This case is clear, you need a copywriter for America, you hire American, you want to hire American, it costs more BUT it comes with all the benefits such as the copywriter understanding the consumer mindset that the advertisement targets.   


And I get to this (point/conclusion):  [https://imgur.com/Bh5vJuM](https://imgur.com/Bh5vJuM)  When I bitch on here that a big chunk of Upwork clients lack common sense let alone have the business skills and/or mindset to successfully run a business, and I call them money bags (a nicer alternative to idiots with money), from my bad or good 'overview', it's perfectly justified.   


Based on this, with the exception mentioned in this thread by other freelancers, I can safely assume that a low, 3$/h paying client is not seeking value but volume.  
Don't bother.   


The ""I converted a low paying client, because I'm skilled and do things faster, it comes down to the same amount AND FASTER"", YES it is the definition of SKILLED LABOR. The psychological effect is that, 10 minutes = work done for 3$, 60 minutes = 18$ an hour.   


People latch onto the lower price, if they understood that for 18$ an hour they'd get more done, they would hire the ""more expensive freelancer"".   
It can't be generalized, applied only case by case.   
You see, when marketing people come up with those supermarket prices, it's based on human biases and it exploits that. Upwork is like a thoughtless supermarket in which clients ""buy"" freelancer's time, but the supermarket owner has zero clue how to maximize profit, beyond avoiding devastating action that would destroy the supermarket (such as allowing the ""freemarket freelancer"" that work for pennies, access to US Jobs, it would destroy any chance a US Freelancer could make a livable wage through Upwork)."

Edit no 2. best to download the image, chrome seems to fully zoom when viewing in the browser.

It's a psychological gimmick; people pay more attention to what they might lose than what they would gain.

It forces ""self-regulation"", even top earners on the platform aren't spared from this \[mostly due to blind sight through ignorance/arrogance, confirmation bias ""I made 100 k this year, therefore I am good"" while ignoring important factors such as:+ US clients tend to prefer US freelancers (it's US market vs Rest of the World - imagine if it was any different, letting the 5$ freelancers take US jobs, US freelancers would leave UpWork as if it was a dumpster fire; apparent worth of work vs payment, it's not something imaginary, and that's why UpWork does this. You can usually spot a ""full of shit UpWork guru"" based on this. Then they'll spin the ""but bruh, I made 100k last year"", while ignoring taxation, because the split exists, they're exercising their skills in a better gated platform (there are tons of shitty US clients as well with low budgets, but also more clients with high budgets);

To expand on this idea a bit. If you're a US freelancer on Upwork, this situation comes with foresight on the CLIENT'S PART, ""oh I know what sort of rates should/could apply for this"" since 7-8-9$ an hour as a minimum or more is not unheard of in the US, there's no ""This Indian/Paki/Balkan zone freelancer will work for pennies cause I dunno how much they make there, they're probably happy getting those cents"". The expectation is capped into a bracket of what's expected with a ""minimum"" going on minimum wage in the US.

On US jobs the client (IF she/he has any common sense) the starting rates are ""known"", it's not impossible to pitch to a US client by a US freelancer a rate of 25$ an hour (considering there are states in the US where unskilled labor goes for 10$ an hour, or more, or less).Now switch to the ""global market"", a US client might or might not offer the same pay rate or see the same rate as acceptable. And this builds up to an observation: If a US client posts a job on the ""global market"" they're looking for cheaper rates than US freelancers accept (common sense, they'd look for US freelancers otherwise, but those are beyond the client's budget), more shit jobs exit the gated ""US only"" part of the platform and end up on the global market. Trash jobs for US Freelancers that Indians, Pakistanis, etc would happily take. In this regard, this practice acts only to enforce a ""cleaner, higher standard of pay for US jobs"" - not a given, I repeat myself, lots of low paying, unrealistic budget clients on the US side as well.

Since the market unfolds in this way, it's not impossible for a US freelancer to claim having made 100 000 USD last year, out of which they pay in taxes down to 72 000 perhaps 65 000 USD (net value in their pocket).

Well you see, after taxes, they end up making middle of the road salaries for their professional fields.

It impresses an Indian that can't even imagine what 20 000 USD looks like let alone 65 000 or 100 000 (without considering taxes paid). They're bragging, they're making the platform seem better than it is, while ignoring how the taxation system works in the US, what their net income is, it creates a mask, an image of success that you can sell potential clients on. The bullshit part in this, is they know very well what they're doing, cause in the US if you don't pay your taxes, the government is gonna come after you to collect.

It's interesting (to me at least) to dissect these bullshitters and the flawed handling of their own ""success"". This is where the smug superiority comes from as well, from people like ... (I saw she's trying to become a better person, won't name her), ""we, americans, vs them, the third worlders"", while ignoring the context of how the platform is designed to filter out moronically cheap clients and ejects them on the ""global market"" (it is true! reconsider the US UpWork vs World Market Upwork split of the platform). They also ignore the fact they're not making millions despite their ""obviously better skills, and being better businessmen and businesswomen"" and being stuck in a mediocre salary for their respective fields of specialty."
