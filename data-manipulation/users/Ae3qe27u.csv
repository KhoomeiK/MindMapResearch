AmItheAsshole,ffcszlp,t1_ffblxw2,1579806640.0,"That's fair. I looked it up, and the exams are taken by kids 14-16 years old, maybe 15-17 if they're on the old side for their grade.

I just see a kid who was honest, didn't think about it that much beyond ""can't really lie to her, might as well go for it,"" and is trying to figure out what to do in life.

Honestly? I probably would have said something similar. Something like ""huh, I got mine in a little bit ago. Maybe the post is late on your side?"" Straight changing the topic would be too suspicious and wouldn't work. Agreeing with the mom that all results are late would be lying and misleading. It'd just dig a bigger hole, too. I just don't really see what anyone thinks OP should've said. I just see people attacking her for being a snitch.

She didn't go ""oh, [friend] is hiding the results from you"" or anything like that. She just said that she had gotten her results and that the certificates were out.

Honestly, I don't see what else OP could have said that wouldn't have had the sub railing against her even more."

That seems cruel and out of nowhere. Why would the mom think OP is mean? The kids are 14-16 years old. Where did any of that come from? 

Maybe the mom brought it up *because* she knows OP is honest. Maybe the mom trusts OP. Maybe the mom knows OP is a close friend of her child. Maybe the mom honestly didn't know and just thought the grades were coming in late.

We don't have enough information to make assumptions about what people think of OP's character."
AmItheAsshole,ffcrqpn,t1_ffaer6r,1579805902.0,"How would you?

I say I see no signs of abuse because OP didn't mention anything that indicates an abusive situation. I see it as that the friend is embarrassed about their grades. Maybe their mom told them they'd get grounded unless they brought their grades up. Maybe not.

But the friend hid their grades and is giving OP the cold shoulder. That's it, really. OP didn't say anything about past behavior (besides a habit of lying) or that the mom has ever acted out of bounds.

It seems likely to me that the friend is just an everyday kid who didn't want to admit that they got a few bad grades. They don't seem scared or anything, else they would've told OP not to say anything. Since they didn't, it seems like they didn't care that much about keeping it a secret. They cared some, of course, but they weren't *scared* about it."
TrueOffMyChest,ffcquub,t1_ff97gzj,1579805355.0,"Gender in English is very tied to male/female, but it used to be a more general word for ""type of thing."" So you could have multiple genders of words without having it tied to biological sex.

It became tied to male/female in the 40s/50s when some teachers got tired of children giggling when they talked about male sex vs female sex. They started saying male gender and female gender instead. These days, ""sex"" is often more associated with the act.

German has three genders of words: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Spanish has two: masculine and feminine.

It's called gender because it's a type of word. That's what gender means, really - a type of thing. I hope that makes sense!"

AmItheAsshole,ffaei1p,t3_es9out,1579733763.0,"Going to break the mold here a bit. NAH, imo.

So your friend hid their grades. Okay. Their mom was going to find out one way or the other, and I'd say it's better for her to know now instead of later. The truth was going to come out eventually.

I think bringing it up with your friend first would've been a bit more considerate, but you didn't really have an option in the way the conversation went. The topic came up, and you didn't paint a target on your friend's back. You didn't point fingers, just said that the grades had already come out. She may have just looked them up online.

Your friend is upset because they wanted to get away with it, but it really wouldn't have lasted forever.

You did nothing wrong."
AmItheAsshole,ffae37f,t1_ffad3fc,1579733436.0,"Personally, I'd say it's that's the use of certain words shows a complete lack of respect (and often a certain disdain for) a segment of the population. The word itself isn't the issue - it's the past and history associated with it. It's also the fact that the word itself is often an insult.

It isn't the best comparison, but most people on Reddit would be offended if I called them an incel. They'd also probably be offended if I started insulting their parents/loved ones.

They don't have to be offended by those words, but many insults are seen as an attack upon one's character. Many people are also uncomfortable when people talk behind other's backs, especially if they're insulting or deriding them in private. That makes many people uncomfortable. It's a reaction to an awkward position."

I just don't eat them, and that's okay. They aren't healthy and don't really do anything except give me a dopamine hit. I don't really enjoy them. I just like the rush of dopamine. They don't leave me satisfied or content, either.

Cutting unhealthy stuff out of your diet is totally manageable, but only when you're consistent about it. One exception every few months won't kill you, but getting into the mindset of ""well, only this once, it's fine..."" can and will kill a diet."

A study from 2005 - ""Factors influencing variation in basal metabolic rate include fat-free mass, fat mass, age, and circulating thyroxine but not sex, circulating leptin, or triiodothyronine"". *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.* doi:10.1093/ajcn/82.5.941. [Wikipedia has  a short reference to it](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate#Causes_of_individual_differences_in_BMR), though it does look like I misremembered the number. (2499-1027)*.267 = 393 calories that aren't accounted for by other factors. If you don't account for age, it rises to 418 calories.

[This guy reviews a couple articles](https://examine.com/nutrition/does-metabolism-vary-between-two-people/), though he uses 2000kcal as the resting metabolic rate instead for his first example. It also doesn't account for weight, which would contribute some to how much energy is needed to maintain. The rest is alright. I'm mostly nitpicking

AskReddit,feawqj6,t1_feajrig,1578952975.0,"Where did that come into anything?

Instincts aren't necessarily rational. Even if someone doesn't want kids, it's okay if they aren't attracted. Sometimes, the knowledge of surgeries, history, past experience, and the rest of the whole that comes part and parcel with being trans just throws people off.

And that's okay. People should not be shamed for their sexuality."
AskReddit,feawi4p,t1_feasl67,1578952903.0,"Not for meeting someone, but for intimacy. The closest direct analogy would be catfishing, though that isn't the best comparison.

I have a fairly narrow scope of romantic attraction. As it is, women and trans men do not fall into that category. Some people aren't attracted to certain hair or eye colors. Some people aren't attracted to trans individuals. That's okay. Nobody should be shamed for their sexuality. 

But I would undergo emotional turmoil if I found out my SO was trans. Romantic/physical/etc attraction would cease almost immediately, and that cessation might be traumatic. I don't know. I haven't been in that specific situation. 

But it's better for all parties involved for full disclosure from the beginning. I don't want to break any hearts, and I certainly don't want mine broken.

Nobody should be shamed for their sexuality, and it's best for the hearts of all involved that it never get too far."
