Then it just goes away on its own. And replaced by better, healthier morals. That last part is important. You have to learn morals and values SOMEWHERE. But that should be literature and film and community and education. Not prescriptive bullshit from clerics. That was the mistake the Soviets made; you can't just tell millions of uneducated peasants that there's just no more church. Because you take the building away and people just improvise. And then when the prohibition ends the shit comes back even harder. Because if there's one thing Christianity thrives on, it's victimhood."
