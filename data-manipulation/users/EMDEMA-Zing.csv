it’s like i have one mentality before i take it as in “i’ll be good with just this dose today” then i eat and the dose disappears and i’m fixating on the next one

but you mention that to your loved ones and they tell you “you’re going in circles” as my initial drug of abuse was benzos when i was 16. i’m 23 now
