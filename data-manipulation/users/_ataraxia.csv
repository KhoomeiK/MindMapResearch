ballpython,ffowarj,t3_euce00,1580082535.0,"here's my bad shed copypasta:

bad sheds are a symptom of dehydration, and the most common cause of dehydration is low humidity. BPs in general need a *minimum* of 60% humidity *at all times*, not just when they're in shed. **some individuals require higher humidity than this minimum recommendation. if your BP is repeatedly having bad sheds at 60%-70%, you need to aim more for 80% as standard practice.**

to fix stuck shed and rehydrate your BP, keep the overall humidity at >80%. you will find some tips for humidity maintenance in our [basic care guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18HBVsPHaip7LfrMuFt96MigRuMUXtrbnCiK79VuQiFk/). if you still need help, we can guide you through it if you fill out our [enclosure critique questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cuE05LxMxn5_86Rp-08XMk7OjPhJiNSvr28gaFNAHlk/). 

in addition to higher humidity, you should also add a humid hide. this is a fully enclosed hide with a solid bottom, like the zoo med 3-in-1 reptile shelter or a plastic food container with an entrance hole added to the lid. line it with a moisture-friendly substrate like sphagnum moss, cypress mulch, or coconut husk/fiber. saturate the substrate with water and gently squeeze out the excess, so it's wet but not soupy. re-saturate the substrate as needed. this hide will allow the snake to ""soak"" in a humid microclimate, which will soften the retained shed and it should come off by itself.

**there is absolutely no need to soak the snake in water or try to manually remove the retained shed. this will cause unnecessary stress and could harm your snake.**

for mild cases [ie, a few patches, only one layer of shed/eye caps], the best thing to do is follow the above steps and leave the snake alone. the stuck shed will come off by itself before or during the next shed.

for more severe cases [ie, multiple layers of skin / eye caps, areas of stuck shed feeling hard and rough like sandpaper, stuck shed tight around the tail tip], if the humid hide and increased overall humidity doesn't lead to *any* progress within a couple of weeks, you can do a towel ""soak"". saturate a towel with lukewarm water [in the 80s F] and lightly wring out the excess water, leaving the towel damp but not dripping. fold it in half and place the snake between the two halves, like a little snake sandwich. let them sit there for 20-30 minutes, then gently encourage them to move around in the towel. the water will soften the stuck shed, then the texture of the towel may help it come off. this ""soak"" should be done a few times a week until the shed loosens or the snake goes through another shed. if the snake goes through another shed cycle and still has stuck shed / retained eye caps, or if you see signs of inflammation/infection in those areas, seek assistance from a reptile vet. 

depending on the severity of the dehydration, it might take a few shed cycles before you get a clean one-piece shed. dehydration is a long-term problem both to develop and to resolve. just maintain the high humidity and humid hide until everything is going smoothly."

- bathing him twice a week. did nothing but make him more miserable because he hates baths.
- OTC medications [benadryl, claritin, etc]. did nothing.
- management. we only walked him on pavement and spent more time playing indoors. reduced the itching, but made him completely miserable.

then i asked our vet about prescription medications.

- apoquel. worked great at the initial ""get the current symptoms under control"" twice-daily dose, but did not work for him at all at the once-daily dose. the vet did not recommend keeping him on a twice-daily dose long-term.

ballpython,ffe2455,t1_ffe1krw,1579834708.0,"i would still follow the commonly recommended routine for acclimating the snake to their new home - no handling until they have accepted at least two meals in a row. no matter how old a snake is or how used to being handled they are, moving to a new home with new people and a new enclosure is still going to be stressful to some degree."
ballpython,ffe1yz4,t3_et0xvy,1579834601.0,"so, that's a good price for that type and size of enclosure. however, i wouldn't call it a great long-term investment for a BP, since you'll need to upgrade before the snake is fully grown. a 48""x24"" footprint is the minimum i would recommend for an adult BP.

for heating this type of enclosure, you need to use heat sources that are mounted on the ceiling. radiant heat panels are popular. heat lamps can also he used, but not the dome type you might use on top of a tank; you need a ceiling-mounted socket with a safety guard/cage around it. for heat lamp bulbs, a deep heat projector will provide better heat, but a ceramic heat emitter is also a suitable option. we have some links for all of these items in our [shopping list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vugrtVdwACKh1Y5KKMC9ENI6gWRy03g4bly9-gaD3bY/).

responsible and reputable mean the same thing here. there is no responsible breeder producing cav/pom mixes.

the cost of a puppy is very much a ""you get what you pay for"" issue. a puppy from a backyard breeder or puppy mill is likely to be much more expensive in the long run than a puppy from a reputable breeder. sure, you might pay less for the actual purchase price of the puppy, but you're buying a poorly bred puppy from poorly bred parents, and you're more likely to be dealing with genetic health issues and/or behavioral issues. you would also be supporting unethical breeders and allowing them to continue the cycle of poorly bred dogs, which is not good."

ballpython,ff6injq,t3_erxzfg,1579628015.0,"here's my bad shed copypasta:

bad sheds are a symptom of dehydration, and the most common cause of dehydration is low humidity. BPs in general need a *minimum* of 60% humidity *at all times*, not just when they're in shed. **some individuals require higher humidity than this minimum recommendation. if your BP is repeatedly having bad sheds at 60%-70%, you need to aim more for 80% as standard practice.**

to fix stuck shed and rehydrate your BP, keep the overall humidity at >80%. you will find some tips for humidity maintenance in our [basic care guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18HBVsPHaip7LfrMuFt96MigRuMUXtrbnCiK79VuQiFk/). if you still need help, we can guide you through it if you fill out our [enclosure critique questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cuE05LxMxn5_86Rp-08XMk7OjPhJiNSvr28gaFNAHlk/). 

in addition to higher humidity, you should also add a humid hide. this is a fully enclosed hide with a solid bottom, like the zoo med 3-in-1 reptile shelter or a plastic food container with an entrance hole added to the lid. line it with a moisture-friendly substrate like sphagnum moss, cypress mulch, or coconut husk/fiber. saturate the substrate with water and gently squeeze out the excess, so it's wet but not soupy. re-saturate the substrate as needed. this hide will allow the snake to ""soak"" in a humid microclimate, which will soften the retained shed and it should come off by itself.

**there is absolutely no need to soak the snake in water or try to manually remove the retained shed. this will cause unnecessary stress and could harm your snake.**

for mild cases [ie, a few patches, only one layer of shed/eye caps], the best thing to do is follow the above steps and leave the snake alone. the stuck shed will come off by itself before or during the next shed.

for more severe cases [ie, multiple layers of skin / eye caps, areas of stuck shed feeling hard and rough like sandpaper, stuck shed tight around the tail tip], if the humid hide and increased overall humidity doesn't lead to *any* progress within a couple of weeks, you can do a towel ""soak"". saturate a towel with lukewarm water [in the 80s F] and lightly wring out the excess water, leaving the towel damp but not dripping. fold it in half and place the snake between the two halves, like a little snake sandwich. let them sit there for 20-30 minutes, then gently encourage them to move around in the towel. the water will soften the stuck shed, then the texture of the towel may help it come off. this ""soak"" should be done a few times a week until the shed loosens or the snake goes through another shed. if the snake goes through another shed cycle and still has stuck shed / retained eye caps, or if you see signs of inflammation/infection in those areas, seek assistance from a reptile vet. 

depending on the severity of the dehydration, it might take a few shed cycles before you get a clean one-piece shed. dehydration is a long-term problem both to develop and to resolve. just maintain the high humidity and humid hide until everything is going smoothly."
