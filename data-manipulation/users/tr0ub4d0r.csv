politics,ffdfp40,t1_ffdbqsu,1579819907.0,"I think that part of the elitism of the American political culture (the phrase “American exceptionalism” is absolutely used without irony) is a sense of “it can’t happen here.”  That’s not new; there’s literally a book from the early 1940s with that title, about how fascism couldn’t happen here.  So the slow slide towards dystopia hasn’t registered with most people.  In other words, if you say “this isn’t really a democracy anymore,” people look at you like you’re trying to stir shit up.

But it’s true.  Aside from the popular vote, which Democrats have won in six of the past seven presidential elections (and been denied the win in two of those elections), Democrats routinely win more votes for House, Senate, etc. and still come up with the minority and less power.

One thing Republicans are really, really good at is using the levers of government to obtain more power for themselves.  My “favorite” trick they’ve recently started adopting is that, in states with Republican-dominated legislatures, they routinely pass new laws stripping the governor of powers immediately before a Democrat takes office, and then restoring those powers immediately before a Republican takes over.  (They’ve done this in Wisconsin and North Carolina, among others.)

It’s baldly partisan and anti-democratic, but one thing Republicans have also noticed is that they never really face any penalty for it.  So until they do, this will continue.  If you’ve got any better ideas for how to fight back, I’d really love to hear it, but we’re doing the best we can."

You have to understand the special place Star Wars used to hold in the pop-culture universe.  Until the mid-90s, all three movies were among the highest-grossing movies ever, and they were all absolutely beloved and treasured in a way that smash hits like Avatar or Dr. Zhivago or movies like that often aren’t.

And there just wasn’t that much of it.  With Avengers you have the comics and the 21 prior movies.  With Harry Potter you had the 7 earlier movies and the books that had more or less the same plot.  With Star Wars you had the Expanded Universe, which was great for the obsessed, but nothing that spoke to the main series.  The idea of a new Star Wars movie was like this mythic idea that we hoped would happen, maybe, someday.  The rereleases of the movies in the mid-90s were themselves big hits.  People—I did this myself—waited for hours outside the theater to see movies that everyone already had on video, just to see them in a movie theater with a bunch of friends.  I still remember The English Patient came out that weekend too, and we were making fun of it (what a terrible-sounding title for teenage ears, honestly), until we realized the couple in front of us in line was actually there to see it.  The guy turns around and we’re all like, oh shit, and he goes, “you know, I still remember waiting hours in line for Star Wars when it first came out, and I’m really glad to see that you guys are still doing it.”  Obsession with Star Wars literally brought generations together.

It was just insane when Phantom Menace came out.  What I remember most are the normally reserved newspapers and publications devoting covers to the return of Star Wars.  When I saw it, the audience cheered when “STAR WARS” appeared on the screen, and then the audience cheered *again* when “Episode I - THE PHANTOM MENACE” started the crawl.  People legitimately couldn’t believe that there was a new Star Wars movie.

We all cheered when it ended, too.  It was so hotly anticipated that there was a real Emperor’s New Clothes situation where no one wanted to admit it wasn’t that good.  We just felt lucky to have it."

AskReddit,feax3qv,t3_eo6l00,1578953097.0,"I was giving a graduation speech with a friend of mine.  The new principal insisted on seeing our drafts (which itself I think is a little inappropriate, but whatever) and completely lost her shit at our earliest draft.  We didn't have anything bad, just pretty informal; I remember the first thing that set her off is that I started off my section by saying ""What up, [name]"" to my friend. Real aggressive, edgy stuff.

So we were pretty pissed, and we decided to get revenge by drafting two speeches: a dumb, boring one we'd discuss with the principal, and the real one we'd actually give.  The early drafts of the real one were pretty harsh, along the lines of ""the administration's holding us back and we're so oppressed."" But as we worked on it, I realized that our school nickname, the Rebels, would fit in nicely to our theme about how our class is a bunch of rebels who are going to go out in the world and do things our way, regardless of what we're told.  Nothing even mentioning the administration, just subtext for people who knew what was going on.  Overall a completely positive speech.

I have never been so nervous in my life as when I started this speech.  The principal was sitting right in front of us, and I kept thinking about not getting my diploma, not getting into college, yadda yadda.  We give the speech (which by that point was pretty good) and avoid eye contact with the principal for the rest of the ceremony.

Think these things through now so you don’t have to while you’re in middle of labor and all drugged up. 

Also, no one does this, but try to read about how to raise a newborn. I really, really recommend Moms On Call if you can find it. We followed their sleep instructions and had our first sleeping through the. Isn’t at 5-6 weeks. Others I know have had similar success with that book.
