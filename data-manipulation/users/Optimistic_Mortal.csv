nihilism,fcbheds,t3_egzfiz,1577586893.0,"I feel you, these things like work and working out,  never interested me they are just time passers. But I do know I need a sense of connection, sex or understanding. I also know that working and working out impress other people therefore making potential for connections more frequent. I would recommend the philosophy of Taoism its about just ""flowing"" with what apparently is a series of events in your life that you seem to know what to do in without much thought but just action. For me this was neccessary to have a conversation when I feel like we should just skip all dialogue because shit is pointless and get to the sex or the part where you validate how I feel. Good luck."

nihilism,fc64x0e,t1_fc640zi,1577472351.0,"Well Christianity speaks of heaven, and if you live your life according to their commandments, once you die you go to heaven, a motivating promise for me to act noble. I just need to be belive in it, faith. Thats in my opinion the only way to change perspective.
As for the freedom found in nihilism is the realization that doing ""bad"" things is not punished by a god, you simply do bad things and deal with the consequences. If there is any. So the ability to be violent and serious lied behind nihilism, for me atleast and I needed those 2 things in my life."
