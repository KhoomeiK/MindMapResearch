Seriously, it's not going to be easy, this is hard, but it sounds like you're tough and I bet you've done sooner tough things before, you just focus on each day at a time! You can choose how your life will go! Surround yourself with support, positivity, and reminders of what you DO want in life! You got this!!! (/r/getdisciplined is good)"

pregnant,ff9q6hd,t3_escm97,1579718508.0,"So I felt the same, but when we got pregnant I wanted to wait till the baby was born to find out gender, my husband wanted to know, so a small party with close friends was a really fun compromise! We combined it with his birthday, and that made them both more special, it ended up being a great bonding time with friends and family who were so happy for us!"

physicaltherapy,ff4741m,t3_ergozq,1579556988.0,"I prefer to work acute care for this reason, I am one on one for whatever time that patient needs, then I move on, prioritizing as I go. You're still trying very hard to maximize efficiency and document in the room, etc, and I love the challenge of complex diagnoses and the ICU, rehab is also a fun setting that's fast paced, some group, but also can be a great challenge in a really rewarding way! All settings can be crazy and you have to maximize your efficiency, but all the settings are VERY different, and I would definitely wait till you experience then all before you decide, but you use what you learn in each setting wherever you good so lean on your CI, learn a lot and try to enjoy drinking from the firehose!!"
pregnant,ff465bw,t3_erh3p3,1579556389.0,Yay!! Congratulations!!
pregnant,ff41t7v,t1_ff3q1c4,1579553692.0,"Yes, this is what I do, yogurt daily, oatmeal w/Chia seeds and blueberries, snack on veggies/fruit, and veggies at all meals, minimize dairy and lots of water! And dried plums/prunes, dates, and beans here and there, i may only have a day here and there I don't poop, but yes, definitely slowly introduce fiber if you're not used to it! Good luck to us all!!"
physicaltherapy,ff1t7cl,t1_fewn8s4,1579485637.0,"It provides weight bearing in UE which if tone is high can increase the proprioceptive feedback, increase actual strength, you can go into some great stretches from it, and thus decrease tone. Also while there there’s lots of neuro techniques you can do to increase activation, coordination, decrease (or increase) tone in the trunk, and then the LE are in optimal position to start working on hip extensors, also they are in great weight bearing and in a way that can be easier and safer for people that aren’t yet ambulatory. You can start working on synergies for pre-gait, PNF things, it’s great set-up for working on core activation. So it’s a great thing in itself, and then once it’s easy there’s LOTS of great things you can do from there. So it’s a useful tool to use sometimes towards different goals."

VA explains things for me, I'm a physical therapist and more used to Medicare/Medicaid, people with no insurance, bad insurance, etc, Thank you so much for your service! I can't tell you how grateful I am for veterans like you. I'm really glad you were able to get the prosthetics you needed! I'm glad to know the VA is taking care of veterns. 

I really hope we can elect some officials supporting universal health care so everyone can also get the supplies and support they need like you so I can stop volunteering at free clinics, helping with fund raisers, training people how to function who are getting a charity wheelchair much less a prosthetic, etc etc etc. Breaks my heart and I hope everyone votes in their primaries and elections!"

TwoXChromosomes,fdoka0d,t1_fdnvjnw,1578606849.0,"Haha!! Oh love, I was all up in the tinder, plenty of fish and god knows what other apps! I'm talking from experience, I met my spouse on Match.com using above criteria about a year ago, and when I was with friends or in bars I assessed guys the same. I'm saying good women/girls are looking for good guys/men or other good women. Finding a good, mature, healthy relationship is the same no matter your age. Being emotionally whole and loving yourself, that's not a fairy tale, it's beautiful and real."
pregnant,fdoipd1,t1_fdn4wg4,1578605944.0,"Exactly! Well said. You have a right to your feelings and emotions, pregnant or not, everyone deserves respect and to be heard."
TwoXChromosomes,fdnunca,t1_fdnmnmx,1578593183.0,"Not the guys I had some great conversations with about life, etc, who were strong because they could talk about how they felt with compassion for others and themselves, had lots of interests and invested in themselves because how can you love someone else if you don't take care of/love yourself first? those guys you call back!"

OldSchoolCool,fdnsm26,t1_fdnqhrj,1578592006.0,"Depends how's long of a time period you're taking about, when I was first diagnosed with depression/anxiety 17 years ago, I didn't tell one soul, I might have lost my career, dating would not have occurred, etc. Now everyone in my life knows who needs to, family, work, friends. There's better medication, research, I see other friends and I can post about it, there's great books. It's coming along, but at least now you can talk about it and there's so much help! People talk about it on TV, internet, I love it and try to do my part to be vocal so I can help reduce the stigma even more!"

NRelationships,fcb48nl,t3_egx2z3,1577582145.0,"I think it’s getting distance from unhealthy people so you can fill yourself, your time, your mind with healthy inputs so you can heal and mature. I think it’s about creating healthy friendships, continue meditation and working with a counselor. Only give time, energy, emotion to people you trust and it seems you cannot trust them. Focus on yourself and self care! When you are healed and have more distance and experiences then you can go back to them and attempt to heal relationships."

NRelationships,fc5snlc,t3_eg8f1f,1577464976.0,"Just because you guys had sex on the first date doesn't mean anything, a couple hours is completely normal to not hear back. Dating sucks! It sucked because your heart is in the line and it's hard to be patient. But, who you are as a person is not affected by any outcome that might happen! So stay true to your gut (not your anxiety) and if you really want a long term relationship then just the next time you guys talk  lean into some courage and tell him honestly where you're coming from. If you can't relax and tell him and ask for what you need in a mature way, then maybe this isn't the guy anyway and maybe not the right time anyway. And if he doesn't give you an honest open answer back or or if he doesn't feel you what you want to hear, then that's your answer and now you can move on, be sad for awhile, then you can keep rocking on being your awesome self because you deserve a open honest and trusting relationship!
