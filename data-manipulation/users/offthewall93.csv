That river is what makes California productive and we’re right at the headwaters. Also, we have our own dam and reservoir which makes a world of difference. It’s funny because you could never build a personal dam here now but it’s so clutch as part of our carbon neutral efforts. By the time you get to Stockton about 200 miles south it’s all pumps, all the time. The land is so heavily overworked there it’s terrifying.

whatisthisthing,fcud50l,t1_fcu3rcx,1577978166.0,"It’s worth noting though, that I’m at he very northern end of California. Despite being a ridiculous agricultural state, there’s much less than average at the north end because it’s so mountainous. That basically rules out custom farming, which my dad and I have tried in the past. Also, our infrastructure is old and unique. We have two bridges over creeks that are both upwards of 60 feet long. That’s about $200,000 to replace and one is overdue. Also, the waterworks are due and that’s about $500,000. We haven’t quite bought all the land back after my grandpas divorce, $1M. Plus we’re in California so our costs are truly outrageous in general. Truly, the previous generations have left a mess for me to fix."

We’re actually completely water and energy self-sufficient here, as we have an above-grade reservoir of about ten hectares which gravity feeds an entire subterranean waterworks my grandpa built.

whatisthisthing,fcso09d,t1_fcsmvs9,1577920772.0,"Yeah I mean I run 400 acres but after several generations, including their divorces and money issues we’re down pretty far in what we actually own. The bank owns some, the neighbors own some and we lease it back, etc. My preceding generations really wasted a valuable resource: uninterrupted, arable land in the hands of one family. Also, I feel it important to note that none of my tractors even have a cab, let alone GPS and HVAC. We just sit in the sun ( and it can break 110F here pretty frequently) and dust and die young. After the Western US droughts of the past decade, we had lost almost everything. It’s hard on a man’s soul to know there are farms with all this going for them but know that even if I absolutely kill it, maybe my children could afford ONE piece of equipment like that and MAYBE we could buy all the land back someday."

whatisthisthing,fcsld52,t1_fcsl1vs,1577918968.0,"My wife and I just went to visit her family in Switzerland and I was in shock. Some locals told us equipment is heavily subsidized, that way no one person gets an undo advantage over the others. In that way, it encourages small, local operations. It was probably the best use of a relatively small amount of tax dollars I've ever seen and it made me really envious. That said, it's a country with a population of 4 million, a per capita GDP of like $65k USD, is the size of some US counties and ridiculously strict immigration... it's not an apples to apples comparison."
whatisthisthing,fcsksiz,t1_fcsjqty,1577918599.0,"Yeah it should be mentioned that everyone in my family has a college degree and solid jobs off the farm, almost all of them in STEM fields. Our size of operation just isn’t that efficient that it can totally support itself. One bad year would sink us without external cash flows. I didn’t mean for us to return to small farms like the bad old days, per se, but it would be nice if suppliers and manufacturers would pay us some attention at all. Too many of us relatively small farms are being pushed out of business simply because we can’t afford a $400k tractor to replace the one we bought for $10k."
