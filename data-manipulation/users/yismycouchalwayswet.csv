Remember any behavior born of jealously is transparently insecure and will immediately make you loose face and power. Girls are funny.

That's been very damaging to millenials. If a woman says she's not interested and just wants to be friends. She legit just wants to be friends and will not change her mind. If she's engaged or says no back the fuck off. IRL its weird and creepy to play the long game in the friendzone (especially if you put that on her when she was very clear) or try to steal someone's fiance. The one exception is if you look like John Krasinsky and your trying to land jenna fisher.

The only people in IB are people who's parents care about them being in IB which means you were probably forced to do that by parents ensuring future wealth. My guess Asian or Eastern european.

WitchesVsPatriarchy,fdvvb3c,t1_fdvnbd8,1578751888.0,"My quality of life drastically improved. You're right i am proud it was super empowering. Do you understand how satisfying it is to have something ruin your life day in and day out and then getting to just shoot and kill it and then sweet blissful peace and quiet ensues. Problem solved. Literally i wish all problem solving was that satisfying stress relieving and permanent. Plus do you understand how difficult it is to kill a magpie with an arm sling sling shot, especially after they figure out you have something to shoot at them with. Its hard the time it takes to get into position they're gone man. Right there's wind factor the parabola effect and you need good aim it takes practice. You guys are acting like i just took a gattling gun to the coulie. They are categorized as a PEST. We have no other birds in this city cause of the dominant and aggressive magpies. I honestly feel like i did a service to the community."

Keeping him in is abuse towards this particular cat. Some can be happy inside mine cant. He looks identical to a wild cat. Im not taking away wind and sun and grass and roaming from him.

unpopularopinion,fdvpaht,t1_fdvfl6i,1578749999.0,"Yeah that's nuts. But why would kids K-9 have  no free time simply cause its been 20 years. Since i was that age, here in canada they havent like added 3 hours to the school day. Plus i sat on the bus 1.25 hours twice a day and i still had time to go playing id actually walk dogs cause i couldnt have one and thats all i ever wanted. Its only stressful cause kids just eat chips on their tablet and parents have to sit next to them and basically do the homework for them. Tell your kid ""do 30 minutes of homework per night m-f and weekends off"" if you have more dont do it. I seriously doubt thats not going to make a substantial dent in the total homework load. The only reason this is a problem nowadays is cause parents have to take the half hour out of their evening every night to make sure it gets done cause of their coddled kids who never learnt responsibility. Tell your kid do your homework or youll repeat 5th grade like a tard. And if they dont well theyll likely get passed anyways and if not maybe round 2 of 5th grade will be different"
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fdvmmfi,t1_fdvkhdv,1578749095.0,He was at first but then he developped feline lower urinary tract disease and got a blocked bladder a few times. Outdoor access makes him much less stressed and he drinks more water and he doesn't get blocked since i let him out. And he has a whole nature area to go to without crossing any roads. I'd never lock him up like a prisoner again. I'm suprised to hear that's upsetting though. I think it's extremely funny. I nearly died when i read your comment. Its not even illegal to kill them. If i took the time to build traps and them kill them that would be 100 percent legal here in canada. The problem is shooting projectile pellets that could injure a child or pet. I thought the only weirdo who gave 2 fucks about the actual magpies was tammy my annoying neighbor.
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fdvix75,t1_fduloow,1578747919.0,"I moved into a basement suite with my cat 3 years ago. The magpies that live in the coulie just beyond the backyard chainlink go absolutely insane the second my cat goes out. In the spring that is, cause they have babies. There's like 15 of them and they will squawk and bully my cat like I'll often come out back to find them messing with him and the noise is unbearable drowns out my tv. And they just got more and more brazen. They wouldn't even leave when i came out just move like a few feet away if i got too close. Anyways i got this arm-sling sling shot and practice all day with my aim. And just went nuts on these birds man. I fully intended to genocide the magpie population in that coulie but my neighbor found a bunch of dead magpies in her backyard and saw me shooting them totally enraged in the coulie early on a saturday morning. So the cops come, my landlord who lives upstairs yells at me and parties over BUT let me tell you the current magpie troop 3 years later know exactly who i am. I kinda feel like a god actually they don't fuck with me no more. I still shoot them just through a window on the dl. God killing them was the sweetest thing ive ever experienced. Wish i could still kill them as brazenly i could do so much more damage but c'est la vie. But yeah they're smart they know my face, they know my car and they thought their young to fear me"
unpopularopinion,fdveh1j,t1_fdvcpvq,1578746595.0,Is the homework load really that bad? I always did all my homework and still had time to play outside 3+ hours on weeknights and all day on weekends. i also never really did homework on weekends. K-9 studying for a test is like 15 - 30 minutes. Plus even if you dont do any of it and fail every test they dont hold you back. So if you dont want your kid to do homework its in your power.

relationships,fdjp874,t3_eln6lo,1578481904.0,"This right here is why I have totally emancipatedq myself from the system. I'm almost always thinking about killing myself. I have personality disorders and extreme depression anxiety. I would never ever ever tell anyone how suicidal i am. My parents were determined i go into a hospital. Determined they take me and 'fix me' for 6 months. They'd call and lie to the police say i was at risk of suicide when i wasnt (ill never actually do it just the 24/7 pain makes me wish for it) but id never say that. Anyways the cops would come and theyll literally tase you to lock you up in a cold padded room with nothing but a paper thin open backed gown. So your basically naked. Cause apparently ill kill myself with my t shirt and jeans and panties. Anyways. Im on my own now. Ive had enough of 'help' where cops barge in and take you to a place where u cant eat and you have nothing to do except think about how badly you wanna die. The system is rough. If that shrink calls the cops they will treat her like a criminal. Literally no difference between ted bundy and a sick 22 year old girl to them. They will tase you and put you behind bars. Id reccomend going along with it. (You might shit yourself from the taser) pretending she has ZERO schizoid stuff going on say ""i said that for attention, i just really needed the attention"" they honestly just assume young girls are like that and just try to convince the doctor that youre not insane. Once your free. Go off the mental health grid as much as possible and uh. Yeah. Try and cope alone. At least the system wont come traumatize you every week as you attempt to cope with your sickness."

relationships,fdjncuv,t3_elfi2g,1578479296.0,Jesus christ the marriages people get themselves into. Like you had kids with this guy? Who marries for a second time at 22. Like even if you have nothing and no one and no education how is renting a room while working min wage worse and harder than marrying and breeding with a narcissist. Girl leave. Like. Im glad your smartening up... its at glacial pace but at least its happening. Plus dont you get like alimony and child support? How is being alone worse than being with this guy. You need to learn serious boundaries and self worth. Leave and then take great care about who you let in your life. You attracted a narcissist once unless you work on yourself you'll attract another. Good luck. The parenting via shaming nip that in the bud aggressively. Being an adult with shame problems is the gateway to a life riddled with mental illness. Also tell your kid that when dad does that its cause hes deranged and fucked and to not listen to him at all. Parents who parent with shame are emotional black holes with no other tools in their parenting tool box. Careful your most sensitive one will get the brunt of it. Make sure they know they're not a POS.

For so long i thought abuse was love, i thought all kinds of inappropriate and abusive things were standard. It's very obvious i never had someone sound to guide me. They think im a monster but i dont care what it costs im not spending another second of my life with that fucking asshole. You sound like you love your brother a lot more than i love mine. Maybe its just cause you're still young and capable of being guilt tripped by your enabling parents. If you choose to have him in your life id suggest drawing a line in the sand.
