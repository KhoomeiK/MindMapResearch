fatlogic,fff7efa,t1_ffe1hxo,1579877591.0,"I get the feeling that a lot of these people have really in some way bought into commercials and stuff about ""lose 30 pounds in 10 days!"" or ""the fat just melts away fast!"" and so they think that a normal, steady weight-loss diet where you measure out sensible portions and maybe go for a run, etc. is disordered and obsessive. Even while they know,and we know, those goofy fad diets and pills don't work, they seem to have this idea that slow and steady doesn't win the race."
fatlogic,ffbti8t,t1_ffajkub,1579782180.0,"Not that anyone on this sub's forgotten, but Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk aren't doing too bad, either."
fatlogic,ffano69,t1_ffaddtm,1579740214.0,"That's pretty shitty of people to say to her. 
I buy my sports bras in the girls' section now because I got so flat chested after losing the weight, but then I'm happy about it. I hated having boobs, LOL"
fatlogic,ff97vs0,t1_ff8hqjj,1579706889.0,"For a bunch of people who're supposedly healthier and happier than every other skinny person on earth, combined, they sure do spend a lot of time at the doctor's. Or specialists' of various stripes."
fatlogic,ff972zv,t1_ff8xqwq,1579706375.0,They're fitphobic.
fatlogic,ff4d4z8,t1_ff3n5jg,1579560796.0,"If I were just a few inches shorter, the length wouldn't even be an issue either. Kind of wondering if I can pass the pants off as capris, LOL."
fatlogic,ff4d1gl,t1_ff3yoxl,1579560733.0,"I totally agree. I happened to actually enjoy running, but some people hate it. But if playing frisbee, soccer, weight lifting, or hiking is fun for you, do that. It's like people think there's one or two exercises, both of which suck, and that's it."
fatlogic,ff4cron,t1_ff3zt69,1579560557.0,"I haven't really looked at the numbered sizes, but I noticed that in more casual things, I can wear larger girl's sizes. For example, an adult man's small t-shirt fits okay, as does a girl's XL. It's just weird. I have no idea how I'm going to buy my next pair of jeans."
fatlogic,ff3kyvq,t1_ff3g1pt,1579543267.0,I have to buy a lot of stuff in kids' clothes now. The clothes from the adult sections fit like tents.
fatlogic,ff2uveq,t1_ff12nn2,1579525082.0,"I'm also convinced it's one of the reasons people seem to think of diet & exercise for weight loss as torture. It just reinforces that mindset and makes people more reluctant to do something that might be unpleasant at first but would have a big positive impact on them, long-term."
CutYourOwnHair,ff0rtd9,t3_er2fzu,1579471696.0,That looks amazing!
fatlogic,fer2ys6,t1_fepynqc,1579349107.0,Can confirm - have run marathons and would definitely do this.
vegan,fempt0b,t3_epztbv,1579266006.0,Meat doesn't have a taste anyway.
HighStrangeness,felcj38,t3_eppusy,1579218971.0,This is not at all terrifying in any way.
fatlogic,fek49du,t1_fek2tg1,1579192284.0,"Some people don't seem to comprehend anyone actually not wanting crappy junk food. Not fighting it, not struggling or unhinged, just not wanting to eat it."
fatlogic,feggwwc,t1_fegg7s0,1579092380.0,"Exactly - grapes are often one of the most expensive things in the produce department, and this person bought two freaking bags of them? Looks more like they tailored their shopping to fit their conclusion, rather than actually seeing what they could get for their money."
fatlogic,feeyw9l,t1_feeq274,1579044263.0,"For all their bluster about loving themselves and ""thin fragility"" FAs come across as the most INsecure bunch of people I've ever run across. Not only insecure but narcissistic as well, and I am not throwing the narc term around lightly. I don't personally care about other people having made different choices than me or having different interests and hobbies - I don't care if they think the things I do are crazy. I just got home from running a marathon, and most people seem to find that an inconceivable thing to do for fun. I simply can't imagine being personally hurt and offended by *everything* around me that varies in any way from the way I think and feel."
fatlogic,feew2hd,t1_feesvqe,1579042453.0,"YES. I lost 90 pounds and needed to carry two 40-pound items, so 80 lbs obv. I did it, but I was thinking the whole time that I used to just carry this with me every day, all the time."
rundisney,feepm23,t3_eopk9k,1579038557.0,"I've done three loads so far, ROFL. Husband and I both did Dopey and we had the dirty laundry to prove it. Even the Roo Pouches got washed."
rundisney,fed9ute,t1_fed9mmo,1579005054.0,Hal Higdon's website now lists a training plan specifically for  Dopey. I've used it and completed three challenges so far.
rundisney,fe9ja95,t1_fe6mr8e,1578938063.0,"Buses were running pretty smoothly out of Art of Animation - I forget when we left exactly, but getting there and back went more or less all right. Same for previous events when we stayed across the pond at Pop. 

One thing I've noticed is that the Pop/Art buses back to hotels from the races are handled by the same people each time. Sergio seems to have this down pat, and I was a little curious as to why he hopped on just before our bus left after the marathon and basically said thanks for being so great, it's been a great weekend, be well. My husband and I were thinking, ""That was really nice - but a bit odd."" Now starting to hear and read some of the screw-ups others dealt with things start making more sense."
rundisney,fe7ap86,t3_eny6fw,1578912153.0,"In 2018 I saw one I still love - ""Dig deep! Like a kid looking for a booger!""
This time around, I saw the lady with the ""End of line - Avatar: Flight of Passage"" one but it was a lot funnier because I saw her in Hollywood Studios.
Of course, by that time I was so tired everything was funny. ;)"
rundisney,fe4u3d6,t3_ensv85,1578862777.0,"Don't know how accurate this is, but I heard there was an issue with runners being dropped off this morning - the bus was lost or just super late or etc. Again, don't know for sure on that one.

I hope the people who got sick from the heat are okay - saw three go down myself. It was brutal out there."
