My history with the game before the tv show made melike Geralt as a character was starting a new game six times and never finishing White Orchard because I didn't feel like some supernatural being who could slice through mobs with ease. I understand and love a challenge; I've played Bloodborne and Dark Souls completely several times, but in certain cases where my character is meant to be slightly overpowered, I want to feel overpowered. It's just how I found out I cannot play Dishonored sans abilities; I am fully capable of beating the game as a ghost without powers, but then it's boring to me."

AskMen,fdnxnwj,t3_elwlva,1578594942.0,"I had recently broken up with my first girlfriend whom had said she loved me in the first week. She had gone on cheated on me with an ex, as I found out not too soon after the breakup. This was astonishing because her college career had been derailed by her being cheated on by her fiance. But that wasn't the issue that made me uncomfortable. 

What made me uncomfortable was talking to a girl whom I found very pretty, kind, and I thought wise. I was divulging everything I'd found out, as a way to understand it all myself, and I mentioned how I asked my ex who she was dating or if she was dating. In my mind, I didn't want to have a friend who was secretly seeing my ex behind my back. The girl I was talking to became uncharacteristically defensive, saying that my ex did not have to do so. In hindsight, I agree--I've grown a bit since then--but then, I did not. A few talks down the road, and I found out she had cheated on her boyfriend from back home.

I honestly think that's what broke the camel's back when it came to me trusting people. This person whom I'd seen as a cool person, who was always nice to people, and was obviously very smart had done this to someone whom she had herself said she loved. She felt remorseful about it, and the guilt had made her year horrible, but she had done it nevertheless. For years, I never felt comfortable trusting anyone, particularly women because of what I found out. 

This may not be the kind of story you want OP, but uncomfortable is the right word I'd use for that conversation."
