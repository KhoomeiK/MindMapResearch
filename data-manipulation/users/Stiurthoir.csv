dankchristianmemes,ffr6x36,t1_ffr5sk8,1580151769.0,"First I want to thank you for inquiring in such a respectful manner.

I do find it challenging to reconcile my view with what's presented in the Bible, but I feel I have to try as I can't find it in me to believe that those who are raised in a different faith and remain in that faith yet still live a life guided by the key Christian values (knowingly or unknowingly) will be condemned.

Because of this I take the notion of faith in Christ in a very non-literal way. Basically I believe that if you have faith in the truth of Christ's teachings, (love your neighbour etc.) that's in a way the same thing as having faith in Christ himself. So you essentially believe in God's message, but you don't think of it as 'God's message' you might think of it as 'right and wrong'.

I know this way of thinking can be very controversial and definitely comes into conflict with parts of the Bible, but its what I've come to accept. It is of course just my opinion, and as you said, everyone is entitled to their own."
