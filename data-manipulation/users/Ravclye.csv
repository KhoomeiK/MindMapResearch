thesims,ff1zqf7,t3_enogtn,1579489990.0,"So I decided to do this... last minute. And I think because of that, and because this is my first ever real build I may have misunderstood how the squares work. If so, this is 25 squares lol, if not its exactly 100 squares. But it is play tested and everything works :) Great for single sims. I kinda doubt a couple would be able to manage, but in theory you could make it work

Even if they somehow fit through the doughnut of truth, or we used zoo sized machines it's pretty much a huge waste of everyones time and money. Fat obscures the picture so much it's about as useful as not doing a scan at all. Even x-rays are not super helpful for the severely obese"

Which by the way once a person goes on permanent dialysis its estimated they have 5 years to live. This doesnt count for those undergoing emergency dialysis after trauma, pretty much exclusively t2 diabetes patients. 

Type 2 is the scariest disease and should be thought of similar to cancer"

And I found that even if I wasnt tracking or trying to lose, after I learned to be hungry it wasnt a big deal in the slightest anymore. It's like riding a bike, you never forget how to handle it.

For OP, personally I love yogurts and also Luna Protien bars. But basically anything higher in fat and protein. The fat free versions usually arent much lower in calories, and wont keep you full as long. Then you can go hog on dinner. Same with large amounts of veggies, just beware of certain ones, usually root veggies. Your best friend will become water though"

houseplants,fdkwy8h,t1_fdkt8sj,1578512866.0,"Part of the issue is the trend of house flipping has removed all the cheaper houses off the markets. They take houses which need some work or arent as appealing, so would make cheaper starting homes, and make them way too expensive for the younger market"

BanPitBulls,fd6lecr,t1_fcpukou,1578192720.0,Few days late but I also had an experiance trying to adopt a kitten. It was a nightmare. Cats are still fairly easy to get from people finding kittens so no need for a breeder there. But if I ever get another dog (strong doubt there) I'm going to a breeder. Shelters have lost their minds
houseplants,fcvaeu8,t3_eizjg4,1577997985.0,"I did this with my school. Like the last day of class I was waiting in a different spot than normal. The building had a large atrium with a few larger plants. But then I saw it. This gorgeous purple trailing plant. Likely some sort of wandering jew. Had to have it.

After my test I went right up and plucked a bit off one of the vines. I figure I pay them more than enough, so I can take some leaves. Some professor was giving me dirty looks the whole time lol.

First time propagating a plant and it's getting quite large now :)"
AskReddit,fbz9b06,t1_fbfsycu,1577239143.0,"People all have very different views on what a small town is depending on the average population density. My town has 50,000 and it's considered small, because I live near NYC. But to someone living in a very rural area a population of 50,000 would be considered a city in it's own right."
