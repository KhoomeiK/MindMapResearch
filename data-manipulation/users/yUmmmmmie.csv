If a package tracking says ""delivered"" then you are 100% covered by eBay AND PayPal as a seller. Every single time. If a package is ""stolen"" then its the fault of the customer (per eBay) and they have the option to file a police report etc. Never allow a refund for ""stolen"" packages - its almost always a person looking for a freebie."
college,fdsah44,t3_emr95v,1578698103.0,"Wow. This is a hard one. First off, I'm sorry to hear this happened and to happen on Christmas. Your feelings right now are 100% valid. 

Your situation is really the reason deferment exists. One year is 12 months. 12 months to grieve, handle the estate, and heal.... a lot of stuff. You deserve to heal. So 12 months is a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things. It's okay to do this. Your not letting anyone down and it's not going anywhere as long as you follow school policy. 

Imagine not deferring, not doing well, being over worked and stressed, depression sets in.. things get worse... and now your GPA is permanently damaged. Its not worth it. 

I say allow yourself to grieve and heal, school can wait. Just tell them and communicate with them and follow their deferment policy.

Edit: I just saw your on GI bill. Thank you for your service."

college,fdnh8vl,t1_fdnftmq,1578585760.0,"So everyones different and definitely ask your doctor before doing anything. In my experience personally with welbutrin I did about 3 months of tapering down or skipping days and if I felt ok I continued down in mg, and I told my doctor although he was wanting me to stay on and fully medicated. Welbutrin can actually make some people more anxious because its peppy. Its tuff because some of the other antianxiety meds are bad news. It also depends I think on the type of anxiety you have. For me I had anxiety and that was causing depression. The depression was making me want to stay home and do nothing. So the welbutrin helped me break thru and get my ducks in order, which helped with the anxiety because I had plans to meet my goals, and the depression dissapeared because life improved. Today I take nothing for anxiety. But some days I can actually feel the anxiety building up in my body and I just know an attack is possible- so I'll take a welbutrin and get focused and feel more in control of my surroundings because I'm not going over every thing in my mind a thousand times. It really depends on your body and situation, like are you experiencing what is referred to as situation anxiety or is it biologically related? Then things get even trickier with adding other meds into the mix. 
Prior to welbutrin I had a lot of success with Zoloft which handled the social anxiety and depression really well, but I was a zombie at the higher doses. But I know people that hate that drug too ... just trust your gut. 

If you dont have depression, and let's say you are not like staying home, avoiding people, closing your self down - then you probably don't need the pep that welbutrin brings to the table - instead opt for something a little less stimulating. But no, I never had withdrawals on it and its effectiveness for me for as needed is my lifeline. Also, it took about a month to become acclimated to the drug properly."
OpiatesRecovery,fdndbd3,t3_em7eyf,1578583357.0,"You are on the right path with Suboxone. Say on it, get a valid prescription. That period DOES pass with time.

&#x200B;

You are so used to your life revolving around a pill it's like you need to relearn normal functions. Once the chase ends you have time to think, and sometimes that's super hard. I would ask about some quick-acting depression meds just to carry you through the worst of it. 80% of that is the body in shock I think, the other 20% are those issues that brought to you the meds in the first place. The addiction doc who prescribes the subs can also prescribe (usually) other meds to keep you psychologically stable. Talk to the addiction specialist MD to get some mild antidepressants onboard to see how that helps - I would not recommend anything that takes time to build up if you are really struggling right now, so like Zoloft would be usually a month to begin feeling a hint of effect. Wellbutrin is a nice all-around anxiety and depression med that I found invaluable during the initial period when I switched from opiates to suboxone. But every persons body chemistry reacts differently and you should look for a perfect fit for you.

&#x200B;

The other part that is also required is some therapy, just talking helps, that way it's out there - someone knows what you're struggling with - and it's not just pent up inside burning a hole. Once you enroll with a doctor - they will have an entire system set up for meds, therapy, and support.

&#x200B;

If you are honestly just DONE with that lifestyle - you can go to an addiction specialist, get on subs, and get some meds onboard (and honestly experiment with your MD to find the perfect cocktail) so you can begin the psychological healing and retraining of normal life function. That can mean a short period of meds and therapy or an extended one - both are acceptable and custom to you as an individual.

&#x200B;

FYI I am not a doctor, so don't take any of this as medical advice. I also never spent time like hunting drugs down on the street because I went from a pain doctor straight to suboxone. But I sit in the group sessions at the addiction doctors office like all the other patients and I have a unique perspective of the challenges because I get to hear them all. I also delt with a spouse with addiction so I feel like I know a thing or two... just maybe. Trust me - when you get official help - you get your life back - but you need to have faith and do all the treatment parts - even if you think they don't apply to you... you get to see first hand where your life could be in the blink of an eye.

EDIT: I am a college student as well in MA and 100% of my treatment is covered under BCBS and my copay for meds is $3.65 per med. Let's say you don't have insurance, the doctor can help you sign up for state-funded health (like we have MassHealth here which is like Medicare) and get you set up with an application, some will even treat while the application processes because the insurance will be retroactive from the date of application. Go onto your state's webpage and look into addiction treatment and find out what programs may be available."
college,fdlpusv,t3_elzg04,1578529639.0,"My second semester back I had about a month of daily anxiety attacks. Its was horrible and exhausting. I was just a mess and I was miserable. My old doctor started trying to get me on medication but kept trying to get me to take meds which made no sense and caused either worse anxiety or made me sick to my stomach. I actually left that doctor shortly after. 

I ended up returning to my old friend welbutrin for help when I needed it during that time. I like welbutrin because I can take it when I need it, and pass when I dont. Once my anxiety and body was under better control I realized I needed a study plan based on what works best for me. I got super organized and had a plan. I also started getting my husband and family to take over some tasks to lighten my load. Things like grocery shopping or doing a couple loads of laundry may seem small but when you can have people do those things for you it lightens your load and lessens the stress. Things slowly improved.

Now I have a study plan based on my learning style and ability, a plan to succeed, and a lot more help. So heres my best advice. First get the anxiety under control with the help of medication or therapy. Next attack the triggers that are bringing the stress up. Is it grades or family? What's causing it? Or are you simply overburdened and need to ask for help? 

Lastly, while the anxiety was severe in my case it did stop and didn't last forever. Now I'm no longer taking meds but I have them in case I need them. Sometimes just having a plan can really reduce the anxiety from the get go.

college,fdfcyjo,t3_ekxla9,1578358769.0,Did you talk to the prof during midterms? After the grade is issued you should think about contacting probably the registration office and ask about how to file a grievance for the grade.

I had 3/4 of an associate in business. Hated business. So I went back to CC and started finishing a science degree as a transfer, got into a 4 year under health sciences bachelor degree with 70% already done. I have 3 semesters left for a health science BS degree and I am minoring in biology with a concentration in pre-PT. When I grad I will be able to apply to PA school, RN school, and PT school as my master's program. Leave the options open I say! My goal is PA - its kinda a dream now but I can SEE myself doing it. If you plan on doing these things you need a health background for hours and shadowing. I am a CNA of 15 years so I already have that in the bag.

Yes. You can keep your options open in healthcare - but look at school requirements and plan it all out. Techs have low ability to lets say move up. With a BS degree  - or really any degree at a bachelor level will give you options. You can apply to PA school with a psych degree, or apply to nursing with a sociology degree. As a tech its a good place to learn more and discover if the field is really what you want. But ill say this - NO health degree will ever do you wrong or be a waste of time."
