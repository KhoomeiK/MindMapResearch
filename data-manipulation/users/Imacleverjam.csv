According to user u/211vanyabanya , this is misinformation.

From his post in r/gay :

""Now first of all about ""two days ago"": Grigorieva was found dead in July, suspect pleaded guilty, and it was not a hate crime.

And ""The Saw"" (google Pila) was a very loud troll-hoax last summer. They never killed anyone, all pictures they posted were old and taken from random sources. They never did anything more serious than  blackmail, but it was taken seriously by many people (google ""Andrey Petrov Pila"" (murder threats) or ""Ekaterinburg lgbt center Pila"" (mass murder\bomb threats, this one actually is my city so I know these nice guys are safe and sound) for instance). Some people moved house in fear, but nothing really happened after that poorly timed death of Elena that this disguisting community taken andvantage of to gain popularity.

I don't know if they inspired anyone to do actual crimes, but by 2020 nothing was heard about that stupid little Tumblr blog.

If anyone feels really dedicated, you can click on this article and hit ""Translate to English"".

Edit: my main point is not that there is nothing to worry about at all in Russia, but that reposting stuff like this without research won't do anything but raise false anxiety among the members of an already anxious community.""

Please stop spreading false information that will just set people on edge.
