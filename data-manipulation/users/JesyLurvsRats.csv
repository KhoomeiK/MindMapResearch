MedicalGore,ffh5kd9,t1_ffgx5q6,1579923718.0,So me crying hysterically in shop class was totally okay then? Cause Mr Teacher didn't find it funny I was terrified. My grandpa had a not so good accident with his and it was an impressionable experience.

Futurology,ffh29m5,t1_ffh000n,1579921168.0,"But the thing with cigarettes is drag time and how deeply you inhale, which adds pretty considerable factors. I went from taking a 10-15min smoke break for a single cig to maybe 3min to suck one down while taking trash out and pick up around the dumpsters a bit. I definitely had worse productive and persistent coughs before I quit cigarettes after sucking them down faster than a hooker with a fix."

I'm not very into the vaping scene, so I probably am not using the right terms. Not like I have anything to lose busting into empty ones. Plus, ya know. Google.

Probably shouldn't do this while drinking wine. Last time I tried to multi-task like this I super glued my glasses to the kitchen table.

news,ffgln66,t1_ffg2cro,1579909098.0,"I remember being in a candy and nut aisle at a grocery store with my younger cousin and my great Nana loudly, and I mean LOUDLY, asked some random person where the nigger toes were. (chocolate covered Brazil nuts, as normal people say) 

Now, I was almost 8. And I was fucking mortified we were going to die before leaving the store. I've never been aware of that many people staring before, craning their necks to watch this old racist Nana and her two great grandkids head to the register.

Once home I asked my mom what that phrase meant, because I only knew that Nana had definitely said a swear because people were staring. Cue very long, screamy phone call to Nana. Cue a very weird conversation with 8yr old me about racial slurs and not to say them ever.

Old people, man. What a trip."
Futurology,ffgknpv,t1_ffgjuqq,1579908430.0,"It's definitely different for everyone. When I switched to vaping I definitely was vaping more because I didn't have to go outside. But since having a time consuming job, I'm less inclined to just sit and toke. I do love doing that when I'm drinking. Something about dat nicotine just hits the spot."
Futurology,ffgkgtt,t1_ffgjlp7,1579908302.0,"I just dislike the general public being purposely misled. It's like when crazy politically dividing shit happens and it's all on the news... And then we find out a few days latee they quietly passed something stupid, bad and harmful in legislation under our noses.

I agree it's absolutely beneficial to be vaping over smoking, but we can't minimize the outlying problems that come with it."
Futurology,ffge2o8,t1_ffgcqcj,1579904173.0,"Problem with juul pods is that they contain a higher nicotine content compared to having a better vape device and choosing the strength of nicotine.

One juul pod contains about the same nicotine as a full pack of smokes. That's a recipe for increasing addiction and sales.

I vape way less on other devices you put juice in compared to a juul device, and I don't have nearly the urge to vape constantly like I did with the juul.

I thought it being smaller was a benefit, the pods are small, so I'll be able to cut back easier than refilling my other devices right? Noooope. Vaping the equivalent of 8 packs of cigarettes in a week opened my eyes. They come in 2 and 4pcks. The 4pks in my area are $18. Hooray, I quit smoking, but then I was going broke for pods. Hopped on the world wide web, did some reading and was not happy about what I found. So juul is definitely dangerous to people who don't have clear info on what they are consuming. Plus, their pods taste like garbage after going back to my old devices and juices. But who knows how long we'll be able to access the different juices in the future...."

Whatever happened next, I don't really know. I just started screaming and I might have blacked out. All I know is that I came to on my back, both hiking buddies laughing and no more leech in my foot. I guess it hadn't decided to latch on? I dunno how all that worked out. But they got it off. After that I said fuck it, I'll trash my shoes over that happening again any day."

AreTheStraightsOK,ffc6d3t,t1_ffbphd5,1579792580.0,"Covert incest is what it could turn into. Some parents, mainly women, seem to think they're entitled to their kid's body no matter how old they are. Inappropriate touching, groping, pinching, etc. I've read many accounts of moms walking in on their kids in the shower, ""inspecting"" how good of a job they did bathing. Some women go as far as trying to be present for diaper changing to make comments on genitals. One such story I read involved a grandmother making lewd comments about her toddler granddaughter's nipples, going as far as to pinch them. Another account described how their mom would lay in bed naked with them to ""cuddle"" because mom was lonely after her divorce. 

It's fucking horrible and disgusting. 

It flies under the radar because people don't think women, especially mothers/grandmothers, can be sexual predators."

If this person needs this validation that badly, then maybe it's time to find a local support group for in person meetings and a better therapist. They're obviously struggling, and none of us are trained or equipped to deal with this. 

And if it's that important... They need to be around others who see the importance. People who support them.
