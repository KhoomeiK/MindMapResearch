i think you stole this meme. how can i tell?

judging by the fact you’re circlejerking reddit, which is cancerous as fuck, it’s easy to come to the conclusion that you didn’t make this meme; because it’s written in the perspective of the original poster, and you require friends to say that in that scenario. 

i think it’s even worse that you’re karma whoring, too, like.. it’s hard enough to be friends with one of those people, but a karma whore too? ouch. imagine being a low life among redditors, one of the lowest of them all (me included).

memes,fdzwcwu,t1_fdzrtqq,1578797381.0,"after it is all said and done; i’d just like to clear up that this isn’t what i meant

what i was saying is that instead of putting (for example) 80% of money putting out the fires, 15% rescuing people/animals and 5% on helping the people who have had to evacuate; 20% should be on putting fires out, 60% should be spent on saving people and benefits for victims, and the other 20% should be on researching ways to lower the global climate temp. so this doesn’t happen again and take EVEN MORE lives etc.; thus why i said you should treat the disease (climate change) instead of the symptoms (the fires)

i know you have good intentions and all, but your mindset is exactly what is holding yourself back from doing great things. this is a common thing, which i wish could not be a thing.

you were really mean at first, and i was guilty of that later as well, it would be better if we apologised and moved on, since we’re both fighting for the same thing, just had a misunderstanding. i’m sorry for the things i said, imma upvote all your replies because that’s good etiquette. have a nice day"
memes,fdzu46q,t1_fdzsw6j,1578795835.0,"i have done something, and that is not buying palm oil products at all. this is because 70,00 hectares of trees have been cut down by mondelez since 2016. 

quick science lesson; trees photosynthesise, they turn carbon dioxide into oxygen (other reactions take place too during photosynthesis, but these are the only relevant ones now). this means that by not buying these products, i am not only reducing climate change/supporting the industry’s that are causing it, and saving the animal populations of the forests which are being cut down, which is exactly the problem in australia; animals are dying. 

it’s very hard to do this, but i’m doing it to help people/animals like in australia. it’s not right for you to point fingers at me (and yes, YOU ARE pointing fingers at me) and say i’m pointing fingers (which i’m not, i am just 14 years old and have my opinion on what would help people the most) and not helping (which i’m clearly not)"

i respect what you’ve done, while i am not doing much in the grand scheme of things, i’m doing something which is more than 90% of the people here can say. it’s really annoying when people do this. last time i linked ways for people to help the environment, i got kicked for posting links in the general channel (where most people were, so thus i posted it there to increase the chances of someone helping)

we may not see eye to eye on what exactly the best way to help people is, we are both helping people and want to help people more, and isn’t that all that matters? instead of calling each other names and getting mad at each other (which i am guilty of, and i apologise) can we just be friends with a mutual desire to help people?

you’re making it seem like i’m the bad guy here, i’m *helping* the cause. i just want to help people, and i might be wrong because i’m 14 and uneducated, but you can really sit here and act like i’m the bad guy here??

what if you put out the fires? climate change is still only gonna get worse if we don’t stop that, that means the fires are gonna come back next summer and be worse. 

don’t reject the people and animals. out the funding on actually helping the humans and animals, as in benefits for the survivors and rescuing the people/animals in danger. and last but not least, spending the money on reversing climate change

as i said earlier, putting out the fires but doing nothing about the fires is treating the symptoms instead of the disease. eventually next summer is gonna roll around and the fires are only going to get worse because no one has done shit about climate change, that means EVEN MORE deaths will occur than they would have otherwise

let’s ignore the title of the post and assume that you were talking about her personal best the entire time; literally everyone beats their own **personal record** for how long they’ve been alive constantly, regardless of if you’re the oldest person or the youngest person, because time doesn’t go backwards, or stop (unless you’ve got a cool punching ghost which you control which can also stop time). just simple logic, not a shower thought"

i use many many platforms, like twitter, reddit, 4chan, instagram and tumblr. i think reddit is definitely top tier, i just hate how people think i’m one of the assholes on r/pewdiepiesubmissions just because they misrepresent the platform as  whole

still though i agree with your idea of ‘if it isn’t hurting anybody, let people do what they want’, that applies in 99% of situations, except from when i get generalised as being an idiot because of r/pewdiepiesubmissions"
woooosh,fcw2t33,t1_faihd7y,1578015832.0,"this is called sleep inertia, where you enter the deeper stages of sleep only to be awoken again only shortly after that

most studies show that the recommended nap time is 10-20 minutes depending on the person, so you should try your hand at sleeping 20 minutes and see how you feel

that’s if i’m remembering this correctly"

mentalhealth,fcvyqkf,t1_fcvx23g,1578013152.0,"thank you! honestly i don’t feel like there was too much too it.. it’s pretty hard to explain. during that 4 month period i wanted to not be alive so desperately, and within a few days after that time, i was feeling good again, well i wouldn’t say “good”.. more like i was on a constant sugar rush, if you know what feeling, i wouldn’t say it was “happiness”, because i really don’t know what that is anymore, i felt empty but happy at the same time and it was really weird, still going on to some extent, the thought of self harming free that time didn’t cross my mind once tbh. 
another thing is that i am seen as childish too! when i was depressed i was seen as really serious  and distant but now i’m seen as hyperactive and childish, i understand you! thought before that it could be bipolar disorder, or it could be that *and* that my gender feels like it’s changing sometimes too :p kinda weird imo tho

i fully expect this to happen again, as it has in the past, so as a new years resolution i’ve thrown away all my sharp objects, and i mean *all* of them. i think now that my self harming has scarred and that’ll never change, it’s easy to know how stupid it was in this state of mind, unlike what happened when i did actually cut myself, hopefully this feeling carries over for the next time i am depressed

i had the growing feeling over the last few weeks that i was suffering from bipolar too, as this pattern of being sad for a period of time and then really happy has happened once before, and it’s happening again, only this time the cycles of highs and lows are getting significantly shorter, still i don’t want to self diagnose myself with it, i’ll just see how it goes 

i’ll definitely give the checklist a try! maybe what’s making it a little bit worse is that i’m being overwhelmed by the large amount of work i have on on the whole, so it would be easier to do it piece by piece

thank you for he help kind stranger, from the bottom of my heart you mean a lot for me, if there is anything i could possibly do to help you out please ask me :p i hope you have an amazing 2020"
