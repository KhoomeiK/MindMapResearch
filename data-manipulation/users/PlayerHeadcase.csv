Decades ago, catching a politician in a lie almost anywhere in the West meant real problems for the MP- resignation was often the norm, as the press used to attack their exposed weak point repeatedly until something happened.  
Now, the Independent (and maybe the Guardian) mention it once, while the BBC and the Murdoch / Barclays media just ignore it."
