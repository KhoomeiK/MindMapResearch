medizzy,fffhe2o,t1_fff3z5t,1579884004.0,"I'm so sorry that was such an unpleasant experience! And it's definitely something that you don't have control over. I've seen paraplegic patients with feeding tubes who stayed inpatient and definitely got the full prep, but turned out with results similar to yours. 

If you don't mind me asking, did you get a spinal and request no sedation? I usually recommend to relatively healthy patients that they get a little short-term sedation on board to make things less mentally uncomfortable.

I think in that circumstance with an awake patient it's really important for the GI doc to say something like, ""Sometimes that happens, let's make the best of it!"" in a cheerful, or at least nonjudgmental, tone. I got a shirtful of shart once with a patient who was waking up. I couldn't be sure if they would remember, so I said something along the lines of, ""You'd be surprised, but this has happened more than once. That's why we wear scrubs to change out of!"""
medizzy,fff303e,t1_fff2jp3,1579874322.0,"Glad to hear it, because a good screening colonoscopy is important for your health! 

Lol, I haven't seen anything during colonoscope besides poo and polyps. But I've done some general surgery cases where retained objects had to be removed surgically because it would cause too much damage (or it would be very difficult) to get things out the way they went in. The two most memorable ones were a softball and a not-made-for-butts vibrator with a blunt end that (obviously) couldn't be turned off.

Edited to add: I love your username! Is it a pun on _la petite mort_?"
medizzy,fff2dw5,t1_ffey4im,1579873836.0,"I do have to say though, watching the doc with the scope is often entertaining.  Many of the newer fellows do the ""Mario Kart"" thing where they move the handle in the direction they want the camera to go, even though it's not actually going to do anything. And most have interesting ""I'm concentrating"" looks that they're not aware of making, it's very cute."

medizzy,fff1z1a,t1_ffezx8g,1579873501.0,"Honestly I don't know. My best guess is that they drink the stuff and think, ""That's gross, but okay I'll drink it"" until the effects of the stuff start to kick in, at which point they say, ""Screw it, that should be good enough"" and come in for their appointment the next day.

I remember when my dad had his first colonoscopy, he called me in the afternoon (I had warned him to take two days off work so that he could follow directions) and asked how he'd know if he was drinking as much of the mixture as he should. I replied once it felt and looked like he was peeing out of his butt it's working, and reminded him to drink a lot of juice and water."
medizzy,fff1bik,t1_ffez20x,1579872964.0,"As u/twcsata said, yes to both. The only thing I have to add is that based on how bad it is once you get in there + how stubborn your GI doc is that day (or how necessary the results from the colonoscopy are), they may not reschedule and just try to make the best of it. In which case, you end up with some epic sharts during and after the procedure. 

I think the thing patients don't think about is that colonoscopies are ""just another day at the office"" for the people involved in performing them. Patients are always much more sensitive about the procedure than we are, but just know that whatever happens during your procedure, odds are that some poor schmuck has done something even more interesting and memorable.

medizzy,ffew33v,t1_ffepzgu,1579867969.0,But you don't know how well the patient followed directions until they're under sedation/anesthesia and you're in there. There's always at least one unpleasant surprise on scope days.
medicine,ferki57,t1_fepkq8t,1579355067.0,"I only know the laws in Washington and Oregon, but NPs there can practice independently as new graduates, which is similar to the scope of practice as physicians, including prescribing opiates. And as an example, the University of Washington has different DNP tracks, including an acute-care ARNP track which allows a beside nurse to become virtually an intensivist in three years. The only thing stopping them is whether a hospital will actually hire them into that particular specialty.

With laws and education programs like, that the only thing preventing nurses from trying to act like physicians is the individual's common sense and the hiring practices of hospitals. Yes, many advanced-practice nurses _do_ have many years of experience, but not all do, and the fact that people can just do the bare minimum and then go on to wield a scope of practice comparable to that of an attending is terrifying to me. 

State laws and nursing educational systems should be doing more to keep patients safe, not just churn out under-prepared practitioners to feel like they're doing something, or to try and gain more prestige/legitimacy. It sounds like the laws in NM are doing a better job than in many other states."

medicine,ferhyl7,t1_feqlzua,1579354117.0,"Absolutely! I love your phrase, ""the soul of nursing,"" that's _exactly_ what bedside RNs are. 

I loved being an ICU nurse (on most days, lol) but I was told from day one of nursing school to be more than ""just"" an RN (literally, in many cases) by teachers, preceptors, and, of course, the nursing organizations. It's so sad."
medicine,fergxmy,t1_fepsmla,1579353710.0,"You're right, I should put the qualifier that this is if you _just_ look at the education aspect, and looking at advanced-practice nursing broadly. 

There are tons of individual advanced practice nurses who are fantastic. I hope I'll be one of those myself. But our education system and many states' regulations have allowed us to be dangerously over-confident/under-prepared, and the health care system shouldn't be relying on the motivation and experience of individuals to keep patients safe. 

I've met too many NPs, CRNAs, and midwives who think they're physicians, but have no real understanding of medical education and training. I personally will only ever work in a team model, but several of my classmates have stated that they never want to work with anesthesiologists (and many former graduates from my program have actually gone on to do that as new grads). I don't think that should be an option."
medicine,fepkfqq,t1_feomza8,1579322820.0,"There are definitely many, many smart and self-motivated nurses who go out of their way to learn more and excel at their jobs. But based  what I've seen, I'd say that the gap between the bottom quartile and the mean amongst nurses/nursing students is huge compared to the same metric for medical students and residents, and I attribute much of that to admission and curriculum standards. It's not just the hours of training, but the quality and standardization of the education."
medicine,fepjm8p,t1_fensx0x,1579322194.0,"That's in the best case scenario. Many only require 500-1,000 hours, but some take applications from nursing students completing their initial RN degree. And don't forget about MEPN programs, which allow you to basically bypass obtaining experience working as a bedside nurse."
medicine,fepj4vz,t1_fepfi47,1579321832.0,What about MEPN programs? That's absolutely no nursing experience. And I also know some NPs who worked for years as nurses....but I also know some who applied and got in as they were finishing their BSNs.

medicine,fepi85m,t1_fep4iff,1579321162.0,"It's so frustrating because nurses are so vital to patient care! Bedside nurses are the most likely to be the first ones to see when something guess wrong, and are often the  final safety check as physicians' orders are carried out. 

Nurses aren't physicians, we're separate professions that work in parallel and partnership, but for some reason the ANA and a vocal minority keep pushing that ""heart of a nurse, brain of a doctor"" bullshit. I don't know why they can't be proud of being nurses, and the work that the vast majority of nurses perform.

Also, experience counts for so much, but I also think nursing education for both RNs and APRNs should be much more robust and rigorous. Especially considering how sick patients are nowadays, and how quickly medical knowledge and technology is moving."
medicine,fepgun4,t1_feoogbp,1579320153.0,"After the ""we are the answer"" bullshit from the AANA last year I was going to refuse to continue membership, but someone pointed out that it would be more useful to be a choice of change from within. I've been writing emails in protest to my state organization and the AANA as they've been publishing more nonsense, and I plan on supporting most of the ASA's political efforts when they come up."
medicine,fepgeep,t1_feor90k,1579319839.0,"It's a self-imposed brain drain. I worked at a ""top Magnet"" hospital, and tbh I'm not sure how I got hired because I went to a community college RN program. The year after I was hired it became official policy to only hire BSNs, which is a joke because the RN-to-BSN program I later took was a year's worth of ""leadership"" and ""clinical inquiry"" classes with absolutely no additional clinical training."
medicine,feoh3rg,t1_fenhh4u,1579299996.0,"Completely agree. I graduated from a program that promotes itself for having many CRNA-only rotations, and claims that their graduates are ready to practice independently as new grads. It's a load of crap. 

I also agree that the ANA had abandoned bedside RNs, and this has lead to some dangerous consequences. Working bedside has always been hard, and nurses are extremely prone to burnout. And the message that you're not ""living up to your potential"" and that you're not ""growing as a leader in your profession"" if you stay bedside isn't helping at all. 

NP programs were originally designed with experienced beside nurses in mind, but now we have people who put in only one or two years before applying for grad school. Or even MEPN programs with no real working experience as a nurse. All this leads to dangerously inexperienced midlevels, and a smaller pool of bedside nurses with high turnover, which makes the nursing shortage even worse. 

I was shocked when I learned that a large local hospital in my area has a workforce of nurses whose average work experience is TWO YEARS. Looking back, I barely knew anything when I was two years into  my bedside career! 

The ANA needs to stop over-glorifying becoming an NP and focus on the fact that we need more RNs with experience. They, and all the APRN groups, need to put more time, energy, and money into overhauling the nursing education system if they truly want legitimacy and prestige.

NoStupidQuestions,fci9mbp,t1_fci0t72,1577659435.0,"Good question, I'm sure a lot of people want to know the same thing! For the most part, the answer is not necessarily. 

Depending on what it's doing to your blood flow, it may do nothing, or maybe just make getting you off to sleep either longer (by seconds to minutes, nothing drastic) or faster than expected, depending on what anesthetic is being used. There's a higher risk of some specific complications that can occur if air gets into your bloodstream, but that's a really rare event.

Up to 1/4 of the population has these holes in the heart, although most of them are tiny and don't cause any mischief. 

If we  think during a case that there's a hole in the heart because unexpected things are happening, we manage your case and keep your body safe as we figure out what's going on. If we know ahead of time that there's a hole in the heart there are extra precautions we can take to prevent problems. 

Although most people think our job is to""knock people out"" for surgery, the real stuff we do is manage risk, prevent dangerous situations from occurring, solve problems, and keep patients safe when unexpected things happen."
NoStupidQuestions,fci5p3t,t1_fci1ijv,1577658069.0,"I completely agree that advanced practice nursing education needs to be MUCH more in-depth and should have A LOT more of everything: higher admission standards, more in-depth didactic foundations, SO MUCH MORE clinical training experience, and something like a nationally structured residency before practicing. 

I also think that advanced practice nurses and our advocacy organizations need to get their heads out of their collective asses and act like we're proud of our professions, rather than displaying the ""I'm almost a doctor"" shoulder chips for everyone to roll their eyes at. And they should definitely stop trying to drag down other professions, particularly physicians. 

That said, I feel like the work done by anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists overall have much greater overlap than physicians and nurse practitioners, which is why I made the comment above. 

Personally, I like working in a care team model, I love the anesthesiologists I work with, and I don't ever want to work independent practice."

For the cases that I'm actually trained and credentialed to do, I know as close to 100% of what's necessary as a trained provider can get,  and will be managing the case pretty much the same as a physician anesthesiologist.

NoStupidQuestions,fchfrau,t1_fch12se,1577650056.0,"Putting someone under anesthesia means putting their body in a completely different state from ""normal."" Lots of things can go wrong under anesthesia that are expected/known side effects from the drugs we use, and wouldn't cause any problems in every day life, so there's no need for the patient to know. 

For example, tons of anesthetic drugs can cause dangerously low blood pressure, which is a big problem in the OR. But you're never going to have that problem outside the OR because you don't have those drugs in your system. 

Very rarely the stress of surgery and anesthesia reveals a problem that a patient has been living with, but hadn't caused any problems (yet). In this case we would definitely talk to the surgeon or patient's doctor, and make sure the patient is aware of the problem. 

One example is a small hole in a person's heart. You can live without ever knowing it's there, but it can cause issues under anesthesia, and it may cause problems as the person ages, so we make sure the patient is made aware and gets the necessary evaluations."
