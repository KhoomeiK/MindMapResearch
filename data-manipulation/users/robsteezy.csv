TechNewsToday,ffile18,t3_etn5ov,1579976656.0,The irony here is fucking hilarious. People using an app to have random sex with strangers feel in danger.....riiiiiiight.
therewasanattempt,ffikhfs,t1_ffifpfa,1579976033.0,"Their problem is the sub used to be actual attempts. A baby would try to grab a bottle off a bed, fall off, eat shit and we all laugh at the attempt. The problem is that now this sub is just social media posts with “their was an attempt to be woke/racist/etc”."
starterpacks,fffsyd1,t3_et7qt2,1579891117.0,Idk who he is but fuck that ginger kid who reacts to shit. I want somebody to take a barstool to his face everytime I see his thumbnails.
DunderMifflin,ff3oj7m,t1_ff32168,1579545471.0,I always wondered if he meant he was gonna fuck her more or do anal.
fightporn,fensne2,t1_fen30d6,1579290107.0,The way the screen turned purple as the big dude prepped his move felt like he was using a special in a video game.
fightporn,fenrxn6,t1_fen76qo,1579289912.0,"Story time: back in college a friend of mine was in a professional co Ed fraternity and one night their new pledge invites her abusive drunk of a boyfriend to their dinner event where (surprise surprise) he proceeds to drink to the point where he is getting violent with her outside. 

One of the weaker men in the group has the balls to tell the drunkard to stop touching her so violently at which point the drunk shoves the weak man, who happens to be in my friends fraternity. At this point my friend insists the drunk stop acting the way he is and the guy decided to sucker punch my friend. Well peeps, my friend was an amateur boxer back in our high school days and the second the guy sucker punched him, my friend punched his straight in the gut. The second the drunk was bent over 90 degrees out of breath, my friend kneed him in the head to break 4 of his teeth out. 

Next week the dumb bitch actually plays into her battered woman syndrome and defends her bf saying he just “gets like that” and the guy demanded my friend give him 10k or “he would sue”. We laughed in his beat up fucking face and told him to go ahead. Motherfucker didn’t have 1) a case to go on, 2) the money to pay an attorney and 3) his front 4 teeth. 

Moral of the story: the law isn’t gonna save you when you’re in the street writing checks too big for your big fucking mouth to cash."
fightporn,fenqtwa,t3_eq0q19,1579289490.0,The whole time that boy was barking I assumed he was at least talking to somebody his own weak fucking size but god damn I didn’t know he was a rat snipping at a hippos ankles.
Overwatch,fenqgjp,t1_femn2g9,1579289275.0,Wait a minute?!...are you saying the game rewards healers for.....healing?! Somebody please tell my healers this bc they apparently think lucio is tracer and brig is a reaper.
unpopularopinion,fenpfmx,t3_eq2knz,1579288894.0,"While I agree with this, I wonder how others opinions would change as the money amount increases. 

Letting a homeless person piss away 5 bucks on liquor seems happy go lucky and insignificant enough to not care. 

Now imagine a person had to give them 5 thousand dollars and watch what they’d do with it and then be asked if they would give them more after watching it be used in any way the homeless person so desired."
coolguides,fennrg7,t1_femwkgm,1579288371.0,"Trippy to realize that even though a lot more tragic, 911 kinda was just the talibans modern version of a canon shot at a castle."
dankmemes,fekpg81,t1_fek67vo,1579204884.0,You didn’t get it bc you have to be a gay black woman.
confusing_perspective,fehxux1,t1_feey92u,1579126043.0,"Ahh I see. Interestingly enough as soon as I read your description I immediately remembered a video that was a mini segment on such collectible houses but god that must’ve been over 15 years ago now. 

I completely forgot that collectible miniatures aren’t just in the forms of toys. Cheers."
WTF,fehf1ao,t1_fehekxm,1579115198.0,Thanks for the response. Looks like the gators literally understand “don’t bite the hand that feeds” haha.
BeAmazed,feheru2,t1_fegdb7g,1579115045.0,"With successful sculptors and caricature artists, it’s actually not about perfectly getting a replica. They use generic references of the head shape and then focus on and highlight distinguishing marks like a wrinkle or a mole that your friends and family know is distinguishably you.  Those unique attributes are more effective than a perfect replica."
