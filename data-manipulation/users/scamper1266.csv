AmItheAsshole,ff179pe,t3_eqzf0e,1579475967.0,NAH- I struggled with something similar in high school being mixed race myself. I never felt Mexican enough and the other kids made me aware of that. They said I look too white or too this or too that. I felt really ashamed to be white and not accepted in either culture. It’s pretty common for mixed/biracial kids to go through this feeling of not belonging to either community. Do not force him to join that club he’s just going to end up trying to push away even more. He’ll participate more when he’s ready.
