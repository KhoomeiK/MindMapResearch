whowouldwin,ffmy0h6,t1_ffmx0up,1580060084.0,That’s neat. He’s a planet buster in Asura’s wrath though...
whowouldwin,ffmuhso,t1_ffmttfb,1580059071.0,Then how about you prove it with gameplay footage of SFIV? It’s a different version of the same character.
whowouldwin,ffmshlo,t1_ffmpzcg,1580058423.0,Buddy I’m really not sure how else to explain this to you... That footage is from Asura’s wrath. Asura’s wrath /= street fighter. Get it? They’re **different games**.

whowouldwin,ffmic8l,t1_fflkc22,1580055119.0,... you do realize that’s not gameplay footage of street fighter right? It’s a completely different game. It has literally nothing to do with this thread.

starterpacks,ffii09s,t1_ffiecx9,1579974334.0,Don’t feel bad. Pretty sure the writers thought that too.
TrueOffMyChest,ffh5tft,t1_ffh59p9,1579923917.0,">	No it doesn’t imply that at all. To the bi person I gave an example about, a cis or trans man had the same effect (in terms of attraction) on them. I mentioned both cis and trans so that no one would think that I just meant cis, because trans men are men.

Ok so? It makes perfect sense for a bi person to be attracted to both because a cis man looks like a man and a trans man might look like a woman. So of course both are attractive. Hence the bi-sexuality. 

>That’s more the M.O. of bi people...and clearly you don’t understand pansexuality if you think everyone’s all about dicks or vaginas or both.

Than how about you explain it? Make me understand."
TrueOffMyChest,ffh4p74,t1_ffh3wr3,1579923042.0,"That implies trans people are something other than man or woman. Whether it's a man in a woman's body or vice versa it's still one or the other. You either like dicks or vaginas or both. 

If I see a trans man who's the spitting image of Kate Upton you can be damn sure I'd find him attractive. I might not have sex with him but I'd still find him attractive. But that's just personal preference. Kinda like big tits or small tits. That doesn't mean big tit lovers are a different sexuality than small tit lovers."
savedyouaclick,fffoklg,t1_fffo2wb,1579888407.0,Just so you know posting a huge Wikipedia article and claiming it proves something without specifying where is a pretty shit way of getting your point across.
