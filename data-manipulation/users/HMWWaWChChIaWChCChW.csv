Either that or you would have to put your couch against the fireplace which is even worse. And most houses are built with a fireplace, though that might finally be in decline.

It’s also subjective based on the scope you have (IMO). A red dot headshot at 200m can be ust as impressive as say a 4x headshot at 300-350. (I’m throwing kind of random numbers out here, I’m probably off but it’s the idea I’m trying to convey)"

By the end of the third season, he had proven Bryce wrong, that he made a good CIA agent. Most of the times that he saved the day, it wasn’t the Intersect that was the deciding factor, it was Chuck’s ability to think on his feet and his vast knowledge of all things nerdy. The Intersect turning him into Keanu was a great bonus, but again it was second to his intelligence."

When we got to season 3 and they kept pretending that he wasn’t, I got tired.

They should have ended season two (or three if they were more focused) finding out that Red was a deep cover CIA agent who got turned into the “bad guy” to root out the real evil in the world (kind of like Jason Bourne in the books), and giving him a hero’s retirement."

I remember with Zoom, the obvious bad guy was the newly introduced Flash. I was like, there’s no way they’re going to do that. It’s too easy. Instead they should have had alt-Wally (the one character that didn’t have a version of himself in the alt-earth and who was obsessed with going faster when they introduced him) be Zoom.
