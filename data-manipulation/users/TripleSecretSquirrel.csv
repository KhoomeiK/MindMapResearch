aww,ffq5k47,t3_euj1sv,1580121696.0,"Growing up, I had a dog that was spayed and never had puppies. A cat showed up and adopted us, then immediately had kittens. The dog’s maternal instincts kicked in, and she decided to adopt one of the kittens. She took it off to a different corner of the yard and proceeded to lick the hell out of it, presumably cause that’s what she’d seen the mother cat do. The mother cat wasn’t real happy and came and got her very slobbery baby back. They all got along great after that for the next ten or so years."
