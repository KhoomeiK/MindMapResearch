science,ffe3mh3,t3_et2gob,1579835825.0,"Most people don't get abortions for fun.  In our case it was birth control failure.  It was never a baby to me; rather an unwanted side effect that could result in one.  Fortunately or unfortunately, I miscarried and needed a medical abortion to help it along.  Unwanted pregnancies should never be forced on anyone.  

We also need to break this mentality of 'regret' and an inability to forget/heal/let go.  Moving past it and not obsessing over it is fine.  No one should be constantly reminded or made to feel guilty for moving on with life."
