I will try and calculate the mass of DM inside the orbit of Mercury (Rmin = 4.6*10e7 Km).
 
Assuming your given DM density of 10e-12 kg/km^3 and using Mass =  Volume * Density.  

Volume is (4/3)pi.R^3 =  ~(4*3/3)*5^3*10e21 Km^3 = 1 * 10e23 Km^3.

So the DM mass inside orbit of Mercury is ~ (1 * 10e23 *10e-12) Kg = 1*10e11 Kg.

Mass of the Sun   = 2 * 10e30 Kg.
Mass of the Earth = 6 * 10e24 Kg.

So the DM mass inside Mercury's orbit is ~ 10e-13 Earth Masses ~ 10e-19 Solar Masses."
