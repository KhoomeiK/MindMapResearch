illnessfakersgonewild,ffjxmhv,t1_ffjtlly,1580009760.0,"Dude bee allergies are scary as hell, like you don't know you're allergic until it happens."
service_dogs,ffjwdib,t1_ffjhebn,1580008762.0,It looks like Sasha was still in service gear as well.
service_dogs,ffjqyno,t1_ffjhrbr,1580004663.0,Out of curiosity do you have someone help you train hearing tasks? Like enlist a family member to call your name while you treat etc.
dogs,ffjavre,t3_etvsfy,1579994454.0,"Rottweilers, they are extremely intelligent and fun to train. My boy was a big bear and I miss him everyday. Although my favorite breed is a rottie, German shepherds are definitely growing on me."
illnessfakersgonewild,ffj5lvt,t1_ffhzsfz,1579990985.0,"Yeah you are correct, my friend told me about the time he was injured while deployed and how he hallucinated. He ended up losing his leg because of that injury."
illnessfakersgonewild,ffijxoq,t3_etq1hx,1579975653.0,It bothers me so much that he is working Aki as his service dog when she is reactive and not cut out for the job.
service_dogs,ffi8syy,t3_etrtpt,1579968039.0,"I do this a lot, I'm the type of handler that tries to restrain from giving too much love/cuddles while we are working because then I'll get sidetracked and just cuddle him. But at times where we are in a stressful packed situation I'll give him a good pat on the head and tell him good boy."
service_dogs,ffi7lg1,t1_ffi4i8p,1579967181.0,"I'm sensitive to both cold and heat depending on the weather but I just make sure to wear the right layers for the cold. A lot of people don't realize they aren't wearing the correct clothing to retain heat in the winter. I'm thankful my husband knows how to navigate cold weather gear to keep me warm. But if I forgot a layer sure I'll use my dog for warmth but it's not exactly what I would consider a task. 

Just like other users have mentioned a doctor would have to consider you disabled in way that relates to that for it to be considered a task related to your disability."
service_dogs,ffi2vxy,t3_etr226,1579963492.0,For me this is like a bonus because it is only useful in certain situations. I don't consider it a task because it does not mitigate my disability.
service_dogs,ffh4j8o,t3_etk3bh,1579922914.0,I work my boy without his vest a lot because while we are in class I take off his vest so he can get comfortable. So he acts well behaved but when we are home he acts like a shithead in doors. I try to keep his craziness to a minimum when we are walking around our apartment complex. He's a German Shepherd so I make sure that he always shows off his best self to my neighbors.

service_dogs,ffdo1oo,t3_et1wqs,1579824972.0,"There isn't anything you can do to prevent somebody thinking you are a fake. Some people are just willingly ignorant and don't bother seeing the whole picture. Dogs in training will make mistakes and it's bound to happen at one point or another. 

For example, my boy barked at a huge water jug today. It was super embarrassing but I ignored what others may have thought and made sure familiarize my boy with the jug of water while giving him treats for inspecting the water jug (think those office jugs).

service_dogs,ffcag3z,t1_ffc9g0b,1579795196.0,There isn't a way to know if a puppy will be a good alert dog or not.
illnessfakersgonewild,ffb9hi3,t1_ffah7ut,1579756149.0,"Just throwing this out there, a guide dog school in Canada specifically breed mixed dogs to get larger dogs. They breed lab/Bernese mixes and their dogs are working out really well for them."
service_dogs,ff7igzo,t3_es39a4,1579650318.0,Are you talking about the normal county license? Also health insurance doesn't cover service dogs so they don't care if you have one since it doesn't affect them. Are you in the u.s or do you happen to be in another country?
dogs,ff4noto,t3_ermfd8,1579568041.0,The only thing I can think of is to teach a stop command where she stops what she's doing immediately. But it's most likely just her personality cuz I know of a dog who can run up walls somehow. He loves hanging out on roofs and it's pretty nuts to see. Some dogs just like different things I guess.
illnessfakersgonewild,ff3v7hs,t1_ff3imzi,1579549571.0,She's whiter looking than my half Russian daughter.
illnessfakersgonewild,ff3t66b,t1_ff2chqx,1579548308.0,I assumed it was a woman based on their replied here lol
illnessfakersgonewild,ff34yb3,t1_ff2qke4,1579533784.0,From what he told me he was still on the field  and one of the working dogs came over to him. He said the dog was talking to him but obviously that didn't happen. He had no pain medication so im assuming that's why he hallucinated or maybe he was just blacked out dreaming who knows.
service_dogs,ff290wr,t1_ff24yyx,1579497359.0,"I don't fly so I'm not sure if you can explain, but is it because he does DPT that you have to be held to psych. dog standards or the alerts?"
illnessfakersgonewild,ff23r0z,t1_ff1x4k7,1579492991.0,My friend was shot really bad in Afghanistan (a long time ago) and he said he hallucinated that the malinois was talking to him. He ended up losing his leg because of it.
illnessfakersgonewild,ff23h1t,t1_ff1jyib,1579492774.0,I was attacked by a dog as a young adult and that was the worst pain I've ever felt. I can't imagine going through that pain as a kid.
Dogtraining,ff1t07l,t3_er53ma,1579485513.0,"I think you need to add more information in order to help others understand more. How much exercise does she get a day, how much mental stimulation, and what sort of training methods have you done. I know you said she's treat motivated but it's kind of hard to understand when you say nothing has worked."
Dogtraining,feyq3uy,t3_eqxr4n,1579449145.0,You didn't list this command but I lost it under foundational. The back command has been easy for other dogs I have had. My current dog can do it but he does it crooked. It's just so hard for him and he really struggles with this command.
dogs,few6r45,t1_fevxbr6,1579406096.0,"What, they're so cute!"
dogs,few6bke,t1_fevhk8u,1579405901.0,I haven't met a doodle that wasn't a neurotic mess. They are cute looking as hell but I would never want to own one.
Epilepsy,fevdsmd,t1_fev64sb,1579396258.0,"It is best to tell your neurologist, but for some it is not out of the norm for their seizure type to change. I've gone through many different seizure types over the years and they can change suddenly. My doctor's says that is normal for some and that nothing has changed with my epilepsy."
Dogtraining,fev8v2g,t3_eqmva4,1579394487.0,"Sometimes that isn't outgrown, I would start training relaxation techniques. I believe there is the relaxation training protocol which is super popular."
dogs,fev6r34,t3_eqnfev,1579393764.0,The one thing I would be worried about is when he is out working and he happens to fall asleep. I have a service dog in training and recently some random lady put her face in his face while he was sleeping and woke him up. Something like that could happen in the future which may cause him to wash if he has a bad reaction.
service_dogs,feutmux,t1_feueevh,1579389765.0,"What nonprofit is that, a lot of nonprofits have steered away from mixes for the exact opposite reason."

dogs,feto1tg,t1_feovfp5,1579377447.0,"You guys have an access test you have to pass, unless it's optional. I have always heard Canadians had to take the public access test."
dogs,fetmgtm,t1_fetjd8n,1579376848.0,Emotional support animals require zero training while service animals go through years and years of training.
illnessfakersgonewild,fespk13,t1_fes1oyp,1579367664.0,"Even the applesauce ones are kind of gross, my kid refuses to eat it."
Epilepsy,fepm2w2,t1_fepl9t1,1579324093.0,"It doesn't even have to be a single parent, both my parents worked full time for us to barely scrape by. Some kids are lucky to grow up in a neighborhood that isn't filled with crime. There is zero reason to blame that other commenters mother without more knowledge of the situation."
Epilepsy,feplpz5,t1_fepl9yz,1579323812.0,"No actually, it was the pharmacy that said it was policy to not refill prescriptions early."
Epilepsy,fepk4nf,t1_fepfntl,1579322580.0,There is zero reason to blame their mother when you have no idea of the situation. I grew up in a dirty poor neighborhood. There were gangs and drugs everywhere. Many kids started drugs at a young age despite their parents trying to keep them from hanging out with the wrong crowd. These are parents working many shifts trying to pay for rent.
Epilepsy,fepjy11,t1_fepjecv,1579322438.0,Some pharmacies won't let you do that.
Dogtraining,fepjs79,t3_eq7sti,1579322318.0,"It's just a dog in public problem, service dogs of every size have this same issue it's not unique to small dogs."
dogs,fepiqen,t3_eqbpab,1579321539.0,Medication can indeed stop her seizures if they can find the right dosage and medication. Seizures can change so many things about the dog or human. It can even make them aggressive during post ictal stages. I would suggest taking her to a professional and hopefully getting on some medication.
funny,fepgu5u,t1_fepamo5,1579320144.0,"I don't think it's dog speech, the crab meme says practically the same thing but instead it says ""you mess with the crabbo you get the stabbo"""
service_dogs,fepcaj0,t3_eqat2k,1579317011.0,"Trying to mimic a classroom environment is the best way to prepare. So going to the library and tucking into a small area and ""studying"" for like 1 hour. You slowly up the time and distractions, your dog needs to get used to people walking around a classroom or backpacks opening up really loudly all at once."
illnessfakersgonewild,feoz8ix,t1_feoq1f5,1579308604.0,"That's like next level memory right there, for my kids first 8 months of her life I wrote her birthday wrong on all her paperwork at doctors offices. I wasn't aware it wasn't her birthday until her dad asked me why I kept writing her birthday incorrectly."
illnessfakersgonewild,feoy8s4,t1_fent7m1,1579307985.0,How come you don't feed them raw since you're going as far as cooking meals.
illnessfakersgonewild,feopu9g,t1_feo9796,1579303699.0,I know someone who took a polygraph during his time getting hired by the local police. They asked him his name and apparently that was the only lie it caught. He had to bring more proof that his name was indeed his actual name.
illnessfakersgonewild,feoplas,t1_feoeprz,1579303577.0,I love how you are just full of all kinds of information.
Dogtraining,feoii2y,t1_feoh5qz,1579300645.0,"More so diabetes, epilepsy alert and response dogs are usually much bigger to be able to guide the handler to a safe area."
dogs,feo99fn,t1_fenbdx0,1579296800.0,It is too young to be working but a lot of service dog programs actually start public access young. There are programs that work with universities that send their young pups into classrooms for training.
dogs,feo7404,t1_fenph7q,1579295981.0,There are service dogs in training at 8 months old who act better than this dog. The age isn't really the issue here it's the training.
service_dogs,fen2q5d,t3_epuyqb,1579275661.0,I have no issue with the one Tigris vests and I put a molle pouch on it so he can hold important stuff. He's got pretty long hair and it's never covered his vest.
illnessfakersgonewild,felz841,t1_felot4v,1579234771.0,I haven't seen my mother in law in over three years and it's amazing
fountainpens,felxwvs,t3_epuk8q,1579233734.0,"Look into kaweco, their sport models (plastic bodies) are entry level prices."
dogs,fek67ct,t1_fejoa2j,1579193450.0,"It really depends on the individual dog, my rottie was so gentle and careful with my child. He was around her since the moment she was born until she was three. In my opinion rotties have been more gentle around young children and less clumsy. While my gsd is super clumsy and is always running over my toddler. I have to definitely be ontop of him so he can be careful around her. 

Gsds have way more tenacity for training while my rottie would go around what is being asked at times."
Epilepsy,feizlxo,t1_feiza74,1579151752.0,Cutting back on credits is seriously the best thing you can do. If you can only handle one class then just take one class. So what if we finish our degrees later than others. My major is biochem and I just transferred to a university. They make a big deal about taking 15 credits per semester to graduate on time. I'm only taking like 6 credits my first semester. So two chem lectures plus one chem lab. I realized if I want to do good and not drop I need to lower my classes to what I can do and not compare myself to others.
service_dogs,feixy8d,t1_feiv1bu,1579150314.0,"Rex specs is the only actual wearable option that works unfortunately. My boy has a pair but it's because everything in school for me is a lab (biochem major). I'm not aware of any other options, if you plan on taking more lab classes it might be worth it."

illnessfakersgonewild,fei7fhq,t1_fehd97e,1579131961.0,"My aunt has had cancer three times, she didn't lose much hair to my surprise. She has colon cancer this time around (3rd time) and she looked sickly and her hair was dull but the thickness of her hair doesn't look like it's changed."
illnessfakersgonewild,fehvwia,t1_fehsm81,1579124919.0,I love how blunt nurses are!
service_dogs,fehs5vh,t1_fehps7l,1579122804.0,"Also to throw in, there's a good amount of service dogs that look like fakes due to companies taking advantage of people. For example, a veteran at my VRC at college has a service dog. This dog is not fit for service work at all and has a horrible horrible prey drive. Like this program admitted she would probably kill an animal if the guy wasn't careful. 

This program passed the dog because they were getting money from a veteran organization. Everytime this dog sees my sdit she goes into such a tense mode that I always leave because she looks like she's going to attack my boy. These people aren't aware this is way out of the norm and they are getting taken advantage of."
dogs,fehrb52,t1_fehm1kc,1579122319.0,"Oh yes I'm totally aware, a lot of dogs are different but I've worked with a couple that can feel it on level 2/100."
dogs,fehe8yw,t1_fehcy47,1579114740.0,I've personally used an ecollar on my body and even I don't like going above an 8 on myself. I've personally seen them call a young male gsd off of a squirrel with just a ten. The malis I can't say since I haven't seen them chase an animal while offleash training. They don't go off chasing from what I have seen but they are older and more experienced.
dogs,fehcp6p,t1_fehc29c,1579113847.0,Dog trainers that I personally work with and know. These are k9 dog handlers from sof units who work with malinois day in and day out. I also know lots of pet dog trainers that train dogs between stim 1-8. I have personally never seen one go above a ten. Even the hunting dog trainer I know doesn't go past a ten on his labs or clients.
dogs,feh8x7k,t1_fegplf7,1579111590.0,"Most ecollars go to about a 100, so if yours is 6/10 my bet is on a good ecollar that's in the 60s which of course would hurt. Most dog trainers don't go above 10/100 on the ecollar because it isn't needed."
illnessfakersgonewild,fefr60u,t1_fefqs7f,1579062821.0,There's like multiple people in the comments stating that they can't be diagnosed because doctor's refuse to see past their weight.
illnessfakersgonewild,fefmvy7,t1_fedobqq,1579059783.0,It looks like they have two trash cans and one could be for recyclables.
service_dogs,fef22el,t1_feezqwp,1579046346.0,I think this is what their therapist was trying to point out.
dogs,fedtxim,t1_fednb6d,1579019818.0,They are probably going to make you come in person so it could actually be filed.
dogs,feclro3,t1_febxpdd,1578977053.0,"My cat hated affection, I could have died and he would have not missed shit as long as he was still fed."
service_dogs,fe8qtjq,t1_fe8ppf3,1578929514.0,They have super strict rules because they could lose their program if it's not followed. That's the only reason why a service dog is not allowed which is reasonable.
service_dogs,fe6pwto,t3_eo0bjc,1578899907.0,I would recommend getting a program dog in your situation. In that case they would choose the breed which would be much easier on you.
service_dogs,fe6posg,t3_enz5g3,1578899622.0,"You don't have to but it's polite to give the professor a heads up when you bring a service dog to class. I usually offer them to meet my dog after class as well so they don't feel nervous around him if they aren't dog people.

Oh sorry I didn't read your question right, I would talk to them privately in person and ask if they have any questions. That's usually what I do and if you are nervous you can do it during private office hours."

service_dogs,fe62nx3,t3_enx8ws,1578880419.0,"What I found really annoying was constantly being stopped while walking to class on campus. I've also had a lot of people yell at me on campus over my boy. A lot of stares and a lot of random people recording me. That's just having a service dog in general tho. 

I never had any campus difficulties besides not being able to bring my boy to anatomy class but we worked with cadavers so I understood why."

service_dogs,fdqpjke,t1_fdqnwb2,1578672106.0,Didn't she admit cloud isn't a service dog because all of the issues she has. Like anxiety in public and resource guarding.
Epilepsy,fdpmie2,t3_emm39e,1578632839.0,"I don't believe you have to change your career plan at all.

service_dogs,fdligmv,t1_fdl5otr,1578524731.0,Police k9s live a majority of their lives working day in and day out while therapy dogs may only work once a month at times. These dogs live a majority of their lives being a pet that is probably the difference they are pointing out.
service_dogs,fdisl9a,t3_ellc0h,1578450110.0,Service dog channels don't really grow in popularity unless it's a professional trainer doing it. The only other reason why service dog channels grow is by posting fake service dog spottings or like arguments over being denied access. If you aren't doing it for views and the small view count wouldn't bother you I say go for it.

Epilepsy,fdfngy4,t3_ekxqno,1578365763.0,Yeah it really affects how my school schedule is and always puts me behind my classmates.
OpenDogTraining,fdff2xs,t1_fdfehcx,1578360203.0,Yeah usually trainers will leave the ecollar as backup and not use it unless needed as a fail safe but they are basically stating they have no backup.
OpenDogTraining,fdfc927,t1_fdep46r,1578358285.0,I think his issue is that there are so many risks to what he's doing. There is no backup system if for some reason he starts reacting badly.
