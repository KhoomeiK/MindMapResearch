SanJoseSharks,ffdbqks,t1_ffbg2is,1579817475.0,"A bit of a mix-up with the draft picks here.

The pick that was surrendered to Ottawa because of Karlsson's signing is the Sharks' 2021 2nd rounder (which would have been a first rounder had the Sharks made the finals last year). The deal with the 1st rounder was that, if the Sharks had missed the playoffs last season, the Senators would have gotten their 2019 1st rounder. Since they made the playoffs, Ottawa gets their 2020 1st rounder."

facepalm,feztupm,t1_fezrfdl,1579461586.0,"Thanks for the thoughtful reply. I imagine it must be difficult having a minority viewpoint in a largely right-wing region. And (at the risk of sounding a bit bigoted myself) people on the right tend to be more shallow minded about things, so I understand why you would need to paint in broad strokes to get the message across.

I don't think your viewpoint is wrong. Certainly, a lot of are saying similar things to what I've said, but coming from a place of racism and sexism themselves (and, for the most part, those people are white men). The left wing is associated with open mindedness, though, and I try to encourage people to continue being open minded."
facepalm,fezhnt9,t1_fey7yu0,1579457436.0,"Here's a great example right here. You don't like what this person is saying, so you jump straight to condescension and ridicule.

This obtuseness, this mean-spirited self righteousness, is something I've always associated with the right, but it seems to be coming increasingly from the left, which is disheartening. You take fundamentally good values, namely gender and race equality, and then weild them with malice."
facepalm,fezdobr,t1_feyo8du,1579456260.0,"I don't think anyone is claiming sexism towards men is anything close to sexism towards women. Just as nobody claims racism towards white people is anything close to racism against literally any other race.

Scratch that, actually. Lots of people (all being white men, of course) do make those claims. They're obviously wrong, and they deserve your derision. But comments like yours, and that of the person above who made the comment about ""red pill"" (a right-wing misappropriation of a term that perfectly demonstrates their tendency to miss the point by a mile), are indicative of a refusal to giving points of view even slightly different than your own the time of day.

You see people like me, critiquing a term, and you bunch all of it into one group. Anyone who disagrees must be sexist, or a bigot. Your opinions are immune to criticism. Easy to dismiss someone's if you can write them off without having to consider that they're saying."

facepalm,fey8p50,t1_fexv4ie,1579442178.0,"Someone in these comments made a parallel between the term ""mansplaining"" and ""crying like a woman"". Yes, men in general do this at a much higher rate. Just as women in general cry at a much higher rate. That doesn't change the fact that both are sexist terms."
facepalm,fey7pvf,t1_fexcddv,1579441878.0,"Ah I see. I thought this was satirical at first, but it looks like you post a lot of closed-minded, bigoted comments, believing yourself to be just because you're on the side of identity politics."

movies,fefji8r,t1_fe8m11n,1579057636.0,"I'm going to jump on you here because you made a claim that I was ""triggered"" by diversity in another post. I agree that Nyong'o deserved a nomination, and the film itself probably did too.

But to read my comment, and to take out of it that ""diversity is triggering"", highlights the point I was making.

The best comparison this year is between Joker (a very good film, in my opinion) and Watchmen (the best TV series of the year, in my opinion). Joker triggered the extreme left, I guess because it was about a disenfranchised white man? People keep throwing around the word ""incel"", but that term is intrinsically tied to misogyny, and Joker didn't have any implications about gender (or race, for that matter) at all. Watchmen triggered the extreme right, who were upset that it would dare cast white supremacists as villains (which highlights that, even when both sides are wrong, the right is so much more wrong than the left). Really, Watchmen masterfully wove issues of race with critiques of both right and left wing doctrines into a great superhero story.

What I'm getting at, and what apparently wasn't clear in my post, is that so much film criticism is based on an obvious agenda, rather than a fair assessment of film. And that's how we get to a journalist calling The Green Mile and Dallas Buyers club bad films, that were only lauded because they celebrate white people. This is a patently ridiculous argument."
movies,fefeo3h,t1_fefd859,1579054717.0,"It's not that diversity is a bad thing. That's not my point at all. It's that these critics' goal is to find flaws in Hollywood's inclusiveness, and to do so they make false claims about good movies that don't meet the quota."
