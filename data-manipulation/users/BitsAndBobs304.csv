 Also you may need to try a few different ones to find one that works for you, they each have different combination of strains of probiotics and use different prebiotics.  They also come in different forms, some are powder, some have tiny bottles with a cap that has powder and you mix them, etc. 
 The ones that work best for me have inulin and are also cheaper than most. 
Also experiment with taking it at different times, some instructions say to take it with meals, others  away from meals. 
You can also try psyllium.  
If it works not only youll notice energy and mental energy and happiness and willingness to do things, but also youll notice that when you dont take it for a few days, you'll start falling off again.
