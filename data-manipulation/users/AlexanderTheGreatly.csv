xboxone,ffmik6j,t1_ffmhslb,1580055240.0,Not even remotely accurate or funny though.
GamersRiseUp,ffmdfap,t1_ffm9pqt,1580052873.0,"Sadly true. It's not even the racism anymore. It's the lack of effort and repetitive fucking jokes that annoy me about the N-Word spam. 

Measurehead from Disco Elysium puts it right, when he calls the protagonist a ""BASIC RACIST""."

ihavesex,ff8qe2r,t1_ff8oq1c,1579691703.0,Couldn't really care less about the downvotes. It wasn't a brag and if insecure people want to interpret it that way then more power to them.
ihavesex,ff8n5cq,t1_ff89s9x,1579686891.0,Makes me feel a lot better about my 17. I often look at the Kyle's and think fuck they're getting laid way more than me. But if that's the case its a nice confidence boost.

GamersRiseUp,ff2j5hj,t1_ff29myg,1579508479.0,"Except /r/blackpeopletwitter did genuinely start banning white people last year and when the outrage was too great, they fell back on the old ""It was just a joke! Now you know how black people feel"" guilttrip. 

Still somehow not banned though. It's funny that isn't it?"
TittyDrop,feyiznv,t1_fexw9xz,1579446076.0,Sure.
HazbinHotel,fej7010,t1_fei4447,1579159519.0,I'm not sure what people liked about that movie. It was a borefest and by far the worst Tarantino movie since Jackie Brown. I felt like I was watching 2+ hours of an advert for the movie until the end where it finally picked up and then... Ended?
clevercomebacks,fej6v49,t1_fej6f9p,1579159348.0,"As a history teacher this is quite sad to read. I'd like to question what the ever living hell you've been taught. But then again, all throughout when I was in college, the few American Students that had the privilege of being educated in our wonderful education system almost universally commented on how biased and downright wrong History taught within the USA is.

I'll give you the Great Britain was a bad guy bit. Welcome to Europe. All countries were. It's kind of what we did here. 

We couldn't capture New Orleans because we were fighting the most powerful Army the world had ever seen, and didn't have time to waste on a backwater country that had tried to become relevant again in European politics and war. 

It wasn't luck at all. Waterloo was well fought, and beforehand, Napoleon had made a catastrophic mistake by invading our Russian Ally. That's not luck, that's just him being a terrible commander. 

And finally, the Kreigsmarine never stood a chance of invading the United Kingdom in WWII. The Luftwaffe had catastrophically failed in the Battle of Britain, and again failed to eliminate the British Army at Dunkirk. The Bismarck had been sunk, and the English Channel was firmly under Royal Navy control. The best the Germans could have hoped for is a white peace. But the suggestion that Nazi-Occupied Britain was anything more than a ridiculous fantasy is ludicrous."
clevercomebacks,fej4wgl,t1_fej1lq6,1579157025.0,"Lmao, how the ever living fuck are you claiming 1815 as a win? In 1812, the Americans tried to invade British Canada to help their old buddy Napoleon. They failed miserably, the British arrived, burned down the Whitehouse, forced the Presidency to flee as they sacked Washington, and definitively marked the end of American intervention in British Foreign affairs for over a hundred years.

eu4,fegvlik,t1_fegvgix,1579103522.0,That's good. Because I've only been playing on easy at the moment to learn mechanics but I'd like to move it up to Normal so I can experiment with things like that to get around certain mechanics.

eu4,fegreku,t1_fegnzoz,1579100772.0,So you could technically Diplo-Vassalize lots of different countries in Central Europe then? Since in 1455 the HRE and even France are relatively broken up.

StardewValley,fefx5au,t3_eopym7,1579068117.0,I love this. The background reminders me of *Innocent Life: A Futuristic Harvest Moon*. Which next to Stardew Valley is my personal favourite game of this genre.

Yes it's not a nice topic, but you're only making it more taboo than other dark things like murder or cannibalism because we as a society somehow class rape as the thing we can't joke about. I don't get it."
