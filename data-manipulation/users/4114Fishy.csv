LivestreamFail,ffppcgh,t1_ffph26u,1580101107.0,most rich people don't do that and that's exactly why they'r erich lmao
PlayTemtem,fflnae1,t1_ffl4j8k,1580041752.0,you can by running multiple instances of windows open and i think there's other ways but i haven't done it personally so i haven't looked into it much
PlayTemtem,ffk7j7e,t1_ffk2xpo,1580018234.0,yeah it wouldn't happen if you coul dhave multiple save files though
PlayTemtem,ffk2qem,t1_ffk1t4g,1580013995.0,yeah i made a 2nd account with family sharing to play with a friend and the account was in the 360ks
EscapefromTarkov,ffk0aiv,t1_ffjzgqt,1580011900.0,that's how pubg does voip too
LivestreamFail,ffjv3iq,t1_ffjpv3a,1580007776.0,then that becomes a tic too genius she's talked about it lmao
EscapefromTarkov,ffjbdur,t1_ffjb05b,1579994748.0,it'll probably be a toggle like how PUBG does voip
videos,ffebj49,t1_ffea7mv,1579842190.0,they were more than likely just joking around lol
LivestreamFail,ffbk0ht,t1_ff9jsqk,1579768959.0,ya but you can make a lot more on twitch with less viewers bc of twitch prime
LivestreamFail,ffax6im,t1_ffauidd,1579746564.0,aqua jet has priority and 100% hit rate
LivestreamFail,ffatckq,t3_esjclk,1579744023.0,lmao why go for super effective over 100% hit rate as a level 100 mon that's such a monkey move tbh
WTF,ff7bk6b,t1_ff6oz6e,1579645615.0,then it'd be an amazing chair
PlayTemtem,ff78esf,t1_ff62rh5,1579643155.0,nightmare is also fixed damage too
LivestreamFail,ff58pla,t1_ff570ep,1579583567.0,"if I was trying to defend the cat abuser i would've commented on that instead of just the claws lol but i guess i could see how it was interpreted that way. my cat only does it with belly scratches and while most cats hate having their belly touched at all, she loves it and only kicks at my arm sometimes from what i assume is instincts bc she immediately stops when she realizes what she's doing"
LivestreamFail,ff56sj4,t1_ff54yj9,1579581871.0,ye but plenty of caretakers of big cats like tigers or lions always talk about how much more control they have over their claws compared to house cats
LivestreamFail,ff54h6d,t1_ff5416x,1579579976.0,I dunno why i got downvoted it's simply true. Cats are pretty bad at controlling their claws compared to the big wild cats. I get happy back claws from my cat while petting her belly all the time even though she loves the belly rubs she's just bad at controlling her claws.
LivestreamFail,ff50uor,t1_ff2u7ya,1579577209.0,"that actually caught me so off guard i said what the fuck outloud, amazing"
LivestreamFail,ff4yu0a,t3_ermd52,1579575740.0,lmao i bet that dude instantly reported and didn't even watch the replay
LivestreamFail,ff4qu0k,t1_ff2vioq,1579570235.0,you don't need to do any of that to have fun in tarkov tbh and for ammo charts it's 1 or 2 bullets that are good for each gun

LivestreamFail,ff1pyhn,t1_ff1k8np,1579483589.0,meanwhile he's probably trying to slide into like 15 different girls dms but has no problem with that but the second a girl does it it's a problem and he wants nothing to do with her lmao amazing
pathofexile,ff1jq9i,t1_ff1hhch,1579480290.0,yup that's what i had for my icicle miner and it increased my damage so much but i rip'd the build because i didn't know metamorphs couldn't be frozen which really sucks
LivestreamFail,ff16vtq,t1_ff0nb6q,1579475832.0,maybe if you're extremely unhealthy but pretty much every side effect of a lack of sleep is only temporary
pathofexile,fezllbx,t1_fez0ex3,1579458657.0,doesn't almost everyone use skitterbots?
LivestreamFail,fezgh86,t1_feyiw2i,1579457098.0,what the fuck LMAO
SubredditDrama,fewnriw,t1_fewno11,1579416088.0,"it was an inappropriate joke between him and a friend, eminem has some lyrics you could say are homophobic but he is extremely good friends with elton john and even got him a diamond encrusted cock ring as a gift to celebrate their marriage lol not everything is so black and white"
SubredditDrama,fes6q3x,t1_feryt2b,1579361986.0,he was a baby but he was never homophobic or anything. he just likes acting stupid for his stream
SubredditDrama,fes65u3,t1_ferzx1x,1579361861.0,"except it was her saying it, none of your pictures are showing those streamers saying any of it"
LivestreamFail,feojvcy,t1_feojpna,1579301162.0,i mean sometimes arranged marriages work out well it doesn't mean they're a good idea lol but in most cases that's what people should do
LivestreamFail,feohqcr,t1_femyrdk,1579300387.0,that's a terrible idea. living together is a whole different level from just hanging out together in person. you shuold always live with someone for 6+ months before you actually marry them. i'm sure it'll work out for them because they both seem to have their shit set straight but it can break a lot of couples up
LivestreamFail,feocxbr,t1_feo8o4a,1579298369.0,"and they would've taken their holidays off to celebrate with their family but also did not, it doesn't matter the holiday lmao"
pathofexile,feghvrj,t1_feggrnz,1579093266.0,that wouldn't even be worth the effort lol
technology,fe95v0h,t1_fe92d9l,1578934589.0,it wasn't a windows store app update you have to have the latest version of windows to use the xbox app
technology,fe8w3pi,t1_fe8vsy7,1578931672.0,aren't those are mostly security updates? to keep your pc protected. when i had to update my windows to use the xbox game app i was over a year behind even though i get updates every week
technology,fe8u807,t1_fe8t7k4,1578930961.0,"yup the upgrade caused me so many issues that i thought win 10 was garbage but a fresh install fixed everything and it's just so much better than 7 imo, there's just way too many qol upgrades that i wouldn't be able to go back to 7"
leagueoflegends,fe7kz5h,t1_fe6xoza,1578915957.0,i don't actually play or like aphelios but lucian died for no reason there
leagueoflegends,fe7bc57,t1_fe7aypu,1578912442.0,he lost over half his health by canceling his autos then walking away instead of just pressing either e or w to kill it
leagueoflegends,fe6nwlv,t1_fe66gec,1578897507.0,"lmao you say this with both a qiyana and talon flair, amazing"
leagueoflegends,fe6neor,t1_fe5xt97,1578896957.0,uhh lucian did literally nothing if he just auto w auto'd it he would've been fine but he walked through it like a monkey lol
LivestreamFail,fe3kniq,t1_fe1bmni,1578850175.0,literally everything every streamer does that has an audience is to bait donations/subs lmao
Steam,fe2lobz,t1_fe1jpjd,1578840071.0,EA is nothing like a cosmetic mtx though lmao that's not comparable at all
leagueoflegends,fdvx8od,t1_fdv48bn,1578752746.0,giving her back aoe would just improve her jungle though lol
LivestreamFail,fdrsost,t1_fdriev8,1578689106.0,"depending on how it's coded, yeah it could be. In league crit chance is also pseudo random, so when you don't crit while having crit chance your chance keeps going up until you do crit then it resets to the default value. if SA did do pseudo random for gambling, it would be more likely that it would've landed on black since there were 3 reds previously so it'd be less likely to get either of those 3."
LivestreamFail,fdr15wy,t1_fdpxw6x,1578678063.0,chat does* streamers do it because chat freaks out with long delays
LivestreamFail,fdpbfcc,t1_fdp9qv6,1578624435.0,didn't she delete the vod? whereas steven didn't? so it has nothing to do with their sex lmao
LivestreamFail,fdmaq98,t1_fdm4zoc,1578544111.0,"i thought the same thing and i figured i'd give one of the games a shot to see why they're so popular so i dl'd the sfw version of sakura dungeon and there was actually a decent story+gameplay to it tbh, it wouldn't surprise me if this one's story was decent but it's probably more submissive girls or w/e to cater to weebs"
LivestreamFail,fdktb9s,t1_fdkos2k,1578510712.0,his name isn't english lol
LivestreamFail,fdkpfz6,t1_fdkgsp2,1578508414.0,"i see you've never watched an iwd stream lmao this team is either going to win every game or hard tilt off the face of the earth. adrian and hai are exceptions but there's 3 hard tilters on their team. tilting isn't necessarily flaming there's things like soft inting or just generally playing like garbage when you're tilted, did you not see the way tyler reacted the second he left the call in twitch rivals? he flamed the fuck out of his support to his chat."
LivestreamFail,fdj5owh,t1_fdj49vl,1578459157.0,this isn't boomer at all this is literally just a dad joke lmao
aww,fdifjn8,t1_fdi194l,1578441760.0,"cats usually like places with a wider or multiple exits though, that's why they don't really like actual cubbies if you buy it for them, unless they have multiple exits."
LivestreamFail,fdg40ky,t1_fdg2oc2,1578379166.0,"if you've put in 10k games and you're trying to climb then you're just not good at the game, it's that simple. if you've played 10k normals then it really doesn't matter since you weren't playing to improve but that amount of time to only be top 5% is really low. the person they're talking about here is steven who's put in like 10k ranked games which means he hasn't improved in years of playing league lol i used to watch him mindlessly grind it without any improvement at all but i don't watch him anymore"
LivestreamFail,fdg0h16,t1_fdfzw4b,1578375582.0,5% really isn't that high if you've put in that amount of time

LivestreamFail,fd78l1n,t1_fd746x5,1578200844.0,you'd think someone who plays wow would understand the difference in skill a proper rotation can make lol...
LivestreamFail,fd78358,t1_fd6u66g,1578200661.0,yeah except it'd be like half the youtubers now that have custom lobbies
aww,fd6s9t7,t1_fd6pg63,1578195087.0,"you're right, but it still wouldn't be a carnivore though bc that's like saying you're a vegetarian on the days you don't eat meat"

GamePhysics,fd1znxh,t1_fd1uumo,1578139331.0,wow it's almost like you just mentioned games made by AAA developers who have full studios and comparing it to a studio that had no people in it at the beginning and is nowhere near AAA lmao

pathofexile,fd054qw,t1_fd047gk,1578113767.0,no its not its own damage that matters its your other swords damage that matters since it doubles that swords damage. he's talking nonsense because you're obviously not going to have a shit tier offhand if you have a weapon worth more than 20 ex as your main hand lmao
pathofexile,fd04v5r,t1_fd03a8p,1578113657.0,i think you're not understanding the way it calculates the damage https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejY9RE3Qdkk have you seen dan's vid on it? he explains it well and why it's the BiS for dual wielding swords and will be for a long time
pathofexile,fczytl4,t1_fczxizz,1578110975.0,"it doesn't copy your other weapon it makes 2 copies of you that do 50% of your damage, which essentially doubles your damage."

AskReddit,fcu7smq,t1_fcu6uth,1577974591.0,yeah that's probably something you should mention to someone you're going to be with otherwise they might make some stupid assumptions when they get hit in the face with some tiddy milk
pathofexile,fcu78rh,t1_fcu52s8,1577974228.0,you can suggest but not directly edit

PublicFreakout,fct16oc,t1_fcszvo2,1577930212.0,or maybe it's thanks to racists for even making these words in the first place? lol great job trying to put the blame elsewhere
PublicFreakout,fcsz8i4,t1_fcsxs69,1577928816.0,hmm it's almost like it's much different coming from a friend or someone who is a part of said slur instead of just some random person who isn't related to the slur at all lmao great comparison genius
AskReddit,fcsynyu,t1_fcsd0y2,1577928415.0,doesn't have a serious tag so most things are probably going to be jokes

todayilearned,fcsvqa6,t1_fcssy0t,1577926328.0,lmao there's no way they put kids on something like sniping it wasn't call of duty it was war and sniping actually took a lot of skill

pathofexile,fcldcld,t3_ehow2b,1577745183.0,"my friend got trapped in prison that way, he had to log out bc he had no portal scrolls on him as this was near the beginning of the league. 10/10 would witness again"
DotA2,fcl88o9,t1_fcl70q4,1577741938.0,maybe to you but for a team where you have a soul crushing asshole on your team it would definitely not be worth it. i'm not saying sumail is but there's been teams in pretty much every game that have been destroyed/potential nowhere near reachable because of one person on the team constantly lowering everyone else's morale with their assholery
