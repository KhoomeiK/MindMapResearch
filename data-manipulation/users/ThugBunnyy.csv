expats,fe6py1l,t1_fe6ntaj,1578899951.0,"Denmark is wonderful. A lot of racist people there too though. Especially towards muslims. 

I hope it will get better. Not gonna give up after 7 months, but I wish I could keep a more positive outlook. And yes, at least I have my little family here. That is true. 

Idk about fitting in. My father is Pakistan actually. Definitely don't have a typical Scandinavian look. Have also experienced racism in my own country. People think I'm middle eastern because of my hair and eyes. So far, I haven't experienced anything here yet.

If you dislike it so much in the Netherlands, have you considered relocating to maybe the UK? A LOT of pakistanis and Indians in England. I have family there and they all love it there."
expats,fe6pk8a,t1_fe5xm7i,1578899469.0,"You know, I thought it would be easier to make friends here. My bf has a big friend circle. Close friends that he grew up with, now with gf's/bf's added to the mix. Somehow thought they'd ""take me in"". Last party we went to, I sat on a chair while they all spoke frisian (local dialect).. Ended up leaving after an hour and a half because it was just plain awkward and uncomfortable. Made me realize that it's gonna be a lot harder than I thought. I have to make my own friends somehow... Hopefully that will be possible once I can use my degree for a good job. 

Never expected things to just fall into my lap. But this isn't what I expected either. 

Thank you for your kind words."

expats,fe5ccog,t3_enssu8,1578867654.0,"I'm so so sorry you feel this way. And more so for the racism you experience. I'm a newcomer in the Netherlands, from Scandinavia. I feel your pain. I've been here 7 months and I also feel really lonely. I'm not even actually alone. I have my bf, 2 kids and our dog. But I feel extremely lonely here. 

I have a bachelor degree in nursing from my own country and a great career in my own country, but I can't use it here till I pass a language test at level B1, currently doing A1. I'm cleaning at a school and attending language classes where I've met a wonderful lady from Scotland. I feel a great deal of sadness when I think about my old job (I miss it and my co workers too). Here I'm just a nobody. 

My bf has his whole life here, work, friends, family etc.. But I don't really feel a part of it tbh. I don't speak Dutch, I understand a bit but not enough to feel like I'm part of any conversations when at social gatherings. 

Some days when I'm down, I wish I could go back to Denmark. But giving up after 7 months seems a bit quick. I want to believe that things are gonna get better, that I didn't just leave everything behind for nothing.

Which part of the NL are you in? Myself, in friesland."

expats,fdddl7e,t3_eksdn0,1578307243.0,"Props to you for learning so quick! But I can relate. I've been here for 6 months and also struggling. I have a bachelor's degree in nursing from a Scandinavian country, I can't register it with BIG untill I pass B1 (I have my A1 exam this month, still a long way to go). 

I got a job cleaning, figured I could hear more Dutch around the other cleaners but we work alone. I feel like I'm never gonna learn.. I applied for a job at a nursing home instead and have to go set up a contract this thursday. Hope it will help increase my Dutch speaking. My problem is speaking it. I can read and understand it pretty well. 6 hours of classes a week is pretty much the only Dutch practice for me, which just doesn't cut it.
