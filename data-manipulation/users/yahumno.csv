Some good points for your request:

Hashimotos,fh8dww8,t3_f1qo75,1581357677.0,"You doctor isn't listening to you. You are considering leaving your job for health reasons.

I was on reduced work hours for over a year, while I dealt with getting my health in check. I also do not travel for work like I used to. You have to find the balance that works for you."
CanadianForces,fh80nyu,t1_fh7ux1c,1581349377.0,"Agreed. Over 26 years in the military (mix of Army and Air Force).  The suggestions of this Tiger Team are out to lunch. They seem to forget that it took years for women to be taken seriously in the military. I still remember one of my bosses when I was a Cpl, they firmly believed that women belonged at home.

First off, I'm trying to remember the last time I work my DEU skirt. I was ecstatic when the ""male cut"" pants became an option. Actual comfortable pants that didn't make everyone look like they are pregnant.

As far as my medals go, I wear them proudly, since you know, I earned them.

I could go on, but I firmly agree that this Tiger Team has trivialized everything women in the CAF have worked for, to be treated as equals. Ugh."
Winnipeg,fh5un1n,t3_f1gpxw,1581292475.0,"I have a very large but friendly dog. Luckily, she is not phased by other dogs, even the crazy off leash neighbourhood chihuahuas.

I have had leash reactive dogs in the past and it still bothers me to no end when people have their dogs off leash where it isn't allowed. Part of being a responsible pet owner is knowing how they react and exposing them to what should be safe environments. Training goes a long way, but is not an excuse for other owners to be irresponsible. 

Also, people who don't pick up their dog's poop deserve to step in it."
Hashimotos,fh5cozl,t3_f1ewpp,1581287564.0,"I have tinnitus  but I also am hard of hearing, which kind of go hand in hand."
aww,fh57uka,t3_f1db4g,1581285899.0,Now this is a Deaf baby video that I can aww about. No language deprivation for this one.

I love being Canadian. Lots of languages and different kinds of food."
rheumatoid,fh2npn6,t1_fh1whre,1581258461.0,"Inflammation can cause numbness. I get numb hands and had the nerve testing done. This is what I was told after my testing, that the numbness was due to inflammation."
rheumatoid,fh2nj6h,t3_f13waj,1581258383.0,"I have been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis (without skin involvement).

The only blood work that was elevated was my C-Reactive Protein (6.0 when the reference range was 0 to 4). This is a marker for general inflammation. 

Is your pain symmetrical? Do you get any swelling?

There are more types of inflammatory arthritis than just RA, but they tend to be harder to diagnose. I ended up having a bone scan and MRIs to diagnose my arthritis (along with mgt symptoms)."

This fellow Canadian is wishing you to stay safe and healthy."
rheumatoid,fh1znpu,t1_fh1vrzr,1581229260.0,Maybe it is dose based?
rheumatoid,fgzl8g9,t1_fgzjrgr,1581195173.0,"I checked with my pharmacist first for any interactions/their opinion. They said that it was safe to try, but there hasn't really been any studies in regards to low dose methotrexate used in autoimmune diseases."

I used Mucinex DM to help the exhaustion. 

I would take one with my injection at dinner time and one before bed.
