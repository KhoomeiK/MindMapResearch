""Some people like her"" because everyone knows her name, that's just statistically likely not a testament to her popularity. The vast majority of people who know who she is dislike her, that's the truth.

>Sanders has been in politics longer than anyone. The fact that he was a 'no name' is not on Clinton. The fact that he could not sway people of the Dem party to support him is not on Clinton.

Unlike most, Sanders didn't enter politics to build a name for himself, but yeah, shame on Sanders for not being the spouse of a past President and having to actively spend a couple of years building the largest grassroots movement in history.

Out of 138 million. If you're 2.1% more popular than a steaming pile of shit that's an indictment of your reputation lol.
