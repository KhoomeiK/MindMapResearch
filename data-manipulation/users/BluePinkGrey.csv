We never see her parents, and it's not clear what happened to them. Back when Scorpia's grandfather was around, the Heart of Etheria wasn't active because it was missing She-Ra. Now, it's missing Scorpia."

QContent,ffgqkas,t1_ffeh2ke,1579912529.0,"Most of the story comes from interpersonal relationships and character struggles/growth. Yay is a good character specifically because the problems characters encounter can’t be solved with omnipotent AI superpowers.

Martin needs to grow as a person, Dora needs to learn to balance work and leisure, Faye is working to overcome alcoholism and run a robot repair shop, Bubbles is learning to grow and relate to other people after her traumatic experiences, May is learning to have friends and overcome her anti-social tendencies, and Roko is learning how to actually do good for the world.

There are some problems that Yay would be suited to fix (like the issues with May’s body), but so could Hannelore, whose parents are literal billionaires, or even Sven, who’s certainly well-off."

questionablecontent,ff58isy,t1_ff52z1h,1579583396.0,"As someone who has dysphoria, I can say that having control over my body & being able to change it is actually something that helps reduce the dysphoria. 

A big part of dysphoria is feeling trapped in a situation which it feels like you have no control over, and cannot change. With gender dysphoria, this manifests as having a body that doesn’t match with your identified gender. That’s one of the reasons transitioning helps so many people - it gives them control over their body. 

Even if the changes don’t exactly match a person’s expectations, they still make the person’s body better match their sense of self, in large part because they chose those changes."

trashy,fejdspj,t3_eoerpk,1579169127.0,"I'm horrified by some of the stories I've read about apartments, and I gotta say I consider myself pretty lucky. I've read tons of stories about people living in absolutely terrible conditions, for 2 or 3 times the amount of rent that I pay. I've seen horror stories about terrible black mold, about utterly disgusting infestations of insects, about dilapidated structures, and of course there's this post about an apartment with a fake thermostat. 

I pay half of the $760 rent for a two-bedroom apartment. My roommate and I have a working thermostat; we've had zero issues with insects; we have a kitchen with a dishwasher; and as far as I can tell, there aren't any issues with VOCs in the apartment. My room isn't huge but it's not cramped either. There are multiple restaurants, a grocery store, a pharmacy, and a dentists' office in walking distance. The apartment itself has a well-cared-for courtyard with massive trees, a pool, grass, and an artificial stream (although that does tend to break frequently). The apartment building has a front office that's staffed during normal business hours, and package theft is nonexistent because the front office saves the package until you go down to pick it up. 

Could the apartment be nicer? Sure. It's not fancy, but it's clean, practical, and livable. 

I guess my only question is: Why isn't it like this everywhere? Why are there so many places with housing that's both shitty and expensive?"

educationalgifs,fe6w692,t1_fe34zae,1578906563.0,"Neutron stars are heavy bois. Basically, once a star’s core is converted to iron it can no longer fuse. This causes the core to cool. As it cools, it becomes denser. This increases the force of gravity, which accelerated the process, causing the core to collapse in on itself violently. This squishes the core so much that the spaces between the atoms are removed, and nuclei get pressed up against each other. This makes the neutron star billions of times denser than regular matter. The end result is the entire mass of the sun (sometimes as high as 1.5 times the mass of the sun) squished into a ball just 16km across or so.

Even though they’re small, they’re so hot and bright that we can still see them."
