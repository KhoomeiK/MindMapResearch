Edit: ffs, I’m not being anti-breeder. Who disagrees that rescues and shelters need money to operate?!?"
dogs,ff3crt8,t1_ff3a9i6,1579538559.0,"No, that makes sense! Ours is a raised deck so it is fenced in except for the stairs, but if yours isn’t that would make it impossible.

Good luck! Hope it works. Our dog gets confused when we haven’t shovelled the snow off the deck and thinks it’s okay to pee there."
dogs,ff39o56,t1_ff38sxc,1579536953.0,"My vet would disagree with a one hour walk for a medium-to-large breed three month old puppy. OP, check with yours before you attempt it."
dogs,ff39ggw,t3_ere0m6,1579536817.0,"Can you gate off the deck? If so, take her to the top of the stairs when she goes out and close the gate. Reward when she goes in the grass."
dogs,ff2xwgi,t1_ff1jv67,1579528130.0,The difference is that as far as I’m aware most fostered dogs don’t end up back in the shelter - they go from a home to their forever home. Fostering is an overall positive for the dog. Is being adopted and then returned? I suppose it depends on the dog and the temporary home.
dogs,ff2xksz,t1_ff2p5ky,1579527829.0,"> Letting the dog loose to fend for itself shouldn't be one of them.

Yes. It’s really upsetting that people even consider this an option for domesticated animals."
ThunderBay,feyf2zz,t1_fexl4la,1579444639.0,"I’ve read both, and while both are worthwhile Seven Fallen Feathers should be required reading for Thunder Bay residents."
ThunderBay,fev6ofj,t1_fesz3xl,1579393733.0,Do it! A lot of people on our street do and they always take it. Just make sure that you use two bins and separate paper vs plastic.
ThunderBay,fes7uyf,t1_fer3k94,1579362290.0,"We put ours out in blue recycling bins, bagless, and they take it ;)"
dogs,fekj4t3,t1_fek8nl8,1579201125.0,My dog is a rescue so I always reassure myself that it’s better than where he was. Maybe consider a shelter dog or a rescue if that’s a big factor in what’s holding you back!
dogs,feigiz6,t3_ep5dxl,1579138004.0,I felt so connected to our puppy and was so ready to have a dog that I didn’t experience puppy blues. I was surprised the first time I read about it! He honestly was and is an utter joy.
dogs,fefi69r,t1_fefepbe,1579056827.0,"We will have to, because I don’t think saying that flying is better than driving is a vehement disagreement either.

Again, I don’t think people should recreationally fly with their pets, but I don’t see the sense in fearmongering when it comes to the risk of a pet flying cargo either. A 0.009% chance of something happening is extremely low."
dogs,fefbdpd,t1_fef9xg4,1579052594.0,"> that report only counts American-based airlines

Yes, but I’d bet that’s where the majority of these deaths have happened in the western world as well. 

From the link you’ve provided, “The HSUS recommends that you weigh all the risks when deciding whether to transport your pet by airplane.” and “While most animals flown in the cargo area of airplanes are fine, you should be aware that some animals are killed, injured or lost on commercial flights each year.” That’s hardly a vehement disagreement."
dogs,fef8euv,t1_fef75t3,1579050628.0,"I wouldn’t recommend flying a dog several times a year, but I dislike when people spread misinformation about the risk of flying. It’s likely less dangerous than driving with a dog, which is something people do everyday."
dogs,fef3cdo,t1_feet9b6,1579047203.0,"> the statistics on the amount of dogs who die in baggage is horrifying.

This isn’t actually true. You hear about the horror stories because there’s no story in a dog flying with no problems. 

“ Records show that across all airlines from 2015 through 2017, there were 151 animal-related incidents — 85 deaths, 62 injuries, and four lost animals — out of about 1.57 million animals transported”

That’s approximately 0.009%.

ThunderBay,fef0zou,t1_fe5jqpb,1579045628.0,We live in a nice PA neighbourhood and my husband’s car window was smashed in the spring.
dogs,febx0gi,t3_eocsko,1578963688.0,"There’s a Mr Rogers story that I find helpful. It happened when he was a boy and would see scary things on the news: “My mother would say to me, ‘Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.’ To this day, especially in times of disaster, I remember my mother’s words, and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers — so many caring people in this world.”

When I come across something like yours, I look for the helpers - usually dog rescues - and try to donate to them if I have the means. That makes me feel a little better."
dogs,feb7xpv,t1_feaby2x,1578956197.0,It’s crazy to me that you can get a dog for less than the price of a Starbucks latte.
dogs,feb72db,t1_feax3q4,1578956016.0,"Interesting. I’m in Canada and that’s not the case here because we don’t really have the overpopulation problem some US states do. I’ve never seen a dog’s fee reduced, though the shelters occasionally do that with cats."
dogs,fe80rvf,t3_eo3sk2,1578921079.0,"It’s about $300 - $400 on average for a dog from a shelter or rescue where I am, but in major cities in my province I’ve seen it be as high as $750. Money very well spent though! I think that overall our rescues do a wonderful job."
dogs,fdzoxvq,t1_fdy946s,1578792595.0,">  I already knew Togo didn't die during the Nome serum run.

We watched it tonight and I only knew that because I read it here earlier this afternoon. Before they made this movie I’d never heard of Togo, but I’m also Canadian so it’s not part of our history."
dogs,fdznrwv,t3_enfqk7,1578792148.0,"Hashbrown. We got him from the Dominican and the resort we were staying at when we met him mislabeled hashbrowns as “Papa Hans Brown”, which we found hilarious. We didn’t go there intending to get a dog, but as it became a possibility I suggested that we could name him Papa Hans Brown if we did (we call him by both names, but Hashbrown in public)."
