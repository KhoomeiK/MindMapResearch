Military,feuft1v,t1_fetu2us,1579386078.0,"What is false is that it was started by Putin. You claim he had no valid reason but the Eastern part of Ukraine is ethnic Russian with strong ties to Russia so he would likely disagree.  The rest of what you say is true but as I explaned above, the fighting between Eastern and Western Ukraine began before all of that and it started when Western Ukraine neo-nazi groups supported by the new government began attacking Russian Speaking Ukrainians who were living in Western cities as well as in Eastern Ukraine. It escalated from there."
Military,feublx4,t1_fetvb56,1579384984.0,"It is a civil war between Russian speaking Ukrainians in the East and Ukrainian-speaking Ukrainians in the West.  The Eastern Ukrainians were pro-communist during WWII and consist of a large number of ethnic Russians. They have strong historical and ethnic ties to Russia.  The Western Ukrainians were part of Poland and as such were pro-Nazi during WWII and many of the groups involved in the overthrow of the Yanukovych government still are.

The Eastern Ukrainians rejected the overthrow of the Yanukovych government by the Western Ukrainians.  The Eastern Ukrainians began fighting the Western Ukrainians after the government was overthrown and the new government outlawed the use of Russian in the Ukraine and Western Ukrainian neo-Nazi groups began attacking Russian speaking Ukrainians in both Western and the Eastern parts of the Ukraine. This fighting escalated and continued to escalate to what we see today. 

Is Russia supplying weapons and troops to the Eastern Ukrainians? No doubt they are. Did they take back Crimea? Yep. But to say Putin started it is bullshit.  He reacted to and took advantage of the situation, the same as we would do."
