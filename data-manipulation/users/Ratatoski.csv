relationship_advice,ffhgbe9,t3_ete1ig,1579934017.0,"Your gf is trying to threaten and coerce you into performing oral sex on her knowing very well that someone forced you to do this as a kid. Knowing you have outright panic attacks from even trying. Why? Because she likes oral. It's concerning to me that you did not immediately recognize this as a dealbreaker for *you*. 

To hell with her needs and ""oral is common"". This is about trauma and she knows it. Don't let her become another abuser. 

Find a good therapist and work through some additional layers. It's tough but a blessing once it's done. 

From the bottom of my heart - good luck,  and don't let people abuse you just because you let them close."
relationship_advice,ffhf9kh,t3_etixf7,1579932793.0,Lots of useful advice here already. Just adding a little anecdote. I've usually been high libido throughout life and seen a lot through that lens. Last year ot two it's taken a dive and when it's a zero the world (and the thought of sex) looks very different. Sex becomes a weird and slightly gross activity and even though I remember how much I lusted after it I can't for the life of me feel the same. It's a very sobering experience remembering the times my SO has not been in the mood.
relationship_advice,ffheltz,t3_et8iub,1579932058.0,"Two issues here is a problem:


- her sense of self needs years if work in therapy, and I'm not joking. Rewiring from having your worth tied to looks and popularity to a healthier mindset takes a lot of work, and you have to want it and be open to an emotionally difficult journey. 


- actively trying to hurt people while smiling to their face. This is more concerning. What if she gets in her head that you flirt with a colleague at work? What if she thinks that someone is just being difficult and faking a nut allergy? Right now this is how she acts when everybody is on her side, but what happens once she gets more pushback? Her friend deserves to know,  but do you think your fiancee will take responsibility once shit hits the fan?

Is she the kind who will be demanding to service staff or go out of her way to hurt a restaurants reputation for a perceived fault against her? 

What happens if she gets alopecia and loses patches of her hair?"

A slow tour north along the coast is a great idea. Just make sure to take the smaller scenic routes marked with a brown flower sign. Slower but worth it! My favourite part of the country is the archipelago between Misterhult and Loftahammar. Renting a kayak or taking a tour boat will be worth it if you enjoy nature. 

Stockholm has a lot of beautiful parts for a capital. To crowded for my taste though :)"

I would personally not be interested in someone who isn't into me. Her falling in love with someone new should be a fast track to loss of attraction.

Dude. Trying to save people by loving them is a shortcut to being abused. I learnt that the hard way. Along with many thousands of others. A first requirement on a SO is that they respect you and that they pull their own weight. 

It's like a car. You wouldn't likely buy an old Toyota Corolla that's been crashed so bad it has a permanently crooked frame. That has no service history and where the seat heater is permanently enabled and burning your ass.

Gah! Some people are evil assholes trying to break down their partners self worth so they can control them. Others are terribly immature and hurt others deeply without even thinking about it. In any case this is unacceptable behaviour even for a teen or 20-something. 

>Iâ€™m pathetic for accepting that I know. Itâ€™s just hard to see in the moment. I just always think heâ€™s probably right. It sounds really sad admitting that

Not pathetic. We let our SO's in through our defenses assuming that they would not hurt us. You are trusting,  looking for the best in people and perhaps have a few insecurities. Be kind to yourself.

>My best friend has always told me that itâ€™s obvious I love him way more than he loves me and I think she might be right. 

Now you have both our outside perspective. And a far more well informed perspective from your friend. Seems like s/he has your back, trust your friend."

Yeah I don't actually have an issue with sex work existing as an option for those who enjoy it or are indifferent. What I have an issue with is that when it exists it becomes an option people may be forced into who will be miserable.

I'm a monogamous guy who wants to have sex as an expression of love and intimacy. Not matter if it's vanilla or the adventurous kind. I've never done random consensual hookups either. 

As an active sex worker it's also in your interest to claim to the exception to the norm. But once you quit and still say ""I liked my work"" it holds weight. 

Had a look at your post history and I wish you all the best!"

But escorts wouldn't work for me. As kinky as I can be sex is about intimacy and love for me. I would'nt be able to have sex with someone I know for a fact is not into it, only doing it for the money. Even if it is a paid service at that point it would feel rapey for me. Huge turnoff."

Remember that when you are seeing a boundary with someone you are not being mean,  you are trying to tell them what you need from them to be able to have them in your life. And there are a lot of boundaries that needs to be set here. 

Do you want kids? Because in your current state of the relationship that would be the worst possible decision. A few years of therapy for her (and you) to improve things + a bunch of years to make sure it sticks would be necessary. Which would put your ages into problematic territory for having kids."
relationship_advice,fdayg6p,t3_ekct56,1578251785.0,"Your gf is obviously raised with partners telling each others everything and when you don't she feels that you are disrespecting the relationship. It seems to make her feel that you value her more on the level of an acquaintance (in this regard). If course she will be hurt. 

But. 

If your friend trusted you with sensitive information you shouldn't give it up. You should be *able* to give it up being 100% sure that she wouldn't in a million years betray that trust. You don't seem to have that trust which is a little concerning. But in principle it would be wrong to tell your friends secret (even if many trust their partner with others secrets). 

>She then threatened to call his wife, which I said was insane.

Lol.  This is hilarious.  And say what? ""Hey my husband won't betray your husband's trust. Can you fill me in on all the juicy bits of your current misery?""

Come to think of it your gf makes herself look bad here"
relationship_advice,fdaw51t,t3_ekboii,1578251030.0,"I read through the thread and I think you have to change your mindset here. You had a good future planned with values that seems to deviate a little from your familys culture. Seems like you were planning to get educated, rule your own life and eventually marry out of love. 

You just discovered that no one else had the same plan for you. Your parents still think they rule your life and in their culture you are being a bit of an asshole here for resisting them. 

The situation forces your hand. You need to see things as they are, not how you wanted and had planned. You can try to express your utmost respect to your parents but that you unfortunately cannot go through with this. But you also need to find a backup plan fast as heck.

No matter what you do your cousin will likely be in a poor situation. I suspect that even if you marry her to protect her it will be trouble when no children are born + a 20 something divorced girl is likely not something that will make the family happy either. If you dont marry her she will be married to someone else. 

Seems like best you can do is to go abroad to finish your education.  Or at least move out of home. Is it possible to live independently and finish your studies while working part time? It may take longer but being independent may be worth it. 

Give some real thought to how far you can stretch the bond with family without breaking it. You don't want to be disowned for defying family.

Is it possible to speak to your parents in this manner without offending them: ""Father, mother. I want to thank you for everything you have done for me. I know you want what is best for me and you have always taken care of me. This is very valuable to me and you have given me a fabulous start in life. In the future it will be my honour to provide for you. But to do that I need to focus on my education so I can find good work. I do not wish to be distracted with marriage to a baby sister. It is already creating problems for our family. A big dowry is nice but a one time thing. If I finish my education without distractions I can get good grades and find a job that pays well every month for the rest of my life"""

I've been with my wife for soon 20 years and the dynamic has a lot of similarities. I want you to know that things do not fix themselves.  You have to take responsibility for your happiness and the sooner you do the less mess. There are a lot of boundaries to set here.

Expect things to get both worse and a little better at the same time. She seems to rely on some black/white thinking and it's possible that you have ""ruined her life"" if you dont do everything the way she wants it. Honestly it's a rather big risk that she will feel betrayed enough to want to end things. Welcome it in that case. But it may also be the last shot at getting things working better. Going further down the current road will just create a burnt out brain and stress issues with your body."

Get a tattoo if you want to. But I'd not get my first tattoo on the hand. Visible tattoos close a lot of options. I promise you that another two decades passes really fast and you will not be the same person by then. But you'll have a weird smudge on your hand that may keep you from getting better jobs to provide for your kids.

You can have a full body suit and still keep it hidden in formal clothes, but hands and face are a choice that affects the upcoming 70 years a lot."
