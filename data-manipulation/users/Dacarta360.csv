Did I scare you?"
Showerthoughts,fc1mpb6,t1_fc1me7j,1577323400.0,U too
Showerthoughts,fc1mmpq,t1_fc14s84,1577323339.0,"Well there could be rich resources on mars. Or there couldn't be. Either way, both exploring the entire ocean is the equivalency of walking on all planets. Since our time is limited here on earth (mass amounts of carbon dioxide) the ocean investigation most likely won't happen ever. Which is why I said that. Evolution could also improve our resistance. Obviously not invincibility, but it'll help."
Showerthoughts,fc1mb5w,t1_fc18901,1577323060.0,"Well no, when you have showerthought you share it off of what you think out of the back of your head. Not really something your 100% serious about. That would be a fact."
Showerthoughts,fc1m69p,t1_fc165mg,1577322940.0,I mean you'd be history by then? So will everybody else. Earth probably will definitely be destroyed by the time we do that because of the estimated carbon dioxide toxication.
Showerthoughts,fc1m24o,t1_fc158mf,1577322839.0,"Hey all i'm saying is look at this. We've only explored 3% of the entire ocean and... Machines are this Millennia's specialty so We'd probably start from mars and eventually through millions of years maybe less we could create machines to withstand the deadliness of the planets. Especially the fact that we're actually researching planets. Not as much with water though. But hey, i'm theorizing fellow scientist."
Showerthoughts,fc1lrjf,t1_fc1465f,1577322583.0,I mean we've only explored 3% of the fucking ocean. And the earth will not be able to survive for much longer than it is now.
Showerthoughts,fc1lo62,t1_fc158m5,1577322503.0,Well I mean same with the oceans pressure. So what are you saying?
Showerthoughts,fc1lkjt,t1_fc19g16,1577322411.0,"No but look, it's like half joke half seriousness.
We could probably build a machine that could walk on it. So we'd technically be walking on it. But the oceans pressure, and its size makes it hard to explore. Hence, that's not until a *loooooooong* time. Plus we would probably evolve to lots of heat instead of pressure. Since mars loves heat and coldness."

Showerthoughts,fbzlp02,t1_fbywvd6,1577250952.0,"Well you see...

You don't really understand what i'm saying do you? I also find something *funny!* and that's the fact that we have covered every color but! We only support colors that we can see. So if there was another color, then that would make everything different. Red, for example is the best use for danger and things because its wavelength is bigger. Which is also why it's the biggest in the rainbow. 

I know all this, i'm not some premature dumbass okay. The rainbow, right... That's ROYGBIV Red orange yellow green blue Indigo and violet. That could be different for lets say... A different species with different eyes. They could see some different colors, creating a different spectrum of colors. Now the colors we see are common in other animals.

 But you see some species are way different, a flies eyes can process 240 frames per second, and  Tardigrades are immortal. Since things can be so unique, an animal could see different colors. And scientists wouldn't know no matter what, even by studying it's eyes because again...
*The Cones In our eyes don't support that*
Hence, scientists can't figure out anymore colors."
