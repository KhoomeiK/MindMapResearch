A woman got hit by a truck in front of us, flew about 20 feet, and hit the ground. She was dead the instant she hit the ground. My mother yelled at me and my sister not to look but I saw the woman's body lying there bleeding. My mother rushed out because she knew CPR but there was nothing anyone could have done for her. I never learned her name, or who she was, but every time I go by that spot I get a chill. The guy who hit her stayed around and did everything he needed to, although I don't know if he was driving fast and hit her or if she jumped in front of his truck. My parents stayed in the car for a few minutes when we got home, my mother was crying, and my sister started crying when we got inside. I had to be strong for my sister at that point, I let her cry on my shoulder for a while, even though I wanted to cry as well. That's not a sight I'm ever going to forget, seeing someone die messes with your head in ways I can't describe. I wouldn't wish it on anybody."

Ancient nords probably took a little more time crafting their weapons, although probably not too much more time. They didn't have to supply as many soldiers given that ancient nords were more skilled warriors than any other race on tamriel at the time, and weren't as numerous as the other races. It's also possible the swords you find on draugr are ceremonial blades that had more care put into their design.

On Voyager they were looking for signs of civilizations because they couldn't exactly go to a starbase to restock on supplies, but a ship not set up for exploration probably wouldn't find too much if it just went on a trip to another star system. As for why the dominion is unknown, the federation actually isn't that big. Most maps show it as being 200 lightyears wide at its widest. By deep space 9, a ship can only go maybe five lightyears a day, given that it takes 10 days to get from bajor to earth, and bajor is 52 lightyears away from earth. The distances are still so vast, and exploration ships can only go so far. The enterprise d went about as far as the pleiades, which is 400 lightyears from earth, and that probably took weeks of traveling to get there.

The politician can say the people refusing service are bigots, and the people refusing service can say they're within their right to do it and say to take it up with the politician. Or you could shift blame to anyone involved from the person who introduced the bill to their state government to the others that voted for it or the people who enforced it.
