gamedev,ffftrdu,t3_et85u9,1579891615.0,"I feel like a lot of people are very stuck in their ways on what pixel art has to be. Yes some of these animations lose the ""punch"", but that's not because of high framerate, it's just the program not knowing what's supposed to be ""punchy"" and just mindlessly interpolating all the frames smoothly, like it's supposed to. Pixel art doesn't have to be 12 fps to have punch or charm. It takes an intelligent human being making intelligent choices about which frames to exaggerate for effect.

Take Smash Bros' animations. The games run at 60 fps but are still snappy and punchy, because the animators know how to create the effect they want using scale and *timing*, which are unrelated to framerate.

I do agree that a lot of these look pretty bad though, but I blame the program being unable to distinguish intentional timing choices from smooth frames."
disneyvacation,ffdq79f,t1_ffbrw9j,1579826317.0,This whole thing is a goldmine. I don't know how you picked just one.
gamedev,ffdoy48,t1_ffchf5w,1579825529.0,"As I mentioned to another comment, there are certainly situations where I'd like to not tip the scales one way or the other. I thought You Have to Beat the Game was okay, but I would have lowered its ratings due to having a LOT of BS moments, like levels you literally had to use console commands to do, or a true ending that you could only get by deciphering an extremely obscure hint on the wall. I didn't hate it but I didn't like it much, so I couldn't really rate it."
gamedev,ffdoayd,t1_ffd8aus,1579825128.0,"I think Steam just cuts out the inevitability of letting most people rate something 5 for ""like"" and 1-2 for ""hate"" by just giving them two options, since that's how 70%+ of users treat a 1-5 star rating system anyways.

One also has to consider the purpose of the ratings for a particular storefront. A game has 3.7 stars; what is that supposed to mean? What is that a scale of? Replacing it with a scale of whether players recommend playing it or not is much more helpful in this case.

I will concede that the ""YES OR NO"" ratings fail in some cases; I was trying to give a proper rating to a game that was well made and mechanically sound, but had frustrating level design, and couldn't decide if I should recommend it or not. I can understand the need for a ""meh"" rating, though I don't know if it would do anybody any good ultimately."
gamedev,ffdn5gq,t1_ffd6qm4,1579824431.0,"Five stars is the highest one is capable of rating something. If that doesn't mean perfect then it's impossible to rate something as such, which, regardless of the fact that it's impossible for a game to be ""perfect"", should be possible with a rating system."

gamedev,ffcexmm,t1_ffcdfb5,1579797997.0,"Regular people don't have some scale they're using to rate things. It's like that XKCD comic saying:

* 5 stars: only one rating
* 4.5 stars: excellent
* 4 stars: passable
* <4 stars: terrible

When people like something they give it 5 stars, which objectively *should* mean it's the best game they've ever played and there's nothing wrong in any way. When it makes them mad, they give it 1-2 stars, which *should* mean that it's a broken pile of trash that barely works, or is just an awful game. People tend to suck at reviewing things by anything other than absolute love or hate (look at the Google Play Store reviews to see evidence of that).

The Recommended/Not Recommended system is better because it gives people a simple way to say whether they would purchase it now, having already played it. It doesn't ask players to review the graphics or technical achievement, or deep gameplay analysis; it just asks if you think it's worth the money or time. Plus it forces you to verbally expand upon your opinion so others can judge *why* you didn't like it, and decide if those things would inhibit them as well.

EDIT: I'm also pretty sure Steam uses the Helpful/Not Helpful ratings to determine the ""weight"" each vote has as well, so if someone just says ""sucks"" and everyone marks it as unhelpful, it won't tip the scale very much."

Everyone pointing at Notch saying ""Look, you can make a huge success right off the bat!"" is just as misled as people who mention that such-and-such billionaire didn't go to college as justification to drop out of school. It's called dumb luck, and it shouldn't be relied on for success.

The SCPs are cool but I think Control gives A.I. more solid context and consistency about the kinds of things they typically do. Plus Altered Items are just that: items.

howdidtheycodeit,fdecbx4,t3_e2fe6k,1578335918.0,"I've created shaders that do something like this in Unity.

gamedev,fdeb3vk,t1_fde62l5,1578335151.0,"No, game development is not a real job. Game development in and of itself doesn't pay out until the product is out the door, and maybe not even then. Unless you are making enough to support yourself and anyone else that depends on you, it is a hobby, not a job.

If you are running a game development company or holding a job at one that regularly pulls in enough to keep yourself afloat, then and only then is game development a job.

If you've quit your day job to do game dev full time without assurance that you will remain successful and financially stable for the foreseeable future, you're a terrible planner and painfully misguided. ""Don't quit your day job"" is a phrase for a reason, especially in this field. It is notoriously one of the most complicated and difficult fields to work in, let alone succeed.

Frankly you're also being horribly disrespectful to everyone you come into contact with, and if I may say so, seem to be projecting quite a bit onto others. You've also failed to bring up a single source on your apocalyptic predictions for an entire industry and refuse to even consider any opposing viewpoints with anything other than ""No, I'm right"".

Unity3D,fdcwyx4,t1_fd9xrnl,1578286754.0,"I'm noticing the angriest people here are the ones screaming about Unity being free and calling everyone whiners and other extremely immature things. People complain about the dark theme because out of all the things one could lock off, that seems like a fairly petty and random one, considering the other features are all just for professionals (analytics, no splash screen). The ""they have the right to do yada yada because they worked hard"" argument is so fallacious and tired.

Unity's business model is to let people make games for free and then get a flat rate from subscriptions when/if they make it big. They don't want to get pocket change from amateurs, they want a big cut from people who are already doing great for themselves and won't mind. It seems, therefore, a bit silly to hide a feature that is supposed to allow people to work longer without undue eyestrain.

Saying people aren't allowed to complain if they aren't paying is a completely invalid argument when that is quite literally Unity's plan in the first place. Personal users are the first rung on the way to paying customers."

controlgame,fdiqoj1,t1_fdhjpp4,1578448885.0,"The stories are a part to be sure, but personally I think Control is much more interesting, partially due to it having more canon lore and such that SCP just inherently can't maintain. The SCPs are cool but I think Control gives A.I. more solid context and consistency about the kinds of things they typically do. Plus Altered Items are just that: items. Usually in Control, if there's some creature involved, it's dangerous and invasive.

Just my two cents. I personally never got into SCP even though I liked the idea, but Control just has something elusive and intriguing about it."

howdidtheycodeit,fdecbx4,t3_e2fe6k,1578335918.0,"I've created shaders that do something like this in Unity. What it's probably doing is simply taking the lighting direction and multiplying the color of each normal by some shadow color (dark blue or just black), and then blending between the two by the difference in direction. I.E, the more similar the face's direction to the light's direction, the darker is gets and vice versa."
gamedev,fdeb3vk,t1_fde62l5,1578335151.0,"No, game development is not a real job. Game development in and of itself doesn't pay out until the product is out the door, and maybe not even then. Unless you are making enough to support yourself and anyone else that depends on you, it is a hobby, not a job.

If you are running a game development company or holding a job at one that regularly pulls in enough to keep yourself afloat, then and only then is game development a job.

If you've quit your day job to do game dev full time without assurance that you will remain successful and financially stable for the foreseeable future, you're a terrible planner and painfully misguided. ""Don't quit your day job"" is a phrase for a reason, especially in this field. It is notoriously one of the most complicated and difficult fields to work in, let alone succeed.

Frankly you're also being horribly disrespectful to everyone you come into contact with, and if I may say so, seem to be projecting quite a bit onto others. You've also failed to bring up a single source on your apocalyptic predictions for an entire industry and refuse to even consider any opposing viewpoints with anything other than ""No, I'm right"". Unless you can do either of those, you're wasting everyone's precious time."
Unity3D,fdcwyx4,t1_fd9xrnl,1578286754.0,"I'm noticing the angriest people here are the ones screaming about Unity being free and calling everyone whiners and other extremely immature things. People complain about the dark theme because out of all the things one could lock off, that seems like a fairly petty and random one, considering the other features are all just for professionals (analytics, no splash screen). The ""they have the right to do yada yada because they worked hard"" argument is so fallacious and tired.

Unity's business model is to let people make games for free and then get a flat rate from subscriptions when/if they make it big. They don't want to get pocket change from amateurs, they want a big cut from people who are already doing great for themselves and won't mind. It seems, therefore, a bit silly to hide a feature that is supposed to allow people to work longer without undue eyestrain.

Saying people aren't allowed to complain if they aren't paying is a completely invalid argument when that is quite literally Unity's plan in the first place. Personal users are the first rung on the way to paying customers."

Easily my best weapon. I don't know why a lot of people around here think it's bad. Even with a -75% debuff in one mission, it still outdid every other gun in damage.

EDIT: I meant Spin, not Shatter. Don't know how that happened."
