Sick, the most vulnerable humans as they scrounge on the street like animals because we are selfish...is bad for our health.

Maybe 40 years after Reagan created this problem we’ll finally fix homelessness.

Oh wait... no. 

That wasn’t the solution you had in mind, was it."

Many Animals in captivity  (spoiler: we’re animals!) tend to follow an instinct that tells them to lie around/lay on fat when they don’t have to be actively engaged in feeding-related movement.

Some have “nervous energy” and tend to develop neurotic pacing, aggression, and physical outbursts of violence as an alternative outlet to a smaller “range.”

Try some of the BBC/David Attenborough documentaries. They really pull these things together evolutionarily."
