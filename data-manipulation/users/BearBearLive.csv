(That Botox has really softened her face, I used to be scared she was going to explode on Mykul any moment. Now...not as much piano fingers nail biting)."

femalehairadvice,fe3xbpw,t3_enny6l,1578853708.0,"Get a 100% mulberry silk pillowcase to sleep on. This will lessen the bed head look. 

A flat iron will help getting a more polished look in the morning. After ironing your hair, let the hair cool down before moving it too much, so it will hold its shape. 

A flat iron is great at creating curls too. You can find techniques on YouTube. 

Let your hair grow past your shoulders, if you want it to lay better.

If you need more volume on top, then condition lightly on the top and work it in at the ends."

I’ve found AirPods and the Apple wired earbuds so many times in the dryer (meaning they must’ve gone through the washer too) and they still work fine. Even an old iPod that had water in the screen, dried out and still works. Actually when the water was in the screen, everything looked 3D and was actually kind of amazing looking."
