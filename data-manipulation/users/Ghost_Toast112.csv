Advice,ffdmzup,t1_ffctr6s,1579824336.0,That sounds nice I’ve actually seen some suggestions on other posts I have read in the past about mail carrying being nice enough where you can do your own work alone. Thanks for the tip. Helped!
Advice,ffce9g5,t1_ffcd6pw,1579797583.0,"Yeah I might just not be someone who works well on multitasking and knowing how to split my attention like in food. 
The jobs I really wanted to work were stocking, car pushing, or this small tie store

I wanted a job where I can kinda just do my own thing and not have coworkers or a manager breathing done my neck.

Might look into those jobs again and just put a application in."
Advice,ffce186,t1_ffcchfe,1579797442.0,Yeah. If I got any training lmao. But I see what you mean. I’ll give it a shot
Advice,ffcdzpt,t1_ffcbmto,1579797418.0,See but like that sounds nice. I know jobs are not glamorous that’s not what I’m looking for. In all honesty I just want. A job where I can kinda shut my brain off and do a task cause school is where I want to dedicate my energy more so rather thank trying to memorize a ton of different fast food items and procedures.
Advice,ffcdthx,t1_ffcbhe9,1579797308.0,Yeah but I’d feel like crap for screwing over the manager after they just got done training me. Yeah the job is uncomfortable and new but I firmly believe I’d do better in a job with less multi tasking and where I can do my work in peace like stocking or janitors work. Not sure tho so I’ll stick out this next weekend of work
Advice,ffcdnj6,t1_ffcbdqc,1579797203.0,"The customer and managers are fine to a certain extent cause like you said I look at it as just a job. But I don’t know I kinda want to stay cause I don’t want my job hopping to be a pattern but honestly the few times I enjoyed work were when I was doing like hard labor on my one like garbage, washing a dumpsters, and doing dishes so I thought maybe that’s my type work."
Advice,ffcdfoc,t1_ffcd6pw,1579797065.0,Yeah see I’d take droning tasks over retail jobs that have rushes. I just suck at multitasking and more power to anyone who can dod those jobs but my best work is done when I can just do it on my own
Advice,ffcaq7j,t1_ffcajqm,1579795370.0,I’ve already considered that your late to the party my friend
introvert,ffabwkw,t1_ffab1nx,1579731902.0,I like both of your ideas. And yeah I have been seeing a lot of stock room and linear or so I’ll look into it. How would the teaching English online work though?
relationships,ff984ei,t3_es9k8r,1579707044.0,"This same exact situation happened to r and I was in the boyfriends shoes. It was the most immense pain I had ever felt in my life. And some days I still think about it but it’s only been two months compared to two years. But I can promise you. I wouldn’t have it any other way when I think about it. We got to the point to where I could tell we couldn’t solve any problems anymore and while I still loved her and believe she loved me deeply I always felt a looming sense of something being wrong. I knew it was going to end and it dragged out as long as it could but it honestly should have ended sooner. 

Although it hurts and I still hold a special place for her. I’m glad I no longer have to worry about “being enough” like your boyfriend feels. I can focus on myself and become stronger because I always knew I depended too much on the relationship for self esteem.

It’s the right thing to do just for the sake that both of you deserve a equal kind of love."
TrueOffMyChest,ff834le,t1_ff81yf5,1579664726.0,I can’t tell you how long it’s been since I heard a genuine statement like that to me. Thank you so much.
Advice,ff0dlvk,t1_feyq2vj,1579467917.0,"Yeah but I don’t look down on anyone who works these jobs and I do want a job. I just do not like jobs dealing with sales I guess. Like someone mentions earlier I like jobs where I kinda have a set routine or to do list. I don’t need money right now but my parents want me to learn the value of work which I understand. But I also would like to focus on school more rather than also hate a job. 

I can’t tell if it’s the jobs or me. Personally every job I did want and seemed relaxed and perfect for me always never called back so I never knew so I often took up the easier ones that hired more.

Edit: I want a job too for the income and saving but I do feel like there are jobs I can be way happier in."
jobs,fex51av,t1_fewxsdw,1579424503.0,Yeah honestly I love doing hard labor like janitorial work or construction (does run in my family). And while it is not my main career path I would love to have a job inc plebe that was more hard labor and longer tasks than running around trying to memorize Ice cream combinations
Advice,fewt8tt,t1_fewssxc,1579419147.0,Honestly I’m just positive fast food is not for me and I think most can say the same. It is common to be more of a job that hires more for people in a pinch for a job. But since I still have time I am going to keep on the hunt for other jobs and be more selective that way this doesn’t happen again. Thanks for the tip though! I definitely look into it
Advice,fewjo4p,t3_eqs0fp,1579412001.0,"I know that’s I haven’t quit yet. But they instilled they idea that I won’t find anything better. Like every job open to me right now is all run by negative people, condescending managers, and that it is all there is to find. The old job I worked for a day at actually had some pretty positive people and I enjoyed some of it but I was so overwhelmed with all the procedures. Maybe I jsut have the grass is greener syndrome or maybe I really am seeking myself short. I guess I’ll never know. I’ll keep looking."
Advice,fewitr3,t1_fewiaq7,1579411410.0,Right now I only need  gas for my car and savings in general but that’s all. I could make enough through other smaller things I found I could do in my free time but mostly I barely spend any money. My college is all paid for by my grades which I feel are slipping from this job but I don’t know. I feel guilt because everyone keeps telling me I’m just weak and i coward out of things but I honestly just don’t feel like it’s worth it when I could focus harder on school and even take a little more time to find a slower paced and less anxious job
Advice,fewhcwd,t1_fewgsnl,1579410598.0,"See and that is innately wrong so my answer is. I only need money right now for gas. That’s not to say I won’t get another job it’s just I am tired of jumping on jobs to please those around me because in my parents case “every had a job by this age”. I understand that and I do want a job but every job I want I get dropped from so all my other “filler” applications I put in to please my parents always get accepted and then I am hired because they are on me about it. I don’t think I hate work, but I am a little select compared to the jobs I would actually do to the ones I apply too."
Advice,fewg4te,t1_fewfwqn,1579410023.0,Could you rephrase that? Sorry
jobs,fepp35c,t1_fepo6he,1579326624.0,Sadly probably going to stick it out because I don’t wanna let my friend and parents down. Hopefully it gets better it’s just really sucky right now
BreakUps,fe6mfz5,t1_fe6mcq3,1578895902.0,"I know it’s stupid to ask but you have felt this way right. Highschool sweetheart thing, “felt like it was forever”, “the love was so pure and innocent” type of thing. I hate how this stuff happens all the time but I still feel so hurt and lost and alone. did you make it through?"
BreakUps,fduoh1f,t3_en5drx,1578736285.0,"Yes, by building yourself stronger and happier without them. The best revenge more than physically or emotionally getting back at them is showing how much happier and healthier you are because they left. Breakups are a huge opportunity to change everything and reflect on who you are and your values. Build up your confidence, chase the passions and the moment they see how much they missed out, it gets to them but you will be strong and happy you will know there is better love out there. Hoped this helped :)

Edit: in my experience, it only ends well because either they relapse they mistake but now your happy and found priority in life without them or you both love happy lives separate and find better partners or happiness within yourself. As I say. It goes like this, love, hate, then uncaring. Uncaring is the final form because unlike love or hate, they take energy you’d lend time loving someone or spend time hating them and wanting to hate. Uncaring in what they do and who they are shows that they no longer have any effect or value in your life."
TrueOffMyChest,fdtbdsm,t1_fdt8ikr,1578714376.0,"It’s not going to happen in a day. But something small you enjoy, or when you notice your happy doing something then keep at it. Just try to be active. I know especially when you have a degree almost done it’s not as easy. But there are always opportunities out there."
TrueOffMyChest,fdt5zb5,t3_en1swg,1578712359.0,"The reality is you don’t want to move on...well not actively atleast. You just expect to one day have your feelings go “poof” which is not a reality. I suspect it was a “spark like no other” feeling. Study when you can feel that again but your limiting yourself. First you need to forgive yourself. You made mistakes she made mistakes. Does it really matter anymore? No because you can’t change it. All you can do is learn from it and forgive yourself because at the end of the day if you admit you regret it want to change form it you can’t beat yourself cup over it because that only going to hold you back from moving forward and loving yourself. She was a great Time in your lofe and I’m sure your hooked on the rush or positive chemicals she gives you from  all those good memories and without those rush of chemicals you need them like an addiction. Love is an addiction. But the only way to combat using it like one is to be happy first as you are and find a bigger purpose in life. What are your hobbies, interests, things you want to achieve in this world. Follow those and soon you will feel better in yourself and not reliant on the feelings of a relationship . This is your life and your not living it because of another person? Read articles about sec love and feeling happy single. It should put more ideas into your head Better than I can put into this post. Hoped this helped. :)"
offmychest,fcoq8iq,t1_fcoph9d,1577838666.0,It’s never too late cal her up. Tell her hey I changed my mind. I have social anxiety and even going out some days on my own is fight but when I do. I always feel better whether it was good or bad. I knew I was pushing and changing with each step. Just ask and see if she is willing. You never know until you try.
TrueOffMyChest,fcooe5q,t3_eiavkk,1577837319.0,You do deserve love and honestly it could because you have a innate sense of lack of love in yourself or a fear of abandonment. I have a philosophy there is no such thing as a evil or bad person in this world only one of fear and trauma which leads to negative reactions to regain a sense of control or order. Maybe you should go to therapy because I can see you want to be a better person a therapy can only reinforce you are not a bad person and that you can be even stronger against these feelings than you think. I wish and your boyfriend wellness and a happy new year
offmychest,fconq3n,t3_eiazb9,1577836826.0,"Go to the party. Trust me. Make some friends, heck even just sit with your friend or with the pet if they have a dog. It will be worth it."
offmychest,fcjczuh,t3_ehhijz,1577683411.0,"Hey dude. I am in your exact same boat. I didn’t read the entire thing but from what I am getting you feel kinda like a crappy dude, who has anxiety, and everything feels so dull in life. Honestly I would recommend going to a therapist or psychiatrist cause not many know, a form of depression can make you irritable and actually hate a lot of things while also drying the color out of life. For my anxiety I helped it by just trying to love myself. You’re in this planet for a reason man don’t sell yourself short. Don’t worry about anything it your mental and physical well being because that’s where the foundation is. I hoped this helped."
Advice,fchma9t,t1_fchjfcv,1577651775.0,"I know I am but like. I don’t understand why I know these things but yet I still wake up in the morning and miss her

Edit: helped"
relationships,fcdhj34,t1_fcdg6n7,1577610076.0,Well even so. It’s too early to know. Give it more time. And if she just seems passive and friendly then she is most likely just trying to bury the hatchet and seal her guilt and distance for the way things ended.
Advice,fcdh62y,t3_eh3n96,1577609983.0,Yeah man trust me gf is in the military and she dropped me flat in 4 months and we had been dating for two years and she found another man in a month we broke up. I may have biased cause I feel like most of you guys are manipulative and when a women is lonley you guys slip in like a snake but that’s what you do best. You’ll probably find someone
relationships,fcdfy6y,t3_eh3nof,1577609669.0,She’s most likely trying to be nice. Don’t overthink it. Focus on yourself man don’t worry about a relationship
offmychest,fcddull,t3_eh3ojc,1577609141.0,Same boat here kinda. Met junior year and were together for two years but off and on first year because we were both so insecure. She went to the military I went to college she broke it off because I was having a tough time adjusting and not being as supportive but I miss the heck out of her. Oh and she was my first love. In all honesty I just think of it as a addiction. I only want them back to feel good but I can’t see us going long term. So I should learn to be happy with myself in depend on her so much and once I am truly happy single will the purest love be found. Hoped this helped. There are plenty people out there and loving yourself first should always be a priority.
rant,fccdpdb,t3_eh2287,1577597222.0,I felt that. I always say I wanna do stuff and it just kinda fades into the background and I sit inside all the time. Like legit I need to find a good best friend or something
BreakUps,fcatlt6,t1_fc9o550,1577576360.0,Me and my ex broke up after 2 years together and she went to the military. To say the least I let myself go in my motivation and insecurities only made me hold her back too but she was also just as insecure too but when she joined she got her purpose and eventually she left me. I still care about and honestly I don’t want to go back until I feel happy but is there even a point. She will live miles away and wants to do 10 years. I support her now and still want time to heal and grow but should I just move on. This is my first relationship. It’s only been a month and sorry to ask this.
mentalhealth,fc7ql6c,t3_egk7aw,1577516116.0,The first step is obviously knowing it’s wrong in some way or opting for change so I commend you for that. But have you thought deeper than this. Perhaps you feel somewhere in your life you are unhappy or past trauma has made you feel adversely or short with the types of people you mention and their reactions. Often things like this stems from a lack of something within themselves o they do not offer it to others. Do you lack empathy or love for yourself?
Advice,fc7fp3j,t1_fc6ywxt,1577506035.0,Thank you! Honestly thanks to my college being 20 minutes away I drive a lot more now. My mind set was mostly this feeling sucks and feels heavy so I don’t want to leave but I realized I just gotta go and do something or find something fun even if this feeling is trash.
Advice,fc6e8pf,t1_fc69scf,1577478495.0,Damn. This too well said. The whole relationship I beat myself up because I knew I was getting better as a person but because it still never met her expectation I devalued myself a ton. I am getting better everyday. I did hurt her and maybe apologizing isn’t right in a sense right now but I still feel like as a human I want to just acknowledge my wrongs but I also still know my self worth and good parts. This helped. Thank you. Do you believe it may be to early to face her in a Sense and give her time to move on too.
Advice,fc60jj5,t1_fc52bas,1577469593.0,helped
Advice,fc5ztan,t1_fc59jo0,1577469206.0,But I’m not man. I’m a person. Like you. Sounds like you got more of an issues getting hurt my an anonymous post than I was by your response
Advice,fc50602,t1_fc4s7ga,1577436322.0,Yeah honestly like I associated go out with her so all I do is obsessively think about because I’m trapped in a house with little friends. I know I need a ton more independence and just overall learning to be ok with being alone and confidence which is why things got so unhealthy between us because we both came together to essentially validate each other. I’m so freakin young and it’s even dumb I’m having my first breakup at 18. I just need to honestly grow up. I was sheltered a lot and did not help one bit. Some responsibility and purpose I think is what I need right now so I am job hunting.
offmychest,fbzzqdg,t1_fbzva1w,1577270715.0,Ohhhhh I felt this. I struggle slot from social anxiety and a bad father. So it made me both very vulnerable and nervous but also defensive and protecting. I wanted to move forward in our relationship cause our first year was bad but she held on so much to who I was. I wasn’t perfect but I had reduced so much of my outburst of defensiveness and even become the one who addressed problems and openly shared feelings. She became more and more reserved until another man came along and “saved” her (which is kinda why we started dating cause I could tell she needed guidance) and told her. Was only bad. She held on so tight to what I was not rather than what I was trying to do’s and was doing. I feel super devalued but a book I am reading really helped me in seeing that options are very minuscule in the grand scheme of life and people come and go for reasons and as the please. Each one of us deserves happiness and the ability to forgive and love ourselves.
