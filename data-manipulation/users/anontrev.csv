xbox,ffokwx0,t3_eue3wb,1580078736.0,"I went all the way to Egypt (they are infamous for taking luggage and electronics) with mine.
Hell, nobody even looked at it or asked. I’m sure you’ll be 100% ok bring it."

British/Russians/Americans/French are the most common tourists, and you’d be surprised how many Egyptians speak English (and even French).

Depending where you’d like to go in the city, there are warnings about going out a night (especially if you’re a woman and I’m not just saying that, men can be very...forward). Pickpockets are very common, people will harass you to come in their shops but if you do make sure you haggle, and don’t be afraid to walk away. Tourist zones are money grabs (with up to 25% tourists taxes). 
Overall it’s safe, but just be mindful of your surroundings and don’t go into alleyways. The people are extremely friendly, and I’ve never had any issues. Definitely something to experience in a lifetime. 

If you’re looking to do more partying, I’d suggest going to Sharm (they party every day). And I would do your best to go to Luxor (much much more interesting then Cairo)"

As soon as liquid hits the motherboard it causes damage and is irreversible...so though it may be working now, eventually something MAY happen.
I say may, because you may just be extremely lucky and nothing “vital” has water damage."
xbox,ffhmhms,t3_etod2m,1579942372.0,Yes...I believe that’s acceptable.
JustBootThings,ffhmdp9,t1_ffhb13n,1579942208.0,I dunno. I’m assuming he just wants people to thank him for his service.
JustBootThings,ffhm5sr,t1_ffgykpg,1579941880.0,Lol. Fuck that got me.
entertainment,ffhir88,t1_ffg907u,1579937102.0,"Eh. Let’s break this down. 
1. You DO have to be nominated, yes. But anyone can nominate you, well over 200 people are each year (apparently)
2. There is a selection committee, that chooses people. New rules state they have to related to “entrainment in one of the five categories”
3. Once you are chosen for the walk of fame, the nominee HAS to pay a fee ($50,000 or more), then they have to set up the “reveal” yourself. 
4. They must attend the “reveal” or they don’t get it.
Julia Roberts is someone who said no thanks to all that. 
Basically, yes, a way of making money for this “committee” considering they put up 20 people a year."
