I always try to enter these conversations honestly. The Indian Wars were a thing, Slavery was a thing, the era of segregation and Jim Crow was a thing.

worldnews,ffy4h65,t1_ffxuadp,1580338373.0,"Low oil prices are probably hurting them more than anything. Russia is just a giant petro state. They export around 5 million barrels of oil a day. Fossil exports make up 50% of their total exports, 16% of their GDP and 50% of government revenue. Don't get me wrong, sanctions are definitely hurting them. They got used to getting $100 a barrel for oil, current prices are killing them (around $60 a barrel today)."
elderscrollsonline,ffx8nr0,t1_ffx744t,1580320053.0,""" Stick with light armor and staff (obv)"" Good advice, though you can (and should) use a heavy chest piece and medium legs.

With a set of Pelinials you can make a pretty decent hybrid. You'd want medium armor for that though. The idea being to maximize you weapon dmg in order to increase your spell damage (Pelinial set bonus makes your spell power/weapon power the same as the highest of the two).

You can get a damage shield from the Brawl morph for Cleave. It's not huge but you can stack that with the sorc dmg bubble. 

If you go with heavy armor your dps will suffer, but as long as you're PVE'ing it's not a big deal. Do what you want and have fun!

I would think someone who brings people, energy, and money to the Democratic party would be welcome. It would seem Biden has the most to gain from beating up on Sanders, but he 's isn't going after him. So why is everyone else going after him then? And why now? I'll be honest I haven't been paying awhile lot of attention to the Democratic debates/primary stuff, it just seems weird that the last week has turned into ""Get Sanders"".

worldbuilding,fe54a93,t3_ent4xy,1578865488.0,"I wouldn't say historians occasionally get history wrong, I would say that they often get it wrong. Generally this isn't due a defect in material but in a defect in the historian. Edward Gibbon, probably the first 'modern' historian, central thesis that religion (Christianity) was a major contributor to the fall of the Roman empire immediately springs to mind. This idea has been generally disproven and isn't supported by any historian today. Gibbons, like a great many historians, allowed his own prejudices to taint an otherwise brilliant analysis of Roman history. Howard Zinn is similarly guilty in trying to inject Marxist class struggle as the central theme of American history. Again it's a historian seeing something he wants to see, or perhaps magnifying the proportions to fit his worldview.

And they aren't alone. A great many less competent historians of the 19th century commonly injected their views of race and ethnicity into histories for nationalist purposes. Look at Nazi Germany for examples of this. In the medieval and ancient past histories were used as propaganda for monarchs to support their claims of legitimacy or to push claims on territories. Shakespeare's history plays were, for the most part, Tudor propaganda. Richard III has to be evil, because Henry VII replaced him (the grandfather of Elizabeth I). You can't be legitimate if you replace a good, competent king. This sort of thing was hardly isolated to Europeans, as China, Japan and pretty much every monarchy/empire in history as engaged in similar image management. 

I think for story purposes the most common historical inaccuracy involves a history denouncing someone as a villain only to discover that they were actually fairly decent (historical figures are seldom 'good guys' lol) or the opposite, the pristine hero of the nation was actually a dirty scoundrel. The biggest history twist would probably be finding out that the historical representation of a major player was 100% spot on, that would be a real shock :D"
