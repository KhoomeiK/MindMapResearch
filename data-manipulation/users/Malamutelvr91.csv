CPTSD,fegbiw4,t3_ep0fyn,1579086350.0,"Hugs! Can you possibly write down things you remember and the feelings (then & now) associated with them? My therapist has me do that; write down anything that comes to mind and the emotions. When I'm done, I'm supposed to put it away, breathe and find a way to center myself back into the present. Then I bring it with me to my session & when we're done with those memories, I burn them. (You don't have to burn them, I do it as closure.)

Edit: It sounds like your ""more tolerable parent"" is in denial."

raisedbynarcissists,feco9d7,t3_eogm4u,1578978952.0,"I have to say, I highly reccomend that you put an end to him using your identity. That's identity fraud and could cause you huge trouble unless you turn the tables. He's an adult and committed the crime, he should pay. Same thing applies if he does take the car before you sell - call the cops. Good for you for getting rid of the car! I don't blame you for one second and try not to feel guilty. I know it's hard, but remind yourself that this will be one less thing for him to use as a weapon and one step closer to NC."

I'm terrified of being like him in any way. I have daily battles where I fight his voice telling me I'm just fat, stupid and lazy P.O.S. that won't amount to anything. There are times that I swear I hear him storming down the hall to scream and beat me for some stupid minuscule thing (that I may not even had been involved in).

Please do yourself a favor and RUN the next time (if there is one) a girl mentions her ex - especially if it's right before sex. Be honest about not wanting to just jump into sex if you don't want to. If she can't respect that, then there's the door. I promise you'll find someone."
