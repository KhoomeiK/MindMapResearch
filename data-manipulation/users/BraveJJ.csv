AmItheAsshole,ffdok93,t1_ffd2l9x,1579825286.0,">no one under 60 carries a check around with them

I'm a millennial and carry a check book. And even if I didn't, and needed to grab a check from home (which is essentially what OP did by returning another day with change) at least then I don't have to go to the bank to GET change."

When I'm balancing the budget, I sometimes ask my partner about charges that I don't recognize. Just trying to make sure we don't miss identity theft."

Pets,ff7mr1p,t1_ff7kx80,1579653262.0,"Yup. I've been using them forever (hello dental bills). My vet has a $200 and 18 months deferred interest option so I choose that each time. They also offer an interest plan for those not wanting deferred interest. When my boy needed TPLO surgery, I was given the option of 6 months deferred interest @ 24% or 24 months fixed payment @ 15%. I knew I wouldn't pay off the $6K surgery in 6 months so I opted for the 2 year plan whose interest rate was on par with major credit cards at the time."

My partner puts in 6% with a company match of 75% for a total contribution of 10.5%. We won't increase our retirement savings until his student loans are paid off (end of this year, finally!) and we've gotten rid of our debt besides our mortgage. Both of our 401ks are on target funds that automatically reallocate based on the target date (going more conservative as we get older)."

TrollXChromosomes,fenpe82,t1_fenm7tm,1579288871.0,"How do you want to address it? Cause there are avenues to address safe practices within the kink community already. If a guy is not respecting a no, how is that porn's fault? Where did his socialization fail?"
TrollXChromosomes,fenjvts,t1_fencjeo,1579286265.0,"I consume some horrifically violent porn but I ensure my partners are on board with SAFE practices. My partner and I attended safety classes put on by our local BDSM club prior to attempting any of the stuff we viewed online. 

There are clear signs when someone is in need of care during a scene and the fact that the men who are topping these women don't care to learn or know or check in on their partners is more a sign of internalized misogynistic thinking than of the type of porn consumed. 

The misogynistic thinking could include thoughts that he knows better than her, that she's putting up a ""token"" resistance. Or maybe he just doesn't care about anything than feeling powerful even if it's at the discomfort or untimely death of someone else. 

It took me almost 5 years to blow a man after the first guy I blew held me down on his dick after I couldn't hold my breath any longer. I lost all trust in blowing men that day. And it took a huge amount of time for my long term partner to build up my trust again to where I could blow him. Now I will gladly let him face fuck me or try deep throat because he has a record of prioritizing my safety and comfort over his own desires (as it should be if you're topping anyone)."

Sometime during the night, I ""lost"" my blanket, and proceeded to steal ALL his blankets then i proceeded to ""lose"" those off the other side of the bed. Woke up at 1am freezing my ass off all ready to fight someone over stealing my blankets and he's just like ""fight yourself, you're the blanket stealer. Now let's get all the blankets back up cause I'm tired and cold."" So I get the struggle."
GriefSupport,fek7qm2,t1_fej5sz5,1579194364.0,"I'm 100% with you on this one. People can be SO judgmental over someone else's grief. My best friend lost her wife and more than a handful of people actively shamed her for how long she grieved. Which is the opposite of this but the kernel remains true. How someone grieves will be different than how you grieve. We don't get to make demands on how someone lives their life when a loved ones dies.  I've told my husband that if I die before him, I want him to get out there and find someone who makes him happy b/c all I want is for him to be loved and supported and happy. He won't die with me. He has to pick up the pieces I leave behind and move on. And I can only hope he moves on with a great woman who will love him as I love him. And if that woman doesn't want to meet my family, that makes sense cause why should she? ""Oh hey, this is my former in-laws.. yea... from my first wife."" How awkward."
