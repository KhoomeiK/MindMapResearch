While there, I analized what it would be to live there, to commute to work, traffic Jam, taxes, health care, etc. And it only reinforces how badly I want out.

At my home country, I work +40h a week in a senior position, hold a Master's and barely survive with a Fucking low salary. I have seen how, in other countries, cost of living is cheaper and similar roles are paid higher than here...

The only thing I would miss is our health system because with all its problems, it is quite good overall.

I sometimes work as a freelance photographer. Right now, I am trying to conquer my fears over oíl painting. I enjoy sarcasm and am radically awkward when it comes to social interactions (my students say that's what makes my classes unique... Don't know how to take that Yet)

In mi case, kinda risky to go there Alone, pay for rent, and look for jobs since I got tons of responsibilities here. It is quite interesting that this process works better than applying online though. I guess the face to face thing is a big plus.

I will continue applying. I live in Costa Rica, but I think the paperwork and Applications must be in catalán so I guess the translation is a must.

As a plan B, even though I have experience teaching in Higher Education apart from my experience as an Instructional Designer, I started learning Front End. Maybe, I will get more chances in a couple of years when I am used to Programming and could even swap between Programming and documentation roles.

With Colosseum, buy the ticket that grants you access to the undergrounds and upper floors. You have to be 15 min before the assigned time and you will access it with a group and a guide. No lines.

With the Vatican Museums, I am not sure.

I visited it 2 times and both times through the Omnia Card so didn't actually had to stay in line.

If you go for the Vatican Museums, you should include St. Peter Basílica and Sixtine Chappel. Great sight If you climb to the top of the Basílica.
