[Grayanotoxin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayanotoxin)

>Physical symptoms from grayanotoxin poisoning appear after a dose-dependent latent period of several minutes to approximately three hours. The most common clinical symptoms include various cardiovascular effects, [nausea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea) and vomiting, and a change in consciousness. The cardiovascular effects may include [hypotension](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension) (low blood pressure) and various cardiac rhythm disorders such as [sinus bradycardia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinus_bradycardia) (slow regular heart rhythm), [bradyarrhythmia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradyarrhythmia) (slow irregular heart rhythm) and partial or complete [atrioventricular block](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrioventricular_block).[[](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayanotoxin#cite_note-:1-3)

>[Nectar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectar) containing grayanotoxin can kill honeybees, though some seem to have resistance to it and can produce honey from the nectar (see below). According to a team of researchers from the UK and Ireland, worker [bumblebees](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee) are not harmed and may be preferable as pollinators because they transfer more pollen.

And yet, more land is deforested for beef than any other single thing. 60% of our arable land is devoted to beef production. This is very inefficient. Soy and palm are other drivers of deforestation. A lot of the land which is currently used to grow cattle could, in stead, be used to grow insects, or and that would increase efficiency and use waste products as inputs while delivering high quality protein.

Simply? I wanted to. Because I liked feeling the ground with my feet. It also made my calves and soleus muscles way way stronger and improved my running (side benefit.)
