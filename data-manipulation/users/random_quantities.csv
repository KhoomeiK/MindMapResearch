depression,fds5n8o,t3_emnl5m,1578694901.0,"I see all these comments in agreement, and a few that feel disrespected and as if all of this is wrong. Ive had 2 very close friends go through cancer treatments, one of which had beaten cancer but now has to fly across states to get treatments on a new currently unknown lung disease. My grandmother died of cancer years ago and she was everything to me and my family. 

Even through all of this, I know I don't want to deal with cancer, but I'm jealous of my friend because though he suffers with depression now as i do, he has a chance to make it out. He could die from one disease or another.  I have cried until i couldn't anymore and passed out on the floor trying to make myself go against instincts and put the rope around my neck. I got drunk and devoured as many pills as i could find... suicide is just so hard and its not the cancer most of us want, its the possibility of escape"
depression,fdloca4,t3_elqwy9,1578528611.0,"I think I'm just tired.. not tired in a ""not getting enough sleep"" kinda way, though i could use more of it. Im tired of work, im tired of bills, im tired of trying to change only to have my past self thrown in my face, im tired of the lies, im tired of the rude people i meet daily, im tired of forcing myself to get up in the morning, im tired of acting like i care about people that i dont, im tired of trying to be social. I just want to die. I want to stay for the few that do matter to me, but those who do matter to me seem like theyve forgotten my name and my face. I feel like i just exist for my job. I live to do my part at my work, and i come home and live as a shell. I do nothing but play games that im tired of and watch tv. I dont even remember what i watch most times. I watch things with emotions so that i can feel something and i play games so i can accomplish something. 

Even if i did change, what would i do different? Would i meet somebody? Would they tell me its all okay? Its already okay. Theres nothing wrong. I dont need pity, i need to feel. I need excitement. But whats left to be excited about? Ive lost my wonder. I just want to rot."
depression,fdd1wjr,t3_ekfp0m,1578291511.0,"I love sleep. One of the only things in life i still care for to be honest. I can sleep for 14 hours, but i always end up staying up super late so i dont have to start the next day. I usually get 3 or 4 hours of sleep. 

Ive had dreams recently, a few where ive debated suicide in my dreams. One of them i woke up before choosing, and two where i jumped and woke up feeling like i was falling and i emotionally felt drained."
