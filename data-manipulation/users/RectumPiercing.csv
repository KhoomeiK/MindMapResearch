Then what fucking good are they? All they do is tell us ""The team is digesting your feedback"". They never give us any updates on that feedback being ""digested"". They never update us on how that feedback could possibly be implemented or show any real sign that the feedback is even going anywhere.

I'm not gonna coddle them just because they aren't the ones making decisions. If they're being employed to respond to us, and then bungie themselves don't actively take the feedback, then why even hire the community managers? Let's not act like they're paragons of the community holding things together when all they can manage to give us is the same regurgitated answer over and over while the community they're supposed to manage devolves into chaos because people are tired of being ignored.

I still enjoy the game. I just recognize it has serious issues right now, I want to see it improve, but it never will as long as bungie adamantly refuses to accept criticism or feedback, and it never will as long as people keep defending bungie as this small precious indie company with no money.

They need to improve, they're just lazy and/or greedy, and hell, I understand why. They're obviously pumping everything into Destiny 3 because Destiny 2 still has activision's stink all over it. But they can't just write off Destiny 2 at this point because by the time D3 comes out, there'll be no goodwill left.

Maybe they learned from D1, how it was in a good place as it's ""timeline"" ended, and then D2 seemed like a massive downgrade in comparison.
