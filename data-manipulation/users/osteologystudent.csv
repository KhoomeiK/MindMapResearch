bipolar,ffsz9mg,t1_ffros27,1580198856.0,How come?
bipolar,ffsz8nh,t1_ffrk38d,1580198820.0,I've never heard about a psychiatrist coming home to you just for a check up... Not sure if that would make me more relaxed or just stiff as hell. But if it works for you that's great!
bipolar,ffsz4o5,t1_ffrbb3k,1580198669.0,"This is definitely spot in. I'm not afraid of having the diagnosis, but the road to getting one terrifies me. I hate telling people about my feelings and thoughts because it always make me feel ashamed (which really makes no sense, I know). So this was a great message to just remind me that the doctors want the same thing as me, not just to pry around in my brain. Thank you."
bipolar,ffrblcw,t1_ffraz08,1580154661.0,"We also have free health care so I'm very happy about that. The healthpackage sounds like a great thing, but definitely overwhelming. I'm hoping everything works out well for you!"
bipolar,ffrbcrp,t1_ffrb15m,1580154516.0,"You're correct, I use a mood app. But I had not thought about writing down actual symptoms and triggers so thank you!"
