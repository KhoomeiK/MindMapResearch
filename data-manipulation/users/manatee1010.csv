dogs,ffd40lb,t1_ffd1qzq,1579812987.0,"It's something I asked both my dogs' breeders about and neither batted an eye. 

I also asked my large dog's breeder about the prevalence of bloat in her lines and got a very honest answer (two she's bred have bloated and died). Her candid response helped me feel confident she wasn't hiding things about her lines when it came to other topics, plus helped inform my decision to get my pup's stomach tacked.

All dogs die of *something*, and cancer is legitimately a huge issue with this breed. Given those two things, I think as long as you're respectful it is very reasonable to ask."
dogs,ffcon7v,t3_esv236,1579803923.0,"I agree with others who say that there are lots of good things about all of these breeders. There are some gorgeous dogs in these links!

Something that struck me that hasn’t been mentioned yet… this is obviously a breed that is VERY predisposed to cancer, oftentimes even at a pretty young age. Of these four breeders, only one has any substantial reference to the fact that the cancer issue exists and that they’re doing something about it ([http://www.geminigoldenretrievers.com/screening.html](http://www.geminigoldenretrievers.com/screening.html)). 

If it were me I would ask each of these breeders what common causes of deaths are in dogs that they’ve bred; if cancer, I’d be especially curious to ask about average age at development, and what types of cancers have been seen. 

It would really suck to get a beautiful, wonderful dog who passes at 3 or 4 due to hemangio or osteosarcoma. With this breed I would be personally seeking to really stack the deck against that, to the degree that it's possible."
guessthebreed,ffckee4,t3_esrryq,1579801329.0,"Unfortunately it's almost impossible to guess breed at such a young age - breed-specific traits don't usually become clear until closer to 6 months of older.

Do you have any photos of the parents? Those we could guess from.

Alternately, a DNA test would be your best bet for getting an answer sooner. Embark and Wisdom Panel are the two most reliable tests, if you decide to go that route."
DoggyDNA,ffcir0s,t1_ffc2vcu,1579800336.0,"So I agree that many purebred dogs have high COIs, either because the breed has a small gene pool overall, or because of intentional relative matings up close in their pedigrees (linebreeding). There are probably plenty of purebred dogs that have both things driving up COI.

But there’s no reason to think that a high COI *only* happens with purebreds. I'm with [u/PrincipalOak](https://www.reddit.com/user/PrincipalOak) – a high homozygosity (COI) value from Embark means inbreeding, be it intentional or unintentional. 

From what I’ve seen on this sub and IRL, there are loads of inbred mixed breed dogs. It can happen as a function of small feral populations, hoarding situations, and even just plain ol’ irresponsible pet ownership. For example, my own sister had a mutt she failed to spay that had puppies… they kept a male puppy and somehow thought it would know to not breed with its own mother, and were shocked to have a mother/son litter 6 or 8 months down the road. (I know. I know.) If they’d been tested, the puppies in that second litter most likely had COIs/homozygosity values around 25% (the average value for a dog who is the product of parent/offspring mating).

As an aside… I know ""linebreeding"" is a term used by breeders to describe intentional inbreeding that accentuates type... but in terms of what it actually is, [it's still inbreeding](https://www.instituteofcaninebiology.org/uploads/1/9/6/9/19691109/woolliams_2012_influence_of_genetics_and_inbreeding_on_disease.pdf) (see p199 in that article for more discussion). 

Linebreeding can be beneficial from the perspective of cementing type, but it is still [very possible for it to produce the same negative consequences](https://www.instituteofcaninebiology.org/blog/why-all-the-fuss-about-inbreeding-or-why-do-we-have-so-many-genetic-disorders-in-dogs) that any other inbreeding might have.

AskVet,ff9ro6l,t1_ff9m0mo,1579719652.0,"Since it sounds like the major potential physical drivers have been ruled out... a litter box with either [training litter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DJ7QYSH/), or regular litter with an [attractant added](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000PKUUU0), might be worth a try.

Also - what kind of litter box do you have? Top-entry and boxes with doors can be barriers to good litter box habits for some cats, especially as they are.

Is she by any chance declawed?"
