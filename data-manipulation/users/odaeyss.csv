Don't for one minute think that the corruption that led to his suicide went anywhere. They just got better at vetting who could see it.

And the wild west museum in Harrisburg that never came to be, but they sure did find some of the shit bought for it in the former mayor's residence. Reed caught a few hundred charges after he finally left office IIRC.. not really any consequences beyond a blemish on a dying man's record.

Talked about ballistics and all that, how just shooting a gun can show evidence of the earth's rotation and spherical shape.  
I don't think it worked but he stopped pestering me about it, whether due to all the science or the fact that I get all starry-eyed and giddy when I start talking about long-range bullet trajectories. If it works, it works."
