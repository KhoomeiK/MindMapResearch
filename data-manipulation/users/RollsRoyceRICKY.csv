loneliness,fcnpujd,t3_ehxdfu,1577816176.0,"2019 was the worst year ever for me so ain’t nothing to celebrate about.

Last New Years was pathetic too, and prolly the one before that..."
depression,fcmmotx,t1_fcmmj1x,1577781861.0,"It’s just that when something bad happens we recognize and acknowledge it but often fail to notice when something nice happens. But in this case these bad experiences remind us of the value of good times.

Like now when I think about my good times, I didn’t even know when I was living through it how great it was, only when it’s gone and I miss it and unfortunately never experience that again, I realize like wow life was great I should have made something out of it while it was that way.

Just praying for another chance and now I know I’ll navigate better."

depression,fclnoa7,t1_fclnf0y,1577752069.0,"Yeah, I get it, gotta live with all the shit that we’ve done, consider that as the punishment of doing it. Just know no matter how shitty your situation is, you still have control and if you don’t decide to give up then there is still more to life. It’s funny cuz I’m saying this to myself as much as I’m saying this to you.

Times are hard, don’t know what to do now but slowly everything will at least make sense and one day we’ll find this life we live, worth living"
depression,fclmwme,t3_ehunym,1577751543.0,"I know how you feel, the pain runs deep but take it by the day and just know no matter how you think of it, what has happened cannot be changed and now you gotta figure out some things in life to get back to being happy.

That’s what I’m trying, it’s hard and feels like there is no end to the tunnel but moving on is the only option.

Best of luck and my spirit is with you!"
loneliness,fc75soj,t1_fc5sfmn,1577498309.0,"I exactly know how you feel and I wish a sentence or two could soothe or heal our pain but that’s not happening.

The good news is that things never stay the same, so hope and work towards making the future changes in your life be positive ones. 

I’m not religious but I like to pray for everyone. It also helps my mental health."
depression,fc6c56w,t3_egdm43,1577477128.0,I really don’t want to feel like this too but it’s m almost there and it makes life so hard smh. I will pray for you my friend
loneliness,fc654ul,t3_eg5j9p,1577472495.0,"I go through the exact same thing. So what I figured (at least for myself) is that I don’t really miss my Ex but it’s the feeling of being loved and the feeling of affection and intimacy is what I truly miss, rather than a particular person. 

Try and find someone that loves you. I still haven’t and it’s been over a year for me too but I have my hopes up and so should you. Cheers!"
