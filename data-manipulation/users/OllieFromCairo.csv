footballmanagergames,ffgcznb,t1_ffg700h,1579903496.0,"Not really. It only pays $90 mil for fourth place. The group stage of the CL pays $20 mil alone, even if you lose every game, and at least $45 mil if all you do is make the round of 16. By getting bounced early in the CL one year, they could easily have lost $20 mil in expected revenue, which could make them fail FFP if they were playing close to the line, especially if they had a ton of future fees come due on transfers. 

Then, losing the $45 mil they had expected by getting booted from the CL was too much of a burden to bear."

I think it’s fair to say our tastes in this regard are absolute polar opposite"
rpg,ffg0hpe,t1_fffyoss,1579895806.0,"It was a lot better than first though. 

Everyone had their favorite house rules for first because it was literally unplayable as written. 

Second has its questionable design choices, but it’s coherent."
rpg,fffs5dx,t1_fffpk2i,1579890617.0,"I've been running a 3.5/Pathfinder Al-Qadim game for the last 9 years.  There is actually a fair amount of work involved in converting the setting.  (Fortunately, Paizo did a LOT of the hard yards with their Qadira supplements.)"
rpg,fffrnes,t1_fffmal7,1579890311.0,"I have the original 2E players handbook right next to me, in fact!  The straight 3d6 rolls is the default, and all other options are listed as only with DM permission. 

That said, literally nobody used that default option."
brexit,fffixws,t1_fffilu7,1579884958.0,"Because Brexit is an incredible lesson in populist politics and what you can convince people to believe. 

For example, 18 months ago, EVERYONE agreed a no-deal Brexit was a terrible idea and assured the public would not happen, and then people started shouting GET BREXIT DONE until they convinced people that was a sensible thing to say and here we are. 

It’s amazing."

footballmanagergames,fffhgvk,t1_fffetkm,1579884051.0,"It’s kind of my fault. I managed them for a few years, got them promoted to Serie A and got a stadium built to support them financially sound at that level."
footballmanagergames,fffevel,t1_fffcqg3,1579882442.0,"Don’t be. Bayern and Dortmund have won all but 5 Bundesliga titles since 1997. So, 38 out of 43."
