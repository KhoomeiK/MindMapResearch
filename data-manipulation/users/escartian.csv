todayilearned,ffg00tu,t1_fffz1se,1579895518.0,"12000 is still entirely too much for someone who likely isn't moving much. 2000 would be a lot for a bed ridden person unless they are exceptionally large. For example, the Rock ""only""' eats about 5000 calories a day but leads an active lifestyle and is a fairly large man. (Around ten pounds of food a day). 

Ultimately, the hospital doesn't want to force a feeding tube in patients that can eat but if they aren't eating enough (which is why 1200 might make sense as it is lower than bmr but not by all that much most likely) then to keep the patient alive and from deteriorating they'd have to put in the feeding tube."
todayilearned,fffxglf,t1_fffvmhj,1579893929.0,12000 calories is only 12 Calories tbh which is incredibly low. Either way (most people aren't pedantic enough to know capital C calories is kilocalories which is what we generally use in nutrition labels) the number is probably wrong lol. Probably should be 1200

todayilearned,fekcj46,t1_fejzyzf,1579197194.0,"Actually Stalin did it. Trump only got elected because the Russian Empire fell, the ussr went to war in Afghanistan causing the USA to go there which caused 9/11 which got Trump elected. I'm pretty sure this was Julius Caesar's plan all along though. You see..."

bestof,fdnq33w,t1_fdmqar2,1578590710.0,"Not to defend Trump but if you're talking about the Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City there are a number of causes for the failure. NY, PA, and DE, legalized casinos in their states setup the people who would travel to AC for casinos are less likely to go. Hurricane Sandy screwed the place up too. While the city has improved since the hurricane, AC is basically a shithole and outside of a select few, most of the casinos are struggling or closing. Cut your losses and close down/sell. Add the fact that the competition is high there, it's not actually an easy business to run (but a good way for the owners to launder money)."

newjersey,fd055t2,t1_fcz7bj2,1578113780.0,"The stats are less meaningless then your anecdotal evidence. Statistics are only lies because of cherry picking of evidence and p hacking the quote you gave is typically a joke statisticians give and while there is truth to any joke, ultimately it's a joke. There is need to have skepticism but outright ignoring all statistics denies any ability to do much of any analysis and quite a bit of scientific research too - medicine and pharmacology, economy, machine learning,  to name a few disciplines. Otherwise you can disregard everything, nothing matters so why bother discussing if you are already set it your beliefs and see any and all stats as lies. If you have statistics that show I'm wrong and validate your beliefs then I'd accept that for a discussion. Right now you're basically saying ""I chose not to believe the facts you present because statistics are all lies but I won't bother to show facts counter, except my anecdotal evidence to your point because statistics are lies and I don't believe them."" Anecdotal evidence is even worse than statistics when it comes to the potential for lying. That's also why I have included the change over time. The stats are using the same ""lying"" metrics. Things are better now than 10 years ago. It might not be that way for you or people you know but as a whole the nation and NJ are better off now. It's your choice to ignore the stats. 

Understand, I'm not here to defend or attack. Just here to present the facts as they are. Not trying to convince you of anything or ""win"" a discussion. I've nothing to gain or lose here (except my time). Ultimately up to you what you want to believe."
newjersey,fcvy78l,t1_fcumn65,1578012800.0,"Not the recruiter here, but that's a loaded question and you know it. Also anecdotal evidence is still anecdotal. Too small a sample size.

Here's the statistics however. National unemployment is at a low 3.5% as of November 2019. In NJ it is 3.4%, lower than the national average. (Percentages for December haven't been posted yet)


For additional context, in January of 2019
Nation: 4.0 %
NJ: 4.0%

Post recession around (2009-2011) unemployment was over 9% both nationally and in NJ.

The question isn't about jobs. There are plenty of jobs and you yourself have or have had one in the past year. It's more a question of ""but are they well paying jobs?"" And when it comes to average income, NJ is higher than the national average so yes in general the pay is better here."
science,fcu52g1,t1_fctzupe,1577972737.0,It's an exaggeration but not by too much. Average speed is probably closer to 10-15 mph. Highly depends on time of day and location of course.
