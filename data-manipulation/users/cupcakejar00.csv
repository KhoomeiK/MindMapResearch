I mean you have this movement that says it’s okay to be promiscuous, which isn’t a good thing for really anyone, when you look at the psychology behind it and the results of that type of lifestyle(stds, pregnancy, etc.) And it keeps pushing the narrative that women can do what ever a man can (and the thing is that a woman can, but with in her own biological limits, I will Never be Able to do more pushups then most healthy males) and there’s a push for the media to be better, when the media just sucks at it and then ruins entire movies bc of it. 
And then you have the #metoo movement, which started out as good thing, until some women used it and started making false accusations. And with that real victims are being scrutinized more. Completely turning the movement backwards. 
And the entire community makes the claim of patriarchy, which the US isn’t a patriarchal society. 
And in family court, women always walk out with the most benefits. Full custody like 88% time and alimony. 
Most universities are female"

But why is it hard for women to get in IT? Statistically women aren’t as good in the maths and sciences so they can’t, theres a similar issue in the army with combat roles and females not meeting the physical standards. So is it bc they’re females or bc statistically they aren’t as suited.

There’s not a lot of females in the military especially not officers. I’ve only met 3.

AskFeminists,fffxsk8,t1_ffffmqn,1579894136.0,"I mean I’ll agree, obviously there is still sexism, and the military does try to address it (we have seen a downward trend) and I’ll argue that the hardest part of being female in the military is that they try to treat women as equal while still expressing “ohhh you’re a lady!” And then subordinates not taking you seriously and your commanders judging you as a female. But honestly there is nothing you can do about it. I’m not blind, but some stuff is just the individuals being sexist.

AskFeminists,fffx6ai,t1_fffdqa0,1579893752.0,I mean in my experience the push for females in the military made them want more so they made it easier. And it’s not like women are better than men or more valuable. It was just good PR I guess. but what do you mean by the society bit?

And people need to be looking for profitable degrees. Music theory is much less profitable than an Engineering degree. People need to make wise choices when making important life decisions. 
And in the health care world you can only have 2 of 3; universal, fast, or quality. Not all three. And in America we have speed and quality. So that means in other nations they lack speed or quality. Which are crucial. This model shows why the US develops the most vaccines and why many of the worlds elites come to the US for major surgery.

PoliticalHumor,ff56q3x,t1_ff55bko,1579581815.0,"Eh, I would never bet 100% on something like that. There are issues with free healthcare. Such as: less incentive for people to become doctors (less pay bc it’s free & malpractice insurance is expensive), more wait times, like months, and less individualized care. And in the US’s case we have a severe obesity problem which already put a major strain on tax payers. They use the healthcare system more than most and take more specialized care and more people, and some are unemployed due to weight issues. 
Free college: lessens the value of the degree and after 12th you don’t need the additional education. You can go into any manual labor job or go to a trade school. 
Day care I already made my claim, I understand the dislike of that opinion.

It’s a hustle, it’s hard work, and it’s dedication. It’s waking everywhere to save it. It’s utilizing “expired” foods from work to cut food costs. It’s not shopping, it’s leaving cheap. It’s waking up at 5am and going to bed at 11. It sounds rough bc it is. It’s not like the disposable income fell in my lap. But you do that while your young, give it 3 years, and you’ll build up a sizable savings account.

I will agree that many don’t have that disposable income. But I also think to many people pay for things they don’t need. I’m a college student so I’m very frugal. I don’t waste a penny, but I see the way my peers and friends spend theirs in a very..... bad way. And then they complain about not making bills. Well no shit, you use Uber eats every night. 
Everyone has to have T.Vs, latest fashion, all these things, that they can’t afford, but if they cut the BS and took budgeting seriously, many could create a big enough savings over time to diversify their portfolio, and move up.
