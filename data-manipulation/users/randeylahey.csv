Might be off my original numbers, but I don't want to doxx myself, and I used one from my work's webpage.
 https://www.calculator.net/loan-calculator.html?cloanamount=10000&cloanterm=3&cloantermmonth=0&cinterestrate=10&ccompound=monthly&cpayback=month&x=81&y=15#amortized-result"
nfl,fesp907,t1_fesjm1g,1579367565.0,"Gonna lead off by leaning on hockey, because I'm more comfortable there and it has some unique challenges.  Only thing that really 'counts' is final score, ergo goals.  Both teams together usually total 3-7 goals a game so they are really rare.  So what they dig in for is 'what should result in goals?'.  Well, shots should result in goals about 10% of the time.  They've been looking at that for 40 years now.  And you can't shoot the puck unless you have the puck.  So the big revolution in hockey analytics has been around basic concepts like 'we should hold the puck more' and 'we should play our best players more.'  Revolutionary shit, right?

Head back to football.  We still want to add up to that final score.  So if I'm on offence did my last play add to how many points I'd expect to score?  How much?  And then how much did each dude contribute?  So you look at Expected Points Added.  And most plays are going to add a miniscule portion of a point.  So you divide that miniscule portion by the players on the field weighted by their impact on the play.  In all fairness, a weak side wideout on a strong side passing play isn't one of the major contributors.  Truth is most of those 11 guys aren't having much of an impact. 

So you run those analytics play over play all year, and you wind up with how good 'should' this team be."
AskReddit,fesjmc6,t1_fesea6m,1579365881.0,"This thread is giving me a headache and making me worry about the state of our collective financial literacy again.

Simple interest is just calculated on the original principal.  You wouldn't have to have a final balloon payment, you could pay the $13,000 back with 36 $361.11 payments.

""Typically if you make payments on a simple interest loan your principal changes over time with each payment and interest paid still works out cheaper.""  Your interest works out cheaper on a compound loan because after each payment they recalculate your interest based off of the remaining principal.  This act is called, brace yourself for it, 'compounding your interest.'  Loans generally compound monthly, mortgages are traditionally semi-annual.  That actually does make a difference, but it's pretty minor.

I've never even heard of a simple interest loan because it's that bad of an idea.  If you want to find one, I'd suggest some kind of payday loan place."
nfl,fesfeyv,t1_fers1hp,1579364576.0,"You're kind of making my case for me. 11 guys specializing the roles limits the number of functions a guys 'should be' doing.

A wideout is running a route or blocking, with a non-zero chance at a catch and possession play.  If 'A' did you run the route properly?  If 'B' did you get beaten on your block?  If you had a chance to make a catch did you make it?  Not all throws are created equal, what are the odds you should have made the catch?  Use that to weight it.  If you made the catch did you add value with your run after the catch.  Lather, rinse and repeat for the other 21 guys on the field.

Compare that to hockey (I'm more a hockey guy) where every individual can have multiple responsibilites at any given time, and your role can switch abrubtly, with no stoppage in real time, and scoring events are rare.  I could be in the attack zone, make a dumb turnover, and have the play back in my end in about 3-6 seconds, and now I have a whole new set of jobs.

Not trying to be a dick here, I enjoy the dialogue.  I just think football would be relatively easy to pull analytics from.  For what it's worth my ranking of the big 5 in NA team sports from easiest to hardest would be: baseball, football, basketball, hockey, soccer.  I could maybe be talked into flipping football and basketball."

Everything about football is analytics, its just a matter of how basic or simple you want to go.  Total yards is an analytic.  Sacks is an analytic.  Completion percentage is an analytic.  Dropped pass percentage is an analytic.  The math keeps getting harder the deeper you dig, but that doesn't mean analysis doesn't have value."
nfl,ferehul,t1_fer4wur,1579352967.0,"Football would be super easy to pull analytics from.  Every play has a stoppage, so there's an origin and a result.  Did the play result in an increase or a decrease to our chances of winning?

AskReddit,fer7u22,t1_fer69gy,1579350913.0,"Simple interest is based on the principal amount.  A $10,000 loan for 3 years at 10% is $1,000 per year.  Total cost of borrowing is $3,000.  Run a loan calculator on a 3 year loan with the same rate and principal and you get a payment of $322.67 which totals $11,616.12 for an interest cost of $1,616.12 over the life of the loan.

Compounding would work different on a credit card because you can capitalize the interest if you're blowing off payments.  But then you're a real dummy.
