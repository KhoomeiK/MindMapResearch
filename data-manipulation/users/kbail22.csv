MadeMeSmile,ffidelf,t3_etqijb,1579971215.0,My high school softball coach did this for when we would run out of the dugout for lineups. She's still doing it nearly 15 years later.
myfavoritemurder,fffs43e,t1_fffmc84,1579890594.0,"Oh dang, I did not read that 90 days part. There goes any sort of argument that it is being used for law enforcement."
myfavoritemurder,fffm22i,t1_fffloho,1579886881.0,"We must have skimmed the same article then. My original comment should have ""law enforcement only"" instead to make it more clear like you have made it."
myfavoritemurder,fffjto7,t1_fffgw6q,1579885501.0,You are correct. He developed the app to be used by law enforcement and they said they've been using it to identify people. I don't know how that doesn't fall into the wrong person's hands though.
AnnArbor,fegc48a,t3_eowur9,1579087133.0,Ours is 18 weeks and needs the socialization and play too. Is your puppy UTD on vaccinations?
aww,fe9t8ff,t1_fe9p7zp,1578941295.0,"No, no, my mistake. I was just trying to empathize with the adoption situation. It's dumb how hard it is to adopt."
aww,fe7ihe0,t1_fe65jqt,1578914979.0,"Sorry, those were all rhetorical. I was just commenting on how hard it was to adopt."
aww,fe41g5o,t1_fe2syt5,1578854870.0,"Yeah, it almost seems like that's the third party website and you have to contact them directly. Like a newspaper posting. You wouldn't contact the newspaper for something you found in there."
aww,fe419n4,t1_fe2ipm3,1578854811.0,"Adoption agencies or shelters. The local humane society was like ""do you have money? Take the dog"" but we didn't find a dog we liked. 

But the adoption agencies had dozens of applicants and they evaluated them and determined which family it would go to.

I don't know that was just my experience."
aww,fe26cjd,t1_fe20kgf,1578834974.0,"What about you applied for the dog but then they pick applications from a pile?
Or you've never had a pet?
Or you don't have a vet referral because you've never had a pet?
Or the shelter just straight up never responds to your application? 
Or you both work?
Or you don't have a back yard suitable for a dog?

I feel the grief too, but I happened to apply for the right one and got her. But I can totally see why people are forced to buy with how crazy this application process gets."
news,fdhvcn8,t1_fdhk4q4,1578430814.0,I hate your thorough reply cause it has made me increasingly more angry for something I didn't know about previously.
news,fdhj7v7,t1_fdh6p6p,1578423794.0,Now how is that homeowner not getting in trouble? I feel like that should be a two way street!
news,fdh5bvy,t1_fdgv2hs,1578415710.0,"Wait, so all those signs I saw were bullshit that were on the beach? There were a million people on the public part and then signs where people's properties started so they stopped at that point. I thought that seemed dumb.

It looks like you can walk as long as you're in the water, but you can't hang out in the sand? I dunno."
Dogtraining,fdfe0qp,t1_fdfb7kk,1578359489.0,It says it's not longer available on that website. Found another one?
holdmycosmo,fcn4o8f,t1_fcmkklf,1577803169.0,Southerners will put a line dance to any song with a beat.
Dogtraining,fckg0qj,t1_fckd04q,1577724500.0,"Every time she has been chill and not playing or being yelled at so it didn't entirely make sense. I didn't know if it was attention seeking since we weren't directly giving her any attention. 
We do say no when we see it which is every time thus far."
aww,fcinjk7,t1_fcifzm2,1577665568.0,Thank you for the thorough answer.
aww,fci2374,t1_fchc2b9,1577656819.0,Any advice on where to go to eliminate this behavior? I'm dealing with it now with a 4 month old lab mix and we just say no when she nibbles or try and distract with a toy.
Dogtraining,fc6yq3z,t1_fc6jbdi,1577492946.0,Please elaborate on crate games. I would like more information.
crochet,fc5j5zm,t1_fc3unhy,1577459043.0,Do you still have the link??
batonrouge,fbu2h1f,t3_eed7n5,1577106082.0,"I remember my mom keeping a revolver under the seat when she would pick me up from school. 

My aunt ended up living really close to him so that was a scary thing to find out.

With the second serial killer in the area, it made things terrifying for women at the time."
