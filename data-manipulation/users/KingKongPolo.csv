AskReddit,fdqtbjs,t1_fdpf4mh,1578674431.0,"??? [Have you looked at the Shanghai composite index?](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/$CHSC/interactive-chart). The Chinese economy is contracting. The tariffs put pressure on Chinese manufacturers/exporters because it literally limits their ability to sell to Americans competitively because it skews price against them. That *is* the point of a tariff. 

Last time I checked (about 5 minutes ago), we're still making new highs. They're not. That is taking a hardline. 

The USMCA is not the same as NAFTA. It's a modernized, updated version of NAFTA. One of the biggest changes is that a larger portion of auto manufacturing has to be done in the U.S. (around ~176k more factory jobs in exchange for slightly more expensive products). Also, unlike NAFTA, this addresses digital trade. How could NAFTA have done that in 1994?"

Also - that doesn’t change the fact that the rate of growth has dramatically increased under the trump administration. You can only suck Barack’s dick for so long dude. 

The bilateral trade agreements established with Japan and the EU were very beneficial to the US. I’m also very happy he took a hardline with the Chinese. Also, the House Democrats trying to hold the USMCA deal hostage because it’s good for Trump is childish af."
