**STEALTH:**  Action

Usually none. Normally, **you make a Stealth check as part of movement**, so it doesn’t take a separate action. However, **using Stealth immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above) is a** [**move action**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions).

*So getting in? No. Keeping it? Yes, it requires a move action.*

&#x200B;

**2. From the same Stealth Entry:**

**Create a Diversion to Hide:** You can use Bluff to allow you to use Stealth. A successful Bluff check can give you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Stealth check while people are aware of you.

As there's no specifics, we go to the bluff skill under [Feint](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/Bluff/#Feint_in_Combat) (or even [inconspicuous](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/Bluff/#Perform_Inconspicuous_Action)):

"" The DC of this check is equal to 10 + your opponent’s base attack bonus + your opponent’s Wisdom modifier. If your opponent is trained in Sense Motive, the DC is instead equal to 10 + your opponent’s Sense Motive bonus, if higher. ""

OR

""**Check**: Your Bluff check is opposed by observers’ Sense Motive checks. You can’t attempt the check if your very presence is suspicious (which you could prevent by altering your appearance with the Disguise skill).""

&#x200B;

*So yes, Wisdom OR Sense Motive, is the mob is trained in the latter.*

&#x200B;

**3. Looking at the** [**Sniping**](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/Stealth/#Sniping) **Entry:**

""If you’ve already successfully used Stealth at least 10 feet from your target, you can **make one ranged attack** and then immediately use Stealth again. You take a –20 penalty on your Stealth check to maintain your obscured location.""

Then further, we look at the [Master Sniper Feat](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/master-sniper-combat/):

""**Benefit(s)**: **While hiding, you can make two ranged attacks at your highest** **attack bonus** **as a** **full-round action** **and then immediately use** **Stealth** **agai**n. You take the normal penalties on your Stealth check to remain hidden. Effects that modify sniping apply to this full-round action. These attack rolls take a –2 penalty.""

&#x200B;

Hope this helps... I'd invest in an Orc Hornbow, and pick up Manyshot, as your first ""dice roll"" is two arrows. In addition, picking up a single level of Illusian Archer/Divine Marksman to give you Bullseye shot at Lvl 1 may help.

If it’s any other reason, then do this: limit the amount of gold available at a town.

In 5e, you can move around an enemy with no problem, so long as you're in their threatened area. This is **NOT** the case in PF--moving more than one square/5 ft will provoke an opportunity attack from the enemy, much the same way as if you left a threatened range in 5e.

You can take a ""5 foot step"", which does just that, but it takes up your entire move action. You effectively can kite this way if you have to be in melee, just watch out for people with the ""[Step Up](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/step-up-combat/)"" feat.

Your numbers will get MUCH bigger than you've seen in 5e. This is normal.

You will get a feat every odd level, which are less powerful than those in 5e, but do more things.

Multiclassing is much easier, but offers more ""trap"" options. You don't need a 13 or 14 in the primary stat, and you instead add both class' bonuses to your saves.

It may behoove you to start as a [Musket Master Gunslinger](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger/archetypes/paizo-gunslinger-archetypes/musket-master/) first, and then go into Gun Chemist--most people will take five levels of gunslinger for Dex-to-Damage, but this is purely from a numbers game. With that, I HIGHLY recommend you go Musket Master first, and then multiclass--Getting rapid reload: musket for free is a game changer, and drops the amount of levels you have to waste a feat to be viable at one. Your first two feats should be Rapid Reload and Point Blank Shot. Look at guides from there, or the list of feats that /u/hagiologist listed in their first paragraph.

About the AP:

I'm currently running this AP, and it's been known as a meat grinder, so depending on how your GM is, be careful, read the [Player's Guide](https://paizo.com/products/btpy98lf), Androfan as a language and the Technologist feat are your friends. It's generally a good idea to look at the traits given by the guide and take one.
