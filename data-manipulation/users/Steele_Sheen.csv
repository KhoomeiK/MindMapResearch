I know it's your first time being responsible for your own pet so you may be feeling like this is a lot, but as soon as you're comfortable do try to get a 2nd cat, or at least a companion pet for her. domesticated pets are very similar to humans now, when they don't have anybody else similar to them they get lonely. also having another cat would take some of the demand for attention off of you since there's someone else they can play with. and then you'd have double the cuddles so it's a win win 😸🤩😸"

note: if she's the only cat in the house she could get lonely 😿, so consider a 2nd cat, it's also easier when they have a companion they wouldn't pester you for attention or boredom as much 😸"

marvelstudios,fb2n390,t3_eb3m1o,1576454045.0,"first of all: CONGRATZ DUDE!!! 👏
secondly: that is fantastic work you did there, you're using your degree already 😁👍

gotta wonder though, was it heavy wearing that? I'm just wondering if it falls off too easily because of the added weight."
