educationalgifs,fdfxlvd,t1_fdfc4rb,1578373023.0,"Incrementally. The ones that looked more like a caterpillar when they got into a snail eye had a better chance to get eaten by a bird and pass on their genes. Generation after generation after generation the ones that looked most appealing to birds got to pass on their genes, becoming more attractive with each generation.

Probably the same thing happened with the brain control. One day a parasite moved the snail just a little bit, making it more of a target, and each generation the ones who controlled it the best passed on their genes.

When I think about it, it makes sense how it could happen over such huge spans of time.

It’s still crazy as shit though. Thank god humans don’t have any parasites like that."
