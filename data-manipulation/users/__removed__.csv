I'm sure you could just get one of the squirt bottle types. 

I was really searching for a bidet for by home. I was going to use a squirt bottle, but decided to get something more permanent and easier to use. 

For the home, I ended up getting this model because I have a small bathroom and this is the only one I found without a giant control panel hanging off of the side. This just has an inconspicuous switch on the side. Very hidden, guests don't even know it's a bidet.

Day session 11am in Melbourne is 7pm in the states. Coverage actually starts at primetime, 8pm. 

The only thing ESPN can show is the start of the day session, the 11am matches, which are usually the crappy matches. Every tournament puts the good matches on the night session, which is, like, 2am in the states. 

I've noticed that, for whatever reason, the women typically play first, men play in the night session. It is what it is. 

There's already been 4 completed women's matches tonight - Halep is playing now, so that's 5 women's matches. 

The Monfils / Gulbis match is the first and only men's match so far tonight...

Even then, that's #10 Monfils versus unseeded Gulbis. For a casual tennis fan, not the most exciting match-up. Especially compared to Pliskova, Kerber, Halep, all top players...

TLDR: due to the time difference, ESPN is showing the 11am day session matches, which tend to be the least exciting. There's only one men's match on right now anyways.

***EDIT: Fritz / Thiem just started. Especially since Fritz is American, I'd rather be watching that. Maybe they'll go to that next after Halep finishes this."

Millman got an early mini-break to go up 3-0, which, as it turned out, was the difference most of the breaker. Federer couldn't get that mini-break back.

And then later in the breaker, Fed gave another mini-break up! So now Fed is down two mini-breaks. 

At that point I thought Fed was done for sure. 

At 8-4: Fed's serve, which he held to be 8-5, then, fine. 

So Millman had the match on his racket with 2 serves at 8-5. 

I remember thinking literally the only way Fed gets out of this is if he gets both the mini-breaks back RIGHT HERE. Then it would be 8-7, back on serve. But if Millman gets one of the two, he'll be at ""9"", and then have several match points, which will change everything. The nerves, caution, and strategy all change with match points. So the only way Fed avoids that is to win both on Millman's serve. 

Once you get back on serve, then, Fed would be up 9-8 *on serve*. Even though technically on serve so there shouldn't be an issue, Fed would technically have a match point, then, and serving from the ""down"" position to stay in it is never easy. 

And sure enough, that's what happened. 

The entire tiebreak was won at 8-5. To some, that seems like ""the middle"" or not an important point, but if you're going to win, it has to be **now**. 

It's like how ""30-all is the most important point"", because after 30-all you'll either have a game point or a break point. 

8-5 was the most important point. 

Two mini-breaks to get it back on serve at 8-7.... Hold your serve to go up 9-8.... Now you have a match point and the pressure is on the other guy again.

Fed wins."
