AskReddit,fh8ttmo,t3_f1whe8,1581367239.0,No clue but.. whatever.  I'm more worried about the pain of dying than the after.  I wasn't here for a longtime ...
Wellthatsucks,fh862tl,t1_fh85qpi,1581352837.0,You have no idea what you're saying.   I don't care that you aren't American... the internet is free and whomever you know in your life that uses this term is an asshole.  Someone lost their kid and fought to get this passed so others could be saved and you use it for Weather?
Wellthatsucks,fh85vgc,t1_fh85k82,1581352708.0,"I don't think you understand what you're saying.  This has nothing to do with that.   This is actually a specific term to help ensure that children and missing persons are found alive when a notification of a kidnapping etc are reported... it's named for a murdered child, so I am not sure why you think this.  Unless for some odd reason the name Amber in the UK means weather, I think your rude little comment is insensitive and moronic."
Wellthatsucks,fh85l75,t1_fh854wq,1581352530.0,Amber Alert was created due to the murder of a child named Amber Hagerman.  Not different.  Quite rude to use for something mundane.  Educate yourself.
Wellthatsucks,fh85hhh,t1_fh857dd,1581352463.0,"This just in, OP shouldn't use this term to describe something such as a weather alert for high winds.   It doesn't matter if different countries have different terms.   This is a specific term, that shouldn't be used in this manner."
Wellthatsucks,fh85ctx,t1_fh859vi,1581352382.0,"Right, and OP is misusing something very specific that started due to the murder of a child."

Wellthatsucks,fh84xb1,t3_f1slmr,1581352112.0,"You should google Amber Hagerman, and maybe don't use that term for stupid shit that has nothing to do with a child abduction/missing person."
