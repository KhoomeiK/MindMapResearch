My ACD was crypto orchid. One testicle didn’t descend- Basically a spay and a neuter in one procedure. She flipped him over, poked and prodded, and said no-biggie, lookin forward to it (real teaching moment). No complications and zero complaints. 

That’s the secret. In my locale, that clinic is basically Vet Surgical finishing school. They line up a few dozen dogs and cats every morning and run an assembly line through the afternoon. Vids exist of that type operation. One person knocks em out. Another flips em, pins em, and shaves em. Next station is cut and sutures. And they’re kicked on to post OP. 

I turned around and ran a cat through there as well. That feline had a seizure issue that I let them know about. No issues. Was gonna run my second dog through there that we’d rescued. They found her previous spay scar once shaved (they knew to look first) and refunded me for the procedure they never had to do. I’ve recommended them and will continue to. 10/10

Edit to add: My neighborhood vet wanted a mortgage payment or more once he heard crypto-orchid. $400 would have been a deal from them."

Japan completely re-evaluated their direction after getting annihilated in 39 and having their oil flow stopped by Britain and the US. See above.
