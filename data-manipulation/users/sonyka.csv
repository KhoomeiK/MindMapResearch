insanepeoplefacebook,ffg7tar,t1_fff43sw,1579900319.0,"Yeahhh, that's about what I thought. Disappointing, but not unexpected. 

I don't have a ton of time for this (work break), but:

• Your argument seems to entirely consist of (deliberate?) misunderstanding, declaring things ridiculous, and simply restating your opinion. FYI, ""it's wrong/you’re wrong"" isn't actually can argument.

• My view is not based on the legal system, it's the other way around. Read it again.

• I don't think that *should* be considered double murder. It is *because the subject is very emotional,* not because that makes logical sense. (The law doesn't define morality, it *reflects* it. And not always perfectly. Ideally, there is logical rigor—but we don't always live up to our ideals. Still, we generally consider it worth it to try.)

• The slippery-slope accusation is incorrect (again, you really should [read](http://www.csun.edu/~dgw61315/fallacies.html#Slippery%20slope) [up](https://www.thoughtco.com/slippery-slope-logical-fallacy-1692105) on these things), and frankly pretty rich coming from someone who seems to be suggesting blood donation is typically fatal.

&nbsp;      
Here's what I'm actually saying: telling people what to do with their bodies undermines bodily ownership. And I'm saying there are  immediate logical and practical consequences to doing that which anti-choicers never address/consider. Let us review. Does your body belong to you or not? If it does, no one can have access to it without your permission (this is the basis of the concept of property). If it doesn't, then they can. Agreed? 

Now, if some people *don't* own their bodies by default, then *no one* owns their body by default (the concept of equal protection). Still with me? 

Okay. So if we don't own our bodies— if that can be overridden because say, someone will die without access to it, or because you somehow ""owe"" access to someone else— why wouldn't I be able to take your blood (or bone marrow, or eye, or kidney)? After all, *it doesn't particularly belong to you.* If need was enough to override ownership (which seems to be baked into many anti-choice stances) why couldn't a surgeon with a dying patient just grab anyone off the street and take what's needed? On what basis would they protest?

Again, this argument isn't based on law. I'm pointing out that much of law *is based on this argument.*  
Think about it. 
   
In order to make your position work while also maintaining consistency, we'd have to rewrite, among other things, our entire theory of property. And also do something about the concept of equal protection. Both of which would bring on a bunch of VERY tricky philosophical problems. (To pick just one: in a world where you don't exclusively own *the physical vessel of your life/consciousness,* what even is murder?). If you haven't considered them, your position is incomplete, and you may want to think it through some more.

&nbsp;     
Oh and not to blow your mind even further but, related: I submit there's no such thing as a blanket ""right to life."" The only life you're entitled to is the life your own body can provide. If your body sucks at living, that sucks (truly). But you still can't take someone else's. Not unless they give it.

Consider: Let's say I stab you in the liver, and now you're going to die without a new one. As it stands, you can't take mine— even though I'm clearly responsible for your need. You can prosecute and jail me, but you can't have mine without my permission. Not even if I'm dead.     
Why do you think that is?      
Really think about it.

Similarly, if someone is *born* with a nonfunctional heart, that's fucking tragic. Obviously. And of course we'd do what we could to help because jfc we're not monsters. Nevertheless, barring someone's generosity, *that person will die* (or as some would incorrectly put it, be ""allowed"" to die). Not because anyone denied them any ""right,"" but because their body— the only body they have any rights to— cannot sustain their life. Just like you and your slashed-up liver. Just like a fetus."

Fetuses aren't denied autonomy, they just don't have it. By nature.

&nbsp;     
And u/JinxQuinn's argument isn't dumb, it's a classic illustration of the idea that people own their bodies. Your physical body belongs to you and *only* you, and *no one* has any ""rights"" to it without your permission. An idea that's not just widely accepted, but fundamental to a lot of our legal system/society. You should read up on it.      

Or just think about it. Think about how a society without that would work. For one thing, if our bodies are public property, get ready to rewrite the murder laws. If not the entire concept of murder. For another, if people don't own their bodies, why *can't* the king take your blood? Or a surgeon? Or a desperate parent? What stops any rando from commandeering any of your organs? On what basis would you protest? It's not like they belong to you. 

See how quickly that's a problem? And we've barely scratched the surface! People have *no idea* what they're getting into when they want to mess with this. It's not like, some minor statute. (Not to mention, that logical road takes you right back to a pro-abortion place anyway. Except this time with more dystopia. The plan is not thought through.)"

>Because the fairgrounds are walled in at the entrance, I couldn't see what was going on inside as I walked up to the registration desk. […] Nothing prepared me for what I saw when I walked through the gates. The contrast to the calm on the other side of the wall was stunning. The scene inside was surreal. I felt as if I'd stepped into a movie set or a war zone. Hundreds of people, many of them soaking wet from the rain that had been falling all morning, were waiting in lines that stretched out of view. As I walked around, I noticed that some of those lines led to barns and cinder block buildings with row after row of animal stalls, where doctors and nurses were treating patients. Other people were being treated by dentists under open-sided tents. Many were lying on gurneys on rain-soaked pavement. Except for curtains serving as makeshift doors on the animal stalls, there was little privacy. 

>And unlike health fairs I had seen in shopping centers and malls, this was a real clinic. Dentists were pulling teeth and filling cavities, optometrists were examining eyes for glaucoma and cataracts, doctors and nurses were doing Pap smears and mammograms, surgeons were cutting out skin cancers, and gastroenterologists were conducting sigmoidoscopies. Huge amounts of medications were being dispensed.

Yup, as I thought. The defs for wet-the-adjective from [OED](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/wet), [MW](https://www.yourdictionary.com/wet), and [AHD](https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=wet) are practically identical.

Also I'm not sure what to make of the first bit here. Seems to be: CHP polices high-crime areas harder, and since those areas are often blacker, it follows that they'd be stopping more black people there. Leaving aside the obvious meta, now it's my turn to be dubious: fwiw, I highly doubt there are enough of those areas to explain the statewide disparity.

Have you considered taking your own advice? It's not like this is the only relevant data available. It's just the latest in a long string of statistics that generally point in the same direction, eg: 

* traffic stop reports from all over the country showing black drivers being stopped hugely disproportionately, but getting relatively few citations

* the giant NYC stop-and-frisk dataset (where blacks were searched way more often— even after five years of their own data showed it was *whites* who were most likely to have drugs and weapons)

* the post-S&F outcomes data (in which BP received significantly less leniency than WP at every stage of the system)

* the well documented ""invisible infraction"" phenomenon (where black drivers get pulled over, then ticketed/arrested only for invisible violations like drug possession or driving without a license— how'd the cops know??)

* multiple federal investigations that have found PDs around the country disproportionately (sometimes illegally) targeting BP

* the lack of evidence tying poverty to traffic violations (nb, the vast majority of black Americans are not poor).

Even bigger bigger-picture, consider everything you know about the history of race relations (and policing) in America, add it to the above, and apply some everyday logic.

I mean honestly. The number of people in this thread working double overtime to avoid the simplest hypothesis is baffling. Maybe it's poverty! Maybe black people are just unusually terrible drivers and somehow no one's ever noticed! Maybe it's, um, something else! Sure. Okay. But also: *Maybe it's racism. Again.* It's hardly implausible. Wouldn't be the first time."
