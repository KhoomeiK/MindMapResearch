ShitMomGroupsSay,ff6lnaq,t3_erxpxy,1579629836.0,"Apart from all the stupid in this post, I appreciate how she admits her mom gave all her other siblings a detox bath but not her.  Guess she wasn't the favorite?"
FundieSnark,ff6cu0i,t1_ff6bcmf,1579624409.0,"As I said, I was on Theraflu when I made my initial comment and yes, it isn't a crapload of privilege for me to eat this way but there is quite a bit of it.  And for Lori to be able to do ear she does requires a huge amount of privilege.  I was acknowledging my position in this before criticizing her.  

It isn't just poor people who deal with this, I used to work as a bakery manager and I was up at 2 am to get to work where I often worked 12-14 hours a day and 6-7 days a week.  I got overtime and had a lot of money but zero time or energy to meal prep, often forgot to bring the food I had and made other choices.  I don't have kids but if I was a fundie woman with a gaggle of kids and an unsupportive husband who never lifted a finger, I wouldn't have time or energy to care as much about our food, either.  

I fully agree with you that the processed meats and other low quality processed foods are killing us but for Lori to act like all people can just easily make these choices just shows how out if touch she is."
FundieSnark,ff6akek,t1_ff618o0,1579622966.0,"I totally get what you're saying.  I know you can eat vegan very cheaply.  I was high on Theraflu last night and didn't clarify.  I am mainly vegan but on rare occasions I do eat fish or a really good piece of cheese.  I don't eat that way for ethical reasons even though there are many of those, I keep doing it for health and because it makes me feel the best.  The fact is that I have time to shop and consider what I'm going to eat and meal prep, I have a plethora of fresh foods to choose from so I don't get bored, I have a great support system of friends who support my choices and are good role models, when I want a piece of fish I can afford to pay $18 a pound for it (even though that pisses me off).  It isn't just the food itself, it's the quality and variety that make it a privilege.  

 We also have the autonomy to choose what we eat and try other things- I doubt all the women that Lori preaches to has any autonomy over their daily choices including food."
booksuggestions,ff5h0q9,t1_ff5bpur,1579592486.0,"Best book ever.  I love sharing it with my friends' kids and I'm so happy that decades after I was obsessed with it, kids still are!  They want it read to them over and over.  I hope whoever wrote it is getting royalties."
FundieSnark,ff5gmwb,t3_erpx8u,1579592006.0,"That's a whole lot of frickin privilege this woman is showing.  Her food sounds delicious and I try to eat a load of fresh veggies every day, too but I fully recognize that my ability to eat a mainly vegan diet requires a crapload of privilege and I'd never shame people for not eating this way.  But never drinking tap water so always buying bottled water?  Buying fluoride free toothpaste? All organic and non-toxic beauty care?  Dude.  That shit is expensive.  

Clearly she has that kind of money but many people simply don't and why try to shame those people who can't by implying that they'll get cancer from fucking tap water???"
FundieSnark,ff5g8jm,t3_ernf5n,1579591515.0,I dunno.  In all of my adult relationships I was always more relieved when an argument was over because usually we had learned more about each other or learned how to listen better or communicate in a way that we both needed.  The loving part was a given.  It was to figure out how to avoid those arguments in the first place because we became more sensitive to each other's needs and often to our own.  I feel like these kids just lack all emotional maturity and think that fighting is just how you deal with all issues.

FundieSnark,ff4zbzo,t3_erlf0s,1579576094.0,"I hope she drives to the library and starts reading. Just anything outside of her narrow worldview.  It doesn't need to be Hitch or any anti-religion person, just some nice fiction where women have lives beyond being mothers and helpmeets.  Ones where they make choices, eat a full meal, go to college or a trade school, decide eventually if they want to get married and have a kid."
suggestmeabook,ff4yiv3,t3_erj3y4,1579575523.0,"America's Test Kitchen is great and their Cooks Illustrated magazine explains why you're doing the things you're doing and what they tried that didn't work.  

For a book though, Salt Fat Acid Heat is fantastic.  It is accessible for a beginner, has basic recipes to illustrate her wisdom, and is enjoyable to read and then apply your new knowledge."

But I walk to work and live in a walkable neighborhood so I am 5 blocks from a pharmacy and grocery store and my gym and restaurants and bars.  It's great!  Yes, if I lived further away and outside of town I could have a larger place but I'd commute at least an hour each way and I'd need a car.  I save loads of money because I don't buy stuff since my place is small and I can bus or Uber anywhere else I need to be.  It's great living the non-commuting life!! Your time is yours."

When you're in your 20s that may not be as important but by the time you're in your mid-30s, I think most of us were like ""crap, I really have to start being serious about retirement one day!""

fatlogic,feyty31,t1_feylycv,1579450473.0,That's my favorite part of the show.  Everyone seems willing to accept the truth once they are shown their eating habits.  I don't remember anyone trying to make excuses or claiming that those weren't typical days for them.  Maybe it's because everyone on there wants to lose weight and I simply haven't seen an episode with a radical FA who wants to argue?  I'm sure it'll happen eventually.

Sure I pay more in rent but I have a 10 min walk to work, save money not having a car and it is blissful.  Had I moved to a cheaper place I would've had at least an hour commute.  I also moved into a studio which works well since it's just me, I don't have loads of stuff, and not having room to put new stuff makes it impossible for me to buy things when I'm bored so I save even more money.

And for Lori to be able to do ear she does requires a huge amount of privilege.  I was acknowledging my position in this before criticizing her.  

It isn't just poor people who deal with this, I used to work as a bakery manager and I was up at 2 am to get to work where I often worked 12-14 hours a day and 6-7 days a week.  I got overtime and had a lot of money but zero time or energy to meal prep, often forgot to bring the food I had and made other choices.  I don't have kids but if I was a fundie woman with a gaggle of kids and an unsupportive husband who never lifted a finger, I wouldn't have time or energy to care as much about our food, either.  

I fully agree with you that the processed meats and other low quality processed foods are killing us but for Lori to act like all people can just easily make these choices just shows how out if touch she is."

I am mainly vegan but on rare occasions I do eat fish or a really good piece of cheese.  I don't eat that way for ethical reasons even though there are many of those, I keep doing it for health and because it makes me feel the best.  The fact is that I have time to shop and consider what I'm going to eat and meal prep, I have a plethora of fresh foods to choose from so I don't get bored, I have a great support system of friends who support my choices and are good role models, when I want a piece of fish I can afford to pay $18 a pound for it (even though that pisses me off).  It isn't just the food itself, it's the quality and variety that make it a privilege.

My doctor is happy that it is controlled with meds but I want to be off Ramipril completely.  I'll keep working, I still have a bit more to lose and maybe eventually I can lower how much I take.  But my dad had HBP most of his life despite never being overweight and always being active so I'm just dreading finding out that this is possibly also my fate."
keto,fdcyrok,t3_ekm7i4,1578288341.0,"The great thing about water is that it is practically free, easily found, has no calories or artificial sweeteners, it helps you feel full, helps with all of your digestive functions as well as other body benefits.  I don't know why people try to downplay how much water we should drink.  Yes, there are no scientific studies that uphold the 8x8 rule for water but there is plenty of anecdotal evidence to support the idea that water makes us feel great.  Almost everyone can benefit from drinking a bit more so why not just try it out?"
personalfinance,fdcn97c,t1_fdcn4bt,1578279127.0,Parents are funny that way.  I pay $1245 a month which seems like a lot but I live in Seattle where rent is crazy high.  I kinda lucked out.
aww,fdcmyc0,t3_ekm5q0,1578278911.0,"When I first moved out, my mom would drop random care packages of things like toilet paper, peanut butter, rice, etc.  She'd always say that she found a ""2 for 1"" deal or had coupons and didn't need everything.  Weirdly, no one else ever found those deals that my mom did.  :-)"
personalfinance,fdcmpa6,t1_fdcjn3c,1578278731.0,"I do this and love it.  I moved a few blocks from my work which is a pricey neighborhood but since I can walk to the grocery store, my gym, work, and there's good mass transit, I don't need a car.  Sure I pay more in rent but I have a 10 min walk to work, save money not having a car and it is blissful.  Had I moved to a cheaper place I would've had at least an hour commute.  I also moved into a studio which works well since it's just me, I don't have loads of stuff, and not having room to put new stuff makes it impossible for me to buy things when I'm bored so I save even more money.  Good luck!"

Youniqueamua,fdc5a0s,t3_ekivqk,1578267372.0,"She has lovely skin and pretty eyes, why is she ruining them with this awfulness?"
Youniqueamua,fdc4c16,t3_ekei0k,1578266853.0,She sounds like Cartman: I do what I want!
FundieSnark,fdbyfrs,t1_fdatfc0,1578263832.0,I remember Lane from Gilmore Girls telling others about her crazy restrictive rules at her college and laughing at the absurdity of it.  Apparently they weren't exaggerating too much and that is so sad
