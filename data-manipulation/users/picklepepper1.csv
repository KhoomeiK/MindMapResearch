college,ff61ix2,t1_ff5qnpw,1579616754.0,What an ignorant thing to say
college,ff490uf,t1_ff1jzbm,1579558176.0,That's what my mom always says to get me through. I feel like my high school friends will be the closest friends I make
college,ff48w0q,t3_erfqro,1579558092.0,Yea....it's the worst. This is my 4th semester and it never gets easier. It's hard when you go from highschool being very social and having lots of friends to having no one in college.
smallbusiness,ff1untz,t1_ff1ulcu,1579486578.0,Ohhh yes sorry for understanding! That’s what I was planning to do. Probably just smack a small sticker on the front
smallbusiness,ff1tiy5,t1_ff1tei5,1579485842.0,"Yes, I could, but I think I want to start off with something smaller. Plus it’s easier to get to my office if I ride through campus as opposed to driving around. Plus I’d love an eco-friendly ride!"
smallbusiness,ff1hvjm,t1_ff1ht85,1579479477.0,Yes! It’s the GOTRAX GXL V2

smallbusiness,ff0i4th,t1_ff0hxw2,1579469106.0,Thank you!
smallbusiness,ff0ay04,t1_ff08hmh,1579467011.0,I didn’t say I barely had enough money? Where was that stated?
smallbusiness,ff0a6a6,t3_er1hzr,1579466833.0,That’s a great idea! My business is Ecofriendly too. I could use it as marketing as well to show off eco-friendly ways to commute!
smallbusiness,ff04qq0,t1_ff04lug,1579465220.0,That’s the route I think I’ll take. Thank you very much!
smallbusiness,ff043at,t1_ff03m4w,1579464969.0,Would it be illegal to buy it using money from the business? Or would I buy it with my own?
college,feyq50m,t1_feypu0f,1579449163.0,"I’m at ECU on scholarship and it has been the best decision I made... if you’re looking for medical, but not sure, I highly recommend coming down for a tour or something and talking with someone. I’d also be happy to give you a tour as well! Acceptance rate is pretty high, but so is the quality of professors/class. There was actually a girl in one of my classes last semester that had cancer from sophomore-senior year of high school and I didn’t take a traditional path to finish, but she was still welcomed into the honors college. 

The nursing school/med school here is amazing! 

If you’re looking for something more chill, my twin brother goes to App and he looooooves loves loves it. 

UNC schools are the best are you should really reach out to people at those schools and explain your situation to see if they can help you! 

Good luck :)"

AmItheAsshole,few21yb,t1_few1qgt,1579404392.0,"Why would she deserve to be comfortable when she makes my life a living hell every day? I couldn't even really begin to explain what she puts me through because of the 3000 character limit. When I start avoiding the room for 12+ hours on most days, I believe she does not deserve comfort because that's not what I had. There is no need for her to pay if she cannot."
AmItheAsshole,few0oz5,t1_few0jsd,1579403807.0,She doesn't have to pay the fee unless she wants the luxury of having a double room to herself.
AmItheAsshole,fevzcks,t1_fevz2ow,1579403383.0,"This is my main reason as to why I would tell her... but also she does have until May to pay, so I don't know."

Random_Acts_Of_Pizza,fe3cnwu,t3_ennuiv,1578848078.0,I just got back to college after break...I'm extremely homesick and have been sitting in my room all day. I tried to go on a walk but it started pouring. A pizza would make my day so much better in ways you would never know!
