Gin,ffwefa9,t3_euv2mr,1580297828.0,"A lot of people who don't like the traditional London Dry Gin profile are fans of **Hendricks**. It's the most popular alternative these days, and I know a number of people for whom it's their go-to when drinking out.

Probably even more approachable is **Bloom**, a more gentle and floral Gin. This is the one I'd suggest you try, as Bloom has a following among out-and-out gin haters. It's still a valid, bold London Dry Gin, and can be mixed as such.

Although it hasn't been widely available, **Tanqueray Malacca** is worth a try. It's both toned down and slightly sweeter than the standard gin, leaning toward an Old Tom variety, which makes it an ideal candidate for old classic (especially pre-prohibition) recipes. Reviewers suggest Tanqueray Malacca could work for people who don't like the dry, juniper-forward flavor profile of common gins. Flavor is citrus-forward with cooking spice in the middle and a creamy finish.

.

I second the nomination of Aviation Gin as an alternative profile, but it is a bit more alcohol-y, retains some juniper (albeit muted), and comes off harsh on the opening, after which it quickly mellows."
gadgets,ffwdece,t3_evjn4h,1580296534.0,"About 15-20 years ago, iRiver offered hard drive mo3 players with high capacity, and they were working on gapless play. You might research their players, but the main issue is in the encoding of the music tracks. Their common work-around was to offer adjustable corssfade from one track to the next.

A firmware hack, Rockbox, was created that applied to a number of players from various companies. I believe they were working on gapless as well, but I don't know whether they achieved it.

In general, you can solve the issue with your encoding, by ripping a whole album as one file rather than separating it into tracks. Exact Audio Copy and players like Mediamonkey are able to rip from CD in this way; and of course a number of desktop players offer gapless playback.

These days, streaming services have largely supplanted mp3 players."

But the Axtec, for whom Nahuatl was the *lingua franca*, inhabited the area from 1300 to 1521. The Buddhist visitors predated them by many centuries, thought to have established contact, if not a colony, by 458. So in terms of timeline, the Nahuatl etymology (if authentic itself, which you haven't shown) could have originated from an already established Buddhist name.

I have no idea whether the name claim is accurate, but it's part of an interesting and little-known area of historical research.

It is now widely recognized that Pyrrho, the first Skeptic philosopher and originator of Pyrrhonism, developed his philosophy through direct contact and study with Buddhist teachers during his travels in India with Alexander The Great.

See *Greek Buddha: Pyrrho's Encounter With Early Buddhism In Central Asia*. | https://thebuddhistcentre.com/westernbuddhistreview/pyrrho-and-buddha-reasons-be-sceptical 

>""When Pyrrho returned to Greece he founded a philosophy based on his interpretation of the Buddhist *Three Marks of Existence* filtered through his prior adherence to Democritean philosophy.

>""How the second historical exchange happened is difficult to trace, but the evidence that it happened is strong. We have several books from the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus, written around 200 CE. These books appear to be mostly compilations of existing Pyrrhonist arguments against the dogmas of the other Hellenistic schools of philosophy. Writing around the same time as Sextus Empiricus was the Buddhist philosopher, Nagarjuna, whose works contain a couple hundred of the same arguments that Sextus Empiricus recorded. Unlike the situation in Greek philosophy, in the context of Indian philosophy nearly all of these arguments appear to have been novel. It seems exceedingly unlikely that Nargarjuna could have come up with all of these arguments himself, and in fact Nargarjuna attests that he did not. He said that they came from 'hidden' books.
From this it would appear that Nagarguna obtained access to some Pyrrhonist books that had been imported into India as part of the flourishing trade between India and the Roman Empire. Other Greek books were known to have made it to India. Hence, Pyrrhonism is a major source for Buddhist Madhyamika philosophy.""

There is even a growing case that not only the were Pythagoreans, led by Parmenides, founded on transmissions from a Buddhist or pre-Buddhist shaman from Central Asia (Hyperborea), but that in fact the seed of western civilization itself may have been planted by this 'Daka' (literally, 'Sky-Walker' -- an evolved being), named Abaris.

Chilling reverberations, given the context of this thread.

A lot of people default to ""erasing"" rather than the more mature and more difficult alternative of communicating and rallying transformative compassion.

You could call this willingness to *wave the hand and erase the other* your Inner Hitler.

In psychological terms, with this attitude of avoidance you create the shadow which then controls you from the unconscious corners of your psyche.

How we face (or don't face) the 'difficult other', be they the supposedly problematic Jew in 1938 Germany or the problematic budding Neo-Nazi in 2020 America, shapes our personal shadow; and what we are willing or unwilling to face together shapes our societal shadow."
