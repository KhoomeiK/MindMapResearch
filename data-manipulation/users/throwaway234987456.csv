If people adopted more, that demand would disappear and the businesses would stop producing supply because it would no longer be profitable or worth their while. So, by shopping and not adopting, you are directly supporting and therefore perpetuating the businesses that produce puppies for profit. And even if you buy from a reputable breeder, you are still contributing to the overall demand in that industry, which in turn leads to less ethical people (puppy mills) seeing the potential for profit and continues the cycle of animals being abused and more sick puppies being brought into the world."
aww,fcscwm4,t1_fcs5jva,1577914778.0,"If everyone adopted, puppy mills would go out of business because the market for purebred puppies wouldn’t exist. Dogs would overall be healthier because most conditions that run within purebred ‘breeds’ (ones that are screened for by breeders) are the result of the extremely limited gene pool and selective breeding/inbreeding that gave rise to specific breeds in the first place."

AskReddit,fcm8d93,t1_fclkyzm,1577766952.0,I have a friend named Isis. It wasn’t really a huge problem until we started losing her at crowded parties and bars. Apparently yelling “ISIS” loudly while standing up on your chair is a little alarming for the people around you.
dating_advice,fcm4idz,t1_fcm0ko6,1577764030.0,"I guess what I meant is that I don’t think much of it because I’d act that way with anyone, but they assume I am open because I must really like and trust them. It’s not the positive response back that makes me pull away, it’s them getting really attached when I feel like I’m just getting to know them. I have met people that I haven’t ghosted because I had the opportunity to see who they were as a person, and not just who they present themselves to be on dates. Also, if I don’t feel like I know them, I also feel like they don’t know me that well either.

An example, when I was in high school I was talking to a guy who worked in a different department of the same store as me. We had talked for a couple weeks, and one day we were both working he said he would pop by to chat on his break. He realized later that day that he actually wasn’t working but decided to walk almost an hour to work anyway just to see me. Although it was very kind and I was flattered, I knew that I wouldn’t have done the same for him. I hardly knew anything about him. He was in a lot deeper than I was and I just felt guilty for not being able to reciprocate so I cut things off. People should be able to find someone who can give back what they give in a relationship."
dating_advice,fclpuu5,t3_ehqb5k,1577753562.0,"As a girl who has (regrettably) ghosted a few guys, I’ll add my input as I’m sure this happens the other way as well. It takes me a while to warm up to someone and figure out if I actually like them, but that’s not apparent as I tend to be friendly and talkative. Sometimes people mistake my honesty and friendliness as interest or trust, but I likely haven’t figured out how I feel. When people begin to show that they are getting emotionally invested or that they really like me, I get really intimidated and feel like i’m on a time crunch. For example, if they say they miss me or they wish they could see me, or if they do/say something particularly thoughtful, I feel really guilty because I know I would not feel that way or do that for them. If they are emotionally invested now, they’ll only become more invested over time. Either way I’ll hurt them, but if I break things off later I’ll only hurt them more then if break things off right away. But, because I’m a wimp when it comes to confrontation, most of the time I just pull away slowly and eventually disappear rather than having to straight up tell them I care about them a lot less than they care about me. It’s shitty and immature and I am hoping that next time I’ll be brave enough to vocalize how I feel in a way that isn’t hurtful, but my only consolation is that I am not leading them on and saving them more harm longterm."
AskReddit,fclhosa,t3_ehn3ua,1577748039.0,"Gluten free versions of regular foods are generally less healthy than their gluten-containing counterparts. Gluten itself is not harmful unless you have an allergy or sensitivity. In order to make them taste better (less like sand, more like bread) a lot of breads, pastries and other gluten-free versions of foods have more sugar and fats than regular bread and baked goods would."

ADHD,fc40wty,t3_efx1wb,1577403720.0,"I was in my first year of undergrad. Had always been someone to do things at the last minute, but I chalked that up to not being challenged enough in my high school classes and being able to get away with it while still getting good grades. My mom did a lot for me when it came to keeping my life organized and that helped a lot. I was always one to have a million things on the go so it was understandable that I couldn’t keep up, “even a normal person would be overwhelmed”. The two things that solidified it for me was A) being away from my mom/life organizer and B) actually being around other people when I worked/studied and noticing that they were world’s different from me. I also lost things constantly, and my university friends thought it was so funny and always made jokes about it so I knew it was abnormal. I brought it up to my parents but they dismissed it as I had been a relatively quiet kid and always really good grades, and so I also dismissed it. It wasn’t until I came home during exams and they watched me trying to study that they actually thought it was worth checking out. It upsets me now to know that I may have been able to avoid some really rough depressive/anxious times in my life if I had known sooner. I am just glad to know now. I feel a lot less like a piece of shit person for my habits and more like someone who is trying their best, which has been huge for my self esteem. I hope this helps"
