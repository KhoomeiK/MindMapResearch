politics,ffi7dlu,t1_ffi3rp4,1579967024.0,Trump allows them to more brazenly go about their business.  Facts mean less than they ever have under Trump's presidency.  That's an extremely valuable asset.  No other Republican politician has the rabid base that Trump has.  That's also part of the reason they are protecting him so hard.
politics,ffhxhxs,t1_ffhw7yp,1579958202.0,Rich people like Trump's tax cut handout to the 1%.  Protecting trump protects their tax cuts which in turn will allows rich people to donate to Republican PACs.  It's not rocket science.  Everything these politicians do and say is to position themselves to receive money from the donor class.  Start looking at everything from the lens of money and the world starts making a hell of a lot more sense.
SandersForPresident,ffhvw52,t1_ffhswcq,1579956299.0,I've been predicting Warren made a deal with Biden to be a progressive spoiler.  She's not going to drop out in exchange for a place in bidens administration.  That attack on Bernie was too obvious.  She's no longer on Bernie's side of the aisle.  She wants to siphon as much of the vote away from him as possible.
politics,ffho1sn,t1_ffh7esl,1579944736.0,"So you're saying, because YOU think it can't happen, WE shouldn't fight for it despite the fact you acknowledge it's a good idea?  You're weak, defeatist attitude is extremely depressing.  It's the same attitude that allows terrible things to happen around the world.  Tens of millions of people in this country can't afford health insurance. 
 Hundreds of thousands of people are literally getting sick and some dying EVERY YEAR from lack of healthcare in this country and you would rather back a plan that cuts the number in half (and barely address the cost) instead of a plan that would completely eliminate it ""because it's more realistic"".  Get the hell out of here, it's totally possible, you just don't WANT to fight for it.  Nothing would ever change in this country if everyone was like you.  The only way to beat the corruption is to fight it.

Also, it's not a ""tax increase"" for the vast majority of Americans.  You're spouting neoliberal bullshit talking points about medicare for all.  This system will save the the vast majority of Americans thousands and thousands of dollars per year by REMOVING the disgusting rapacious middleman of the healthcare insurance industry and give the governement the power to negotiate prices down, LIKE NEARLY EVERY OTHER 1ST WORLD COUNTRY.  This is not a crazy idea like you're suggesting.  We spend twice as much per capita for healthcare for a system where 10's of millions of those capitas dont have coverage.  We also have worse healthcare outcomes than the rest of the world.  It's a system where we have worse care and less coverage for nearly double the amount of money and your ""realistic"" solution is to basically throw a bandaid on it.

Here's a Koch brothers REPUBLICAN funded study showing how much money M4A would save Americans.  In the worst case scenario, we would save 2 trillion dollars over 10 years.  The non-biased studies say we would save even more than this.  Only centrists like yourself could spin that kind of savings into ""tax increase"".  It's ethically and financially irresponsible to not be for M4A with these numbers.

Bernie has been fighting for this M4A agenda in some form his whole life.  He's never backed down on it.  He's never changed his mind like other candidates.  He always has fought for it.  If anyone is capable of making it happen, it's him.  And you sit here, admitting M4A sounds like a nice idea, but you REFUSE to fight for it.  It must not sound that nice to you then.

If you go in fighting for M4A, you compromise down to the public option.  It's basic negotiation.  Stand for your ideals now and compromise IF you have to.  What does it say about Warren when she's already compromising her positions.  It tells me she's not a great fighter for the working people.  She's already listening to corporate interests.

In a libertarian vacuum, Yang's UBI is a progressive system.  It isn't progressive in our current system because it actively punishes people for being poor already. People not receiving government benefits get $1000 every month (which is fine) but the poor person on government benefits gets less or nothing (not fine)."

You can see that in 2008 (the only line you can follow besides 1996), young voter turnout was actually higher than average and old turnout a bit lower than other years.  Obama won that year and he ran a pretty far left campaign.  That's the kind of campaign Bernie is running (except he's not a neoliberal sellout).  It's reliant on getting those few extra percentage points from young turnout.  I still think it's a feasible strategy that could work.

People are angrier now than in 2008.  Negative partishanship drives turnout and that's never been higher for Democrats.  Experts have been predicting young voter turnout will be higher than 2008.  It may not be enough, but it's a legitimate electoral theory they're attempting to follow.

edit:  You can also see that in years when Republicans gained seats, youth turnout was lower than other years.  It's all about getting young people out.  You don't need giant swings in turnout demographics.  No one is expecting Millennials to overtake Boomers in overall turnout (which is why the overall historical turnout graphs are useless).  That's not what Bernie is trying to do.  The turnout statistics just need to be nudged slightly to get young voters out.  Every year that passes, that gets easier and easier."

Of course the turnout is lower on average for young people if you average all the elections together.  Of course it's going to follow a pattern like that.  We all know that already.

It's all about increasing young voter turnout in INDIVIDUAL elections.  Increasing young turnout by even 5-10% would have a huge impact on the results of elections."
