Teachers,ffdqb29,t3_et0eop,1579826384.0,"Why would using the regular or student restroom be inappropriate? 

There are four minutes between classes. There are five teachers that need to use the restroom and there is one (two if your lucky) staff restrooms in your hallway. Given the time restraint,  you use the regular restroom.     Sure using the staff method is preferable, but when you have to go, you use the option available to you.  The advantage of the staff restroom is that it is more private and often cleaner.  It is a perk of being a teacher, not a requirement of being employed at the school."

I could get a contact eye exam for $80-$100 USD.  I can buy glasses for $100-$150 USD.  I don't get new glasses every year and my vision insurance pays for my contacts, but I believe they are between $200-$300 USD.  I wear dailies so that is more expensive. 

Vision is too horribly over the top expensive and there are many programs that can get school age kids glasses if they need them."

Teachers,fevuswy,t3_eqjyxo,1579401790.0,"It makes sense to me.  If you are taking a day off of work you need to take a days equivalent of sick time.  After all, if you go into work on a two hour delay you are getting paid for a full day.  The point of the delay is to keep you safe as you commute to work, not give you two hours off.  

We had fig so dense you couldn't see traffic lights this week.  I had a delay.  My husband who is not in education did not.   His choices were to drive 3the fog or take PTO until he felt safe enough to drive to work.   I am going to  choose be thankful that I got an additional 2 hours before I had to leave and keep a full day's pay than complain that I have to take a full day off."

Teachers,feoxuwj,t3_eq6q5y,1579307748.0,"I understand that you say you are only talking to some middle and high school students, but you come across very condescending. 

I think you need to keep in mind that middle and high school teachers are dealing with students who are still figuring out empathy, but have already figured out how to press all of the right buttons.   

I have students who think I am the world's worst teacher because I won't help them until they have tried to answer the question, read me a passage from their notes or the book.  I have students who think I am disrespecting them because they are asked to remove their hood, put their phones away,  etc. the first time and then told to do so after that.  

I have students who thank me for giving them extra help or spending time with them because they were struggling and I took the time to help.  I have students who think I am a great teacher because we do things more than one way.  

You may be talking to the student that I had to tell 15 times in a 46 minute class period to remove their hood.  I guarantee it doesn't sound so nice after the second time.  You may be talking to the student who has suddenly decided that to fit in they need to be rude to the teacher which is something you didn't experience. 

Yes, middle and high school kids need TLC.  They need tough love sometimes too."
Teachers,felj1hj,t3_epr62e,1579223355.0,"I only assign homework for AP classes.  Very rarely do I assign homework otherwise. Usually they can finish in class and if they don't it's homework. In other words, they give themselves the homework. 

They are going to moan and groan no matter what.  They will attempt to make you think you are giving too much work and they need more time.  Ince it has been established (this can take a couple of years) that you expect students to finish assignments in a reasonable time, they will do as asked.  Of course,  they are teenagers so some will always complain. Stick to your guns."

Teachers,fdsiuhj,t1_fdrfoof,1578703584.0,I disagree.  Technology allows me to do things in the classroom I would not have been able to do before.  There many sensors and probes that interface with computers that allow for data collection and analysis.   Virtual labs assist in familiarizing students with a process so there is less waste when it comes to the actual labs.  Training students using the technology used in a specific field allows for faster certification of students if they are not receiving that certification in high school CTE programs.
Teachers,fdp5jo6,t1_fdp50fo,1578620498.0,"I have never taught where there was not a sub shortage.

Lastly, I wish I had subs that are as dedicated as you! I have had good subs, bad subs, and average subs.  I am usually okay as long as the tower of cards that holds up the sub day isn't on fire.  I am always happy when I have a sub who makes an amazing effort and works to interact with the students."
Teachers,fdp29hd,t1_fdoek44,1578618281.0,"I complain about subs who:

A) don't even attempt to follow the sub plan.  I once had a sub who left me a note on a piece of paper saying he couldn't find the rosters or the sub plans.  He put the note on the binder labeled sub plans. 

B) show up 30 minutes late causing the students I am taking to a competition be late or me to be late to whatever I am leaving for.

C) don't show up.  

My expectations for the sub are to follow the plans I have left to the best of their ability and let me know what they did or did not get to that day.  I leave a note with basic classroom expectations but tell them that they are in charge.  I also leave a note on the board and post in Google classroom that they must follow the rules of the sub."

While I enjoy my time off (what teacher doesn't?), I spend vast amounts of time working when school is not in session.   This is the first year I haven't worked on an extended contract actually.   However that is neither here nor there.  I work my days as contracted.  Anything else is purely voluntary. 

I agree OP should find a career that better suits her needs, but I also understand how it feels to ask for advice and respond without much help.  

I understand stand that you feel like you are being brutally honest by just saying you should not be a teacher or DON'T BE A TEACHER, but when you are responding to someone who is looking at changing careers and mentions mental health and anxiety,  you could respond differently, possibly more gently, and get the same point across.   For example: It sounds like you are making the correct decision to no longer be a classroom teacher based on your post.  Have you thought of XYZ instead?"
Teachers,fd5syp4,t1_fd5qotf,1578181151.0,"I understand that there are  differences between OP and I, but I also understand that I don't need to yell, ""don't be a teacher"" at someone who is looking to change careers away from teaching. OP mentioned her anxiety, lesson planning, observations, and extras in her post.  It seems the only thing you locked on  to was that she liked the schedule and you thought OP said lessons and observations were extras.  

Also, I have worked in districts where teachers get dinged for being off script in their lesson.   If the script that they wrote differed from what they said or were doing they get dinged on planning and prep. I know of districts where extremely detailed lesson plans have to be turned in three weeks in advance.   All teachers should be at the exact same point on the exact day.  I feel none of these are beneficial to students."
Teachers,fd5pzr6,t1_fd5mwdy,1578180163.0,"I also don't like observations and formal lesson plans.  I do understand that they are a part of the job though.  I absolutely abhor grading,  but I do it anyway,  because it is part of the job.  
Observations are hard for me because I have a hard time not acknowledging people in my room and I have always been told to act as if they were not there.  It also increases my anxiety exponentially. 
To me formal or scripted lessons are a waste if my time.  I don't want to spend six hours saying the same thing.  Chances are each of those classes have different personalities.  My ideal lesson plans include the standard,  the objective,  and the name of the teaching strategies.   I enjoy preparing the activities as opposed to explaining the activities. 
None of this means I shouldn't be a teacher.   I enjoy working with students and sharing knowledge.  I love that moment when a student volunteers to explain something to the rest of the class.  I love watching them grow."
