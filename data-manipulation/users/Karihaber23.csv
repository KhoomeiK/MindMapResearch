aww,ffftenv,t3_etavx9,1579891398.0,The amount of intent those dogs are watching the kittens with is so precious. It's like a mixture or curiosity and protection.
UnresolvedMysteries,ff5afe4,t3_erg75b,1579585168.0,"It's so sad. Such a scary way to go (and one of my fears). My mom's cousin and his family (wife, two kids, and dog) were all killed when their vehicle submerged into water. They were found only a few hours later so they were never missing, but it's still devastating."
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,feo9lnj,t1_fejv4wl,1579297008.0,Thank you!
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,feiuec6,t1_fehtis9,1579147479.0,Thanks! I hope so too. May sound fun to just sleep all day but it's not.
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,feiuc9l,t1_feht1m4,1579147434.0,It is! Hopefully the doctor can figure something out so I'm not sleeping all day anymore.
