A blonde was desperate for money. So she decided to go to the richer neighbourhoods around town and look for odd jobs.

At the first house, a man answered the door and told her. ‘Yeah, I have a job for you. Could you paint the porch?’

‘Sure,’ smiled the blonde, ‘I’ll do it for $100.’

‘Great,’ the man replied. ‘You’ll find the paint and stuff you need in the garage.’

The man went back into the house to his wife, who’d been listening. ‘A hundred bucks! Does she know it goes all the way around the house?’ asked the wife.

‘Well, she must. She was standing right on it!’ he said.

About 45 minutes later, the blonde knocked on the door. ‘I’m all done,’ she reported.

The man was amazed. You painted the whole porch?’

‘Yeah,’ the blonde said. ‘I even had some left, so I put on two coats!’

The man reached into his wallet to pay her.

‘And by the way,’ said the blonde, ‘that’s not a Porsche. It’s a Ferrari.’"
