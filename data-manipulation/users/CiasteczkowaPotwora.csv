Also, drink plenty of water and do breathing exercises alone, after any such events. This has a calming effect on your body."

vaginismus,fe1dco2,t3_eniu55,1578825241.0,"Hi there. Sorry to hear your story.

Yes, anxiety is probably stressing and tensing you further thus tightening your muscles even more. Relaxing, meditating, breathing exercises is a must here. I am using some mindfulness meditation videos from youtube.

I did go to the therapist to manage the psychical roots of vaginismus. I understood that the barrier was just the massive fear in my head and I had to overcome it. You might find a visit with sexologist helpful.

But at least in my case, visiting doctors, gynecologist and physiotherapist, and using dialators helped most. 

Hope you get better soon."

I experience severe pain in my clit when stimulated. I never had an orgasm because of it. 

My doctor says that those two things are connected and it is quite common actually. The association of any pleasure with pain means that you tense everywhere and she said that I will not loosen up and will not get clitoral orgasm until u get vaginismus under control. :("
