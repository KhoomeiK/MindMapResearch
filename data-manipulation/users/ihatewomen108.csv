RBI,ff82a4b,t3_es07nm,1579664104.0,"If it’s someone with the intent to cause harm, you can tell that they’re most likely doing this for attention . By declaring their motive, they’re putting out what they’re going to do, and trying to cause a scare factor. If they were truly and only sent on hurting you, they wouldn’t need to send a letter. Based on how well they tried to conceal their handwriting they probably wouldn’t be as confident in person or when they were attempting to break in- however, it’s obvious they want a reaction. The letter isn’t necessary to commit a crime, and neither is the drawing. I’d assume this is an antisocial type loner due to the publicity of the threats, most likely a white male aged 27-30. Good luck"
