worldnews,ffxg8bx,t1_ffxfgxs,1580324520.0,"They couldn't nuke whoever they wanted. Hell, even a single nuke would legitimately put the entire world in danger. When a nuke is in the air it's not always possible to know where it's headed, all it takes is for India or Pakistan to freak out and you've got global nuclear apocalypse. After the first salvo it's all MAD - automated systems in place to guarantee that nobody with anything more sophisticated than a toaster is left alive. The whole point of nukes is that you don't need to worry about being nuked when you have them. They aren't meant to be used. China could nuke anybody but they'd be tossing a coin on whether they survived the next 45 minutes."

worldnews,ffwja17,t1_ffvwh7p,1580302837.0,"It depends on the scale. If it was an actual ""super"" supercomputer then you might need that amount of cooling. Keep in mind that rock sucks as a heat sink, and unless your pipes are physically touching the rock virtually no heat will be transferred to them. Without a medium heat barely moves at all. Over time the rocks around the pipe would subtly reshape because of the heat causing contractions and expansions, enough to cause a tenth of a millimetre gap. When that happens you want redundancy which would probably look like massively excessive pipe networks. 

The other two problems tie into one another. Even if you can install the solar panels perfectly dust will get kicked up by literally anything, including meteors and micrometeors. Whatever you do to avoid it you'll eventually have shitty efficiency. Over a few years you'd be fine but over a few thousand you'd be shit out of luck.

Keep in mind that you can't really have every part of your machine safely buried under metres and metres of concrete. You need a way of transmitting data, or receiving data. You need a way of accessing the site whilst it's being built. You can definitely work to mitigate those problems but that doesn't even factor in the biggest problem of all... No country is insane enough to launch concrete into space. That would turn a multibillion dollar project into a multitrillion dollar project, at least if you're assuming that the entire complex needs to be protected in a way that is viable for thousands of years. One cubic metre of concrete is about 2.5 tonnes. Assuming your entire supercomputer operation, including power generation, is the size of an office building. A 15 storey office building might weigh 30,000 tonnes (estimates vary). A single kilo launched to the moon (not into orbit, which is what most figures reveal) is as much as 17,000 dollars. That's 17,000,000 dollars per metric tonne. That's $510b if you give conservative estimates... Just for the concrete used. That ignores every other cost, that's just launching concrete into space."
worldnews,ffv2pfo,t1_ffv0r8y,1580254301.0,"Solar power on the moon sucks. Moon rocks are like a hyper abrasive, unless you can install them without kicking up any dust at all you'll scratch your panels to hell without even trying. What would be better would be a satellite in lunar orbit with solar panels onboard, using microwave emitters to beam power down to your lunar supercomputer. If you're going hard down the scifi route then you could also generate power with some kind of gravity bleeding tech - the moon is escaping at something like 4cm a year, using awesome future tech you could potentially cancel that escape and generate hugely massive amounts of power, too. The biggest problem with a supercomputer in space is heat dissipation. People think space is cold. It isn't cold, it just isn't warm either. There's nothing for cold or heat to exist in, it's empty. A computer on the moon wouldn't really have anywhere to dump all that heat without some epic hundreds of miles of pipes pushing it deep into the moon where it can't do any harm. You'd also have to worry about micrometeorites since there's nothing shielding the moon - a rock the size of a grain of rice travelling at 30,000+ kph will put a tiny hole right through your expensive computer. Earth, despite its geological instability and social issues might be a better candidate than the moon in real terms."

WatchandLearn,ffp2n9b,t1_ffoxfrt,1580084964.0,"Absolutely, I completely agree. It's more if you wanted to watercool an old, crappy machine as an entertaining personal project. Some crappy copper tubing, an empty coke bottle and some goofy little pumps made out of junk. If your computer has any value at all you should buy real parts but sometimes it's fun to challenge yourself with making silly custom things for the sake of it. As an example I got some thermal paint (like the kind that changes the colour of mugs when you pour boiling water in them) and cut a 20x30cm window in the side of my desktop computer case. I painted some acrylic plastic with the thermal paint so now my computer glows red when it gets warm. Total cost was virtually nothing, I just did it for fun."
mechanical_gifs,ffokqg5,t1_ffnos3k,1580078666.0,"I'd also recommend the YouTube channel ""clickspring"". It's an aussie gentleman that builds a clock entirely from scratch - every screw, every gear, every mechanism all from lumps of metal. It's a fairly long series, probably totally about 3-4 hours... But it's so fucking soothing. He's incredibly talented and soft spoken, and a lot of the video is just high quality shots of him machining metal and then explaining the process. You'll leave the videos realising how little you know about clockwork and that's the first step to actually learning about it, in my opinion."

WatchandLearn,ffnsvzj,t1_ffmtkqt,1580070351.0,"I can think of a few. Obviously buying a proper one would be better, but if you scaled the principle up a little and added a few more chambers and pumps you could make a nifty little compressor for cleaning electronics, a home made airbrush, in a fish tank, or even in a vacuum chamber for removing bubbles from resin. Expanding further with it you could also make a water pump with something like this which could power cooling inside a computer or something similar. It isn't the best solution to most problems but it's simple and it's a fun introduction to the idea. Considering it's probably an hour to build, I wouldn't dismiss it out of hand."
TumblrInAction,ffnq6ez,t1_ffnnzty,1580069257.0,"I literally posted evidence. At what point do you consider that we're both approaching this with a bias, but that perhaps you're wrong? I used to basically believe what you do. It was only when I actually spent a few hours doing my own research that I found that the reality is intuitive - gender dysphoria is a mental health problem but the only negative effects are social in nature, not a direct result of the dysphoria itself. We have no evidence to assert that, in a social vacuum, trans people would attempt suicide at a rate any different to anyone else. We have evidence to prove that increased acceptance helps lower suicide rates. Using evidence based reasoning the logical conclusion is ""we don't have evidence proving a causal link between gender dysphoria and suicide. We do have a causal link between acceptance and suicide. Increasing acceptance is the only evidence based solution"". If you disagree with the logic I'm not sure what to say. If you disagree with the evidence then I implore you to go on your own journey in discovering the truth, or as close to it as we've gotten. You'll reason your opinion out of any evidence I provide, it has to come from your own desire to learn and your willingness to accept new information. I might be able to direct you towards some studies but most of them will seem pretty abstract without context."

Suicide attempts are also much higher amongst every other nonstandard sexual and gender group across all ages - these suicide rates drop at a rate equal to society's acceptance of them. Discrimination and bullying at the fundamental driving force behind most suicide attempts in trans people. Turns out that humans cope very poorly with being shat upon constantly. There is no good science that actually links gender dysphoria with suicide, it isn't like depression. Depression causes suicide. Gender dysphoria *can* cause depression because of social isolation, which then causes suicide. Gender dysphoria doesn't directly cause suicide. Removing the middle step acts to stop suicide as a result of being trans."
TumblrInAction,ffnkmiy,t1_ffnji4s,1580067247.0,"Yes. Because it proves that there is an increased risk of attempted suicide but it disproves the ""42 percent"" myth and also better explains the context of suicide in trans people. It isn't ever ""in most cases"" that trans people are being driven to suicide, reassignment surgery makes a huge difference and denying that requires either a) a willful ignorance of the subject or b) a desire to manipulate the narrative. I don't think you misunderstood any of that originally, I think you didn't read the article. I set out to disprove a statement about the proportion of trans people killing themselves, the article set out to highlight an unfortunate reality facing young people being bullied and shunned into suicide because of their gender identity. The data remains the same, the headline is entirely meaningless."
TumblrInAction,ffnglos,t1_ffmy29n,1580065686.0,"""in most cases driving them to suicide""... That's when I know you're arguing from a position of ignorance. Without looking it up I'd be curious what you think suicide rates are amongst all trans people. Hint: at no point, in any trans community in the western world, are suicide attempts (not even successes) more common than 42 percent. You've probably seen that number before, it's often pushed as the number of trans people that kill themselves. It isn't, at all. It's the number of people that have self reported as attempting it which can include attempts with no actual chance of working. That's in young people, which already have an attempted suicide rate of 18 percent in girls and 10 percent in guys. Trans people aren't more likely to kill themselves than not, that's completely ridiculous.

instantkarma,ff9mb1j,t1_ff9j7la,1579715984.0,"I mean, that's certainly one legal perspective. From what I've heard (specifically about American law) it's always considered murder if somebody dies when you're committing a felony - [felony murder ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony_murder_rule). An extreme example is somebody robbing a shop and an elderly patron having a heart attack. In English law there's something called [Eggshell Skull](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggshell_skull) where the assailant is guilty for the actual consequences rather than the assumed consequences. Not knowing that somebody could die isn't a valid defence when somebody does die.
