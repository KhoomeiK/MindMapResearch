nursing,ffxw5ju,t3_evqlvm,1580333599.0,"There was a rash of that with untrained CNAs when I was a new nurse.  Some of the Haitian CNAs were selling their cards/numbers, for $500 on the black market.  We had so many at one point, who didn't know how to write vitals or read/write/speak English, it was ridiculous.  Then, if/when you called them out on anything, they would cry racism.  It was such a clusterFock."

nursing,ffxv2x8,t3_evreev,1580332998.0,"Death and the dying process, is similar to being born and the birth process.  You have an idea about how it's going to go, but every experience is unique to the person and the family.  It may be shorter, or it may be longer, than you expect.  

There are moments of pain, which we can help alleviate with a medication regimen taylored to their needs.  Most of the time, there are tears and sometimes laughter.  When it's over, you will likely feel a weight lift off your shoulders, although not always.  And in the end, the physical pain abates.

All you have at that point, is memories.  Wonderful memories, of a life that touched you, in so many wonderful ways.  

On a professional note: I get super frustrated, when families think that all we do, is kill their loved ones, by overdosing them on Morphine.  Even after several explanations.  That's not what Hospice is about.  Not even remotely."

nursing,ffx7qx2,t3_evpmcs,1580319510.0,"I've been a nurse for over 20 years, and I couldn't possibly tell you how many times, I have witnessed the same.  Most of my career has been in geriatrics.  It's a losing fight.    

It's family guilt or ignorance sometimes.  Others, it's doctor's, PAs, or NPs, who don't recommend Hospice, because then they lose out on money, which infuriates me.  It's people with a court appointed Guardian, whose hands are tied.  So many factors in place.  It's rarely one thing.  

It's also a legal issue, because too many people don't have Living Wills in place, before they can no longer make choices for themselves.  Sure, they may have a DNR, but because they didn't specify with a LW, we don't always know when to apply it.  When they stop eating?  When they are too confused to know what's happening?  When?  Where is the line?  It's often too complicated to know for sure."
nursing,ffx4p2w,t3_evozqy,1580317690.0,"Spring Hill, Florida would suit your needs.  It has a population of 98k, low crime, about an hour north of Tampa, about 90 minutes west of Orlando.  COL is lower than where you are.  Nice, newer malls, movie theaters, and shopping.  Has several hospital, clinics, even a hyperbaric wound center.  It's not on the water, but not far from it either.  Lots of boating and fishing.  This area has a lot of Manatee sightings, state parks, and you can snorkel for scallops in the summer.  

I live north of there, but in a small town (population 5k), so I know a bunch about the area.  We moved here a couple of years ago, from the crime laden area of SW FL, and I couldn't be happier.  It does get a bit nippy in the winter, but hardly ever cold enough to need more than a sweater and it doesn't last long.  Still get the nice bright sunshine."

TalesFromYourServer,ffwt4af,t3_evjizo,1580310374.0,"It's possible, that it was 40 minutes from the time they sat down.  An approach that may work better is to ask them, if that was the time they sat down.  Apologize and offer to comp something for their wait.  They want to be heard.  

Trying to bring logic into a situation like this, doesn't work on these types of customers.  They just double down on their righteous indignation.  They don't care that you are running around and have a million other things to do.  They don't care that the kitchen is flooded with tickets.  They only care about themselves.  Is better to placate them,  because they will cause a scene, and you could lose more customers, because of the scene they caused.  

This is the way of customer service today.  As long as they don't come in all the time and do this, a small loss, is better than losing customers, in the long term."

I know, not everyone is like me, but you never know who is the one, who will go all in, for patient care. Give them the opportunity to prove they can do it, and are willing to do so.  

Once you determine, who the ""good"" ones are, you know that you can count on them for just about anything.  Those are your team.  

Just make sure you know the limits of their scope, and don't ask them to go beyond that, and they will do just about anything for you, and the patient.  We all work as a team, to make sure the patient's needs are met.  That's my philosophy anyway."

CasualConversation,ffvhrjc,t3_ev8xbe,1580264408.0,"After waiting over two weeks for the pathology to come back, I learned that my biopsies, were mostly benign.  The large polyp was beginning to turn into potential cancer, and if we had not caught it when we did, I would be going through treatment.  I consider myself very lucky, that the edges were not cancerous.  However, I have to go back in a year, for another colonoscopy.  

I've been out of work for a few months, without any savings, and we are hand to mouth, until I start working again.  My husband hasn't had a day off in weeks. When he's not at his job, he's picking and scrapping metal for the recycling place.  My kids are with my sister several hours away.  I miss them so much, but I didn't want them to see me this way.

I'm so happy to finally begin to get a glimpse, of the light, at the end of this dark tunnel.  I feel you so hard, right now.
