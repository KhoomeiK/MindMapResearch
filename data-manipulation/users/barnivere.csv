ffxiv,fev4z9y,t1_fev20bs,1579393159.0,"Here we go with the ""You're justifying harassment"" argument.  


If that were the case, I'd be taking one side in this mess of an ordeal, yet here I am being impartial. If anyone is justifying harassment it's the person who decided to get themselves and reddit involved in the first place.   


Is a game more important than someone's well-being? No.

  
Could Dingo have left the game for a while and stopped using mods after his initial 10 day temp ban? Yes.  


Could he have not said the things he said after initially taking someone's rant from the lodestone and reposting it as his own? Yes.  


Could his harassers have left the issue alone after their friend left the game from what Dingo did? Yes, but they also chose not to.

Did he choose to get harassed? Of course not, but for every action, there's a reaction.  


Could OP have left it alone instead of making things worse for Dingo? Yes, but they chose not to because they believe that they're ""Helping"" in some way, all the while making things worse.  


Could OP have shared all of the story and not just one side? Yes. But they chose not to.  


A lot of this could have been avoided, a lot of it didn't even have to be brought to our attention.  
Now here's a question for you and everyone here on this faux outrage train.  
Would you all have had your arms up in the air screeching for every other person harassed like this? Or are you just picking and choosing?  
Lets not forget that this community has a habit of brigading themselves without taking any kind of information into consideration, just what they have at face value."

"" **After he got banned for 10 days he told some twitter people that he wasn't using mods or that he wasn't going to use them to try and get them off himself, but they did find out in the end that he still used them** and that made them more upset, as he was still ""risking"" the shutdown of XIV for them. ""

He still used mods after getting banned once. Harassment or not, the first ban should've set off flags that ""This is a warning, don't do that.""  
After the first ban, SE has every reason to ban him again."

Dingo caused someone else to leave the game. D**ingo already had a previous ban for 10  days for using mods** too, so obviously Dingo isn't as innocent in a lot of this stuff like OP claims. Dingo was a douche just like his harassers, his harassers just so happened to get back at him 10 fold for the stuff he did behind his second twitter."

Don't get me started on FFXI though, I played for 10 1/2 years, remember ffxiwindower? Lol 

The same thing happened to Dingo, but the thing is, Dingo made another account, used a different surname and once again, kept using mods/act etc. All while causing someone else's friend to quit (which caused the main thing in op's post to happen) The very things that got him into his predicament and was basically more fuel for his brigaders  to use against him."
