It also had groundbreaking special effects, and launched Will Smith's movie career."
funhaus,ffccdzc,t1_ffc2j99,1579796416.0,"I couldn't finish last week's episode, but Freddie is an actual friend rather than just a ""guest"". 

Would you be mad if they had Bruce, Lawrence, Spoole or Joel back on Dude Soup? They would be technically guests."
amiugly,ffana3e,t3_esklhi,1579739951.0,"Honestly. You look much older than 23. Get rid of the bangs, they make your face look pretty flat. 

You're not ugly, just average looking."
AskReddit,ff4h7c5,t3_erhu3x,1579563529.0,"I fucked up my knee in highschool. Playing soccer was limited to goalie basically. Can't really run anymore because of how much pain it'll be in. 

Had a dream once where I was playing soccer and I was running as fast as I could. I looked down at my legs, moving without any pain. 

Woke up and I had never felt more depressed after a dream."
netflix,ff43glz,t1_ff3svte,1579554711.0,HBO Max will have them.
AskReddit,feldd07,t1_fekn1v7,1579219526.0,"It's getting better. 

Jon, Ryan and Alannah add a fresh new perspective. Jon especially. He's the wildcard in most videos he's in. He's the only one I've seen that has made James and Elyse both break. Which is a rarity."
funhaus,fel38d9,t1_fekf4by,1579213096.0,"I've been following the Funhaus crew since the old IG days. I have maybe seen a dozen AH videos that didn't feature the FH people. 

I'm sure I'm not the only one."
movies,fejrrk9,t1_fejr26u,1579184226.0,"Just because you personally liked it doesn't mean it was a good movie. 

There are tons of movies I like that just get shit on. I recognize they're bad, but I still like them."
videos,feja97h,t1_feja347,1579163838.0,"I mean fertility is implied if we're asking about kids. 

Honestly by that point, if we've slept together you would know because she would have told you. Or you both find out together after you try for a kid and nothing pops out. It's kinda odd that you assume women just know if they have a working reproductive system or not."
videos,feja0kz,t1_feiz0bz,1579163496.0,"Yes. 

If we think we might go the distance we'll ask if we ever want kids. It's not really that absurd of a question."
videos,fej9iwg,t1_fej4ulg,1579162823.0,"Nah dude. You said it, you're *literally* a racist Nazi now. 

Context doesn't matter."

todayilearned,feeqjei,t1_feef1vg,1579039087.0,"Yeah I had no idea about 3 king's day until a few years ago.

Lost out on so many presents.

Now my parents all of a sudden celebrate it for my sister."
movies,febd2ry,t1_feaae4b,1578957607.0,"Hell the beginning shows us that clearly when that soldier is laying on the ground with his guts out, crying for his mom."
todayilearned,fe6hs3j,t1_fe6h0mn,1578891307.0,"People who are single probably. 

Or just someone who really needs to support a family. 

Had a friend that worked for some Oil company. He would be stationed somewhere for 2 weeks, then off 1 week. He said everyone working there was single, divorced or cheating with hookers.

Made good money though. He lasted 3 months, but he had managed to save 10 grand. After taxes and paying all his bills."
funhaus,fdvy7v2,t3_en7q2v,1578753126.0,"This was hilarious.

It's rare you get to see James lose it like this."

Come during the peak of summer with 100% humidity. 

Had an ex from up North come down once during August. We went to the museums. I was in jeans and a button up long sleeve shirt, she was in a summer dress. She started basically crying because of how hot and humid it was."

funhaus,fdsutoy,t1_fdqtfqc,1578708225.0,"Never said it wasn't making money. 

I also said large original IP. 

What's the last original IP that Disney dedicated an entire section of the park to?"
netflix,fdo789a,t1_fdnswch,1578600100.0,"I chose You season 2 first because I knew it would be easier to watch. The story structure is easy to follow, and the characters don't have a heavy backstory as the Witcher. 

I took my time with The Witcher. I watched 1-2 episodes a day. Finished it a couple days ago. I'm glad I watched You first. The Witcher left me with more questions, more discussions than You. Had I watched You second I might have still been thinking about The Witcher."
funhaus,fdnosmf,t3_ema2ni,1578590103.0,"Avatar is still popular among a lot of people because it's still the only large original IP right now at the park. 

Everything else at Disney is based on preexisting IP. Star Wars is not hitting the numbers they want because it doesn't seem exciting for many people anymore. Especially with how Disney is treating it. 

Also let me get these comments out of the way. 

""Dances With Wolves in space."" ""Ferngully."" ""It's Pocahontas with blue cat people."""
mildlyinfuriating,fdnmp0v,t1_fdn9wfc,1578588996.0,"I pay for premium. 

It supports creators. I watch a ton of YouTube content and it's nice to not have ads anywhere. I've had Google Play Music since it launched and then YouTube premium got included with it when that launched too. It's a nice added bonus."
mildlyinfuriating,fdn9h46,t1_fdn4hc2,1578580826.0,"YouTube doesn't have a monopoly. It's owned by Google who runs YouTube at a loss basically. 

It's a free service that lets anyone upload huge file sizes, and let's you stream them anywhere, also for free.

No one will ever be able to offer that. Some have tried, but they can't handle the price."
Pontiac,fd58po4,t1_fd55249,1578175249.0,I'll give that a try next time. Thanks.
Android,fcw68c4,t1_fcw38e1,1578018095.0,"Nah. 

Much easier to just pay. 

You do you bro."
Android,fcvmq4o,t1_fcvgyds,1578005424.0,"People on this site always say to support creators. Yet piracy is always highly upvoted. 

I pay for YT Premium because I watch a ton of YouTube content. Everyone who just comes in the comments going ""hurr just get cancer it gets rid of ads."" Yeah for that one device. With my premium account there's no ads on my phone, my PlayStation, FireTV stick, and any other devices that have YouTube available."
Android,fcvm3ky,t1_fcvgeno,1578005035.0,"Had an ex that did a bit of YouTube. She said she earned more from people with premium than just regular. 

He content was skewed for a younger audience, so not a lot of accounts. I pay for premium so I'd put her videos on in the background to help her out.

This was a couple of years ago, so I'm not sure how things have changed."
funhaus,fcuzbbo,t1_fcuocex,1577991505.0,"Yeah vacuuming and drawing or painting are exactly the same. Of course we all notice flaws. 

It's different when it's something you create. Out of the hundreds of paintings and drawings I have made I let people see maybe 2 dozen. Ask any person who draws if you can comb through their sketchbook. They'd rather die. It's basically our diary."
funhaus,fcunet2,t3_eiylsk,1577984716.0,"Did she okay you posting it here? 

Have to be honest, as someone who also draws, and I felt like one of my pieces wasn't good. I wouldn't want someone to post it online. 

Artists are their worst critics. What you may see as looking great, to her she'll see every imperfection in that drawing."
samsung,fcuhjhf,t1_fcug9gg,1577981109.0,"I highly recommend Nova Launcher too. 

Allows for a ton of customization over your home screen. 

Samsung themes is also great. Make your phone your own."
KitchenConfidential,fctphnw,t1_fctkop2,1577952886.0,"Especially Halloween. 

With it being Saturday everyone will be out getting candy or at a party.

Same with the 4th. That's dad's time to shine on the grill."

I'll definitely will be revisiting it again. Will probably pitch it for our next movie night."
