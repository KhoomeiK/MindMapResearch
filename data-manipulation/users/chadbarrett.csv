marketing,fgz0ghj,t1_fgyzybl,1581189313.0,"For sure. I understand, but I’m just pointing out that there is absolutely a significant market you’re missing out on due to stubborn clients confusion with how value works. If you want the client just tell them it’s hourly. Like you said, they have no way of knowing. If anything, if they think you’re spending 20hours a week and their campaigns are working, they will feel like all this success is due to all your hard work and they can’t afford to lose you."
marketing,fgyzzvt,t1_fgyyx5j,1581189137.0,"Most marketing clients these days don’t like to work off output. They find it too hard to justify those hourly rates. It’s just the reality. If you make it about output, they just shop around until they find a marketer who won’t charge 100 an hour, but instead secretly adds hours to makeup. So the marketer who plays the stupid game wins out. 

It’s best just to overbill for hourly"
ShitPoliticsSays,fgyyfjf,t1_fgywwe9,1581188657.0,"This isn’t about China’s immediate personal benefit. Uggg... it’s about China developing an alternative global financial infrastructure to allow other countries to compete and work outside America’s sphere of influence. Chinas short term losses are due to losing the trade war, yes, but this war will end eventually, and as those links show, China is going to have a much larger global reach and room to develop, than it ever did before America started abandoning its roll as global leader. I provided several links showing China entering. We’ve empowered their belt and road plans and China 2025 strategy. Please do research outside of Fox News talking heads who are paid to tell you “ahktshuly here is another partisan we found to tell why Trump abandoning our leadership role is a good thing MAGA build the wall!”

China has no problem playing the long game while trump thinks he’s winning. Chinas global development takes years and now that we’ve just let China take these vacuums, we aren’t getting them back. 

If Rudy didn’t break any laws, and wasn’t doing quid pro quo when he would visit VZ on behalf of trump then take huge oligarch payments for “consulting” then you can’t criticize Biden. You can’t. Rudy is far more obvious and immediately impactful. You are so partisan and so hooked up trumps dick you literally can’t apply the same logic to your own team, you use on others. It literally means your just a useless partisan shill. You don’t care about logic you just care about “defending my team at all costs! Intellectually honesty matters not!” I at least admit biden is shady, and his son at the very least got a job he doesn’t deserve so Burisma could impress a VP and bragging rights. I’ll at least admit that while I don’t see any foul play evidence, it’s still possible. But you’ll defend your god endlessly as flawless and innocent. A fucking mobster...

Also STOP LISTENING TO PEOPLE LIE TO YOU! Trump does make money off secret service. Whoever told you otherwise is lying and never listen to them again. It’s 650 a night for a room

marketing,fgywp4u,t1_fgyt9re,1581188123.0,"The problem is clients insist on paying hourly. They think, wait you only spend 2 hours a week on my Facebook campaign? Yeah I’m not paying you more than 100 an hour for that job! So marketers have to go, “fine, it’s actually 5 hours a week” and then they dick around for 3-4 hours

I had to explain it like having a shitty boss vs a boss every one likes, and how everyone wins when everyone wants to work together... like he’s some child. 

I don’t think these people understand nuance one bit. It’s just “fuck these euro Lib faggots”

The same guy saw no problem with Rudy getting far contracts from oligarchs right after entering countries on behalf of the president to do personal and professional work.

Ask_Politics,fgypy2a,t1_fgyetb7,1581185716.0,Yep. It reminds me of the Clinton “I am a political outsider and progressive because I’m a woman” schtick. It went very very poorly with the public. A career politician can’t claim outsider because she has a vagina. She can’t claim to be a disruptive progressive because she gave birth. It’s insulting
legaladviceofftopic,fgypivt,t3_f0u8cs,1581185571.0,Probably not. The president just needs cause. Cause can literally be “because of his actions I don’t feel comfortable executing my lawful duties around him.” I mean he could file a complaint but it won’t go anywhere. They tried with Comey because he admitted it on TV but that defense was “Yeah I figured him because of the investigation. He leaked documents which politically hurt impeded with me.” People forget that Comey leaked stuff. But it was clear retaliation but still legal.

Then one day I bring it around the corner to get a better quote and hopefully within reach of affordable. And I get pulled over... because the plates were pulled for no insurance.

And you continue to not give a shit the presidents personal lawyer who works on behalf of his presidency as well, is directly getting kick backs from these oligarchs.

We didn’t even get I to trumps abandonment of TPP just handed China the entire south East Asian region into the Chinese economic model rather than the western sphere of influence. Lol. 

There is no reason to believe biden made his decision because his son. Literally none. It was a top down demand from Obama. What’s most likely is Burisma hired a VPs son to try and gain access. 

But good job ignoring all the shit Rudy does. That’s all excusable.

And dude, “why haven’t they arrested Hunter if what he did was so illegal?” The whole reason is because the plausible deniability. Hunter worked for a law firm defending Burisma and was hired on directly. You can’t prove shit. Especially when Hunter has nothing to do with his dads long known and standing position on getting rid of a corrupt prosecutor. 

But you don’t see anything fishy about Trump sending Rudy to Venezuela to work on something’s for him, then immediately an oligarch contracts him for several hundred K? The personal lawyer of Trump just coincidently gets contracts wherever he goes when working for Trump? When he was threatening to withhold aid on behalf of Trump in Ukraine, it’s just a coincidence MULTIPLE corrupt oligarchs we’re buying his services. It’s not weird that wherever Trumps personal lawyer does business, he gets contracts from the rich out there?

Maybe they don’t tell you this shit on Fox News because they have you convinced only to trust and listen to news sources who have an agenda to protect the GOP and Trump. That you only trust news from places who literally have an agenda and purpose to spin narratives? “Don’t trust anyone who isn’t acting as my personal lobbyist” is some mobster shit."

And Obama had less than 1t by his end. He lead in with a high deficit because the economy tanked and needed govern,ent spending g to avoid a depression. Trump inherently a fixed economy, then immediately jacked up deficit spending to deep recession levels. Read the damn article 

And yeah, I will criticize Hunter. He got a job because a Ukrainian company tried to curry favors. This shit is run of the mill shit. It had no impact on Bidens decision to demand firing a corrupt prosecutor as this was part of the plan long before hunter got a job. This prosecutor was a know defender of the oligarchs. 

But you turn a blind eye to the millions and millions trump personally pockets by diverting the entire executive branch to his expensive properties every month.

And it takes up to decades to even get a change through. And many of these issues don’t have nearly the political priority to make such a huge change. Democrats like me for example don’t mind the electoral college because I understand it’s purpose. I wouldn’t be okay with Dems changing the constitution with the sole purpose of helping their elections (not that they even would get 3/4th the states and legislature even agree to such a partisan move)

ShitPoliticsSays,fgy2pvy,t1_fgy18nf,1581178939.0,"Leaders need mandate. Us having a large military means people corporate out of threat and obligation, rather than choice and trust in our leadership.

Vs a boss who you trust is a good leader, follow his orders because you think he makes good decisions, help with his vision because you can trust he’s looking out for everyone. 

One form of leadership is forced and loses mandate, where the other is earned and voluntary. All trump is doing is forcing our allies to look elsewhere. They don’t want to deal with the asshole boss and are looking around for alternatives and less reliance on “working with us”

Why dont you care that Trump literally hired these people? Why don’t you care the most experienced people in our country are resigning only to be replaced with blind unquestioning loyalists like some sort of dictator?

And what great numbers? The economy? Sure it’s chugging along at normal expected rates, at what cost? He’s paying for this economy on loan. He’s got the highest year over year deficit. It’s over a trillion now. All that deficit spending which is fucking insanely high and something he campaign AGAINST, is the only reason the economy is chugging along. He’s literally putting us into more debt for short term gains. How is this not an issue for fellow conservatives is wild! It blows me away no one cares that the only reason he can brag about a moderately decent economy is because it’s all on loan and needs to be paid back with interest.

He literally seems to only care what pseudo eastern alliance dictators care about him. 

America needs unity and all he does is shit on our institutions and fellow Americans. All he cares about is political gain and doesn’t have a shred of tact nor respect for anyone but his henchmen. I can’t trust a guy who has a constant stream of people resigning because they say he doesn’t know how to lead a d endangers American interests.

This is how they think. I see it ALL THE TIME. For example, if you told me “men are more violent because testosterone” I would agree that’s a fact. But I wouldn’t immediately recoil and say, “what? So what you’re saying is men should all be on testosterone blockers? To just basically neuter all men? Is that what you’re saying.” No, because a fact is a fact and doesn’t mean pointing out a problem with that fact implies some reaction. It just raises the issue and maybe have conversation. But these wokies here pointing out family breakdown and they think what your secretly trying to say is women need to go back to the home and become obedient housewives with no passion in life.

It’s so so so common with them. It’s why I can’t criticize democrats without them assuming I’m somehow claiming Republicans are better and we should support them. I’m sure everyone here experiences this phenomenon constantly. And I’ve yet to figure out WHY this exists. Normally this is a trait reserved for the poor called “slum speak” which is a product of poor communities needing unification, respect, and trust at all costs. So they always defend their side and people at all costs no matter how wrong they are. It’s about defending your group, which you definitely need for survival, and you take any insult or critique of people in your group like it’s a personal attack. 

But that’s a trait with poor struggling communities. Upper middle class sissies aren’t really seeing a whole lot of overlap, yet this trait is soooo common. I don’t get it. It’s frustratingly like a trait they all seem to have."

The fifty cent army and Russia’s past tactics to sew unrest, arent secrets. Documentaries and lengthy articles are written on it.

Finally, criticism of my preferred candidate? Are you trying to say I’m saying that the reason why I think people criticize trump and republcians is because I’m republican myself? I’m a socialist who campaigns for Bernie dude. That sub is all over Bernie. I draw my conclusion not to defend republicans but because this toxic strategy is a well known Russian tactic all over the world (prop up the extremes, get them to hate each other as much as possible, then get the groups to tear the middle the middle apart through their fighting and division). 

I point it out because it’s obviously HELPING the right, and feeding into Russia’s goals of divisions. 

Maybe it’s you who can’t take criticism of a sub you like? “Oh no, my spaces wouldn’t fall for propaganda and narrative control!” Go to that sub.

He provided cases where presidents made money, then gave sources, then you don’t care and just skimmed through to look through something trump didn’t do. You’re more focused on spinning anti trump points, which is fine, than talking about the specific subject."
TheoryOfReddit,fgurn6d,t1_fgurgar,1581127848.0,They don’t include hate for themselves. Russia influencing one aspect doesn’t mean they fully control the narrative about everything from end to end.

Entrepreneur,fgumqau,t3_f0hzpf,1581124617.0,"Not a first but one I’m just finding out about. A customer was a family friend and went to me because they trusted me for a large large purchase. Well during the process, I explained everything to them and it seems like they missed a part that was financially critical. Since it’s rarely a problem, I didn’t realize they didn’t understand it could become a problem. Further, my vendor made a mistake but I didnt catch the mistake and my trusting customer just signed off on everything no questions asked. 

Now I’m finding out the issues a year later and I feel terrible. They didn’t get the good deal they came to me for and I promised them. A mix up on both sides and misunderstanding allowed me to mess up and not be as meticulous as normal. 

I feel terrible but I’ve had the worst year in my life recently so I can’t make it up to them for 10k right now."
centrist,fgum65o,t1_fgul2xm,1581124251.0,"Of course these radicals are everywhere but my perception of how the right extremists are treated, from long as I can remember is met with eye rolls. Just about all MSM besides fox and talk radio, universally minimize, mock, and dismiss, the crazy republicans. There has always been a media pressure to not be republican “or else”. And even how these radical republicans were met around normal life it was always “crazy aunt peg watches too much Fox News, amiright?” Or “Uggg we are talking about this stupid bathroom thing again? Time to ignore the one instance I hear of it complained a year.”

But when it comes to the left crazies, I see much more mainstream acceptance and widespread of their message. I see media outlets like SNL and Daily Show getting “woke”. I see cancel culture attacking everyone the left doesn’t like. I see calls for censorship making actual progress. 

The difference is the right is no different than it used to be. We as a society already know how to avoid them and deal with them. They’ve been around forever. Same old crazy aunt Jill shit. When some crazy neo nazi drives a car into someone it’s UNIVERSIALLY condemned across the board. When it’s people throwing fire bobs into ICE facilities there are lefty’s arguing why it’s justified because “punching nazis is good”. That’s the problem. The left is trying to match the rights crazy, but with far less scrutiny or push back."

todayilearned,fgu38qs,t1_fgu1tzj,1581112787.0,"Large democracies can’t be agile. Small democracies have very cohesive and similar populations who share similar goals and values. Large democracies do not. And large democracies run the risks of power consolidations which are much easier to spot and stop.  So the USA by design is meant to move so slow that no tyrant can ever rise to power. Politically speaking, it’s probably the most safe in the world from ever collapsing as a democracy. Simply amending the constitution takes a generation. Government is designed on purpose to crawl and be dis functional because tyrants rely on agile and quick mechanism to allow for a rapid power grab that can happen before people realize their situation. Hitlers rise took only a few months to have full control, that’s impossible in America. 

So while America loses some of the benefits of being really flexible and highly functioning. Like Denmark who can go from concept to full reform in just a year, America is meant to be slow for security. We will never be like Denmark. 

And I don’t get your last part. America wasn’t nor will ever be flawless. Mistakes happen and over sights do as well. But as the saying goes, “don’t let perfection be the enemy of progress”. Even with the mistakes and less than ideal outcomes, it’s still vastly better at the end of the day if Russia or China were in charge. Not even close."

todayilearned,fgtk5tu,t1_fgt6l2r,1581105553.0,"Do we have a criminal justice issue? Yeah, but it’s not remarkably different than most west nations. In fact we are still considered one of the least corrupt countries, even with out problems. If you look up democratic health metrics, we are totally fine. Maybe not top tier Scandinavia with their well functioning and efficient government but it’s still amazing. It’s part of our security design in our democracy to be slow moving, unlike tiny and highly agile Denmark. 

But America is still great. Compare America with China or Russia. Our of the three, there will be one country who fills that power vacuum. Our of the three, america is WAY ahead of the competition in that regard. We aren’t openly killing journalists, secretly imprisoning political prisoners, consolidating power, corrupt from end to end with open bribery, and so on. 

So when these are the choices. I’m glad America did what she had to do to remain the global leader rather than hand it over to Russia or China. God what a scary thought if they were in charge."
tuesday,fgtj0vo,t1_fgtfeq9,1581105108.0,"I’m a progressive liberal, but I hate this decry of more and more funding. We don’t need more fucking funding. We are the highest funded system in the world. My district is well funded but near the absolute bottom. 

This should be deregulation republicans fucking spear head. The left and right know it’s broken and hate standardized tests. Looking at my district, it just balloons year after year, on administration. One of the dozens of 250k a year super intendants now need 3 direct staffers instead of maybe one. But they can’t afford to give teachers a cost of living raise or more than 150 a year on supplies. It’s all a fucking gritting scam with admins bloating the system and hiring their friends. 

And to make it worse, each administrator in the office chain is heavily incentivized to fudge performance numbers to not just help funding but more importantly, their career. An admin wants to join a school and show “wow look I improved graduation rates 5% and not a single expulsion! I’m amazing” failing to show that those numbers are entirely from just systematic changes which simply push kids through more easily, fails less, and removes punishment (one school a kid brought an unloaded gun and didn’t even get suspended because that would be a HUGE black eye suspension and risk their job)

Trump coming in on the seeming attack against Mexicans pretty much guarantees long term failure for the party west of Florida. 

I remember one debate where the GOP, and Fox News literally colluded the entire debate. Every question was cleverly planned to setup attacks on Trump. They were way more open about it than the DNC 

Seriously I blame the retarded radical libertarian wings of the party.

I feel like republicans tried to make it as divisive as possible to drum up controversy on an otherwise anti idpol president. Because he specifically said how he avoided racial comments to not allow republicans to distract from his character. He even warned Hillary not to make anything in her campaign about sex. He was literally known as a person who struggled to for, u it’s between groups but republicans absolutely refused to work with him on anything.
