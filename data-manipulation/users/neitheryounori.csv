>the majority of people are forced into a system they don't have a lot of say in. I'm not saying there is nothing we can do differently, but picture this.

harrypotter,fcyd4yv,t1_fcxzj6v,1578078347.0,"Yeah. I also think it was weird how he was sorted into Gryffindor. I get that it makes sense for the plot, or else otherwise how would he be friends with the other three. But both the 'coward' and 'evil' versions of him conflict so much with Gryffindor traits.

As a sniveling coward like the movie version makes him out to be, he is the antithesis to the bravery trait in Gryffindor.

As a person with self-serving ambition strong enough to betray his friends, he is the antithesis to the loyalty trait in Gryffindor.

I get that people can change, but surely the Sorting Hat would pick up on his potential to be the opposite of Gryffindor. Or did he just have very strong, but very fickle loyalty, based on to whoever could serve him best at the time? According to the wiki the Sorting Hat deliberated for five minutes between Slytherin and Gryffindor for him, but I just don't get how his Gryffindor traits outweigh Slytherin."
