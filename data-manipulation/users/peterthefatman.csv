It’s already hard to see the screen unless you have it at full brightness, even then there can be glare. Now add dark mode and that text is literally impossible to read. Also on Reddit it’s a lot harder to distinguish between a same level reply and a reply to a reply. Dark mode is really useful for... dark settings. But sometimes dark mode isn’t dark enough. I’ve had times where I’m in bed and I feel like it’s not at the lowest brightness yet.
