AskSF,ffvv36i,t3_evhu3y,1580274129.0,Why are you asking this sub? If you want real stats do a Google search or check consumer reports.
AskSF,ffvufcm,t3_evhdgf,1580273566.0,"I don't really think moving to SF is gonna change you as a person. Like whatever your hobbies are, you can do them here. Sure there geographical and cultural differences between SF and NY but wherever you go, there you are."
AmItheAsshole,ffvt2il,t3_evhpu2,1580272445.0,YTA. Clearly you're being more negative that you think I'd your wife is so adamant about you changing your outlook.
AmItheAsshole,ffvsm31,t3_evhquo,1580272079.0,INFO: how do you figure they tracked down your address? Do you have reason to believe this is not a coincidence?
AmItheAsshole,ffvsik9,t3_evhohe,1580272002.0,"Hmm I see where you're coming from and would also be bummed if my SO didn't want to eat my cooking but ultimately YTA if you don't let him at least try the shake route. I myself practice intermittent fasting and don't eat a breakfast or lunch meal, and it is seriously annoying to have a family member get butthurt that I don't want to eat whatever they're making for lunch or breakfast. This way of eating really works for me ( I do snack through the afternoon) and I would never guilt someone into changing their diet as long as they're healthy."
AmItheAsshole,ffvkm4x,t3_evgkn3,1580266332.0,Yeah 3 weeks is waaaaaay to early for me to consider posting someone on my Instagram. YTA if you keep asking her. Also consider that as a camgirl she may make more money feigning being single.
AmItheAsshole,ffvjpyc,t1_ffvj6mi,1580265733.0,"Wow, never would have guessed that. As an American, my default guess would be Grett-tuh Thunn-berg. And yeah the correct pronunciation is a bit difficult to do, but not impossible."
AmItheAsshole,ffvhcaz,t1_ffvgo2b,1580264126.0,"It sounds like both of you are having your own internal struggles with depression or some other factors, so this isn't really a question of someone being an asshole. I would suggest couples therapy as it sounds like you guys are having trouble with clear, open, and honest communication."
AmItheAsshole,ffvh3zk,t1_ffvg050,1580263974.0,Your feelings are completely valid.
AmItheAsshole,ffvh006,t3_evg0ut,1580263901.0,"Well accents are a thing you know, and foreign words are sometimes difficult to pronounce. So NTA for correcting him once or twice, but ybtwa if you constantly nag him about it. Btw what is the correct pronunciation?"
AmItheAsshole,ffvgomn,t3_evfxcc,1580263691.0,NTA. It's common sense to do laundry in the day.
AmItheAsshole,ffvghi1,t3_evfwtb,1580263562.0,"Ybtwa. It would cause drama which it sounds like she thrives on. Also unfortunately it's not unheard of for a jilted woman to falsely cry pregnancy. Look, if she has the kid, your friend is gonna find out one way or another. I would stay out of it and let things settle on their own."
AmItheAsshole,ffvg16v,t3_evfv52,1580263262.0,Mismatched libidos are NAH. Might want to post on r/relationship_advice.
AmItheAsshole,ffvfwyk,t1_ffvfmpo,1580263183.0,Honestly his reaction is bizarre and you shouldn't swear off cops just from this one interaction.
AmItheAsshole,ffvftfp,t1_ffvedjl,1580263120.0,"I know this is tough and I'm trying to be delicate, but is it possible that your feelings are stronger than hers?"
AmItheAsshole,ffvf2lc,t3_evfouw,1580262619.0,"NTA... WTF? Honestly how you look is completely irrelevant, his reaction was insane. Did you say hi, wave or anything? How far away from him were you when he said that? Is this some sort of desolate street or a well populated city street?"
AmItheAsshole,ffvdzuy,t3_evfj9n,1580261895.0,"NTA, completely inappropriate thing to say!"
AmItheAsshole,ffvdux4,t3_evfh46,1580261804.0,"NAH. Everyone has a different love language and she may show you she loves you in otherways. There are five love languages: Words of Affirmation, Acts of Service, Receiving Gifts, Quality Time, and Physical Touch. It sounds like your language is ""acts of service"". This doesn't mean your gf will also do these for you. Is there another way she expresses her love?"
AmItheAsshole,ffvdktj,t3_evfj7n,1580261614.0,NTA if you told it just like that without getting overly gruesome. Your friends overreacted.
AmItheAsshole,ffvcw0l,t1_ffvce8i,1580261146.0,"It sounds like OP wrote the apology, and they didn't get a response back. So I would say no, this person has not accepted the apology if there was no response OP. But you haven't really told us any important information: **what were the messages?** I don't think you can say YTA for not accepting the apology if we don't know what the transgression was."
AmItheAsshole,ffvcmmx,t3_evfc96,1580260970.0,NTA if you were in such early days of planning and hadn't gotten tickets or anything yet.
AmItheAsshole,ffvbt40,t3_evf8ja,1580260422.0,YTA. Don't nearly all professional theater productions have multiple casts? It's not some novel concept. Also can you write out your acronyms I have no idea what GC or UIL is.
AmItheAsshole,ffv9umj,t3_evewbr,1580259108.0,"YTA, while your idea/rule was good in theory, in practice your daughter is abusig the rule and making her brother her chauffer because she knows he has to pick her up. I think it's good to have a ""call me in an emergency, no questions asked if you are too drunk to drive"" rule, but I highly doubt that these circumstances are emergencies given that it happens every other week. Daughter should be allotting money for a cab/Uber when she goes out. If she wants to drink, fine, but it shouldn't be on your son to be her personal Uber. Especially if she doesn't reimburse him somehow."
AmItheAsshole,ffuwnuy,t1_ffuvvde,1580250754.0,I don't doubt at all that it happened because it's not clever whatsoever lol
AmItheAsshole,ffuq7de,t1_ffswia4,1580247220.0,"That's totally okay too! You can tell him that sexuality is a spectrum and you are unsure about where you lie on it. But that any sexuality, whether fully gay, fully straight, bi, pan, questioning, etc. would never change how you feel about your son. But don't expect him (or don't wait for for him right then) to tell you he's gay (or bi, or whatever, we don't know). Just let him know you couldn't care less, you will not see him any differently. Well not that you don't care... But I think for kids wanting to be normal/fit in, it's helpful to show that this is not a big deal, it's not gonna change anything between you, and it's just all cool. Hopefully that makes sense!"
AmItheAsshole,ffupjmb,t1_fftghjt,1580246844.0,"Oh definitely, I don't think OP should say ""Hey son I'm bi, sooo.....*nudge nudge wink*""

I think approaching the subject of sexuality as a spectrum is a good place to start. And emphasizing that all areas of the spectrum from gay to bi to straight are okay, and OP makes it clear that he will always love his son so much no matter where he falls on the spectrum. But then rather than expecting the son to say something about his sexuality, OP could then say that he himself is unsure where he falls on the spectrum, and that's okay too!"
AmItheAsshole,ffsvqqm,t3_ev1vxr,1580194397.0,"Ywbta if you did that. I would say if you want your son to know you support him no matter what, a good start would be for *you* to come out to *him*."
AmItheAsshole,ffsvlpj,t3_ev1umt,1580194230.0,"NTA, I'm sorry your parents and relatives aren't supportive. I'm guessing you live in a conservative area? Know that there are places that are much more open minded and would openly accept you for who you are, and when you're old enough you can move out."
AmItheAsshole,ffsv6gi,t3_ev1dut,1580193737.0,"NTA NTA NTA. What is his argument?! How is this ""not about"" him telling you he jerked off to you, when clearly that's what this is about?"
AmItheAsshole,ffsv19o,t3_ev1lvz,1580193570.0,"Well either NAH or ESH, because technically you do owe them money if you do the math, but not $6. Everything was split 50/50, drinks and Uber, right?

The total amount spent that night was ($15+$24) **$39**. 

39÷2=$19.50.

You payed $15. You owe **$4.50.**

So it's not $6 like they say, but it's not 0."
AmItheAsshole,ffsuhrg,t3_ev1ogz,1580192965.0,"Uhh yeah, YTA. You guys are desperately scraping by, with what sounds like no cushion. You are given a place to live under the condition that you actively look for permanent housing. So you obviously should be saving every dollar for a security deposit for an apartment right? Well $1000 is not an insignificant amount to contribute to a security deposit, and you spend it on vacation instead."

AmItheAsshole,ffsnzm1,t3_euzrsu,1580186692.0,ESH. Don't use that word. You are just as bad as the other guy using slurs. Slurs are bad. Racist slurs are bad. Homophobic slurs are bad. It's not hard: don't use slurs.

AmItheAsshole,ffsn6my,t3_ev0jvh,1580186021.0,"NAH. You have no obligation, but I don't think you should be thinking of whether or not you have to do this. Doing something nice for others should be something you want to do, especially if it is at no burden to you."
AmItheAsshole,ffsmvxp,t3_ev06xv,1580185778.0,"YTA, not for reporting their comments, but because as an intern you shouldn't be poking fun at higher up employees. You're brand new, basically apprentice level, so playful jabbing isn't really appropriate here."

AmItheAsshole,ffsfjm2,t3_euz8ag,1580180462.0,"NTA. Wow. It's time for gf to either start studying the DMV handbook, or look into public transportation/Uber. You're not a chauffer."

Earwolf,ffrjvg7,t1_ffr09hw,1580159515.0,Yes!! I also think having guest names in the title is the best way. #3 shouldn't even be an option lol.

I mean honestly the highlight of my week is when the main feed and pro version HH drops. And I do feel like Scott comes off as a little prickly now, which idk if I've picked up on just from listening to HH, but I think it's a combo of that and some things he's said in Threedom and CBB lately."
Earwolf,ffjq4fo,t3_etrbde,1580004108.0,"I used to be like you, I was obsessed with CBB and Threedom and didn't ""get"" HH. Til I kept seeing people say it was the BEST podcast so I listened to like 10 in a row. And now I absolutely 100% can assure you it is THE best podcast of all time. In fact over that last year I have pretty much stopped listening to CBB and Threedom because I would rather listen to HH reruns."

I end up finding most natural fibered affordable items at Everlane. Some things are over $100 but they're 100% wool, cashmere, silk, etc. They do have a nice work pant that is poly but it's a technical fabric and feels nice imo.
