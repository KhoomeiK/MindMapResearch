dogs,ffxdr15,t1_ffxdkpa,1580323068.0,"Just general discussion and reading over the years. I wasn’t implying you were incorrect, I absolutely believe you. I had just always been told that most personality changes happen during adolescence and young adulthood."
dogs,ffxd8x1,t1_ffxcteq,1580322771.0,"Interesting, I’ve heard of that happening when they reach adulthood but not in the middle of adulthood. Do you have any books or journal articles on his behavior as a mix that you would suggest as a vet?"
dogs,ffxcqju,t1_ffxcgib,1580322472.0,"He’s a rez dog. Lab with american bulldog, german Shepherd, border collie, regular collie and a dash of pit according to Embark. Personality is 1000% lab though. The most intensity He has is when I’m holding a marrow bone."
dogs,ffx7xk1,t1_ffx74ah,1580319620.0,No they don’t have toys or anything that could cause a fight. They just said they looked over and Remy was going after the other dog and they needed to pull them apart.
dogs,ffx7r7i,t1_ffww7qt,1580319515.0,"That’s a really good idea, I’ll give them a call. With that many dogs even someone well versed in dog communication could miss something for sure."
dogs,ffx7m48,t1_ffx6kol,1580319432.0,"I think they mean a good daycare would have video for everyone’s protection given you have a pack of animals in one area that may have never met each other, not that they aren’t trustworthy."
dogs,ffx6xaq,t1_ffx6ny5,1580319025.0,"That’s a good idea. They did say Olive got amped up and jumped in when the other dog fought back to defend himself, but I would have expected that given how bonded they are and the daycare was unconcerned about her involvement."
dogs,ffwwvuu,t1_ffwwupf,1580312849.0,Lol no.
dogs,ffws4z9,t1_ffwrus9,1580309700.0,Yes they will allow him back. The owner noted how out of character it was for him. The plan if we decide it’s safe to bring him back after meeting with a vet and a behaviorist is to keep him in a back room with his sister after their nap in the afternoon.
dogs,ffwrtow,t1_ffwrqbu,1580309484.0,Not my intent at all and we have no plans to take him back until meeting with a behaviorist and our vet first.

IsItBullshit,fdczhnv,t1_fdbaka6,1578289005.0,"I overheard a girl at work getting shit from her boss for taking three weeks (unpaid) maternity leave. I also didn’t get any PTO as a full time employee for the first full year I was in this role, company policy. For an employer with about 50 full time employees. Luckily my boss is pretty chill and let me take pretty much unlimited unpaid PTO, which I took full advantage of."
Dogtraining,fdcsdj1,t1_fdbktoo,1578282949.0,"We got her tested with embark :) she does have some Aussie in her, but she’s definitely [Catahoula leopard!](https://imgur.com/a/j1EZfdn) 

She has a much longer [snoot](https://imgur.com/gallery/0Rr6VjU) than that photo makes it look."
Dogtraining,fdcrh6r,t1_fdbaytq,1578282238.0,"We went through a local training business. If you happen to be Minneapolis based, I can’t recommend the k9 coach highly enough."
Dogtraining,fd9ujii,t3_eked51,1578238238.0,"We have a 1 and a half year old Catahoula/border collie mix that we unfortunately acquired at 5 weeks. I spent every available minute getting her socialized with as much as possible. She has always been an absolute rockstar with other dogs, showing our foster dogs how to dog, being the tester dog for new dogs at daycare, she’s great!

With some humans she was an absolute nightmare. Since around six months, Olive has selectively barked with very short warning at people in public. We’ve been through about a full year of different fear aggression and behavior modification class. Right now we are on vacation, and felt confident enough for Olive to join us. You guys, she’s been SO amazing. We had to walk through a fricking casino to get to our hotel room and she let people come up and pet her!!! Lights and noises were going off randomly, a kid ran by, she just looked at me for reassurance every once in awhile and went on her way. I want to cry, she’s such a good girl and worked so hard with us on this."
aww,fbjty71,t1_fbjiw2c,1576939984.0,Consider fostering once your little nugget gets a little older! It gets so many dogs out of the shelters and into a warm home before finding their people. Having the privilege of watching a dog fresh from the shelter slowly come out of their shell is one of the best things in my life.
