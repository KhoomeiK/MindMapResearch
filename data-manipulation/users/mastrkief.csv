I think we keep Van Pran but my gut tells me we lose Jones.

I think we're still in the mix for Evans and I'd still like to see him be a dawg but Kirby's comment about our locker room culture needing a facelift has me leaning towards it being better that Evans isn't a dawg.

When I did them yesterday, getting just Gibbs put us ahead of Bama but behind Clemson. Getting just Edwards put us still behind both. 

Now getting either puts us ahead of both. Something must have changed in the last 24 hours. I know that the final rankings came out but I thought it was on Monday.

What a freaking offseason we've had already.

1. Top 3 class, maybe higher, with 4 blue chip WR's which was an area of drastic need.
2. #1 QB recruit from the 2021 class commits to us in Jan

4. Goes out and gets a stud OC with a fantastic resumé whose offensive philosophy is big plays, downfield passing, with a balanced run game.

Probably not a fair comparison though since Shanahan's offense is very complicated and we had a center in 2015 who hiked it into his nuts at least once a game.


Either way, I'm stoked about the hire. 

1. All but 3 starters on defense coming back? Check

I hated that we kept putting Fields in all season in random spots or in obvious running situations, but I see why Kirby did it if he was concerned with losing Fields.


One of Fromm's best games last year was Florida when Fields didn't play at all.

CFB,fcvdlap,t1_fcv4dey,1577999876.0,"Georgia is a good counter point to that though. We haven't won a natty but have 1 playoff game win, 1 sec title, and 3 sec east titles in the 4 years since Kirby took over. Not to mention top 3 recruiting classes 3 years in a row and likely about to be 4."
CFB,fcvdc3p,t1_fcv16v4,1577999723.0,"They are, but if you exclusively read /r/cfb ever since they lost to LSU you'd think they were close to being relegated to FCS."
georgiabulldogs,fcv6tmb,t3_ej3d5t,1577995844.0,You must not have been on this sub a lot this past season.
georgiabulldogs,fcv6pdd,t1_fcv5fee,1577995774.0,"We would kill our recruiting reputation with future recruits if we pulled a kid's offer at the last minute because a player decided to stay a 4th year.

Programs like LSU are already getting bad press for doing it a couple of months before NSD. Doing it in between NSD1 and NSD2 would be such a bad look."
georgiabulldogs,fcv4yu1,t1_fcuxpy0,1577994750.0,"No and he stated he fully intends to come back to Houson.

But it would be pretty funny if Dana convinced him to shut it down so that they could try again next season only to have him leave."
georgiabulldogs,fcv4vv0,t1_fcuvgna,1577994701.0,"This is a bit off topic but I always found it weird when people refer to running backs in that manner. Like referring to a college kid as the bell cow or a thoroughbred. It isn't weird to me when people say something like ""that kid's an animal"" or ""he's a beast/monster"" but saying ""he's our bell cow"" just sounds derogatory. 

Might just be me."
georgiabulldogs,fcv4j2y,t1_fcuypu3,1577994491.0,"I can guarantee you that Swift staying would have 0 impact on Evans coming or not. We've been recruiting these guys for years and ESD is in December before a lot of guys have announced whether or not they're staying.

No way we'd pull someone's offer at the last minute because another player decided to come back for his senior season."
georgiabulldogs,fcuzozc,t1_fcuybvi,1577991712.0,Great take by Kirby. Thanks for sharing!

georgiabulldogs,fcuxxv1,t1_fcuurgq,1577990742.0,">Kirby made it abundantly clear last night that that mentality is a “disease”.

How so?"
georgiabulldogs,fcur30r,t3_ej0vfm,1577986781.0,"He confirmed that he has already signed and is enrolling early so he won't be able to keep it a secret for long.

That being said, he already tipped his hand at where he's going when talking about the position coach he's going to play for:

>The backs he has put into the league, one of them went to and won the Super Bowl his rookie year,"" Evans said.

Gotta be talking about Sony, right?

EDIT: Also, every single CB has flipped to Georgia. As late as last week there were still a number of them for LSU."
CFB,fcsy2y3,t1_fcr31vs,1577928003.0,"I completely sympathize. That's how all Georgia fans felt after the natty two years ago.

Like if any 1 of 4 or 5 things had gone our way we would have won. Especially the miscalls from the refs. 


And then the game finishes and you sit there thinking ""why aren't more people outraged about this? How do we appeal? Is nothing going to be done?""

It gets easier but never goes away."
