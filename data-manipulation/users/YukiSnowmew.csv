MurderedByWords,fewhml3,t1_fewggps,1579410731.0,"> I think that was pretty obvious in my comment considering I said ""if it has an atmosphere"". From the pictures they took, it looked like it had an atmosphere, but it's also the possibility that it's a gaseous planet.

Woops, sorry. That's what I get for Redditing when tired. For some reason I didn't even register the ""if..."" part."
MurderedByWords,fewg45t,t1_fewddjw,1579410015.0,We've found many planets in the habitable zones of stars. That doesn't automatically make them habitable. Mars is in the sun's habitable zone and it's a wasteland.

Got new headphones for Christmas. No pain whatsoever.

I think this mostly has to do with the pads. If they're new and soft, they won't push on your glasses so much and it won't hurt."

firefox,feengfv,t3_eoro8r,1579037305.0,"Firefox should be found in `C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox`. The logo is wrong, too. That's an old Firefox logo that isn't used anymore.

Seems like pretty obvious malware to me. I'm concerned that you needed to ask. Don't click suspicious links. Don't download suspicious files. Don't open suspicious files. Use uBlock Origin. If you're getting viruses, you need to learn more about computers, especially if you can't tell when you have one.

Install and run Malwarebytes. It should clean that up for you."
