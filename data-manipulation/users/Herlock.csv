501st,fffihur,t1_fff4zup,1579884687.0,"I feel that Rian was going for something different, not specifically for the sake of shitting on what abrams did. It's mostly the clear lack of direction for what was to come next that led to this. Lucasfilm failed at planning it's stuff.

And disney is too busy looking at internet polls to make something spirited and genuine. So each time internet has a ceisure, disney changes everything to please the fans.

Which doesn't work obviously.

For all his faults, lucas had a focus and artistic integrity... that's the main difference between now and then. Sadly he is not a good director :/"

Watercooling a red camera is mostly for the glory of doing it, no one is going to replicate it because the sole purpose of the video is to show it can be done, and once someone did it there is no point doing it again.

If you remember old videos of linus (nowadays it's way more steamlined) especially the vlogs when they moved to the new location you can see how much he micromanages.

And you can tell from his video : he has a lot on his mind, and simply can't keep up with everything anymore.

In your twenties you were fine pulling all nighters with friends in a club and going to work the next day. Later on you can't really do that anymore.

He is saying that many games don't cost 60 euros... you willing to support the developper by buying such games isn't relevant.

What killed the game for me was clearly the unsatisfactordy ending... after hyping it up to death it just comes across as kinda mundane, almost dumb.

Felt like they pulled a JJ Abrams LOST on me with that one :("

Jaws shark looked bad and kept sinking, so they showed most in ""first person"", or just the fin.

In both cases it emphasize the fact that it's a sneaky predator that can get you anytime he wants. And since you can't see it, you don't know what he is doing, just like the human characters in the film."

It's worse than that : there is ""thinking that could help"" and ""being fine with doing it"".

In this case they thought it was a good idea (which is stupid), but they also did it which means they are totaly fine with that kind of tactics (which is two faced / evil / whatever you want to call it).

It really doesn't reflect properly on warren imo. I am not american but I sure hope for the sake of everybody that democrats can get their shit together and get rid of the republicans so I keep an eye on what's going on.
