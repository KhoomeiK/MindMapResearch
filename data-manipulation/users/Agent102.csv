SuicideWatch,feoz4ad,t1_fenoh09,1579308534.0,"Yeah, I should probably give it a try. Can't be worse than now. I'm worried I'm going to fall for some girl who just sees me as one of ten guys she could have hooked up with. I suppose that's a risk no matter where I go to meet people. I'm great at obsessing over women who pay me any attention at all. It's sad how often I think about this girl I only sort of dated over 2 years ago. 

I'll need to clean my house before I'd be okay having anyone over. Maybe buy a TV too.

What do you do once you get matched with someone. Like where do the two of you go? All I know is the cliches like restaurants or movies.

I've never seen Buffy the vampire slayer, but I've heard of it. And that's pretty much what I do, video games and shows. I'm glad you get to do that with your kids. It's not nearly as much fun alone.

Anything else you want to talk about? You said you were in the military? That's interesting."
SuicideWatch,fen10s7,t1_femfsy2,1579274563.0,"I'm a guy. I've heard it's constant rejection for men and a smorgasbord for women because it's already filled with desperate men who have given up most of their standards. That's why I haven't tried it. Well and because I'm lazy and afraid.

What do you like to do when you're with your kids?"
SuicideWatch,felwcdr,t1_fel2uvy,1579232570.0,"I used to feel bad when I forgot to take the medication they gave me too. I took Lexapro for awhile and it made me feel almost high. Like everything was brighter. I felt.. better I guess, but mostly just more numb. I took the one your on now at a lower dose and like I said it made me feel fucked as hell. And then I took citalopram which didn't do much besides the regular side effects you get from all of them.

I suppose I should give tinder a shot. If it's a cesspool then maybe I'll fit in. Lol. My situation is because I'm a coward. All I do is live in fear.

How many kids do you have? How old are they? What is your happiest moment with them?"
SuicideWatch,fel44gl,t3_epmh3y,1579213647.0,"Yeah sometimes. My dad would be devastated. Other family members would be upset, but I only care about my dad. The rest would quickly get over it because at the end of the day I'm not a part of their lives.

My close coworkers would care, but mostly because they'd be stuck in a rough spot if I suddenly stopped coming into work. I'd leave them a note with all my passwords, but I wouldn't envy the unlucky bastard that has to wrap their head around the convoluted way I manage Adobe CC licenses. Eventually they'll hire someone who actually still cares and they'll realize how much can get done when you have someone who likes the work and spends more than 3 hours a day on task. Ultimately they're better off without me.a

The rest of the employees on campus would be shocked to find out what happened. Most of them know me, but I keep a professional distance and I put on a good act I think. I don't think many of them have any idea how unhappy I am. Maybe there are signs that they didn't pay attention to. Like when Robin William's killed himself and everyone was surprised cause he seemed so full of joy, but when you go back and watch some of his movies you can kinda tell he's putting on an act and there is a miserable person just below the surface."
SuicideWatch,fekqfyk,t3_epf8vl,1579205479.0,"Just don't go if you are going to be expected to pay for any of it. They told me the state would pay for my visit and for the most part it did, but they still found about $2,000 in charges that I ended up being billed for months later.

It's boring. /u/throwaway9174481047 pretty much perfectly describes it. It's like prison with friendlier staff, fewer steel bars, better food, strange rules, and therapy. If it's free or you feel like a serious threat to yourself then it's probably worth it. If your going to pay and you feel like you just need a break from it all then book a vacation. Almost anywhere will be cheaper and more fun than a hospital room.

When I went there was a gay patient that hit on me the whole time. He even offered me a blowjob with no reciprocation. I declined because I'm not gay, but it was really flattering and it was fun being part of the ""in crowd"" for once instead of the wierd guy, which is all I am to people out here."
SuicideWatch,fekktxd,t1_fek2dyf,1579202137.0,"Do you feel like the therapy and meds help at all? I took venlafaxine for a little bit, but all it did was make me damn near lose consciousness everytime I stood up after sitting down. I hope you'll be okay without the anxiety one until you can get a refill.

I'm glad to hear that you got 50/50 custody of your kids and you get to see them. Too many judges just hand full custody to mothers on the assumption that they are automatically better care takers. This irritates me to no end since I grew up in a broken family where our mom was the one to suddenly walk out on everyone, so she could pretend she was 20 again.

Out of curiosity what do you do to meet the people you see for company? What do you talk about with people you met recently? I've never been in any kind of relationship, not even a shallow fling and I just don't understand how people do it.

I've been going on mainly for my dad, so I get where you're coming from when you say you keep going for your kids. Sometimes you wish they'd just disappear so you can have the easy way out, but I'm sure they appreciate the effort you make for them more than you know."
SuicideWatch,fekdbvs,t3_epg8rn,1579197664.0,"Don't go. Once you check in you can't leave. Doesn't matter if you checked in voluntarily. If your psychiatrist doesn't want you to leave then you don't leave. And all the while you are stuck in the mental hospital making macaroni art and eating hospital food with doctors watching your every move you are getting charged more than a stay at a 5 star resort.

If you thought you wanted to die before then the bill for a multi-day hospital stay will put to rest any doubts you may have had.

Inpatient treatment is NOT worth it if you're the one paying for it. Go on a cruise instead. You'll spend less and get more out of it."
SuicideWatch,fek1pfp,t1_fejxlo7,1579190725.0,"Yeah, I always thought it was bullcrap. That sucks. Would have been nice if it gave you a better outlook at the very least.

What is your ex's name? Have you been seeing anyone since? I assume your doing the therapy thing since you are getting the addictive anxiety meds?"
SuicideWatch,fejxd6f,t3_ephmo5,1579188017.0,"Out of curiosity are you more upset that it didn't work or relieved that you are still alive? I've heard that people who fail their attempts report that after trying they had these moments where they change their mind about it.

I'm just wondering how true that is."
SuicideWatch,fejvkuj,t1_fejb2y6,1579186855.0,"Not OP, but I'm in the same situation he's in and I hear this a lot. ""It's not all it's cracked up to be"" and I'm sure it's not, but I'd like to try it at least once and make that determination for myself. And I feel like lonely virgins in their 20s would appreciate and enjoy a shallow one night stand a little more than someone who does it often and easily. Like how a starving man enjoys a meal more than a well fed one. It seems like these shallow, short term flings in your 20s are part of finding a good long term relationship. It's when you learn how to be a good partner and you find out what your looking for in a significant other. I don't know, maybe I'm just kidding myself.

Everyone my age is settling down, getting married and having their first kid and I'm still wondering what a vagina feels like and how to kiss someone because I have less experience than most 14 year old boys.

I feel like what's probably going to happen if I don't kill myself is I'll end up a 30+ year old virgin and some woman I barely know who wants kids yesterday will push me to marry her. I will because I'm desperate and don't want to be alone forever and then I'll be stuck in an unhappy, probably sexless marriage with a kid."
SuicideWatch,fbf6asp,t1_fbdz4sd,1576802675.0,"I am a coward who is too afraid to try. I could try online dating, but I won't. Girls I'm attracted to intimidate the shit out of me and frankly I have no idea what to say. I wouldn't know how to ask one out even if I was brave enough too. Girls don't want spineless cowards anyway. I'm 24 years old and I've never so much as held hands with a girl, never kissed anyone, I've had one sad try at dating a girl in my entire life and I only got that one because of luck. I haven't seen her in over 2 years and I still think about her sometimes. We weren't even a thing. We had 2 awkward dinners before she told me she wanted to just be friends then we went to 2 house parties (literally the best time I had in my whole life) before I said some stupid shit and fucked it up. I haven't seen or heard from her since. I imagine if I actually managed to get someone to date a pathetic loser like me it would be like dating a 14 year old, except most 14 year old boys probably have a little more experience than me.

I've made these promises to myself that I'll get myself out there and try. ""I'll go do online dating and meet someone"" I tell myself, but all I do is make a profile, answer a few questions about myself, send nothing messages to a couple girls who seem cute and then I get cold feet and quit. I used to tell myself ""oh it will happen one day, just keep working on yourself. Girls don't want a depressed wreck."" I don't think it works like that anymore. At least not for men. If you don't have the confidence and drive to go after women yourself then you get nowhere. It's just easier to give up hope. If I don't have hope then I won't be left disappointed.

All that was a long time ago. Few things sting worse than having to relearn the fact that I will never have a girl who wants me."
