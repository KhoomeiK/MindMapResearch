LetsNotMeet,ff25anu,t1_ff241ae,1579494206.0,Good. Ok so I would suggest going to a different sheriff with jurastiction in your county. Tell him that there was no relationship between you and this freak other then coworkers. You never saw him as a friend just someone you work with. Physical evidence should be enough to put him in jail. If you can't do that I suggest a restraining order. He cant cant get close and if he does boom instant jail time.
LetsNotMeet,ff23vr6,t3_er1dqp,1579493095.0,Can you move towns? Maybe even a few states away? Only tell family your moving. Just put in a 2 week notice at work and leave.

Thetruthishere,feq6o2o,t1_feq5he4,1579338282.0,Meditation visualizing energies around a person's body. Finding out the color association between auras and personalities. Doing personality test on people to see what colors they would associate with. Squinting at people to see the energies then move on to try and see the colors. It takes years of practice.
