Would you recommend letting it ferment for a while, and then adding honey (once all the yeast is dead)?
Or do I really need to stop the fermentation. It's a first try, so I won't be expecting the best mead, but I'm satisfied as long as the end product is sweet and alcoholic"

cheesemaking,ff182s4,t1_ff13mko,1579476138.0,"Of course! The first 2 cheeses were simply rushed. I stirred the curds too fast, used a whisk, and didn't wait as long as I should have for the curds to set. The third and fourth and fifth had too much rennet, were stirred too vigorously, and were just as dry as the others. I also used too much buttermilk (my culture). This made the cheese bitter, dry and sour, but the moisture content was a bit higher. I got lazy and didn't press the first 5 cheeses since I didn't have a press yet. That part is super crucial. Presses are apparently easy to make. 


The first 6 cheeses were brined, and I so far haven't had success with brining. I think I prefer salting the curds, nd then pressing. Makes the cheeses dry easier too, so they can be coated sooner.

It's hard to pinpoint what caused a bunch of these cheeses to fail so badly. I think the biggest factors were salting VS brining and impatience. 


It's no guarantee that this cheese will work out perfectly. It might be too moist from the inside, who knows. Or maybe it's undersalted snd won't turn out nice. Only more to learn.


TLDR: be patient: cheesemaking takes a huge part of your day, and there are a lot of factors that influence the end product"
