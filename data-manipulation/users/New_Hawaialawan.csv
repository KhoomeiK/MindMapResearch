I’ve been doing fieldwork in the Philippines for 2 years now (social science; methodology of participant-observation and semi-structured interviews). I’ve been really interested in the intricacies of language as I became more fluent in Filipino.

You mentioned that linguists ask the speakers themselves whether it would be considered language or dialect. The people here would definitely say Bisayan and Tagalog are different languages, although they have a ton of similarities. I would not understand a Bisayan speaker however. 

The role of colonialism also plays a role here. Philippines was colonized by Spain for 300 years than the USA for around 40 years. The influence of Spanish on Tagalog and other languages here is slighter than you would imagine. People tell time here in Spanish but use local language for counting numbers. The exception is a language called Zamboanga which is highly influenced by Spanish. People use English for certain modern words like refrigerator (“ref”) while car (“kotse”) is based on Spanish. 

However, the vast majority of folks here cannot speak English despite the fact that English is considered one of the two national languages."

I’m also a final year (hopefully) ABD PhD candidate in social sciences. I too am reconsidering academia for many of the reasons you pointed out, although my entire undergrad and material career my sole goal was to become a professor.

I enjoy research and writing and have several single-author publications already.

I have a colleague whose sole goal was also a faculty position but after he graduated, he was unable to land a job at a university (he severely limited himself geographically because of family). Now he works for ngos and government funded organizations doing more practical and community-inclusive projects. He told me he’s never been happier doing that. But, I have a difficult time thinking outside of the box and figuring out a way to envision a future outside of the academy.
