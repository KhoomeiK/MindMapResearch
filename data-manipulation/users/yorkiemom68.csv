exchristian,ff927x0,t1_ff8hqfw,1579703031.0,"Thanks so much for your reply. I’m sorry you deal with panic disorder as well. I’m much better today than the day I wrote, as I’ve had a chance to decompress. I hadn’t had a panic attack in about 15 years. Even while still in church I had begun counseling ( christian) but I at least had a counselor who taught me some skills to managed them. I still tried prayer and other faith based things that worked. My overall anxiety never began to truly improve though until I stopped believing in heaven and hell, the rapture, and an omnipotent, omnipresent god. 

That part you wrote about god using panic attacks to get to you because he loves you us truly awful though not surprising. What a horrible concept that a supposedly loving god is allowing your suffering. That also follows that somehow if you were a better christian you wouldn’t have panic attacks. 

It sounds like you’ve done a lot of hard work to be where you are. Thank you again for the response. It helps to know you’re not alone."
exchristian,ff38gxv,t1_ff1fmr6,1579536170.0,Yeah this has mental illness written all over it. Strange how clinical mental illness can have a lot of religious undertones. ( or overtones) . Needs psychiatric care
lookatmydog,ff32fmv,t3_er61ra,1579531918.0,Looks quite pleased with himself!
Yorkies,ff2zwim,t3_er9uvz,1579529884.0,I have a pillow snuggler also! Very cute
exchristian,ff04hvz,t1_feyputf,1579465125.0,So strange. My parents have called me that since I was a preteen and trying to express my own thoughts. Hippies are cool people anyway!
exchristian,ff04a1f,t1_feyjed6,1579465040.0,Thanks for your kind words. It helps
exchristian,ff044zb,t1_feyhi9d,1579464986.0,"Thank you. It actually does help to have some external validation. That indoctrination lies deep, I think since put in there as a child."
raisedbynarcissists,feyr1f4,t1_fetc3fr,1579449535.0,Yes. Anything by John Bradshaw. “ the courage to heal” is really good. “The body keeps the score” by Bessel VAn De Kirk. “ The Verbally abusive relationship “ by Patricia Evans
exchristian,feyhpqt,t3_eqwkpu,1579445735.0,"Yeah, I relate.  ""baked into you"" is an excellent metaphor.   Also I am not sure I was actually taught coping skills. The only skills I was taught was to have faith, pray, tithe, come to church, fellowship with believers..... Learning coping skills came from secular sources.  Therapy has been really beneficial for me."
exchristian,feyh5ql,t3_equr7e,1579445490.0,I would laugh if it weren't so horribly true
