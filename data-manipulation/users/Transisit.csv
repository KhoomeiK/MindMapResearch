However, this is how it was explained to me as a layman: copyright infringement is “are you selling something that doesn’t belong to you?”. Trademark infringement is “could your product be reasonable believed to be coming from the parent company?”. The latter is how Disney takes down everything from fan art to signs with the “Disney” style font.

So IMO a smaller version of a real life product could be seen as being endorsed by the original producer of that product. That is enough for a trademark violation."

Even now I’m on a diet again and my starting “oops I’m getting fat” weight was 167lbs, and that’s only because I have an eye for what I look like when I’m getting obese"

You also want a baseline weight so you can see if they’re growing properly, or at a later visit see if they’ve lost weight (which can be an indication of other bad things going on)"
