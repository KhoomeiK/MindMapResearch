When i was a teenager my gramps taught us about all sorts of financial stuff (stocks, bonds, shareholders, compounding interest), and i have taken economics classes... 

Sadly none of that knowledge seems particularly relevant in a world with bailouts, growth stocks over value stocks and random news headlines & tweets dictating the market!

It has been wild the last few years when negative economic news can send stocks higher because they feel the Fed will set 'better' policies on interest rates. I have been watching over 10 years expecting the Feds policies to fuck over the economy and changes to be made that would benefit the average younger worker like myself.

Instead all i see is an inflated stock market, and housing/rental prices that keep me from even being able to participate in stocks and retirement savings like i was taught. I see mainstreet economy getting worse and worse for millenials like myself, while Trump and policy makers celebrate the longest bull market in recent history and higher returns on their real estate investments.

Washington,fdf08s6,t1_fdevymd,1578350390.0,"As someone from Washington i agree that taxes are disproportionate. Its not fair, and ive never understood why sales tax is so high, being a regressive tax that affects poor people the most.

 As an adult i also dont like the gas tax. Im sure California has higher gas tax, but WA state is 49.4 cents for every gallon.
