CasualConversation,fcl63jk,t1_fcl4paq,1577740610.0,I have a question. Since you do cross country I would guess you have pretty good indurance?  If so I think a good sport that you may want for try out would be lacrosse. Lacrosse is pretty fun because who doesn’t like hitting people with metal poles to get a rubber ball to chuck at someone(I swear I’m not insane) it is pretty physical. And if your school offers it you should try it! FYI it starts in the summer.
