MensRights,ffhx2ae,t3_etq9yy,1579957699.0,"I think it would be nice if we could keep politics out of most personal issues — if only people behaved themselves. But that’s never going to happen.

You know those weird product labels, the ones that warn “Do not use this hair dryer in a swimming pool” or “This toothpaste was not designed to be used rectally?” They seem so nonsensical and stupid to us, but apparently at least one idiot out there did those exact things. The sad thing is, there’s more than just one idiot out there, and we need laws to protect both them and us, no matter how weird or stupid they may sound. 

I’m personally pro-light. Generally speaking, I hate abortion. Yet, I’m too scared of the repercussions if we suddenly banned it. For instance, if we allowed it only in cases of rape and incest, how many men would be accused of such? The rates would skyrocket and innocent men would go to prison, because like I said earlier, people just won’t behave themselves. In light of that, I’m willing to concede and push abortion to the bottom of my political priority list. 

But meanwhile we’ve gotta make these stupid laws. “No, you can’t abort the day before you’re due naturally.” “No, you can’t perform surgery on a minor without parental consent.” “No, the taxpayer will not fund it!” You’d think they were common sense, but oftentimes it’s not so common unfortunately.  Perhaps politics *would* stay out of the snatch under normal circumstances, but we gave them an inch and they took a mile. At some point you *have* to put a stupid warning label on it."

Again the amounts might be off and as I recall the flavoring was my idea when she used a Splenda. Whizz it up for several minutes and it’ll froth up to the point it expands to fill the processor. Voila! You have to use it right away, because the froth turns back into liquid rather quickly (not quicker than you can eat it though).

It doesn’t slow down in the way I think you mean it, that if you keep up a high calorie deficit, it will eventually negatively impact your overall calorie burn. The good news is — it doesn’t work that way. You don’t permanently/long term damage your metabolism by dieting. 

The bad news is, it sort of still does work that way, just not in the way you think. 

As you lose weight, the amount of calories your body needs to move around and keep going will be lower — simply because there is less of you. It’s a good rule of thumb to check your TDEE every 10-20 pounds and account for the changes to avoid any plateaus. But your metabolism will still work the same way it always does, just at a slightly lower calorie count (we’re talking about 100 cals here and there, a slice of cheese, a dollop of mayo). 

On saying that, I do think your calorie intake is a bit low. While it won’t affect your metabolism, I am concerned it’s not all together sustainable. You can eat much more than that, stay nourished and satiated, and still get a decent deficit each day."

Before the surgery, nothing else in these people’s lives was a big enough motivator to lose weight. Their health, spouse, kids, etc., none of it was good enough. They’ve got it in their heads that surgery is the *only* way, and your regular everyday healthy diet just isn’t going to work. 

So Dr Now tells them they can have that surgery, as long as they lose some weight first. Now *there’s* a motivator, eh? They’re doing the same diet they would have been doing without the promise of surgery, but now that it’s on the table, suddenly they’ve got something to work toward — something they really want. And most of them lose what is asked of them.

After surgery though, we’re back to square one, where health, spouses and kids are the best there is again. Dr Now doesn’t have any more carrots to dangle in front of them, except maybe skin surgery.

Then take her $200 back to the Dollar Tree and buy 200 items. Oops — you’ve spent half your mortgage this month! Mom, would you kindly purchase these products at the insanely low price of $500? I can’t return them, you *must* buy them! I can’t make my mortgage payment otherwise!

Rinse and repeat until she finally tells you to stop going to the Dollar Tree. Just for fun, though, tell her the stuff is from Harrod’s."

I fill the bottom with lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, etc. and the top with whatever I feel like that week. Sometimes it’s taco salad, other times it’s chicken Cesar, I’ve done chef...but my favorite so far is pizza toppings. As long as I portion everything out and know what’s going in, my salads are rarely over 300 calories, which leaves plenty of room for snacks if I get hungry before it’s time to go home."
running,fc8e7hu,t1_fc8c9bw,1577532924.0,"I recommend Zombies Run like a broken record. It’s not a couch to 5k, and it costs money, but believe me if you like horror/zombies as much as even a casual fan, it’s some of the best running money you’ll ever spend. 

Just the basics — it’s more a game than your typical running app (but it does everything a running app does). You start off episode 1 with a walk and simply listen to the story. You are one of the characters and the other fellas are telling you what to do in this post-apocalyptic world (it’s all imaginary). From time to time, you’ll come across zombie hoards that chase you. Outrun them, and collect useful items along the way. Easy! There is also a 5K app available if you do want to build up, but the original game also has a built-in 5, 10, half, etc. 

I used it years ago when I started running, and I would often get so immersed in the story I would go ahead and complete another episode because I didn’t want to wait until the next day to find out what happened. Those were walk/run days, now I run whole episodes and just speed up when the zombies come out. The app doesn’t care what you’re doing, as long as you speed up when it says so, you’ll outrun them. I couldn’t recommend this app enough."

However, what’s the likelihood that Patsy’s specific fibers were there on that night? That’s why I’m not IDI unless she wore that sweater every single day. As I always say, if you’re going to commit a murder, do it in your own home. It renders almost all evidence circumstantial and you’re bound to invoke doubt, if not get away with it all together."
fatlogic,fc56asq,t1_fc50z14,1577445419.0,"I got fat because I hated my job. Because I hated my job, I discovered alcohol. Because I discovered alcohol, I needed McDonalds come morning, so I could have the energy to go back to the job I loathed. Rinse and repeat for five years.

Five years and about 50 pounds. 

The good news is, I stayed only as long as I had to, and jumped ship as soon as an alternative position opened up. Now I have great hours, work with mostly great people and have a great boss. Almost overnight everything changed, and for the first time in years I went for a jog after work instead of the liquor store. Thirty of the 50 pounds are now gone!

But underlying all of that was my own willingness and determination to change. Sure, I might’ve gotten a better position and stopped drinking, but it took more than just that to put on those sneakers and go out for that first run in April. I work a sedentary 9-5 every weekday now, and almost everyone in the office is overweight. They don’t have the problems I did (or at least it’s not obvious) but they let that office lifestyle, the one I’m using to *improve* my life, to still get fat because they won’t tie those shoelaces and they’d rather bring by the third box of donuts this week. 

Is there such a thing as “gumption health?” Because there should be."
