explainlikeimfive,fgtevh9,t1_fgsbcli,1581103591.0,"To add onto this if you absolutely have to go into the water to save someone who is drowning, never allow them to be close enough to grab you, but you can tread backwards in the water while facing them with a swimming method called sculling (cupping the hands, flicking your wrists to propel you backwards). This will likely trigger a survival instinct in the victim to desperately try to grab you, they will swim to you and you just back yourself to the shore and they will swim themselves there trying to get to you."

Blizzard,fgop5v4,t1_fgoky1m,1580979659.0,"Your argument is all over the place. Emotions and principles are two different things. If I choose not to invest due to decline in quality from a company I used to support, that doesn't make it an emotional decision, but one out of principle.

Capitalism is 100% driven by greed, which is unfortunate, as the almighty dollar matters much more to those chasing the money rather than producing a quality product.

Those suits that are driving activision blizzard into the ground are only doing so because other investors don't care about quality, but profits. This provides activision blizzard the incentive to keep doing what they are doing because people continue to give them money.

The only way to break this cycle is to stand with principles, along with everyone else who is a consumer, and stop giving them money."

Blizzard,fgmzukz,t1_fglgp68,1580935046.0,"Not sure why you're getting downvoted so hard. I came to the same conclusion when I was considering buying their stock as well. If I have no faith in them as a gaming company anymore, and am disappointed in the way they do business, then WHY WOULD I GIVE THEM MY MONEY AS AN INVESTMENT? To all those who would, are here complaining about blizzard as a company at the same time. That makes the lot of them hypocrites, only they're too stupid to see that, or just too greedy to care."

worldnews,fgmv9ip,t3_ezbkot,1580932697.0,"Well, certainly lots of room for speculation. People are typically much better at recognizing their emotions these days, as well as having more understanding to communicate them, unlike with the 'silent generation' where many bottled everything inside and died of a heart attack.

Of course I'm only just spitballing here, but maybe it's possible that the average person has a much more acceptable blood pressure these days, which may be a contributing factor to reduced body temp"

Windows 10 runs so many background processes on top of the GPU working hard it gets too hot, and throttles down your performance (framerate mainly) I play rocket league so it shouldn't be too much for that GPU to handle, but random frame stops made my competitive gameplay unbearable. If I were going to buy the same computer again, I would want more RAM, and an i7 processor. Trust me on this one
