I think as people we focus so much on the negative, not necessarily because that’s all there is but because it’s easier. I am proud you chose to type it out here and not completely bottle up your emotions. You don’t have to fix yourself, you just have to fix your habits. It’s an ordeal. But I know you can do it if you can run your own company. And don’t be afraid of looking weak or being laughed at for asking for help. Your friends clearly like you so I’m sure they’d be more than happy to help you and hear you out. Just keep taking it one step at a time and you’ll eventually climb out of this pit you’ve found yourself in. I believe in you, and I hope the rest of your year is full of healing and kindness."

As for any possible advice I could even give, don’t worry so much about disassociating. If you do find your dream gal she’ll like you for who you are, medical stuff and all and more than likely be willing to help you in any way she can. It’s a little frustrating, I have a boyfriend who zones out in stress or sadness, but I understand that people sometimes have to have that escape in order to deal with where they’re at.  It’s very hard to overcome insecurity, but given that you’ve made it this far I know you’ll be able to do it. If you’re ever feeling insecure or self conscious remind yourself that you are human, think of some good things about you, and remember that you have some amazing friends who have been with you for so long. Your friends show that people out there can accept you and will accept you as you are. I would say to try bring some of these thoughts up to close friends and family in small amounts. They know you better and could probably give better advice. Insecurity/depression is a beast and it is not easy to push through. Don’t fe afraid to ask for help from those you care about when you need it. I hope life gets better man."

This can be done by having a Ian o boiling water in the oven with your bread. Do not have water in pan that is not boiling it won’t produce steam in time. It could also be that you needed to slash the tops so the crust could expand while baking.
