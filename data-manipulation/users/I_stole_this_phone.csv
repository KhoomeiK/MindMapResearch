AskReddit,fcxofbt,t3_ejdlbw,1578067739.0,"My dear and loving mother. I was very young, but old enough to have a cavity. After being a good son and suffering through the dentists chair, my mother took me to a mall near by to buy me a milk shake or pick up some cocaine. I was wandering through a chain retailer trying to find where she went off to. I picked up this small lego box. It was maybe $4 or $5, which was expensive back then. I begged and promised to take better care of my teeth if she would buy it for me. In hindsight I should have asked her to buy me a toothbrush. She caved in and I was a glow with joy. I finished puting that lego set together on the way home. Mother complimented me for being a smart boy and finishing it so quickly on a crowded bus. We walked in the front door and my little brothers happiness upon our return quickly turned to suspicion. He looked at my face,  then at the lego toy I was holding, then again at my face. He was confused. He asked mother where his lego to was. I told him mother bought it for me for being a good boy. He immediately threw himself against the wall, clawing it as he slid down crying, his eyes were instant springs welling large rivers of pain and anguish. He wailed ""I WANT A LEGO!"" My dear sweet and loving mother snatched the lego toy from my hand and gave it to my cunt of a little brother. It was just a fraction of a second for me to despise this woman I used to love. shocked I looked up and asked why. A million whys came crashing into my head. Why did she buy me a toy just to give it away? Why were all my clothes two sizes to big? Why did she give in to his crying pleas for a toy? She looked at me with a loving smile and said share, share because hes the only brother I have. I hated her so much. I hated her for months and months. She could have be a total stranger to me and I would have cared more for her. She hurt me. I will never for give her. Now you are concerned for my mental health but fear not. I found my justice, my inner peace and joy a few short years later when mother discovered dad cheating on her. I have a couple of other half brothers and sisters. So no, I dont have to share anymore."
