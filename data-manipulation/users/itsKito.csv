And stop blaming mothers. It's not like he is a finished product. You can help him learn new things and if you don't want to, it is your own fault for things staying the same."

worldnews,ff8wees,t3_es5ol6,1579698305.0,Biggest bullshit. Their marketing produced our need for plastic bottles because it was cheaper for them. If they campaigned glass bottles nobody would complain but it would reduce their profits. Thats all there is to it.
TwoXChromosomes,feqe9di,t3_eq71a6,1579340795.0,"Sorry but wearing a diamond ring is pretty much the opposite of being empowered. 

Also don't talk so bad about yourself. If you really want to get married go out and make it happen. Even though it is not an easy task, there is probably no reason for it not to work out for you."
AskReddit,fee5tmy,t1_fedl0i1,1579027004.0,"Here is some deeper insight: germans have something called ""Endlautverh‰rtung"" which basically means that certain letters get pronounced differently when they are at the end of a word. G is pronounced like K ( in special cases even like Ch) D is pronounced like T. 


Also Z and S are pronounced the opposite of their english equivalents, S being the soft letter."

Go to the russian lost ark site (la.mail.ru) and register/login with your russian email.
