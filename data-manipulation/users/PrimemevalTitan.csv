custommagic,fdsbn77,t3_emwcso,1578698890.0,"There are a couple problems with this card:

1. The effect is firmly a blue or white one, and it's a complete color pie break for red to get it

2. The effect is too strong. As it it, this card reads ""When CARDNAME enters the battlefield, destroy target creature with power 3 or less."" While there are cases where the printed effect is better or worse than this, it's still far too strong when tacked onto a 1 Mana 1/1. 

3. This card creates memory issues. Normally with cards like this, the effect goes away after the card leaves the battlefield. However, that isn't the case here. Even after this card dies, your opponent is still going to have to remember whether or not the targeted creature untaps during each of their untap phases.

While I understand that this was based on the art and I think the design can be salvaged (like if it was on a 1UW 2/2), it just doesn't work on this card, though I must say I really enjoy the flavor or a goblin dentist who's really bad at their job"

custommagic,fdsbn77,t3_emwcso,1578698890.0,"There are a couple problems with this card:

1. The effect is firmly a blue or white one, and it's a complete color pie break for red to get it

2. The effect is too strong. As it it, this card reads ""When CARDNAME enters the battlefield, destroy target creature with power 3 or less."" While there are cases where the printed effect is better or worse than this, it's still far too strong when tacked onto a 1 Mana 1/1. 

3. This card creates memory issues. Normally with cards like this, the effect goes away after the card leaves the battlefield. However, that isn't the case here. Even after this card dies, your opponent is still going to have to remember whether or not the targeted creature untaps during each of their untap phases.

While I understand that this was based on the art and I think the design can be salvaged (like if it was on a 1UW 2/2), it just doesn't work on this card, though I must say I really enjoy the flavor or a goblin dentist who's really bad at their job"
