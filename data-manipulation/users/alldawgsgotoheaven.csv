SuccessionTV,ffin387,t1_ffi4c98,1579977831.0,Yes when he mentioned the “not on scale notes” (or whatever sorry I have no music theory background) it totally clicked that those notes in particular made the intro almost creepy or the vibe was a bit off. Good stuff from him.

gambling,ff93ycq,t1_ff819ov,1579704266.0,That’s how my job does it. Just pure random nonsense. Random draws after boxes are filled. Just a slower way to gamble I guess. It is possible to win every quarter which is somewhat nice.

AskMechanics,fcl9nec,t3_ehrvqm,1577742821.0,"Talking about brake pads. They are fairly easy to replace in my experience. With a popular car like that there will be multiple tutorials on YouTube. Brake pads and rotors are pretty straight forward and I found it easy to learn how to change them myself. Rotor should be fine unless you notice any kind of uneven ware or marks in them. Pad are cheap it’s the labor they’re quoting and a skilled mechanic could do all brakes in a shop in like 90 minutes. 

You’ll need a carjack, tire iron, wrenches, caliper spacer, maybe a mallet or hammer to loosen your pads. 

The pads can be found mostly anywhere. High performance will probably be recommended to you as you got a zippity doo car.
