Edit: And then there is the matter of insurance. Is there such a thing, for unexploded bombs? You buy a house, then the neighbor does some digging and finds this thing that the bomb squad can't safely diffuse and that must be detonated, possibly damaging your house. I wonder if it happens enough that it's a standard (optional) clause in insurance contracts."

All that said, holy shit OP says she is female. I would have guessed male.

Edit: we are getting downvoted now for saying that most people don't like being misgendered? Lol ok Reddit."
nba,ffyli49,t1_ffycwvb,1580349273.0,It's really weird that folks are acting like this is a common occurrence or a significant risk.  Heck based on the news alone it seems more planes are falling out the sky these days than choppers but I don't see anyone thinking twice about getting on the plane.
MovieDetails,ffyijo0,t1_ffya1z3,1580347257.0,">It helps to emphasize the fact that he’s not a madman.

If a guy who walks around in a clown outfit, operates with complete indifference to human life, devise plans designed to inflict vast suffering and despair, and casually and credibly threatens mass murder - a man famously summarized as just wanting to ""to see the world burn"", cannot be described as a madman, the word has no meaning."

75 years later WWII is still killing people. Quite amazing, really."

I understand that's how you dealt but everyone differs in this regard. I've heard the exact opposite from others: they want to talk about it and they never want to stop. But others have on moved and the bereaved don't want to bother them. 

It is precisely with that in mind that I spoke to a co-worker before Xmas. Her mom had died a couple of months earlier in the fall. We weren't close enough for me to go to her home or anything like that. I contributed to flowers back then, said my condolences, signed the obligatory card, and that was that. But in December, right before the office essentially cleared out for the holidays I went to her office and told her something to this effect: ""I know that after you lose someone the world seems to move on and after a while people essentially avoid the subject or seem to forget. I just wanted to let you know that I haven't forgotten. This the first Christmas you're gonna spend without your mom, and I can imagine it will be difficult. Know that you and your folks will be in my thoughts."" I know she was really touched by that and hopefully it helped a smidgeon. 

People grive differently, and the difficulty for others is figuring out what they need. They may not even know it themselves."

Also perplexed as to why my question/observation would be downvoted. Ah well."
ThatsInsane,ffug63x,t1_ffu12u2,1580241267.0,"Does anyone else think that a lot of drone footage looks/feels fake? I am not at all claiming it is, just that there is often something about drone footage that feels off. Can't quite explain it. 

They feel like a 3D simulation of a flight and not the real thing."
