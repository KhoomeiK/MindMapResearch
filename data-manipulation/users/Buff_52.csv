My friend who knows me since i was 2.

Person who I spent most of my childhood with, even though he was older and had different company.

I have so many memories with him, when we grew older we turned each other’s life in a good way, supported each other with out greatest milestones.

I met his now wife and him after classes.
(I would often choose different route to home to meet him so we could return home together, since we were door neighbors.)

 when she was just “person from university” and barely knew each other and he had crush on her.

When they were finally engaged ( and I was the last one to find out about it) 

He wanted to move out and live with her gf so they could finally live separately from whoever they were living with and he needed something to rely on and to get on his feet.  So I persuaded him to apply for a job I was applying for as it was the best option and he was capable of it, I prepares him best I could and he did great and now is in better place than expected. 

He moved 10 minute-on-foot away.

He didnt even invite me at least once to just spend at least one hour with him playing xbox and whatever we did while together.   I found out that they adopted a cat (he knows that cats are my favorite creatures on earth and I miss my cat so much) by accidentally overhearing his mom saying something about it. 

He doesnt even answer calls or return them when he sees them. 

His coworker, who was not friendly towards us is staying over almost 3-4 times a week, he even showed up at our neighborhood with him with bags full of snacks and stuff and said they were going to spend weekend having fun at his place and at that moment I had not seen him for like 2 months, he did not even ask me if I would like to join. 

Worst part is that he calls me 1-2 hours before his shift so I could cover it (used to work at same place) because he has sudden urge to go have fun or do whatever non important stuff he needs to do, I even caught him lying about being sick.

I dont know what got us there, or if marriage plays any role here."
