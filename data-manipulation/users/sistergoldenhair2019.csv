GetMotivated,ffib8gd,t3_etq3iz,1579969731.0,I started painting just over a year ago during a manic episode. The medications took care of the mania but lithium left me with a pretty bad tremor so i quit painting. We just discovered dropping the lithium down slowly is improving the tremor and all i want to do is start painting again but i am just so scared i wont be as good at it stable as i was manic. I cannot tell you how much seeing this today means to me. I need to stop making excuses for why i am not painting and face my fear of that voice in my head saying i can't.  Thank you so much.

My tubs last forever if i dont make it to shut it off before a new one comes on. Sucks cause Tool is best heard within the acoustics of my bathroom.
exjw,ff4fygv,t1_ff4e80j,1579562678.0,Me too. We were so close growing up. We would be total strangers now though as its been 15 years. My half brother was 6 when i got dfd too so he is a man now and wouldnt know me either. Fuck this cult. They tore us apart. My older brother was gay and quit meetings when he was 15 but killed himself at 25years old.  6 months before i was dfd so i didnt have him either. But i had my husband and his family who took me in. Saved my life. 100%.

I want her to wake up so badly. Its mostly my fault she got trapped in the cult as i was the good big sister setting an example for her. She met her sick fuck of a husband at my appartment too who was 8 years older than her when he and she began dating. She was 11 years old at the time. Makes me want to puke. 
My step sister lives in Ottawa as well but she can go fuck herself. She actually wrote me after ignoring my emails for 3 years to say she was studying and getting baptized so she would be blocking my messages. ""But i really do care about you. Please come back so we can speak again""."

I was even atheist at this point but still was afraid of transfusions. My husband who helped me to escape took it out of my wallet and after breaking through to my reasoning he tore it up with my permission, saying now that were married they will be asking me if you can have a transfusion and you know nothing will stop me from saving your life.
