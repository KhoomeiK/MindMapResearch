fatlogic,ffqtikt,t3_euoz2p,1580143292.0,So all those people on 600 lb life that managed to lose weight didn't actually lose weight?
My600lbLife,fenjrvz,t1_fenegt9,1579286199.0,"I'm assuming her 600lb life surgery was in November, and of course, the episode aired recently"
fatlogic,fen7ral,t3_epxpjy,1579278822.0,"Diets are just the way you eat. There are people who can't have certain foods because of an allergy or something else medical-related, so they need to be on a certain diet. I highly doubt that restricting certain foods sometimes don't qualify as eating disorders"
fatlogic,fekikpg,t3_ep3w7r,1579200791.0,"I guess that since I stopped snacking on empty nutritional foods, I now have an eating disorder? And I am a white supremacist? I didn't know black women can be in support for white supremacy and the patriarchy"
fatlogic,fekicvw,t3_epk1xh,1579200659.0,I'm still very confused about this post. So I guess eating as many cookies as you want isn't bad????
fatlogic,feki6j0,t3_epnalm,1579200557.0,"I just did a very quick internet search and I found that unexplained weight loss can be a sign a type 2 diabetes, so...................."
My600lbLife,fejyqhx,t3_epd960,1579188885.0,"Dr. Now should have made her lose more weight after her successful weight loss just to make sure she didn't do this temporary. Her whole thing of ""I don't think Dr. Now is right"" was complete BS. He has been doing these surgeries for decades and knows every excuse. The surgery isn't going to fix all of her problems and she kept expecting it to.

I felt like since she has a master's in therapy and did addiction counseling, she felt like she knew it all. If she actually knew it all, she wouldn't have been 600+ pounds in the first place"
fatlogic,fefxm01,t3_eoue6r,1579068587.0,So people on my 600 lb life that go on the 1200 a day diet are in starvation mode? I've seen every episode many times and no one has starved to death from being on the diet
fatlogic,fedmudn,t3_eokv7d,1579015376.0,"""your lack of understanding it is showing""? Your lack of grammar it is showing"
fatlogic,febzedj,t3_eobdi8,1578964536.0,"So someone's ""natural set point weight"" can easily be 300 lbs? I don't think your organs want to be surrounded by that much fat"
fatlogic,febysbh,t3_eocqju,1578964418.0,"So over eating food isn't your fault, the food found its own way inside of the body?"
fatlogic,febylrz,t3_eoczam,1578964354.0,So the evil insurance groups have been bribing every health care professional for decades? I'm a bit confused on the skinnified winnie the pooh also. I would like to know where this person found their facts

TooAfraidToAsk,fds5uv5,t1_fdrgvh2,1578695036.0,"When you are ready to have a real conversation about the obesity epidemic, feel free to write to me. That being said, be prepared to present legitimate scientific studies that are from legitimate scientific/medical journals and that have been peer reviewed. 

When it comes to having scientific conversations, we only talk about data and facts. The obesity epidemic is a major concern in the medical community, thus when we discuss it we do not spread false information."
TooAfraidToAsk,fdrdyxg,t1_fdrbkh8,1578683077.0,"People who have obesity are at an increased risk for some of the following: Stroke, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, some cancers, etc. 

I never said to lose weight quickly, which is detrimental to health. Getting into a healthy and positive mindset can definitely increase the chances of sustainable weight loss. Fat-shaming does the opposite. Coming from a loving and caring stance may influence more people to lose weight. 

Not everyone is fatphobic. The only fatphobic people around are people that hate the looks of fat people and want them to lose weight for beauty, not overall health. 

I would support the movement if they didn't spread false medical information about obesity"
TooAfraidToAsk,fdr709l,t1_fdr5xxw,1578680330.0,I agree with your statement that no one should be shamed for their size and everyone deserves respect as a human. But they are spreading harmful medical advice about obesity. People that lose weight for their health are considered fatphobic by people in the FA movement. Tess Holiday calls her fans fatphobic if they lose weight for their health
TooAfraidToAsk,fdr6dr8,t1_fdr4y1e,1578680146.0,I agree with your statement that no one should be shamed for their size. My issue is the fact that they are spreading false information that you can be perfectly healthy while you are obese. They have no issue that there is a rise in obese children/teens.
AskReddit,fdqyk8v,t3_eiyvwr,1578676826.0,"The fat acceptance movement started off well because their stances were: we don't want to be discriminated against, we don't want to be made fun of, etc. 

But now it turned into a movement that claims: obesity is perfectly healthy, you must be attracted to fat people or else you are fatphobic, you shouldn't listen to your doctor (or any medical professional) if they say you need to lose weight to be healthier, etc.

They thin-shame and fit-shame people, while acting like fat people are the victims. They call fat people who lose weight (FOR THEIR HEALTH, NOT LOOKS) fatphobic. 

It annoys me that they claim to be on the same levels as people of color, people of different ethnicities, or LGBT people because they can change their weight while the groups of people I listed can't change their identities. They victimize themselves while the groups I mentioned typically don't. 

I can support the movement if the goal is to be accepted as humans, but I can't support the movement as it is because they want the world to cater to them while acting like victims"
fatlogic,fdqwq4x,t3_emqf8o,1578675966.0,"Believe it or not, the FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS also applies to humans!!! Therefore we don't magically create energy in our bodies without taking in extra calories.

I bet that if I were to quarantine/lock up fat acceptance people who claim CICO doesn't work and only gave them 1200 calories a day and had them walk as part of their exercise, they would lose a significant amount of weight. No cheat days, no pop, no sneaking food in."
fatlogic,fdqv4sz,t3_emr3if,1578675284.0,"I'm sure that most people who say obesity is unhealthy are not thinking that obese people are worthless. My issue with the Fat Acceptance movement is that they claim that everyone wants them to die or they see them as not being worthy of life.

The big difference between obesity and terminal diseases is that people with terminal diseases can't be cured while obesity can. I also believe that people with terminal diseases don't act like a victim all of the time while obese people do, which is very frustrating"
fatlogic,fdnrcp0,t3_em9fvl,1578591318.0,So the rise in sugar levels from eating too many sugary foods in your bloodstream will not affect the chances of developing type 2 diabetes? Or any other heart disease?
fatlogic,fdlkyqr,t3_em00tr,1578526369.0,"privilege is GIVEN to you. You don't have to do anything to have certain privileges (white, straight, etc)!!!!! There is NO thin privilege, only FAT CONSEQUENCES. It is very easy to become overweight/obese, so in my opinion, there is a fat privilege. It is much harder to lose weight in our society now because our culture wants to make things easier and quick. Being able to eat enough food for 3+ people daily is privilege. Being able to NEVER go hungry is privilege"
fatlogic,fdkmzfb,t3_elvq0i,1578506931.0,"With all of that fat on your lungs when you lie down, there is definitely an increased risk for OBESE patients. In order to qualify for WLS, you probably need to lose weight on your own to prove you are a good candidate. Just how fat are we talking about? 20 lbs over? 300 lbs over?"
fatlogic,fdkmpuv,t3_elw2xp,1578506765.0,I love it when they act like being obese is a natural phenomenon and it is a result of genetics. Where in the past 200 years were your family members all obese?
fatlogic,fcxp4hu,t1_fcxoz1w,1578068184.0,"I was thinking that too. It's one thing to bike to work, it's another to skateboard 16 miles everyday"
fatlogic,fcxmmo4,t3_ejfiw4,1578066574.0,"I seriously want to know where people are getting these stats on the 95%-100% of ""diets don't work for weight loss"". Crash diets don't work! Change your overall lifestyle if you want to lose that weight!"
fatlogic,fcxm979,t3_ejgukk,1578066325.0,Obviously I can't diagnose. But here's the thing: humans can't break the 1st law of thermodynamics. So energy can not be created nor destroyed in our bodies (we need some kind of equilibrium). We are not magical beings where the laws of thermodynamics don't work inside of us! This person would win a Nobel Prize if their body stores copious amounts of fat and refuses to break that down into energy
