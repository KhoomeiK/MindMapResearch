Healthcare is expensive in America because big prescription drug and medical device companies own the politicians.

There is nothing about capitalism that uniquely drives up the price of healthcare - unless consumers actually demand higher quality/more expensive healthcare. Before the US passed Medicare and Medicaid and thousands of other healthcare regulations, healthcare in the US was more free market and much cheaper.

As for the rest of your post, I don't see any of it as major problems that makes me anything but extremely pro-capitalism. Businesses market to people and try to get them to use their products? So? False advertising is already illegal, along with fraud. And no system is going to be 100% perfect.

If you are a capitalist that just wants more social programs and labor protections, then don't call yourself a socialist. I believe him when he says he's a socialist. He believes all industry should be run by the government or worker councils. It sounds kind of nice in theory, except for the lack of freedom, but history has shown that this system doesn't work. Neither government nor worker councils are remotely as capable of producing excellent products and services efficiently as private businesses.

The solution is not to tear down capitalism. It's to make capitalism more worker-friendly with mandated paid time off (like every other developed country), maternity leave and overtime for all workers. I'm really not some radical. The people calling for the end to capitalism are the radicals - suggesting something that is clearly a terrible idea based on 40+ socialist countries having already tried it. And once they realize the economy is crashing, they resort to totalitarianism every time to try to force the people to produce more and quash all dissent through fear. It's not like Russians wanted gulags when they supported the communist revolution. They were told it would be a system of democracy and liberty."

This is why life in a capitalist country is so amazing compared to the horrible alternatives (although we take it for granted). We put so much careful thought, study, and effort into how to serve each other - entirely because those that are best at serving others get the most in return.

This is always true in human interactions, in socialist/communist countries or in capitalist countries, whether an entire economy or two people. The more you give to others, the more you tend to get in return. So even if you're not a selfless saint, give generously of your time and money and love and people will give back to you generously in turn."

Plus, socialism naturally leads to fascism or communism, since it gives the government the power it needs to install a tyranny. Libertarianism naturally leads to... a more libertarian country.

For example, the US in the late 1800s was maybe the most libertarian country in world history. It's also the oldest democracy with the oldest constitution right now. While more socialist-leaning Europe was plunged into conflict between fascists and socialists, Americans maintained our liberty. The rise of socialism in Europe lead to a ""reactionary"" rise of fascists, who were themselves just a different kind of socialist - almost more moderate economically in the sense that they wanted to maintain the nation state and private property, while still copying socialists' desire to use state power to perfect society and highly regulate business for the supposed good of the people."

And btw, yes, I think parents should be able to send their kid to any school even if it's one you and I may not like.

What portion of government spending actually has a positive ROI, like corporate investment usually does? Roads possibly. Enforcing basic laws against assault, fraud, etc. probably. A small military to deter aggression, maybe. That's about it. The rest of it is either just income transfers with the government stealing from one person, taking a cut, and giving it to another person - or political payoffs to special interest groups.

Many people believe the Supreme Court since the 1930s has generally abdicated its oath to the constitution with rulings such as this. In this view, it's clear that the Founding Fathers did not intend for the federal government to run large social programs, and that the text of the Constitution does not authorize federal social spending.

It's possible that the majority substituted their own point of view for the text of the Constitution and 140ish years of precedent. It's also very possible that they felt incredible pressure to rule that FDR's signature accomplishment was constitutional.

FDR had announced [his court packing plan](https://www.fjc.gov/history/timeline/fdrs-court-packing-plan) and it was hotly debated in 1937. As that link says, ""Roosevelt’s motive was clear – to shape the ideological balance of the Court so that it would cease striking down his New Deal legislation."" My theory is that the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Social Security in order to convince FDR to stop pushing to pack the court.
