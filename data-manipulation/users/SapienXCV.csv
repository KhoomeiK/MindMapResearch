AskMen,ffje25q,t3_etxszs,1579996306.0,"The secret is to consistently go, and the secret to consistently going is knowing that actually showing up to the gym is as fulfilling when your back home then whatever workout you had done that day.

You'll find on the good days you could be there for an amazingly long and satisfying workout, full of confidence and energy, and on the bad days 15 minutes of half-arsed reps; doesn't matter, once your past the hurdle of actually showing up, you'll start to enjoy the familiarity of the gym with the satisfaction of knowing your bettering yourself (no matter how slowly).

Hey presto! after a while all those small but consistent gains (+plus overall health benefits) are so motivating that you now just couldn't believe how seemingly low a priority working out was for you just a few months back, and what before was a challenge is now a part of your day that you look forward to doing."

RationalPsychonaut,ffi2tso,t3_etrda2,1579963440.0,"You should approach your situation by considering it a mental illness only if it affects you negatively i.e. if it's a detriment to your day-to-day living. LSD is powerful, and some people take a week to integrate some people could take a year. I would get into the habit of trying to be open to this new perception whilst you practice mindfulness/meditate - it might help you accept it and ground yourself on it, which may relieve the symptoms - or at least give you perspective on what your next plan of action is."
RationalPsychonaut,ffccjum,t3_esugi8,1579796518.0,Wow that's some discipline you have! Keep up the good work.
selfimprovement,ff6ym1x,t3_erzqsz,1579637567.0,"24M here with a very similar situation, extroverted when I was a late teenager/ early twenties but now very much more reserved. I came to the conclusion that I still am extroverted, but I suffer from Social Anxiety. The language your using suggests you may be suffering with a little anxiety as well atm, so  getting back into theater could do you wonders, or if you don't have time for that just practicing getting back into social situations such as making sure you meet with your mates x times more per week than you are now. 

Basically anything that puts into perspective the stress of expectations you currently have on yourself; because lets face it, the carefree, smiling girl probably didn't care whether or not she was carefree and smiling lol. That being said, maturing certainly could play a part, it's hard to live in the moment of a conversation when you have work problems, debt etc. on your mind. Good luck, and all the best in finding back your vibe!"

selfimprovement,feecxz9,t1_feebj8i,1579031186.0,"No worries, If you find a particularly good book or technique that helps with your communication skills make sure to update us! It's a really under-utilised skill and I think we could all use some more practice in learning how to listen lol"
selfimprovement,feebayg,t3_eopk9r,1579030227.0,"When I realised that most conversations were two people doing a monologue towards each other it really put into perspective how little we listen to one another and just wait for our turn to speak; which seems to be the case here if your busy thinking of a response instead of continuously listening? Because lets face it they may have made reference to what your response would be whilst you were in the process of thinking it.

 However, I think you nailed it on the head already though by wanting to engage more in the moment and that just comes with practice, I would suggest actively trying to register more with not just the words but the language theyre using, their cadence etc.

 Good luck!"
selfimprovement,feeaafq,t3_eopou9,1579029634.0,"Honestly, make your passion self-improvement, everyday just try to be better even if its only by 1%. You'll tend to find that the clarity you get when you see what your capable of really broadens your perspectives in things you can achieve- which in turn gives you the confidence to go searching for things that drives you instead of stumbling across an idea and hoping that'll be the passion you'll dedicate yourself to. Good luck!"
Psychonaut,fedb4wa,t1_fedawfw,1579006311.0,"It certainly does man, it will be interesting to hear your thoughts on it again if you do another trip log."
selfimprovement,fedary3,t3_eokf9y,1579005966.0,"Easy, firstly realise that it doesn't matter about your age and the only consequence of not improving yourself is that  you are not living up to your potential - and that's an incredible potential. I would just focus on base line improvements atm because I find that getting healthy sleep/ exercise/ nutrition is an excellent foundation to get clarity on what other developments you would like to make e.g. whats holding you back, learning a new language, drawing etc.

Try to get perspectives on what dependancies you have. We are all creatures of habit, so the power of substitution is really useful in cutting down cravings when the rest of the behaviour is the exact same (for example, I used to enjoy drinks in the evening, and I hadn't changed except experimenting in finding a good 0% beer analogue which I would buy to satisfy the taste of beer and habit of rewinding in the evening with that taste. I did this until I got more satisfaction being sober than I would from having a beer). To add onto dependencies if you are someone that binges, don't tempt fate - just cut that shit out completely, don't trust yourself that you'll have just two cigs tonight or whatever - it's just added stress than if you had none on you to begin with and you'll feel awful the next day that you let yourself down.

What else... underweight and out of shape? Go more plant-based (remember its pretty lean so have portions that would make your grandma happy and don't forget to get some good fat in you), eat lots of lentils for protein, and once you start going to the gym start slowly and methodically with static/dynamic stretches, and then become a one man army by excelling with your form when doing explosive compound movement.

Anyway good luck bro, if you think you can do well, you probably will."

Jung,fdw47z5,t3_en894r,1578754833.0,"24 as well bro and also a keen dream analysis enthusiast. When you say dying could you go a bit more into that? are you dying, or a witness to death, or even just death themes? Funnily enough I have had several dreams where there has been a monolith and people dying on top of it/ falling off it etc. Always seems to be where there is a lot of people tho like a school field, or a fair ground. looking forward to people responding to your questions!"
