loseit,ffr6z87,t3_eul24j,1580151806.0,"NSV: New bras time! I'm down to a 34H, which is my highschool band size. (Not my highschool cup size...teenage me was much less annoyingly endowed.) Hopefully that letter starts dropping soon too!"
fatlogic,ffr5qll,t1_ffr3bk6,1580151043.0,"Depends on the person...unfortunately there are no guarantees. I've gone from a 52I to a 34H so far (200 lbs down). My boobs are smaller in absolute terms, but as far as proportions go they feel just as much of a hassle. :(

Other formerly-obese people I know report going flat as a pancake, though. So it does seem to be an individual thing."
fatlogic,fe3c443,t1_fe2myqb,1578847979.0,"Yeah, what the other person said. My I cups are smaller in absolute terms because my band size has shrunk and cup size is dependent on band size. But I cups are still big as heck and feel out of proportion with my body."
fatlogic,fe0do4u,t1_fe01djq,1578811030.0,"Tbf, since you can't spot reduce, even major weight loss may not do the trick. I've lost 200 pounds and am on the cusp of a normal BMI now, and my tatas are still annoyingly large. (This is not a humblebrag, I would really like my next 5 pounds to come straight out of them, plz. If the letter of a bra size is substantially into the alphabet, mama ain't having a good time.)

It's still the best thing to try first, of course."
loseit,fe0ciur,t1_fdy0rp9,1578809791.0,"It's literally the only thing that has ever worked for mine. Every time I tried to lose weight before, I would fall off the wagon after a couple miserable months of incessant screaming cravings and ravenous hunger. There's only so much willpower in my body. This time? After a one week adjustment period, the cravings and psychological hunger went away. It was incredible, a real life-changer.

I don't know that IF will work for everyone, but I will always recommend that people struggling with these issues at least give it a try, because if it does work for them it's like magic. I only wish I'd found it anytime in the 15 years I spent dangerously obese."
loseit,fe0c4ef,t1_fdxepcq,1578809361.0,"Congratulations!!! That rush when the century number changes is the BEST FEELING. You just go around beaming all day for no apparent reason to the outside world. :)

And yay on the jean size too! Measuring by clothes fitting is so satisfying."
loseit,fe0atsq,t3_en97aa,1578808082.0,"Yep, I found the IF & CICO combo to be super effective. Killed my insatiable cravings, reset my shot-to-hell hunger cues, and basically made the whole process pretty simple. It doesn't feel like deprivation when you can have two big 600-calorie meals, or one epic feast, and still be perfectly on track.

I feel that it's what made me be able to stick with my lifestyle change this time, instead of falling off the wagon two months in. And sticking with things for the long-term is how the magic happens."
loseit,fdqxtzd,t1_fdqt5j7,1578676382.0,"I don't think I'm really near maintenance yet - with my body frame I'm going to aim lower in the normal BMI range, not higher. But my goal is to add weightlifting, if I can ever motivate my lazy ass into it. I'd like to do some body recomp, get stronger, and make my arms look a bit better (my worst obesity souvenir). Up to this point I've done everything with diet and gentle cardio. 

Oh, I guess one thing I've already started is that I'm not as anal about calorie counting anymore. I used to weigh and track every single calorie. But now I basically know the ballpark calories of everything I eat regularly, so I'm trying a more relaxed, intuitive approach, and it's working fine."
loseit,fdqs6t0,t3_emo0ok,1578673740.0,"I have now officially lost more than half my body weight in just under a year (340 to 167, with my one-year anniversary coming up on the 22nd). I'm also more than 200 lbs down from my all-time high weight of 370, and less than 10 pounds away from my highschool weight and a normal BMI. 

It's been honestly super surreal lately. I haven't adjusted to being in the 160s, or to being a basically normal size. There's some mental readjustments still to go, for sure. But it's absolutely wonderful, and I'm still in awe that it's happened after so many years of thinking it was impossible for me."
AskReddit,fctevfc,t3_eiszet,1577941032.0,"My food scale! Cost me all of $11. I lost 165 pounds in 2019, and that little guy was my most essential tool. (I suck at eyeballing calories.)"
