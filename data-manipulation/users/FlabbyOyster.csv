I was acting in good faith. I was simply trying to learn about things that nobody has ever taught me. In an ""atmosphere"" to save my life.

I make no apologies. If being as brave as I know how to be, when I'm more afraid than I've ever been, and had less support than I could ever imagine, makes me a rule breaker and a maverick, then so be it. 

Hit me with the banhammer and I will serve my time and I will return without breaking the same laws.

But ask yourself, Mary..

Were you not once alone and afraid as I am?

Did you not once also quake in fear?

Were you also not blessed with any sort of support group?

Because I know who you are and I respect you. Truly, I do. I think you're the bee's knees.

But shutting me down as fast as possible isn't too copacetic.

And, just to advise a person who is a good lady and has our best outcome in mind: I did contact a similar ""helpline"" in the past. 

They assured me they would send some plain-clothed therapists and we could talk. 

Instead they sent police immediately and I will never forgive them for putting me in a life or death situation when I was the one who called them for help. 

I will never call a so-called ""helpline"" again.

I regret speaking with the enemy because they only ever had their own interests in mind.

And I may have broken a law of yours but I have lived the way humanity must always live: at rhe mercy of one another."

Also my own friends Lance, Paul, Josh or Michael. Also my old girl Brittany and my old friend Sara, and my old flame Kristel.

For anyone else, it's a crapshoot and depends on how capable I'm feeling that day. I'm in poor health and many times it feel like getting involved will only get me badly injured or killed too.

But I would die for a stranger in certain circumstances. I have tested my mettle before and did not find it wanting.

I'm pretty suicidal most days, though, so you gotta factor that in.

Let me clarify: if I see someone getting murdered, I'll get involved. We'll probably both just get murdered together, but I'll do what I can to take the aggro.
