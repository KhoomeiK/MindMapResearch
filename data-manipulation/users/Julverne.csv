fatlogic,ff7fasv,t3_ervuu1,1579648219.0,I'm very frustrated with my home's dietary climate.
fatlogic,ff7798g,t1_ff6egsc,1579642510.0,The sad part is her weight loss efforts from before are probably diagnosed part of her EDNOS so she won't atleast do damage control and be overweight. That therapist is doing everything they can to help her kill herself.
fatlogic,feey6s8,t3_eomg76,1579043805.0,"On Facebook is a picture of a overweight girl going around and everyone saying she's healthy, pretty, and noone should say anything about the consequences of her mom not helping her with her weight. And her mom isn't even fat. The girl's situation sounds similar to when Obese to Beast was a child and got fat after medical problems. The mom insists she doesn't feed the girl anymore than child-sized portions. Steroids do that right? I thought it was appetite and water retention that steroids affected. I'm I being the jerk? The comments are very cringe too.  Some people saying she's not even that big. That she's black and that's how she's supposed to fill out. That she's beautiful like that means anything. That's just how she's built. All the fat logic. ALL OF IT. My Facebook friend that shared the post says her daughter is ""thick too"" but doesn't eat much. Anyone that says different is a bully. Those two girls don't stand a chance. This is how we're going to get to 50% obesity.  If we think we're going to stop it with our sanity farts into the tornado we have another thing coming."
fatlogic,febvws8,t1_feb1so9,1578963378.0,That opinion is very common. If you don't struggle you can't help people.
fatlogic,fdxdtgz,t3_en29tf,1578767744.0,My highschool jeans are a little tight around hips but I can wear everything from when I was 16 just fine. The real question is: should I?
fatlogic,fdsi9zs,t1_fdse0yp,1578703268.0,"It would have been prevented. She knows what needs to happen, she's just not ready to do it. She has people that are supposed to help. If she really wanted hardcore, balls-to-the-wall help she would get help where it is found lacking. There's commenters here that have had therapists be unhelpful about their binge eating disorders. They don't listen to them because they want true help. If she accepts a payed, educated, professional tell her not fitting in chairs is a matter of feelings then she's right where she wants to be."
fatlogic,fdsgyr7,t3_ems7pb,1578702542.0,"Rant #2. There's a video of Koreans reacting to my 600 lb Life. At the end they say obesity is a social issue. We can't blame individuals and society has to solve obesity together. American society says having personal standards about your own weight is triggering, if you don't eat at all times you're an anorexic health nut, and fat consequences just mean you're a victim. In their very comments someone said they looked like a ""sack of potatoes"" and a response was they shouldn't say anything bad about themselves because it's triggering to anorexics that might see. So all that fighting obesity together? That won't be happening.  Nobody cares about that.  How is a collective supposed to fight something that's so extremely internal? Everyone is going to get fatter and fatter until an outside force makes them to put down the fork."
fatlogic,fdsdnib,t1_fdrunnq,1578700267.0,"Multiple doctors told her she should lose weight, she got a weight loss surgery. She and her husband adopted a child so they get to be parents, but she still needs help or more honesty with the weight because she lost less than thirty pounds after wls and is still morbidly obese."
fatlogic,fdr9rui,t1_fdqn1jd,1578681506.0,"Thank you for posting this. All over the internet, there's the saying ""you see old people, obese people, but no old obese people."" It's reductionist and if gives the myth that you can have fun doing what you want and die effortlessly. There are old really fat people and their lives are awful."
fatlogic,fdr98hp,t3_ems7pb,1578681191.0,Another sob story about an obese woman that tries everything for fertility. Except losing weight.  I saw the couple's picture and I knew it before I read it
fatlogic,fc6rrcf,t1_fc6rkv5,1577487815.0,"Yes, kill capitalism by demanding companies to supply cute clothes on fat women. Oh wait..."
fatlogic,fc6q5hj,t3_egc9c3,1577486670.0,"I don't like the bully attitude of fat positivity. Not having fat logic isn't the a crime that deserves comeuppance for, their feelings aren't a moral law. Somebody I know was smug about a plus sized commercial and thinks if you don't be fat positive you deserve to lose money and be criticized just because it's popular now."
fatlogic,fbgtac3,t1_fbgs8u3,1576858084.0,How about when someone asks if it will make them fat with no other information? There's a lot of answers to that question.
