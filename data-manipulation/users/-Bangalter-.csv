LearnCSGO,fembmsu,t1_fembggf,1579247436.0,With jiggle peaking you press down on the mouse button at the same time as the opposite direction. If you are moving close to or at full speed you shoot right after changing direction. This is assuming you don’t want to show yourself in a fight or are in a pistol 1v1. To practice you can load a map with no bots and type cl_showimpacts 1 into the console to show where your shots land vs where you aimed them. Equally you can change your crosshair to dynamic so the bloom of the reticle shows weather your shot will be accurate.
LearnCSGO,fembd48,t1_femauan,1579247093.0,Trading is good. If you can consistently trade 2v1 then that’s good because you put it in a 4v4 and your team has extra information. Slow peaking is almost never smart unless the don’t know your there or it’s a pixel angle. Jiggle peaking is great when you’re on a pistol and it’s the best way to use them. Wide peak against awps but jiggle only your shoulder first to bait a shot from the awper. There are to ways to peak an angle standard. Either press d key until you have peaked then tap a to come to a stop. This requires muscle memory because it works better at different velocities of movements but always works well with awp. The second is to peak with d and quickly press and hold the a key before releasing d and pressing d a second time. Most of your movement in cs is a and d especially after you learn to bhop.
LearnCSGO,femaqzt,t3_epwldo,1579246318.0,Crouching isn’t good in this game since u want to stay mobile but it messes with ur hit box and most people aim for the head so you can trick good players at shorter distances.
