That's why I'm really loving Duolingo. I was awful in college French so I thought I wouldn't have the tenacity to learn another language but Dulingo is showing me that is not true. How the program is structured along with the audio has been really helpful and I'm retaining far more in a few weeks than I did in a few years of college French. I do plan on taking this further when I've finished with Duolingo. If it helps, because of Duolingo's organization and structure, it's made learning other languages easier as well."

Having a relationship with a normal joe and someone whose crazy is hard. When you have two crazies, it's even harder because its a constant check and balances.

TumblrInAction,fe6gtqu,t3_enpqx1,1578890468.0,"The cost of a salon hair cut usually has the following built-in: Chair rental (most stylists rent their chairs at the salon and what they earn is based on what they charge with the rental costs factored in plus pay for their own health insurance and other bennies), cost of the product they are using in your hair (shampoo, conditioner, styling products. Also, every stylist I know measures their hair color because not only is it so expensive but each person who gets their hair dyed needs different amount), and time to do a cut. There is also specialization and level of expertise to consider. I have a lot of hair that is very thick and curly-ish and my hair is dyed. I go every 6-8 weeks to get my hair shaped and roots done. I pay $150ish (which includes tip but I also tip heavy). If I want highlights or a laborious coloring technique, I will be paying a lot more.  


Now, if you go to SuperCuts or another chain, the stylist is probably not renting their chair and are paid hourly plus keep their tip. Chain salons also keep the cost down by not washing the hair (every chain I've been to just wets your hair down), doesn't offer services like hair dying. The stylists probably do not have any specializations. Clients are built in since people who go go because they know what they are getting, unlike a stylist who works in an indie salon who is essentially a freelancer and has to hustle for clients. The goal for a chain salon is churn.  


I budget the cost of my hair and it is one of the very few luxuries I spend money on a regular basis. If the cost of what I pay bothers you, that's fine. That's on you. However, you do not earn special ""I'm cool and awesome"" points or it makes you a better person because you whip out the $25 Whal clippers, have a friend cut your hair, or visit a chain salon and spend 50¢."

BipolarReddit,fcz51p2,t3_ejhnfx,1578093812.0,"47F. I'm Bipolar 1. Diagnosed at 17. On and off meds for most of my adult life. My 20s ( 90% unmedicated) were rough. I was working 2 part-time jobs, going to school full time, and either clubbing or going to concerts a few nights a week.  But while I was fueled by mania (sleeping 4-5 hours a night), I was not good at anything. I was failing school, spending money on concerts and clubs, while I wasn't late to work or had attendance problems, I'd randomly quit jobs and start new ones because they ""didn't feel right."" I spent all my money as soon as I got it. I made a lot of risky decisions that could have ended me up dead.  I didn't think I would make it to 40. How I was not an alcoholic, drug addict, or in jail remains a mystery to me. The only thing I can attribute is I had seen what alcohol, drugs, and other questionable behaviors had done to others and took every ounce of my person to remove myself from those situations. Things calmed down a lot in my early-mid 30s. My cycling had slowed and it was manageable without meds but I knew I would be on drugs again at some point. I had such horrid experiences with drugs when I was on them I had to find ways to cope with being bipolar and I did through a lot of self-care, mood management, and removing myself from triggering situations as well as create manageable goals.  I  was very high functioning.  I was able to graduate from college and go on to get two master's. Held a job. I had a relationship for a few years. The disease started ramping up again in my late 30s. I had a couple of breaks, was on/off various drugs that just made shit worse. I got a big girl job after all of my education but that went to hell after a couple of years when I started cycling into crisis mode now coupled with severe depression. Went on drugs again, couldn't tolerate any of them. When I went off, shit got worse. In 2014 I quit my job, left my husband, moved in with an ex-boyfriend I hadn't seen in 10 years who lived nearly 1K miles away. Racked up $40K in credit card debt. Kept moving between my husband and my ex every couple of months. I had another break. Ex knew I was bipolar and in crisis but he kicked me out and told me to go back to my husband since I was ""too exhausting."" Crashed from the prolonged mania, found a new therapist and APRN, got on a drug regime that works. I am living in the same place for nearly 5 years (before I moved every 2-3 years). I have had a good job for a year now. My husband and I are together. Things are finally calm and I'm settled.  


I accept I will be on drugs for the rest of my life.  


There are days when I miss the mania and godlike thought process. I miss being creative and creating things which while they were usually done under the guise of mania, that lack of creative activity now is depressing. I miss the intense feelings. I felt fearless. Unstoppable. That feeling is addictive.

Louisville,fcy7wwz,t3_ejfwb7,1578076023.0,"My husband moved to Louisville a few months before I did and tipped me off to WFPK before I got here so between it and Sirius that was all we listened to. Earlier this year, after five years of living here, it dawned on me there were OTHER radio stations in the area so a quick google search and found 105.1 because I am a GenXer and godammed didn't I need my morning pick up of alternative and indie music. Until I scanned their ""recently"" played list and saw they played the same 10 bands with the same 20-25 songs over the course of 24 hours. A lot of these bands, even newer bands from the '10s, have an extensive catalog! So I noped the hell out of listening to 105.1.

The second one was when I was 32 at a mental health hospital who also did outpatient treatment. That was 1/2 day and included interviews with family members. The third one was in my late 30s with a psychiatrist where we spent about 30-45 minutes during the intake. This last one was last summer (2019) and it was another 1/2 day event with a licensed psychologist who mainly does eval testing. We had an hour long interview which went over personal history, mental history, medical history, family history, academic and job history. There was another hour of testing to determine my adhd and then another 1.5-2 hour for a 400 question questionnaire. It should be noted all four evals came back with the same diagnosis (Bipolar 1, BPD, ADHD, GAD, and severe depression) and all four were done during various stages of life (medicated, unmedicated, highly functioning, barely functioning). The longer tests pull out the more nuanced features since so many diagnoses, like Bipolar and BPD, have similar presentations. Because I had presented mania, that put me in with Bipolar and since the mania was prolonged (and I've had numerous prolonged mania states), they quantify me as Bipolar 1.

I have 80 movies on my mail queue and there are probably 100 more that I could add. Right now I'm mostly using it to get TV series or films that are either international and hard to find or small runs like Pushing Daisies (2 seasons)"

mentalillness,fcvzyh8,t3_ej4d9p,1578013957.0,"Wonderfully written and very on point. I am Bipolar 1, BPD, ADHD, severe depression, and GAD. I go every five or so years to get retested and I've been diagnosed with the same diagnosis in the last 20+ years. The testing is a pain in the ass; my last one (on my birthday no less) was nearly four hours long. Spending 10 minutes on google because you were up til 4AM ergo you have mania and therefore are bipolar underminds all the work that advocates do to destigmatize mental health. There is nothing sexy or cool about getting a total of 10 hours of sleep over a 7 day stretch because you're so manic or rearranging your apartment at 2AM, again also due to mania, and you'll probably rearrange it again later on in the week. There is nothing romantic about a psychotropic drug triggering your anxiety about driving on the highway that you honestly believe with all your heart your car will slide under a semi and you'll get decapitated. any time you get on the highway. (I hate you Wellbutrin.)  


(As an aside: I would caution about disclosing your mental illness for job applications. Yes, I know mental health is protected against discrimination but being open about my diagnosis to my leaders in the past has caused me a lot of problems to the point for one, I had to finish out my contract and not reapply because of the toxic work environment. And when you work in a very specialized industry (I am an academic librarian), finding a job can be quite difficult. Just be careful.)"
mentalillness,fcvymz9,t1_fcvwloo,1578013088.0,The problem with this is that so many disorders have similar symptoms that it takes a trained professional to dig out EXACTLY what diagnosis it is due to all the nuance. Seeking a diagnosis because you firmly believe due to your googling you have X is a romanticizing of mental illness.  I have ADHD and my manifestation does not include hyperactivity which is what most people assume IS only ADHD.

I was a network engineer for a telecom when 9/11 happened and I remember coming into the office and people were crowding around the breakroom TV watching the towers get hit. The company I worked for's office was located by Dulles and the largest internet exchange point, Mae-East, that handled the backbone for the east coast was down the road from us. There was a big fear that terrorists could take out that hub and knock out internet connectivity up and down the coast as well with our connections overseas. Security around those buildings were amped. Our building, and other buildings in the area which were all tech, were evacuated. My fiance worked for the company next door, so I picked him up and we stopped at a party store on the way home to grab booze and cigarettes. Cell towers were down / overloaded and lots of things such as credit card machines and any other communicative electronics were also down/overloaded. The poor clerk had a line out the door of people with the same thought and was handwriting cc numbers. That day and the coming days were a hella of a lot scarier than Y2K.  


So, yes, the '00s. Fiance and I broke up in 2002 and I moved back to my home state to finish my undergrad. Went on to obtain two master's after with the final graduation in 2010. I spent most of the '00s financially poor as I was constantly in school, however, one of my favorite jobs was working at a bookstore for $9.50/hr while I was in school. I was still heavily listening to music and going to shows. Fell in love a few times. Lived on my own for the first time. Got my own Netflix account in 2002 as well as my own TiVo. (Ex-fiance and I shared both while we were together from '99-'02). High Fidelity and Bridget Jones' Diary pretty much explained and defined my life. My love of Jane Austen got magnified ten fold with the '05 version of ""Pride & Prejudice."" Shows like Pushing Daisies, Spaced, Veronica Mars, and BSG remain my favorites to this day. A lot of ""The"" bands (The Killers, The Editors, etc). Started getting regular tattoos in '02 or '03 and I'm up to over 20 now. 

  
Upon reflection, '00s was a long decade of personal growth. Even with 9/11 and the housing and tech bust in '08 didn't seem as scary because we would eventually recover and move on as there is always hope. Our generation was primarily the inventors and prophets of the internet as we know it today so we adapted easily with the changing technologies while our parents, not so much. I got my first cell phone in '98ish and was a damned Nokia brick but people weren't really coordinating with text and social media (as we know it) until the mid-end of the '00s so it was regular for people to make plans ahead of time and just show up. Or just stop by someone's house because you were in the neighborhood. Try this now and someone is going to call the police for stalking. I started online dating in the late '90s where, ""omg, you're going to get murdered and dismembered"" and now we get into the back of cars driven by strangers with nary a second thought."

The reason why the nitpicking drives me insane is that I used to *be* that asshole who couldn't/wouldn't find a constructive way to participate in a conversation unless I was policing grammar and spelling.  ""Har har. You're an idiot because you don't know how to use a comma."" When I started training to tutor ESL students, it dawned on me that I have no idea if the person I'm policing online doesn't speak English as a first language, or has a learning disability, or a myriad of other reasons why their conversational skills may not be what native English speaker decides what they should be. The rigidity of grammar is so relaxed now as our communication styles are now so relaxed thanks to text speak and shorthand communication styles.

I did participate in DBT group sessions and that was helpful for a bit but I see that's not financially feasible. If your therapist is working with you on keeping things on track, that's wonderful.

My therapist recommends I use [binaural beats](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30073406). The link takes you to a literature review of past studies and it is shown that some get relief from anxiety listening to binaural beats. The one I like is by Tony Tueni on Insight Timer, ""Anxiety & Stress Reduction: Binaural beats Meditation."" I sometimes listen while I'm going to sleep. 

I really love [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) for meditation. Andy's voice is soothing and they've really amped up their available packs. 

I really want to stress that once you find the self-soothing techniques that work for you, use them as often as you can so that they become second nature. I also found writing to be really helpful to help determine triggers and self-soothing techniques. Be mindful of creating obsessions (wich for BPD people is VERY easy to do).
