Dudes crazy though but combat wears you out ten times faster than you normally would never mind all the weight your carrying.  That adrenaline can be your friend in the short term or the enemy in the long term.  I remember my HM2 telling me about an ambush he was in Fallujah.  He said he will never forget running so fast to find cover  during an ambush clearing In the second battle of Fallujah.  He said he was running and literally out of breath and saying how hard it was to run just a few hundred more yards to cover.  If you are ever on Pendleton they have a wall memorial in camp porno or near it with the 89 names from the 5th marine regiments."
CombatFootage,fgm065c,t3_eyvzva,1580915163.0,I hope those things have good AC.   I bet it could get really hot really fast.
politics,fglzxzi,t3_ez8abt,1580915014.0,I hope Bernie gets the nomination.  I’m a moderate but lean Republican and I would love for Bernie to stick it to the system.  I might just even vote for him because this country really needs to see some change and I feel Bernie is the only one who can do it.  I’m not big on the socialist ideas but it doesn’t seem that bad compared to the current political climate.  I think some socialist policies are less of a risk compared to the current political path this country is currently on.
politics,fgibvod,t1_fgibpis,1580815958.0,"Not at all.  The midwesterners don’t suck, the DNC does and is rigged and corrupt and has two elections in a row now tried to rig it in the favor of their candidate to screw Sanders.  I’m not even a Bernie supporter but the corruption from the DNC two years in a row now to manipulate the results in the favor of their favored candidate aka Biden."
politics,fgiboqa,t3_eykzfj,1580815710.0,Headline should read Sanders wins Biden loses but the DNC is so beyond corrupt and so fixated on Biden as their pick they have literally rigged their selection again to screw Sanders.  That’s two elections in a row now and the democrats are supposedly the better party according to this sub and the Republicans are evil.  I absolutely love this.  Eat shit r/politics

HadToHurt,fffy1sw,t3_etb8uj,1579894296.0,I got stung by a Portuguese man-o-war and omg it’s pretty pain.  Feels like growing pains and a bunch of papers wasps stinging you.  Urine helped alleviate slightly.

AskMen,ff5zzqs,t3_erlbbu,1579615569.0,I went to pick up a girl in high school.  I get to the door and knock.  All I hear is a dog barking and he sounded big.  Her mom opened the glass door to tell me she would be down in a second.  While she is telling me this she’s struggling to hold back their Giant German Shepard. Before she even finishes her sentence this dog busts out stands on his hind legs trying to bite me in the face.  Her mom is freaking out and then her Dad comes running from the backyard and saves me.  My boy and his girl are laughing their asses off.  The dog didn’t injure me.  He bit my arm but didn’t break skin.  He could have bit me a lot harder but didn’t.  I thought I was going to die from how aggressively he was trying to get out the door to get me.  Her dad took the dog out back and I heard some yelping.  I kind of felt bad and like it was my fault lol.

The body’s 420420 but that engine is nowhere near that, I can guarantee. I just got a cheap ass boss who doesn’t want to even buy a single new sweeper truck."

CasualUK,fejs0x9,t3_epgsah,1579184419.0,He was probably following a priest around.
UFOs,fejq5c3,t3_epgn80,1579183004.0,My big thing is this.  If someone is in control of these drones and has done it multiple times why not admit to it?  No laws have been broken according to experts.  Another thing is if it’s not drones then the military would be all over it.  It would be a subject of national security and would definitely have the militaries attention.  It doesn’t seem to have their attention or at least publicly.  I’m surprised no planes or helicopters have been dispatched to intercept them unless someone knows more about their possible mundane purpose.  I guess only time will tell and the truth revealed.
CombatFootage,fegusz7,t3_ep1pmh,1579103016.0,A-10s were mostly responsible for the highway of death.  I was in Kuwait in 2010 and a lot of those vehicles and military equipment on still on the side of the road.
