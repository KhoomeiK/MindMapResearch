restofthefuckingowl,feivhte,t1_feikuxl,1579148332.0,"I actually like these most of the time over individual pictures per piece

More convenient as there isn’t as much page turning, and I can see everything I need to find it all at once or in groups, instead of assemble a piece, flip page, get piece, assemble and so on

I also like building things to begin with, that’s just how I work"

Edit: at max operable speed, the tips can reach 180 mph 

They only get 10-20 rpm at the shaft though, but 150 foot blades will produce insane tip velocities"

No, actually where I grew up it gets hotter than it does here. Gets less rain, more heat, and less winter. Ever heard of Death Valley? Yea, that’s in California.

‘California is great because winter doesn’t really exist’

Ever been to the northern parts? Snows there. A lot.

People don’t realize that California has one of the most varied climates out of the other states, Arizona is also one of those, as I just learned. Runs pretty far north to south."
