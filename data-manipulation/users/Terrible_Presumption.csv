If its one thing I want to share with you it's this:

People are literally the dumbest things on Earth. We mostly learn by copying what other things/species do to survive. We practice and repeat what we see as being normal until it becomes second nature. All of this technology and use of industry to make things great comes to us at little cost or effort without regard of other peoples risk, effort, and cost. Most people just sit around like a pair of testicles in a sack looking for more things to sit-on while waiting for even more easier things to come around.

We are also generally social animals, we flourish in complete chaos as a group following the same rule of just going through motions and repeating what was once done before without any risk or effort upon ourselves until something easy comes about. 

I see many people on a daily basis that can't figure out the simple things on their own, but will never let down the chance to point at a silly mistake that isn't there's. This excitement makes the group socially respond and makes the person's brain reward themselves with endorphins, adrenaline, and other chaotic body nutrients mostly resulting in a smile and being louder... When your quiet, not responding, and ultimately not allowing that character his or her reward you're the weird one.

If the federal law changes and opens the debate of Universal Health Care our Affordable Care Act could remove mandates for employers to compete with health insurance packages and allow business other incentives options employees actually want, right?
