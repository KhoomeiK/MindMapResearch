Cheers!"
AskReddit,ffg37zx,t1_ffferdj,1579897488.0,"Yeah, well said! I tried, but it sounds lame even to myself - we had free healthcare and are complaining about the fucking jeans... but it's really hard to explain to someone who didn't live there, you're right, it's like to explain another civilization (or planet)."
AskReddit,fffkdwi,t1_fff2ghd,1579885856.0,"Yeah, it may be different. I'm from Lvov, where a life wasn't very Soviet to begin with... and I'm sure the mindset was very different."
AskReddit,fff9zv1,t1_ffey59l,1579879340.0,"On the ship with American crew? Definitely there has to be KGB officer (who's of course also a party member), because it's a matter of national security... it's not unusual, there was one in every group of tourists travelling abroad (not that there were many), and a scientific expedition with close contacts with foreigners is another level entirely."
AskReddit,fff3p22,t1_ffewtkg,1579874865.0,"Levi's jeans cost more than *a month's salary* on black market. The situation with clothes and necessities was really one of the most insane things in Soviet Union: the ""imported"" (i.e. made abroad, because not many things were officially imported) things were kind of cult and represented your status like nothing else. I'm not talking designer clothes, mostly regular stuff like jeans and sneakers, nice shampoo or perfume, and dont even start about the most coveted item - bubble gum... The Soviet clothes weren't just ugly - they were humiliating, I can't even describe how much, it's like someone intentionally designed them to make you cry. It may sound absurd to people who grew up in the West: we had so many important things for free, like healthcare and education, long vacations every year etc., but fuck, being surrounded by ugly things and a lack of toilet paper in the stores (plenty of writing paper, btw) may make your life really miserable. It's hard to explain, but our life felt very... undignified because of all this."
AskReddit,fff22vm,t1_ffef8nl,1579873590.0,"I was a kid at Brezhnev times, and back then no one believed shit already. Also, there was no equality in reality, there were rich and entitled people and poor people, as everywhere. Your wealth wasn't always expressed in cash money, but people massively traded connections, privileges and goods. I never met a person who believed that a Soviet system was good, except my great aunt who was a party functionary and had lots of privileges unavailable to mere mortals."

AskReddit,ffbr8wu,t1_ffbdwgp,1579779577.0,"I live in Israel , and here too so many products have a huge  amounts of salt, even the meat is salty already, because of the koshering process - so I thought if I'll exclude all the added salt, I'll still have enough. I knew about electrolytes (had a low Na and K once because of too much diuretics, almost fainted), but I believed I'll be very far from that since I still eat yellow cheese, meat etc. As you can imagine, in the Middle East we have a huge selection of spices, extra virgin olive oil, etc, etc, so I hardly felt the lack of salt taste-wise, and I got used to it: when I last went to a restaurant with friends, the food felt oversalted for me, and my friends didn't feel it at all, so my taste just changed. Now the problem is that I don't want the salt back in my food, so I believe my solution (no pun intended) should be a bloody Mary.... :)"

Low sodium. I don't have a problem with the taste, btw, since I use lots of spices, lemon juice and whatnot, so my food is never bland, but it some amount of salt is still necessary, and apparently teaspoon a day is not only the maximum amount, but also a recommended one (it includes the salt found in different foods).

So even a ""diagnosis"" is wrong, if it made you see that something is prpblematic here - it's enough.
