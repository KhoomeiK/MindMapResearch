if you think you can live with the secret it’s definitely an option to not say anything, i just reaaaaally don’t recommend it cos it tends to come out eventually and blow up. i will say tho if you do this option u are gonna wanna make sure you really learn from what happened and don’t repeat that.

unfortunately i just think your ex likes knowing that he can still catch your attention.

also my friend suggested that i keep myself accountable for the bare minimum: showering, eating, hydration, etc. it will slowly become easier.

do u have hobbies? if u can throw yourself into something productive that’s ideal.

it sounds like he unfortunately is either not attracted to you or figuring out what he likes, sexually. i think you guys need to have a heart-to-heart about where you will move forward from this.

like clearly you don’t take issue with the fact he a) watches porn nor b) is attracted to trans women.
butttttt you’re in the right to be hurt and insecure. if he wants to be with a trans woman but doesn’t know how, he can’t just keep you around.

this is your call but it sounds to me like whatever flame was there may be gone for him.

anyway seriously tho im glad that you told him he shouldn’t be embarrassed. at this point you’ve set the stage for him to be honest and whether or not he does is his call"

your ex does not respect you, your relationship, or his. you NEED to make a decision.

if you’re not gonna tell your boyfriend then PLEASE do yourselves a favor and BREAK UP. it will kill him if he just finds out by chance and i guarantee you he’ll never trust you again (which is your fault).

you can’t have it both ways. go be your ex’s side girl or be a good and honest GF to your man. sorry for being harsh but i think u need to hear this cos clearly u ain’t telling the truth to yourself"
