...no, wait, that sounds like 1/5th of the current psvr market, which is pitifully small compared to the general ps4, xbox one, or switch markets, and mainly attracts indie studios making relatively small, lower-budget, cross-platform titles and the occasional port of an existing game from a big studio testing the waters.

Love how you pick red dead 2 as an example, it being one of the most expensive games ever made. *Nobody* is gonna spend that kind of money making any VR game until the deployed unit numbers are vastly higher than they are now. Not even Sony themselves.

It's one thing to gamble a high-budget title on a new system like PS5, when it's a given that Sony will keep supporting the system and it will eventually likely move 100,000,000 units or more. Gambling that on VR, which across *all* headsets hasn't come *close* to that number of units sold would be hugely risky for any game studio."

With an odd, higher-order cube, you can do a superflip by just applying a regular 3x3 superflip alg treating it as a 3x3 turning only the outermost layers, then again with the 2 outermost layers together, and so on until you're turning all layers except the middle slice.

AFAIK there's not really a megaminx superflip algorithm - whole-puzzle megaminx notation is certainly possible but afaik not really standardized or widely used the way cube notations are  - but you can still treat it applying a series of megaminx superflips, in this case three times, same as doing a 7x7 cube. Not used this to do a superflip on my gigaminx (don't even own a petaminx!), but it's the approach I take to doing a checkerboard and other similar patterns on it, and it certainly takes me a lot less time than fully solving even to a true solved state, much less to a pattern that's always more confusing!"

If Tris has *really* learned from her experiences, she'll be anticipating the obvious follow-on problems, rather than just dismissing Lanora as beneath concern. Not sure what she could do at this point, and not sure how Lanora would react to Tris even *trying* to help, but in some form or other, Tris ought to at least make the attempt in the immediate aftermath of this scene. No end of people she could potentially introduce her to, though none of them are likely to thank Tris for it, and Lanora at least *might* be receptive to Tris' advice at this point.

Usually the ire was focused on American companies like Apple, who were happy to take advantage of how fucked up China was for their own profit, and Google, who were happy to help the Chinese government suveil and censor it's people if the job came with a big enough check, but that's still ultimately anti-China."

Sony's unique Eye-sensing Light Field Display uses high-speed vision sensors and face recognition algorithms to enable super high precision spatial reality experience not found in conventional naked-eye 3D displays. It can be easily applied to VR (virtual reality) and AR (augmented reality) content, providing a versatile volumetric content creation environment to creators in various fields such as entertainment and product design.

You've got a white center-corner lined up on Front such that turning that rightmost wing slice clockwise will put it where there's an orange on the top now. Do that.

Next, turn the top counter-clockwise. This will place it so that an orange center-corner on the front can be put into the same spot by doing a counter-clockwise turn of the left wing slice. Do that one too.

Now turn the top back to the original position, and reverse the right wing slice turn.

Turn top ccw again and reverse the left wing slice turn.

Congratulations! You've fixed one of the four pairs! You'll have to figure out the set-up for the others, but this basic process will work for all of them. Play around with it, there's ways you can sometimes swap multiple pieces at once. 

A footnote, this isn't actually swapping two pieces - it's rotating three pieces, in the walkthroug example above two orange and one white."
