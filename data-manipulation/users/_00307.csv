Going 29mph and losing your balance is not in the same ball park as going 29 and hitting something that immediately stops your board.  
  
A downhill skater has fallen so many times, and is so low to the ground, the energy turns into sliding, and the course is lined with a softish barrier.  
   
In an urban setting, there are many more obstacles, dangers, and small things that put you down in various ways.

even protonmail says the 4 word system is purely for your memory, and that:

For example, a 20-character password consisting of random lower-case letters is much stronger than a four-word passphrase composed of common words. Such a password cannot be dictionary attacked, so it must be brute-forced, which would take modern computers billions of years to do.""  
  
my point is, by being common words, you sacrifice true security for convenience. Im not saying its bad, by in large, if most people switched to a 4 word system, the internet would be more secure. But as a whole, dictionary attacks are much much faster than brute/entropy based attacks"

LifeProTips,fe6a7pg,t1_fe64vwn,1578885272.0,"The most secure password from an end user perspective is a pass phrase or long password containing only random characters,  not limited by capitalization character count or which special characters.  
   
A 4 word passphrase using complete english words is less ""secure"" than 12 random characters/numbers/letters.   
  
Some to do with bits of entropy, other to do with how security tools work."
LifeProTips,fe69vs9,t1_fe5vbix,1578885036.0,dictionary attacks do not need to do all that. Not modern day ones  at least.
LifeProTips,fe69ufg,t1_fe5oyi0,1578885009.0,The actually randompart is key. Not just my example. It can exponentially add bits to the password strength than using plain english words.
LifeProTips,fe69r0e,t1_fe5pomh,1578884942.0,"Yea, that's not how modern day dictionary attacks work."
LifeProTips,fe58br4,t1_fe4zpyz,1578866533.0,"That is not how all dictionary attacks work.   
  
If you use a real 4 word passphrase, with brute available, it would take less than 10 minutes.   
  
That is why they suggest just swapping for  numbers (o for 0) in places. It, mostly, defeats the majority of dictionary and dictionary style attacks.
