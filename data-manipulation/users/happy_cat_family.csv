The mobile version doesn’t have the latest update yet (coming soon), or mods like the PC version, but it’s relaxing to be able to pick it up and play it anywhere.

If you don’t like using taps to navigate on mobile (or the on screen joystick) you can pair a controller with your phone to play (I use a spare PS4 one through Bluetooth). There are a lot of controller options for mobile so you can customise it easily to how you prefer to play."

How far you can cast out the line is tied to your fishing level.

StardewValley,fe6kq2l,t3_enzted,1578894119.0,"There’s nothing wrong with that. The great thing about Stardew Valley is that you can play how you want. 

I personally spend a good amount of Spring on the farm clearing, planting and watering and then venture off do other activities like fishing, mining, and talking to the NPCs when I want a change in pace. I’ve got more than one save slot, so I’ve been experimenting with how I want to play on the others.

There are also some cool farm layouts and ideas that people have shared here so I’m keen to give some of them a try as well.

If you are new to the game, don’t worry too much about optimising your game play. If you miss trying something (and it is tied to a season), you’ll get another opportunity when the season comes back around."

MonsterHunterWorld,fe16ygt,t3_enlnma,1578823220.0,"The Guiding Lands is a combination of the different map areas (Ancient Forest, Wildspire Waste etc). Monsters will spawn in related to those areas (and leave if you don’t engage them) but the monsters that spawn depend on what level each area is. 

Very simplistically, you can control what spawns (or what you want to fight) based on how you level up the regions. After you remove the cap, you can’t have all regions at max - some will drop in level as you raise others. 

There’s a bit to the mechanics of raising the guiding lands as you can bring monsters across into different regions in the guiding lands (think one big island with distinctive area boundaries), and in general the etiquette about hunting the target monster the host specifies in multiplayer due to how it levels up the guiding lands. 

The resource drops are better (can collect at camp after each hunt) and you can get extra resources for layered armor. If you collect tracks you can get lures to force the spawning of a monster that you want to go after."

If you check on Shane’s profile in your menu (where it shows the hearts) it will also show what items you have been giving and how Shane feels about them.

If you get animals on your farm, selling the crafted materials (mayonnaise etc) is a good daily income. Additionally, if you plant lots of crops you’ll find you want to sell a lot of them for more income if you don’t have a way to process them (turn into jelly/pickles/wine etc). After your farm is more established you might be shipping the crafting products, rather than the raw crops.
