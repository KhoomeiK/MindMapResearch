Its basically buying another console for what is essentially a gimmick. Enthusiasts, the guys with decent incomes who are following the industry, are the main drivers of it and the industry in general is tailoring more to them (see: whales in F2P games), but hardware isnt sustainable in the same way microtransactions are. You can have hundreds of players who never spend a dime for every person spending a couple hundred and still have a successful game community, but when *everyone* has to drop a few hundred, that isnt feasible."

AskReddit,ffcbhdp,t1_ffc3dvh,1579795849.0,"Tbh writing well (as a student) is a subtler skill than most people really appreciate, and a lot of it comes down to prose. Read enough 101 level papers and it becomes clear why. 

Every sentence follows a basic format. Grammar is really simple. It is also very repetitive. You get very bored reading it.

Honestly, Id say posting in general has helped me with this. The bigger concepts like framing and argumentative structure get covered in composition classes, but its been here that ive developed a rhythm to my sentence structure. Id guess its from so much practice carrying a conversational tone and stuff. Makes all the other stuff come across better, as well, since any point trying to be made isnt lost through the effort of trudgin through all the boring sentences.

Granted, I like writing, but Ive seen a lot of people who dont end up in yr situation. Not a bad one to be in, obviously, but probably indicates that theres a growing gap between people who use a lot of social media and those who dont more than it does a newfound passion for writing among millenials."

I consider it nihilistic because it requires rejecting any sort of community or interest in a broader human project. If youre going to declare capitalism as the apotheosis of political economy, youre saying poverty or any other inherent issues with it are the best we can do. Or, youre saying theyre innate to how people live and organize, and i think that invokes essentialism in a dangerous way.

Egotism here meaning that the belief that a few oligarchs should control the economy implies capital ownership corresponds with the prudence for its efficient use, which i disagree with.
