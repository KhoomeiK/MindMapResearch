AnimalsBeingBros,ffiun2o,t1_ffiruj1,1579983146.0,"My apartment building is non-smoking, even on the balconies, so you have to go outside across the street to smoke. People like to get around this by smoking on the building's loading dock...which is one floor directly below my apartment. When someone's smoking there, I can smell it even with the windows closed.

Is it my fault for being close to the second hand smoke while minding my own business? Where do you recommend I go if I can't even get away from second-hand smoke in my own home?

I don't feel like it's asking too much for smokers to just take some responsibility for where they indulge their habit."

Frisson,ffi8tpm,t1_ffhmn3y,1579968053.0,"I'm not sure that's a fair question. A lot of that depends on the performers. I think André Rieu could play Row, Row, Row Your Boat and still move the audience to tears.

Besides, ""good"" is a matter of taste. I go to the Minnesota Orchestra occasionally, and they like to play modern pieces, which I'm sure are technically impressive but which I usually find boring and uncomfortably dissonant."

That said, I do understand that sometimes you get what you pay for; it's the instances of buying the costlier version for the sake of it being costlier that I can't seem to reconcile the way he does.

Does one have to wait until it gets violent? If an adult created a listing for a black person as a slave for sale, would we write it off as ""nonviolent bullying"" or deal with it as a hate crime?

I'm not saying the kid ought to be put away for life, but I also don't think it's bad to impress on him that racist actions have consequences."
MadeMeSmile,ffaibqb,t1_ffafuxl,1579736410.0,"You're right, that wasn't entirely fair, and I shouldn't have left it at that, sorry. I was not trying to move goalposts. (Although the sentiment remains. Imo, any reason for locking people up in camps is a terrible reason.)

That said, the refugee status and the skin color aren't unrelated. If Australians had to start fleeing their country because of the fires, do you think we'd be locking them up in inhumane conditions, too? If Brexit suddenly went (further) south and the Brits started fleeing political turmoil, would we stick them in camps? There's only one way to know for sure, but I sincerely doubt it.

It's hard to pretend we're not detaining people based on race when we have governing officials publicly calling Latinxs animals and calling nonwhite countries shitholes and arresting US citizens for illegal immigration because they fit a racial profile. The method of immigration is just an excuse."
MadeMeSmile,ffafnpc,t1_ffa3um9,1579734637.0,"As far as I'm concerned, that's an even worse reason to lock them up, considering they're mostly refugees fleeing political turmoil, and being a refugee is not a form of illegal immigration."
MadeMeSmile,ffadvek,t1_ff9vegy,1579733266.0,"Lol, you can fixate on the Nazi bit and ignore the rest of the definition if you want (or even ignore the fact that you weren't mad about someone using the phrase to describe China's camps?), and I can't stop you. And hey, next time you jump down someone's throat for misusing the word ""literal,"" maybe see if they're actually misusing it first. Or not. You do you!"
MadeMeSmile,ff9tge5,t1_ff9skwl,1579720893.0,"Perhaps I should have specified, because sometimes Latinx or Hispanic people are classified as white. You never see any illegal European immigrants in camps.

According to Pew, as of last year (there's no data yet this year, I assume) there are actually fewer illegal Latinx immigrants than there are illegal Asian immigrants, but for some weird reason it's just the Central and South Americans that people want to lock up on a massive scale. It's just the Latinx immigrants that conservatives are whipping people into a frenzy about. 

Why do you think that might be?"
MadeMeSmile,ff9s778,t1_ff8zbaz,1579720054.0,"Yes, that is one way in which the term is used! Congrats, your reading comprehension is above abysmal. However, you may also have noted that it is not used ONLY in reference to Nazi camps.

But yes, you digress. Please feel free go back to telling me how the literal definition isn't the literal definition."
MadeMeSmile,ff9s27c,t1_ff81wue,1579719953.0,Interesting. I never see any white illegal immigrants arrested and stuck in camps.
