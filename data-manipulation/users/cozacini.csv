I'm not saying rationality is some absolute something, dont get me wrong

> Therefore shaping your whole world view on an idea you see as 'most rational' is a losing bet. 

why? i can see some action as rational but not do it because of emotions, but that doesn't mean that that action iss rational. and if living according to rationality is loss then what is the win? 

> You saying 'nothing matters' as if that is actually some divine revelation and not just your way of coping with the burden of self-responsibility is a waste of time because you'll continue to go through life with things mattering to you.

Partly agree, I don't know what current events you precisely refer to, but I believe there are (possibly many) scenarios when that yelling at people with your arguments is perfectly justified, namely, when you are right and it's not a subject for debate. 

Example: Some dumbfuck says that there is no global warming, at first you explain to him, link articles and studies and whatnot, but he says that it is all bullshit, scientists lie and he thinks he possesses god level intellect for not falling for propaganda like you do and he has ""haha I'm gonna burn some rubber haha fuk u greta ;--DDD"", at this point your mental goes boom, you just yell at that idiot because you won't just politely go away while his actions poisons the entire globe. 

Another perfect example is people who believe in god(taking god of the bible as an example here). There is no way their belief is rational and makes sense, many will even admit that by saying ""you know that is what faith is about"". And it would be all gucci but they enforce their beliefs on others. They will tell you that you can't do something because THEIR religion forbids. You prove him wrong but he still will enforce his bullshit on others, you get infuriated by that and it's perfectly justified."
