AnimalCrossing,ffjw177,t3_eu19jz,1580008495.0,How?
Showerthoughts,ffjm1wn,t3_etzrp3,1580001364.0,Mine are in an old coke bottle.
Sims4,ffjlywe,t3_etzrwr,1580001307.0,I don't think the websites check. Choose based on the number of downloads and the modders reputation or look through the code yourself.
gaming,ffhet93,t1_ffgoi4r,1579932283.0,Makes sense.  I never would have thought if it because I hate the texture of dry toothpaste.
gaming,ffgodk2,t3_etj1re,1579910976.0,Have you tried deodorant on your palms?
TrollCoping,ffgfao3,t3_dhhgzb,1579904942.0,"When someone asks ""How are you?"", I always say ""Fine"" because etiquette classes have drilled that into me. When a customer asked me ""How's it going?"" I replied ""Ha ha. What are you getting?"""
TrollCoping,ffge0k3,t3_e7qd6z,1579904136.0,"On the day I was closing a store by myself, a guy came in talking about how he was desperate for money but not desperate enough to sell his gun. I kept hoping no one would walk in so I could tell him no when he tried to rob me."
dankmemes,ffgdmd9,t1_fc5pgce,1579903892.0,The fee for adopting an adult dog from the shelter isn't much. I'm thinking $35-$100. If you want a puppy it may be $150-$250.
TrollCoping,fffyahm,t1_fdbdotm,1579894447.0,It should be the correct answer. I have been threatened with involuntary hospitalization for not wanting to address my otc abuse. I don't know if they would have followed through but that person knows I can't afford a lawyer if they choose to violate my rights. They probably know I couldn't afford to keep seeing them if they committed me.
Showerthoughts,fffwud8,t3_etepma,1579893547.0,They new they would be dead in 90 years so it wouldn't affect them.
AnimalCrossing,fffwr35,t3_eteptf,1579893489.0,"Nintendo likes to announce these things as late as possible. Animal Crossing on the DS got special edition consoles, so we may get a new horizon switch or lite, but it may not be announced until 2 weeks out."
Showerthoughts,fffvzlz,t3_etevh3,1579893007.0,"We have no idea what it would sound like, but maybe they didn't either. There's a chance we've come really close on accident."
thesims,fffozd9,t1_fffog8l,1579888659.0,I mean it would be a coding challenge. It took a team of professionals weeks after the release of seasons to make it stop raining indoors. This is the same idea.
thesims,fffnqq2,t1_fffmv5v,1579887906.0,"When you give players the freedom to make rooms with any number of walls and make floors and ceilings optional, it becomes really hard to define a room to apply that rule to."
streetwear,ffe10up,t3_et410b,1579833916.0,There's nothing wrong with not shitting on kids
books,ffdabgf,t3_et016c,1579816545.0,"I don't know if knowing the story can ruin your enjoyment. Everyone knows Shakespeare, but we still enjoy retellings."
depression,ffda35y,t3_et01ju,1579816408.0,I think people many people that are depressed also have a high iq. I haven't read anything that suggests causality.
Showerthoughts,ffd0qzu,t1_ffd0iro,1579811145.0,Not a clue. I get hating bad truck drivers but not more than bad car drivers.
Showerthoughts,ffcjvfg,t3_eswbd0,1579801012.0,"People think intimacy with family members is a given, but it's not and you both need to put forth the effort to communicate. I have a friend that likes long conversations about feelings. I don't like that. The compromise is she talks to me while I'm on my phone or playing a game. I'm still listening and I occasionally show her relevant memes."
Showerthoughts,ffc0z1p,t3_estkag,1579788756.0,We have cars because running long distances requires years of training or we will hurt ourselves and walking is too slow.
GirlGamers,ffa4gme,t3_esi520,1579727695.0,A horse sim that draws inspiration from RDR2 would be amazing. GTA 6 can wait
Showerthoughts,ffa4191,t3_esi5rl,1579727454.0,Who are these people?
Showerthoughts,ff9e916,t1_ff9d4t7,1579711121.0,People had chairs and appliances at home. And also clothelines.
Showerthoughts,ff9co3i,t1_ff9camp,1579710014.0,Desk jobs existed before computers. They had pen and paper.
Showerthoughts,ff9c539,t1_ff8xygn,1579709615.0,They had chairs in the 50s
depression,ff64l6r,t1_ff63ijp,1579618981.0,Thanks
depression,ff62oeo,t1_ff6206n,1579617610.0,Fear is one of the emotions I can still feel. Pride is not.
LifeProTips,ff5y39c,t3_er7w4i,1579614003.0,I thought this was a default setting. I've edited lots of emails after hitting send.
LifeProTips,ff5xk3m,t1_ff5n9vd,1579613546.0,"Because no one can touch my butt without me being aware and immediately reacting and a stolen wallet is only a mild inconvenience. I never have cash, cards can be frozen, and you can pay for stuff with your phone. 


A stolen phone is a big deal, so I usually carry it in my hand."
buildapc,ff5v5ue,t3_eru1q2,1579611344.0,Wireless headsets cost a lot more than wired headsets of the same quality because wireless has to deal with latency. You can get a better quality wired headset for the same price or less.
depression,ff5dfb4,t1_ff4mp7b,1579588253.0,I don't really buy that either because I've tried it. I got up early to workout and avoid failing gym. I walked everywhere because I didn't know the bus system and driving wasn't an option. I ate healthy because I was afraid someone would judge me if they saw me eating junk in the dining hall. I even went to bed early to avoid pissing off my roommate. It was still one of the darkest times in my life.
Sims4,ff4wdds,t1_ff4w966,1579574034.0,"Yes. With autonomy completely off, they just stand still after completing a task. With autonomy on, they will queue their own tasks."
