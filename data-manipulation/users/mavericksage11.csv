Although, humalog's patent of Eli Lilly has started to expire.

Edit: It's incredibly hard for any new comers to compete with big pharmaceutical companies. 
95% of the world's insulin is supplied by just 3 companies. Eli Lilly, Novonordisk and Sanofi.
Insulin market is riddled with Patents, heavy cost.

And also, when the patent expires other companies develope exact copies of the original drug because it's easier. When it comes to insulin, it's impossible to produce exact copies. So it's harder to get it approved by the FDA. For biologics they call something called, biosimilars which gets far less approved by the FDA compared to other generics."

Maintain a proper posture always. If you have developed a bad posture over time, find some exercises that you can do to help the situation. 

You may try a posture corrector if you want. Don't wear it always, because your body will get used to it and you'll never make a conscious effort to maintain the posture. Wear it occasionally, take it off and then try to do it yourself. It'll be hard at first but you'll find out that you're comfortable like this and that back pains have gone null.
