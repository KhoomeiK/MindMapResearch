TumblrInAction,fdtj19r,t1_fdqnrs3,1578717461.0,"To be fair, could YOU move around 5 tons of attached fat? I'd say that's pretty disabled... Granted they COULD lose weight, but with all the retarded ""Fat is Healthy"" bullshit on tumblr, and all the misinformation going around about weight loss and health, then, if their brain is easily moved by such things, then they are pretty much screwed in terms of losing weight.  
  
I get it, unlike being born without legs or something like that, they HAVE a way out of their disability, but you also have to take the brain into consideration, most likely it and other factors are leading them to believe that that don't need to lose weight, or that it won't be possible, or w/e.  
  
This means that, in a way they aren't in a position to even be able to consider losing weight, since their brainwashed brains gives them easier alternatives to feeling better, like consuming carbs and whatnot, which the brain REALLY likes, despite it being unhealthy in our current environment, since the brain is programmed to be in the wild with no guaranteed source of energy, meaning that we should consume EVERYTHING we can, ESPECIALLY the very high energy containing carbs, which could let your store extra fat so you can survive a bit longer without food when you inevitably can't find any.  
  
Of course, we have farms now, so, at least in first world countries, actually dying of starvation(not to be confused with malnutrition) is very hard, since high energy foods are so easily available.  
  
All in all, there's no good solution to this, any I can think of would violate some kind of human right or basic decency, hopefully we can soon find a way to help these people that are essentially slaves to their own brain."
