I've seen a couple of monthly services by grocery stores since and they seem like great deals.  My preferred grocery store will shop for me, bring it out to my car and load it in the trunk for $2 so that is what I use right now.

Instacart is more expensive but you can get stuff from almost any store, so that is nice."

A lot of cancer organizations do offer finical help for ""bills and other expenses"" from treatment and which would probably help with those costs but I thankfully never had to apply for those."

aww,fdrxuey,t1_fdrvs17,1578691340.0,"Also you just have to pay for talent, and non profits are some of the hardest businesses to run properly.  A big part of the reason why CEOs get paid so much is that it isn't an easy job and not many people can do it (I know, unpopular reddit opinion).  Honestly having a CEO go from \~2 mil/year salary at a medium sized for profit corporation to only 500k for a HUGE non profit is a major pay cut.  Cut it anymore and you are never going to find someone good enough to properly run the company.

CEOs (and all the big wigs below them) make the organizations work well and make each dollar go farther."

While you are between jobs you should not be giving anyone money, let alone someone who is employed.  Your savings are am important safety net that you should be very careful with."
MomForAMinute,fc6rae2,t3_eggjl8,1577487473.0,"Take a deep breath dear.  It will be ok.

I will first tell you that it is likely something mild or easy to deal with.

I will also tell you that even if it is for the worst, you will be fine.  I've been there.  I just finished up my cancer treatment (I'm 33) while dealing with crippling anxiety.  Cancer sucks, but is highly treatable right now and there are many, many organizations out there to help walk you through it both mentally and financially.

When it comes to possible cancer, doctors DO NOT fuck around.  I had mine checked out when I was at my annual and I went in for the ultrasound/biopsy/testing that afternoon.  There are certain cancers that need to be dealt with immediately but they wont know until after the biopsy, so they treat everything urgently until it isn't.  Shit moves quick.

Feel free to PM me if you wanna talk any of this through at any stage of the process.  Either for advice/guidance or if you just need one one to bitch to about the situation.  You got this!"

Can you help him get on his feet a way other than financially?  Or else you might want to start adding conditions onto your gifts, like job searches or keeping a job.  I am not sure of why he is broke so I can't offer deeper options.  Just remember that there are more options between giving freely and cutting him off completely."
