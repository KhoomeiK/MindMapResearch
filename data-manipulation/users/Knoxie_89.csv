The Omni is an add-on? Can't seem to find that combo."

Filter is newish, put it in when i bought the house.

Florida too btw so 365 use.  I currently only need to (prob should more) clean the filter every 1-2 months. It stays pretty clean since the pool is in screened in.

Thanks for all the info though! Great place to start looking."

I expected a smaller pump as well, but thats whats there.

I just don't know whats really available is the issue. Googling this brings back so many results i dont know what to stay away from and what not."

golf,ffr79wo,t1_ffr6u4x,1580151994.0,"I dont like the 12 hole idea, keeping the 18 and just shortening most things up makes more sense to me. I can do a full 18 on the executives down here with 2-4 people in 3 hours. Some of the exectuives i can do solo w/ 2 people in under 2 if its empty.  

Plus you are still fresh enough that you can do another 9-18 if you want from different tees and change the whole course up.  Playing the whites vs blues on a few of the executives around here are like playing a different course all together."
golf,ffr10p0,t1_ffqyl8w,1580148091.0,"For sure. I think they just need to rethink their setup. Maybe it's just me but I wouldn't mind more par 3, executive, par 60 courses for municipal curses l courses.  They're easier to maintain, easier for people to play and learn on, and take up less space. You could cut an 18 6000 yard municipal course in half and double the holes. Obviously this would be an expense, but I think they would get better returns on it. Then use the other half of the old course for a park and other stuff. Maybe disk/foot golf where landscaping is less maintenance intensive."
