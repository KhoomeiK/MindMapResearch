depression,ff9wl7c,t3_esdz2o,1579723086.0,The only thing I'm good at is describing the myriad of ways that I'm entirely useless. The only good act I could take is offing myself.
depression,feubvuk,t1_feqrxp3,1579385086.0,"Nonsense. I workout constantly and watch my diet rigorously, yet this hasn't helped me in the slightest with social functioning. FOr a neurotypical, yes, this is good advice, but for the atypicals like myself? Nah son, we were fucked the day we were born. No amount of lifting can fix a genuinely, medically diagnosed malfunctioning brain. Only cure for that is to rope, since the cope sure isn't doing it."
silenthill,fegse4d,t1_fegr3gm,1579101438.0,"The issue with a remake introducing a new generation to the story is that said story will inevitably either be altered into something barely resembling the original, or be so similar it begs the question why remake it at all. On top of that, the numerous intricacies of the original will more than likely be lost in translation, which will further hamper what the original did. 

And it isn't naive to assume no one can do it, because simply put no one has. Can you earnestly name a single studio that has put out something in the same style to the same quality of the team silent SH games? Frankly, I can't, and the few names i've seen thrown around I find highly disagreeable. 

And frankly, REmake 2 isn't a good comparison here, as the real strength of RE as a series has always been first and foremost its gameplay. REmake 2 is so wildu different and well crafted that of course it worked, on top of having the existing pedigree of a RE1 remake. Silent Hill has always leaned more on its narrative and aesthetic qualities, with the gameplay acting as a vehicle to explore these. Not anywhere near as easy to remake, and I still don't see anyone who is up to the task."

silenthill,fegnbs5,t3_ep2fm6,1579097890.0,"I'd be 100% opposed to it. I don't see a reason to remake it, and additional elements like sub scenarios for other characters have the potential to muddy the tight themes of the the original. There's no real benefit to remaking it, and frankly I don't think any developer working today is up to the task of recreating the game. Silent Hill 2, and the classic games in general imo, are lightning in a bottle that we really aren't going to see captured again."

depression,fdqu0di,t3_emqv0o,1578674849.0,"For a day or two, and I feel on top of the world. It's astonishing to me how normal people feel that way 24/7, yet my worthless ass thinks about roping the majority of the time."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,fdfq2ow,t3_el3q7z,1578367486.0,"Silent Hill 2. The abstract daddy, the cutscenes before and after with angela, and then the writing on the wall are far better than if the game just spelled it out. It's not ""subtle"" about it, but it works."
TwoBestFriendsPlay,fdfivqf,t3_ekyk9p,1578362745.0,"Sparda is inferior to Devil Sword Dante, but I like using it for the classic DMC3&4 moveset, while also being visually more interesting than Rebellion. I like the idea of it being Dante's ""big problems only"" weapon."

depression,fcf4ee5,t3_eh1hgi,1577626515.0,"Same, essentially. I'm beyond ugly, make everyone uncomfortable in my presence, was born with autism that prevents me from ever truly being ""human"", so on and so forth. I'm fucked, plain and simple. The only way out is to successfully repress any and all sexual and/or romantic urges, as they do nothing but remind me of how I'm going to spend my life alone."
