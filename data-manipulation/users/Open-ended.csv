pics,ffz9z5o,t1_ffyxwjq,1580368982.0,Oil isn't a huge part of Dubai's economy anymore. The oilfields there were comparatively small and that's really one of the main reasons Dubai has made itself the luxury tourist destination as over the next 15-20 years their reserves will be exhausted.

They're just household names (providing a general interest in sport) like Beckham, Tyson, Brady, Woods, Federer, insert any of the above NBA players and none will look out of place."

AskReddit,ffmertm,t3_eu6iol,1580053520.0,"Around 1999 I used to play on a website called peachfuzz.net it was like an early version of miniclip / pogo and maybe hosted 10-15 games. Still, 1999, what more could I want. 

We get a new computer at school and at the end of the day our teacher lets us play on the computer as we did well in class. I think apart from me not many other kids were familiar with computers and definitely not the internet so I asked if we could go on peachfuzz, I go on it all the time at home. 

So, the teacher goes to www.peachfuzz.com

gifs,fdc6nlb,t1_fdaec5n,1578268147.0,"I saw Scarlett Johansson at a grocery store in NYC in 2015. I told her how cool it was to meet her in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother her and ask her for photos or anything.

She said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but she kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing her hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard her chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw her trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in her hands without paying.

The guy at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Maam, you need to pay for those first.” At first she kept pretending to be tired and not hear him, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When he took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, she stopped him and told him to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After he scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, she kept interrupting him by yawning really loudly."
