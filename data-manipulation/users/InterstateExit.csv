mildlyinteresting,ffebuqa,t1_ffeayio,1579842484.0,That was the only time I’ve picked citrus from a tree. It was a challenging trip to get there and having a vodka with fresh lemon after all that was a truly unique way to decompress.
mildlyinteresting,ffeacif,t1_ffe8u8d,1579841141.0,"I visited Greece and there was a huge lemon tree outside my rental house. Sun ripe lemons. So delicious. So green.

Well, I'm about as strong as can be, and I could not have made it this long unemployed if I hadn't have done it. Also, my brother and sister thought that once our mom died, I had a duty to the family to do the same caregiving for my aunt. I don't speak to them anymore. Good families are a real treasure."

My sense of duty made me feel ok about it but that was a critical time for me. I also had no help from my brother and sister, had to sell my house to make it work, and my entire life for that time revolved around making sure she was ok. My parents never even thought about what would happen to us."

himynameisjay,ff40blj,t1_ff358ft,1579552762.0,I've always found it rather amusing that the sub is only busy during work hours. Like everyone is doing their thing and yapping over the top of the cubicle farm to each other. It's wonderful.
rva,ff1pk9t,t3_er4tgt,1579483326.0,I don’t care about it. It makes the area stupid. It’s a pain in general. It looks nice but none of the municipalities around here plan for it because most winters are like this. Not sure what you expected living here.
