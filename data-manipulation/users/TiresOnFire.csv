I try to keep 2 on me at all times. You can kill chickens, part meat, open cans, cut down bushes and bark for fire. You can use it as a weapon, especially the hunting or combat knife, and you can cut up rags and burlap for crafting. If I have a knife I know I'll be ok. Just try to get something better than a steak knife, they break easily. Hunting knives are pretty common in cabins and hunting camps; safer than military zones. It's durable and works well as a weapon. In a pinch you can craft a knife with 2 stones if you can find them.

I've been trying to work on my inventory management and realizing the function to weight ratio of a knife helps you realize how much crap you really don't need."

I then head to a safe place in the woods start a fire and roast the meat. If I have a shotgun or rifle, I'll look for a goat since they provide plenty of meat. While I'm doing this I look for fruit and canned food as a bonus snack. I haven't had luck with deer yet. On 2 separate occasions I shot one in the head and he just ran away.
