Okay clearly I missed when THAT was shared on inceltears and on another note how come I've not heard about that sub through inceltears. God god damn.

Also for people beyond disturbed by that mods's comment, I recommend you don't go to inceltears lest 1. you're a woman and want to get panicked at every man you see  ever for fear they're an incel until the day you die. 2. you're a man and want to worry about ever women and girl you know for the rest of your life. 

The thing I like about that sub (IT) is that it's 3 things really. Complete piss take out of them, like this sub draws awareness to these people crazies and lastly if an incel is actually willing to chance they will be supportive, or if an incel is no longer one, they'll throw a celebration post. (A few months back a reformed incel posted and thanked the sub, it was very wholesome. Some even suggested setting up a reformed incel sub, wonder if they went through with that? Some suggested it might be a bad idea as incel's and alt-righters could try twisting the subs purpose.)"

And while some comments are worrying, I can't tell if they are being legit or in a sense taking the piss (like the one that commented greatest game ever) which being the net is an issue. In fact a few do seem to be taking the piss out of it. Did I not look down far enough to see the hate stuff?"

MonsterGirl,febfqnu,t1_feb0use,1578958334.0,"Its actually one of the better xenomorph ones I've seen. Others are more furry like. Of course there are others that go more into the human face, overall I'd say this is equivalent to Polt from Monster Musume"

GODZILLA,fe8z1j6,t1_fe8tnws,1578932449.0,Considering some of the animation shows that have won Oscars I consider them (the Oscars) as about as valid an award as Bubble the blind deaf jellyfish who has seen any media giving out awards.

How the fuck, I swear my google results mess with me when it comes to stuff I actually want to look up. (Flashback to last year when trying to look up the theory Triceratops being an omnivore, half the sites looked like they were made for kids the others had nothing on it. Gave up after 2 hours and asked on a paleo discord.)

Anyway again thanks, seriously. It's disappointing to hear this. As cute as they are, I can't deny their pain now. The sad thing is, like with dog breeds how do we stop this.

OH WTF!!"

Games,fdrr3r0,t1_fdri7tu,1578688391.0,"Lets not get started on the utter stupidity that was how they treated Star Wars Battlefront 3, discovered a few years ago the game was practically finished just needed advertising. The new head didn't think it would sell well and didn't want to fork over for advertising.

Yes cause the sequel to the best-selling star wars game (at the time) which itself was a sequel to (you guessed it) the best selling star wars game, was not going to make bank."
aww,fdqam2t,t3_emj3yr,1578661283.0,"Can  someone that complains about Munchkins please post a bloody source that they actually suffer miserable lives like pugs, king Charles spaniels etc I hear enough people outraged and others saying that shit is made up I'm tempted to conclude that everyone complaining about this bred is spouting nonsense they've hard and haven't fac checked. Not helping me being pushed in that direct is the fact that when I've looked I've yet to see vets being against the breed compared to say the Scottish Fold and I did a bloody college course on Animal care, the teachers hardly made an issue on them (with yeah don't expect them to jump high) meanwhile we knew all about the sins of dog breeds, alot of which were surprising."

StarWars,fdq97yq,t3_emmpw1,1578659948.0,"So uh, all agreed any straight or bi guys that has issues to the idea of being a damsel in distress to her Knight in shining armour has something wrong with them. (Don't think Lesbians would have that issue, unless any Lesbian tells me otherwise.)"
Scotland,fdq6ye6,t3_emnv4n,1578657516.0,"I remember wanting to do this, then 2 years ago, tomorrow (no joke) I was diagnosed with M.S. I can barely get around the house without crutches and need a wheelchair outside. It's pretty much death star'd any hope I have of doing this and visiting other areas of Scotland like Skye. Our holiday in Gallowway back in Oct was a bloody eye opener to that."
GODZILLA,fdq6w11,t1_fdpwia8,1578657439.0,"Not to be controversial, but I was told this by someone who despises the film. Toho sign off on Zilla's design, they sign off on that whole film. Then when people hated it they've acted like they had nothing to do with it.

I don't know how much of that is true but if it is, then the whole 2004 film is in my opinion Toho trying to have their cake and eat it too. So they signed off on 98, it was good enough for them, until their fans were pissed and they proceeded to act like they were not at fault.

Someone tell me, have I been fed bull or is that an actual good point."
