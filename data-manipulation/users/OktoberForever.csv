running,ffe9wd4,t3_esz91g,1579840752.0,"Thank you for posting this awesome data! This sent me down a rabbit hole because as a casual runner of 8 years, I noticed that after my daughter was born a year ago, I experienced a dramatic drop in running performance from around ~9:15/mi. to ~11:00/mi. Your post prompted me to try to draw a comparison between the hormonal changes in new fathers and those of transitioning women. I knew that becoming a new father causes a testosterone drop, but I had no idea it was as much as 25% - 30% (https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/09/fatherhood-decreases-testosterone) and I never thought to look into how lower testosterone affects transgender women running performance. Super interesting!  Keep up the analysis and the running!"

I bought five different pairs of Brooks, Saucony, and  Hoka (REI yard sale FTW). Some are great to run in, others of the same brand less so. I loved one pair of super pillowy Sauconys and hated another of similar model (Triumph). So definitely pay attention to what feels right and avoid buying something you can't return.

history,ff6l34n,t1_ff67zc0,1579629495.0,"I think it's just an expedient excuse for conquerors to claim that the were entitled in some way to conquer another people. Plenty of kingdoms and empires coexisted as allies and trading partners for centuries without viewing each other as degenerate or begging of conquest. However, from the Roman point of view, *Pax Romana* as a system of peaceful integration of disparate tribes was justification in-and-of itself to conquer neighboring people; those people would *by definition* be better-off afterward."
history,ff6jg9j,t3_erojdm,1579628502.0,"This may be apropos to none of your questions, but the economic draw of Britain was huge if only for the tin mining. Despite having iron-smelting capability, the Roman world still relied heavily on bronze as a metal, and tin is a key component of bronze. And it turns out that tin deposits are fairly scarce in Europe:

""Brittany – adjacent to Cornwall on the Celtic Sea – has significant sources of tin which show evidence of being extensively exploited after the Roman conquest of Gaul during the first century BC and onwards ""

(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_sources_and_trade_in_ancient_times)

So, having control over this resource was vital to the growth and maintenance of the empire."

Due west, a line of moving, unblinking, silent lights that started just above Venus and travelled to about 45°, then faded out.

I have always advocated for people to try as many resources as they can. Some people get a lot out of books, others get more out of videos, others learn better from online courses, still others need to build a few projects to get the hang of it. 

It's important to stick with coding, but don't stick with learning resources that you can't engage with. That's just making a difficult subject harder."

You're doing a lot of good shading on individual parts (scales, muscles, horns, etc.) but the overall creature doesn't have any shading, which robs it of all depth and makes it look extremely flat. That might be what you're going for, but if you're wanting to impart some more volume to it, you might want to pick an overall light source and shade the entire animal accordingly (i.e. large dark patches on the underside of the head, limbs, neck, tail; highlighted patches on the back, crown, tops of limbs and tail). Consider also adding a shadow underneath it. Otherwise neat concept!"

antkeeping,fco07gm,t1_fcmki3c,1577821728.0,"All of those sound like great ideas, especially the soaking for a week, I had never heard of that.

One nice thing I forgot to add about grout (and Portland cement, for that matter) is that it flows a lot nicer than concrete would into some of the smaller crevices of a design like yours. Depending on the aggregate that's in the concrete, something like Quikrete is going to have up to 1"" stones in it, which not only don't fit nicely into a small mould and might introduce some unwanted air bubbles/cracks, but also make the nest heaver and less water-permeable. Just a thought. You might be able to screen out some of larger rocks with some hardware cloth, or you might try making your own cement + sand + aggregate mixture. Let us know how it turns out!"
antkeeping,fcma7gk,t3_ehw456,1577768469.0,"I would caution against using concrete. I played around with Portland cement and perlite and the end result had that weird chemically concrete smell, possibly from the limestone. I decided not to use it because I worried that it was still too alkaline and that the high pH would affect the brood/colony in the long term. Obviously YMMV, but I saw a lot more people using unsanded grout, so that's what I ultimately chose to make my Camponotus colony out of and I have no complaints other than even with added perlite it still doesn't hydrate as thoroughly as I'd like it to. Hydration would be another concern with concrete. Aside from that, your design is dope! Good luck!"
therapy,fcj48p8,t3_eh1jbg,1577676881.0,"Hm. This sounds like difficult cycle to be in. From your description, I didn't get a sense that the therapists didn't take you seriously, but it definitely might seem that way. I just mean that none of the examples you gave were clearly the therapist being dismissive. It might help to look at it from their point of view: they meet new people all the time with different issues in their lives. They might just need more time to get to know you. It takes time to build the sort of relationship where the therapist can help you heal; it isn't all about analyzing and diagnosing. In the beginning, those questionnaires are pretty standard and can help get some of the big issues out on the table. However, I think most therapists would be sympathetic if you let them know the concerns you have right up front and ask them to explain more of their process to you during each session. I think that would be totally acceptable and might help demystify some of the work. Just try and remember that the end goal is a therapist who knows you really well and who you can trust, and this might take the better part of a year  to achieve. My two cents. Best wishes!"
