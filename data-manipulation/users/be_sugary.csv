brexit,ffzdvft,t1_ffyk4sm,1580374118.0,"I think in the coming years we will all feel what the point of voting was.

Brexit is only beneficial for the big multi-national companies- so they can drive down human rights, environmental protection policies and all such things that help protect people and the environment. Without the EU protections and numbers we are sitting ducks.  You may have heard how Trump is rolling back the laws in USA - I think the same is going to happen here after Brexit.

But I am very hopeful that change will come - necessity is the mother of all invention-  problems will trigger people to react. Maybe we will work out something better..."

You are not alone in feeling isolated- it's always hurtful but don't ponder on it too much. Think ahead and plan lovely things for yourself in the present and in the future. Self care and self love hold the key to finding good friendships. Be your own best friend.
