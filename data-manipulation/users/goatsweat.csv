muacirclejerk,ffhnqtl,t1_ffhenh6,1579944274.0,Oh my god she got 57 tins for Christmas??? 57!!!! Why would anyone ever need that amount of Vaseline I don’t understand.
muacirclejerk,ffhh5hc,t1_ffgz9hw,1579935030.0,srs Check yahoo japan auctions!!! That’s where I get those Japanese alpaca plushies and I’ve never had a problem. I can link you a guide on how to use it if you want!
SkincareAddiction,ffger9v,t1_fffzsmm,1579904603.0,"This is my issue too. I have fairly good, easy to manage skin, but I have a really hard time not picking at it. And I scar extremely easily so I have a lot of hyperpigmentation. It’s so hard to fight the urge but I have to remember that if I don’t want another scar, I have to resist lol"
SkincareAddiction,ffge9jr,t1_fffws8u,1579904292.0,I dated a guy that just used 3-in-1 and his hair was so soft and nice. Once he used my fancy salon shampoo and conditioner and he didn’t like it because his hair was “too clean”.
dogs,ff2cw56,t1_ff1yghc,1579501090.0,"I would have preferred a ban with provisions put in place to help the dogs find homes. I don’t disagree with the ban, I just wish it were done in a better way."
dogs,ff1ki8v,t1_ff18jb9,1579480655.0,"Yes, I very much agree with your points. I think a lot of time legislation that seems good at first can cause more harm than good. Kinda like the greyhound racing ban that had no provisions for finding the dogs homes."
premed,ff1ijbn,t1_ff1b7k8,1579479768.0,"I think at a few specific schools they do consider LGBT+ a URM, but you have to be involved with volunteering for that community. I read this on SDN from an adcom but I’m not sure if the information is still correct. You can search the forums to find out which schools. A couple schools on the west coast will also consider Southeast Asians URM as well. 

So yes, according to AAMC we are ORMs, but each school can make exceptions to their criteria (Most don’t of course, but there are a few)."
premed,ff183o8,t1_fezcakf,1579476148.0,"It’s important to note that this only applies to white ORMs. Asians are considered ORM, but they definitely experience discrimination based on their race. I think people tend to lump Asians with white people in the ORM debate and forget that we have very real struggles when it comes to racial discrimination in the US. Also, while East Asians tend to have a higher income, Southeast Asians tend to be disadvantaged in a similar way to URMs. 

I don’t really care about the whole URM vs. ORM thing, I just wanted to point this out because I see it a lot on this subreddit and it bothers me lol"
dogs,ff11hb2,t1_ff0jv6w,1579474324.0,How would that work? Would they send dogs out of state if there are too many? Or just refuse to accept dogs they don’t think they can adopt out? I know Delaware could do it because they are relatively small and don’t have much of an overpopulation problem. I thought Cali had a bigger overpopulation issue? I don’t know anything about the shelter systems there so idk.
ADHD,feiwf0k,t1_feisjjl,1579149056.0,"Haha yeah that’s true, they have a high chance of passing on depression or ADHD. Especially the depression, so far at least one person of each generation after my grandma has it. Luckily they are doing well with treatment, and I am doing my best to get better. :-)"
ADHD,feiw1qj,t1_feirvry,1579148761.0,"Having kids is really just a big gamble and you have to hope you get lucky. Everyone has something like that in their family history that could be passed on, there’s no escaping it. Not to mention the disorders that aren’t genetic and just happen randomly. I’d say if you know the possibilities and are prepared for them, then you’re already doing way more than most parents. Doesn’t make it any less scary though."
ADHD,feih51e,t3_ep5g9x,1579138415.0,I ended up getting all the mental illness in my family too. Depression and narcolepsy from my grandma and ADHD from my grandpa. I also developed BPD from the way I was raised/past childhood trauma. The kicker is that both of my siblings are completely fine and high functioning people. They get amazing grades and don't have the issues I have with maintaining relationships. Both of my parents are fine too so I don't have anyone in my family that really understands me very well. I can't really do anything about this so I try not to complain too much and just try to get better but it's really annoying to think about sometimes.
tumblr,fefr93o,t1_feezaps,1579062888.0,When was this? I was never shown a heroin video like that but maybe it was before I started high school?
