Possibly in admissions to secondary school too.

We also had mandatory vaccinations for the hpv
 vaccine during school and you could only exempt yourself if you had a doctors note saying you already took it."
insanepeoplefacebook,ffcymlc,t1_ffcq548,1579809965.0,"I'd agree, but is the battle of 1066 really that interesting? no, learning about what this country did, how we created concentration camps in the boer war, how these colonies fought with us in the world wars? It will help a lot in an increasingly toxic country, in terms of understanding our neighbours and their contributions. How many times do I have to learn about ww2 where we're the saviours, or learn about the US' mistakes in civil rights and vietnam? Why is it impossible to look at our own doorstep and realise a lot of the things in our museums are stolen? hell you'd get a secondary school history trip out of it. It would be a win win imo to a hopefully more tolerant and understanding country."

insanepeoplefacebook,ffc5f28,t1_ffby3lg,1579791942.0,"Unfortunately the UK hates to address its past as colonial slavemasters. I only know about Irelands potato famine as we had advanced reading in year 6, and then we learnt more about Ireland in A-level history /: we spent a lot of compulsory history on shitty stuff like the battle of hastings, the cromwells, some interesting stuff like jack the ripper, and then we also did the slave trade. GCSEs were about vietnam and ww2, as well as mods and rockers. A-levels was UK politics from 1899-1924, ww2 again (why do we have such a obsession with Hitler??), then American civil rights from 1899-2000.

Colonialism should be taught from year 7, each year we should have a look at a different country and how it impacted it."

soccer,ffalmdh,t1_ffalbc8,1579738823.0,"1 instance of them not being stigmatised means suddenly all of them arent stigmatised?

We also gonna say all black men are criminals too and then think its right to be racist against them too? Treat criminals as criminals, treat innocent people as people.

I don't suddenly start hating white people every single time they kill innocent black men in the US. Use your common sense instead of seeing colour."
soccer,ffajlcg,t1_ffaj8qy,1579737345.0,"Fucking hell, typical racists argument. 

This is one instance, I haven't said that the police actions were correct, in fact I think its disgusting that they did it in fear of being accused as a racists- esp because they had proof of all of those rapes happening.
The fact of the matter is, 99% of muslims are stigmatised for being muslim, for going to a mosque, for wearing a hijab, and they've done nothing but subscribe to a religion. There are shit people everywhere, I never said one is better than the other, but by god if you think muslims and christians are seen as equal in this country you're delusional."
soccer,ffajbsk,t1_ffaigec,1579737145.0,"You do realise there are shit people on both sides and I never said one was better than the other.

The point is, the UK is a hostile environment especially for minorities, in the current climate. And you are genuinely lying if you think people regard muslims the same way as they regard christians. Or think christians receive worse treatment than our muslim residents."

The camera was just on the guy, he says the comment straight after when it then films the rest of the crowd. How is it a coincidence? He saw brown guy, finally thought of a comment and says it as it the camera moves off."

So the bank robbers comments by Johnson was shut down? the fact that Zac Goldsmith ran a campaign on Sadiq Khan being a terrorist didn't get shut down by other politicians either. Genuinely, where are you seeing it, in mainstream media, that Christianity is condemned?  

There are shitty parts of every single religion, but lets not act like Christianity is attacked on the same level Islam is."

has there been many instances of commentators saying get the prayer mats out in football? or time to go to church? my money is on there hasn't been"
soccer,ffac04t,t1_ffabo7a,1579731965.0,"The church isn't stigmatised or made to be shameful the same way as being a muslim has. Lets not act like its just about praying, being a muslim in this country is seen as an insult. You can't seriously tell me that someone going to a Church would be seen the same way if someone said they needed to go to a Mosque in the UK.

edit: lmao the real racists are coming out of the woodwork. The average muslim is subject to far more hate crime than their white counterparts. For subscribing to Islam, for wearing a hijab, speaking arabic and visiting a mosque. I never said that one is superior to the other, i'm saying muslims and christians and their religious practices are not deemed to be equal. Christmas is everywhere, and thats fine and I love it as do my muslim friends, but as soon as you see Eid Muburak or Happy Ramadan people get triggered. Be respectful, treat everyone equally, its really not that fucking hard. There are terrible people everywhere."

I also feel some people won't reply to you if you're not the opposite sex, I feel a lot of people here are also looking for relationships and then get upset or less interested if you're taken. My bf gets ghosted by guys, i've got ghosted by plenty of girls, do these people want a friend? I genuinely do try my best but OP is right, some people just don't try and leave you with really crap responses and nothing to work with.
