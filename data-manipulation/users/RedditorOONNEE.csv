changemyview,ffm4tr3,t1_ffm2gzz,1580048565.0,"Well honestly I think the “Every religion” part is quite a flaw in that logic, there isnt a way to truly characterize every religion. And even then there are religions like buddhism about giving up what you have and humility which wouldnt go very well with a government trying to foster economic stability if everyone is constantly in need."
changemyview,ffm18u7,t1_fflle5t,1580046910.0,"I know we’re here for OP, but if you allow me, I will attempt to change your mind or at least your perspective of this.

Religions are sets of beliefs that people hold dear to themselves, most of these come from a sort of Godly messenger, here to spread truth. Most if not all religions have humble starts where the ideas are developed and spread gradually, and eventually gain power within a state (if its big enough). Heck, take the largest current religion, Christianity, as an example of this, Christianity was spread by one guy to 12 people who kept spreading it until their deaths but had people under them that continued the cycle. Christianity didnt have any power early on, and most christians were persecuted and used as scapegoats for evil. Often times the ruling state has conflicts that compete with the religion where they wish it just didnt exist. These are just a few examples of the problems in the current argument. Power and creation of religion dont go hand in hand, but often times against one another."

todayilearned,fehysqt,t1_fehwd66,1579126604.0,"Alright lets take this point by point.

1) the author of the article only points out media portrayal of a good life and how minorities werent often shown as part of that, not a great argument against racism since thats just media portrayal rather than actual discrimination.

2) this is a poll of which aren’t usually considered hard evidence since this is the opinion rather than the evidence and if people really believe that there is a group of people against them (through media coverage of one off incidents) then they are primed to dislike them well before an encounter occurs and more likely to cause tension with the relation between people.

3) (btw its hard to take ben and jerrys seriously in politics) a lot of the points were cultural problems in the black community (I can say this growing up in a city with one of the highest African American population and usually being around the culture through friends and neighbors and my own community) where crime is romanticized or praised through music and family atmosphere that this largely affects the development of children and incarceration rates. Even one of the sources you provided has a poll sourced saying that anti-black behavior is not as much as a problem as anti-white behavior according to those surveyed. Of course there are some of the studies in there that are interesting and would need a closer look like the housing one.

Also rather than insult me right of the bat, you shouldve heard my argument, I wasnt affected but there are a lot of people taught not to question what they know for fear of being ostracized. Which is a problem since a big factor of finding the truth is not settling into what you think you know especially without hard evidence."
todayilearned,fehup3o,t1_fehrn3r,1579124234.0,"Idk what you’re talking about with the shoe thing (could you provide a link).
But racism is largely a thing of the past, this isnt something supported and expected in society, and is seen as wrong, as it should be. Idk what you’re talking about with MLK and slavery since being conservative, Ive never heard the argument against those (and doesnt make sense since Lincoln founded the republican party). And then you go and mention Obama, which also doesnt make sense because he received a lot of support from democrats and a decent chunk of republicans."

todayilearned,fehtqef,t1_fehr1gs,1579123687.0,"I live in Columbia,SC, this city has one of the highest African American population in the US. Ive talked to so many people about modern day racism, because Im interested in how the past was so much more different than now, and never have I come across someone who says theyve been the victim of racism. Mind you this is all from the perspective of a hispanic male with two migrant parents.

Now for the examples, I agree all of these are racist INDIVIDUALS acting out of their own hate, none of this is supported by anyone but the ignorant and these people are only a minority, you cant say racism is the same as it used to be because these are one off incidents in a society where its seen as wrong.

P.s. My sympathy goes out to you if you were truly discriminated against because of your race, that is utterly indefensible and hope that those people got what they deserved."

Sex isnt and shouldn’t be a way validation you might have to do a self evaluation if this is what determines your self worth or your approval to other people.
