It makes me feel better knowing what I'm feeling isn't forever.

I'm sorry you are going through a hard time friend.  Things will get better. :)"

DecidingToBeBetter,fcnqycp,t3_ei67h0,1577816772.0,"The problem is that you want to be liked.  

If you start loving and finding worth in yourself, the opinions of others wont matter because you'll know that you are a good person and that you are doing your best.

If they don't like you, that's just that.  There are a lot of people in this world.  Not being liked by a few isn't a big deal.  Learn to like yourself and it won't bother you as much."

Mindfulness meditation helps me catch myself before I get caught up in habitual things like being on my phone.  Practicing being mindful and in the moment helps with things like that tremendously.  Look up Vipassana meditation on youtube. :)"

I tried for a long time to make my depressed mother happy.  I spent a lot of energy trying to help her.  It didn't work and she ended up resenting me for my efforts.  Sometimes you have to be compassionate to yourself and let it go."
