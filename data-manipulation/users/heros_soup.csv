AskReddit,fdvm9jy,t3_en72ei,1578748954.0,"I was working as an Assistant Store Leader for GameStop when I learned from my boss there was a box in the stockroom that was never to be opened. She labeled it ""T-Shits"". Apparently,  before I worked there, a child had shit on the floor in the store, and rather than the parent cleaning it up, they grabbed their kid and left. Well, the ASL before me decided to clean it up with t-shirts? Like actually merchandise? The store lost about 300 dollars in merch, so rather than shrinking them out, they kept them in a box in the back with barcodes to scan during inventory counts until they got moved out  of the system. The worst part is the t-shits box stayes next to the break table. 


Alternatively, literally every time someone brought in a roach infested system to trade. Like, get the fuck out of here with that nasty shit.

Oh, or the time someone brought in an xbox that had jizz stains on everything... or the 360 that had cat pee in it. 



Honestly, people are disgusting. That's what I learned working for GameStop. That and there isnt enough hand sanitizer to ever convince me to work there again."
