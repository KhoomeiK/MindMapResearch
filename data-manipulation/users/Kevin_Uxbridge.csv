EDIT for the person who deleted their reply: the host being extinct makes it unlikely a virus will be able to make the jump to us but that doesn't stop the idea from popping up in popular literature.  Scientist digs up an old virus, gets it, and it runs amok - *extremely* unlikely for something that's never seen an organism like us.

AskReddit,fesqki1,t1_fesni7q,1579367982.0,"Yep, even the Bible talks about Jesus being executed next to criminals.  It’s a terrible way to go and was the Roman way of making an example of you.  The fact that the Romans didn’t bother rounding up his supporters (also SOP, I’ve read) shows that they didn’t consider him much of a public nuisance.  But enough.

Question remains though why would Jesus ‘allow himself’ to be put to death if he could have done something about it?  Mark’s Jesus probably couldn’t have stopped it - he died feeling forsaken, his last words show that.  John’s Jesus on the other hand, was such a majestic figure that when the Romans sent out a cohort to apprehend him, they ended up on their faces.  And yet Jesus decides that it’s god’s will that he die, so of course he allows himself to be killed.  

My take (avid reader of higher literary bible stuff): they couldn’t change the end of the story because all the Jesus movements agreed by John’s time that Jesus was in fact crucified, so how do we make sense of this?  Between Mark’s writing and John’s, the story had already been reinterpreted so maybe crucifixion wasn’t such a shameful end after all.  Not if you went into it for a reason, certainly.  Once they figured out how Jesus being put to a Roman death for Roman reasons by Romans wasn’t really Rome’s fault, the circle was complete."

If you were creating Jesus out of whole cloth, why would you have him put to a humiliating, shameful death?  And what about that story when he begins his ministry and his family shows up, asking people to ignore him because he's obviously gone a bit loony.

The problem stemmed from the fact that, by 1996 (and continuing on to this day), tour operators were doing all they could to usher people to the top in record numbers, for money.  This was true to the extent of having sherpa short-rope unqualified climbers and basically dragging them up to the top.  This is dangerous not only for them but also for everyone else.  Too many folks up there actually caused traffic jams, with people standing around exposed to danger and cold, waiting their turn at choke points like the Hillary Step.  It also meant that when these folks got into danger, anyone with a conscience and the ability to do so risked themselves to rescue them.

Against these practical concerns is the more philosophical question of 'what does it mean to climb a mountain'.  If you're not qualified to get up there under your own steam, should you really be up there at all?  Should I be helping you do this?  Why, so you can go home to your friends and say 'I bagged Everest'?  

This school of thought is shared by many climbers who eschew guiding the unqualified. Bourkreev was apparently of this opinion, but as he was hired as a professional guide by Mountain Madness, Scott Fisher supposedly told him that he needed to be more of a guide and less of a 'fellow climber' with the clients. 

This lack of agreement about exactly what Bourkreev's duties were resulted in Bourkreev coming down from the summit back to the Southern Col ahead of many of the clients, who were still up there when the weather hit.  

Regardless, Bourkreev's behavior after things went to shit was, by all accounts, fucking *heroic*, and he saved several lives while risking his own life in the process.  This is all from memory so I'm happy to be corrected on the details here."
