worldnews,ffe8665,t1_ffdyaru,1579839323.0,There are literally posts in here saying they think the death toll is in the 10s of thousands. Its ridiculous fear-mongering to an admittedly bad situation. Its fucking absurd. If you listen to Reddit you'd think that China will be extinct in 6 months.

nfl,ff47yz2,t1_ff43jmq,1579557516.0,"Literally the laws every other civilized western nation has that has 1/10th the level of gun violence we do? 40000 people were killed with guns last year in the US. That's the same number of people who died from opiate overdose and we act like that's a huge epidemic, yet when we try to discuss any kind of legislation involving firearms literally anything is too much."
funny,ff3zy9g,t1_ff3fqwc,1579552533.0,"If you were born in 1994, you were 6 when the 90s ended, you didn't experience any of the cultural touchstones of the 90s. Even people born in 1989 would only have been 11. 90s kids were actually sentient when the 90s started and grew up during the 90s, so it's more like 1980-1987. If you don't remember Nevermind coming out, you're not a 90s kid."
todayilearned,ff0di6d,t1_ff01y64,1579467887.0,"You actually went back to your comment to see who replied to it, then typed up the lamest fucking insult imaginable. I'm pretty sure you're the loser in this scenario."

SquaredCircle,fekvg9h,t1_fek8op1,1579208423.0,"I'd say first 3 seasons of Family Guy were really good, next 3 seasons were OK, then it just fell off a cliff. It's been horrible for 10 years now."
worldnews,feiaouo,t1_fei8ffe,1579134083.0,"Eh.. true. Are you slow, or do you just lack basic critical thinking skills? Just because they are only 18 percent of the countries demographics doesn't mean they aren't a much larger percentage of the *voting* demographic. People under 18 can't even vote, so that's 13 millions out of the 65 millions who aren't even eligible. You can't just pull up a countries total demographics and tell anything about the people who are actually voting. That's just piss poor analysis.

Here you go numbnut: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268018301320
Actual peer-reviewed analysis of people of who voted that shows leave voters skewed older, white, lower educated, on benefits and lower income. Sorry that leave voters are old, poor and stupid."
Seahawks,feht4is,t1_fehg7lo,1579123345.0,"We've always suckle at 3rd and long. We ducked at 3rd and long when we had the LoB, it's just the style of defense they play. They don't want to give up explosive plays so they're willing to give up a 10 yarder. It will probably always be like that while Pete is here."
Seahawks,fe6bt9a,t1_fe68vss,1578886438.0,"Yeah I couldn't believe that. There were 7 guys obstructing his view and he calls a TD. Replay shows the ball didn't break the plane, but not conclusively enough to overturn a call that shouldn't have been made in the first place!"
todayilearned,fe0xb6w,t1_fe0fg1z,1578819769.0,"Bruh that's really fucking tacky to bring that up in a topic like this even if her name was the ""inspiration"" for this thread. No one cares that your dumpy ass hired a prostitute."

Seahawks,fe0wggt,t1_fe0f6gq,1578819532.0,And we didn't pay him or Shetman because they were toxic in the locker room. They never got over the Superbowl loss.
funny,fdm14j0,t1_fdlxypq,1578537323.0,"Well if it didn't happen overnight its obviously never going to happen! Come back in 10 years and we can have the discussion. Its fucking moronic to think that they will push these changes through in just 2 years and if your argument is ""Nothing bad happened yet!"" you're a fucking moron incapable of even elementary critical thinking."
todayilearned,fdlmj3x,t1_fdlmaxy,1578527397.0,"Buses don't run on a right of way, those railcars would've been replaced with much faster models and they have a much higher capacity than buses. Buses should be used for last leg travel, high capacity rail should be used on heavily traveled corridors. They work in conjunction and you can't just replace one with the other."
worldnews,fdi0691,t1_fdhx8mq,1578433366.0,"Literally the same argument made about WMDs in Iraq before Iraq war 2. Forgive me if I don't believe or trust the Republican administration. I'll need a lot more evidence than ""sorry, classified"" before I believe a word out of their mouths."
nottheonion,fdep02p,t1_fdenxy7,1578343617.0,"Yeah, because the economy crashed while Bush was still in office. Pretty sure the economy improved every single year Obama was in office, so not sure what you're even trying to say here."
Seahawks,fdd3ath,t1_fdcpqj4,1578293038.0,"Bruh, this kind of hit has happened literally dozens of times to Wilson. Look at the 1st San Fran game. He was targeted by two SF players while going to the ground and no flag was thrown. Did you hear any death threats in the r/NFL thread? Did you hear any Seattle fans hoping that those two players tear their ACL? Or that they should be suspended or kicked out of the league? People were upset, which is fine, but none of those things happened, because we're not a bunch of fucking lunatics. We're a bunch of whiny douchebags who complain about our coach who gets us to the playoffs every year, but we aren't wishing harm on other players for bang-bang plays. Take a class in Newtonian physics, you obviously don't understand how it works."
nfl,fdcig5g,t1_fdccohr,1578275702.0,"Wait, are people honestly shitting on McCown's play? I though he did pretty well for a 40 year old backup QB."
Seahawks,fdcec0u,t1_fdcch0b,1578272814.0,"It should have been penalized, but it was hardly a dirty hit. I thought the exact same thing in the San Fran game when two of their players went after Russ when he was sliding to the ground. Should have been a penalty then too, but I wasn't calling the SF defense dirty."
Seahawks,fdce63l,t1_fdcd154,1578272701.0,"Bruh, we had just as many injuries as they did. A dirty hit requires intent. Clowney has literally never had a questionable play, but because of one mistake he's dirty? We already beat Philly in Philly with Wentz earlier this year and he wasn't exactly lighting the game on fire when he was playing. Get a fucking clue man."
Seahawks,fdcdkkd,t1_fdccodu,1578272292.0,Well deserved. Don't be a shithead.
Seahawks,fdcdexq,t1_fdccqwh,1578272187.0,"No shit man, he's the first string QB for a reason."
Seahawks,fdcdbcl,t1_fdccxrd,1578272122.0,"Agreed. Should have called a penalty, but from everything I've seen out of Clowney he doesn't seem like a dirty player and there wasn't intent to injure on the hit. I hate to see a game go like that though, wish Wentz could have finished it."
worldnews,fd7kymz,t1_fd6zsg1,1578206106.0,"No matter how bad global warming gets on Earth, it will still be 1000x more hospitable than fucking Mars. Where do you people get this bizarre idea that the rich are going to colonize Mars because of global warming? This isn't the first time I've heard this and it's just silly. If we have the technology to geo-engineer Mars, then wouldn't we, you know, have the same technology to geo-engineer the planet that actually supports human life?"

Seahawks,fclmqo0,t1_fcl7k00,1577751431.0,"I've said it before, but I'll be happy to go 4-12 after Pete leaves if it means getting rid of obnoxious ""fans"" like you. I know you've never seen a Seahawk game before 2012, but I remember the 90s teams and we're far more likely to get that with a new coach than we are to get another Pete Carrol."

news,fciwwez,t1_fciw1hb,1577671765.0,So the Keystone cops here weren't watching the points of egress? How incompetent are they? Well they did taser an unarmed 70 year old woman so I guess that answers that question. Of course the bootlickers are out in force here defending their actions.

Liverwurst, pig heart, any kind of stinky fish dish, durian etc., but the one thing I've ever seen her eat that made her gag was Natto. It's like eating fermented slime, it's just foul.

You've made multiple comments in this thread that show you literally have 0 idea what the you're talking about. It's obvious you have seen zero art from this decade because your head is stuck up your ass.
