EnoughCommieSpam,ffuhq8f,t3_ev88l2,1580242194.0,"1. Better than not having your basic needs met at all under communism

2. Again, you’re exploited more under communism with little in return

4. This is hardly a problem at all

5. There has never been a successful economic system in the world that has had equal wealth for everyone. Nothing has even gotten close to that. Don’t complain about problems there is no solution for.

6. Poverty has been decreasing immensely since the spread of capitalism https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty"
