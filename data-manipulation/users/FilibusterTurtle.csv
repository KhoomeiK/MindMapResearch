twilightimperium,fff4tup,t1_fff3zr6,1579875724.0,"I think a fair takeaway - though really the only relevant one - is that Destroyers are a dirt cheap source of the extra one or two ships you might need to trigger Assault Cannon.

twilightimperium,ffewk89,t1_ffdwtyo,1579868483.0,"Everything you say is true, but I think the fact that your lovely defence of Destroyer (2) is basically 'it's situationally fine!' is kinda the reason OP asked the question. No other unit except War Suns is only situationally good. No other unit (except War Sun) asks you to trudge through two techs you probably don't want to upgrade it. No other ship (except War Sun) doesn't even really do its main job until you upgrade it. No other ship AT ALL is good because it's essentially the cost-effective or the next-best replacement for the other things you WANTED to use instead - like a destroyer screen to replace a fighter screen vs an upgraded PDS network, or a destroyer to occupy a space you'd LIkE to cover with a bigger ship but money is precious y'know?

Again, I absolutely agree with your points by themselves. I've used destroyers for all those reasons. But the fact that that is the best honest defence of the humble Destroyer (2) is the whole problem.

That's how you move the conversation forward.

twilightimperium,fexwxeu,t1_fewnvlg,1579437785.0,"Rednoughts is a pretty popular homebrew/houserule change to the tech tree: it changes the tech requirements for Dreadnoughts from BBY to RRB. Not only is this more thematic, it makes Red better than absolute shit, and it makes Blue techs a little less must-pick.

What this does to the balance of the races is great too: almost all of the races that get buffed - with a less clunky tech path - are the B or C tier warfighter factions, like Sardakk and Barony and Muaat. Meanwhile, it either slightly nerfs (or at least doesn't buff) most of the A and S tier factions. And since it opens up the tech tree, you get more varied and unique feeling races with more diverse fleet comps. Without Grav Drive being an auto-get with Dreads (and vice versa really) traditional Dread factions hit harder than more Blue-ish factions....but then the Blue factions will have that mobility and Grav Drive advantage over Dread factions.

twilightimperium,fev75k3,t1_fev6gwe,1579393920.0,"Yeah hundred percent. This is another thing that IMO Rednoughts goes a little way to solving. I mean, would you really go 2 deep into Red to unlock Destroyer 2? Ok, but would you go 2 Red for Destroyer 2 and Dread 2?

Another thing that I think would possibly fix Red (though this might be too much) is bringing back Hylar V, replacing PS or Magen - and obviously removong the +1 to combat rolls for Destroyer 2 and Cruiser 2. Part of why players went Red more in TI3 was that Hylar V was such a good, accessible tech. So you were already IN Red half the time in the same way that Sarween or Neural are almost gimmes for Yellow and Green. And while this change doesn't make Destroyer 2 any better it does drip feed your Destroyer UPGRADE so that you aren't waiting 3 goddamn techs just to have decent Destroyers."
twilightimperium,fev3z7b,t1_feuy45d,1579392864.0,"Grav Drive is definitely hard to say no to. I think the bigger problem though is that Blue gets to double dip while Red does not. What I mean is, get two Blue techs and a Yellow and you can now build the most cost effective fighting vessel in the game. Let me say that again: by investing in MOBILITY you get the most efficient FIGHTING vessel in the game.

Meanwhile in Red you get no mobility whatsoever. So while mobility isn't the be all end all, it's like: do you want a bit of everything or do you...not want that? Rednoughts is a big step towards fixing that problem. Red has other problems too, but I think this is key: Blue gets a little bit of everything for the least investment, so since you're on a clock here why not go Blue?

Obviously the designers wanted the tech requirements for the unit upgrades to kinda reflect the 'colours' that you invested in. So the Blue in Dread requirements represents the mobility that you wanted and paid for. But when you give Dreads out for BBY...that kinda undercuts that you should have invested in some Red to get such good dakka."

They just had nothing to say when they ran out of prewritten material for them. But tbh, until we see GRRM finish his series, we can't know for sure whether he will stick the landing either. Probably the hardest part about writing a sprawling ensemble series is tying all the threads together by the finale. Ending it in a way that ties up all of the themes, all of the characters and the overarching plot - and does all of that WELL.

I grew up middle class, so I was filled with this vague idea that education and preparing for a lifetime of professional work was a good way to spend my time. I was a bookish nerd.

But during my 20s I realised that I  needed to socialise and make friends and get to know people. Improve my social skills and group of friends.

And I'm 1000% glad I did, because upon my first taste of professional middle class life, I sunk into a deep deep depression. I ran through all my money buying fast food and alcohol, I struggled with jobs just to get by, I lost my fitness and gained weight. And the people in my life that helped me the most? Almost to a man (and woman) they were the working class (or former working class) friends I had.

I don't think this is because they're better people than my middle class friends. It's too simple to proclaim the quiet nobility of the poor: plenty of poor people are cunts too. I just think those working class friends of mine tended to have a better sense of what it means to be struggling and needing help, and so they had a stronger tendency to help out. When you really look at it honestly, you start to see how lonely and alienated the Western middle class life is.

And almost all of them had those kinds of hobbies the OP's family has. Sports, clubbing, handicrafts and trades.

There's probably a fair bit of anti-intellecualism and resentment of education in OP's family's views. But there MAY also be a sense that what you really need to get through life are those other things - hands on skills, fitness, a community.

For starters that planet I didn't NEED to take was actually one of the last I needed that turn for 'control four planets of a single type (?)' and the last planet I would need for the backup 'control six planets outside your home system' - which I hadn't claimed last turn but would lose the chance to score this turn if I gave the player back his homeworld - which again, I wanted to because I didn't want to ruin his game. So the choices were: stay on his homeworld for the six planets VP, leave his homeworld and take another on my way out so that he can get back in the game and I can still claim that VP....or run at his roughly equivalent fleet on the most direct route home. (I also realised in hindsight that I could have explained all this to him...but given his reaction I feel like he would have just used that knowledge to more directly fuck with my game plan.)

I had actually spent a good one to two rounds looking for alternatives to what I (the Arborec) was seeing: that in order to win I would have to eat at least two of his juiciest systems, and the nearest alternatives on my other borders weren't near enough. Then the homeworld objective came up and I just saw no better option than to go in, take the homeworld, leave, claiming an objective on the way out in the path least painful for both of us....and then let him take it all back as he pleased 

In actual fact, I could have won that game, and partly BECAUSE I turned back. I ended up owning two pie slices by the end of the game. I didn't want to take that route, because I hate eliminating players and ruining their fun, but, well, the gloves came off...it was only some unrelated misplays on my part in later turns that fucked my own chances for victory.

So while you never mentioned liberalism, he was pointing out that this is a natural tendency in economic liberalism. Economic liberalism is self-destructive because it creates political extremism, whether or not 'liberals', well meaning or otherwise, really mean it to.

To drastically simplify, the argument goes: economic liberalism (by which I mean a rough collection of principles and laws that emerged and succeeded in England during the 17th century or at least developed from that starting point, especially the changes in property rights that came from the enclosure movement, and which K want to distinguish from the more laudable principles of political/social liberalism) allows an idle propertied class not just to exist (which is a problem in many other systems) but ALSO to suck progressively more and more wealth and value from the productive class (that is, people who actually work, and thereby contribute to society). This is often defended by classical and neoliberals as just a natural market process, or a reward for the wealthy just being so much smarter than the rest of us, or a 'win win' situation where everyone is made richer, but while these arguments have SOME truth they also have huge problems and critiques which imma leave for now to not get sidetracked.

As this squeezing process intensifies, the working poor are made poorer and more desperate. Seeking an end to their pain, they turn to politics. That is, they vote for extremists who promise to make the pain go away. Or they demonstrate and protest. Or they unionise. Or they become violent. Or they begin to hate The Other - whatever Other they are told are The Real Enemy, who is taking all the wealth and jobs away - Jews, immigrants, black people, rich people, commies, whatever Other fits the context and personal world view each particular poor person.

Or they do some combination of the above.

That, as the argument goes, is how economic liberalism naturally creates extremism and authoritarianism.

(And I just want to get in before any Redditor who thinks they're about to spew a particular kind of top-tier political commentary, coz you see it all the damn time on Reddit: yes, OBVIOUSLY despotism and tyranny and authoritarianism also emerge from totally different social orders as well. But saying the USSR existed isn't a defence for a bug in the liberal program. It's whataboutism, not a serious response. Hell, the USSR's very existence is considered by many to be just another tragic example of what happens when the liberal world order runs its full course.)

twilightimperium,fdtewmd,t1_fdqhafh,1578715770.0,"I actually had to nip the first bud of this kind of behaviour in my own group just last game.

Normally our table is pretty thick skinned. We don't generally accept betrayal of clear agreements, but other than that it's considered poor form to be petty or hold grudges.

But as we were setting up for last game one of us said something like (possibly unfair paraphrase): 'I think sometimes when you're out of the running you just decide to drag down the player who most obviously put you there.' This put me on edge, especially since some players nodded or grunted agreement.

Well by sheer coincidence, that conundrum happened to me: I took a player's home system for the 2VP objective to do it. Next turn I left it (sadly having to take another of his planets on the way out coz the alternative was his main fleet :( ) so that he could rebuild. I didn't want to fuck his game just because. Well instead of retaking his home system he rammed his fleet right into mine. I got a tad lucky on the dice rolls and won. He openly admitted he did it coz he'd given up on winning and just wanted to hurt my own game.

So the next turn I went back to his home system. I then spent the rest of the game eliminating him. When someone said something like 'looks like you're taking this personal' (which was true) I simply said 'well I've lost patience for a guy who has admitted he wants to fuck with my game out of revenge'.

You can't let that kind of tit for tat stand. It breaks the game. And this comes from a guy who can be a little vindictive on points of honour (ie, betrayals and backstabs)."
twilightimperium,fdt9o2k,t1_fdqapnh,1578713739.0,"Yeah, your first para is hugely important, but I think it also ties back to what norms the table eatablishes.

If a table has come to accept that backstabbing or the constant breaking of non-binding deals is just part of the game...then it will be. And what's more, you'd be a sucker to NOT do those things at a table like that. (Unless you're trying to change the norms, which I'll get to later.)

But if the table establishes that backstabbing and bad faith bargaining is not accepted and will be punished (at least generally) ...then, again, that's now the norm, and you'd be a fool not to follow that norm.

One of the most momentous games in our table's long history was the game AFTER one player had blatantly backstabbed another for an advantage. The backstabb-ee had already established his meta style: 'I do not break deals; you break a deal with me, I fuck you'. The rest of us are a little more flexible, but this guy has been open and honest since forever that this is his move, this is his play. Every game, the moves he makes rely on this quid pro quo. He's even said to players who try and weasel out of agreements: 'I can't brook betrayal: if I do, the illusion is gone'.

Well, that player had no chance during the original game to make good his promise. So at the NEXT game, he came in with a plan to eliminate his backstabber...and he did. To great protestations from the backstabber, and while it was a little bit awkward, everyone understood the need to do it, and we all moved on from that experience by the next gamr. And we did understand the counterargument: 'don't hold grudges; don't warp one game based on the last; etc etc'. But the fact is, those kinds of norms easily create a world where backstabbing has very few consequences and everyone does it, and then you have to slow down and complicate the game endlessly with specific terms to your deals and binding/non-binding rules lawyering, all to just make sure of ONE THING: that the deal actually fucking works.

We still have the occasional backstab, it's just never for a pittance: it has to be really worthwhile. IMO, norming easy betrayals is more hassle than it's worth in an ongoing table, and our group likes it our way. That said, everyone at our table also has thick skin, so the kind of 'I will burn you because you have slightly inconvenienced me!' never happens. That kind of behaviour would probably make our rule untenable. YMMV."

That doesn't mean you can't prove something very, very close to 100%. Scientists of all kinds have various methods for running experiments and/or testing hypotheses in fields less hard than physics.

I mean, even the theory of evolution wasn't 'proved'in terms of running a rigorous experiment until we 'observed' evolution. (IIRC, they just proved it only a few years back with an experiment involving generations and generations of fruit flies.) It just kept matching and explaining observations so well that we decided it is so probably true that it almost MUST be true. A similar process of logical inference-making is what allows us to declare X 'leads to' Y in various social science experiments.

The Federal government does provide funding to firefighting efforts across the country, and according to a 2003 agreement with states it is supposed to fund various firefighting agencies on a dollar-for-dlllar basis with state spending. As just one example, the national aerial fire service was funded by this 50/50 split arrangement, but that fell to 23% on the Federal side. Money for that service could have gone to firefighting helicopters. And lo and behold, under public pressure to do something, ScoMo has remembered that he can spend money on more firefighting helicopters. He knew all along that he could spend that money: he just didn't want to. Because he's an austerity politician and he would rather cut taxes on the wealthy than pay for services for the rest of us.

The federal Liberal party WAS failing to pay its fair share, despite requests from state fire chiefs to do so. There are people who know very well what the Federal government did spend and should spend on firefighting, and their answer is 'not enough'."

Labor tends to remember it more (because they tend to like centralism); the Liberals tend to FORGET it more whenever they want to lie to citizens that they can't pay for this or that thing that people want (because that would mean taxing their core constituency - the rich).

If you're curious, Google 'vertical fiscal imbalance'. The tl;dr is that over the past century the Federal government has crept into more and more traditionally State areas of taxation, which has reduced the states to beggars asking the fed gov for the money they need to do all the things the Constitution says they have to do (at least, where the Federal gov didn't already step in...)

Also Google 'tied grants'. The tldr there is that the Federal government can and very much DOES give money to the states with instructions on how to spend the money, which amounts to federal spending in state responsibilities. This could be (and is) used to pay for things like firefighting. The proportion of federal spending in firefighting has fallen from 50% to lower than that - I forget the number.

(Fun fact: Labor promised at last election to raise federal spending back to the old proportion (IIRC) with $80million, partly to be spent on retrofitting old military helicopters into firefighting choppers. And training Oz firefighters in the new technique of 'smokejumping', which allows fireys to reach remote areas by chopper and stop bushfires before they spread. Their reasoning was that we currently rely on leasing private helicopters in fire season, but that is going to become much more expensive and difficult now that fire season here is overlapping with the northern hemisphere. And what did ScoMo do just now? Announced $20mil to lease four helicopters. It sure would have been nice to have had our own choppers ready to go already wouldn't it?)

This created all kinds of costs and benefits. It created immense amounts of human suffering, and it ripped rural communities apart; it also created capitalism - and all its mixed benefits - and the capitalist class - which is to say, people who make money from their money. This has had tradeoffs.

And the crazy thing is, after England's legal system achieved this throughout the 17th century, EVEN THERE, at the heart of the new system, tenant's rights began to emerge, because even those who most profited from the system began to see the immense costs of putting your workers on the street. To this day, tenancy law is one of the most controlled forms of contract law out there. Because history has proved you have to control it.

So claiming that it's as simple as 'don't protect renters' is just fucking wrong. There is no easy answer without tradeoffs, and only liars or the blind claim otherwise.
