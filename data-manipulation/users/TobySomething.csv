housing,ffsehmn,t3_euw3i7,1580179752.0,"I mean, yeah, tons of people do this.

Until I got married I was living in LA with an extra roommate in a partitioned off area of my living room.

My brother bought a property in Venice and there were like 10 people living in a 1-2 bedroom house.

When I lived in San Francisco I had to be off lease because it was restricted how many people were allowed to live in each apartment (even though we all had our own rooms, SF's restrictions are insane).

In terms of rebuilding your house, I think if you actually wanted to expand a single family home to fit the absolute farthest corners of your property, you would probably need a construction permit and it would likely be denied or you would get sued by someone in your neighborhood under CEQA, an environmental quality law that has been routinely abused to block construction that people don't want in their neighborhoods. 

Part of the new SB50 law that is proposed and will hopefully pass allows homes to be remodeled into 4-plexes as long as they are not torn down. But we will see, there is a lot of blowback from NIMBY groups.

Even if it doesn't, I think you could certainly cram a lot of people into a single family home - and people do - but many people who can afford a single family home to begin with don't want to cram a ton of people in there, and obviously doing so can create tensions especially if there aren't locked doors and privacy."
homeless,ffs1d5c,t3_eusodh,1580170754.0,"This is based on the common misconception that homeless people are shipped or flock to cities in California (or Seattle, or Spokane...) from out of town. 

In reality, the large majority of homeless people in California are local to the area, as is the case in pretty much any city with a large homeless population. [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/01/16/california-yes-homeless-people-your-town/4491325002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/01/16/california-yes-homeless-people-your-town/4491325002/)

Additionally, the failure in California in particular to create homeless shelters is part of the reason the crisis is so visible there. Numbers of homeless are similar in New York, but there right to shelter laws mean the vast majority of homeless people are in shelters, while in LA the opposite is the case: [https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-07-16/homelessness-los-angeles-new-york](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-07-16/homelessness-los-angeles-new-york)

Meanwhile, more people are getting out of homelessness in California than ever before ([https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-homeless-count-encampment-affordable-housing-2019-results-20190604-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-homeless-count-encampment-affordable-housing-2019-results-20190604-story.html)) - but the amount of people falling into it as the cost of living continues to climb is increasing at an even faster rate.

So is the solution to ship lots of people who are homeless in California out someplace in the midwest where they don't have family (or jobs)?

It seems like it's not addressing the root problem, and that it's not too likely people in the unnamed midwestern town are going to eagerly embrace a bunch of homeless people from California being placed in a federal housing project there."
todayilearned,ffrytrn,t1_ffrr8sn,1580169026.0,"Yeah. We need to actually understand the problems instead of casting around for easy villains. Access is not the problem, and barking up that tree does little to solve it.

This is only part of the picture, but this study's finding has stuck with me and rang true with my own experience. Part of the reason that low income families eat more junk food is that it is a reward that parents can give their kids to make them happy and to feel like good parents, despite having to continually say no to things like electronics or vacations. Meanwhile wealthier families can provide more expensive things, so saying no to junk food is not a big deal--and even makes them feel like good parents.

But I think that countering ""she likes the neighborhood the way it is"" with ""you can keep the physical look of the city the way it is, but it will still change, as is evidenced by San Francisco staying mostly physically the same over the last 30 years but vastly changing in character and problems. Maybe density is not really the most important thing to keep static"" is a reasonable counterargument, and the other appeals to concerns about climate change or social justice may or may not be persuasive depending on who she is.

Yeah, different people have different preferences, but they aren't carved in stone.

I would prefer to cut lines and never tip, but I recognize it's unfair, so I don't. I would prefer to eat pizza daily, but it's unhealthy, so I don't. I think people are capable of weighing preferences and values against each other."
yimby,ff7u1cb,t1_ff7rxv3,1579658352.0,"I disagree, but moreso I think people vastly overestimate the impact of new housing on their neighborhoods and quality of life. And they underrate the benefits of density. 

Paris is not known for being unlivable - it’s one of the worlds most beautiful cities. It is also smaller than San Francisco with several times the population. It’s nice to be able to walk to more stuff.

Making things denser doesn’t mean throwing up skyscrapers left and right. It can mean duplexes, fourplexes or even SF style Victorian row housing instead of detached single family homes. Most of these feared apartment buildings already exist in the neighborhoods people are trying to keep them out of.

If low density was the only thing that was important, why not live in farther flung suburbs or rural areas that are vastly cheaper? There is no shortage of medium density places in the US. There is a shortage of places with the opportunities of the Bay Area, nyc or other major cities - and pulling up the ladder after you get there is selfish. (Not that it’s just pulling up the ladder - you’re forcing people who were in out, and the door is always open for people who are wealthy enough). Meanwhile, there is no place in the US with the population density of popular areas of Tokyo, which are great places to live and visit - but nobody who might want to live in such a place has the choice to live in one here. 

Just about every place in high demand cities used to have fewer people and different buildings in it a century ago, and not a lot of people advocate for demolishing what we have to get back to that. We should be thankful cities were allowed to grow to accommodate us, and open to accommodating others. The fear is unnecessary."
yimby,ff78nqq,t3_es1cpv,1579643300.0,"Worth noting that you can keep a neighborhood physically the same, but you can't keep it the same. The case study is San Francisco: by trying to keep it physically the same and not build properties, it's become incredibly expensive, it's become one of the most unequal places in the country, with a homelessness epidemic, and many longtime residents forced to leave while artists and others who made the city vibrant cannot afford to move in.

If she is left-leaning, I might also appeal to climate change, immigration, or inequality. Having people live near their work is one of the best ways to cut emissions. It also makes life better for the people who work in the stores in your neighborhood, teach in your schools and patrol your streets, in addition to saving them rent. Also, if we are open to immigrants we need places for them to live, and if everyone wants to keep their neighborhood exactly as it is there's no place for them to.

Climate change and housing affordability are large-scale issues we need to tackle on a large scale; neighborhood by neighborhood action and veto power has not worked for decades and if you keep doing the same thing you'll get the same result. On climate change, California is the fifth largest economy in the world, and it can make a difference - but only if it acts together.

If they were right leaning (probably not being SF) I might appeal to property rights. Shouldn't you as an individual property owner have the right to build a duplex, modify your home, or sell it to a developer if you choose?"

I agree that Bernie proposes some ideas that are counterproductive. I do think it’s somewhat just to stake his claim to the progressive base; his record as a mayor was more pragmatic than his campaign proposals indicate, and he voted with Democrats on every major package that his vote was needed on.

centrist,ff3p3sl,t1_ff3hkl8,1579545818.0,"I would just add to that a caveat--building apartment buildings near jobs and transit is one of the best ways to help the environment, by reducing car commutes.

Meanwhile, while I can't speak to every part of the country, California's environmental quality act - CEQA - has become a catch-all to sue anyone whose construction you want to stop. 

I am fine with environmental standards, but they should be by right or at least with a standardized review. If you are following general guidelines to build an apartment building in a built-up city with a desperate need of housing, it is totally counterproductive to face the spectre of 2-3 years of lawsuits and reviews in the name of environmentalism.
