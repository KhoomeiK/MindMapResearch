I am happy for you for standing up for yourself."
TrueOffMyChest,fedut1e,t3_eodqoh,1579020352.0,That is fantastic! I really happy to hear this. Even a small step can make all the difference.
offmychest,fd9uols,t1_fd9u4zy,1578238301.0,"I agree. I got into that mindset that I had to save him and that it was my responsibility to fix him and make him better. I'm fighting that feeling because I don't think that's right. I know it's not my responsibility to fix him, only he can do that. And that's my fault that I allowed that. 
On another note, thank you! I remember your username and I find it amazing that you remembered my last post and have always left a comment of encouragement. It truly means alot."
offmychest,fd9s3xg,t1_fd9rqb0,1578237344.0,"I'm still going to counseling, my mistake if I said I stopped. I go once every other week as of right now. He stopped going because he didn't need it. But when he finally opened up to me he said that men are not allowed to show emotions so that's why he just buries them."
offmychest,fd9qyhw,t1_fd9oobp,1578236926.0,"I agree. At first he fought me about counseling, reserving it for only people that are depressed and suicidal. I'm going to counseling because I know I'm broken and need to heal."
offmychest,fd9qowi,t1_fd9pz1x,1578236807.0,"He told me the same thing: that I intimidated him and that he feels like he could never be as good as me. I feel like I've already lost myself but the friends that I do have are really helping me see the big picture. It's crazy, I never thought I would be in this situation. I have reached out to 3 lawyers as I want to see what my options are and next steps. 
He claims he will go back to couples counseling (we were going and he stopped going) so I really don't know."
