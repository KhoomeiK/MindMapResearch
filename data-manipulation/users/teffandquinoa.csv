dbtselfhelp,fcp41ru,t1_fbjt74m,1577849811.0,Well said. The group dynamic can help.
dbtselfhelp,fcp3nfc,t1_fbi4qlf,1577849465.0,"Re: therapists, even if she doesn't official DBT training, she may still understand the skills and be able to help you out. You could try discussing some of the skills you want to work on and she might be able to help you. I agree with you it's valuable to have a long-running relationship with a therapist--history is important."
dbtselfhelp,fcp1w24,t1_fbe3om8,1577847932.0,"I think u/calliewick made a number of great points, especially not to force yourself if it's causing you too much stress. In my own experience with therapy, my therapist tried to bring up what felt to me to be some very painful topics and I resisted it, but after seeing her for several years, we have revisited these same painful topics and I have been better able to address them and more deeply and with more clarity. I think therapy will test our comfort zones and it's good to be aware of our limits with how far we can go in any given moment. The greatest clarity will probably come with time, perspective and reflection. It's a journey."
dbtselfhelp,fcp1btt,t3_e7q4kn,1577847443.0,"This podcast has validated some of the stresses I'm experiencing including: seeing people you don't see that often (maybe once a year), feeling pressured to feel happy, traveling (airplanes), etc.  I feel like I've slipped into a holiday depression. I think in-laws can add a unique element to the holidays too."

getdisciplined,faw3q4c,t3_eafl3k,1576365528.0,"It's evolutionary for humans to think like this and be jealous, however it is not effective. Recognize that your brain is doing what it has evolved to do, but you're going to need to retrain it--meditate, listen to Tara Brach's podcast, read Kristin Neff book. You are going to need to rise above it through mindfulness, meditation, self-compassion, yoga (maybe?) and a lot of work on yourself."
