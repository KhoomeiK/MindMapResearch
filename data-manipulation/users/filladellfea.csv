You are completely missing the point.  Are you trying to say Krasner didn't do his job because the jury didn't find him guilty?  That makes absolutely no sense.  Maybe if Krasner decided to not pursue homicide charges against the bike messenger, you'd have a point.  Except that wasn't the case.  Krasner charged and tried the bike messenger for homicide.  A jury - who has nothing to do with Krasner's decision making - decided he was not guilty.

yes, copyright subsists as soon as you fix the work into a tangible form.  that said, enforcing that copyright without registration is practically impossible.  any competent IP attorney will tell you the first thing you do when taking a copyright claim is to register the work with the US Copyright Office (if it's not already registered).  that said, if the infringement occurred before you registered the work, you'll have to prove actual damages for that infringing conduct, which is *really* difficult and likely wont result in much money for a small time artist.  by registering the work, you get **statutory damages** that do no require proof of actual damages.  this is huge for the claimant and the infringer as a lot more financial repercussions will be enforced.  more importantly, a registration shows proof of authorship and publication of the copyright-protected work - which is required for succeeding in *any* type of take down, irrespective of monetary damages.  

a 5 minute Google search will support this and, because you clearly are too lazy to do one yourself, here's [a link explaining why registration is essentially required for enforcement of a copyright claim](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/faqs/registration-and-enforcement/).

edit: to apply this to what OP is doing - if someone asserts a legitimate copyright claim against OP based on his website for a poster that was never registered as a copyright, then the claimant would have to prove OP's website caused actual damages in order to recoup money (e.g., loss of sales).  there probably wouldn't be any actual damages in that case, and OP wouldn't really have any issues other than having to take down the protected works.  however, if someone asserts a copyright claim based on a registered work, then OP is automatically on the hook for upwards of thousands of dollars in statutory damages.

in both cases, the works are copyright protected - but the difference is fucking around with a registered work is way way way more dangerous as it pretty much guaranteed to create financial liability for the infringing conduct."
