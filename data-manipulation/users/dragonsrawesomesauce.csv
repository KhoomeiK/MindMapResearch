AskReddit,feyu741,t3_eqxk6x,1579450568.0,"I grew up in a Christian household, and I went to a Christian high school. I now consider myself to be a deist - I believe in God, but not in organized religion. There are a number of reasons:

* The rituals that are a part of many worship services are meaningless to me. To me it seems like at one time someone came up with the ritual, and I'm sure it meant a lot to that person, but I honestly don't think that God cares if you make the sign of the cross when you pray, or if you have your order of service just right, etc.
* A lot of religions tend to make people think that other ways of life are bad. I'm specifically speaking of homosexuality, transgender individuals, etc. Jesus taught us to love one another, not to hate someone because they (gasp!) love someone of the same gender as them. OMG, Susie is in love with Amy, it's a scandal!! Come one, people. Jesus wants us to love each other, not judge each other.
* Some people who claim to be Christians will pick and choose passages of the Bible to make their points, and blatantly disregard other passages based on how they live their own lives. You can't pick and choose what teachings to follow. This leads to a lot of so-called Christians being huge hypocrites.

Those are the biggies for me. I saw your comment that you wanted to use this feedback in your church reforming meeting. I hope your meeting goes well and that people are able to come up with some good ideas. Churches can do a lot of good within the community, but unfortunately some of the most judgemental people also come out of those same churches."

Second, for things like cleaning the litter box, make it a part of your daily routine. Like scooping it out right before jumping in the shower. Over time, this will just become a normal part of your day.
The training is a bigger issue. I'm not an expert on that by any stretch of the imagination, but I bet you can Google it to find some good advice there.

unfortunately, so many people undervalue what teachers go through and all the extra work that is needed to keep classrooms running smoothly. my husband was an elementary teacher, so i've seen firsthand all of the extra stuff he's had to do. it always makes me angry when i hear stuff like ""but they get the summers off"" - it's like dude, you try doing the job properly for just one school year, and you'll see that teachers both NEED and DESERVE that time off to keep their sanity while dealing with kids who don't really want to learn, parents who don't want to parent their kids, and an administration that doesn't support the teachers properly.

ok, sorry, i turned my suggestion into a mini-rant on behalf of teachers everywhere. didn't mean to do that. best of luck to you"

AskReddit,fcrz4c0,t1_fcrxqei,1577908734.0,"I agree with you. Back at the end of May/beginning of June, I decided I was ready to get serious about losing weight. I had a vacation in the second half off June, so I decided I'd start getting serious after vacation. No way was I going to wait another 6 months to get serious about it.

I used the time while on vacation to get my head in the right mindset for losing weight (something that's important for me), so in a way I didn't really delay, at least not as far as the mental aspect goes."

My family and I went through a lot that year with my husband having a heart attack, my daughters in and out of the hospital for mental illness, and my MIL passing away. I often feel like my son got ignored through all of that, which is one regret I have about that time, but we were all just kinda trying to make it through from one day to the next."

I can't remember the author's name. This was very helpful for my husband and myself. It might be of some help to you. Also, maybe get him into therapy, maybe a child therapist could help your son articulate his feelings better and help get to the source of the outbursts. Good luck!!!"
