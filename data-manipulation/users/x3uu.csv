Daylio,fezs4pn,t3_eqsm74,1579460944.0,I was one of the lucky ones one time for premium. I agree that devs must make a living for I side with many users on that point: Daylio doesn't have enough attractive premium features.

Bullet_Journal_iPad,fegc2v8,t3_ep10li,1579087084.0,"It's my first post here. I already have a physical bullet journal - which is pretty minimalist - but I'm very interested in doing pretty bullet journal pages not related to daily tasks so I can work on them them whenever I want. So I started something in Procreate: everything was made by me except for the dotted grid (which I took from a bullet journal website).

I tried Good Notes as digital bullet journal but there's few options foe drawing so I'm gonna stick with Procreate for now."
walkr,fegbmkr,t1_feer8j2,1579086487.0,"Also if you can't find anyone to launch an epic I can invite you to our current Bistro epic (have you unlocked it already?). We're pretty fast so you'll have your rewards in 1-2 days.

My Walkr name is Shuu Chuu, I'm gonna launch the fleet soon so just hop in if your interested."
walkr,feemuvm,t3_eohg3t,1579036964.0,"Andromeda is a nice lab with planets upgrading really quick (however it's currently full and there's a waiting list - unless I'm not up to date with the current lab state).

But really labs are very convenient to upgrade planets without spending all your money on it (knowing that upgrading the ship is costing more and more money). Also you're right if you're in a food lab with active members and no leechers your energy donation will be well invested.

Also the best way for you to collect cubes quickly is go run epics frequently (Bistro is a good one to get them quickly with short waiting time). I'm part of a team that runs epics all the time and I'm collecting cubes faster than before when I used to join public epics. So my advice would be to build/join a team with regular members and run as many epics as you need to collect the Flash ship."
