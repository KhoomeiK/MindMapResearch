I remember reading about doctors in a certain hospital would always prescribe expensive name brand drugs to patients because it was the default option in the computer systems drop-down menu.

funny,fciuqte,t1_fciluve,1577670282.0,I'm interested to see what those watches would detect when I play video games.  I pretty much had to stop playing the Souls games because my heart rate would go faster and seemingly harder than when I do intense cardio workouts.   I really didn't want a video game to kill me IRL.
