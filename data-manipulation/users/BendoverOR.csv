-*cracks can of worms*

So, this is a long story. I actually got started in lockpicking a few years ago because I'm a **MASSIVE** fucking nerd and got talked into playing a Live Action Role Play where my character had a lockpicking skill, but the catch was you had to supply your own lockpicks and *actually pick real locks* in the field.

So, I started picking locks as a hobby, mostly old Masters or whatever I could lay my hands on at work or at thrift stores. Then I got into this subreddit and started working belt levels.

After getting out of the Navy, I became a private security contractor. 10 years of that found me desperately searching for a new career.

My wife tagged me in a facebook post about a friend of a friend who was looking for someone with *some* locksmith and lockout experience but not much, so they can train. We talked a few times, and a week later, I had a new job.

I love my particular facet of this work. I have a company vehicle (2005 Scion xB) and I work on call most of the time. So, when I'm working, I'm working. When I'm not, I'm at home or doing whatever I want. Security work is a lot like fishing, you stand around for 8 hours, you catch nothing, you go home and first thing someone asks is did you catch anything. With this, I get a call, I go to work, I do the job, I go home, I play video games or spend time with my family until I get the next call.

Occasionally, I get to help out on other jobs, like back in August when I got to help install a CCTV system for a Coast Guard base (including microwave relays for IP cameras!), or last month when we got a job to redo ALL of the door locks for a small retirement home, including setting up master keys (15 locks total), but mostly I break into cars and houses. Some time in the coming months we're doing an even bigger job for the Coast Guard which will include installing a modern alarm system as well.

Honestly? I got started with a set of lockpicks off Wish.com. It was just a matter of investing the time, watching some youtube videos, and learning as much as I could on my own, then leveraging knowing people and being willing to learn every single day. I've never had a single day of professional instruction that wasn't OTJ training.

My boss got started apprenticing when he was 16 at a local shop. Its how a lot of folks get started. 

In my state, you don't need any proper training, just pass an online exam, and its an easy test because, well, lets be honest, its open book and you take it until you pass.

I would just call some local shops, see if they're hiring for apprentices. If you have some mechanical aptitude its easy enough work, its just about learning and attention to detail."
