It would have been enough for the little boy to be proud of his shirt and not teased, more than enough for everyone to just be kind and decent human beings. 

Why did it have to become such a circus?

Would anybody have cared about his homemade design if he hadn't been bullied? Would his t-shirt have become popular or would he have gotten a scholarship if the girls had just minded their own business? Is this kind of response going to somehow dissuade bullies from doing what they do?
