depression,ffcpt71,t1_ffcp63t,1579804660.0,"do you think im some sort of  naive happy optimist? do you think you are somehow wise because you are older? no im a pessimist and dont really believe in overall humans goodness and im mostly disillusioned with life.but im not someone who believes that love does not exist at all, people have unrealistic expectations of love but i would say love exists to some extent the truth is often not in absoloutes but middle grounds. the real reason you cant respond to my reosoning is because you have no good response you might secretely think im right but are too prideful to admit it."
depression,ffclsfl,t1_ffci7ev,1579802169.0,"geez where do i begin these are heaps of mental gymnastics that dont even adress my original point.

he is a shitty law maker at that
imagine an all powerful god getting offended when people kill themselves and dont worship him he must have a really fragile ego the only people that act like that are extremely narcissistic and selfish.

there are humans more merciful than him. infact he allows the suffering to persist. he dosent even need to create anything he dosent benefit from it nor does he benefit from torturing people.

i dont know any lawmaker that tortures people the worst kind of torture to ever exist for eternity on people who didnt do anything more other than disbelieve or kill themselves,comparing these people who commit serious crimes is idiotic. and he dosent even provide any evidence for his existance yet expects everyone who ever lived to randomly start believing in him how it come it always happens that the religion people are born too is the absoloute truth and all the other ones are false

. we dont live in the middle ages where people can be legally killed for not worshiping  a certain god.

'' and to grow up not respecting laws is idiotic'' thats what feudal lords and slave owners thought too thats what people who want weed ban think too laws are created by humans for other humans because humans are animals they change every now and then a law is not automatically good just because its a law. people who justify tyrannical power use your same reasoning.

''So while you respect the many laws of the nature I see people every day that don’t respect the law of God '' who said anything about respecting the laws of nature? nature is not a concious being.

religion is hive minded bullshit and the only way religious people can justify their belief that their parents brainwashed them with is massive amounts of mental gymnastics. which why i dont believe anymore as they often contradict scientific facts and reflect they mindset of the time they were created in and they provide no evidence that they are true.

religion has been used for 2 main things to explain things that humans cant explain because science wasnt as advanced and to control populations.


''even if you think that people are loving! Unfortunately love does not exist - love is an abstract idea that gives you an excuse to be weak'' 

i disagree while love is not what people expect it does exist, thinking it makes you weak is an asshole mindset no wonder you are depressed no wonde ryou are depressed when you believe in such a tyrannical god.

im glad i no longer worry i might go to hell because some imaginary sky daddy might get offended over petty stuff it definetly got some weight out of my chest."

depression,ff6zwym,t1_ff6vj1d,1579638330.0,because suicide isnt an easy process and not everyone has the right tools or maybe they are waiting for the right moment.
Doomers,ff6v2zx,t1_ff6t01n,1579635490.0,then by that logic you still want something. you either want somethong or dont. you dont really stop suffering either and spirituality is bs you dont develop jack shit other than pretentiousnes and just kinda exist. would rather be dead just imo thats my original point.

depression,ff40ulg,t1_ff3zlij,1579553094.0,"again you completely missed my point.

i repeat what i said because you seem to miss my point.

your copying what you said too.

people comitt suicide for a multitude of reaons depending on each individual and its not black and white. 

this isnt rocket science either ,youre not everyone you cant understand everyone and their feelings and their desires, some dont actually want to die some actually do. its not one 
dimentional.

there are many that ive heard say they wish they could push a button to die or dissapear."
