Eugene,fdcrrhx,t3_ek38xd,1578282455.0,"Too bad the city hasn't been able to properly secure the streets downtown.

Anybody who is interested should look into the history of various street gangs and mafias. Many of them started as community patrols in neighborhoods neglected by the police.

Community patrols kicked criminals out of their territory and developed a sense of ownership over such. Once the original problem was handled and original members of the patrols retired and were replaced by younger members with no memory of the group's original purpose, that's when real problems begin. 

From here it's only a very small leap to running protection rackets, after all they were already doing the protecting, might as well get paid. And you know the cops won't do anything, since their lack of action is the reason for the groups to form in the first place.
