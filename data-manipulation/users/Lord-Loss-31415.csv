If my gf got pregnant and I spent 10 years raising the child only to find out she cheated on me and it wasn’t my child, according to you I should be forced to pay for being cheated on. That’s not how it should work. She made her choice to cheat and now has to deal with the consequences, not me. The thing is, in my situation I probably would view the child as mine and with the way I feel about my gf right now, I would more than likely forgive her. That is my decision and mine alone to make but my decision is not another persons and should not be.

unpopularopinion,ff39gjo,t1_ff3806i,1579536818.0,"There is one big flaw in your arguments and that is that you are not taking into account that child support is a legally enforced action which is why I’m disagreeing. The fact is, someone who is not the bio father should not be legally enforced to pay CS, end of story. As to your questions, they are all from a moral standpoint. If a man sees the child as his then he can choose to adopt in which case they do become his in a legal standpoint. If he hasn’t built up a relationship with the child, he is under zero obligations to stay or provide support. As for your last question, I believe a woman lying about being on contraception should be considered rape in the same way that a man who removes a condom during sex with the other persons knowledge is considered rape. In the end tho it’s a difficult situation when the child comes into play. Should the man be responsible after being lied to? Some people would say yes it’s still his responsibility as it’s his child, others would say no assuming there was an option for abortion but she refused and therefore took away his choice while keeping hers. Really there’s no right answer as there is always two sides to the story. That is off topic tho, so the round up answer to this post is that no, a man should not be *legally* obligated to pay CS however he may be morally obligated by his relationship with the child. It is his choice alone."

FYI that only works for the racists. Telling me I’m racist isn’t going to make me one, no matter how hard you try. 

I should clarify I don’t get offended by mayo or cracker, I don’t see them as offensive in the same way as bbq isn’t offensive either. You can’t preach equality and then try double standard shit. Anyone can call me mayo all they want and I’ll respond with a sauce of my own, be that mayo or bbq. You can’t say “it’s just a nickname you can’t get offended” and in the same breath get offended by a similar nickname."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fdq38rx,t1_fdq340x,1578652701.0,Yea man I know it. Thanks again.
FragileWhiteRedditor,fdq376w,t1_fdq30v8,1578652637.0,Wow then I really don’t see how you don’t think it’s ok to respond with ok bbq when called mayo. I mean if you could give a logical answer I might even agree with you so go ahead bro.
FragileWhiteRedditor,fdq30mz,t1_fdq2ww0,1578652380.0,Ok bbq :-)
FragileWhiteRedditor,fdq2skj,t1_fdq2kqq,1578652064.0,But it is wrong to say bbq? You see the double standard or you blind to it?
FragileWhiteRedditor,fdq2qty,t1_fdpu1sh,1578651997.0,Good logical explanation instead of silent downvotes. Thank you Randy :-)
AskReddit,fdq2p7v,t1_fdpov6h,1578651933.0,Oof this was a while ago. I know it’s round but hypothetically if it was suddenly shown we were wrong all along what would happen.
FragileWhiteRedditor,fdq2kj2,t1_fdphyb9,1578651745.0,So it’s also wrong to say mayo then yea?
FragileWhiteRedditor,fdp3m6s,t3_emfpoc,1578619204.0,"Terrible name but I think we can all agree if there’s a fragilewhiteredditer there can be a fragileblackredditer. Obviously as long as both aren’t attacking the other race there shouldn’t be a problem should there.

Edit: oh apparently not? Anyone care to comment why or just silent downvote."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fdp2zj4,t3_elwl37,1578618772.0,"As a straight white male I can safely say I couldn’t actually care less if there is gay, lesbian, trans, black, asian or whatever on the screen. I don’t understand people who could get offended by what’s on their screen. Let diversity rain and we can improve as a people."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fdp251n,t3_emeyxb,1578618197.0,“White nigger”? What.
