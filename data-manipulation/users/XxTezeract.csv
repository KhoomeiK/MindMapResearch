VRGaming,fe6bs6e,t3_enxyl4,1578886416.0,"If you want to use one that is better for steam though you should get the Oculus Rift. It cost 400$ and you need an PC to use it, it’s also better to use steam games on than the quest. Also hope this help’s you OP!"
VRGaming,fe6bhbn,t3_enxyl4,1578886195.0,An Oculus Quest would be perfect for you. It cost 400$ for the 64GB version or 500$ for the 128GB version. You don’t need a PC for it all you need to do to set it up is use the oculus app. It is completely wireless unless you want to charge it while playing and there are a ton of games to choose from. You can also side load steam VR games onto it. If you are interested in getting an Oculus Quest then you should look up some videos on it and they can show/teach you how it works. I hope this helps you OP!!! Good Luck!!!
