funny,ffiie1r,t1_ffhagri,1579974593.0,It’s just so darn catchy. At least it isn’t baby shark.
todayilearned,ffidwik,t1_ffhy2jc,1579971546.0,"A highschool student may be able to do the math. But is in no way considered an expert able to explain the process to a jury. Same with a first year physics student. A professor on the other hand by definition has to have a strong grasp of their subject and be able to understand and explain the hows and whys of their subject. Not just that it works. 

That is the distinction. Plus. Doing trig based on a photograph does increase the complexity of the problem by a large enough margin that I doubt your average high schooler could complete it, let alone explain how they did it."
movies,ffi3cb8,t1_ffhkl6u,1579963878.0,I know for my self and many others at my school. FB was considered the lesser of two evils compared to MySpace Because you couldn’t customize it as much. It was felt by many of our parents that it was a safer platform without as much chance of exposing us to the terrible internetz. My parents at least look back to that and laugh at their own naivety.
classicwow,ffi2hjy,t1_ffh9omt,1579963150.0,"I have to laugh. About 2 months ago, none of our regular priests could log on for that weeks ony kill. So we pulled the one random dwarf priest that was attuned into the run. He was 56. And he got the second T2 priest helm in the guild. Haven’t seen one since even though we have two full groups that goes up to three for ony. That same priest ended up getting 3 pieces of tier and his eye later that week. Once all those priests came back from wherever they were hiding. There was quite a bit of cursing involved."
gaming,ff0flzs,t1_fezmlp3,1579468422.0,My high school youth group would get togeter and play halo 3 every week for an hour. Eat pizza rolls or something similar. Then spend a hour at least talking about whatever was the topic of the week. Worked great. Had a way to decompress from a long day at school and homework. Then sat down and had a deep conversation about our faith.
classicwow,fezmxec,t1_fezk0ja,1579459155.0,If you didn’t notice. The kill itself is not really what the post is about. It’s that there is even enough people left on the server to have a kill. Was a very public exodus there a few months back due to the atrocious levels wpvp ganking. It got to the point of there being more horde players in IF than there was ally. Which should never be the case outside of a very small case or 2.

videos,feydtm7,t1_fexuvf4,1579444225.0,Nah. They actually gained popularity around the same time. I do remember the confusion it would cause in class when one would be mentioned and a bunch of people thought they were mentioning the other.
classicwow,fermef8,t1_ferk53t,1579355748.0,This. Plus ease of use. Plus. Auctioneer or its predecessors has been around since at least BC since I first played. So it is a interface I am familiar with. TSM has more functionality and options. But you have to know what you are doing if you want to make any real use out of it.
todayilearned,fefz7tk,t1_feewj8c,1579070290.0,"I guess my point is that the specific days don’t mater. You don’t celebrate the life and resurrection of Christ on just those days.

Let’s put it this way. Do you truly care if someone misses your birthday by a week. Or just that you went out and celebrated another great year with friends and family. A date is just a human construct to help us make better use of our time. There is no commandment that you must celebrate Christmas on the exact day Jesus was born. Don’t even have to make a production of it like some do. Just reflect on his life. And that’s about all it takes."
todayilearned,feepdi8,t1_feejegk,1579038418.0,Know for a fact they do at my airport. There is a board that accounts for many of the hotels and other heavy duty tourist businesses in my area that pay for a certain number of flights to always come in to the airport. Even if they are practically empty. Pisses me off really. Because the airlines know how high the demand can get and still charge 300-600 dollars for a one way flight. They basically just print money when people use their airline to fly in or out of my town.
todayilearned,feekeq9,t1_feeem5q,1579035535.0,It honestly doesn’t matter when you celebrate Christmas. While I have known about the whole Christmas is on the wrong day thing since I was a kid. Try explaining that to several different businesses to let all your family members off on a seemingly random day in January instead of Christmas Day. The day you celebrate has no bearing on whether you are Christian or not. The celebration and ideals on display is what matters.
Showerthoughts,feai6aq,t1_feaelag,1578949048.0,"Exactly. Actually. What I found the most interesting portion of history(outside the vibrant mythology built on Greeks) was how slavery was handled in Ancient Rome. It was such a different system compared to the relatively modern system used in the americas just 200 years ago. It was actually about as civilized a slave system could be. People were encouraged to treat there slaves well. A slave could work his way to freedom and even buy his own citizenship. Slaves would often join the family they worked for as a full member of the household and they could even own a business or hold political office. 

Just always found it interesting that the romans even made something as bad as slavery better than many of their successors."
Showerthoughts,feacm9d,t1_fe7cjvo,1578947037.0,Have you ever read his works regarding his conquest of the Gauls. Actually a very interesting read. And a rather easy one to understand if your knowledge of Latin is limited to a couple years in high school. Whatever you may think of him as a person. Gotta respect his genius.
gaming,fe58adf,t3_ennron,1578866521.0,"Honestly Minecraft. The original pc Java version is very much worth a purchase. Not the bedrock edition from the windows store though. There is a huge nodding community that adds all sorts of features and mechanics to the game. Can make it as easy or hard as you like. 

It’s just as repeatable as you make it. And is great to play with friends and family or just solo."
gaming,fe4t5qd,t3_eno297,1578862555.0,You know. I can’t say I’m all that surprised really.
gaming,fe4dy2b,t3_ennt5r,1578858284.0,"While it definitely is not as busy as it was when it launched. Calling classic dead is a huge overstatement. There is still a large community playing it with many servers with more players than the original wow servers could handle. 

And really. Everyone knew it would be crazy for a month or so and then die down to a more reasonable level. I’m sure eventually there will be some server squishes to account for some of the lower pop servers. But overall. It is a thriving game."
gaming,fe4cqhm,t1_fe3gcnp,1578857931.0,"Exactly this. If you had a somewhat tech savvy person in the family who went to an old school radioshack. You would have a switch that would split those cables into multiple inputs. So you could have a ps, Nintendo, and vhs player all at once. My family took it even further. We had a GameCube, vhs, ps2, laserdisc, and n64 all set up on channel 3. Feel like I’m missing something on the list really.

Edit: Oh God. Now I’m remembering the cabling nightmare this led to."

gaming,fe44xi7,t1_fe434an,1578855812.0,"If they just gave us a working version on the ps4 or 5. I would be fine. I love the old insomniac platformer days and wish they would return to there two greatest series.

And on the remake. While not as good as it could have been. Still had a blast with it. More of that would be awesome."

wow,fe3ftvz,t1_fdyfepn,1578848885.0,It’s stuff like this that makes me appreciate retail. I may spend most of my time on classic. But I still enjoy exploring the world and finding all the weird and crazy stuff you can get in retail.
marvelstudios,fe2u6u7,t3_enhvv8,1578842894.0,This is pretty cool. Definitely a better level on the color gradient. I would recommend picking a different image for falcon though. It looks a little too blobish with that specific silhouette. Maybe one with his wings extended above him.
todayilearned,fe2s3d0,t1_fe0fkzj,1578842284.0,Just don’t. If I remember right. You don’t want to know.
classicwow,fe2l1t6,t1_fe2iqg4,1578839737.0,Considering I like to think my raid group is pretty competent and decently geared. Our best run was 1hour 45 min for MC with another 45 minutes for people to get to and clear ony. We honestly could have done better without a few stupid mistakes. That and people want to fly from darn to theramore instead of going through IF
classicwow,fe2jp20,t1_fe2j1ty,1578839191.0,For me it’s more being able to find that many people who can regularly raid that early. Almost my entire guild has full time jobs that can have some funky hours.
classicwow,fe2htkl,t1_fe1gqti,1578838448.0,"While leveling, put enough points into holy to pick up consecrate. Then put the rest into ret tree for leveling. You can DPS and heal comfortably with this setup. And if you know what you are doing. You can even tank with it.

Once you get into the 50’s. You can then respec and see what your endgame build might be. Fair warning. Many guilds will not want anything to do with you if you aren’t a holy paladin in endgame. If that is your eventual goal. Make that clear when joining a guild. Many people think of retribution being a meme spec. They don’t realize that leveling in holy or prof can be painful to do unless you have a dedicated group dungeon zerging."
classicwow,fe2btzs,t1_fe23xaa,1578836673.0,You should be able to get +7 damage easy enough. But honestly. Crusader is easy enough to get. Run 2 or 3 orb runs and you will be set on those. The rest of the mats shouldn’t be too expensive. Just be glad you aren’t a healer. Have to spend 6 essence of water plus the orb plus a bunch of other stuff to get healing power.
classicwow,fe2baom,t3_enmqdr,1578836467.0,My only problem with this is. Noon? Ouch. That is an early start. Especially since any decently geared and competent raid group should be down to sub 3 hours to full clear both MC and ony in one night.

classicwow,fdxfdis,t1_fdudzaw,1578768166.0,You are correct. But blizzard released the attunement quest yesterday so that people could immediately jump into the raid.
classicwow,fdxb0xg,t1_fds015i,1578767038.0,It’s actually not that bad. On kirtonos pvp yesturday. There was a good 30 minutes where the alliance owned the spawn. Enough time for 10 groups to get the letter.
classicwow,fdc1624,t1_fdblrpb,1578265095.0,Pretty high interest rate.
classicwow,fdbzdxp,t1_fdbp7l6,1578264237.0,"Charging for class services in a instance is silly in so many ways. Once had a lock say he wouldn’t summon anyone without a 2 gold tip per person. He was quickly kicked and we replaced him with a friendly mage shortly after. That mage sure was happy to win a orb from strat plus the rest of the loot he got. Made all three portals since we needed to split up at the end. And also handed out extra water and food before we split. A week later he joined our raid as a pug. The week after he joined the guild. 

The warlock ended up joining a guild that people refuse to play with."
todayilearned,fd9g6a2,t1_fd93jb6,1578232946.0,My local Albertsons in little old Wyoming is the only place in town worth getting fried chicken from. Most restaurants that might have had it on their menu have taken it off over the years because even the owners go to Albertsons when the crave hits.
classicwow,fd5rfcj,t1_fd4pn7g,1578180648.0,"Kind of doubt it. Releasing WC3, phase 3, and 8.3 on the same day would case one or the other to lose players. I expect it will probably be about two weeks after WC3 drops to spread it out at least a bit.

classicwow,fca8k9u,t1_fca8clh,1577564713.0,"Thankfully not in my guild. Was a post here in the sub about two weeks ago. When I showed my guildys it, even the hunters were cringing.

TheMandalorianTV,fca88e0,t1_fc9xb6p,1577564548.0,You know. I actually enjoyed cowboys and aliens for what it is. A stupid concept with some fun action. Plus. Mr. Ford getting to cowboy it up. Anyone going into it expecting it to be more than that was deluding themselves.
classicwow,fca656x,t1_fca33mj,1577563618.0,"Because no prio list leads to chaos. It may not be the meta. But it’s how we work. The mage blade being on our list is actually a compromise with spell casters so that healers don’t roll on the choker of the fire lord. Our class leaders got together and figured out a good compromise between each class so that each class has a fair chance at some loot. Mageblade is one of the best healing weapons for paladins for several phases. I want to say until AQ. Although I won’t say I’m exactly remembering that right. I don’t have a loot list in front of me at the moment. 

On the case of aurastone. It really hasn’t been a issue. I think we are down to one priest who still needs the eye. So usually they just pass on it. 

While our guild is by no means a bleeding edge of raid progression. We aren’t exactly a casual guild either. We have two raid groups with current content on farm. Down to 2.5-3 hours for a double MC/Ony night. We are close to getting our first hand of rag on our own merits without having to do shady and unreliable deals with other guilds. Oh wait. Hand of rag sucks for progression. So do ret pallys, which we have one each for our raid groups. 

We decided to play for fun. Not to burn ourselves out by nitpicking over  little loot details. 

Sorry about the rant. Just annoys me that the prevailing thought is there is only two ways to play WoW. Either as a hardcore raiding progression guild that tries to theory craft the crap out of the game or a super casual guild who can’t even get a ony kill in. There are gradients between the two."
classicwow,fca11pp,t1_fca0w9g,1577561282.0,People talk about ret or prot pally being meme builds. Feel like arcane hunter takes the cake though.
classicwow,fc9v33j,t1_fc9s9qc,1577558645.0,"As a pally. I don’t mind. What pissed me off was the hunter from a week or two ago with the freakin mageblade. Screw that guy.

Aurastone is actually not even on the paladin loot list for my guild. Mageblade is such a better option and hammer of grace is relatively easy to get. The mp5 on aura is great for priests still working on there benediction though.

Edit: Just to explain reasoning a bit. 

My guild uses a combo of loot council and rolling for gear. They leaders of each class got together and made a spreadsheet with each class and roll cross referenced with each drop in Mc and ony. Then they decided what each of those role class combos could role on each item. Like healers can’t roll on talisman or choker of fire lord(by the way. That is a good upgrade for pallys over the animated chain. Just not as good as it is for spell DPS). But pallys can roll on mage blade. Yes. I know this is not the optimal path for perfect raid progression. Everyone knows this but we don’t care. 

The second portion is when raid hits. We can roll on any items that match our MS position on the sheet. But we can only win one piece off that MS list each lockout. So no one runs home with a cauterizing band AND a mage blade. We also round robin tier pieces each week(ony is separate due to the shorter lockout and having only one piece of tier per class) And lastly. There are 10 or so pieces on the list that are free role for pvp or off spec. Everyone can roll on these items. Although if you wish to just vendor or DE the item. Your roll may be ignored in favor of someone who will actually use it. Again you can only win one item off this list. 

Theoretically you can walk away with up to 3 items in one raid night. Possibly more if it’s ony/Mc in one night and a particular tier set drops enough times to reset the round robin. Likelihood of this happening are slim. But still possible. Especially as more people get geared. We had one hunter get 4 pieces of giant stalkers, sinew, leaf, and a free roll in one week. They ended up passing the free roll item to someone else later that night because they felt bad that they were getting so much loot. But that was just how the cookie crumbles. 

Overall this system has worked wonders for my guild. Everyone has a chance to get upgrades. We are all excited for each other when someone gets a great roll off. No one has expressed that they were cheated out of a good piece of loot because someone is being favored. It is all in the luck. And with how fast gearing is going right now. A lot of items are being picked up without any real competition. Heck we have had to start selling things or DE them because there is no one new who can use them. 

This system is about as fair as I have seen in wow. There’s no real way to abuse it like a DKP system can be. And the loot council is as much at the mercy of the luck as the rest of us. Heck I have even joined the conversation on our BWL list that they are working on. 

I hope this gives a bit more context into my views. I know not all of the decisions made by my guild follow the meta being set by all the theorycrafters and competitive progression guilds. But we honestly don’t care. We have a system that works for us. It sends people home with loot. Fairly dispenses it with bare minimum of bias. 

This is not the full extent of the system used by my guild. We of coarse have separate rules for bindings and the eye. Ony head goes to physicals DPS before other classes. Attendance has a bearing on what levels of loot you can roll on so a unproven raider won’t take loot and immediately gquit. And a few others to try and avoid as much fuss as possible."
gadgets,fc9kft2,t1_fc5xy9x,1577553982.0,"While pretty anecdotal. Working at an airport, we had an idiot fly his drone onto the runway. It then got sucked through a jet engine of one of our flights. This grounded the plane while we waited 3 days for a mechanic to come in and check the engine. 

Best part is the idiot then tried to come in and sue the airport for destruction of property. You can guess the LEO’s response to that."
gadgets,fc9jc7x,t1_fc7wkqk,1577553514.0,"Work at an airport. They unload, clean, and load in about 25 minutes. Unless it is a truly horrible mess they go down the plane with a broom and just glance under the seats. They don’t have time to do more than that."
news,fc9bgs7,t1_fc8koax,1577550088.0,"Exactly. The only time when you can get away with shooting someone in your home without strong warnings being handed out first is if someone had already actively forced themselves into your property. Someone getting lost and pulling into your driveway or even walking up to your door is not an excuse to shoot them. As much as people talk about the loose gun control laws and liberal self defense and defense of property laws in Texas. Gun safety and proper use are actually heavily ingrained into the culture of the state. Even in more urban and liberal areas, gun safety is at least touched upon in school several times over the years. 

Now if they break into your house, ignore multiple warnings to leave your property, or come at you in a threatening manner. Then you have a right to defend yourself and your property. Each case would probably require an in depth investigation to make sure it was a real case of self defense and not some guy pissed at door to door salesman or Jehovah’s witnesses. But that is something that honestly should be pretty cut and dry for the vast majority of cases. Of course there will always be those outlying cases that require more effort and might be more ambiguous. But that would be the exception to the norm."
