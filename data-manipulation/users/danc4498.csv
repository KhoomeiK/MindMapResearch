neoliberal,fffrzom,t1_fffmkts,1579890520.0,"Oh, right. In that case, keep in mind she is the number 2 pick to a lot of the 31% who said ""depends on the nominee"". If Sanders dropped out, how many would then go to Warren with no Democrat as a 2nd option?"
neoliberal,fff88yq,t1_ffebcz0,1579878175.0,That's the opposite of what those statistics show. Her supporters will generally support whoever the Democrat is. Yang's supporters are the most loyal.
neoliberal,fff6qnj,t1_ffecs95,1579877124.0,"Keep in mind that Bernie brings in a lot of anti establishment voters who care less about issues and more about knowing the candidate isn't secretly owned by corporations. Many would never vote for a Democrat anyway.

That doesn't automatically make them a trump supporter. Those of us that see the 2 party system for what it is recognize the error in their logic, but that still doesn't mean they are ideologically aligned with Trump."

neoliberal,ffewyc1,t1_ffeup9e,1579868887.0,"Maybe it's just that I don't understand the nuances of this sub, but it didn't seam like a bad faith question. I had the same exact questions and was hoping to see genuine answers, but saw downvotes instead. That tells me there are no answers and y'all just want to hear agreements with your opinions. 

First, to the question. Sanders accused Biden of offering to cut social security and Medicare. As evidence, the link has the follow with an associated video:

> 7/The clip Sanders used to attack Joe Biden (below) was clearly taken out of context. Biden was offering to compromise w/ the GOP to keep the government open & balance the budget if they'd 'meet Dems halfway' but it was clear to Biden they had little to no interest in that. https://t.co/1ZSiuG2XSq

That video literally has Biden offering to work with the Republicans to cut those programs. He's negotiating, saying let's cut it 80 billion instead whatever the republicans want, but there's nothing out of context. 

So, all the downvoted comments in this thread seem to ask legitimate questions that are just being hidden at the bottom of the thread. 

To your other comment:

> The video was provided as evidence thay biden didn't want to cut Medicare, contrary to AOCs original claim, and the guy is pivoting to ask ""ok but did he say he'd increase it?"" as if that makes the original claim any less of a lie.

No, the video was provided as evidence of the below comment:

> No he talks about raising the cap and essentially making the wealthy put more into a program they don't need.

The video makes no mention of the above. In addition, it doesn't even mention that he won't make cuts to Medicare. Let Republicans take the house and Senate, Biden would likely agree to cut Medicare as he did before as a negotiation tactic. 

Even if you disagree with everything above, downvoting those comments in a sub like this comes across as burying your head in the sand."
