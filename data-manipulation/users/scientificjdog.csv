SelfAwarewolves,ffejb9n,t1_ffdghcx,1579850348.0,"Dude here, sometimes it depends on your tone or the way you phrase something. Tone just gets better with time talking to more people. Its good to compliment people who you aren't necessarily attracted to both for practice and just being a nice person. The way you phrased that sentence isn't bad, but it's a little long so your tone might slip. Short and sweet is great for when you're getting to know someone or just for a professional relationship. ""Hey nice hair!"" ""Cool shoes"" ""I love that tie"" ""Nice dolphin blouse""


And of course, some people just don't take even well intentioned compliments well. They might think you have bad intentions, or they might be having a bad day, or they might just be too judgemental. Don't let it get you down, just keep being a nice person :)


Edit: or they might not like compliments"

Edit: Probably use steam in their oven, combined with an egg wash and maybe even a butter finish"

HistoryMemes,ff47yk5,t1_ff47agt,1579557509.0,"""And one day we must ask the question, ‘Why are there forty million poor people in America? And when you begin to ask that question, you are raising questions about the economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth.’ When you ask that question, you begin to question the capitalistic economy. And I’m simply saying that more and more, we’ve got to begin to ask questions about the whole society…”
