sousvide,ffcib1v,t3_esvefs,1579800065.0,Ovens do not provide constant heat. Say you can set it at 135. Initially it's going to heat up to around 180 then cool down to maybe 110 or 120. Then it's going to repeat that cycle for the entire time you're cooking. Not going to be the same as setting a sous vide at 135 and leaving at that exact temp for hours.
Saxophonics,ffcga5u,t1_ffcd7t7,1579798822.0,"NO NO NO. Do not use any kind of silver polish on your horn unless you plan to take it to a repair shop, have it completely dismantled then chemically cleaned. The fine abrasives in the polish get into the hinges and hinge tubes/nooks and crannies then jam everything up. 

SOURCE: I worked in an instrument repair shop for 8 years. Saw many saxes and flutes seized up. Expensive repairs.

At that same shop we rented hundreds of music instruments to band students every year and had to clean them over the summer so they could be re-rented. To get under the keywork we used a cotton swab (Q-tip) barely dipped into a tiny amount of Lemon Pledge Furniture Polish. With a little gentle rubbing, it took most of the tarnish off. This was mostly for flutes as you don't rent silver saxes to beginners but it would work for your horn too. If there's a really bad spot you might dip the end of the Q-tip in a TINY bit of Tarn-X to get rid of the tarnish. Then you have to do the same with an tiny bit of water to dilute and rinse it off.

At jewelry stores and some hardware stores you can buy silver strips - treated paper to put in your case along with the horn that will keep the tarnish from building up. 

NEVER use silver polish on a woodwind instrument unless you know what you're doing and what kind of damage you may cause."
