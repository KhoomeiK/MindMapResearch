If you’re going to share a real story, include details that make it believable or if you’re making up a story, let us know beforehand. I’m the wife of an LEO and have many friends in the profession and have never heard of such a situation, yet they are rampant on here."

Teachers,fdcpik2,t1_fdclbv2,1578280784.0,Seriously?!! No. I would have been sooo pissed. It’s the last day of break. Let us enjoy it in peace. I’ve been having nightmares about going back for the past 3 nights. I don’t need emails to remind me of what awaits me.
Teachers,fdcp1f8,t3_ekkcws,1578280433.0,"Why must they remind us?!? We’re already dreading it, but getting the over enthusiastic group text/ Remind just makes us more depressed. I’ve actually been waiting on mine. It’ll probably go something like “We’re excited to start a new semester tomorrow! In that light, we’re going to wear jeans and our [school name] tshirts everyone was given at the beginning of the year! We hope you had a great break and are ready to start a new semester refreshed, reinvigorated, and ready to change our students’ lives!”  Idk. Something like that that is both overwhelming and annoyingly alliterative.  It might sound nice, but fellow teachers can probably read into the message. I.E., because we’re going to put you through hellacious torture during staff meetings tomorrow, we’ll allow you to wear jeans to compensate the discomfort you will be in during said meetings. Also, I hope you got 5 months of relaxation over your 2 week break, because it’s gonna be nothing but TEST PREP! TEST PREP! TEST PREP! And observations to make sure you’re getting students ready for THE TEST BECAUSE THIS TEST WILL DECIDE THEIR FUTURES AND THE FUTURE OF OUR SCHOOL!"
EntitledPeople,fdcnjle,t3_ekedhi,1578279336.0,"I’m sure you’ve had a bad experience or two, but I was a single mom of three boys and NEVER asked anything from anyone I dated. In fact, I supported one of my bfs, buying him clothes, a Keurig, dinners, groceries, and vacations to the beach (one for just the 2 of us with friends and one for both of us plus his son and my 3 sons).

aww,fcvqfzg,t1_fcvnw76,1578007779.0,"I am so sorry! Losing a fur baby is always so hard, and I can’t imagine how pregnancy hormones compacted that loss. I know there’s no replacing them, but hopefully the joy of a new baby and kitten helped alleviate some of the pain. My 10-year-old still cries about losing the dog he grew up with 4 years ago. For so long, we kept looking for her to gallop (not trot!) up to us when we came home. It was heartbreaking."

aww,fcvpdwk,t1_fcvo8ol,1578007099.0,"Lol. I love it when people resort to name-calling. It really speaks to your level of intelligence. Also, I did supply you with a link to a case of a baby being suffocated by a cat. And no, I don’t believe all memes, it was just a current reference that came to mind. My post was not meant to continue the idea that cats often suffocate children, nor was it to scare or shame the OP. My post was genuinely to express the common occurrence of parents-to-be and new parents to get a new pet around the time of a new baby being born, and the bond that is created between said child and pet. My reference to my fear of a cat suffocating my baby was my fear 15 years ago, so you do the math... definitely not a boomer. We already had health issues and a puppy, so me deciding not to get a cat until later was actually an educated and intelligent decision. Again, he was the best cat ever. Not sure why you’re trying to make me into a cat-hater or a spreader of misinformation."

aww,fcvme3h,t1_fcvjowc,1578005216.0,"But to be clear... again... when I said “that’s true,” I was referring to the non-toxicity of most cats’ feces, so I’m not even sure why you’re arguing about cats suffocating babies."
aww,fcvlpnw,t1_fcvkdke,1578004795.0,"I have never promoted the idea of a cat suffocating anyone. I just wanted to protect my baby however I could. Again, this was FIFTEEN years ago, before memes were even a thing and resources on the internet weren’t as available as they are now. But here you go... one of the first I ran across. I don’t know how me choosing to wait to get a pet until my family was ready is grounds for me making animals homeless. The reason animals are abandoned is BECAUSE people aren’t prepared to care for them.

aww,fcvl2z5,t1_fcvh23d,1578004402.0,"We lived on a military base where pets were absolutely not allowed outside unless on a leash or in a fence. 

1) Cats generally HATE leashes (as did ours). 
2) Cats can jump over standard fences (which we had).
3) Where we lived (Arizona), we were counseled by the animal shelter to NOT allow cats or small dogs outside due to the occurrences of smaller animals being grabbed by birds of prey. 

When we left the military, the cat was allowed in/ out at his choosing."
aww,fcvk7ow,t1_fcvjowc,1578003862.0,Dude. There are actual documented cases of cats suffocating babies. There’s even a current meme of a woman realizing she couldn’t breathe at night because her cat was lying on her face while she slept.
aww,fcvjkcq,t1_fcvi0z8,1578003459.0,"I didn’t repeat it. We didn’t get a cat until my son was 4. When I said “I know better now,” I was referring to now knowing that not all cat feces are toxic. We also always made sure my son’s door was closed when napping/ sleeping until he was older just to ensure the cat didn’t get in. The few times he did, he just snuggled up to my kid or laid at his feet. And I have never abandoned a single pet in my life. I was just a paranoid mama. There’s no reason to not be careful. This was also around the time that SIDS became a big thing and the best sleeping positions for babies seemed to change every month. If you’re a parent, you have most likely put your fingers under your child’s nose or stared intently at their chests while they’re sleeping to make sure they’re still breathing."
StoriesAboutKevin,fcvhjrm,t3_eimuqh,1578002226.0,"I’m a teacher and absolutely DO NOT expose my already awkward, anxious, and stressed high school students to that. Did it once in my first year (because that’s the type of crap they teach prospective teachers in college, not the real stuff like dealing with shit-head kids, parents, and admins). It went pretty smoothly, although I noticed some kids absolutely refused to take part. Had a similar experience not much later with school faculty and I totally get those kids who didn’t participate. I hate the stupid/cheesy get-to-know-each other or faculty-bonding games. Especially the “share one positive thing you’ve experienced this semester” crap. Dude, I teach high school students. I don’t experience much positivity!"

aww,fcvf6t2,t1_fcvdr71,1578000823.0,"That’s true. I had heard too many horror stories of cats suffocating babies, and about how toxic cat feces can be for pregnant women cleaning out the litter box. This was 15 years ago. We did get a cat later. Best cat ever!"
aww,fcvaflc,t3_ej1u74,1577997997.0,"What is it about being pregnant/ having a baby and getting a new pet? I did it with my 2nd child. Got a puppy the week before he was due. Occasionally regretted it (caring for a newborn and training a puppy at the same time was sometimes overwhelming), but they grew up together and were so close. It broke my son’s heart when we had to put the dog down after being run over."
funny,fcva22v,t3_eizvzy,1577997778.0,"My son is 15 and in the Civil Air Patrol (basically JROTC for the Air Force). Due to growing up with a dad in the military who also loves to pester the sh*t out of people, my son is the record holder for keeping his composure the longest in his squadron. It’s funny to watch the kids break over stupid jokes, stunts, or simply being stared down."
Dentists,fcawmab,t1_fcatb2h,1577578063.0,"Thanks for the info. I have to do an online smoker’s program each year for my insurance, but it seems like it’s created by non-smokers who don’t understand the struggle. I don’t want to do any of the meds available because I’m small and most meds are too powerful for me. Plus, I’ve heard of terrible side effects, which I’m sure I would have. I just need to dedicate myself to quitting. Almost did once, before we took our kids to Disney World, because I didn’t want to have to sneak to a smoker’s corner and miss out or delay everyone else, but the anxiety of being in such large crowds didn’t help. Tried the gum in line for a ride at Disney; it almost closed up my throat completely. So I know I just have to do it on my own, which has been done millions of times before. Just have to find the right motivation. Again, thanks for the info and encouragement."
Parenting,fcapzvu,t3_egsxcc,1577574280.0,"I’m almost 40, have 3 sons and a step daughter. My oldest son is a freshman in college. I have a BA, a MA, and working on my 2nd MA. I teach high school students, participate in professional committees, and keep up the house. I’ve somehow raised 3 incredible boys. There have been MANY times that I still feel like I’m unqualified to be a parent or in my work position. There are still times that I feel like I’m in my 20s and completely inadequate and immature. (The immature part might be from spending most of my time with 15/16 yos.)

I had my oldest son when I was barely 20, so I can tell you with no doubt that I wasn’t ready. I was barely out of my parents’ house and was used to my mom doing everything and practically waiting on me and my dad, always offering massages, doing most of my laundry, etc. I was definitely spoiled, but also knew how to do household basics. 

When I moved out with my then bf not long before my first was due, things were so difficult at first. I couldn’t keep up with everything while working full-time. I felt like a failure. The thing that kept me going was my bond with my son. He had his issues as a baby, but especially since I nursed him for a year, he was my anchor. Nearly 19 years later, he still is. 

Just know that this is a season. It WILL pass and the older your baby gets, you will feel more connected with your child and more confident in yourself. Parents always doubt themselves, especially in the difficult situations. That is totally normal. Sometimes I still feel inadequately skilled or prepared for situations with my kids (18, 15, 11, and 10), especially since they are all so different. 

Keep your head up. This is normal. The self-doubt, insecurity, and fear will probably always be there, unfortunately. But that means you’re trying your best and want to do better. That is the sign of a good parent. Take a deep breath, tell yourself you’re a great parent, and love on your baby. That’s the best any parent can do."
