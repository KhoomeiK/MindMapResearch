Also if the bunny is just sitting in the cage all day that’s no life for it, which is what I feel like is happening because if your sister is only interim the cuteness I can’t imagine the poor bun is getting any exercise, proper nutrition or outside time. Maybe go over to r/rabbits for more advice, but don’t try selling or just giving the rabbit away to anyone because that usually ends in the rabbit being fed to another animal, there are places you can give your rabbit up to for a small fee or for free. When selling it is usually recommend to have a fee of about $50 or more because people aren’t going to pay that much for one meal for their animal which weeds out people who are just looking for their animals next meal and shows who knows about rabbit pricing and selling and who is actually knows something about rabbits."

I don’t think we can tell that she’s extremely mentally ill just because she photoshopped, does she have a little body dysmorphia, maybe but we can’t say for certain.
