The building was created between 1966 and 1970 by the collaboration of the architect Walter Schrempf and the sculptor Otto Hajek.
The Saarbrücken university canteen, which has been a listed building since 1997, is today regarded as a globally recognized example of the brutalist era, which combines architecture with spatial art.

The sculptural means of Hajek, sculpture and color, dominate with the exposed concrete of the facade. He clamped inside and outside space, surrounding space and rising plastic with so-called ""color paths"": strips of color that ran over the plastic and laid an artificial reference system over plastic and surrounding space. 

The plastic was meant to become the “whetstone” of one's own consciousness, which had a dialog-triggering character. Hajek was concerned with the right to participate in public space.

As Hajek said: ""In our environment there is space. We are in it, it is brought to life through visual work, as a finite space that surrounds people, tangible for encounter. […] The senses must be sharpened for perception in all areas. To understand in the real sense of the word as a space of thought and as a lounge. """

As a child you learn and discover new things every day. The older you get, the more you get used to everyday life and you're less impressed and excited by small things.  As an adult, days often run the same and you have your daily routine, so time flies faster."

AskReddit,fd9h0ri,t3_ekcccc,1578233208.0," I've been wondering that for a long time and i think it's because you hardly experience anything completely new as an adult. 

As a child you learn and discover new things every day. The older you get, the more you get used to everyday life and you're less impressed and excited by small things.  As an adult, days often run the same and you have your daily routine, so time flies faster."
