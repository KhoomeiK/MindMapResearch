facepalm,fgtrbgi,t1_fgtqnoz,1581108351.0,Hey fair enough for being consistent then:)
facepalm,fgtqkoj,t1_fgtp5md,1581108099.0,You’re incredible disingenuous comparing India to the western world. Why do you think fast food is so affective and that the lower class eats there instead of healthy groceries?
facepalm,fgtmddd,t1_fgtljvo,1581106434.0,Ultimately you’re saying how you justify it is fine but if other justify something different than you they are wrong. I got it man. Keep living the hypocritical life
facepalm,fgtl5d2,t1_fgtkji7,1581105890.0,You could just move though an not harm the creatures right? You’re asking to give up my fundamental diet. How is this any different? Just because you justify it out doesn’t change it. If you had a huge infestation you could move which would inconvenience you but let the creature live.  But you’re choosing death to them so you don’t have to be inconvenienced. Tell me how I’m wrong there
facepalm,fgtkfu2,t1_fgtk4qc,1581105709.0,You said this is what you morally believe in your opinion. I’m asking what gave you the right to decide these morals? That was the same question you asked me and my answer wasn’t good enough for you. I’m asking how you have the right to decide that as a human that a lesser creature deserves death got causing issues in your life. I read it perfectly fine.
facepalm,fgtjah2,t1_fgtj2wa,1581105239.0,What gives you the right to decide that? You’re killing a creature. Do their lives not matter now? You saying you wouldn’t get an exterminator if you had a roach infestation?
facepalm,fgthnb2,t1_fgtg9at,1581104535.0,“Love how you glaze over the whole comment” damn man you are full of hypocritical comments. Personally I’m still waiting how anything I’ve said is different from you a Dominant species deciding things for lesser species like keep pet and killing pests. Just admit you’re a hypocrite and I’ll leave it be. If you can admit that to me then at least you know you are one and this can be done.
facepalm,fgteu7n,t1_fgtds9s,1581103574.0,"Ya I don’t care about your pity party. I won’t change my food tastes if there isn’t a perfect replica. My personal happiness matters the most to me. But you have a 1D view of that. What makes me happy is my family being happy. What makes me happy is pushing forward a world where everyone can be equal. What also makes me happy is eating the food I enjoy eating. Just because I don’t agree with what you agree with isn’t me not wanting to make the world a better place.

Going after dirty energy is far an above more  important than people eating meat and ya using animal products."
facepalm,fgtcyqk,t1_fgtcva4,1581102818.0,There’s other ways we can help the world than eating animals you realize that right? You just don’t like that I don’t agree with you and you’re malding over it.
facepalm,fgtamri,t1_fgtahcv,1581101763.0,Aww nice try. Im at the young end of millennial. But I know it’s hard to argue when your entire logical tree falls down and you realize your argument is shit. You’ll get em next time :)
facepalm,fgt9qdy,t1_fgt9hg2,1581101460.0,"How am I selfish? Lol I’m not the one trying to dictate what other people do based on my preferences. That would be you. You know what I do advocate for. A world where all races and genders can live in a world on equal footing. Animals however, how is it selfish to care about an animal. Do you let termites live in your house? Do you kill roaches and such? Damn that’s pretty selfish of you by your own standards. You a dominate species killing less species that bother you, 

The problem is you’re a hypocrite but you aren’t even sure why."
facepalm,fgt9fit,t1_fgt9bqg,1581101290.0,I want to to argue that. Why should I care about a reality we don’t know? Why should my personal preference not matter?
facepalm,fgt9987,t1_fgt8f90,1581101191.0,Are you actually trying to get me to care about the planet hundreds of years from now? You’re saying we should lower our personal enjoyments now for the a future concept that might happen hundreds of years after you and me are dead? That sounds like a really hard argument to win on your part buddy.
facepalm,fgt8sa9,t1_fgt708b,1581101082.0,Ya I’ve looked into this. What you’re talking about at a price point is only true when talking about an individual. Once a full family is included in that process the metrics change to meat being a much cheaper option. You can say taste is subjective but it’s not a dumb argument when it’s what I want. You keep taking this argument like the life of an should matter more to me than say the life of my car but it doesn’t. It’s utility. Your arguments are invalid at that base level. You can never change my mind on that simple fact.
facepalm,fgt6kcv,t1_fgt66od,1581100102.0,"1. Sure that might be what they used for Africans but I don’t think it applies. There’s no difference between a black guy and white guy at a fundamental level ignoring things like privilege but on a base level they should be seen as the same.

2. Sheep, cattle, chicken etc are not like humans. They can’t enter into a social contract with us. They will never do anything else for us. If they had the option to, they would kill us on the spot if it was for the betterment of their lives. We just happen to be the alpha predator."
facepalm,fgt5wfr,t1_fgt5imq,1581099707.0,"1. It doesn’t taste anywhere near the same right now. Most of the world enjoys eating meat and it’s a very good cheap option for a lot of poorer families as a vegan diet right now can be expensive. 

2. I really don’t care what some people it as. Animals are utilities for us to use. I don’t believe God made these animals. I think they’ve evolved over time as a resource for us to use and that’s what I’ll continue supporting.

When we have a lab that can create everything for us that 100% replicates every aspect of what animals give us then I’ll agree with you. But we are very far away from that so as it stands whatever. I don’t see an animals life as more important than losing things I enjoy."
facepalm,fgt5de1,t1_fgt57bg,1581099393.0,The grounds we are the dominant species and decide these things. You gonna have this same argument if a vastly superior alien force comes in and enslave us? I would bet no you’d fall in line instead of dying
facepalm,fgt4spt,t1_fgt4hup,1581099050.0,Ya sure. Are you a vegan? If not then you’re okay with the rape and forced fattening to death of animals for their products. The answer is we decide it. Would you let your pet run away if it wanted to? I guessing no because it’s literally your slave you get enjoyment out of. I love my pets as well but it’s no different than how I love my car. If a pet didn’t give me joy in having it or it was a huge burden on my daily life I wouldn’t have it the same I wouldn’t have a clunky issue ridden car.
facepalm,fgt46t8,t1_fgsq7n3,1581098687.0,I’m saying it’s okay. Animals are utility to us the dominant species. If an alien race that was superior to us came and did the same to us oh well.
facepalm,fgt43bf,t1_fgswugq,1581098629.0,Fuck no it’s not. Just like cows and chickens we are breeding them to serve a purpose for us. It’s the same damn thing. There’s no issue here at all
pussypassdenied,fg4qsz9,t1_fg4qimg,1580509059.0,"I feel like you’re genuinely dense. Of course you don’t check everyone randomly walking in. In these communities you generally know each other. Friends of friends are like oh I know X in condo 7. Or you see people walk in with others they know. But in this scenario and ones I’m talking about and any rational thinker would is it’s at night, no one is with this person she obviously doesn’t recognize and he isn’t coming in with his own equipment he wanted for her to open the door so he could go in."
pussypassdenied,fg4q7ol,t1_fg4q055,1580508678.0,Hmmm maybe that’s why you ask people trying to enter the door without the proper equipment to get through it like idk a fob if they have one. If they refuse to show you like a decent person would because it’s not an uncommon question in environments like that then hey that’s suspicious.
pussypassdenied,fg4psol,t1_fg4pn7e,1580508412.0,You 100% can stop people from being somewhere they are trespassing on. You’re joking right?
pussypassdenied,fg4n3ib,t1_fg3s049,1580506740.0,You’re taking out your ass right now. Depending on MULTIPLE things what you’re saying isn’t true. In some Strata based condos I’ve lived in we had every right to make sure someone wasn’t where they weren’t suppose to be. The building was very friendly and community based so people would leave furniture and bikes/scooters outside their doors all the time. My current situation is the same but in a building where you have to access it with a fob to get on the higher flooors. Myself and many others have every right given to us by the apartment staff to stop and question people and call security if we think they are accessing the floors by following others up.
LivestreamFail,fg0yj9h,t1_fg0j3lc,1580417540.0,"There’s so much misinformation here’s its kind of ridiculous. But I know like all the dick riding hate trains here you won’t care. If anyone is interested though he is 

1. Not a bad dad by any stretch of the imagination. Lots of projecting going on there. A divorced parent moving states to increase their job performance and income is not that uncommon but I doubt you know that. However it is uncommon for a dad that does that to make bimonthly trips to see the kid and provide a upper middle class salary to the mother (of which he isn’t married to remember that) of the child so that the kid gets everything he needs and wants in his life. 

2. There is no evidence and not even a credible source of him sexting underage girls. The story this person is spinning his own way is that he was chatting a girl who sent him a swimsuit pic of herself from Facebook and when she mentioned her age he stopped the chat. There IS logs of this. 

3. The man dropped out of college not because he couldn’t keep his grades up, he did it cause the job he was currently doing at the time was paying him a lot and he got enjoyment out of it so he decided to pursue it as a career. Again man you write this wall of text without evidence or even an actual idea of the facts. 

I get you hate destiny that’s fine. But you can hate him for real reasons and not all this projection and falsification

Edit: checked his YouTube stats and his demographic is quite old for a “video game streamer” so that’s a weird attack as well."
2007scape,ffuugb9,t1_ffurwsb,1580249555.0,I really appreciate your advice I’ll be adding these tips to the others that have offered advice as well.   Thank you :)
2007scape,ffuln3d,t1_ffulc7m,1580244567.0,I really appreciate this thanks! I’ll take these tips and see how it goes :)
2007scape,ffuljk8,t1_fful3g1,1580244505.0,I appreciate the respond. Even at half a level a day I think it will still be reasonable time wise. My Ironman is my first real character and 64 is the furthest I’ve ever made it in slayer. Hopefully these tips will speed me up a bit.
LivestreamFail,ffqjhra,t1_ffqiy61,1580136307.0,Found out shortly after I posted it. Deleted the comment thanks!
PresidentialRaceMemes,ffgilv8,t1_ffgigt7,1579907074.0,Nice cop out :)
PresidentialRaceMemes,ffgi8kg,t1_ffgi6gb,1579906829.0,Only one person here assumed I was talking about a sex. You can back peddle now but people like you are why Trump will win again
PresidentialRaceMemes,ffgi49q,t1_ffgi1z9,1579906752.0,Are women not allowed to be bro’s? Damn that’s your brain on populism coming out strong my guy.
PresidentialRaceMemes,ffghzo1,t1_fffv2mg,1579906669.0,Or Bernie bro’s are a cancer in this country.
LivestreamFail,ffe8uyy,t1_ffe8haj,1579839884.0,"It's even easier to get an 80k tech job in somewhere like Tennessee where the cost of living is WAY less than New York. If you compared 200k in newyork to  80k in lets says nashville, that 80k goes a lot further when you factor in cost of living and what you pay in taxes on that 200k in NYC."
LivestreamFail,ffe82ae,t1_ffe22o1,1579839236.0,"You aren’t factoring cost of living. I make enough in my city that it would be the equivalent to 200k in New York. Making more in those cities means you pay more taxes and spend more money on basics. In smaller cities you can make less but afford more, be in a lower tax bracket and still have the night life. Idk why you are dick riding living in a major city so bad but it’s weird"
terriblefacebookmemes,fenfvnv,t1_fen64t3,1579283806.0,This is you’re not knowing how much power and pull this specific general had. Dude orchestrated more than any other current individual foreign threat in that region. Stop spreading misinformation he was planning the deaths of US soldiers and had his hand in multiple deaths already. He won’t be as easily replaced and thinking he can be shows your misinformation or lack of information about who he is and what he did.
terriblefacebookmemes,fenfnp9,t1_fen3lcl,1579283669.0,Almost everyone “good or bad” in the Middle East has fought isis this doesn’t mean he didn’t “deserve” to be killed less. Dude was a huge threat to the US foreign affairs. I love people underselling how much this guys pull was compared to other leaders
terriblefacebookmemes,fenfhsr,t1_fen44wr,1579283570.0,"I think what you’re saying  is bullshit in this scenario. Unless I misunderstood what you said, killing Solemain wasn’t just like a hydra head like others in these regimes. He was of great importance and had a ton of pull and power in that region. Someone may follow him but just saying any new general can fill his shoes is underplaying how pivotal he was in that region."
TumblrInAction,fdpfmir,t1_fdopy6b,1578627371.0,I would like to know why you disagree?
TumblrInAction,fdh8grf,t1_fdh8duo,1578417659.0,Makes me sad that people like you vote.
