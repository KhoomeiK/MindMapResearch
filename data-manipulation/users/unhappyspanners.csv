rugbyunion,fguqi0f,t1_fgu3vln,1581127090.0,I can’t imagine the scenes in Saracens admin departments this season. It must be hell.
rugbyunion,fguatr6,t1_fgu9jwe,1581116366.0,Bet Japan replaces South Africa.
rugbyunion,fgu5qyu,t3_f0hr3z,1581113802.0,Oh that makes me sad
rugbyunion,fgu1v0b,t1_fgu1h7t,1581112227.0,"Not really. One was never included in their European registered squad. The other was, but his work permit expired the day before. It's since been sorted. Saracens themselves reported it apparently."
rugbyunion,fgu0jtm,t3_f0h5nv,1581111789.0,"This is going to be a reasonable, calm, thread."
rugbyunion,fgtyd73,t1_fgtxva8,1581110985.0,I hope it goes well for him!
rugbyunion,fgtxe8v,t1_fgtw4te,1581110627.0,"He's class. I think he was with the Italian Rugby Union, so hopefully he starts getting some European or Pro14 games."
rugbyunion,fgttdmw,t1_fgtsnmc,1581109017.0,How? He slapped the arm and not the ball
rugbyunion,fgtrkq5,t3_f0bvwf,1581108466.0,"So many offences missed. No release, side entry and playing the 9. Scottish turnover and they almost get a try from it."
rugbyunion,fgtr89t,t3_f0bvwf,1581108307.0,Lmao ref that was so far in the side!
rugbyunion,fgtpo4t,t1_fgtpfp0,1581107719.0,He was beaten every scrum last game. He just seems poor.
rugbyunion,fgto5mq,t3_f0bvwf,1581107194.0,Lmao at the gap at the lineout. Can't compete when it's 2m wide and they throw it straight to their man.
rugbyunion,fgtn4bz,t1_fgtmm50,1581106818.0,The English tighthead is pants.
rugbyunion,fgtlynj,t1_fgtlmsc,1581106356.0,"They've dominated the scrum but been beaten in physicality in open play. I feel Scotland have been rarely onside, so probably fair to leave that as is."
rugbyunion,fgtkjkj,t3_f0bvwf,1581105767.0,"Scotland have won every scrum, but they walked that one around..."
rugbyunion,fgtk6s8,t3_f0bvwf,1581105569.0,"Scotland ripping the ball when the guy is on the ground, no penalty?"
rugbyunion,fgtk2ho,t3_f0bvwf,1581105499.0,"Honestly, hook Beaton off. He's getting torn a new one in every scrum and losing us ball."
rugbyunion,fgti6aq,t3_f0bvwf,1581104824.0,Theo Dan looking like a great find. Shame he's going down with Saracens.
rugbyunion,fgthvtb,t3_f0bvwf,1581104673.0,"Seriously, did they rope a 17 year old into playing tighthead? He's getting rinsed."
rugbyunion,fgtftmn,t3_f0bvwf,1581103941.0,England tighthead proving to be the weak point again. How'd we go from Painter and Heyes winning almost every scrum to this?
rugbyunion,fgpnrnj,t1_fgpnmrt,1581008494.0,"I'll defer to your, and other Francophones, judgement on this matter!"
rugbyunion,fgpm4fy,t1_fgpln5p,1581007565.0,"Help with refs who primarily speak English. English speaking refs were told to learn more French to accommodate French speakers, but I have doubts about the standard of French spoken."
rugbyunion,fgpjukn,t3_ezue34,1581006249.0,I was watching the u20 JWC last year and Vincent really impressed me as the captain. It must help to have someone who sounds almost like a native English speaker.
