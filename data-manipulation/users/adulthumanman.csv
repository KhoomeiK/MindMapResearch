tennis,ffjlcy3,t3_etwr28,1580000892.0,40 percent of my data is spent on Reddit. About 10-15 gigs a month.
tennis,ffjdq6g,t1_ffj1l5u,1579996118.0,"So on The instagram, which is an app on the smartphone, Dolly Parton posted a picture which went viral.  Not like corona virus but something that is immensely popular and spreads exponentially like a bad virus. That’s all I got for you boomer. 

One last thing the instagram is on the internet."

tennis,fffyzpa,t3_etbyuq,1579894880.0,I was totally surprised by Federer’s negative thoughts when trailing. He mentioned he was thinking about press conference and explaining hours loss.
tennis,fff308y,t1_ffeh1u1,1579874325.0,He is last gen. And he just beat millman in 5 set tie breaker.

tennis,ff8xz4k,t3_es6i4d,1579699692.0,"So I watched the game on ESPN and my first thought was about misusing medical timeout. But then then talked about how her serve average came down from 175 kmph to 155 kmph.  So I don’t think she was misusing the timeouts. 

BUT I did notice she was looking towards her box and looking for answers. They didn’t really show the box responding but looked shady."
tennis,ff5xf5k,t3_ert4o0,1579613429.0,Yes. This is a great move.  Even if he doesn’t win he’ll know he gave his everything and it was not good enough. Which means he has to try to get better everyday Instead of just relying on his talent.

There is no reason to hate it other then rare downtimes. Most of the issues are user configuration errors."
nfl,fetf8me,t3_eqhgee,1579374849.0,I was at the last one. Last game in Georgia dome. That was some ass whooping.  And I don’t remember what happened after that.
