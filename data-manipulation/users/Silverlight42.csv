It was the first knife I bought so it holds a special significance for me.

In the knife collecting world once you pass a certain price point/quality wise, it's going to come down to preference more than 'actually a better knife'.  If you prefer a certain blade steel, a certain grind, the shape or material of the handle, etc.  Some perform better than others depending on the specific cutting task.

Look at the Kershaw's Leek or Skyline.  Look at Benchmade's mini griptilian.  They're all solid edc choices and get recommended a lot.
oh and look at some of Spyderco's knives, many prefer those, but I never got into them so I can't recommend something specifically."
