I disagree. At many schools they teach electrical and mechanical engineering. What's happening is that consumer electronics are becoming so small that they start using integrated electronics that aren't easily accessed or repaired without specialized equipment. Those electronics are becoming more complex to facilitate greater interoperability and connectedness, which has its own virtues and faults. So it's no longer as simple as swapping around wires, but that's not because people today don't know how to swap around wires."

I've heard from several people in grad school that TA jobs are nice because they are considerate of your other student obligations, e.g. your class schedule, so whereas summer jobs might pay a lot, TA jobs are still worth it. Is that your experience as well?

I am definitely interested in undergraduate research (I have some experience in bioinformatics research through UT Southwestern), so that's great news that the professors are open to it!

Do you feel like the classes move at a quick enough pace? Were there times you had a problem and needed the help of a TA/professor to move forward, or were you generally able to figure things out with your peers?

Also, does Turing limit your ability to take classes outside of CS (like maybe one more history class or a creative writing class)? I've heard that honors programs at other schools can be limiting so I'm curious what your take is.

Last question--you mentioned petitioning to take an honors class. What are the criteria for eligibility/who decides the petition?"

ProgrammerHumor,fcv9uz7,t1_fcv7o6l,1577997659.0,"What makes Java bad for games (as best I can recall, it's been a while since I've worked in Java) was the interpreted bytecode and stop-the-world garbage collection.

Games do a LOT of low-level math and basic operations many, many times per second. If Java is .001% slower at integer addition because of auto-boxing, that adds up. Granted, you can usually work around that, but now you're fighting the language instead of using it to it's fullest potential.

OOP isn't really that useful for game development. Granted, some OOP is helpful for the engine, but larger games use more compute-focused models like entity-conponent-systems, where it's extremely beneficial to have a lower-level control over memory allocation so you reduce cache misses and therefore latency.

But there are many stories of companies realizing that they could save money on servers and whatnot by switching languages, so it's not unheard of.
