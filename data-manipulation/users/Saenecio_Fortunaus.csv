Seriously, I’m aware that the nutritional value has been cooked off, I’m aware that there is no juice is left in my steak, I prefer my meat to be tough, and I like the flavor of a little char. If you don’t like it that way, don’t eat it - leave me to eat my meat the way I like it in peace and opinion free."

MurderedByWords,ff9gpr4,t3_esa4sn,1579712647.0,"Or just go back to calling it fat. The woman in that picture is fat. I am fat right now. I really don’t want to be fat, so I making positive changes in my life to help control that. When you start making controllable conditions like being fat or obese watered down with nicer words like “plus sized”, you start to normalize them, or start movements to get people to accept them. Being unhealthily overweight shouldn’t be normalized. People should call being unhealthy and fat what it is. I have no problem with people calling me fat, it is what I am, and I no longer wish to be this way because I alone can change it."

I mean it is totally my opinion that the writing has been sub par since season 9/10 (we get our first real foreshadowing of what the Simpsons are to become here), but my opinion is also shared with a vast number of Simpsons fans as well. At this point, they could do whatever they want to any of the characters, none of them are the characters that I knew growing up. I have absolutely no connection with any of them anymore."

todayilearned,felj5o9,t1_felhpou,1579223436.0,"Was anyone saying that the Nazis were good guys? I literally never once tried to justify their actions or beliefs. The only thing I said was that the Soviets and Stalin were worse, and that they murdered almost double the number of people Hitler did only under a different banner. And actually, I don’t know what country you come from, but everyone in the west learns about the holocaust. What we don’t hear about is Stalin and how he forcibly starved 10 million people in the Ukraine and Belarus. We don’t hear about the gulags, all the innocent political prisoners who were worked, beaten, and/or starved to death in soviet captivity.

Communists are just as bad as the Nazis, all of you should be banished from society, deprived of an opportunity to work, and otherwise ostracized from civilization. The far left and far right can both get fucked, our world would be so much better without any of you larpy douchebags. Anyone who supports either ideology is an absolute hindrance to our progression as a civilization."
todayilearned,felhvl3,t1_felhtct,1579222549.0,Fuck off commie. Find me literally one article. One article of American officers in World War II shooting their own retreating soldiers.
todayilearned,fel7ejz,t1_fekysqk,1579215663.0,"I didn’t say Russians - I’m 21% Russian/Ukrainian, my family would always attest to me that they suffered just as much as anybody under the Soviet regime. Even Russians in the Red Army, most were conscripted and had no choice. The Soviet leadership and commissars had no problem with the raping, looting, and killing, in fact they encouraged it. The same men who would’ve shot a soldier for retreating from a tactically hopeless battle. Soviets are the assholes, not the Russian soldier caught up in their shit system of government."
todayilearned,fektu9m,t1_fekriuz,1579207476.0,"Right, whatever their reasoning was, my qualm is that history books tend to choose not to discuss the gravity of Soviet war crimes or omit them entirely, as if all the Soviet atrocities committed were done to destroy a greater evil/the Nazis. If you take note of the numbers, the Soviet atrocities far outnumber the ones perpetrated by the Nazis. Both sides were evil, but the Soviets shouldn’t get carte Blanche for their atrocities for being on the “same side” we were on."
todayilearned,fekp9t1,t1_fekmnmi,1579204778.0,"And I guess the Soviets raping, murdering, pillaging, and assassinating their way through Eastern Europe on the way in was all in good faith.

People like to give the Chinese a bad rap for Tiananmen, Hong Kong protests, the Uighurs, but nobody really likes to talk about the Holodomor, The Hungarian revolution in ‘56, or Katyn. The Soviet army is responsible for some of the most horrific crimes against humanity within the last century. Literally starving around 12 million people to death just to make some sort of political point. Assassinating tens of thousands of Polish officers as a false flag to drum up support for the Red Army. And the same could be said about just about any other communist government that has existed as well. Just about every communist revolution that has occurred was carried out by a cadre of murderers and thieves."
todayilearned,feknri1,t1_fek2dgi,1579203884.0,The Soviets locked up certain people for years for existing. It could be that the Soviets were always generally kind of bad people to begin with and this guy was just a mechanic who stayed behind to help ensure the survival of innocent people.
