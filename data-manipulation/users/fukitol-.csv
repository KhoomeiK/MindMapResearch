holdmycosmo,fgf6l3a,t1_fgeujwn,1580727233.0,"Tl;Dr: it's because there's no competition in this market due to ridiculous patent laws and the FDA. Basically allow actual competition in the market, and prices will drop and quality will increase.

Honestly, it's because the market hasn't been allowed to be competitive, in my opinion. Imagine if people weren't allowed to patent drugs. The process to manufacture them? Sure. But the actual drug itself, an arrangement of atoms an molecules, shouldn't be able to be patented. 

Or procedures that happen to actual people, those are able to be patented. Why is fucking around inside someone, or a drug schedule, able to be patented? It's fucked, but that's where allowing the government to interfere, and thus enforce those patents, has gotten us.

 Sure, I mean you can blame the companies for patenting them to begin with, and I'd agree that yes, it's fucking evil. But it's also just companies doing what companies do, and I'd argue have a fiduciary responsibility to do: make as much money as they can while not breaking the letter of the law. The problem isn't the companies, it's the laws. They're using the law to their advantage, and I'd expect them to. They have no morality, by definition, that part needs to be legislated. The government exists to protect people from other people, and companies, and nothing more. By changing the laws and preventing the patent system from being abused by things that aren't inventions to be patented, we can fix it. Sure, it'll result in a few fewer dollars for the companies, but I give just as much of a shit about them as they do me. And they'll still make drugs because they can still make money off the process of making a given drug. 

That last part is significant, because someone has to fund the testing of all this shit, and that's on the companies. Right now it costs roughly $19 million to approve a new drug. That, to me, seems ridiculous. I'd argue we allow the Underwriters Labs company to certify everything in our houses, from our phone chargers to our ovens. Things that, without that certification, can easily kill your entire family overnight. Why not allow them, or any of thousands of other companies, to start certifying these drugs? I'd argue that them certifying the drugs would be better than the FDA because they have a reason to do so effectively: they can be put out of business if they fuck up. The FDA cannot, we just let them keep going because they're the government.

Not to mention the fact that we've, for some reason, tied insurance to employment. But that's another issue, I suppose.

In order to build a functional system without letting the government fuck it up worse than they have (honestly, they fuck up everything they do), we need to encourage and allow true competition in every part of this industry. Once that happens prices will plummet, like they do in every other industry where competition is encouraged, and quality will increase. Companies will necessarily perform better at these tasks than Government either does, or currently allows, because they have a reason to. Because they will be sued into oblivion otherwise.

If you want another industry to look at, look at the cable companies. The rights of ways they employ, which were originally created for simple phone calls, are insanely expensive to rent from them and impossible to acquire otherwise, because they bought them in the late 19th century from the government or a few private people. However, one company has really started to fix things: Google. They have the capital to buy or rent rights of ways, and everywhere they've went prices for internet have fallen drastically. Get rid of those rights of ways laws. Require  companies to work with private landowners, or the government if they want to run it around a rail track or something, and allow competition to flourish as more and more cable is laid down, and routers configured, and etc. Bandwidth (your service quality) will necessarily go up, too."

technology,ffz70zp,t1_ffyu99k,1580365968.0,"""free with X"" is functionally appropriate. Sure one could better say ""included with"", but if you're paying for X and you're getting Y as a bonus, Y is free with X. You're not paying anything for Y, you're getting it for no extra cost as a bonus to X.

I don't pay for Prime for the streaming, I pay for the shipping. The streaming service is a bonus I could take or leave. If it weren't included, I'd still have Prime. For me, it's free Streaming service. Something included at no charge to me as a part of something I'd be paying for anyway.

Dental work is expensive, and a $1500/year limit is fine if you're just having cleanings done. The first time you need anything more advanced, you're paying $1000 out of pocket on top of your insurance. Then your insurance is maxed, so forget any other visits to the dentist that year. The sad excuse for dental insurance we have is the reason so few people even bother. They just know the moment a dentist gets them in the chair they've gone into debt, and the longer they wait the higher that debt gets. We need dental insurance that covers more.
