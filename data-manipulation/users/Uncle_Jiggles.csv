depression,fdcscw0,t1_fdcozww,1578282933.0,"No I don't take meds, my therapist when I used to see her recommended  I take medication  but i personally  never liked the idea of relying on a drug to make me happy. 

I respect people who take it but for now I don't feel like I need them. I've got nihilistic depression, anxiety, sexual and physical abuse, I'm also a little sociopathic and bipolar. I get heavy mood swings of manic highs and depressive lows. I'd like to stress that I'm never violent, im a pacifist and I am overall in good health but I'm not the same as I used to be. 

I am cursed with something that will be with me for the rest of my life. I live on mountain tops one week where I can do anything and the next I lay in bed for a week and I sleep, I don't eat (longest recently was 2 days). I don't feel like I deserve to eat, I feel the need to be hurt physically because it feels good idk. 

Things are okay, I guess. You just play the hand that you're dealt with in life. I'm in a bad low right now but am currently trying to better myself. I'm not asking for sympathy or even wise words because ultimately only I can fix my own problems. This post reminds me of a pattern with my dreams, my manic high dreams are usually involve me with women whom I know and living happy lives with them. The idea that I'll never be alone or hurt is soothed. 

My dreams during my lows, well it usually involves my exs sleeping with men, me being violent and hurting people that I percieved a threat to me. I wake up from these dreams either starting my day in blissful joy or sheer hollowness and all I can do is keep going."

In my state getting caught with weed is not necessarily a huge deal but as soon as a cop finds wax on you they think you're doing heroine. It Automatically makes your sentence 10x worse because it's considered a ""potent and concentrated form of a schedule 1 drug"".

It's all bullshit."
AskReddit,fcigxx0,t1_fci0ywj,1577662370.0,"Couple things I don't like about weed despite being a daily smoker.

1. I dont dream when I smoke and when I take tolerance breaks my dreams come back crazy, and just weirdly absurd. Usually involves women whom I've loved and makes me wake up severly depressed. 

2. I can get paranoid really really easily when I smoke because it's still illegal in my state which is a felony and mandatory 7 years in prison for anything over 7gs. More jail time if you get caught with edibles or God forbid you get caught with a dab. 

3. When I don't have weed or if I choose to stop smoking for long period of time I get super fucking irritated and just on edge and I get super depressed. 

Weed is just like any other thing on this planet. You can overdose on cheeseburgers, you can overdose on coffee, it's all about balance and finding a perfect harmony."
depression,fc7f8f3,t1_fc6m700,1577505644.0,"I've emptied myself of all emotions and I live in a constant state of quite desperation. I don't feel emotions anymore and infact it just feels like a fake mask I put on. When I'm alone my mask comes off and I'm stuck in this nihilistic exsistential depression.  I've lost all faith in humanity. I feel as if I've lived a thousand years and I've seen so many horrible things yet I'm only 24.... I have no interests in living but I could never kill myself. I force myself to live in this literal hell because I feel it's a fitting albatross I will wear around my neck. 

I have everything I could ever want and yet it's never going to fill this emptiness I feel inside of me. Your therapists only care because *you pay them to care*, nobody but you can fix your problems and even if you did ask for help people don't want to hear your problems let alone help you. I've been abandoned abused and chewed up and spit out by every single person I've known in my life and yet still I convince myself that they actually care about my problems or that they won't leave you despite them saying they never would (yet they do).

My mind is an animal in the sense that im aware that I'm depressed, sexually and physically abused, anxiety, etc. And I can't get it out. No matter what I do I will always have this emptiness this anger, this albatross. And the only thing I can do is hope that it gets tighter around my neck as I sit here and build metaphorical walls to isolate myself from the world to protect myself.  

In the end nothing matters and out of spite for myself I will keep going until the day my heart stops. My Outlook on humanity i hope one day will change but I find that idea fleeting. my body is alive but my mind is gone and I'm honestly okay with it...."

mildlyinteresting,fc71zw7,t1_fc70p7n,1577495414.0,"Because I watched as 30 yards away this new lifeguard rushed to the unconscious baby that was on the ground and I watched as he blew full breaths into the baby's airway. (Keep in mind the lifeguard was only 18 years old with maybe two weeks of training) When first responders arrived they also tried to perform CPR and they pronounced the child dead by the time they left.  later my manager who was the head lifeguard informed me and every other lifeguard that thanks to his lack of training that yes he did indeed pop a baby's lungs. They fired the lifeguard and is no longer allowed to work as one in the state of Indiana. This was after he had to go through the court system to prove his innocence. 

We had to go back and recertify on all of our training including the one important part and for two years afterwards I and my fellow co-workers was/were terrified that another baby was gonna drown and we'd have another incident. 

Did I specifically see it first hand right in front of me? No, I saw it all unfold within 30 yards as I was busy watching my section of the pool. I only found out the details after the fact."

You're gonna tell me that my own first hand life experience is wrong?

I'm just sharing a story of what happened and why you should always be knowledgeable on what life saving procedures you're doing. But if you guys just wanna pop babies lungs all day then go ahead and don't believe my story. 

It's a legitimate thing that can and will happen if you're not aware of it."
mildlyinteresting,fc6ljms,t1_fc6le1s,1577483424.0,"I agree with you but not all states have good Samaritan laws. It really depends on where you live which is why I can't stress enough that if youre gonna do life saving procedures you should always A. Know what you are doing. And B. Be familiar with what laws protect you in what states.

My state was fortunate enough to have Samaritan laws so it was never worried about it but for example if you receive somebody who didn't want to be revived they could sue the shit out of you if those laws are not covered in your state."
mildlyinteresting,fc6j7ua,t1_fc6j2wi,1577481869.0,"Yes, after paramedics came and took the child away sheriff's came up and he was placed in cuffs.  he got essentially pardoned because of a clause that protects lifeguards from shit like this but if a normal everyday person does CPR and doesn't know how to do it properly they can face murder charges."
mildlyinteresting,fc6ijjr,t1_fc5tot1,1577481406.0,"Please tell me it showed the proper way to do cpr on a baby.....

 Because I was once a lifeguard at a pool where a baby had drowned. The new lifeguard instead of using half breaths used a full breath and literally exploded the babies lungs. 

If you're ever doing CPR on anything younger than a 12 year old for the love of God use a half breath or you will be in jail for manslaughter. 

Not alot of people.realoze that you have the power to pop a newborns lungs and I can't comprehend why it isn't stressed during training."

AskReddit,fb04vln,t3_eauhhu,1576422607.0,"I suffer from nihilistic depression, exsistential depression, anxiety, sexual and physical abuse..... I find no inherit joy in life, I have little to no purpose, I don't feel emotions at all I wear them like a mask. I smile but my eyes are dead. I'm more of a hollow shell and have been diagnosed with sociopathic tendencies. I don't feel emotions I wear them like masks and underneath is a constant state of fear, stress, and indifference. I find it easy to manipulate people into doing whatever I want and I can take advantage of them for personal gain but I don't act on them. 

I don't want to live but I could never kill myself, I've tried and failed on two occasions and my therapists don't give a shit as long as I don't kill myself because that's all they're paid to do they only care because I paid them to care. I don't know how to live alone because being alone with my thoughts drives me insane so I date women in order to fill a hole that will never be filled. The only way to end it all is to kill myself but I can't do it. I just can't......

Nobody gives a shit about you or your mental health because at the end of the day only you can fix your life and everybody else worries about their own. I don't want to be medicated, because I don't want to rely on an artificial drug to make me seem happy. You can take all the pills in the world but it will never solve your problems or fix your broken soul. Your life doesn't matter, nobody is born for a purpose, and everything will be destroyed when the universe collapses in on itself destroying everything you and whatever else humanity has achieved or ever built. You're life and the entirely of the human races is nothing but a blink in time compared to the endless universe. 


I just take it one day at a time as cliche as it sounds but its true. I wake up everyday wanting to die in the hopes I'll get killed by an accident or whatever but I still keep going. And it's truly a living hell I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.....  I have more money than I could ever want and yet I'm still never happy. 

Idk man, I knew life was never easy but I'm only 24 and if this is how my life is gonna be like then idk how long things will go. I'm terrified that when I get older I'll lose my mental state on the idea of suicide and do it and that idea alone will terrify me and haunts me. 

I don't need people to fix my problems because there isn't anything they can do. My mind is a rabid animal and the only thing that keeps me afloat is a sliver of hope but even that fades from time to time and I truly am not happy nor do I ever feel happy. Even on good days my happiness I know is a mask that I can easily switch off......

*Sigh* so yeah, that's my problems and forever will be them."
