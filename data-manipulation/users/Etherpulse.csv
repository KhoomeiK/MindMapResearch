> In this context, the reward that we're looking for is a fulfillment. It's the happily ever after moment in the storybook, after which there will be no more striving and no more suffering. 

Being satisfied is possible unless one is permanently limited physically, mentally or financially. I have never seen anyone equating life satisfaction with being immune to pain, it might be just your point of view.

> The individual would likely prefer not to feel the obligation to other people.

That's still choosing to live for other people for as long as they are not being forced to do so. It's insignificant what the individual prefers in their thoughts, a criminal might prefer obeying the law, but it doesn't change the fact they chose to break it multiple times.

Forfeiting the game goes against all of our instincts, 

You said two contradicting things. To cut one's losses means to stop doing something disadvantageous, which is perfectly harmonious with the self-preservation instinct.

> It doesn't really make sense to say ""I prefer life"", given that the alternative to life is a state that one will never experience. You can only really have a preference between different states that you have experienced or at least are capable of experiencing.

You can expect the unpleasant process of dying (pain, fear, awareness of abandoning people you care about) and thus, prefer the opposite (conserving yourself). 

> A lot of suicidal people do take steps to try and prepare themselves for suicide. But never reach the point of actually going through with it. Or some will be suicidal over a period of many years, perhaps decades, and will eventually find the willpower one day to go through with it. 

They were uncertain (not stark on wanting it), something was holding them back.

> Does that mean that the decades they spent being absolutely debilitated by their hatred of life and yearning for death don't count as a legitimate desire for suicide? 

It means they spent years being unsatisfied with life, thinking about ending it, but didn't take action to solve it, there were clearly stronger factors at play. They might as well spent decades fantasising about being a teacher. Their ability to live with themselves for that long ignoring that wish indicates it wasn't that genuine and firm.

Because gambling (or any other addiction) eases their pain, it's a habit or they don't know anything better to do. They are not ""unable to stop"", their willpower is just too weak, they don't have a healthy substitute. 

It seems you are trying to say that someone playing video games all day wants to go to work just as much as someone disciplined who goes to work despite their initial reluctance. That wanting is not shown by actions, but by merely wishing. That people can be possessed and deprived of their ability to control themselves.

So, in other words, the reward is more appealing than suicide and leads to choosing life.

You want to stay alive for other people.

> suicide is extremely dangerous and painful

Fear of destruction (attraction to life) is stronger than the attraction to death.

It's sensible and honest to say "" I don't like life, but I still prefer it because of a few reasons."" It avoids stating humans are robots incapable of restraining themselves to their benefit (which is widely untrue).
