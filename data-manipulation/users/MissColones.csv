stepparents,ffxf0y6,t3_evmlru,1580323821.0,"I met my SD4 when she was 2. She was combative from the start, super jealous. She still is, but it's not as bad as it used to be.

HOWEVER, she started to like me once I started doing my own things with her, separate from her dad. I played soccer with her and we'd pass a balloon around. We started doing makeup together and playing our own games. 

All of a sudden she's hugging me nonstop and saying how much she loves me. We basically formed our own relationship, and she no longer saw me as this entity attached to her dad. I was her own separate adult. At one point, it got out of hand and she was suffocating me. Not a bad problem, considering that she used to assault me, but I had to disengage because she wanted me to EVERYTHING for her after that. 

We still have issues, but it's mostly my own shit, lol."

stepparents,ffsiys2,t3_euxxh0,1580182843.0,"I wish I'd have known that I'd often feel frustrated and stifled and stressed out and annoyed. 

I honestly thought being a step would be great. I thought my SD, DH, and I would be a loving happy family. And we are. Ish.

If I could do it all over again I wouldn't choose to be with someone with kids. I hate that I think that because I love my hubby so much, but my first year with my SD was an absolute nightmare. It's gotten so much better, but I can't bring myself to loving my SD like I feel like I should. And I kind of don't care to most of the time. The kid stresses me out.

I learned about a side of myself that I'm not proud of. And it only comes out when she's around. 

Having said that, I'm a good stepmom in that I take care of my SD and help provide for her and I take the time to teach her things. She follows me everywhere and we're very affectionate with one another. I try to keep my struggles internal and this sub has allowed me to express myself  to other steps. It's kept me sane."

stepparents,ffrujui,t3_euu4pk,1580166146.0,"I went through the same thing of not being told when SD came over. I felt like a second class household member. DH couldn't see it from my perspective. He resorted to cheap shots and said it's his house and it was hers before I ever moved in. He said I was only making a fuss because i hated his daughter. 

She was a toddler! It's all hands on deck when she's over. A little fair warning was all I wanted. I felt like like his conversations and decisions with BM were more important than my feelings or efforts.

We argued and talked a lot about this very thing regarding advance notice, among other SD issues.

It got to the point where my only recourse was disengagement. I finally told DH he can bring his kid over without telling me at all. I didn't want to argue about it anymore. I didn't want any problems associated with her. He can do whatever he wants with her. She's his kid, it's his house, it's her house, I get it. 

After that, he had to do EVERYTHING for her and with her. She was so demanding and misbehaved and he had to deal with all of it himself. Hahahaha. And I was 100% hands off. I didn't even say much to his kid. The divide in his own family life was hurting him more than it was me, that's for sure. 

Then, he started telling me he was bringing her over. Then I'd help him out and be more engaged with his kid. If he didn't tell me ahead of time, I was hands off. He learned the value of such a small, but very considerate gesture.

Now, if he doesn't tell me, it's only cuz he thought he did or he forgot - and he apologises for it.

If you don't like kids and your partner's kids annoy you, I strongly suggest disengagement and even going out whenever the kids are over. Go to the gym or library. Maybe he'll realise he wants you to have a greater role in his kids' lives and all he has to do is suck it up and be considerate, not some obstinate prick who feels entitled because he's a dad."
stepparents,ffr0e3s,t3_euoet2,1580147695.0,"You're not a failure at all. Your wife just wants to do things her way with her son, and it's great she's not asking you to take that on anymore. She knows it's stressing you out and she's doing the right thing by not asking you to change.

I'm more consistently strict with my SD than DH (grew up with a dad who had a military dad). For that, he's also limits the amount of time I need to look after her when he needs to step away to do something. And I am totally cool with it. It's exhausting and stressful for me and he knows it."
stepparents,ffqjmuh,t3_euon54,1580136416.0,"That must be so frustrating to witness and live with! Your wife is the one fostering it, she's the source of the problem, not your SS. He's just an extension possibly of her own vanity and need to feel needed by her precious baby."
stepparents,ffo09rz,t3_eu8y96,1580072882.0,"I've gone through it with my SD4. I came into her life when she was 2. She was jealous from the start and then it got worse before it got better. 

She made every effort to separate us, even if he was just talking to me. She hit me, punched me, kicked me, fell on me, and tried to stab me with whatever was in her hand. 

The violence stopped because 1) my husband and I have been teaching her that any sort of hitting is unacceptable; and 2) I just disengaged to give DH and SD private time together - and give me the space needed to keep my sanity. 

Now that she's not physically acting out her jealousy, it manifests in other ways, like lots of interrupting or ridiculous antics to get her dad's attention. So now we're trying to teach her not to be rude because she's become exceptionally annoying, especially to DH, lol.

I do think my SD thinks of me as less of a threat now, and she's mellowed out considerably. Especially since I've formed a more solid relationship with her. She interacts with me differently than with her own parents and we have our own games and inside jokes. Now, if other kids are around and I engage with them, she gets super jealous and possessive of me. And sometimes, if my husband tries to hold my hand, she'll push him away and cling to me and say that I'm hers. Go figure.

I've seen jeolousy with daughters towards their own BMs and vice-versa with sons and their BDs, so I think it's more of a natural Oedipal thing that happens sometimes, which I'm sure excites Freud scholars."

She really listens if I sing songs in English and teach her fun phrases, the alphabet, and numbers. It's amazing what they can pick up. At one point my SD was saying, ""Omigosh!"" all the time, lol. When we go grocery shopping, she points ar things and asks what they are and I teach them to her in English.

stepparents,ffjrncr,t3_etvkvx,1580005116.0,"It's super important that you're being honest with yourself and your GF. I think a lot of us steps go into our relationships thinking it'll all be fine and work out. Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. When it comes to family, members have to make sacrifices to make the unit work. And with kids, anything can happen. 

I think you should give it more time to see if it's right for you. Kids are needy and need a ton of care and attention. Your GF is chiefly responsible for that, but a lot will fall on you, especially if you live with your SD fulltime."

All you can do is say it can be challenging, talk about your challenges, and let your sister know you'll always be there for her. It's her own journey after all."

Then would him have a sneaky friendship with someone of the opposite sex been okay? Married people should act married. Your husband needs to acknowledge his part in the misunderstanding. We have a responsibility to make our spouse feel secure and that's through openness and not doing shit that would make them feel jealous or threatened.

I know my husband wouldn't want me hanging out with a young intriguing guy who lives next door, not without him present. I've been in so many situations which I thought were platonic and the guy got the wrong idea. The same is possible for men hanging out with other women. I can understand how you'd be jealous, OP.

stepparents,ff6tlrb,t3_ervqjy,1579634618.0,"The reason why DH doesn't have his daughter more than on weekends is because before I came into his life, he couldn't look after his daughter with the kind of long hours he works. 

Now I live with him and I work from home, and EVERYONE from the BM to both grandparents, to his family said, why doesn't she live with us full-time - I'm at home doing ""nothing"" anyway. 

Bless my husband. His attitude has always been, she's his daughter, she's his responsibility and the BM's, not mine. If his daughter ever had to live with us fulltime, he said he'd hire a nanny. He would never expect me to shoulder the burden.

I feel like you've been done a huge injustice by both BPs who are helpless, sad people. Their son is destined to be the same and they are doing him a huge injustice by raising a dislikable kid. 

Your husband's default strategy is based on what he's known. No surprise there. He lacks the tools and doesn't know what discipline looks like. Seeing it first hand through his wife must come as a shock for him. And it probably hurts and bothers him.

I grew up in a strict household and I'm strict and consistent with my SD. She messes with me less than she does around DH. He's pretty strict too but he's not consistent always, and sometimes he softens up right after he scolds his daughter. She immediately forgets what she did and does it all over again. This makes me mad and I end up begrudging SD and DH. I know how you feel. I pick my battles and sometimes I will give DH feedback on how I think he could've handled something better. Then we talk about it and try to keep it peaceful.

Last week, she just flat out said, ""Daddy, I don't eat this,"" and tried to throw the food over her chair. DH made her eat it!

So the only way to get her to eat is always to say she can't have ice cream or popcorn unless she eats all her meal. It's not sustainable to do this every time. And it makes every fucking meal a battle of the wills."

If you still want to celebrate your birthday, you can always let him know that you'd like to do something special with just the two of you the day before or after or another day. Just like having a birthday party on the weekend when your real birthday is during the week."

I was once in a relationship that started out with a lot of reservation from me and my then-boyfriend. We were trying to respect each other's priorities, give each other enough space to make a concrete decision in becoming officially a couple. There were a lot of unreturned emails, calls, and texts, lots of waiting time in-between responses. This went on for almost a year. 

Before our one-year non-anniversary, I said I was tired of not having met his family or friends and being this secret. I felt I was too important to tuck away like that and I wanted to be with someone who wanted to share me with the people in his life. He decided to step up and bring me into his life.

We were together for almost 11 years. And they were, for the most part, happy years. But we never had a strong foundation that we should have started building from the beginning or near it. I thought we were growing together, but my BF was NEVER all in. I told myself what I wanted to hear and I rationalized all of our shortcomings as a couple, but the reality was when we talked about marriage and having kids, that's all it was to him. Talk. While I was planning. After 5 years of TALKING, he concluded he just didn't know whether he wanted kids at all. We broke up because I couldn't wait around for Mr. Half-Ass anymore.

I bring this up because your man sounds like my ex. He's petty and critical of very small things about you. You'll never feel perfect or enough to him. And my ex was rich too, lol. Also, the fact that your man has kids will always be his reason as to why you'll never feel like a priority or as important to him. 

The reality is, when men really want something, they tend to be fearless about it. They don't make silly excuses for not texting or for not telling the people in their life about you. Clearly your man is not in a place in his life where he's ready for a serious relationship. He's still letting his fears guide him, and that, in my opinion, is a tedious man to try to love and navigate. Taking a ""break"" to test the strength of your bond is a bullshit solution. It's a way of creating space between you two so that you can transition more easily into a breakup.

If I could talk to my younger self back then, I'd tell her what I'm about to tell you. You deserve someone who's crazy about you; someone who's excited to talk to you and text you and hates being away from you; someone who talks passionately about a great future with you; someone who really wants you in his life as of NOW. That's who you want to build a strong relationship with because life ain't easy. You need a strong bond with your SO to get through everything life is going to throw at you.

I'm happy I made the move to end the relationship. I met someone who was ALL IN from the start. He's all those things I mentioned AND he's smoking hot. He's a great husband who knows how to make both me and his daughter feel like priorities in his life. I've never been this happy with anyone else.

You know what? After we broke up, my ex got a new girlfriend WITH A KID. And he's miserable. They break up practically every month and he can't seem to break the cycle. We still talk and he always brings up how great he had it with me. Well, boo fucking hoo. 

You seem like a thoughtful, intelligent woman with a bright future ahead of you in law. Know your worth and tackle your life with a man who's excited to be a part of your journey."
