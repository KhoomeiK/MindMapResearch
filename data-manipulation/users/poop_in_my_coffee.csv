Family physicians don't care about complex things like data - all they want to know is whether the product can help their patients or not; does it have acceptable side effects?; is the mode of administration acceptable for patients?, etc. An MD or PharmD is perfect for this.

Specialists on the other hand care about the data. PhD maybe preferred for this."
AskReddit,ffgpjm7,t3_etcyd6,1579911802.0,"The real reason men are depressed is because all men want is a good woman. Everything a man does in life is geared towards that goal. Traditionally, men had something of great value to offer - they were breadwinners. Nowadays men don't have that value. Most men can't even ask out a woman anymore because they think they're not good enough. What value does a man have in society anymore? Men simply have not changed psychologically as fast as society has changed."
Advice,ffektxm,t3_et01eb,1579852260.0,"Don't. Your lifestyle is not suited for having a dog. You move around way too much. I have a dog and in the last few years, I had to move around a few times. Every single time it was an awful experience for my dog. Dogs don't like change at all. They get used to one environment and want it to stay that way. If you do it, your dog will grow up to have lot of issues. Also think about the fact that lots of apartments and rental properties will NOT allow you to rent if you have a pet. It's a huge issue to rent when you have a pet - especially a dog.

And of course, I don't need to tell you that a dog is like having a permanent 2 year old child. The novelty and excitement of having a puppy will wear off quick. It's a shit ton of work and a commitment of 10 - 15 years. You can also expect to spend $2000 - $5000 per year on them, which includes food, treats, toys, clothes, and vet visits. 

No matter how healthy your dog is, they always seem to get things like eye/ear infections, broken nails, an unexpected injury, etc. Vet visits and vet bills will be part of your life. You want to have one vet that you go to on a regular basis so they know your dog and your dog knows them.

Why not get a cat? Much easier and cheaper to take care of, are also very affectionate, and they don't care about changes to their environment."

Ultimately I think ebooks are for when you already have tons of followers. Like what Oberlo is doing right now - they just launched a free ebook - I saw the ad for it just yday.

And in his mind he came to believe that a man should make money and everything else doesn't matter. So, when he became a father, that's what he focused on.

* Some of your product description font colours are gray and some are black - just keep them black since the gray is hard to read.

* You can just put a ""Free shipping on all orders"" banner somewhere on your site instead of putting it in some product descriptions

* You should have an ""About us"" section

* Check out and try to mimic some of Home Depot's plants and pots website: https://www.homedepot.com/b/Outdoors-Garden-Center-Planters/N-5yc1vZbx81

dropship,fclnwl8,t3_ehsbh2,1577752226.0,"Hey man, overall the website itself looks clean but there are a lot of issues that prevent you from doing well. Also, $35 is nothing - most ppl don't make sales with only spending that little of an amount when they first start out. 

Here's a critique for your store (sorry if it's a bit harsh):

* You say you have a niche, but can you put into words what the niche is? Is it men's watches? men's t-shirts? men's jewellery? ... you're selling a little bit of everything for men and even stuff for women, which makes it pretty general.

* Your website copy is not appealing at all - like there's no headline or tagline on your landing page; your brand story is bland and boring. Make your tagline something like ""Upgrade your style in 2020."" or something like that - something that tells a person what your site is all about and how it'll help them (i.e., it will help them look more cool/stylish)

* Your refund policy is ridiculous - you really want ppl to apply for a refund simply because they didn't like the product? 

* Your product pictures are not that great

* Your product descriptions are not that great - some still say what the aliexpress description said

* Little issues like typos in some places (like your footer, under ""who we are"")

***

Overall, you have too many products - pick a few and just do those really well. Over time, you can add more, but for now just focus on a few so you can really create amazing descriptions and things. And you have to create very professional and compelling copy throughout your website, including your landing page.

I always remember the idiots who would buy things on ""sale"". For example, normally, hotdogs were priced at $1 a pack and wouldn't sell too well. But then we'd put a huge ""SALE"" sign and drop the price a whopping 1 cent to 99c. We would sell out of all the hotdogs on those days. Poor ppl have a mentality where they think that saving even a penny is a big deal. Like if they save a penny on every transaction in life, it'll amount to something big."

* You can just put a ""Free shipping on all orders"" banner somewhere on your site instead of putting it in some product descriptions

* You should have an ""About us"" section

* Check out and try to mimic some of Home Depot's plants and pots website: https://www.homedepot.com/b/Outdoors-Garden-Center-Planters/N-5yc1vZbx81

dropship,fclnwl8,t3_ehsbh2,1577752226.0,"Hey man, overall the website itself looks clean but there are a lot of issues that prevent you from doing well. Also, $35 is nothing - most ppl don't make sales with only spending that little of an amount when they first start out. 

Here's a critique for your store (sorry if it's a bit harsh):

* You say you have a niche, but can you put into words what the niche is? Is it men's watches? men's t-shirts? men's jewellery? ... you're selling a little bit of everything for men and even stuff for women, which makes it pretty general.

* Your website copy is not appealing at all - like there's no headline or tagline on your landing page; your brand story is bland and boring. Make your tagline something like ""Upgrade your style in 2020."" or something like that - something that tells a person what your site is all about and how it'll help them (i.e., it will help them look more cool/stylish)

* Your refund policy is ridiculous - you really want ppl to apply for a refund simply because they didn't like the product? 

* Your product pictures are not that great

* Your product descriptions are not that great - some still say what the aliexpress description said

* Little issues like typos in some places (like your footer, under ""who we are"")

***

Overall, you have too many products - pick a few and just do those really well. Over time, you can add more, but for now just focus on a few so you can really create amazing descriptions and things. And you have to create very professional and compelling copy throughout your website, including your landing page.

* Shopify payments don't work for stores selling CBD or hemp products. You'd have to find a 3rd party payment gateway.

* Facebook Ads do not allow any promotion of CBD or hemp products. So, it would be very difficult to get traffic to your store once you create it. You'd have to go the long-term SEO/Blogging/Guest posting/Social Media route. Even with some sales from that, you would not be able to scale.
