tumblr,fdmk5cw,t3_em08kf,1578552901.0,"Around 2006ish my close friend got pulled out of class by the school officer for this powerpoint project in his high school freshman year where you were given a pet rock and had to give it a name and story. My friend, being full of snark and dark humor decided his rock would be named Timmy and was evil. As part of the project, he made charts and graphs showing the progress of the evil things Timmy had done:  running people over; burning/destroying schools;  and quoted from the Grinch ""solve world hunger, tell no one"". A couple class periods later he was pulled out of class and the officer had a printout of the offending PowerPoint project and demanded to know what it was all about and my friend laughed and said ""it was just a joke!"" The officer let him go back to class and his parents weren't called, but he did tell them when he got home later. They laughed and his mom just looked at his dad and said ""YOUR f*ing son"". They laughed more."
