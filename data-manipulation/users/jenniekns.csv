SCBuildIt,ffrdlvq,t3_eumoa3,1580155907.0,"I did the same thing as you - I leveled up fast without focusing on building up my storage. You may want to think about camping out for a while. Don't focus on residential or regional expansion for a bit. Just create and sell product and save up some coins. Don't worry about hanging on to materials - build and sell, and use the existing warehouse space to save up on storage items. Whenever you're in the global market and you see storage items, snap them up quick. It may take a couple of weeks but you should be able to start adding some room to your storage.

I would avoid using simcash for this as much as possible. For the amount of extra space that you get from leveling up your storage (5+ per level) and the cost of the items, you're going to run out of cash fast if you try to do this without gathering the items through the market or through trading, and it's not going to get you very far in the grand scheme of things. I would only touch it when you're close (i.e. you have all of the items that you need for the next level except that one damn lock)."

noraroberts,ffqjqkj,t3_eankil,1580136496.0,"This has always been on my Top 5 of NR books since it was released, but I'll admit that I had a different experience in reading it this time around. I don't know if it was that I had read comments about the book that others had made here in the sub, or if it's that I've gotten older over the years and my expectations/outlook has changed. 

A few people had made comments about the book's pacing, and at first I didn't agree based on my memory of reading it in the past. This time around, though, I definitely noticed what was being said. I don't know if it was that people had made me aware of it so I was looking for it, or if I've lost some of the patience/expectations that I had in the past, but there were points where the plot really seemed to either lag for too long or time moved so quickly that you couldn't tell where the story was in terms of the time of year. I don't know if this makes sense, but it seemed like the story points - the divorce, the murder, the tampering, the corporate espionage, the family drama - was all moving at one speed, while the vineyard and the seasons were moving at a totally different speed, and the two didn't match up the way that I expected them to.

The characters were great, and I think that's what I had originally taken from the book in the past. When NR wants to she can really sink her teeth into character development. Sophia and Tyler could have been stereotypes - the flashy businesswoman with the Italian temper and the anti-social farmer who can't connect to the world - but NR made sure to add facets that made the two more than stereotypes. Sophia was flashy and had a temper, but she was also warm and caring and knew when to be patient. Tyler was a curmudgeon who was happiest when working the land, but he was also able to bond with Maddy and could think on a business level when he needed to. This also wasn't an insta-love type of a story. Sophia and Tyler's relationship grew over time and you could see it happening in different scenes. 

The extended family was also, I think, a big reason why I've enjoyed this book in the past. The MacGregor series was what first brought me into NR's world, and as u/Erbearlee pointed out, there were some MacGregor-esque moments and characters. I love when a book is written in such a way that the main focus is one two people but the supporting cast is there to do more than give the main characters someone to talk to. This could have easily been turned into a series with books about Pilar and David and Tereza and the kids. 

This is still going to be towards the top of the list for me, but I think it may have slipped out of my Top 5. I'd give it 3.5 stars out of 5."

DC_Cinematic,ff8yv2g,t1_ff8fkwa,1579700420.0,"I think Bale was the best Batman for the time period that the Nolan movies were set in. It was the beginning of his journey as the Caped Crusader, he still had this sense of youthful optimism that he could make a difference. 

Affleck's version was meant to be 20 years into that experience - older, wiser, more experienced both in terms of life as Bruce Wayne and life as Batman. You could see the weight of his responsibilities sitting on his shoulders, but he still showed a small bit of that optimism that he was doing something that would help people.

ShitAmericansSay,ff5zmxg,t1_ff5rgk3,1579615276.0,"Well first I think we may need to figure out what you consider the Maritimes to be. When I think of a stereotypical fishermen with an Irish background, I think of what is usually associated with Newfoundland, which is not part of the Maritimes.

The Maritimes are New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. Culturally, the three provinces are mostly Acadian, Scottish, and British, with some Eastern European and Mi'kmaq influences. You'll see some Irish/Celtic influences in the Highlands and a bit in PEI, but the Scots were the bigger settlers here in terms of the Gaelic culture. Economically there is some fishing still happening in pockets throughout the three provinces, but it hasn't been the predominate economic activity in generations. It's mostly agriculture, forestry, tourism, and off-shore oil/natural gas. Halifax is also becoming tech, academia, and research heavy, largely being driven by the ten universities in Nova Scotia.

Is your comment that the Maritimes is all Irish and fishermen completely 100% wrong? No, but that doesn't mean that you were right. There's a lot more to Canada than stereotypes.

Also, you included Maine in that comparison:

>When I think of the Maritimes I think of fisheries and Irish influence, so I suppose Maine is close enough.

Maine was predominately settled by the Acadians before the British moved in. French is the second most common language spoken in Maine and there are more French-speaking people in Maine than there are in Louisiana. No Irish influences at all."

That's one of the things that I think I like about this book, as well. The characters actually grow and develop as people. As Sophia's relationships change, she changes as person. She's not a commitment-phobe who miraculously changes into a different person in time for the happily-ever-after. You can actually see the walls break down within the character's thinking.

I think you're right about that. There's a lot of back-and-forth between the stories and I can see how that would slow down the plot for someone who just wanted to get through from beginning to end.
