textiles,ffby57u,t1_ffbv5pr,1579786498.0," you could definitely throw some stitch witch in-between the two layers to secure before sewing the back portion down, though a fusible adhesive like that will need to be sewn through to prevent seperating after washing (If that garment is washable) so you could also technically quilt the blanket to the jacket (depending on print etc) to keep everything flush"
textiles,ffbumq7,t3_essdjf,1579783318.0,"depending on the weave of the blanket there are several things you can do to make sure the edges don't fray, serging the edges will 100 percent ensure longevity but not everyone has one, if you have an overcast foot for your machine it may do something similar depending on the blanket. Otherwise, just turning the edge under itself and topstitching will keep the parts that are frayable encased between the patch and jacket. Hope this helps!"

TwoXChromosomes,fdqjglo,t1_fdqik6v,1578668163.0,My mom is the only member of her family of 6 to not to struggle with addiction or abuse. For her family that's historically a totally normal and okay situation to be in. Luckily my aunt married someone in her retirement who understands recovery and they are both happily sober and back in Ontario.
TwoXChromosomes,fdqafwy,t1_fdq4ttw,1578661127.0,"I remember when I was a kid my mom flew to the north tip of vancouver island to take care of her sister after a double mastectomy.  My aunt lived in a pretty isolated inlet with her partner who up until that moment was ""fine"" but not necessarily ""great""  so my mom knew she would be needed.  My mom arrived just in time to catch my aunt making her p.o.s husband dinner having just got home from a three day hospital stay where they fully removed her breasts.  He tried to save face and when my mom lost it,  tried to intimidate her into playing housemaid for him too. He was still sleeping outside in the trailer when my mom arrived back home in ontario three weeks later. They separated within the year.

AskWomen,fdc84zc,t3_ekhphw,1578268965.0,"I grew up in a tight-knit community with a 1:4 girl/boy ratio so for a long time i just subjugated my own interests in order to be able to play with the other kids because I was smart and adaptable (My childhood was a happy one, this was just democracy) I've always been a bit scrappy  but longed for some Jane-Austen-Bennet-Sister shit though I struggled to feel secure in my female friendships just because girls are groomed to compete with each other pretty early on.  It wasn't until the end of a toxic relationship  in my early 20s that I realised how naive it was to put my sense of security in the hands of men.  When it ended so many women I thought saw me as a NPC came to my hut and built a village around me. I was able to experience some deep healing and the level of emotional care I received was really inspiring."
