It essentially allowed you to create any character you wanted, and if I remember right you could even create a pure crafter and just level as that..  


It truly was a unique game, at least in my eyes. It also was the first one that I remember having a ""Bubble"" that allowed no loading screens, you could run from one side to the other side with no screens, only time you met them was using portals/entering instances.

I often wonder how the MMO genre would have changed if AC was more popular than EQ"
