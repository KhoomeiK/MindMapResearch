Not at all. I upvoted you when I replied, because you made good points and I thought you were perfectly respectful. I just wanted to make my own position clear, because I felt it was being misinterpreted, not just by you, but by others who replied to me. Which just means I didn't phrase it as well as I could have the first time. I hope I came across equally well in my interaction with you.

>My only comment is that your last comment is true when you frame the situation between two elastic goods / services.

Yes, the inelasticity of demand for insulin does bring in a potential issue. I'm not an economist, but the reason I'm not particularly worried about it (assuming proper enforcement of anti-trust laws, which is not happening right now), is because I see competition as a price limiting factor. Insulin has been around a long time, and is not under a patent, so any pharmaceutical company can choose to produce it. That means if it gets highly profitable because of high margins, others will have an incentive to produce it to get in on those profits. If we have enough people in the game, the price will eventually approach cost of production, even in inelastic demand, because people will buy from the cheapest source.

As I've said, I'm not an economist so I could be wrong and missing something. And although I'm a believer in the power of the free market, I'm not a fanatic. The reason I brought up public roads is because libertarians constantly bring up the point that they prefer private toll roads, missing the point that the power of free market capitalism depends on competition, and unless they expect 20 different parallel roads everywhere so we can pick the best quality road for the best price, the mechanism just isn't suitable! There are many such cases, and if you make a good convincing argument for why the competition won't work here long term, I'm absolutely willing to admit a different approach is needed."
AskReddit,ff4qx52,t1_ff4muiu,1579570294.0,"I don't disagree with your points. As I've answered to someone else, I didn't mean to imply everything is a perfect free market, I meant to say that the person I was replying to had an oversimplification: in a free market, you still won't get boundless increase in wages, because increased prices decrease demand. That's all.

>Also, the wages are not capped by demand... obviously.

As I've explained in my mechanism, they are. Demand isn't a synonym for want. A lot of people want Ferraris, but because most people can't afford them, the demand for Ferraris is low. Demand is a term that describes how much people will buy something at a particular price point, and the reason they choose to buy it or not buy it doesn't matter, including not having the money to buy it.

So, as much as I might want the best of care when I'm old, if I can't afford it, I'm not going to get it. Demand at high price point is therefore limited.

>People drop off their family members and they don’t visit them THAT often. This allows the propensity for elderly abuse because sometimes, they cannot advocate for themselves. Therefore, the quality is lower so you can pay less.

I don't disagree with you. In fact, I think you're agreeing with me. What you're saying here is that the demand is higher at lower price points, which allows lower quality places to thrive.

>Good old corporate greed.

The assumption is always that everyone will be as greedy as possible. People will try to pay the lower they can for care (as in your first point) and companies will try to pay the lowest possible wages. The intersection between supply and demand determines the price equilibrium.

>Even people that are highly educated and in great demand face illegal hiring methods like price fixing. Remember Google, Facebook, and Apple all deciding that they wouldn’t poach? Wages are SUPPRESSED because you don’t go into business not trying to make money. You make money off of the efficiency of others.

I agree entirely, which brings me to my first point. I never meant to imply everything is a free market. Just that even in a free market, there's going to be a wage cap. These are artificial ways of limiting wages more than the free market would.

>We have a resource allocation problem. People bitch and cry when their taxes are going towards health, education, or social services because “why should I subsidize another person’s benefits?” But those same people never bring up how much they spend on jailing people for bullshit or war. We have a punitive society so when the quality or cost of elderly care or ANY care for that matter is brought up, people tend to say things like “I don’t have enough money to devote to elderly care especially since they should have done so for themselves.”

Hey, you'll never have found any post of mine in my history that will argue against investment in education or against providing benefits to those who can't afford it. I may disagree with you on how to provide those benefits, but in the end, we'll agree that access to education is one of the best ways we have to provide equal opportunity for all, and that a compassionate society shouldn't allow their members to starve if they can't afford food, or die of disease because they can't afford health care.

I just wanted to describe the market forces involved, not make some kind of statement that the free market is universal in our society, nor even the free market is desirable in every aspect of society (I'm a fan of public roads). It was certainly not meant to imply a lack of compassion.

>People are dying due to the price of insulin because corporations are allowed to charge whatever they want for life saving drugs that do NOT cost that much at all.

This is a good example of why I think you need to separate understanding a free market from lack of compassion. Price controls are a bad idea. They lead to shortages. If the companies don't get what they want for insulin, they'll stop producing it in favor of more profitable drugs. Then people who need insulin will die because they can't find a pharmacy that carries the very affordable insulin.

You don't have to fight the free market to make sure everyone has insulin. We just have to agree to subsidize it for those that can't afford it (while letting those who can pay full price)."

If I own a daycare place, my goal is to keep all my costs as low as I can, including wages, and my profits as high as I can, so I'm going to increase the price as much as I can and pocket all the money.

So I've noticed what you and other people are trying to argue is, ""why won't daycare companies take smaller margins and increase wages to get more employees."" And the answer to that is that they will if and only if it leads to more paying customers that increases the overall profit.

When I say there's no demand for workers at higher wages, I didn't mean to imply it's not possible to pay workers more. But there's also no market pressure for shifting the percentages of daycare cost towards wages. Of course an increase in wages would increase daycare costs, because why wouldn't the cost be passed on to the customer?

>Equilibrium theory breaks down in a global market with infinite substitutions for labor.

That's not a breakdown, it's exactly what's predicted by the theory. It's also not what's happening at any place where a shortage of employees is reported, like daycare. By definition, if you have a shortage, you don't have infinite substitution for labor.

It's a problem, and it's a problem that's going to continue getting worse especially with automation. But you have to understand the nature of the problem to tackle it. Instead of saying, ""economic theory fails to work and people are greedy,"" realize that economic theory actually predicts these things and expects people to be greedy.

In places where salaries are stagnant, it's because they have no problem finding labor. In the unskilled labor segment, the solution is investment in higher education: we need to decrease the unskilled labor pool so companies are forced to increase wages to compete for employees. As long as they can fill all their openings at minimum wage, that's what they'll do. In cases where jobs are being offshored or replaced by automation, you're shit out of luck, and need to switch industries.

Before I get accused of being insensitive, I'd also like to point out that understanding the reality of it doesn't mean I'm not compassionate. I approve of strong social nets, because changes like these don't happen on a dime. Like John Oliver said, it's easy to say that truck driving jobs are going away, but more programmers are needed, therefore total number of jobs aren't being lost. However, you also can't tell a 50 year old truck driver losing his job to go get a computer science degree. We have to understand these challenges, and ensure people aren't going to starve or be unable to afford health care in the transition, but you can't stop the transition from happening."

AskReddit,ff3qsfu,t1_ff3pp4m,1579546845.0,">My concern here is where is all the money going?

I understand what you're saying, I'm just saying it's not relevant. Wherever the money is currently going, it's going there. Even if it's just profit, that's the amount of profit the owner is happy with, so the owner has no incentive to lowering that. If he needs to raise wages to get more employees, he's going to pass that cost on, unless some other market force forces him to lower his margin, which typically can only come in the form of competition: that is, his competitors are taking a lower margin, and therefore all the customers are going there.

From the perspective of the daycare owner, his goal is to keep all costs as low as possible, and that includes wages. His goal is to keep his profits as high as possible. So he already has increased the price of daycare as high as he can without losing customers, because if he could make more money, he would. It makes no sense to increase wages if it doesn't mean more profits, unless there's a profit benefit. If increasing wages means more employees who can take care of more kids, so he makes it up in volume, that works. If increasing wages means getting more employees and being able to take care of more kids, but he has to cut down on his margin in order to do it, then taking care of 30 kids instead of 25 for the same amount of profit as he's currently making with 25 kids, then he's better off with just being able to handle 25. Less work, same amount of money."

>Money is being made. But it is not going to wages.

That's not the point. Let's say only 1% of the money of childcare costs go to wages. If wages go up, and everything else stays the same, the price you pay still goes up, because total cost still goes up. It's like if my business is to sell phones. The cost of screws that go in the phone is a small percentage of the total cost of the phone, but if the cost of screws go up, I'm still passing it on in the cost of the phone."

That does happen in a lot of sectors, I don't disagree with you. My post wasn't meant to claim the free market exists everywhere, I was just pointing out that he had an overly simplistic view: wages aren't going to rise without bound because there's a perceived lack of people in the field unless the demand is inelastic, as you've pointed out. Which in the daycare field, it absolutely isn't. It's already considered far too expensive by most parents, it can't get any more expensive and maintain demand.

>Prices go up and wages stay stagnant, even at 3.5% unemployment.

Prices and wages go stagnant at particular sectors that are actually pretty close to a free market, and it's important to understand why in order to do know what to do about it. For instance, if McDonald's offers a minimum wage job, people take the job. If an engineering company offers a minimum wage job, engineers won't take it. These companies would love to pay engineers less...but engineers can just go seek a job in their competitors, so they need to raise wages to fill the openings. On the other hand, there isn't an unskilled labor shortage. Unemployment may be at 3.5%, but McDonald's isn't having any problems finding employees to fill their job openings.

So the solution to this is investment in higher education. We need to decrease the unskilled labor pool, so there's more competition for those jobs in that sector."

Actually, it's supply and demand for wages too.

>Following supply and demand logic the wages of these jobs should rise drastically until demand is met.

That's one side of the pressure, agreed. The other is that increased prices decrease the demand for the service. If wages rise significantly for children's daycare workers, the cost of daycare go up. If parents can no longer pay for the increased daycare costs, they start sending the children to their grandparents. Or if it rises enough to offset the monetary benefits of two parents working, one of them will quit their job instead of paying for daycare.

So the answer to your conundrum is that there's not enough supply of workers at their current wages, but not enough demand for workers at higher wages. As with everything controlled by the free market, this is the equilibrium price point."

If a poor person you know decided to donate one of their kidneys today, when they're not going to be paid for it, would you try to talk them out of it?

I assume the answer is no. Because you believe the risks associated with the medical procedure are worth the benefits to the person who will receive the organ (if I'm wrong about this, let's talk about it, because then your ethical concerns might indeed be different than mine).

If you don't have any concerns about that, exactly what changes? That person will now be rewarded for their selflessness which is good, the procedure became more expensive, which is bad. However, it will also encourage others to donate who otherwise wouldn't. If the risk is acceptable to the person who was going to donate purely to save someone's life, why isn't it acceptable to the person who will do it for money, but will *also* save someone's life? Their motivation doesn't affect the risk they will undertake. The end result is simply that more people will choose to do what I wish more people would voluntarily do anyway, and more kidneys will be available for those in need.

Now, when it's something that will affect their quality of life, it's a different story. I don't support allowing people do donate one of their eyes for money. You're putting undue economic pressure to encourage someone to accept losing vision in one eye. But then, I'm also against allowing this for purely selfish reasons.

People who donate one of their kidneys are not actually at worse health risks. According to this [page](https://www.kidney.org/news/kidneyCare/spring10/KidneyDonation), a long study found that

>Kidney donors' survival was similar to that of the general population when matched for age, sex, and race or ethnic group.

Another thing that people worry about is that if they develop kidney disease in one of their kidneys, at least they'll have a second one. However, the reality is that most of the time, they both fail simultaneously. Kidney donors are also first in line for a transplant over those who are not, so in case of failure, you'd be finding a donor sooner.

Given that we're not looking at worse quality of life here, those who decide to donate would be saving someone's life and getting compensated for it. Yes, the poor would likely do it in larger rates, but the downsides basically don't exist, save for the risks of the surgery itself, plus the pain and recovery.

As a software developer and electrical engineer, I find that they've consistently made Data have trouble with things that are very easy for computers to do, and excel at things that are extremely difficult for a computer to do, but easy for a human.

There's the contraction thing. It's difficult for data. Even without understanding the reason they arise, it can be implemented with *a lookup table*. It's trivial, chatbots do it today. Not to mention that he understands contractions when others use it, so...it's stupid.

What else can't he do. Wait, he can't whistle? [C'mon](https://www.jaquet-droz.tv/video/37529131/j899000070-the-whistling-machine), we can make mechanical whistling machines (or actual whistles). This is much harder for humans to learn than for a machine that can perfectly control its movements...and considering he can speak...

Soong said Data had problems with simple motor coordination tests, like moving one hand in a circle while tapping his head. Why would a dependency between these movements exist for a machine? In our case, certain tests like these can be hard because our brain codes for movement using [tuning curves](https://www.thenakedscientists.com/articles/questions/why-cant-human-body-multi-task): if you want to make movements in a certain direction, a cluster of nerves activate, and it doesn't matter if you're moving a hand or a leg, or which hand. You have your clockwise neurons firing the moment you're moving anything clockwise. You can definitely train yourself to be good at these things, and many of us have with games we've played as children, but basically training is required. Why are Data's movements implemented that way?

Despite these difficulties, Data has perfect dexterity in ways he shouldn't. He can pick isolinear chips up, sort them, and put them in the right place at accelerated speed. He can walk on two legs, he can run, he can play musical instruments, and paint. We still have problems making prosthetics for humans that have that fine motor control. We're just now getting to the point where humanoid robots can tackle stairs. But, ok, by the 24th century we should nail it.

Let's think of a mental ability that's easy for him, but should be hard. In A Matter of Time, he was shown listening to four musical pieces at once. To listen to several things at once and distinguish them is actually something our brains excel at: you can be at a crowded place, but you can select a voice and separate it from the whole. I can play a song and tell you, ""listen to the piano in it,"" and you can separate the part played by the piano, effortlessly.

Think about giving your Amazon Echo or Google Assistant a command while the TV is playing. I have to mute it every time. Separating sounds is a hard problem. You can run it through an FFT, and that's basically how these things can do voice IDs and recognize your voice over others, but because we're not talking about pure frequencies here, isolating it amidst other simultaneous voices is still pretty hard for computers.

Basically, they kept writing Data as a superior human, but a bad computer. In universe, you may argue that's a consequence of his positronic brain: it might be closer to how a human brain works than how the Enterprise's computer works. The problem is that even if that's the case, they've clearly given him traditional computer abilities as well: he can do exact math very quickly, for instance, which is actually not something you'd want to do with a neural network, so we should assume he has a more traditional CPU as a co-processor in there for these types of tasks."

It's not a penalty. Interest is the reason people agree to give you loans. The alternative is that if you don't have cash, you can't have an education, a car, or a home.

Irresponsible people who take out a loan they can't pay back is also the reason why interest rates go up higher.

I don't altogether oppose this, because I recognize the benefit to me as a taxpayer of having an educated population. However you do need to recognize that's a cost (or if you want to use a less negative term, an investment) on the part of the tax payer: we can't pass a law that says you pay no interest (because that removes the incentive from the banks loaning you the money), but I'm open to passing a law that taxes pay your interest. 

I'm personally willing to have my taxes increased to support that, because, again, I recognize the economic benefits, especially in the age of automation, of decreasing the unskilled labor pool. For instance, according to this [paper](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/99078/evaluating_the_return_on_investment_in_higher_education.pdf) I found after googling, recipients of food stamps fall into the categories where 64% of them have an education of high school or less whereas only 10% of them have a bachelor's or more.

I read the paper you linked. In their study, people were called and delivered a simple generic message, ""The phone call, done in free form by administrative assistants, conveys the following generic message: “Your blood type X is in short supply. Thus, it is important that you come and donate at the upcoming blood drive you have been invited for.”

It's specific to a reminder pre-blood drive, to people who have received an invitation to said blood drive already, because I imagine it's the place they work or go to school, and it's delivered in the form of a reminder.

This isn't the Red Cross phone call I'm arguing against. Look at the the rest of the thread to see examples of typical phone calls. They call you as soon as you're eligible, when you were already planning on scheduling something soon anyway. They use tactics designed to put you on the defensive such as, ""I've scheduled you for tomorrow at 8am, if that's alright with you,"" preemptively putting the onus on you to tell them to ""unschedule"" you, which aims to exploit confrontation avoidance in people. A woman gave an example that she told them she couldn't because she was pregnant, and they scheduled a second phone call exactly 9 months after. In her case, she miscarried, but even in the more common case, a new mother probably has other things to worry about at that point, and it's not going to be a good time.

If you tell them no, and that you don't know a convenient time to schedule it at the moment, they will bug you weekly into you do. I literally blocked their phone numbers because I was tired of the bs and I am a regular donor.

In the first post that you've replied to, I specifically said, ""if somebody who is a regular donor suddenly takes a longer than usual break, sure give them a call and remind them, sometimes these things fall off the radar."" I'm not opposed to them using a phone call at all, I'm opposed to the aggressive tactics which that study does not address."
todayilearned,fejnyky,t1_fej9zqe,1579181194.0,"That's a logical [fallacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reasoning).

Your argument is that they should use aggressive marketing because it's effective, and when I argue that it's not, you say it is because they wouldn't be using it if it wasn't.

Study after [study](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C41&q=pushy+salesperson+closing+rates&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3Dv3S6JeT3B7QJ) shows that aggressive salesmen have poor performance. The particular article I linked tries to explain why, since that is the case, pushy salespeople continue to be exist.

Tends to happen more often in high turnover environments, where the salesperson is worried about their job and environments where the customer is less willing to buy. Psychologically, they place an emphasis into breaking buyer resistance, and suffer from confirmation bias when they do get a sale.

The reality of Red Cross calls is that the majority of the people who get called are not going to make an appointment no matter what they say or do. There's a reason they're not donating: maybe they had a bad experience the last time, maybe they have a cold, maybe they traveled to a country that makes them ineligible, maybe they're training for a race, maybe they had sex with a prostitute, or hell, maybe they're busy and that hour out of the day is actually an hour they can't afford at the moment.

Out of those busy people, some might say, ""fine, schedule me."" This validates the salesperson belief they're effective. However, they have no way to differentiate the people who say no for the myriad of reasons I stated above from the ones who could have potentially said yes, but decided not to because of their tactics, and gave one of the above reasons as an excuse to get them off the phone. One person in this thread told the caller that he was dead to get them to stop calling, for Christ's sake.

So, ok. In this conversation we've had, I started by telling you it's not effective, I tricked you into behaving like a pressured customer to anecdotally show you why it's not effective, then I actually googled for a paper that describes both how the tactic isn't effective and explains why it's still used. Are you going to accept you're wrong now, or are going to continue saying, ""nuh uh!"" as your argument?"

That works...but it's miserable, and it's slow to progress.

A system like the one in the link has you running for short periods, and mostly walking in the beginning, for a total of 30 minutes. As a result, you never feel like you're dying, you never get to the point where you're so tired you can't run another step. Because you're alternating walking and running, you also kept a high heart-rate for a full 30 minutes, which you wouldn't have been able to do if you were just running until exhaustion, so you progress quicker.

If you need to do a procedure soon, don't switch your health insurance, because if you have no money in the HSA right now, that lower deductible in your current insurance is going to be better for you.

Once you get your current issues taken care of, look into that when planning for the future, though. It shouldn't increase your current burden at all because you can pay the same amount you're paying now except part of it will go to the lower premium and the rest you should put into your HSA (you've got to make sure you follow this step). Once your HSA builds up enough funds, the stress of unexpected medical expenses will go away because it should start generating enough cash to cover it.

If you don't have a high deductible insurance plan, switch to one. It'll be a cheaper premium, pay the difference between what you're paying now into the HSA. Invest the money into an index fund.

The capital gains from the HSA is tax free, and you can use the money from that account for medical purposes without penalty.

technology,fe31n2o,t1_fe08w81,1578845083.0,">The FBI is asking for a backdoor with a key for them to use which will unlock any iphone. 

They are not, look at the request. This is about unlocking two phones they have a warrant for, which are already locked and encrypted. Backdoors can't be added to encryption after the data is locked. If that was possible, then all encryption would be useless.

>So for your idea on flash a version of the OS to remove the 10 strikes and your out. I do not know all the ins and outs of the iphone, but generally the OS doesn't handle the encryption, something else does.

I don't know what you mean by this. If you mean it has encryption hardware, it does, but the OS is what interfaces with it. But again, this isn't about the encryption at all, it's about not triggering the data deletion after repeated failure password attempts, which is absolutely what the OS does.

>If that was the case, then any iphone could be unlocked already. We can easily flash flash iphones to change out the OS and such. 

Need to change it to an OS that will allow you to brute force the unlocking mechanism. That can be done without Apple, but not that easily, because the bootloader is locked and the firmware is signed. The iphone won't boot an OS that hasn't been signed by Apple. Now, jailbreaking exists, and when there are exploits that allow for the flashing it can be done...which is how the FBI got another company to unlock the previous phone Apple refused to help them with.

>We can easily flash flash iphones to change out the OS and such. The problem is keeping the data once you clear everything.

You update your phone's OS every time without deleting data. That's not a challenge.

>Yes Apple COULD do it, but they won't.

If the password is strong, they actually can't unlock it, no. If Apple has a key to unlock passwords, then they already have a backdoor. They don't, so that's really the only thing the FBI is asking for, not a backdoor.

>Doing so would allow bad people to get access to things they shouldn't have access to.

Not if they ask for a warrant before doing so! That's the point of warrants. If the police want to search a home and they don't show cause and get it signed off by a judge, that's bad people doing things. If they have the evidence necessary to get a warrant first, that's a very good thing, it's how the system is supposed to work.

>It is 100% a lawful request, and it is 100% lawful to reject

It really isn't. They happened to drop it last time because another company managed to unlock the phone for them, but if this actually goes to court, Apple will lose. As they should. They'd be obstructing justice.

>the government shouldn't be in the business in setting security policies for companies 

100% agreed.

>or forcing a human to upload a piece of software to their hardware.

They don't have to do it, they can provide the means to. This isn't self-incrimination, they're not the ones being investigated. The government absolutely has the right to compel you to turn in any knowledge you have which would help in an investigation. It's actually **better** if Apple does it, becausue otherwise they'll just be compelled to give the FBI the means to, and then they'll start abusing it and using it on phones they don't have a warrant for.

>Your suggest, which could be very possible as is with all current iphones, is just as bad as a back door.

It is not, because you have full control of it. You choose the convenience of using a weak password that makes it impossible for the phone to be unlocked by the average phone thief, or you choose to use a complicated strong password that is government proof. If you have a strong password that can't be brute-forced, Apple can't unlock it. They'll flash the software, they'll run pin combinations or dictionary attacks, fail, and that's that."
technology,fe04azx,t1_fdxeads,1578802724.0,">But the FBI is asking them to put like a 2nd password on EVERY phone that the FBI knows.

That's not what they're asking now, and it's not what they were asking for the last time. They're not asking for a backdoor. Case in point, you can't retroactively add a backdoor into a phone that was encrypted without a backdoor in the encryption already.

Now, it's often the case that the government does argue for a law that requires companies to add backdoors. And I'm completely on your side that this would be dangerous, not to mention unethical.

>Yeah they technically can't open up a phone right now.

Which leads us to what they are asking for. By default, unless you've chosen to make your password stronger, we're taking 4 digit pins. Even if it's a longer password, people often use dictionary words, or a variation of them. The strength of the encryption and lack of a backdoor isn't the weakness, a bad password is.

So let's say that as unbreakable as the encryption algorithm is, it's unlockable with a 4 digit code. You could run through all 10,000 numbers, 0000 through 9999 very quickly. What's stopping the FBI from doing that is that the phones are set to erase themselves after a set number of wrong guesses, I think 10 is the default. So they'd like Apple to flash a version of the iOS into those specific phones that they have a warrant to search, so that they won't do that. And if they can also enable it so it will go through the search space and have the computer do the brute force search, even better (especially if they need a dictionary attack because it could be a weak password, but not so weak as 4 digits).

So, just like last time, this is a completely reasonable request, and completely lawful. It's like catching a criminal, noticing he has a safe that is booby trapped to destroy the contents if you try to break into it, getting a warrant for searching the safe, and then asking the company that makes the safe for help getting past that booby trap. They're not asking the company to start adding a known safe combination to every safe they sell, because that wouldn't help with the safes they've already sold, like the ones they have a warrant to search.

I'm as outraged as you guys when we have the government arguing for backdoors, but let's be reasonable when they are actually doing what they're supposed to. This is not an illegal search, it's not a fishing expedition, it's the actual situation warrants are for."

AskReddit,fd5j5k2,t1_fd4ri5r,1578178166.0,">If all humans were born inherently selfish, how would the world be today?

Let's say you're in a world with people with no society at all. Everyone is selfish. The first thing that happens is you realize anyone stronger than you are is going to take your stuff, and murder you if necessary because you try to defend your food and/or possessions.

So you realize that you don't want to live your life in constant fear, and enter a pact with a group of people who also, selfishly, don't want to live in fear. They don't care about you, because they're purely selfish. But they agree to not steal your stuff, and to help protect you and your stuff from those outside your society, if you agree to do the same.

Congratulations, you've just formed a very simple social contract, with concepts of the rights of life and property, purely out of selfish reasons.

Now if you extend that concept, you can include more and more rules in your social contract, for mutual benefit. And the only reasons those rules are obeyed is because you can enforce them with violence. That's why we have police. That's why we have military forces.

Now, the reality is that people do have empathy. I don't *want* to hurt anyone else, and it's not a law that's preventing me from doing so. But that's also a ""selfish"" response. I feel bad when people I empathize with suffer, and I don't want to feel bad.

Empathy also only takes you so far. Because the more different someone is from you, the harder it is to empathize with them. This is why you have so many people wanting to call homosexuality immoral and unnatural. The majority of people aren't attracted to the same sex, and that makes it harder to empathize with those who do. The best way to solve that is to actually introduce those people who are the 'other'. You befriend someone you consider different than you, you start to find everything you have in common, and then you go, ""hey, they're just like me and overall swell people.

On the other side of the spectrum, it's why demonization works. You start to convince people that a certain group is not like them, they want all these things that are not compatible with their society...suddenly, people no longer empathize with them, they no longer feel bad over their suffering, and can commit terrible atrocities, or stop defending the idea that they should have the same rights you do.

Sure, if you're threatening via the Internet while presently able to immediately carry out that threat, it's assault. I concede that point."
DaystromInstitute,fd2xi9o,t1_fd2svmq,1578152689.0,">I like this because I've never liked the ""Kirk vs Picard"" debates. Both captains are good in certain situations.

Exactly. In fact, if I'm an admiral, I'd like to have both types of captains in my fleet. Their assignments seems to reflect that too. Picard's assignment on the Enterprise put him in a position where he was constantly acting as diplomat and arbiter. In the 23rd century, Kirk was the type of Captain they picked to go on a 5 year mission of exploration.

If you're going to be handling the unknown on a daily basis, far from starbases and support, you may need to make good snap decisions, and adapt quickly if those decisions are wrong. Kirk is amazing here. If you're mainly handling equally challenging situations, but with people where we can give you long dossiers on their culture and the history of ongoing and previous conflicts, Picard will excel. They can both do each other's jobs, but they were also perfectly suited to their assignments, so the admiralty likely recognized that as well."

You're right about the legality of it. You're not right that the crime is assault. In this case, the crime would be harassment.

>The statement ""you can't assault someone over the internet"" is factually false.

No, it's not. Like he said, assault isn't just whether the threat is viable, it's whether the threat is *present*. It's whether you think you might be harmed *right now* and are considering your escape or self-defense options.

The distinction is important, especially in the US where you might have a gun to defend yourself. If you're being assaulted, you might be able to defend yourself with that gun. If you're being threatened over the internet and you decide to drive over to that person's house with your gun to scare them off, you're the one doing the assaulting and will get fucked in court."
DaystromInstitute,fcztnz6,t1_fczqxi2,1578108423.0,"I think we're saying the same thing. I perhaps used the wrong words when I said he has to fail...but he generally can't be simply talked out of his position.

I'm not saying Kirk is inflexible. In fact, I cited Errand of Mercy as one of my examples as well. He had to be shown to be wrong by the Organians, he had to be shown to be wrong about the Gorn. It's the fact that he was single mindedly determined, as you've put it, that I'm referring to.

By comparison, Picard is the one who can be be argued out of a position *before* he acts. Before he starts making decisions. In fact, he prefers it that way. He'll talk to his crew, he'll play devil's advocate. It's only after he feels that he gave every viewpoint a fair shake that he makes a call.

Kirk is more likely to make a snap judgement, and he'll stick to it until something happens that forces him to consider it. The Organians had to force the fighting to stop before he considered he was being as bloody thirsty as the Klingons. The Gorn told Kirk they acted in self defense, and he instead called him a butcher: it was only when he was about to kill him that he cooled off enough to consider what he was told, that maybe he was speaking the truth.

Now, I'm not saying this makes Kirk inferior, it just makes him a better Captain in different situations than Picard. Kirk's decisiveness is great when in situations where you don't have the time to carefully consider all options. He'll act quickly, and his instincts are usually pretty good. But if there's time, you would rather have the captain who uses it to carefully evaluate all aspects of the situation before potentially making it worse."

Very good graphics and animations for the era. Fantastic music. And incredibly original level design that keeps the gameplay fresh.

Very first level, you get the awesome punch animation. In addition to the just the two buttons, you get extra mocha l moves because you can do double tap forward to run and hit button while running to headbutt enemy. You can pick up the metal leg of one of the enemies and use it as a weapon. You can hop on top of the flying pigs and control them. The boss fight is fought from the perspective of the boss, which you never see. How creative is that?

Then you get to the second level, and now it's a vertical level where you're descending from a rope. Which can be cut by some enemies. You get additional moves by attacking from near a wall.

Then you get to the third level. You get a new fight animation to keep things fresh and now you kick some of the enemies. You have an enemy that harms you by literally steals your health from the health bar, again, awesomely creative. You get on a speeder and again have an entirely new gameplay dynamic, as now it's an obstacle dodging race level.

Then you get ice level. You have to worry about sliding. You fight some enemies by getting into a snowball fight with them.

Then you get a surfing level, similar obstacle avoiding race level, but the dynamics of the vehicle and the nature of the obstacles are different. Hilarious sumo-wrestler rat as a boss.

Then you get a level where you need to ride snakes.

Then you get a level that feels more fast paced from the beginning because you're one-punching enemies to death. Some of them can one-hit you to death too. Another vehicle section, this time an airplane.

Then a vehicle platforming level...and so on. The game is *always* fresh and original, and yes, it's really hard to play. But even as a kid, I never got angry with it, because every time you lose, it feels like the challenge is just a little bit bigger than the last thing you've successfully accomplished. It's just out of reach, and you know you can do it with some practice.

DaystromInstitute,fccou7s,t3_eh0p9b,1577600891.0,"I agree with many of your points such as Kirk having an adventurer spirit, being exceedingly cunning, and on the downside part, I agree that he developed a bit of an ego. I'm not sure that I would agree with him being reckless, but your refined definition as an answer to another poster is mostly something I agree on: he does takes risks most others wouldn't in the same position as him. That said, I wouldn't call that reckless because of another of your points: he knows the odds. A reckless person doesn't understand the risks, or doesn't care. In Kirk's case, he thought the risks were worthwhile for what he was trying to accomplish. It's not that he was more reckless than others, it's that he has a different value system than most.

Here's my analysis of his strengths and weaknesses as compared to Picard:

If you're going to be in a situation where a fight is unavoidable, send Kirk. If you think it's possible to talk your way out of it, send Picard. I'm not saying Kirk is incapable of finding a way to avoid a fight, nor am I saying that Picard is incapable of handling himself in one. But Kirk is a tactical genius and Picard is an accomplished diplomat. They each excel at those different tasks.

We've seen how Kirk dealt in battle against the Romulans in Balance of Terror, and in a similar battle against the Reliant in Wrath of Khan. We've seen him handle superior opponents such as against The Doomsday Machine. We've seen him engage in guerilla warfare in Errand of Mercy. We've seen him best Spock in 3D chess. 

For the most part, when such situations occurred in TNG, Riker was responsible for the battle tactics. Riker came up with the strategy to rescue Picard from the Borg, Riker thought to ask Worf for weaknesses in the Duras' old bird of prey and ask Data if it could be exploited, Riker was the one who used the gas in the briar patch against superior opponents. The Picard maneuver is required reading at the academy, but Riker is the one who managed to beat Picard when he used it against him, in such a way that he didn't need to destroy the ship.

On the other hand, diplomacy. Yes, Kirk routinely successfully called bluffs from gods and other opponents, bluffed his own was into success, negotiated settlements and avoided a fight. But he always did so in a confrontational manner. He has no patience, no tolerance. He got the mobsters in A Piece of the Action to work together by literally taking over with superior force and getting a percentage. He got the city dwellers in Ardana to supply the miners with safety masks by literally kidnapping the government leader and forcing him to breathe the fumes to make his point that this is what made the Troglytes violent. He gets his way by forcing the other side's hands, not by convincing them.

Picard on the other hand tends to find compromises acceptable to all, on their terms. The Sheliak are inflexible in the interpretation of their contracts? He finds a clause that gives him the additional time he needs to evacuate because the contract allowed for arbitration. The Jarada are extremely strict in protocol? He spends hours learning the correct pronunciation in their difficult language to abide by that protocol. He gets kidnapped and put in a planet with the captain of another ship and they don't speak the same language? He learned enough from they encounter that when that Captain died, he was able to avoid a fight by using what he learned and speaking their language to the other crew members of that ship. He doesn't force his way like Kirk, he adapts to the way of those he are dealing with.

So, as far as disadvantages go, where does that leave us? Honestly, Picard handles his weaknesses much better. He seeks the help of the experts in order to make his decisions. When somebody else points out that he's wrong, he has enough self awareness to examine if their claim has merit and change his mind when it does.

Kirk...not so much. He's willing to admit that he's wrong, but you can't talk him into that belief, he has to fail first. He told the crew he did nothing except get caught with his britches down, and that Saavik should go on quoting regulations...but only after the Reliant almost destroyed the Enterprise as a result of that mistake. He blamed himself for hesitating in an attack against the Gaseous Entity and cost his previous Captain his life...and despite being told that they didn't even know if phasers were going to work against it and he couldn't blame himself, he kept doing so until he confirmed phasers don't work. The Organians pointed out that he had a hostile mindset and he kept insisting that it was simply because the Klingons couldn't be negotiated with, until he found himself screaming at them for stopping a war, right alongside Kor, both on the same side wanting the chance to destroy the other. For that matter, he refused to take the Klingon negotiations for peace at their word until the Klingon Chancellor died in his arms, pleading to not let the effort end that way.

So, Picard is more flexible and therefore the one you want most of the time, of there's any chance at all of a peaceful resolution. Kirk can and has gotten us peaceful resolutions, but really, his approach will be to try to force the hand of whoever he's negotiating with, either through strength or a bluff. He's unlikely to see beyond his own preconceptions unless he's bitten by them, which limits his negotiating ability. However, if negotiation isn't an option, he's the most likely to find a way to win, no matter the odds."

I agree with that statement, and do miss the more detailed dungeons in past games.

I love botw, but to be perfectly clear, I'm not trying to argue that you're wrong for not enjoying it. It's perfectly valid to have different tastes and preferences than I do. I'm also not arguing that all changes were positive. The thing I am arguing against is that it doesn't fit with the franchise. It definitely felt like a zelda game, and honestly, the mechanics changes were more incremental than people are making it out to be: less emphasis on dungeons to the overworld experience, durability on weapons and shields, and cooking. That's about it. Other than that, it stuck to the formula.

>I felt like I figured the game out too early on so there was nothing to look forward to and things felt v samey from that point on

I felt like that from time to time, I get it. Once in a while, you find something while exploring that gives you an interesting challenge. For instance, I spent a long time just beating the Trial of the Sword. If you don't care about exploring, there's a fairly straight-forward path to beating the game without side-quests too. Get the paraglider, go to Kakariko village, visit the four great beasts, go fight ganon. All the stuff marked on the map, and fairly linear other than that the order you choose for the beasts doesn't matter."
todayilearned,fcc35gx,t1_fcbtjte,1577593878.0,">The original was aimless, but otherwise worked like all other zelda games in terms of dungeons and items/weapons.

So does botw. The dungeons are a bit on the short side compared to previous zelda games, and the weapon durability mechanic is new, but those are fairly incremental changes. Every zelda game tends to introduce some change in mechanics. For instance, the finite stamina in botw was actually introduced with skyward sword.

Everything else pretty much behaves the same way. Combat involves z-targeting and defensive stances. Items include different clothing which helps in different situations such as water or extreme heat, which is similar to the tunic mechanics in previous games, it includes the classics like the master sword, bombs (although we do have limitless bombs in botw, which compensates for the breakable weapons and shields, I think). You've got the paraglider which is similar to the sailcloth, you have bow and arrows, etc.

I'm not saying every change is positive, or even that people who don't like the game are wrong in some way. In fact, I definitely prefer longer and more varied dungeons to the shrines and small divine beast challenges. Everybody has different tastes, and it's perfectly fine. The only thing I'm arguing against is the idea that this game doesn't fit in the zelda franchise and was somehow shoehorned in. It definitely felt like zelda to me."

Portuguese: Não falo inglês.

Spanish: No hablo ingles

Italian: Le sfide nella sfida sono molteplici: cosa va rimosso, innanzitutto.

Spanish: ""Los desafíos en el desafío son múltiples: lo que debe eliminarse, en primer lugar.""

If I'm speaking to someone from Portugal, I might struggle a bit with their accent, sure. However, if I'm reading something written by someone from Portugal, I might not even notice it's not Brazilian Portuguese until I hit upon a word that is used differently or a particular regional saying that we don't share. Those are rare enough that I could possibly go full paragraphs before noticing it. The language is unquestionably the same.

I can communicate with someone who speaks Spanish fairly easily. That is, we're both willing to speak slowly, and make different word choices when we notice the other doesn't understand something. Written language, also easier to understand, but now I'm not going to mistake it for Portuguese at any point. Almost every word is different, even if they are similar enough that I can figure out the portuguese equivalent. Some words are completely different, and even very misleading.

I see those analogies often, but here's why they're not applicable to an alien species capable of interstellar travel: all that life we destroy without a second thought? It's in our way.

Our planet looks awfully cozy, and you might think that it's valuable to aliens because of all the oxygen, water, minerals, whatever resources you think we might have that's valuable. You might think we're in their way to colonizing or harvesting it. Except none of that is valuable at all to a species capable of coming to us from another star. Hydrogen and oxygen are the first and third most common elements in the universe respectively. Even in water form, there's way more of it in Saturn's rings then there is in our tiny planet. They can grab other minerals from asteroids, or other rocky planets. Most importantly, if they can generate the energy to come all this distance, they can easily harvest all of that stuff with zero problems, and without needing to waste time cleaning out the life infestation here...or traveling light-years to get here in the first place.

With that in mind, here's a more apt analogy to an alien species being hostile to us. Imagine that you really want some sand, and you're currently on a beach. But instead of scooping up the sand under your feet, you take a ship to the Mariana Trench, go all the way down to the bottom with an advanced submarine, kill any ocean-life that you see on the way down, and scoop sand from the ocean floor once you reach it.

Turns out you're not going to do that, because it's a waste of time and resources. If you do make the insane effort to visit the Mariana Trench, it's not to get resources which are much more easily found elsewhere. It's to study the area and the unusual life forms that live there, in which case you tend to be very careful not to mess up their environment and to treat it with respect...like the human scientists who do that.

If aliens show up on Earth, they're not going to be hostile. It's not because it's impossible that superior intelligence beings exist which don't give a shit about us, but simply because Earth has nothing to offer them that they can't more easily get elsewhere, and we're certainly not getting in their way: we're way out of the way. Anyone that does make the effort is necessarily interested in studying and preserving what they find."
