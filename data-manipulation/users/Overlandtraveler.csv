Good luck! If you want to chat, please DM, I am always happy to talk. I also had an unrelated bone marrow transplant in 2012."

What will these ""Insta models"" , ""Insta Make up artists"", ""Insta whatevers"" going to do once the hype wears down? All fads die eventually.

What will be the next ""cool"" thing that will be beyond the ""Insta"" whatever people?"

solotravel,ff9k4ri,t1_ff8aii0,1579714708.0,"No, not as a single woman in India, that IS NOT a good idea.

You will have only 3 weeks, which is the equivalent of 1 week in the West. India is much, much slower, hotter, humid and bit as socially advanced as the West. 

I am a white woman who lived India for a year, and outside of Bombay or Delhi, maybe Darjeeling, respectable women don't frequent bars alone. It is viewed as something trashy, and not safe as a white solo traveler. Please don't do it.

Coffee houses, chai houses, those sorts of places are ok for white women, but pay attention. India is it's own world, and it takes a good 3-4 weeks just to acclimate, yet alone worry about meeting other travelers."
solotravel,ff9jm48,t1_ff7x17k,1579714400.0,"Not in India, she should NOT go to the local pub! 

In general, outside of big cities in India, women don't go to local pubs, and it could be very dangerous for her to do so. Bars in many small villages in India are not safe for a solo traveling white woman.

I lived in India for a year, am a white woman, and I would never recommend a woman do that.

Her best bet would be coffee shops, chai spots, beaches and all. Public places that accommodate travelers, depending on where she is headed."

I feel like it has to do with level of education and socio-economic status. 

Please add the ""ly"" when it should be there."
