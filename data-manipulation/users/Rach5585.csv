But I don't understand the problem with big families and homeschooling. Our school systems are so screwed up. In my neighborhood a girl was sexually assaulted on the bus to school by a group of boys, and I live in one of the best districts. My friend teaches in the district and kids are on pills, they get caught with drugs very often, and every other week you hear about some teacher touching some kid.

She's destructive because she's bored, they are very, very smart dogs.

We taught her to play hide and go seek. She went camping and canoeing with us, and when I had to put her down it was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do, but she was loved to her last breath.

We live on five acres of land though, I would not recommend them for apartment dwellers. They'll destroy everything.

I was brought up being taught that it's never wrong to be kind, and I see wearing a pride button not as a ”celebration of sin” (something many of my Christian friends say it represents), but as a symbol of two things, one, that LGBT are safe with me, and two, that God vowed not to destroy ever flood the Earth again.
