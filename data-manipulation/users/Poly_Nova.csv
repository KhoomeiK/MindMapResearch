Welding,fdlj7tc,t1_fdlhkoq,1578525215.0,"I think I got faster progressively as my welds were layered. Also what could be mistaken as strikes are flying liquid metal when people are cutting. (The teacher lets kids cut the metal and you have to grind all the crap off since they’re beginners). I was using  a miller machine at my school , and my voltage was set at 108.

SuicideWatch,fda5ld3,t3_ek6g0j,1578241999.0,"Dear all the comments: the world is filled with fake asshole, don’t trust anyone until you’ve known them well enough. Filter through it. 

I’ve made many regrets and mistakes but just remember that mistakes are a learning experience. I’ve made lots of social fuckups and family fuckups but leave it all behind  

If you have toxic family, just remember that you have the right to cut them out of your life, (if you are an adult). If you are being abused, call child protective services. 

All the mistakes you’ve made in the past are building blocks for the future, ive attempted before. Until I learned how to cut people out of my life and keep the good ones tightly. I found myself in hobbies that are beneficial to the future. If you’re in high school, focus on your grades. Seriously. It’ll matter. 

Just remember, you need to filter through the fake assholes and find the people that really care about you, and keep them tightly."

SuicideWatch,fc666d2,t3_egag8h,1577473173.0,"High school has plenty of electives to find whatever you enjoy. Whether it be art, music, or welding/energy life skills (high paying jobs!). School is boring, yes but If you like the electives you could totally make a big career out of it! Keep grades up in high school, you could get a scholarship (get paid thousands!) and get a good job because of it. Don’t lose hope."
