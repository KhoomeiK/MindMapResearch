justneckbeardthings,ffbvqn5,t1_ffbtzhr,1579784375.0,"Absolutely this. Regular bathing, proper bathing, and being in good health honestly can allow you to largely get away without deodorant (though I still very much recommend it).

Having been to a bunch of raves, as well as a bunch of Magic the Gathering tournaments, i'll tell you that a whole bunch of sweaty people in a small enclosed area, all of whose deodorant wore off hours ago, can actually smell pretty okay. But it doesn't matter how much deodorant you put on if you haven't showered in three days and don't wipe your ass properly, you still create a 10-foot-radius biohazard zone even in the most well ventilated convention centre.

Huh. In Canada, though it varies by province, you can generally start working a ""real job"" at the age of 14, with the restriction that you can't work more than 3 hours on a school day. Also, kids can start doing odd-job type work like babysitting and farm labour for pay even earlier. I got my first job, picking strawberries, when I was 8.

How do you know the motivations of animals? How do you know that any person other than yourself is sentient and not simply a biological automaton?

Personally, I am willing to give most animals the benefit of the doubt on sentience, though I get a little more skeptical when talking about, say, fruit flies. But yes, I've got more compassion for a chimpanzee than for a frog. Sentience, self-awareness, and sapience can be a sliding scale."

Yes, they theoretically escape on turn four, but that requires you to have perfect mana and also halfway skip either turn 2 or 3, which sounds like a big ask in limited.

Also, an escaped titan seems like a much less locked-in wincon than KbtSG. I just feel like KbtSG (given its functional evasion) wins the game 95% of time that you have it along with 7 mana, while this titans win the game about 80% of the time that you have them and the perfect mix of coloured mana. Especially given the lack of good fixing in this set, that seems like it balances out in favour of KbtSG.

Further, I feel like people having enchantment removal after page 1 of KbtSG is not going to be any more common than people having gravehate for pre-escape titans, given the cards we have available.

Old is a legitimate concern. White and male are just identity politics. They shouldn't really count against him, but the fact that the six candidates who made it to the January debate stage are all white and two thirds male is a pretty big indictment of the system as a whole.

I am absolutely pulling for Bernie, but it's not like his voice doesn't exist in more diverse bodies. Those bodies just don't make it this far in the process, and it would be really nice to correct that. I would have zero problems with a white male candidate, if he was the best choice, in a world where female POC candidates were just as likely to get a real shot.

Wellthatsucks,fegllew,t1_feghhzr,1579096534.0,"Recently got back from a 150-plus mile hike myself, my second in as many years. I wore trail running shoes both times. The first time, my feet looked like hamburger by the end, but the second time I escaped without a single blister.

The trick, for me at least, was to start caring for your feet as though they are falling apart from the morning of day one, rather than not really worrying about it until a blister appears. That meant wrapping all ten toes with medical tape and then coating my feet fully in vaseline every morning before putting my socks on (yes, this feels a little gross while you're doing it, but it doesn't feel gross at all once their on). It also meant that, as soon as I felt the slightest bit of discomfort or rubbing anywhere, I would stop, take a ten minute break, and stick a blister pad to the affected area *before* the blister developed."

AskReddit,fefdjnw,t1_fed4mkh,1579054010.0,"I live in Montreal, which is almost certainly the most bilingual part of Canada. Basically everyone in the city speaks at least some English and at least some French and there is an interesting sort of dance that happens when you're having a conversation with a stranger, where you both say ""Bonjour hi"" and then sorta just talk at each other in a mix of both languages until you figure out which is the optimal one for your combined skill levels. In fact, because most people are better at understanding their second language than they are speaking it, I've had plenty of conversations that essentially boiled down to me speaking English at someone and them speaking French back at me, and we both understood the conversation just fine."

Second, Apologizing for being new/bad at stand-up is almost always a mistake at the start of your set, though it's fine if you work it into a punchline. You can skip that setup and jump straight into ""Stand-up comedy is like sex.""

I think the abortion joke suffers a bit from being low-hanging fruit (which is okay when you're starting out), but is also way too long for what it offers. I'd consider something more like ""I grew up in Alabama and it was hammered into me that abortion is the biggest sin, the highway to hell. But now that I've spent more time outside of the state I've totally reversed my viewpoint. Today I think that abortion should be mandatory....      In Alabama.""

Most of the basketball stuff is bad, I'm afraid, but I like the virginity joke. Maybe shorten it to just ""I play on a rec league basketball team and we're real bad.

magicTCG,feeqz4j,t3_eoobxt,1579039343.0,">Anything is possible in Magic if you make it expensive enough. Where should Oko have fallen?

What's the appropriate CMC for a creature with an ETB that just reads ""You win the game""?

Hint: There isn't one.

EDIT: ITT, people missing my point. I'm simply saying that magic has enough ways to get around CMC that not all effects can be balanced by turning just that one knob. For the example of Emrakul specifically, yes he basically wins you the game if you cast him (the word ""cast"" is important) and resolve him. But he also has a bunch of other text specifically directed at making it so that you almost always have to actually spend the 15 mana to get the full benefit from him. A 0/1 with ""When \~ enters the battlefield, you win the game"" and no other abilities would be way more broken than Emrakul even at 99 CMC.

 EDIT #2: Or imagine a card (of any type) with the ability ""Discard this card: You win the game."" What's the right CMC for that?"

Scenario 8: My opponent cast's Befuddle with Evra's ability on the stack. I activate Evra's ability again in response....

Evra's ability resolves. Evra's power becomes 40, my life total becomes 4.

Befuddle resolves. Evra's power becomes 36.

I can now activate Evra's ability *for a third time*, correct? And in that scenario (assuming no further actions) I end up dealing 36 damage with Evra, killing my opponent, and going back to 40 life?"

I'm at 40 life and attack opponent #1 with a 4/4 Evra. No blockers are declared, so during the declare blocker's step I activate Evra's ability. Then...

Scenario 1: Nobody responds. My opponent is dead from commander damage and I'm at 44 life.

Scenario 2: My opponent casts \[\[Doom Blade\]\] with Evra's ability on the stack and no-one responds. Evra dies and I'm still at 40 life, right?

Scenario 3: My opponent lets Evra's ability resolve *and then* casts Doom Blade. Nobody responds. Evra dies and I'm at 4 life.

Scenario 4: My opponent lets Evra's ability resolve *and then* casts Doom Blade. I activate Evra's ability again in response. Nobody responds further. Evra dies and I'm at 40 life. (Repeat as necessary if further instant speed removal is cast in response.)

Scenario 5: My opponent casts \[\[Befuddle\]\] with Evra's ability on the stack. Nobody responds further. I'm dead.

Scenario 6: My opponent casts \[\[Befuddle\]\] with Evra's ability on the stack. I activate Evra's ability again in response. Nobody responds further. My opponent takes 4 commander damage and I'm at 40 life.
