Parenting,ffkg6cc,t3_eu3fw2,1580022229.0,"I think it’s best to be honest and keep everything aired out. In today’s day and age of dna tests like 23and Me of Ancestry.com, he could get some big and hurtful surprises if you kept it from him.  
My mother-in-law recently discovered that her dad she grew up believing was her biological father was not her biological father. And he too died believing he was her father.  She found out through a dna test that she was not 99% Jewish but was in fact mostly Italian and a mix bag of other heritages.  Her mother is still living but they have no relationship.  Long story short, she found out that her mother had an affair.  Finding out that her dad was not her biological father really effed her up."

My spouse and I are in a similar situation.  The comfort of being together has turned into eating all the time and too much junk.  When I read your post I actually wondered if it was my man. 
I’ve never felt like keto was a good lifestyle.  There isn’t enough balance and you end up feeling deprived then rebound by eating way too much sugar and carbs. 
You need balance."
