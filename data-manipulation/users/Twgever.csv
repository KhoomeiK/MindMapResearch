offmychest,fejsajo,t1_feivjub,1579184613.0,"ok then, but if what you say is true, why is there such a discrepancy between the US and the other countries? If the fault is not in the guns, then the fault must be of the US population, which, in order to respect this theory, must have the highest percentage of insane/crazy/stupid people, compared to other countries, and by a lot. If that is the case, then, how did this people came in possession of a gun? if the american gun selling policy is so strict?
and one more thing, what is the difference in perpetrating a mass shooting with a handgun than to doing it with any other gun?

I'm not saying that firearm owners are evil, I'm just saying that guns control should be more strict. Of course there must be lots of people that own a gun and are also very nice, but there have been also lots of people that abused of the gun's power."

Now, first point: I provided wikipedia because it's a generic source. Yeah, it can be edited by anybody, but as soon as you modify something, if the information you added is not real, they will delete it.

And i think you skipped a little detail. Everything that is said on wikipedia is supported by dozens of links to the various sources. Just look at he references on the first article i linked (i suppose you accidentally forgot, since i have great expectations in your brain activity). there are 84 of them.

this is the reference about the graph i mentioned, it is an article from the ""America journal of medicine"".

Meanwhile, at the end of the second link, you can see like 400 references, supporting what is written on the actual page. probably wikipedia is not great about learning math or history, but everything that is said on it, is supported by references.

&#x200B;

third point: the fact that I, in your opinion, did not provide actual sources, does not imply that you're not supposed to make me see YOUR (since you like the caps lock so much)source. It just doesn't make sense.

&#x200B;

fourth point:please, stop answering only small phrases from my answers, it just makes it harder to speak with you. Do you have a problem with reading the whole thing? are you able to connect the various thing I say and answer each one of them? Pleas tell me"
offmychest,fei03y6,t1_fehz36n,1579127393.0,"i have a clue about the value of human life, and how it is preferable saving even a killer's life, if possible, and I say *possible*. if the guy is literally on you you're free to shoot them in the chest, and face the consequences. It is certainly better fatally shooting them if they're in contact with you, other than aiming directly at the head when they're meters away.

just do not abuse the power that the gun gives you. It is easy to pull a trigger on a thief, but random thieves are, quite often, unarmed, and unwilling to harm, since that would cause even more problems."

dude, fucking stop with the hate speech, are you able to speak with someone without feeling empowered by the fact that you have a keyboard?telling the first idiot you meet that they're ignorant does not make you intelligent

so, if kids nowadays knew the basics of firearm safety, there would be less people killing other people?that's how you justify school shootings (which are intentional) and homicides (which are intentional)?

and since I provided you sources, could you please provide me sources about kids learning the basics of firearm security in the US?"
offmychest,fehylpg,t1_fehxew5,1579126488.0,"killing a man with a knife when you have a gun is a clear abuse of power. you can easily incapacitate him by shooting him elsewere. The pain caused by a gunshot is enough to cause the aggressor to stumble, allowing you to take a better shot in order to incapacitate him."

i just don't understand why you're being so aggressive when i answered you politely and always supported my thesis reasonably.

&#x200B;

this is just an example. there is a graph which shows how the gun caused-deaths are in USA, compared to other countries. And this is just an example, internet and news are always highlighting how, in America, there are more gun related deaths than in the rest of the world.

this is a list of the school shootings that occurred in the US. Now,  not all of these caused the death of people, but still, there have been like 100 school shootings in the US in the last tow decades, and 3 of them just in 2020, which just began. Even China suffered less school shootings, and in China there is like twice the population that there is in the US.

&#x200B;

I don't think that this is a stupid fucking argument, since, as you can see, the evidence are tangible, both about the school shootings (and it is more likely to be hit in a school shootings than to die by a lighting 3,696 deaths were recorded in the U.S. between 1959 and 2003, meaning that there have been like 44 deaths per year, and, only in 2019, there have been 48 school shootings(which, ok, were not all about kids entering school with guns)) and about the guns misusage in the US.

now please, if you really think that my thesis is a stupid fucking argument, tell me what else could cause this evident problem, other than guns being sold much much easier than in other countries. Absence of an answer will be perceived as a ""you're right, almighty redditor""."

And ok, self-defense excuse allowed, how do you justify the selling of firearms in supermarkets? I mean, I don't live in the USA, but I read some news about supermarkets selling firearms. I mean, in Italy in order to own a guna, you must have a license, and guns cannot be found that easily, there are not as much gun's shops as in the USA, and the result is that we had 1 ore less school shootings in decades, not to mention other situation in which guns are used to harm people. Very few people keep a gun in their drawer, implying that kids are less likely to cause a gun accident, implying that teenager are less likely to sneak out their parents gun etc.
It's not about owning a gun, it's about who owns a gun and how the gun is sold in the country. Am I wrong?"
offmychest,feg2q61,t1_fefz10c,1579074338.0,Gun's only purpose it's to kill. Guns kill more people per year than alcohol. Teenagers are Abel to buy a gun when they still cannot buy alcohol legally. Is there more to say?
