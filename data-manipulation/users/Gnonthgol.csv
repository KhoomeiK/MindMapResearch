explainlikeimfive,fgjajp1,t3_eyu16j,1580840201.0,"The first thing you notice is that it will get harder to find applications which work on your older operating system. Most application developers only test on the latest supported versions and you may find that some applications may not install or have serious defects if you manage to install them. It may be harder to find a version of the application which is supported by your system and this version will not be supported by the vendor. This may not be a huge deal for offline applications but if the application interacts with online services they may break older versions of the applications during an upgrade.

What you likely will not notice much immediately is the security risk. Your operating system and the applications does contain a number of security vulnerabilities. It is just that we do not know about them. As soon as the vendor finds out about the vulnerabilities they fix them and issue a patch to be applied to your system during the next upgrade. However if you are no longer getting any upgrades you still have these security vulnerabilities in your system as they get widely known among criminal networks. And at some point you will be targeted by someone who is exploiting this vulnerability. He can then look through your computer for personal information that he can use to steal your identity or blackmail you, use your computer resources to mine bitcoin, crack password hashes, store child pornography or attack other computers on the Internet or your home, encrypt all your files and ransom you for the decryption key or all of the above."

There is also a type of virus called retrovirus which is able to produce DNA when it infects a host cell. This will effectively add a new genome to the host cell which gets incorperated into the host cell genome. The most famous retrovirus is HIV.

In science fiction there is a concept of combining these techniques. If you can artificially edit a retrovirus to remove the harmfull effects and add beneficial genomes it could be possible to use this to add genomes to almost every cell in a multicelled organism. However we are far from this in real life both technologically and morally."
ItemShop,fgiusv0,t1_fgilisd,1580831379.0,"Barrel length does have an impact on accuracy and velocity, but it is not linear at all. If the barrel is too short the bullet is still accelerating as it exits the barrel and could have had a higher velocity. If the barrel is too long the bullet stops accelerating and is slowed down due to friction. So for a given cartridge there is an optimal barrel length which gives the highest velocity. Velocity also impacts accuracy as higher velocity means shorter flight time and less time for wind to affect the trajectory. Too short barrel also reduces the spin of the bullet as the rifling is too short which also reduces accuracy. However if the barrel is too long you get issues with vibrations and recoil which can also be unpredictive and reduce accuracy. For example the way you hold the gun and position your arms will change the impact of a rifle more then a pistol. But yes, the crown and the ammunition is the most critical components of accuracy."

So it does not have to be a secret, private or democratic election. Each states political party is free to hold the primaries as they want. The concept of a caucus is that you gather together your parties voters in a neighborhood into a caucus and then you discuss who should be president. These discussions means no votes are private and even allows open corruption to happen. In Iowa there is also the old system of voting for deligates that were in place before modern communications. So each caucus will send a number of deligates to the county who will then discuss again to decide which deligates they will send to the state who eventually will decide who they will send to the national congression. This means that it is fully possible to be the most popular candidate by the number of voters but still not get many deligates. What is different this year is that they will publish the results from each stage of the caucus. Iowa does not have much direct influence on the national level but because they are first they will have a big impact on the rest of the primary election campaign. Releasing the results from the initial votes is a better indicator of popularity then the final results. However there were some issues with the numbers so they have not been released yet. It can be technical issues or a deliberate attempt to manipulate the numbers."

Both to help with further checkups to see what to look at and if things have changed and for accounting and liability documentation. Your teeth are quite resilient to a number of things which would destroy other tissue. So in the worst case you may not have much to identify a body on except the dental work. And no, there is no online dental record database for police to search. You would be lucky if the dentist even keeps records for more then a few years. And that is if you can find who was the dentist. In some cases dental records may be collected for a missing person and added to their case file. This may give you something to search for but police investigators are not dentists and does not know how to enter the information into the systems in a consistent way so this search often involves having to go through all the missing persons records manually. But it is not only dental records which is looked at. There is usually other features as well which have been discovered on or near the body which might match something in the case file."

explainlikeimfive,fgfzlfp,t3_eyab9b,1580751043.0,We do not really know as there is very little written about this. What we do know is that the Ancient Greek and Romans used an eight day week which were also divisible by their calendar. So they could use the same calendar every year which made planning of festivals and other events easier. The calendar also followed the lunar cycle. We start finding references to the modern seven day week a few decades before year one. The days were named after the seven known planets at the time who were again named after gods. This is still largely true today. The seven day week became more and more popular over the eight day week. Especially as the calendar were reformed and two extra months were added to complete the year meaning the eight day week did not fit the new calendar. If there ever was a book discussing the change from the eight day week to the seven day week or the reasoning behind the naming of the days after the planets it have been lost to history.

If one ship were caught in a storm it could nearly bankrupt them. So you ask them how often this happens. About one in twenty trips results in the loss of ship and cargo (does not care about the crew). After a bit of thinking you come up with an idea. You offer the ship owners an insurance for a trip to India for 7% of the value of the ship and cargo. The ship owners are extatic as they no longer risk losing most of their money in a bad storm and now have a very predictable cost. You quickly end up insuring 40 ships. Because you know how often ships gets lost you know that about two insured ships will be lost per trip. And even if you write off those two ships you have a fair profit. If three ships gets lost you will get a slight loss overall but by the time you have to pay out there will be more ships who have sailed out and you would have sold more insurance. And if there is only one ship lost you have gained a lot of profits. So the ship owners have predictable income, you have predictable income and everyone is happy."

People have tried to comply with the license requirements by building a separate VMware cluster with a separate SAN on a separate network. However it can easily bite you when the license revision comes around.

You have three viable options. Firstly work with Oracle sales when planning the migration of your Oracle databases to your VMware environment. This does require you to actually buy something from them but if you get a sales person to sign off on your planned implementation to get the sale the license reviewers have to respect that document. If a seller is not willing to sign off find another one as being an Oracle seller is a highly competitive job. Second option is to install an Oracle VM environment to host your database VMs. Try to avoid this if at all possible. Third option is to upgrade your database cluster to make use of technology such as Grid, RAC and Enterprise Manager so that you get all the features of a VM hypervisor like live migration and resource sharing but for databases."

You can get extended DNA tests which will look at even more datapoints but these are expensive. And they still not guarantee that they are able to get it right. With identical twins it is even harder as they have the same DNA. However even identical twins may have some difference in how their genes behave which can be changed by outside factors. These properties will be transferred to the son. So in theory you might see some difference in DNA tests between identical twin brothers but it can be very hard to find or know for certain that it is not just a wrong reading of the tests."

Especially if the water is cold in which case your muscles will get cooled and get even weaker and possibly even trigger cramps making them useless.

So the bombs dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, even though they were primitive, did not produce much nuclear fallout. At least not compared to uncontrolled core meltdowns.

In Fukushima you did have this situation as several of the cores melted due to a loss of cooling and it produced lots of radioactive material. However the design of the reactor vessel have contained these so everything is in a pile of molten slag at the bottom. A problem with this is that the slag is so inaccessible that it is hard to inspect it unlike more modern nuclear reactor designs. So we can not see if there is any leaks anywhere. To find leaks we take samples of the ground water and sea around the nuclear plant and it does show radioactive chemicals which comes from these slag piles. It is still just small amounts and is not detectable unless you sample it right next to the nuclear plant. However it does present a risk of the leak getting worse. So while it is a concern it is not an immediate threat.

The food administration in every country is continuously monitoring both domestic and imported food for both toxins and radioactive substances. Due to the nuclear meltdown at Fukushima there is a heightened awareness of radioactive particles in fish from Japan. And so far they have not seen any issues. The biggest health issue caused by the Fukushima incident is that nuclear power plants are shutting down faster then before without new ones being built in their place which means coal and gas power plants are being built to meet power demands and that in turn increases the pollution in the air causing airway problems for the general population."

Secondly unlike foreign infections the cancer cells are human cells which are just out of control.

So in addition to the normal lines carrying digital sound you would have an I^(2)C bus between the two chips. It takes very little effort for the DAC chip to receive messages on the I^(2)C bus and set internal registers as it is a very simple bus.

An aiplane flies because it creates a high pressure area bellow the wing and a low pressure area above the wing and the difference in airpressure over the area of the wing creates a net force which is greater then the weight of the airplane. A boat however have a hull which goes down into the water where the pressure is greater then at the surface and therefore creating a similar difference in pressure over the hull which creates a net force that is as great as the weight of the boat. Water is much heavier then air so as you go deeper into the water the pressure increases much faster then the air pressure inside the hull.

This means that the car behind them will have to slow down even further until eventually the back of the queue is standing still.

There have been some research into how the queues form and how we might be able to get rid of them. Some motorways have been able to limit the number of cars entering them to prevent the queues and therefore improve throughput. Car manufacturers are also equiping their cars with automatic cruise control which are faster and more accurate then human drivers and can therefore help prevent the queues forming and help dissipate the queues. It have been shown that if all the cars maintain the same distance to the car in front of them as the car behind them it takes a lot more to create queues then if everyone drives like today. Some car manufacturers are even suggesting letting the cruise controls in the cars communicate with each other so that they will be linked to the car in front and therefore the entire motorway acts as one big car. So when the first car gets going all the other cars behind them will start accelerating in unison, and when they brake all the cars will brake in unison. However this requires all cars to have the exact same system."

The reason why brown eyes is so common is because you only need one gene for brown eyes in order to have brown eyes. And you have two of every gene. So in order for your eyes to be gray both your genes for eye color needs to be gray. This was the case with your grandmother. And because you get one gene from each of your parent your mother had at least one gene for gray eyes and the other gene from her dad must be for brown eyes as she had brown eyes. However by random luck you got the gene for gray eyes that came from your grandmother. On your fathers side it could go back even further with a gene for gray eyes getting hidden by genes for brown eyes for several generations before you randomly ended up with it.

Your current latency is casued by two things, both the limit of the speed of light and the processing time of the communications equipment. Whenever a player does an action the information about this event have to go from the players computer to the server and then out to the other players. What you are suggesting is to add another server into the mix here so that the information about the event will go through one server onto the next before going out to the other player. However you are still using the same lines to cover the same distance. In fact you are adding more distance and processing. So it is expected to increase your latency.

As for the question of it being possible there are some technical issues. There are many different tools for syncronizing disks as this is a fairly common practice. You have everything from backup tools to tools intended for live syncronization and everything between. But doing this would not let you access the disk from both locations at the same time and you would have to fail over the application to the other side. This is done in cases where the primary goal is redundancy. Some applications do have built inn syncronization between different intstances and they may even allow you to run both sites at once. But again you have the issue of latency due to the speed of light that you can not escape.

So when going from a circuit to another, for example going from an amplifier circuit to a transmission line, you have to make sure the amplifier circuit have the same impedence as the transmission line.

By counting these signals you can get a speed reading. Similarly you can record the reflected light and either holes in the plate or different paints on the plate will produce the signals. Another possability is to use different magnetic sensors like reed switches or hall effect sensors to detect the changing geometry of some metal. The on board computer will count the signals and convert them to a speed for display. Older cars with manual instruments would have a mechanical system in the guage which pushed the guage a bit up for every revolution of the wheels (either using an electric cable with the signal or using a rotating wire to the instrument panel).

In a video game you are taking existing 3D models and textures in the game and render them in their new position to a new texture which is displayed on the screen. This does require multiple passes but in all of the passes you have a single function passing over each datapoint, be in pixel or 3D vector. This is a workload which graphics cards are designed to do and can do extremely optimally. Rendering a video might involve some of the same processes for example if you are adding some video effects, overlaying text or overlaying another video on top. However the final step in video rendering is usually compressing the video for export. A compressing algorithm is to put it simply trying to find patterns not only within the millions of pixels in a frame but also between different frames and then outputting those patterns which is more space efficient then the original files. Looking for patterns is something which requires lots of data for each step and is not something which can be easily done in parallel in a GPU. It is still faster in a GPU then a CPU but it is a much more demanding workload then video game rendering. Those that work a lot with video compression will try to tweak the options to use different sets of compression algorithms and different levels of pattern recognition to find a sweet spot between rendering time and file size."

Shouting out loud would be a disruption of the public peace and quiet. If security considered him a threat to themselves and the public for example if they were worried he would hit anyone they would be allowed to physically restrain him and escort him out by light force. So everything you proposed that he would do is illegal. Calling the sheriff would not help him out.

However it is a common trope in movies that people cheating at a Las Vegas casino gets taken to a back room and beaten before getting banned from the city. And this is something we do have several trusted accounts of in the real world. The strip in Las Vegas was built by mobsters and still is run by mobsters. They even made sure to build it outside the city limits as it still is today. Among other things this means that all the casinos is outside of the city jurisdiction. The police force with the jurisdiction in the area is the Paradise County Sheriff. And they tend to stay out of the strip unless they want to deal with all the private security staff and retaliation from the mob. All the uniformed cars and men you see patrolling the strip are hired security guards owned and operated by the casinos to keep the peace. If there is some sort of altercation between the security guards and a guest it could be a case that ends up in the court system. However the security guards knows exactly where every camera is and knows what they can do without there being any evidence. They do have the right to escort anyone off their premises for any reason they want. However they will likely testify that the last time they saw you they throw you out into a back alley which happens to be without cameras. You did seam very upset, angry, drunk and possibly high on drugs. And they do have evidence of this as there is camera footage of them escorting you off the floor towards the back alley and then the same guards emerge back onto the casino floor just seconds later."

For example the flavoring, coloring and artificial sweeteners usually contain as much neutrition as fat. However because they use so little of those ingredients the final product contain very little calories. And depending on legislation they can therefore be allowed to round the amount of calories down to zero on the neutrition label. One of the worst legislation for this is in the US where the law can be interpreted as allowing anything under 5g of sugar per serving to be rounded down to zero. This does mean that a 4g sugar cube can be marketed as zero calory sugar. You might therefore market an entire packet of sugar cubes as zero calory even though it have just as many calories as normal packets of sugar cubes. However for energy drinks and other soft drinks it is usually enough to replace the sugar with artificial flavoring to come well under the minimum calorie count to market it as zero calories."

This often means they have to disconnect the axle from the gearbox, often by disconnecting the drive shaft. Otherwise some gearboxes does have the hidden neutral disconnect function, either accessible from under the car or hidden next to the gear selector inside the car. If you engage this it is safe to tow the car. But yes, different situations requires different techniques to safely tow the car. And sometimes the best way is to drag the car out tyres screaming so you can connect to it properly."
AnimalsBeingDerps,fff9pm2,t3_et9fy1,1579879158.0,"We had a loft that was accessible through a spring loaded hatch and ladder. The loft was uninsulated and mice sometimes took refuge there. One time we left the hatch and ladder open and unattended for a few minutes before we closed it up again. After an hour we would hear faint cat cries but had a hard time locating it. Then abount ten minutes later we heard the sound of a cat hitting the floor from height and the sound of the loft hatch closing by its springs. The cat was frightened but unharmed. The next time we opened the loft hatch, probably a few months later, the cat came running and ran up the ladder and sat in the loft waiting for us to close it up again. He was probably going to hunt for mice and now that he knew that he only had to stand on the hatch to get it to open he was not frightened of getting locked up again. Sure enough after a couple of hours alone in the loft he jumped down again quite satisfied with himself."

However this power is mostly theoretical as anything but following the recomendations from the politicians elected by the people would most likely be seen as abuse of power which could overthrow the monarchy. However there is a few situations when monarchs have used their powers in order to stabelize the country. Such situations have been attempted coups, invasions, politicians failing to settle on a government or governments clearly not following the will of the people. The country is also benefiting diplomatically as having a royal family to attend different events is better and easier then sending busy politicians."
