pharmacology,fffsyh4,t1_fffnckz,1579891119.0,"Could alcohol acutely alleviate some of the symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal due to its effects on the GABAA receptor? I don't see why not.

That doesn't mean it would be suitable as drug substitution treatment. First of all, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are preferred for alcohol detox because they are long-acting benzodiazepines and therefore better suited for managing withdrawal, whereas alcohol has a shorter duration of action. Secondly, [one of the patterns of benzodiazepine withdrawal is persistent rebound anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7841856). Since you are going to have to taper off alcohol, aren't you just doing something similar to what we already do to manage benzodiazepine withdrawal, which is to gradually reduce their dose? Thirdly, [benzodiazepine-dependent patients would be at greater risk of developing alcohol dependence](https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00008877-200411000-00006)."

You realize of course that the idea that everyone deserves equal representation has been an intensely contested political question. Not only have centuries of civil rights struggle and even wars been fought over it, there is still a massive question mark over whether everyone is represented equally under the current system in the US (and that's putting it lightly), not to mention other political systems around the world. 

Politics not being adversarial requires for one part of the population to not gatekeep another part of the population from having an equal voice on decision-making, and until we reach that point, suggesting that there are no battles to be won just reinforces the status quo, and thus the will of the powerful over that of the oppressed."
