synthesizers,ffe4qcj,t3_esvkpd,1579836651.0,"VCO's
You need a VCO (voltage-controlled oscillator) to make noise. That's the start of any signal path. If for whatever reason you're on stage and suddenly no noise comes out you might want to first check that at least one VCO is on. Some synths come with four or five that you can layer. An analog VCO is based off simple shapes like sine, saw, square. A digital one allows for more precise noise, so they have wavetables so you can make much more complicated stuff. 

FILTERS (also called VCFs - voltage controlled filters)
Filters are fun to twist to open/close while playing notes. An example is a high pass filter which will allow the high frequencies to go through, while lowering the low frequencies. A low pass is the opposite."

If human mutilations aren't real I'm totally good with that because I would imagine aliens would have a similar amount of compassion when studying us.

fantasywriters,fepj3y7,t3_eq9hek,1579321813.0,"What if the son goes to avenge the murdered father, (but along the way he gets subtle clues during a series of sentimental flashbacks or something that his father was actually leading a double life) you finally confront the killer, and and there is a huge twist where it turns out the killer only murdered the father because he was actually evil and about to detonate a bomb within their city, but the bomb is only minutes away from detonating itself because of a dead Man's switch then the protag works with the MC through the clues you laid along the way and turns out the key to disarming the bomb is in a very sentimental place the whole time. 

I dunno - something like that might not be what you've got in mind but you kind of have to twist everything back on itself so people go ""oh snap! that thing turned out to be super important!"""
