iamatotalpieceofshit,fgj2noe,t3_eyplwk,1580835824.0,"My neighbor had a dog that would never stop barking. It was loud as hell too, with at least twice the volume output of their other dog. They would leave this dog outside to lose his mind for 20-60 minutes at a time multiple times a day. Finally I'd had enough of it and decided I needed to take matters into my own hands. So I wrote them a letter to please be mindful of how loud their dog is and how much he barks/the times of morning/night that he's allowed to bark freely. The situation immediately improved. I still hear the dog all the time, but it's no longer acting as my un-programmable alarm clock, and I'm not forced to listen said alarm clock going off for an hour at a time 6 times a day. Maybe it would have been better to go speak to my neighbor in person about it, but I get really anxious about confrontation, and thankfully it worked out in the end. 

Either way the idea of killing the dog never crossed my mind. I figured I should contact them first and ask that they be more mindful of the barking. If that failed I might have tried asking again, then going to cops about noise ordinances. Dogs bark, it's what they do, and it isn't really their fault if they don't know any better. There's plenty of more reasonable actions to take if that barking is bothering you that much, and you'd have to be a sick son of a bitch to do what this guy did."

todayilearned,fgh9po4,t1_fgh6avx,1580779954.0,"So many people died in World War 2, in so many different places, that the real number won't ever be known. Best estimates are 50-80 million deaths, as many as 100 from some historical scholars. With that in mind, think about how difficult it would be to accurately account for every death in the holocaust. What we're left with are historians doing their best to piece back what happened from all of the remaining available evidence. Since the Nazis notoriously burned a great deal of the records they made of their crimes when it was clear to them that they would lose the war, it means that the available evidence is limited to what remained unburned, and the perpetrators and surviving victims who were willing to speak about what they saw. 

So the actual estimates will fluctuate from scholar to scholar, but  you won't find them denying that the scale of the holocaust was immense, even if they can't reach a consensus on the actual number. That's how history works a lot of the time."

So if it is Daniel Radcliffe, he might just hand those cards out to people who say he looks like Daniel Radcliffe, and then walk away leaving people wondering if that was actually him or not.

And despite part of the current political climate being far more tolerant of offensive speech (particularly from one individual), I think the general rule still applies in politics.

I always feel for the ANZAC troops at Gallipoli. A government half the world away shipped them off to fight on foreign soil for questionable gain under extremely poor leadership. I just can't imagine being killed or maimed in such a pointless and hopeless war perpetrated by politicians/generals for personal glory. I'd argue that the way the First World War was resolved is one of the primary factors that played into causing the second, as well, so the suffering of WWI was such that it perpetrated itself onto a whole new generation of kids, led by the fighters of the first.
