The kids may not have done anything wrong but there are also homeless people on the street. So does your obligation extend towards every random stranger?

I am all for appealing to OP to be more big hearted and make sure the kids don't suffer, especially since OP and his family is already well placed.

Even if I buy the ""nature"" argument that some people are naturally gifted, they will still only have an edge with respect to 2-3 of the sub-skills. And you, someone perhaps not as gifted, will also have an edge on other micro skills.

So at the end of the day, it is about passion, commitment, time spent, obsessiveness at acquiring the expertise. The people who you think are gifted? They must have put in the time. Or their parents worked with them a lot more intensively during the early years to give them that head start.

Truth is that all these are abstract subjects and abstract concepts. And our brain really really struggles to assimilate and understand abstract concepts. One way to do it is to use real-world analogies. However, many times, there will be no good analogy. Which is why calculus for example, or automata, or complex math becomes so hard to understand ""it hurts the brain"".

The only way out of it is to persevere. Immerse yourself. You're retraining your brain, rewiring it in different ways. But for that, you have to immerse yourself in the subject, and sleep on tough abstract problems. And often, there will be a big AHA or Eureka kind of moment when things will click in place.

Think about it. We trivialize the difficulty of other things as well. How hard is it to play a musical instrument well? It takes hundreds of hours of practice to even get the basics right or learn to use the left hand separately from the right hand. That is also an example of rewiring our brain.

EatCheapAndHealthy,fgi126u,t3_eyg874,1580800759.0,"Rice is a staple in may parts of India. The go-to-method to make rice tasty is to add melted ghee or clarified butter to rice. Kids absolutely love it.

And you can make cliarified butter easy peasy. Just take a pound of unsalted butter and heat it in a saucepan on medium heat. It will melt and after about 20 minutes, will start foaming up. Keep stirring it every 5 minutes or so. Just make sure you're not on high heat. Low or medium is good.

After about 45 minutes or so, the butter will stop foaming and suddenly, the butter will clear up and you will start seeing the bottom. That's when the milk solids separate from the milk fat (ghee or clarified butter) and the milk solids will settle to the bottom.

Pour the clear milkfat into a jar. It can be stored in room temp for months. It is great as a finishing oil or for deep frying (works just like lard) or for adding to rice and giving it a delicious flavor.

Don't throw away the milk solids. They have a nutty buttery tanginess and go great with rice or tortillas or bread too as a spread.

So yeah, you want kids to eat rice? Add a big dollop of ghee or clarified butter to the rice and they will love the buttery rice goodness."

I mean, I don't pretend to speak for any ""people"". But I can only speak for myself and my own viewpoint. 

Two aspects: First: the blunt truth: Tons of people who grow up in highly regressive cultures where sex is a huge taboo tend to have a fling or multiple flings before they succumb to society's dictats about morality and marriage and that sort of thing. You really think you or your future husband or even your other girlfriends have never ever had a girlfriend or boyfriend? Never had sex? Like, really?? Even in the most regressive subcontinent countries, it is rampant. Much less America. In fact, the irony is that ABCDs are way more coy and afraid than most people in Pakistan and India and Bangladesh. Because we live in a more controlled bubble. 

Second: Everyone needs to think deeply about the basic concepts of shame, such as ""tarnishing"" and ""saving"". I am not saying it one way or another. But it is a bit silly and downright sexist if you think that guys have a HUGE leeway in trying to get girls but girls need to ""protect"" themselves and ""save"" themselves. That is a logical impossibility, over a period of time.  

The truth is that immigrants live in a bubble. Even in the subcontinent, progress and economy is rising so quickly that people are looking at other people who can contribute towards family income. Life has become pragmatic and money driven. Gone are the days when it was all about girls being the burden and guys being the money makers. It is actually the immigrants who still live in this bubble and still stick to traditional notions. Everywhere else, it is very very practical - it is all about money and success and what every member of the family brings to the table."

And many of these startups do fairly bottom-barrel service industry stuff like supplying security guards to companies or delivering food or supplying cleaning staff to companies.

A lot of the stereotypes have vanished as people have rapidly realized that there is real money to be made in many of the non-white collar professions too.

I am increasingly seeing that the Indian desis who emigrated to the US and other countries a few decades ago still live in that socialist bubble of India that existed 30 years ago when they emigrated. Desi parents tend to be way more orthodox, religious, narrow minded, conservative, and shallow thinking than most everyone in India today.

Anyway, congratulations on forging your own path! Certifications in your field is very important, especially since the aviation industry is very highly regulated. 

My two cents would be to see if you can also get certified and trained/hands-on on commercial aircrafts like 737, A320, or widebody jets like 777. That will give you tons of options to keep you future-proofed and also give you employment options."

  Yogurt making is a big tradition in India as yogurt is a main source of protein for many. It is not an either/or. You start with making yogurt. Then over time, yogurt or diluted yogurt naturally becomes sour (ferments).

In some Indian recipes, you would add salt, cut green chilies, cilantro, roasted cumin powder, and ginger to the sour yogurt and that would be a very effective summer drink to beat and heat and replenish electrolytes. Not sure if this is in the same ballpark as kefir though."
