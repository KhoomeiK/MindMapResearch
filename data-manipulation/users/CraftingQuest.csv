And heroin. My parents have to use their wifi though their phones because they live a few miles outside of their town and can't get internet. They also still use a well for water, as it would be outrageous to have city water put in. The US also has so many more homeless people. It's insane how so many people have to live. People will lose their homes because someone gets cancer. You can go into work one day and be fired for no reason at all at lose everything.
