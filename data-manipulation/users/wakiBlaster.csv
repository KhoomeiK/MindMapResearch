While I have nothing against partners watching porn in a relationship, this is to the point of him choosing a false reality over you. Stay strong OP"
depression,fej6opq,t3_ep842q,1579159124.0,"Hey man, about the friends part I can’t really help as I’m struggling with the same thing myself and there’s others in the comments that gave stellar advice. However about you not feeling “good at anything” this is because of what our society is feeding to us. In reality, most people are just average at everything. If everyone was good then that would defeat the meaning behind going above and beyond others. However we’re often fed that “you’re special and good at everything”. To remedy this, come to terms with the fact that we’re all average, BUT we can make ourselves better over time through work, research, self development ect. I’d start with honing in on whatever interests you. Take what you already like and build off it. Chin up man you got this. Cheers"
