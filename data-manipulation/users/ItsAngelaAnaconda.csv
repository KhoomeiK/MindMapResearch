Teachers,fehb53a,t3_eovud5,1579112925.0,"I teach kindergarten and they are absolutely hysterical! I laugh all day every day. Sometimes at things I shouldn't laugh at. Like yesterday at circle time, one of my kids stood up and started crying, saying they'd had an accident. The kid who was sitting beside her looks at the puddle on the carpet, throws her arms up, rolls her eyes, and goes ""Oh for fucks sake Ava!!"" Definitely hard not to laugh at that."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fedm8zk,t1_fedjnau,1579014981.0,What are you talking about? Lots of houses in Canada don't have basements. We had to weed them out when we were house hunting.
aww,fct55va,t3_eiqylg,1577933148.0,This makes me really want to be a cat. That just looks so relaxing and cozy.
aww,fcr4qw6,t1_fcqqsmw,1577896763.0,"I'm a huge proponent of 'adopt, don't shop' but adoption is basically never free. And there's nothing here that states this isn't a rescue dog. Travelling doesn't mean the puppy isn't from a shelter. My local shelter rarely ever has dogs, so we'd have to travel a fair distance to adopt one."
tifu,fcgrfxm,t3_eh81ww,1577643298.0,"Omg this reminds me of when I was younger and my family had moved into a new house. We didn't know our neighbours very well, but knew they had a dog named Steve and the husband's name was Chris. Somehow my whole family got this mixed up and we referred to the dog as Chris and the husband as Steve for months. My mom would call over the fence ""hi Chris, aren't you just so cute!?"" We were all mortified when we realized."
aww,fc46hhu,t3_eg0r7h,1577407919.0,Didn't scroll far enough to see the dog at first. Thought it was weird that a full grown man was up for adoption.
aww,fc4531h,t3_eg2xp8,1577406852.0,"What am I missing? I don't see anything ""aww"" worthy."
insanepeoplefacebook,fc42xcu,t1_fc3yqjm,1577405231.0,"Look next to it. She's pretending to be vegan because it's trendy, but eats KFC."
aww,fc3hiog,t1_fc2nkpe,1577389922.0,"This kid is definitely not as old as people are saying. I'd say she's about 2. Either way, your niece definitely won't be near this at 6mos, but she'll probably have a little personality coming out. I personally love that age! You'll have a lot of fun with her"
AskReddit,fbzijdr,t1_fbwo6pn,1577247859.0,I'm right there with you cause I also thought that and totally thought I'd solved my problem
