At 176k miles, I'd be asking about timing belt and water pump, steering components, CV joints, wheel bearings, rotors and brakes. Make sure oil isnt leaking from anywhere, coolant isnt leaking, belts are in good condition, exhaust manifold is in good shape. If it's a standard, I'd ask about when the clutch was replaced last as well. Where you are, I'd be looking at the AC as well, but that's a lot of hope for a 20 year old car. 

Honestly, your best bet is bring it to a trusted mechanic regardless of the answers and let them take a once over and give you their opinion. Especially so after an accident. You could easily put another 100k on that vehicle, or you could be spending 3x more than you paid for it in repairs to just get it inspected.

The mom is a weird one. She wasnt much in our lives. I was 30, got the phone call she was on life support and what to do next. I flew down with my brother to take her off life support. When we arrived we were told she was in a deep coma, but to go ahead and talk to her. The second she heard my voice, I saw tears. I still cant yell you if they were tears of happiness, sorrow, regret. I try not to think about it. 12 hours later we took her off the machines, and she had tears again, as if she knew this was it.

Her boyfriend had an incredibly hard time through this, and it's something I have really thought about until writing this now. He dodnt want her off the machines, thinking she'd come around. To him, the tears and involuntary movements meant something. Unfortunately she was in total liver failure from untreated hepatitis and a lifetime of drug use. She wasnt strong enough for a transplant, not that she would have gotten one anyway.

$2.10 in 1975 in todays money!? 10.17.
