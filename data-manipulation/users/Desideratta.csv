They act like a collar and leah on a dog. They are (usually) leather. They are for controlling the bird, to prevent them from leaving the wrist if startled or spot prey. They are designed so that if the bird ever got away from the handler, they would be able to remove them on their own. They are only used during handling - unlike a dogs collar or a horse’s halter, they are not left on the bird. 

Aluminum bands are permanently attached to the birds tarsus (legbone above the “knee” joint) with a unique ID number. This is in case the bird is lost, found dead, or used in a research study. There is an insane database of banded birds that is used internationally and it is strictly regulated."

Why even reveal his actual name at all, if his reputation is all that matters?

As a character, he's not that important so far, so what's his actual role in the story? Kvothe could have easily told his story to just Bast. Or through actually finishing his memoirs. I believe Chronicler has some role to play outside of just being a nerdy twat in a tavern with a neato transcription method."

AskReddit,fepvybu,t3_eqcui9,1579333259.0,"This is actually a real brain chemistry thing for people who are depressed, anxious, or related challenges. 

A “normal”, healthy brain gets fatigued when sleep deprived. Emotional and cognitive responses are subdued, delayed, or non present. It wants sleep when night rolls around. 

In a person with imbalances like depression or anxiety, more neurotransmitter receptors open up or become available than usual when CHRONICALLY deprived of sleep. Thus you get more ‘reward’ for everything good  - from flavour profiles (late night binge eating), to sex, or to substances (caffeine, alcohol, drugs) etc. 

But if you can get your brain to a healthy state, this reward system is much more effective because it it more flexible, and occurs in a ‘normal pattern’ ie, daytime. It also has a lingering effect.

I spent a week on concept and sent a couple designs in a digital draft. 

They approved their favourite with some changes, and sent me a revised copy that was done in MS paint (I’m assuming). They also requested a custom made typeface just for them.  It went back and forth at least 3 times. We met again as a group to discuss the final draft and colours. 

I spent a LOT of time on this already. Finally Made the album cover with all the revisions included. I sent them the end product and final invoice. 

They bailed. They decided to have a minimalist cover instead. Just a faded blue background and their album/band name in papyrus typeface. *Papyrus!*

They paid for my drink in the first session and not a penny after.

She is so sad and upset and her parents wouldn’t take her to the hospital. I was devastated and asked for details. Healthy kids don’t just die - right? Then I realized. 

SHE HAD GOTTEN HER PERIOD.  She told her mom she’d been bleeding *down there*. Her mom got her a box of pads and told her to read the instructions. NO OTHER EXPLANATION. She had bled for days. Naturally this seemed to her like something that lead to inevitable death. 

I decide I was unequipped to explain things to her - I’d had like, 2or 3 periods’ experiences at that time. I took her home and asked my mom to help explain. Poor girl. I’m so glad my mom was mature enough to have at least covered the basics with me, and this hapless neighbour of mine.

PCOS,fe5y82n,t1_fe5mhfz,1578877595.0,I do the same! One in the car console. One in my purse. One in my desk.
PCOS,fe5y34d,t3_envby5,1578877511.0,"Tweeze the darkest and coarsest hairs whenever they are long enough to grab. Usually once a week or so I do this. Every day I use a very mild unscented shaving cream by Public Goods and public goods razor. Shave opposite of hair growth for smoothest result, or with the hair growth if your facial hair is really dense and you get skin irritation easily. 

When I’m done with the razor, I rinse it in alcohol which prolongs the life of the blade and prevents irritation and breakouts by killing bacteria. Use a soothing moisturizer, witch hazel, or aloe on your face after shaving to prevent redness before applying makeup."
AskReddit,fe0ljee,t3_eng8y5,1578815592.0,"Ask for consent. Talk about protection ahead of time. Make sure your partner is having a good time too. Educate yourself on anatomy and expectations (no, porn is not an educational source). 

Have fun. Be safe. Be kind. 

Also.... be aware some people have weird reactions to emotional or physical stress. They (or you!) may laugh, or cry, or shake, or have any number of other reactions after sex. It doesn’t mean they didn’t enjoy it or that they loved it. Sometimes your body reacts oddly. It’s ok."
hensinsync,fdzg3mi,t1_fdzc74r,1578789920.0,Thanks man. I hate stealing others stuff to cross post; but it just fit too well here. I admit I came up with “cirque de Poulet” a long time ago - maybe last spring -  when I took a video of my partner doing this exact thing with our hens in our garden and posted it to FB. It was too good not to use again.
