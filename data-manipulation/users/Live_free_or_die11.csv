I mean like, i feel like people who would be the best parents are those who will feel the pain of others, moreso. I feel like people who dont mind having alot of abortions are probably not going to be as good parents as those who choose not to get abortions, specifically for the reason that they dont want to hurt the child. 

Money isnt nearly as important. Most of the best people grow up fairly poor anyways. A mothers love for that child and whats shes willing to do to make that kid comfortable and happy is whats going to define the character of that child. It is ones character not race, or gender. The difference between race genetically is very small. The difference between a person having a high selection for compassion and intelligence is far mote important. A cultures ability to foster that path is much more important too.

Some people are more or less affected by it. I just remembered after I played with my kid in her mothers womb, I realized that she was thinking, and she liked me. She knew I was her father. Humans, or animals in general are something far more amazing then people realize. An animal is the only thing that can bring you love. The thing that can bring order in a chaotic universe. The purpose of life in some ways. To create an enviroment for your child that you love with all of your heart.

It was quite amazing to me how my personality changed after I had a kid. I amaze myself with what I can accomplish because I want to give them a good life.

Kind of like a function in programming. You don't have to understand every detail to understand things. Instead of thinking about every single blood cell in your body, you can create an abstracted object to repersent that blood cell, and use it to think about every blood cell from a high level.

You can attach labels to things, see hidden ethereal relationships, and infer things about the other things.

I think the mind is much more capable then a computer because it can use all kinds of tricks and shortcuts to handle extreamly complex problems, and massive amounts of data, on just a few watts of energy.

The thing about having an armed populace is basically this. They can do alot of shit and get away with it, but when it comes down to it. The people can always rise up. The people can always retaliate with force if they are abused to the point where they are willing to give up their life for a principle. Atleast the government has to pretend like it cares about freedom, atleast a tyrant like the virginia governor gets to look out his windows and behind his barbwire and mercenaries, tens of thousands sit there with their weapons to send a clear message to them.

They buried huge child sex rings and turned a blind eye as they killed him in prison so he cant testify.

If people rose up against the government. Due to thermal imaging and other tech like that. The vast majority of it is going to be bombings and hunting rifles. American militias arent going to out fight the police, not unless all of them rise up together. The police assault elements are far better trained, and they will just be hunted down by robots. It would be a while before people started rising up in significant numbers. Depends on how the government reacts to the situation. Ambushes and assassinations would be far more effective. The entire federal government would be wiped out quickly and a less tyrannical government would take its place, ending the fighting, and breaking up the blackmail networks that is used to control politicians who want to take our rights.

As far as the other weapons. You can pretty much own them now, but they are so expensive and require specialized equipment to use that no one is actually going to buy one. They don't have much use in a civil war anyways.

In the event of a civil war, the Military would likely stay neutral, if they didn't straight up join the people outright. Even if they are evil like some people think. The objectives of a resistence wouldnt be to fight the military straight up. The American militias aren't going to be getting in dog fight and navel wars. They are going to blend in the population and set up ambushes on their enemy.  They are going to use homemade bombs to kill the leaders. They are going to turn the rest of the population against the government. The economy would collapse and then moral in the military would. Also people in the military ardnt going to murder American civillians long without having mental breakdowns. (Normally fascist and communist states bring outside armies in, to supress their own people.)

An actual American civil war would likely start like this.

People start increasingly protesting the nullification of the constitution. The government tries to take guns in a state, tens of thousands protest, something happens and shooting starts, everybody starts freaking out and shooting. The police are massacured in a matter of moments as the protestors overrun their state capital. They drag the govoner and his family out and execute all of them in the street. The FBI tries to find the leaders who did it and kill them but before they can send their threats publically more protests start to form as people feel invigorated.

The government starts labeling them as terrorists and stuff, and the media is trying hard to make them look evil, planting fake nazis and filming them. Propaganda goes to 11. The people get mad that the media is being so dishonest. Hundreds of thousands of more people start protesting. People start quitting their jobs, citizens start preparing for a civil war.

A couple of months go by and everything seems to be calming down, however the government starts usimgt he military to police the streets in some cities. This infuriates the people as it is completly illegal and unethical, more people start protesting. The protestors now outnumber the entire military by over 10 million. The U.S military starts mobilizing its reserves, but someone bombs the white house. Without any clear leadership, and growing support form people in the military for the prohuman rights crowd, starts siding with the protestors more. The military refuses to fight and starts withdrawing its troops. The government is furious and tries to change leadership but it repeatedly collapses as most people in the military do not want to fight its own people. The people who own the federal government, corporations and banks, start trying to economically isolate the U.S. The U.S falls into an economic recession. The federal government starts hiring mercenaries and gang members to try and bolster their numbers. At the same time thousands are defecting from the government per week, and eventually what is left of the epistein(deepstate) leadership is killed in bombings, sniper attacks, ambushes, or they escape. The military steps in an provides security to have elections again. The people demand investigations into the hidden elite. Hundreds of people go to jail for bribery, blackmail, or just corruption in general. The U.S enters a golden age of scientific progress and the U.S along with nations around the entire world start building an orbitible ring and space elevators.

It won't cure depression if you fall back I to the same patterns and choices that vot you there. The greatest thing probably is that it just shows you that you exist outside of depression and it shows you that you dont have to be a slave to your mind and thoughts. You can make a concious effort to try and escape it, and you can try and find meaning in your life that will motivate you to escape your old habbits. You can literally change your mind at anytime and become a different person. You dont have to be a label or a class. You as a sentient human being are free to choose who you want to be. I dont mean to downplay it, not at all, but maybe what I say can help you on that path a bit more.

Its also perfectly fine to not want to do them if you dont like them. You might change your mind one day and have a different experience."

You will trip hard for a couple of hours but its not like super crazy. I have eaten 40 mushrooms at once, I have done many different doses, but a small dose is always the best. You don't really trip much harder on higher doses your brain just kimda shuts down. 3 to 4 g is plenty enough for a very intense trip but not so much that it overloads you. When you get comfortable in the tripping mindset you can try higher doses of 6 g or more but your results will very dramatically."
