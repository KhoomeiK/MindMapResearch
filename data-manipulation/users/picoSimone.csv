Ironic, the one thing that got this recluse caught was his need to be heard by his fellow man.  His Brother recognized parts of the released manifesto and tipped off the feds."

Reminds me of a based on a true story movie, ‘Young Poisoner’s Handbook.’  In that particular case, they did not give that guy life and when he got out, he rejoined society and then promptly went about poisoning his work colleagues.  Heavy metal elements was his preferred choice as well.  As the article states, it is tasteless."
