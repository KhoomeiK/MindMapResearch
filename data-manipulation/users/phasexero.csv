 I hated everything about it. The rushed breakfast, the taste of her hair spray lingering in the air, the frantic rush to get everyone in the car, the stressed out dogs we left at home, the overpowering smell/taste of their cologne and perfume in the car and then in the building, all the cakey makeup these plastic looking people wore, the over polite smiles, the standing and sitting and standing and sitting, the horrible horrible singing, everyone acting like the speaker on stage was their personal friend, the decompression in the reminder of the day which was ironically often filled with the blood sport of American foot ball...

After I stood my ground not to walk though the churches threshold, my step mom said I still had to come and that I couldn't wait in the car. So I would sit outside of the church in a place where the rest of the church goes could see me, forced to sit alone in the cold... She eventually agreed to let me just stay at the house. I wonder if that was because she realised I was a human and could make my own decision regarding my religion, or, if she was just embarrassed. Hmm..."

stopdrinking,feji1am,t1_feje98m,1579175164.0,FYI too most podcast platforms have a sleep/auto off timer setting too. Helps you not be 30 episodes ahead by morning
stopdrinking,fejhx3b,t3_ephexd,1579175020.0,"Having a set ""get in bed time"" helps, like an hour before you actually need to be asleep. Do your pre-sleep routine, then get in bed knowing it's ok if it takes a while before you sleep. 

Turning on a dim light and reading a book is a really good way to drift into sleep. I also like to play certain relatively boring/repetitive phone games too, despite the fact that that's on a blue-light screen. No tv, no reddit, no news, no social media.

The hours before bedtime are important too. Drinking caffeine in the afternoon should be a no-go until you've got a good track of easy sleeps. If you work out, it should be earlier in the day too.

My ""break glass in case of emergency"" is Benadryl, which I will take a half tab of 30 mins before I need to sleep. But it can have negative long term impacts of used a lot.

Oh and make sure your bed is comfortable, your room is cool in temperate, and you have a few pillows that you can put between/under your legs or hug if you're a side sleeper. I will never go back to just a head pillow, such a big difference.

Hopefully some of this helps! Sleep is super important to me so I've worked out these things over the past decade and now it's paying off. I had a similar crutch as you for a long time, and now bed has become welcome and refreshing without it.

Oh, a fan for a light breeze and white noise might help you too.
