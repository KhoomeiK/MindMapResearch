'Back home' it is normal to sleep in the living room WITH other people. So, he is placing a higher priority on the room aspect than the idea of sleeping alone. He chose that, not you. 

Either one of those would be 'more like back home'. Why is he choosing the room instead of the company for comfort?"
tifu,fff52o5,t3_et82r9,1579875904.0,"I lean back and let gravity carry me all the way down, like falling or 'tumbling'. It is so fun, like just wave your feet over the steps instead of trying to engage the rest of your body and stopping at each step.

The motion is like riverdancing downward and sideways, if that makes sense."
TaylorSwift,fff3kxk,t1_ffeith3,1579874778.0,"Oh my god, if there was a whiff of suggesting her weight wasn't healthy people would come at you like sharks defending it. Yes, some people have very thin frames and should not be criticized for their appearance. No, Taylor was not one of them. I'm so glad this is on record now so that era is not a standard that young healthy women try to hold themselves to."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,ffarvs6,t3_esjml1,1579743045.0,"What an awful experience, I'm so sorry that happened to you. It doesn't have to meet anyone's else's definition of anything for it to be a shitty thing to have done to you.

> I didn’t say no but I feel like I shouldn’t have done it. 

The phrasing of this bothers me because, from your description, it does not sound like you did anything or that you were in any condition to consent to having things done to you. Any normal person should have recognized that.

I know it will be hard to untangle this on your own right now, regardless. I think you need to cut contact with him after stating why and seek therapy.

I hope this experience doesn't eclipse your grieving completely and that you still have space in your head and your heart to mourn your dad. You deserve that, and I'm so sorry for your loss. 

Big hugs from an internet stranger."

It was a very chill, un-'walmart' moment that still makes me smile."

I'm not going to die because someone made a mistake and took a shot on the wrong day, wrong field, wrong direction.

I hope I don't get hit by a car crossing the street on a bike but I still wear a bike helmet. I don't wear all black when I go walking at night.

They can be wrong all day and I'd still be dead.
