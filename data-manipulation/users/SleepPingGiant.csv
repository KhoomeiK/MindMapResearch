worldnews,ffjrjay,t1_ffjcvft,1580005042.0,I'm still not 100% sure we aren't being punk'd when I hear about shit like this. Like when Trump leaves office is Ashton Kutcher gonna come out and announce he's been fucking with us for like 5 years and once Trump got elected he just kept it going?

worldnews,ff941wg,t1_ff92qs7,1579704334.0,It is encrypted end to end but there have been a couple instances of them being hacked. I'm also not sure how the encryption compares to Telegram as far as how the data is passed along. I know telegram does a fucking outstanding job though.
airsoft,ff92qaq,t1_ff82m2z,1579703399.0,I totally agree that it sucks they are for show but the mechanism that loads the 40mm shells and then ejects them is fairly complex and requires a fair bit of work to actuate the system.
worldnews,ff91mmb,t1_ff83hqc,1579702589.0,I'm more surprised these people are using Whatsapp. Why not use telegram or something that actually has some security.

We can only truly believe in what we have proof of. Sure it's possible Natives walked from coast to coast, but it's incredibly unlikely as it would have not been necessary, helpful, or safe.

It's part of the magic, like how can you call yourself a fan and shit all over everything but say the original trilogy was the greatest. I love the original trilogy, but it sucked. Like a lot.
