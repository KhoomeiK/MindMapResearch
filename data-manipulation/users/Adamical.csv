Check out Ion Maiden too."
gamingsuggestions,ff7h86d,t3_es2y3g,1579649490.0,Dusk? Or too modern?
gamingsuggestions,ff2rjek,t3_er7b4o,1579520926.0,"I've wanted a good modern shooter for a while but they're all battle royales or riddled with bullshit/mtx these days.

I really wanted to like Siege but it's just another hero shooter in disguise.

I wish someone would make a similar game to Siege, attack and defend on small maps, but with a reliance on only strategy and gunplay over goofy scifi abilities. One day maybe."
AnthemTheGame,ff2q6mc,t1_ff2oxu7,1579518957.0,Where did they confirm this? Do you have a link?
horror,ff2mbp6,t3_er5ukg,1579513038.0,Let's hope it's better than the book. Big anti - climax that was.
gamingsuggestions,fezsc4f,t1_fey755d,1579461022.0,How come you wish you were still playing? I'm tempted to take a look but on the edge.

It's not wrong per se, more like incorrectly extended. :D"
spaceengineers,fel5lrg,t1_fekyreh,1579214555.0,Afraid not. From the official website only.
HungryArtists,fef03yh,t3_eopls5,1579045052.0,"Damn dude, I hope you're working professionally too. This is all superb."
gamingsuggestions,fed2ssz,t3_eogi89,1578995923.0,Darksiders Genesis might be a good bridge for her. Not too hardcore but got some good action and puzzling.
educationalgifs,fe2kmt5,t1_fe2iqyb,1578839566.0,Well I can't argue with that.
educationalgifs,fe22v4l,t1_fe209l1,1578833887.0,"I think that's a broad generalisation. Some pockets of society think that but not all. I get your point though. As a whole, youth is considered beautiful.

Jane Seymour still fine as hell though. ;D"

educationalgifs,fe19le4,t3_enk316,1578824070.0,It's all very impressive from a technical perspective but it makes me sad that people struggle with getting old.
pcgaming,fdpwyla,t1_fdl8ddq,1578643993.0,Because it's fantastic!
pcgaming,fdpwsmz,t1_fdkooj9,1578643783.0,"Ditto. I've bounced off Destiny 2 three times now. Just don't find it fun, nor do I like the style and world.

Warframe used to be my number one but the grind has become ridiculous so I've dropped that too. :("
Warframe,fdf6bj1,t3_el138r,1578354307.0,How resource intensive is a wallpaper like that? Does it automatically stop when you load a game or something?
BrandNewSentence,fcuoiyi,t3_eixy3p,1577985351.0,I don't think you would.
Warframe,fctt6wn,t1_fctstco,1577958236.0,And that attitude is why I haven't played in a few months. :(
Warframe,fcpz2cg,t1_fcpmhz6,1577875233.0,"This is the correct attitude for me. Don't give us a way to avoid annoying content, just make more enjoyable content. Lichs are a huge disappointment tbh."
