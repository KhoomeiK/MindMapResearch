My job didn’t exist in the 1950s.  But I sure as shit make more than my parents ever did.  It’s the fact that the barrier to the “dream” is now higher than before.

Nothing changes because not enough people care enough.    You’ll make circle jerk statements and then go back to living your pathetic life inside a video game. 

But you all know Trump wins in a landslide because all people care about is the economy and most Americans don’t give a flying fuck about the loser class.
