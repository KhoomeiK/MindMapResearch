pmp,ffet824,t3_et4ub4,1579864415.0,Congratulations!  Good news though- nobody asks tartlets.  Just pass/fail.  So only care for your own sense of accomplishment.
PublicFreakout,ff5n3ak,t1_ff5jqg3,1579601174.0,"Last February I went to both London and India from the US with my husband and two teenagers.  10/10 would return to India. 0/10 would return to London where a pickpocket attempted to grab a wallet from my 6’4”, broad shouldered husband (which is where I learned he has a decent right swing).  People were rude in every location and I felt unwelcome.  It was expensive and dirty and impatient.   In India, the only description is beautiful madness.  It is breathtaking and filthy.  It is the most opulent wealth and unimaginable poverty.  Delhi is new and ancient.   It is old religion that will scam you in a heartbeat shamelessly.  But most of all, people were kind.  We were treated respectfully in every location, and genuinely welcomed everywhere we went.  We saw no limits in the culture, and for the most part they were as happy to see us as we were to see them."

MSProject,fedry29,t3_eomlqf,1579018603.0,"Udemy.  $10 and quite complete.  BUT it’s a pretty easy self teach of you use other Microsoft products.  If you understand the logic, critical path and PM basics it should be an easy learn in terms of software.  If your learning pm basics use Rita’s PMP study guide and join your local pmi chapter for unlimited learning opportunities. P6 has a difficult user interface, and fast track is good for pretty summary charts."

projectmanagement,fdjnx0q,t3_elnhl6,1578480093.0,"Double click on the task name and assign each task a priority level. If your client deliverable priority is higher than the others, naturally assign at a higher priority level accordingly. Create a milestone that indicates that the Delivery has been completed and mark that as a predecessor for the prioritized client tasks that follow. When the deliverable comes in, click that that milestone has been completed and it should give you everything you need for your sprint prioritized.  It should automatically update all of your resource allocation and a critical path. For your mile stone, ensure that you are marking that it must not start before whatever date the sprint starts. Should the sprint start and it not be completed, remember to change the date to the next to Sprint start. 

Now that said, if the deliverable contains the tasks and priorities themselves, then it won’t be quite so quick. You will need to assign each task a priority level once the deliverable comes in and that could result in some lost time to planning. An hour, a day, a week...all depends on the depth of the client tasks and skill of your scheduler.  You may opt to buffer in some related work that is not deliverable dependent for your resources to tackle while your scheduler tackles that.  Add additional Time if they are giving you a word doc with a list of requirements as opposed to a developed project file that can be inserted as a subproject. Assigning rules to your tasks might also help save some time. For example you could program your file to assign a higher priority to in demand resources that have limited availability, or a lower priority to those deemed so appropriately based on the specifics of your own project.  For one of my files I wrote some visual basic coding that made it much easier to insert as a subproject without overwriting existing predecessors and successors, flag fields, etc between subprojects to both save time and reduce the impact of the human factor, And if you could establish rules based on some constant such as outline level or what not it would be relatively easy to write in rules to assign priority level for you.  You could insert a number field and quickly scroll through assigning 1 to 10, and then have rules established that go into the programming and assign the priority level accordingly, which could greatly reduce the speed in a large file. 

Also, it also might be a stakeholder management issue. Perhaps you need to advise your client that in order to be successful your deliverable needs to be in your hands in a more reasonable amount of time so that you can plan your sprint accordingly. Data driven decision making presentations typically help with this. Prepare the scenario both ways and explain quantitatively the impact to cost and schedule of this deliverable being delayed.  If the client chooses to except the outcome, or finds that the associated cost is unavoidable, then this becomes their problem and not yours."
