TikTokCringe,ffjjqlx,t1_ffjjg1s,1579999794.0,Maybe not thriving but hes married and has access to internet. Im just saying being sent to prison probably wasn't the worst thing in the world for him.
TikTokCringe,ffje4j9,t1_ffjdvlp,1579996345.0,So then what is so interesting about a documentary of the people who were investigating him and were't able to find out who he was without him admitting it? I guess it was kind of a good framing for finding out about all of Luka's freaky internet antics.
TikTokCringe,ffjbt02,t1_ffj5zds,1579994996.0,https://youtu.be/rK3KkLCyZ5k repzion for this video and chris hanson for his many live streams interviewing onision's victims. https://youtu.be/o_0ssuQztj8
TikTokCringe,ffjbmnu,t1_ffj5np8,1579994894.0,"Tldr: onision is a youtuber, groomer, abuser, and neglectful/abusive parent who has been active on youtube for years. He has groomed teenaged girls and transported them over state lines to have sex with them. Hes has teenaged girls live with him and his wife for them to have sex with before breaking them down and those girls have gone to chris hanson for help in taking him down. Recently onision has served two of his critics, Repzion and Chris Hanson, in court for defemation which is what you're seeing here. During the court case Onision had his own case dismissed so the whole thing was a waste of time and money. Girls in the tiktok video are either fans or anti fans in the movement to send onision to prison for his crimes, its unclear."
TikTokCringe,ffjb1zl,t1_ffjau6v,1579994550.0,"Like to be fair and in their defense someone definitely need to find out who he was and stop the kitten killings and they did what they could, but they should have been part of a documentary and not most of the focus of one."
TikTokCringe,ffj7vn0,t1_ffiziqw,1579992583.0,"His partner probably isn't trans. Kai can't settle on an identity and before they went off youtube they said they were agender. Onion in a video taken yesterday wont gender Kai and just keeps calling them a ""person"" and not man or woman. Its worth noting his previous victims and ex girlfriends have all claimed he likes to defeminize them and he seems to hate femininity in general. I am a trans positive person but imo Kai is just confused because of Onion being controlling."
TikTokCringe,ffj7jd5,t1_ffiyjc5,1579992348.0,"You can find videos on youtube of him critiquing the bodies of fans, the youngest of whom was 11 years kld and the average probably like 14. He encourages them to upload body pics to his forum and then he judges them. I guess he's an epehbophile if you want to get technical, but there is very strong reason to believe he is also abusing his toddler. He had a threeway with his partner and one of their victims in the same bed aa their sleeping toddler which is abuse in itself. But he also had her name legally changed to the name of a character he wrote about in his book who he had sex with which is fucking weird. The most telling thing IMO is that over the years hes made obnoxious and unfunny skits that are supposed to be joking but later turned out to have some truth to them, like a video where he makes fun of his partner for begging him to talk to their daughter more and it turns out that really happened. Hes made a video before of him talking to a baby doll like it was his girlfriend. Its strongly believed hes hiding in plain sight behind his ""comedy."""
TikTokCringe,ffj6z0u,t1_ffiwmxh,1579991955.0,"That doc pisses me off because it implied Luka fucked with cats and got taken down by the internet sleuths, but they hardly did anything at all except stoke his ego and ultimately luka got what he wanted which was attention and from what i hear hes thriving in prison. Police would have found out his name even without the sleuths its not like he covered his tracks very well. Idk why they deserved a documentary about them or why it would be named what it was named."

survivorsofabuse,ffiwb21,t1_ffih59h,1579984265.0,"He is an investigative reporter who has had a couple of tv shows about exposing adult men who want to meet up with children for sex.  Right now he has a live stream based show about exposing Onision for grooming and abuse of teenagers, and possible abuse of his toddler daughter. I personally wouldn't reccomend involving him because he doesn't have the best track record of actually incarcerating the chomos as his methods can be considered entrapment, and with the onision case he screwed up the chain of command with a laptop that could have had incriminating evidence against onision."
survivorsofabuse,ffivoqv,t3_etlx8i,1579983829.0,Your dads friends are probably just as big of predators as he is if they think its ok or normal or empowering to sexually exploit a child. I bet he knows them from his trafficking.

I also worked at a job where i was the main source of knowledge. One time a customer asked my coworker what ingredient was in one of our products and she didnt know so she asked me. ""Alexa, what ingredient is in so and so product"" and i started rambling and a customer was so confused because they thought they were asking the voice assisent and it was kind of funny when an actual human answered. I was like ""I am a real human named Alexa and i also answer questions."" I know they didnt have a lot of time to think but it cracks me up that they honestly thought the amazon voice assisent would know the answer to a small business's inventory."

Botchedsurgeries,ffg1bjx,t1_fffjayj,1579896311.0,Last time this was posted someone pointed out that they're comparing them to Victorias Secret Models which isn't really fair because they are a lot more animated than traditional runway models. Not that I think the influencers would be much better if you compared them. James Charles will never not look ridiculous.
MakeupRehab,fffrj3i,t3_et97fr,1579890235.0,So I am a successfully rehabbed makeup addict because its been so long I've been obsessed with makeup that its actually time for me to stock up for the semester. Can anyone direct me to good resources for products? I don't know who to trust for recs anymore. The biggest thing is lip product. I need a lip product i can wear everyday that is low maintence in a berry tone. Mascara i only care about price per oz. Foundation i like l'oreal true match lumi but i want to buy from a more ethical company. Gel eyeliner i need that wont dry out. Aaaand maybe a rec for blush.

wind,ffflhat,t1_ffez3t3,1579886531.0,Your last paragraph just blew my mind. I was told by a wind tech who worked in vermont that its impossible to do that because every country has vastly different standards and you need specialized training for every country. And the head of my program confirmed it. Thank you for clearing up that misconception. My intention is to travel so im happy to hear that.
wind,fffl1c5,t1_fffbe2t,1579886257.0,"For me this was the right choice. I didnt just go to this school to be a tech I was in a really bad situation and i needed time to work on myself and heal from some things that happened. Plus i have made a LOT of mistakes that im glad i made in a school setting and not a job setting. The head of my program is a great guy and hes taught me how to use tools with no judgement because ive never picked up tools before. Ive also learned to brush off when guys are mean to me off really well because i have encountered some mysogyny. If you didnt need to go to school, good for you. Trust me, i needed to. When i have the certificate i will have the tools i need to be professional and not fumble around like an idiot during the training process."

PublicFreakout,ffdh3a8,t1_ffdg460,1579820724.0,"They absolutely are linked, the definition of ethnicity is people who identify with eachother based on share language/culture/history/nation/ancestry. If i saw a black and white guy on a bus it is very possible they are both from the culture of brooklyn, yes, but if you kept taking a random selection of 2 people more often than not they are going to be from different cultures especially if they are from different races. I just think its very silly to try and take someones claim ""on my bus in the city i see many people of different cultures getting along peacefully"" and pull a good old ""well they could all be from the same culture."" Its like something that weird pedantic kid in school would say. You can not walk into anywhere public in America where all white or black people are the same culture, much less 7 different races."

ETA Ethnicity, race, and culture are all different but culture is argueably the most diverse of the 3 so its safe to say if you have multiple people of varied races theyre all probably from different cultures. Unless they're third gen americans in the suburbs who are all part of a marching band."
