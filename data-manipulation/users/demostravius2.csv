unitedkingdom,ffcis3v,t1_ffc5wuh,1579800354.0,"The big issue is nutrient deficiency, of which there are a fair few.

Iron for example is far easier to absorb from meat, and iron deficiency is already very common in the UK. Same with Zinc and the other metals. 

Iodine is another already common one, from vegan sources you are looking at specially fortified foods or seaweed. Iodised salt also works but isn't very common. Most people don't know anything about these, luckily its found in dairy and meat, and especially fish. Iodine deficiency is common and causes a lot of health problems.

Lack of fatty acids is yet another issues, same with protein. These are the building blocks of human cells and both are less common in plant based foods than animal products. Fats in plants are best sourced from coconut, avocado, palm oil and olives. None of which are particularly cheap or environmentally friendly either. Also DHA a vital fatty acid in our brain, isn't found in plants at all. With protein you have a few issues, firstly protein ratio. There are many individual proteins we need, and plants for the most part do not have all of them. Those that do, do not have the correct ratios, they are low in certain amino acids. Add to that and plant proteins are harder for the body to absorb, as humans are not really made to eat large quantities of plants. 

Lack of fats also means lack of fat soluble vitamins, A, D, E and K, and all the problems associated with that. All the B Vitamins are also easier to source from meat products.

Now, I know what a lot of people say, these problems can mostly, all be overcome through supplements, careful planning of diet, shipping in specific foods from abroad, etc. 

The question becomes, will people do that?

The answer is a simple, no. This isn't hypothetical either, it's been tested on the population before. In the 60's/70's we demonised meat and saturated fat. This didn't lead to people switching to healthier fats and becoming fit and healthy. It led to people plugging the gap with more pasta, bread, sugar, potatoes and other refined carbohydrates. End result, the obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cancer epidemics occurred.

I don't see why this time will be any different. The vast majority of people simply will not switch to some hypothetical healthy plant based diet. They will switch to an easy grain and potato based one, and they will get ill. Even current Vegans who tend to be health conscious frequently fail and get sick. There are a few examples of notable ['blogging'](https://nypost.com/2019/05/30/vegan-blogger-eating-meat-after-diet-caused-early-menopause/) vegans becoming ill from doing it wrong.

Another example is calcium. When eaten with Vitamin D (a fat soluble vitamin) it's transferred out of the blood and used in bones. Without it calcium builds up in plaques. If all you look at is plaques and go 'oh no! Calcium is bad!', then we get people promoting 'don't consume too much dairy!', or even more daft skimmed milk. Literally cutting out the vitamin that makes the calcium useful, genius."
AskReddit,ff96q1n,t1_ff961jv,1579706140.0,"It probably does but consider we are not herbivores, humans need meat or alternatives to survive. Alternatives are typically highly damaging as well. Coconuts, avocado and palm oil are the best plant sources of fat and fat soluble vitamins (unless we multi-vitamin as standard. These need shipping in from around the planet and grow in areas where deforestation is a problem. Whereas in the UK at least it's not too hard to source meat fed on grass and rainwater.

Nuts are highly damaging and use more irrigation water than beef. They also need shipping.

I suspect the difference between a healthy vegan diet and a healthy meat based diet are less than claimed and highly location dependant.

The important thing is to find out. Without fully knowing the facts you can't actually fix the problem. It might he better globally for example but worse regionally, so to maximise the effect one region would eat very differently to another."
unitedkingdom,ff8ycff,t1_ff8t3mj,1579699999.0,"Plant based diets are naturally low in protein and fats as well as a lot of nutrients such as Vitamins A, D, E and K, Iron, Zinc, Calcium and Iodine, the fundamental building blocks of life and good health. MODERN vegan diets account for this by adding in supplements and non local foods like coconut/avocado/palm oil, etc.

Producing ROS is a natural part of life, but why would producing more than nessecary therefore be fine? Our bodies are designed to combat some production, it's an important role of omega-3 (which isn't found in grain, btw so yes that is one of the resaons grains cause cancer). Some Vitamin A is good for you, lots will kill you. Your body can cope with breaking a bone, it probably can't cope with breaking all of them. 

Even modern vegan diets show stunting in fact [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864) paper by the American Dietetic Assocciation (which people on reddit LOVE to quote as proof vegan diets are safe, quotes  [this](https://www.scienzavegetariana.it/download/ADAinfants.pdf) paper as it's reference on children, and that says:

> ...subjects tended to be slightly shorter than the median of the reference population...

and

> The reported birth weights of 19 term infants born
to vegan women were slightly lower than infants with nonvegetarian mothers

and

> There is some evidence of early poor growth in infants of macrobiotic women that appears to be due to inadequate amounts of breast milk

Not major stunting as like I said we have filled in a lot of the gaps we had in the past.

As for grains, obviously they do. Cancers are largely caused by ROS and other mutagens, most cancers are driven by the Warburg Effect, this means the consume large amounts of glucose to grow, and cannot/struggle to grow using things like fatty acids, ketone bodies or lactate.

Grains both produce ROS, and provide glucose to the body, a double whammy. The fats in them are not the right fats to provide protection (so if you using grains to replace those fats, it's a tripple whammy). This last point is why vegetable oils are so damaging, the fatty acid compelation is far too high in omega-6 to omega-3, which interupts the bodies ability to absorb free-radicals."

We also half arse research after coming up with hypotheses.

Take the idea plant based diets are best for the environment (maybe they are, maybe there is more to it). The evidence for this so far is based on total calorie production or kilos of protien per tonne of CO2.

Diets are not just calories and protien, they are far more complex, making the data currently collected nothing more than a weak indication. For example I saw an opinion peice recently discussing the difference between chicken and beef. The author was claiming when you look at a complete diet (there isn't even agreement what that is) beef comes out as LESS damaging to the environment than chicken, due to chicken not being a complete food."

Just look at the NHS reference for yourself, it's not good.:

There opening section on meat and cancer (page 106) ends with:

> There are currently no convincing data that provide an explanation for the observed differences in colorectal cancer risk between high consumers of white meat/fish and high consumers of red and processed meat.

Good start.

>The relationship between meat intake and colorectal cancer was previously considered by COMA in their report, Nutritional Aspects of the Development of Cancer (DH, 1998), *which reviewed epidemiological studies* published up to 1996.
The report concluded that evidence from cohort studies was: inconsistent for an association between total meat consumption and risk of colorectal cancer; moderately consistent for a positive association between consumption of red or processed meat and risk of colorectal cancer; and moderately consistent that
poultry (white meat) and fish were not associated with colorectal cancer risk

Consistant correlation doesn't mean causation. 

Later meta-analysis:

> A subsequent meta-analysis included nine cohort studies of red meat and seven cohort studies of processed meat published from 1973 to 1999 (Norat et al, 2002).
Compared to lowest level of intake, the highest level of red meat consumption was associated with a significant increase in colorectal cancer risk (relative risk, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.11-1.45). The relative risk for an increase of 120 g/day of red meat was 1.22 (95% CI, 1.05–1.41). Processed meat was also associated with a significant increase in risk: relative risks were 1.39 (95% CI, 1.09–1.76) for highest compared to the lowest level of intake and 1.54 (95% CI, 1.10–2.17) for an increase of 30 g/day of processed meat. No significant association was found between total meat consumption and colorectal cancer risk.

These are weak af links. Consider smoking and lung cancer have RR around 8, and they are managing 1.54, the strongest links are between processed meat, you know what else people who eat processe meat consume a lot of? Sugar! The cancer causing compound.

Paragraph 7.53 shows later mata-analysis has even weaker links.

From 7.62 they discuss the weaknesses in the studies 

> the association was not statistically significant in most studies

and

> number of methodological inconsistencies between the different
studies which make comparisons difficult

> In most studies, red meat and processed meat intake is based on a single dietary assessment at the start of the study. This does not take account of changes in dietary patterns over a number of years and could therefore be an unreliable estimate of intake over the specified follow-up period.

and

>considerable inconsistencies between studies in categorisation anddefinition of red and processed meat

etc. etc.

It's bad science, with a weak conclusion. To make such a bold claim that a food that has been the primary source of nutrition for 3 million years is suddenly causing us cancer, needs some seriously good evidence to back it up. Correlation studies which don't even hit the bare minimum of 2.0 realtive risk, is not acceptable."

For example: Hominoidea is a HUGE group and sure most apes are/have been herbivorous, but Homo is a carnivorous offshoot, starting from Homo habalis. It's that switch to energy rich meat that allowed our brains to grow huge. It's not uncommon for families to branch off, just look at the Panda, it's a bear that eats bamboo, compare that to the Polar bear.

Gut proportions for example are not the same as other apes, [here](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/133/11/3886S/4818038) the paper discusses the importance of meat and animal products, as well as displaying the differences in gut proportions.

She seems to be trying to prove herself right instead of looking at this objectively for example:

> Modern human nutritional requirements (eg, the need for a dietary source of vitamin C), features of the modern human gut (haustrated colon), and the modern human pattern of digestive kinetics (similar to that of great apes) suggest an ancestral past in which tropical plant foods formed the basis of the daily diet, with perhaps some opportunistic intake of animal matter.

Vitamin C can be obtained from fresh meat in high enough quantity for good health, however a lot more is required when adding carbohydrate to the diet due to how they are metabolised. This is how groups such as the Inuit are fine and not dying of scurvy.

Our colons are very short compared to other apes, trying to use that as a point we are like them is bizzare. Not to mention our digestive system cannot even break down fibre, the core source of energy from plant matter. Gorillas for example break fibre into saturated fat.

[This](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41033-3#ref-CR55) paper looks at isotope analysis to determine diet of late Neanderthal and Early Modern Humans and shows the vast majority of our protein comes from a lot of animal species. 
To then conclude

>Consumption of animal matter to satisfy requirements for protein and many essential micronutrients would free up space in the gut for carbohydrate-rich plant foods and allow for their use as fuel for the increasingly large human brain

Is strange imo, considering there is a tonne of fat even on lean animals, and there are no easily accessible carbohydrate sources. Grain was not yet 'invented', honey was hard to find, and tubers would be uncommon and low yield (hence why when we ate those we only had small brains). Fruit is also seasonal, difficult to reach (we no longer wing around in trees) and not common in East Africa. She then goes on to discuss modern hunter gatherer societies as evidence. However modern societies have been pushed to the edges of the world. They are not a great example, she has also cherry picked examples, mysteriously missing out the ones living off of meat.

> All else being equal, digestible carbohydrates are the most expedient way for humans to obtain glucose, the preferred fuel for the anthropoid brain and one source of glycogen.

This is also false, and unsurprisingly not referenced. Glucose is only required in about 20% of the brain, it's 'preffered' as in it gets used up first because it kills you if it's left in the blood stream. Obviously the body will clear it out asap, that doesn't make it better for the brain. In fact moving away from glucose to fuels such as beta-hydroxybutalate and acetoacetate, shows noticeable improvements in numerous neurological conditions, [1](http://coconutketones.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/KashiyawaVeechBOHBprotectsneurons2000.pdf), [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5816269/), [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458015005916), [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4074854/), [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15166397). It would be a very strange state of affairs if moving away from the brains 'preferred' fuel was a good thing for mental health.

Sorry I can't give more right now, it's getting late, and most of my references are on a usb at work.

There are a bunch of different papers that discuss various related things. [1](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/133/11/3886S/4818038), [2](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/22/10002.full).

Finally if we look in the fossil record there is actually a noticeable [decrease in human skull size](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41464021?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) when we begin farming. This imo is due to the lack of fats and proteins in the diet due to increased grain and decreased meat.

We are after made of fat and protein. If as Katherine Milton suggests we get protein from some meat and then carbs to boost brain power because there is little fat on animals, were does all the fat come from for our cells? Chimps, Gorillas, etc, all convert fibre, and fructose to fats. We cannot convert fibre, and fructose is a rarity."

 It makes no sense at all for meat to cause problems, we have been eating it for 3 million years. We have eaten so much of it, we likely caused the Quaternary Extinction event.
