90DayFiance,fekchhq,t3_eodv25,1579197168.0,"If-if this is a ploy, which is shitty in so many levels, doesn't she realize this public announcement could hurt her family? Like, did they know, did it happen to her sister? What was mom's role, if any? Typical selfish Tania. I'm not saying she shouldn't share her story, I just wonder if she ever thinks of anyone else. I'd be devastated if I learned something like this about a loved one on social media. Tania, life experiences don't equal character, character is who you are regardless of life experiences"

90DayFiance,fe8ko33,t3_eo47pq,1578927222.0,"I hated her so much when she told Mursel he was breaking her children's hearts! Just like she blamed her oldest for Mursel Mursel leaving.

Alzheimers,fdpcydh,t3_em1qqr,1578625486.0,"Does he have sundowners? If I can't get ti showering my mom before 3pm, it's just not going to happen that day. Having everything ready like others have mentioned is super important and remembering that if it's too much, just try a different day. You need to make this easy on you, too! Also, my mom hates bathing I just keep calmly telling her I understand she doesn't want to and that she can do it herself but that I need to check her skin and that it's going to happen. In other words, I don't bargain, plea, or anything, it has to happen and that's it-it kinda compels them a little,,best of luck"
