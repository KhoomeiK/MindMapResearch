AskReddit,ffbdygm,t1_ff9tdac,1579761231.0,"> Spirit can save you a little bit of money if you go in knowing exactly what they're up to. If not, you’ll end up paying more. 

This is exactly why I will never fly Spirit — the business model literally depends on people not understanding what they are buying. They aren’t going for repeat customers, necessarily. They scoop up people who don’t travel much (think: the seniors who travel once every year or so to see the grandkids, and aren’t knowledgeable about the offerings) and then once the “cheaper” Spirit ticket is purchased, the airline hits them with a bunch of additional fees the consumer doesn’t expect. 

It’s not illegal or anything, but I’m not interested in supporting that kind of business model. I have intentionally, knowingly paid more for other airlines (including when I was on quick 48-hour turnarounds that would’ve been optimally aligned with Spirit’s stripped-down approach) just because I refuse to support Spirit on principle. And I certainly don’t want Spirit’s model to trickle out to other mainstream airlines, so I’ll vote with my dollars on this. 

Relatedly, it bothers me that Spirit does full body paint on their aircraft. Most airlines do limited custom paint, typically focused on the tail. Custom paint jobs add money. Paint on aircraft also adds weight. Full body paint (like the Spirit all-over yellow) adds cost and not-insignificant weight, and that extra weight in turn impacts efficiency. For a “budget” airline, that’s unnecessarily extravagant. I’m not going to pay extra for a carry-on, especially on an airline that *is* paying extra for branding paint, and passing that on to the consumer."

blogsnark,ff7byjv,t1_ff773aq,1579645955.0,"William and Harry both got a respite from starting official full-time royal duties while they were in school and serving in the armed forces. 

The timing of that obviously was a huge benefit for Kate and William, as it occurred when they were just starting out in their marriage and afforded them more privacy and private time together than they could realistically expect to have once they started working. I’ve said before that I think it’s unfortunate that the timing didn’t work out the same way for Harry and Meghan — in their case, they were already in their mid-thirties, Harry was no longer actively serving and he had already begun (what everyone then expected to be) his long term role as a full-time working royal. While I think this really was just a timing issue, I hope in the future it will become standard for newly married royal couples to get some downtime before ramping up again, regardless of age and timing. 

> The biggest difference was that he was willing to stay in the U.K.

This is an epically massive difference and simply cannot be understated. There is zero precedent for an official working member of the BRF to live in another country (Commonwealth or not). The entire point of the working BRF is that they are in the U.K. and actively appearing at engagements across the U.K.. 

Asking to go to part-time work in the U.K. just because you want to do less official work and live on another continent is a huge request. By all means, shoot your shot — nothing to lose by asking — but it’s also entirely reasonable for the BRF to expect that Harry work full time, and to expect him to do that work in the U.K.."

blogsnark,ff6tcw0,t1_ff55l24,1579634473.0,"> But they didn’t get their book deals or their Netflix deals because they’re Ivy League educated lawyers with significant executive experience. 

Yes they did. That’s *where* the public interest came from: experience in high-profile elected office, both legislative and executive. Obama initially published his first memoir in the 90s and to my knowledge it didn’t get a ton of sales at the time, but when his political star suddenly rose in the early 00s, the book was republished and it absolutely exploded as a critical and popular success. Obviously being an Ivy League educated lawyer (and a good writer) wasn’t enough to boost sales in the nineties, but becoming a senator certainly did the trick. Nobody really cared before he became a big-name politician. 

So yes, got most those deals in large part due to their achievements and executive experience. They are the former president and former First Lady. Virtually all former presidential couples have similar opportunities at the conclusion of their terms — book deals are incredibly common, and pretty much all of them have become bestsellers. 

The Obamas have even more opportunities and success than most, both because of their popularity and because stuff like social media exists to continue platform-building, and the emergence of Netflix, etc provide additional options beyond just a book or tv interview. Popularity is a huge factor for the Obamas of course, but even Clinton — who left office basically in shame after a sex scandal and impeachment — immediately got a big book deal and commanded huge speaking fees. 

> They got those deals because there’s a ton of public interest in them, which will automatically convert to sales and views. Which is also true for Harry and Meghan.

Again, the massive public interest in the Obamas stems from their life in democratically-elected public service. He was elected US senator and that kicked off major interest and popularity, and then he won two presidential elections. Millions of voters turned out for him, and he was head of state for a country of over 300 million people. He will always be a point of historical interest, even if general social/cultural interest wanes (which is unlikely at this rate), and because of his presidential experience he will always be part of the conversation in the US and a source for insight and informed commentary whenever he chooses to share it. 

This is *not* true for Harry and Meghan, who fell into this role by a coincidence of birth and marriage (respectively). Yes they are famous and there is a lot of interest in them, especially right now, but the endurance of that interest is far from certain, and it’s not clear whether or how they can sustainably monetize it in the short or long term. Since Harry hasn’t achieved anything specific independent of inherited role, it would be hard to put a value on him for something like major speaking engagements, for example, which are extremely lucrative for any former president."
blogsnark,ff6pyjh,t1_ff6eh4f,1579632443.0,"I don’t get why Trump being in office is part of this rumored equation at all. It seems strange to me that a US citizen would base a long-term residency decision on the presidential administration. I know people joke about “moving to Canada” in protest of the election of a president they dislike, but I’ve never known anyone who actually did that for specifically that reason. 

Didn’t Meghan live in the US at least part time for at least the early part of the Trump administration anyway? She and Harry will always live an extremely privileged lifestyle wherever they are, and their lives in America wouldn’t be noticeably different no matter what president is in office."
blogsnark,ff6ozxa,t1_ff6ht87,1579631868.0,"I’m completely disgusted by Andrew. 

That said, this column is extremely misleading, to the point that the author seems to willfully misunderstand or mischaracterize the Sussexes’ situation. Harry isn’t being “forced out,” let alone as a punishment for his behavior. Andrew should be punitively shunned (or at least not publicly supported) by his family, but isn’t. These situations are not remotely comparable. 

Harry wanted to leave his full-time role in the U.K. for a part-time role split between Canada/US and the U.K., and was told that a part-time royal role wasn’t possible but that he could choose to either remain full-time for the royal family or not at all. He keeps his titles and honors and will continue to receive millions from his dad each year. The Sussexes chose this situation for themselves, and in fact actively campaigned to reduce their role and engaged in negotiations that led to this precise outcome. 

Harry chose to stop working as a royal, and his not working is not a punishment. Andrew did not stop working by his own choice, but rather it is a direct consequence for his abominable behavior — his patronages and partnerships dropped him hard and fast, and subsequently the BRF announced he would no longer be working (likely not to punish Andrew as he deserves, but to save face once it became clear he couldn’t possibly continue working publicly). Yes, Andrew is getting by way more easily than he deserves, but that is a totally separate problem that is unrelated to the Sussexes’ choices. 

There’s plenty of drama to be made out of all of this without distorting reality even further."

news,few7iw6,t1_fev4dhz,1579406449.0,"Harry has always received most of his funding from his father, Prince Charles, who in turn has a great deal of annual income from the [Duchy of Cornwall](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Cornwall). The Duchy is comprised of lands and an investment portfolio that provides income to the Prince of Wales (so when Charles becomes King, Prince William will become Prince of Wales and and the Duchy will pass to him). The Duchy has been known to generate £20M+/year for the Prince of Wales, and Charles also chooses to pass some of that income on to each of his sons. 

Harry and Meghan have only said that they won’t be taking “taxpayer money” (Sovereign Grant) anymore, but aside from the Frogmore residence renovation, only a small percentage of their expenses was ever covered from that source. Their security is also covered by the U.K. government, but apparently from a separate part (not royal-specific) of the budget that also covers security for other U.K. dignitaries as necessary. 

Harry also inherited millions from his mother and the Queen’s mother (his great-grandmother), supposed to be in the range of £30M, maybe more. He likely hasn’t had to touch much of it, as he’s always gotten free housing and basic expenses (they had a chef at Windsor, for instance) and such. That’s a lot of money as it is, and he may have more from sources that aren’t publicly known, but the actual costs of his lifestyle likely far, far exceed his own personal wealth. 

From the sounds of it so far, their security will still be covered, and they will probably continue to accept a great deal of money from Prince Charles, at least for the time being."
blogsnark,fev9kiw,t1_fetuzs8,1579394772.0,"Right. I’m sure the Sussexes had shared their feelings some time earlier, and were told it would take some time and consideration before serious talks would move forward. I think this came shortly before their decision to take the six week hiatus in Canada. I suspect that break was a mutual decision between the Sussexes and the Palace, perhaps borne out of disagreement over the Sussexes’ wishes and the next steps, and maybe hope that some time away trying out life in Canada would make the Sussexes reconsider an exit."
blogsnark,fev7ctp,t1_fev4xno,1579394010.0,"Yes, they’ve been married for less than two years. It’s all happened insanely fast. 

I really wish they would’ve given it more time in their roles in the U.K.. The past two years brought a lot of change for them that would’ve been a huge adjustment for anyone, even without being high profile working royals. New country, marriage, living around all the in-laws, pregnancy, having a baby, returning to work after leave. Those things are hard for everyone. Life has many seasons and some of them are really, really hard and even unhappy while you are in them, but often it gets better and feels better over time. 

I sincerely hope that this change accomplished what the Sussexes hope it will, and gives them the life they want — it seems to have come at some cost, and I hope it proves worthwhile for them. Standing on the outside watching it unfold, it does seem hasty, and I wonder if maybe during this stressful time they have determined that the official engagements, royal rota, and tabloids are “the problem” and that moving to Canada and quitting their official roles will “solve it.” I hope for their sake that they are right, and that this move isn’t just a change of scenery with the same tabloid issues, and that two years from now (and beyond) they are still happy with their decision."
blogsnark,feuhgne,t1_fetolaf,1579386587.0,"It’s possible all of the statements are fairly accurate:

When Harry and Meghan posted the announcement and launched their website with their “plan,” they claimed they had the support and knowledge of the rest of the BRF and the BRF indicated they were surprised by the announcement, and later said plans were not formalized and still in early discussion. 

In reality, H&M *had* informed the Queen of their wish and intention to change their roles, and there were likely some kind of preliminary discussions or communications about what that might look like. The BRF *had not* approved (or been given much, if any, prior notice of) H&M’s IG post or the website content. So the royal family had discussed things, things were at “an early stage” because things weren’t close to being finalized (despite what was presented as resolved details on the Sussex site and post) and at the time the BRF probably had no plans to finalize things so quickly, and the BRF was blindsided by the timing, nature, and content of the Sussex announcement. 

The Queen’s statements are fairly consistent. The Sussex statements have been adjusted to reflect that their preliminary announcement was not an accurate reflection of the final approved plan, but if you squint just right, give everyone the benefit of the doubt, and adjust for self-promotion and PR spin, things more or less align."

If there is a clean break, then perhaps Trooping for Archie's balcony debut and that is about it.

I think it’s possible that they would attend some of these events — Trooping the Color especially — even if they had no working royal roles at all. Trooping is the one event where basically everyone shows up, even family members a generation or so removed from public royal life. At least, I think the BRF would like the Sussexes to attend, not only for public appearances (although that’s important) but also because it is a significant annual family event."
