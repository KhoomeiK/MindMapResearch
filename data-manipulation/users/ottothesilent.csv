Rey in TFA can clearly fight with a staff, can use a blaster, etc. Finn has some proficiency with a saber, but Rey is better than him. Neither of them fight a trained saber user in anything approaching an even or fair fight. Kylo stomps Finn after being shot by a weapon shown to obliterate stormtroopers, and then puts up a fairly bad fight against a relatively uninjured Rey, ending with extenuating circumstances, when the planet collapses. In TLJ Rey gets some saber practice, doesn’t put up anything resembling a fight against Kylo, and kills a couple non-Force wielding guards, and is clearly strained in doing so, whereas Kylo stomps many more than she does. She and Kylo then engage in a Force duel, which neither wins, but which is not dependent upon training, but Force power. Fast forward to ROS, after training for an indeterminate period, and being distressed and angry, she is nearly beaten by Kylo, and is clearly about to die, when Leia intervenes, resulting in Kylo receiving a mortal wound, which she heals. Following this, she is not engaged in any more saber fuels of note, whereas Kylo destroys half a dozen elite fighters that were about to kill him. 

None of Rey’s saber displays against Force wielders are anything resembling conclusive victories in her own right. She wins against wounded or incapacitated enemies, or enemies not using the Force."

PrequelMemes,fd7n5cx,t1_fd7hdb1,1578207045.0,"I meant Palpatine’s scream with a 720 spin, but yeah. Point being, there are constantly new applications of the Force being shown to us, in ways that directly contradict previous films, like how 80 year old Dooku could best two 20-somethings in a duel when Ben Kenobi could barely walk without a cane at 50. Star Wars is and always has been fantasy, and that means it’s always about extraordinary people in extraordinary circumstances, so of course the heroes have to keep topping themselves, because if we had some arbitrary list of what the Force could do, it would be pointless and dumb. 

I think a much better way to handle Force healing other than questioning its existence is to question why we haven’t seen it, *in context*. Why would an order of warrior monks be opposed to supernatural healing? Well, they seem to be pretty big on not intervening when possible, and perhaps they view the use of the Force for such means as defying the natural order as selfish or immoral. And the Sith probably can’t do it because they are inherently selfish. So if one faction chooses not to use it, and the other can’t, and both factions are more or less extinct by the time ROS rolls around, it is definitely plausible that we’d see it. It’s not that the Jedi couldn’t do it, it’s probably more like the ones who knew about it chose not to, and guarded the knowledge carefully, because fear leads to anger, etc."

It’s a Maserati in that its driven by a douchebag with tribal tattoos to his job at the pawn shop.

Jedi are taught from birth to use restraint and to lock away their feelings, using the Force as a conduit. Rey, on the other hand, uses the Force as a tool, and so only a very powerful Force user without the discipline of the Jedi could ever hope to tap into the Force with such emotion that destruction ensues on that level. Kylo has that training, plus Dark Side training, and never managed lightning, despite also being extremely powerful."
