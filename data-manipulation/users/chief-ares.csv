bipolar2,fekttk5,t3_epnsry,1579207464.0,"Mine last a couple of months on average.

I get a large amount of energy, much larger than other months. I get a lot of working, cleaning, going outside done. Other people can’t keep up because I want to constantly be doing something, anything, regardless of time. I sleep less, but I don’t wake up tired. I can wake up to a mouse scratching, then it’s off to do more work regardless of time. I usually injure myself because my body can’t keep up to the demands of my energy levels. Spending gets a little out of control, well completely out of control.

It’s still better than the depressed stage."
RiseofKingdoms,fekrroi,t1_fekqkc6,1579206254.0,"I’d take care running T5 as a F2P versus other players. That’s a good way to make yourself broke. The healing and training rss and speed of T5 is crazy versus T4. Good advice from Chisgule and Shinchi is F2P don’t run T5 versus players. Use T5 against neutral units, and let the whales use T5s against players."
bipolar2,fds3z2t,t1_fdr2kt8,1578693899.0,"The first part is my typical therapist advice when depressed. Small steps are good, but they can be a nightmare.

I’m not sure about the society expectations. When hypomanic, society can’t keep up :/. Friends can’t keep up with me. It’s a complete reversal that I haven’t been able to manage. But it feels better than when I’m in the depressed wave.

Getting outside feels amazing when not depressed, otherwise it’s hard to do it. Drinking feels sooo good, but it makes me spend so much when hypomanic. Sleep is completely hit and miss. My depressed self welcomes it, my hypomanic self says no thanks. I have never found a way to manage sleep."
bipolar,fdob9ai,t1_fdo62vv,1578602068.0,"I agree.

Just willing myself out of bed is still a big chore when depressed - and that small will wouldn’t have been possible without a few therapists. Exercise? That’s like going to the moon when depressed - it’s not happening.

Sleep schedules? Well too much sleep when depressed and too little sleep when hypomanic. There’s no setting a sleep schedule when my brain doesn’t care."
bipolar,fd5tg8c,t1_fd0fvfl,1578181315.0,"My therapists mentioned to me that it was not a good idea to be upfront with my advisor, so I never mentioned it to them. Somehow, I got through it, even though I was a mental disaster."

RiseofKingdoms,fd39joh,t3_ejuoma,1578156034.0,"Well you should buy Growth fund first. You get insane value at CH23 with it.

VIP 12 is more important than Mina.

If you do want to buy more Mina sculps, then you should go at least 5511. The higher level VIP chests get more expensive, so it will start to cost a lot to get Mina higher skill level. You do get a lot of books for castle, among other stuff with the higher level chests. So, the chests could be a good investment if you’re planning for CH25. You’re going to need a lot of books, that you’ll likely buy most of with gems.

Chisgule, Rhony, and Shinchi have a lot of civilization feature info. I’d suggest checking them out. If you don’t want to spend a lot of money, I’d suggest not changing your civilization again until late game. Change to the civilization that benefits what troop type you specialize in."
BipolarReddit,fcznk61,t1_fcfr6gq,1578105124.0,"There’s an Amazon wishlist? I kid, partially. For me, things only go there when I’m depressed.

Cash is also something that doesn’t work well for me while manic. That’s easy spending for me. Card is easier for me because then I have to input all the information and a signature, ugh."
RiseofKingdoms,fcxsg7w,t3_ej7ph5,1578069787.0,"Getting a refund isn’t going to be helpful for you unless you plan on quitting the game entirely.

This is the nature of P2W games. If you don’t have the money or would be upset with losing what you spent, then you shouldn’t be spending real money. At least, don’t spend money on troops unless you’re willing and ok with losing that money. In these games, there’s always a bigger fish that could take all your troops from you.

As you’re only $850 in, it shouldn’t take you too long to train everything back. A couple months max. Find a peaceful alliance or kingdom, farm and train to rebuild what you had."
RiseofKingdoms,fcxj94q,t1_fcwwlks,1578064295.0,"Well Chisgule, Rhony, Shinchi always say those packs all F2P should be buying. Sure they’re not pure F2P, but they’re very limited in their spending, and spending on the best value (aside from Fate Changer) in the game."
RiseofKingdoms,fcvq0el,t1_fctsck3,1578007499.0,"I half agree with you. I’m in big spending alliances, and I get a large amount of free VIP each day. As long as you carry your weight in these alliances, you’ll accumulate enough free VIP for level 12 quick and easy.

I don’t agree with your last part. Yeah T5 will always be stronger than T4, but if you have max T4 tech and the right commander pairs, you’re going to hurt a T5 player. You won’t win, but you’re not going to get blown out either."
RiseofKingdoms,fcvp985,t3_eit286,1578007017.0,"If in doubt about this, always spin the wheel until you can summon the commander (Alex in this case). The wheel gives some of the best rewards of all the events. So it’s never a bad investment. After you summon, then you can use gold heads to continue leveling the skills if you’re F2P."
bipolar2,fcr9oba,t3_eikejd,1577898798.0,"I’m new here as well.

I think everyone’s mood cycles are different. For me, I tend to stay in one phase for months, then start heading towards the opposite phase. Currently manic since August."
RiseofKingdoms,fcnh31j,t1_fcndfnu,1577811565.0,"Wheel of Fortune is an event that shows up every 2-3 weeks. They run in series with 1 universal wheel followed by 3 commander wheels, then restarting that order. A new kingdom will see it a few weeks after it began."
RiseofKingdoms,fcm34tq,t1_fclsp0x,1577763002.0,"If you’re a F2P, your role isn’t doing damage. Your role is support. You need good support commanders, like Joan, or tanky commanders with support commanders.

Damage commanders are for higher spenders and whales. You certainly should never ever be hitting cities or reinforced structures as a F2P. You’ll just break yourself. Those roles are for whales.

Richard is fine for all roles. Plenty of players still use him all the time in old kingdoms. I was just watching a fight in LK in a really old kingdom, and over half the primary commanders were Richard."
RiseofKingdoms,fcm0b9s,t3_eht3xk,1577760908.0,"You didn’t mess up that badly.

You get Cao Cao statues from keys, so he can be saved.

You’re Mina is boned. You can buy the rest of his vip packs over time to save him.

Charles is Ok. Not in a great spot, but again you can get his sculptures from keys, so not boned.

Your Richard is boned. If he’s not on your wheel anymore, then you’re going to need some money to save him. That or just save gold heads and only put them into your Richard for a long time.

Check Chisgule or Shinchi or Rhony for pairings."
RiseofKingdoms,fclznub,t1_fcltzqv,1577760433.0,He’s not bad. It’s nice of Lilith to give us a lot of his statues just for logging in.
RiseofKingdoms,fckiz2o,t1_fckh7wa,1577726369.0,"Oh sorry, I read through too fast.

I’d level YSG. Don’t bother with Charles. Then Alex, and eventually Constantine for infantry focus.

I know this isn’t what you’re asking about, but I’d suggest also to have some good epic cavalry and mixed troop commanders for now. It’s going to take a while to get good sets of infantry commanders online, but that’s late game. Cavalry is too good early/mid game. Pela/Beli will fill your speed gap if you don’t already have them maxed."
RiseofKingdoms,fckegnc,t3_ehhs6t,1577723506.0,"If you invested in the Richard wheels and plan to have mostly infantry, then getting Richard to 5551 is very good even into late game.

YSG is also a commander that you should invest in, but probably not down the archery talents if you’re not spending a lot of money. He’s a great secondary commander in a lot of roles.

Alex is a good commander for infantry, but if you’re going to go that path, then you should invest in Richard first, then later Alex.

Charles is a good garrison commander, and you get his sculptures from gold keys. I wouldn’t invest gold heads into Charles.

Cao Cao is a good gatherer hunter and barb hunter, pairs well with Mina, and you get his sculptures from gold keys. You also get his sculptures from the daily treasure chests ($6 USD/day). Again, I wouldn’t invest gold heads into him.

If you’re not spending money, unlock those commanders, then concentrate on only one at a time. Level their first skill first please.

Chisgule made a recent video of what legendary commanders you should invest gold heads into and commanders you shouldn’t invest them into. I’d suggest checking into that if you’re interested in more.

Edit: Seeing as you are F2P, you should be heavily investing in epic commanders and only leveling one legendary at a time. Unlock the legendaries you are interested in so you can level them later.

Beli is an epic Cao Cao. Pelagius/Osman are epic Mina. Scipio is kind of/barely an epic Richard/Alex. I’d suggest support/integration Joan rather than gathering."
