4000 watch hours is only like 50-100k views depending on video length and retention.  That would only be $50-200 of profit anyways.

NewTubers,feof1yp,t3_eq0ish,1579299217.0,"The reason you are told to upload regularly is not for the algorithm.  It is for the fact that if your subscribers know that you release a video on a schedule, it is more likely to get more subscriber views. YouTube likes to see the largest percent of your subscribers viewing your video as possible. This means that people come back to YouTube because of your content.

A schedule to upload regularly also puts pressure on you to always make new videos. Making new content will bolster your catalog. Increase chances of your videos being recommended by other videos of your own and others. You'll get more residual views, more subscribers on all the residual and more chance for discovery of your new videos. 

The effect builds up over time. If you pump out fake videos it will only damage the quality of your channel and make anyone subscribed to you annoyed. They will either unsubscribe or turn off notifications. Your percent of subscriber views will drop and YouTube will really hate your channel then."

NewTubers,feksqnx,t3_eplwmr,1579206825.0,"I would say that unless the videos you are leading people to have a strong sales funnel, a profitable product, or affiliate link, there is no reason to run ads to your channel. It will waste mo ey and give almost no growth. You would have to spend thousands to get to 1000 subscribers and 4000 hours of watch time. 

You money is better invested in a great microphone and a good camera. Another investment would be a good computer to edit on. These will be investments that will continually yield good quality and sustainability to your channel. You can grow for way cheaper by making good content. There is no reason to pay money to drive people to bad content. Good unique content when made consistently will get pushed by the YouTube algorithm eventually and yield you greater results than you could ever pay for. 

Running ads is not efficient because it takes hundreds of dollars and thousands of impressions for Google to even begin to really know who to send your ads to in order to be effective. Unless you have experience with ads, stop the ad campaign right now and use the money elsewhere. 

If you are really stuck on using ads and truly believe it is your silver bullet, you can go and take the courses from Google ads Academy. They are free, and made by Google to teach you how to use their ad program."

The ads can be effective along side the effect of the kids wanting whatever is advertised and asking the parents for it. 

Directly targeting adults with good household incomes directly is like $6-12 per thousand views up to $50 per thousands views.

The first is Graham Stephan. Obviously he has 3 years of experience on YouTube and has grown his reputation over time, but really exploded this last year.  His videos are straight forward, applicable to anyone, and entertaining while still being simple. He lives frugally and so despite being a million remains fairly relatable. He has some courses, but barely ever mentions them at all. He seems very genuine. 

Andrei jihk: He is a professional Editor and Cardisty expert who is personally interested in finance. He lived in a van and saved like 200k in 5 years working a normal job and teach alot of aspects of living very frugal and earning and investing from the standpoint of a normal person. He has high production quality and is personable. He only started this last year and has grown incredibly fast. He doesn't try to shove courses down your throat. He just teaches. 

Marko - Whiteboard Finance. He has been in the finance Youtube game for a few years, but as pretty good views as far as finance goes. His videos are not great camera or audio quality, and he does everything in front of a whiteboard, but he explains things very well and comes off as very relatable and not trying to shove products and services down your throat.  


The last and probably most Entertaining and more about Making money is Biaheza. I discovered this channel Pletty early, but he is only like 19 or 20. He teaches you how to make money from very little or even from nothing. He focuses mostly on drop shipping, but has since branched to many types of side hustles and does interesting challenges where he has to make money withing certain guidelines. For a money Making / finance channel, he is popping off fast. He went from like 10k subs to 200k very quick. His videos have amazing views for the niche and his CPM is like $30-50. His thumbnail game is on point because he was racking in hundreds of thousands of views even when he had less than 10k subs. 

I would say to look at these channels and see what you feel like you can do. See what they do that works. And then find your own spin or mix on it.
