They could fire almost 2x the rate of French ships which is huge when one or 2 can cut down a mast or clear a deck with grape shot.

That and the quality of captains who whilst all were nobility as was standard in most of Europe, a lot stand out as very able seamen.  

Google Thomas Cochrane.  It's insane some of the feats he pulled off against larger ships and bigger crews but even the brilliance and audacity he showed in battles and the amount of ship he captured was amazing in a time of sail.  Sadly he upset too many superiors so only rose so high and his promotions were slow and only awarded after feats that higher ranked captains could only dream of.  Nelson was impressive for his genius but if Cochrane had risen to an admiral who knows what he may have done."

The whole reason  we are able to increase plant and cereal yields is thanks to GMO selection and heavy use of fertiliser and pesticides. Don't believe me? I bet you go to a supermarket and almost all carrots, pears and other veg are the same strain, Apple have some variety but not because some grow in certain areas. We've created a monoculture. Meat industry requires same plant based products to feed then yes but trying to argue over efficiency is pears and apples.
