Advice,ff6lmrh,t1_ff2vysr,1579629826.0,"When I was in college looking for my first real job, my roommates and I quantified the *shit* out of everything. Luckily we all had campus jobs, and one roommate and I had food service jobs. 

She put on her resume, ""SAGA/Marriott - Arrived at work six days a week to prepare approximately 600 donuts for student dining hall breakfast.""

She got a lot of ""Time to make the donuts!"" jokes from potential hiring managers. It was a great attention-getter and conversation starter!

A lot of young people ride the bus to and from school, as did I, riding MUNI in San Francisco as a 4th/5th grader.

We learned urban bus etiquette pretty damn quick, and I'm happy to see these values passed down. The middle-schoolers (and I know they are bcz they're wearing their magnet school polos) always stand and leave the priority seats for Elders and disabled.

Even the Moms with a kid on their back and a double stroller will move to the back if it's crowded and Elders/Disabled need seats. 

And I sure do appreciate that, because it can't be easy. Point is, we're all in this together and we help each other out. Gave up your seat for me? Yeah, despite my balance issues I'll totally help you and your kids get off of the bus at your stop."

Wrap in WonTon wrappers and fry in oil.

It would be very easy (probably even proper) to add some chopped raw shrimp or crabmeat into the mix.
