Instagramreality,ffdrt84,t3_et1fvg,1579827351.0,Glad to see my huge stupid hips are finally trendy. I'd give anything for a flat butt and a narrower frame. I stick out like a sore thumb among my (Chinese) relatives especially compared to my extremely slim and petite sister. We all want what we don't have.

fatlogic,ffcpivu,t1_ffbzc6r,1579804470.0,"Yep, that's correct! It's not so much thin so much as every single one of our relevant measurements will be smaller. My sister is 5'5"" and hearing her measurements would scare the shit out of a large portion of Americans. But she's fine. She's just extremely EXTREMELY narrow all around. I am considered ""big"" (and chubby...) by Asian standards but here are mine: 5'7"", 31/25/33. I permanently suffer from the curse of pants either being too short or don't stay up so I actually buy almost all my clothes from Asian brands. A lot of them have ""tall size"" these days (of course ""tall size"" still equals under 5'8"")."

I'm really enjoying the glossy skin and lips trend right now.

And finally I love the finish of the Lux Liquid Lipsticks from Colourpop. When they have a sale I'm definitely going to get a few shades. Totally digging the new soft matte look for matte lips. It's not as drying and gives such a velvet soft look"

BeautyGuruChatter,ff79gwx,t1_ff6lu72,1579643846.0,I've been looking into getting a nicer one (I hate to just throw things away for the sake of saving $$$). I know some Asian Youtubers online like the one by Panasonic.
BeautyGuruChatter,ff6fuez,t3_ertdzv,1579626285.0,"I think this is silly and wasteful, but as an aside, I have ruler-straight, stubborn, Chinese lashes and they are just absolutely ridiculous to deal with. My mascara routine takes 10 - 15 minutes just on its own, and lash lifts in my area are 95 - 120 dollars so it's just not worth it.

First I curl my lashes. I walk up my lashes, curling, curling, curling. I warm up the curler on my neck or between my boobs first.

Then I apply mascara. First I concentrate on my roots since if I put too much on the tips, whoosh down my lashes go. Then I slowly work my way up to the tips with what's left on the brush.

Even with the most waterproof mascara ever (Kiss Me Heroine Make) my lashes start drooping ANYWAYS. Yay me. So as the mascara is almost dry, I take my lash curler and clamp down one more time, this time for longer, like Wayne Goss just did.

Now FINALLY I'm done. And they'll stay curled for...eh....3 hours. :\\

&#x200B;

EDIT to add: In Korea and China a lot of people heat a stick with a lighter and then curl with that. There's lots of videos on Youtube about it. While I can vouch for it, it's time consuming and very dangerous if not done right. But it is really nice for melting in the mascara, and it's much gentler on the lashes than pulling around with a lash curler."

BeautyGuruChatter,fes4e84,t3_eqckpg,1579361303.0,I fostered my first kitten this past October and Jesus the amount of work involved had me running on empty almost every day. I love him to bits and I'm so proud of how far he's come (he came in so sick we thought he'd die overnight) but it's work. And that's just kittens. Once they are weaned they're much less work than a puppy. My in laws straight up sent theirs to obedience school for a week. And the trainers there said he was one of the most difficult dogs they've ever worked with. In the end the only thing that calmed him down was just growing up into an adult dog.
BeautyGuruChatter,fes3w3g,t1_ferpc3l,1579361124.0,"Thank you :3

People often don't realize there's a huge variety of senior animals, especially with cats. I adopted my oldest last year (15 yr old) and his most recent blood panel came back so healthy the vet was astounded. He recently wanted to start going outside so now we go on walks every morning together (harness and leash, of course). The neighbors don't believe me that he's 15. So I always encourage people to give the oldies a chance. Some of them still have a ton of spunk!"
BeautyGuruChatter,fes32bm,t1_fes15xd,1579360929.0,Some rescues offer opportunities to be permanent fosters for their senior and special needs animals! That offers the best of both worlds -- an otherwise unwanted animal can have a fulfilling happy home and the owner doesn't have to worry about cost of care. The shelter I work at only let's a few trusted people do it but each rescue is different.

lostgeneration,fekensg,t1_feiepnf,1579198460.0,"Yes holy shit TVs are everywhere unless you're at a small business family owned place (and even then sometimes they're there). I grew up watching little more than PBS Kids (Dragon Tales, Mister Rogers...) And when I hit high school I stopped altogether. I remember my mom haggling down the internet bill by cutting out our cable altogether when I was little and thus I never had cable. When we went on vacations I would treat myself to binge watching Animal Planet. But now even their network shows have become stupid and boring...

Christianity,fei0g5c,t3_ep4vdy,1579127598.0,"Our previous pastor was very open about his personal demons (molested as a child, absentee/abusive father, etc), and preached frequently about the most vulnerable people as well as giving really applicable sermons to those at a low point in their life. He was relatable and kind and I felt like I could trust him with anything. He was speaking for people like me and would constantly remind the congregation about it's duty to help others and support one another. We were all always asking each other how we were all doing, and meaning it 100%

Our current pastor just constantly preaches all the feel good stuff. Everyone claps and yells and says AMEN. He doesn't tackle any hard topics. He just plays it safe and then at the end of each sermon he says very brusquely that ""pray harder Jesus will fix everything"". I feel completley and utterly isolated each time I go to the point where I've stopped going. My in-laws one afternoon were like ""He had a very powerful word on depression today!"" I got all excited only to find out it was ""He told us, 'Jesus can overcome anything!'"". Neither powerful not exciting. Thanks.
