marketing,ferri2a,t1_ferpqmu,1579357518.0,"Thanks - would you consider it on a monthly basis?  I can't think longer than that makes sense, at least to begin.  The first month would be much more expensive though, IMO because of all the startups.  They don't have any social pages at all. I'd be doing all those, plus some graphics."

**Title of Request:** Looking for fresh, more interesting, exciting strategic games to add to the closet - A step up, but not super complex

**Number of Players:** 2-6

**Game Length:** 30-90 minutes

**Complexity of Game:** Light to Medium

**Your Budget:** $40

**Genre:** Open to most, have trouble getting my family on board with medieval or fantasy themes

**Competitive or Cooperative:** Competitive

**Games I Own/Like or Dislike:** Have always only played and loved the basics - chess, sequence, balderdash, farkle, lol

Looking for something just a touch up from these (chess is arguable I know).  We purchased Avalon and Werewolf, they were just a bit too much. We have very little time so learning ourselves plus teaching older family members has been too troublesome to this point."
