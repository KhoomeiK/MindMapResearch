sports,ff8jznx,t1_ff8h1lu,1579682081.0,I was being sarcastic. With the exception of ice hockey its pretty neutral.
worldnews,ff8jvzd,t1_ff80krr,1579681936.0,"I agree with you and also understand the pros/cons. It’s just in the modern world that we are in now, I would have thought a robust and sensitive system could have been devised. I think the religious aspect of society plays a part in slowing stuff like this down, even for the non-religious out there."
sports,ff6y1a4,t1_ff6wvn2,1579637229.0,"I wouldn’t call American Football or Baseball global sports, and Hockey is pretty niche.  I think of them on par with Rugby, Cricket and Snooker for global popularity.  

Golf, yeah you most of the top 10 players, but you’re also 5x the population of places like the UK that have a few in top 10. US women are good at tennis, but I wouldn’t say they dominate any more, and I can’t think of any men."

But thinking about it, apart from athletics , what global sports do the US dominate?"

NoStupidQuestions,fexfaeo,t1_fevnval,1579430051.0,I think they were talking about the fact that the old man said to go to the US for history.

NoStupidQuestions,fexdfyp,t1_fesq133,1579429148.0,"One of the points everyone is missing is the size of the US. The US’s population is about 5 times larger than the UK, which has 3 in the top 10 and >10 in top 100. Relatively, that makes the UK better!

I’m pretty sure that if you added all the European countries together, there would be more than the US. And although they’re all funded differently, I suspect that the most expensive in Europe is cheaper to attend than most of those in US - although that’s just a guess."

Damnthatsinteresting,feech77,t1_fedly71,1579030913.0,But you still pay more in tax towards public healthcare than us.

Damnthatsinteresting,fee9kgt,t1_feddk9v,1579029212.0,"The big difference, that the US will never fix, is that in the UK hospitals are owned by the state, doctors/nurses are employed by the state, and drug costs are negotiated centrally.  The NHS. 

US healthcare is capitalist in the sense that all services are provided privately, even if they are paid for publicly. This, together with the litigious nature of the US is a big part of why it’s so expensive."
Damnthatsinteresting,fedo6oh,t1_fedegai,1579016241.0,"Insurance is paying for someone else’s healthcare though - it’s not a savings scheme! It’s the mutualisation of risk, with someone making a profit for taking the risk that they get the price of the premiums wrong. 

And I bet that attitude quickly changes when a loved one is seriously ill and you can’t afford the treatment."

todayilearned,fdulyqz,t1_fdugflo,1578735049.0,"I was quite specific to the UK, but most of Europe is the same. And yes, obviously is costs money to treat people. 

Emergency care is free for all in UK. Only on hospital admittance is there a charge."

PublicFreakout,fdmmb0f,t1_fdmm3sk,1578555390.0,It’s also one of the reasons why a lot of things are more expensive in the US. Like health insurance  (not the only reason tho).

LegalAdviceUK,fdg8wi4,t3_el23hr,1578385036.0,"Aside from your legal rights, it is quite normal to pay back costs for professionals qualifications if you leave before a certain time period. Because of this, it is also fairly common for the next employer to pay for the cost of leaving your current role (assuming they want someone who is studying or with the qualification). I would wait to see if they will pay the cost before going down any other channel."

worldnews,fddax0i,t1_fdd2px1,1578303216.0,Don’t be naive. Quitting at Will is not the point. Having a mortgage and family to support and being sacked with no notice is what this protects against. Maybe when you’re older you will understand.

You are reading right wing scare stories regarding waiting lists. If someone needs urgent treatment they get it. If I turn up and an A&E department I am treated within a few hours, and immediately if life threatening.
