Anyway!  I stumbled across Jaromir Jagr and assumed it was Jaromir Jagr Jr. since Jagr is my age (at least) and all of the other hockey players in the pool were born in the 90s (sigh).  I saw him play when I was in high school and I am old woman now.  It's him!  The guy was still playing 2 years ago!  Ha!

She wouldn't get in trouble with her employers if she didn't let her in, the opposite in fact.  And it certainly isn't in Mrs. Kim's own best interests to let the old housekeeper in the house but she does it anyway.  !<That sort of keeps it from being a masterpiece to me.

It was terrifying to say the least.  Everyone was up and looking and shouting and crying and there was quite a bit of hubbub for several hours.  Finally morning comes and the kid wanders out of the trailer looking for some breakfast.  He had been in there the whole time, he had fallen between the bed and the fabric part of the trailer and had slept through everything and had no idea any one was looking for him even though people had been calling his name and had pulled all the covers off the bed and turned on all the lights etc.  So kids can get themselves into some weird places is what I am saying.

He was also the one who had any kind of relationship with Odin.  And two co conspirators both say he did it.  Even if Hernandez didn’t pull the trigger he was involved in the planning, did nothing to stop it, and covered up after.  All of that is enough to be found guilty of murder.

We signed up to do it because we wanted to help but it was untenable.  Having said that money would solve this issue.  Provide safe, affordable, supportive housing for everyone and you don't need Out of the Cold programs run by volunteers.  The burden shouldn't fall entirely to the city though.  We used to have a national housing policy and back then Canada was hailed as a world leader in dealing with homeless people.  People complaining about all of the homeless people around these days should ask themselves where they all came from.  They didn't fall from the sky.

Interesting.  Everyone on here speculating about Jennifer Lawrence and acting like she is the bad guy in the situation is quite eye opening.  I mean if this was a bunch of high school football players being coerced into performing sexual favours on the coach in order to be able to play I doubt any one would be saying ""well, they don't have to play football so they are just as bad as the coach since they went along with it!"" But maybe you would say that,"

It isn't a one-off.  *Every* girlfriend he has ever had has been under the age of 25 despite the fact that he is in his 40s. That does not speak well of his own maturity or his actual interest in these women as people.  I mean, if you are about to say ""how do you know those young women weren't all wonderful people?""  consider that women over the age of 25 are at least as likely to be wonderful people and yet he has never dated one.  Also, if they were all wonderful people with sparkling personalities why did he break up with them all?  Either way, it doesn't look good for him.  Hence people finding it creepy."
UpliftingNews,fdgxuvv,t1_fdgrvjs,1578410995.0,"I am not playing dumb.  A group of 20 friends from Soho would be unlikely to be all Christians.  The thing that would define them as a group would be that they are a group of friends from Soho which absolutely would be mentioned in any article about them travelling somewhere to prepare food for fire fighters.  The article would literally start with ""a group of 20 friends from Soho ...."".  If they were a church group that would be mentioned.  Again, any random group of 20 friends from Soho would also be unlikely to be all heterosexual unless they actively excluded others  so that would not be something that defines them (or if they are actively excluding others than it would definitely be mentioned ""anti-gay group travels to Victoria...."") and even if they were all heterosexual, heterosexuals are the majority of the population so that would not be worth identifying.  It would be like saying a group of right handed people.  Groups of people are defined by their unifying and distinct characteristics.  This group is all Muslim which is a characteristic that is both unifying and distinct from the population at large."
CasualConversation,fdgvsuq,t1_fdg90zx,1578409567.0,I think it is fine to ask someone to help you pack but I think the general understanding of asking someone to help you move on the day of the move means helping schlep furniture and boxes not packing which should be done before hand.

UpliftingNews,fdgrayb,t1_fdg8bwd,1578406290.0,"But this group did this charitable act as a group of Muslims, the same way a church might go and provide charity to a group of people so it is relevant to the story that they are Muslims.  And this is not the first time they have done this sort of thing.  When there were fires in Fort McMurry here in Canada  groups of Muslims, most of whom were new to the country got together and did things like have bake sales to raise money for the families who were displaced by the fires and prepare food for the fire fighters.  If a group of teenagers did that you would mention that a group of teenagers did it. If a group of elderly people did it you would mention that a group of elderly people did it, if a Girl Guide unit did it you would mention that they were Girl Guides, if a Mormon youth group did it you would mention that so why can't you mention that this group is Muslim?"

But when a politician says “urban youth are no better than animals” his racist followers hear “black youth are no better than animals”.  Someone who isn’t racist and is only casually familiar with the politician might only hear the actual meaning of those words but the politician knows what he is saying and his followers know what he is saying. Hence the term dog whistle.  Only dogs can hear a dog whistle, only racists can hear the racism in these sayings.  The politician can then plead innocence.  “What?  I just said urban!  That has nothing to do with race!”"
