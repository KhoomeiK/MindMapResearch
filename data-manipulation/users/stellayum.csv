bipolar,ffzr2jp,t1_ffzqq4r,1580390415.0,I have too lost a lot of friends which has lead me to not really trust a lot of people. I finally moved out of my shitty life back home and made huge changes in being more transparent with people which lead me to make some new pals who also have mood disorders. it’s crazy how just a little personal understanding of how hard it is to function with bipolar can go such a long way.
