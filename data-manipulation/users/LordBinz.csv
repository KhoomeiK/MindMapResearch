Saying you would walk away and ignore the consequences has very real effects for other human beings, and personally to me makes you an unethical person at the very least, guilty of failing to follow the golden rule: ""Do unto others as you would have done to you"".

BladeAndSorcery,ffd36ol,t1_ffd20ay,1579812516.0,"Yeah, I have used the Dark Chains mod but ended up turning it off as it made the game too easy, and also difficult to do regular grabs / telekenisis of weapons. Its really impressive but hard to resist just plucking peoples heads off whenever you feel like :P

Regarding head decaps, theres a perfect angle you can achieve but theres a lot of factors involved. The most important one is the angle of your blade, the edge needs to be angled correctly so you arent hitting with the flat of the blade. The sweet spot is at the start of the collarbone, and you want to ""scoop"" the head off with a crescent motion.

Certain weapons are far easier to dismember with, and others are practically impossible. Legs are the easiest to take off, then arms, then heads.

Also for your other question: To throw them with Dark Chains, once they are grabbed, you need to do this:

""Press trigger and the action button WITH BOTH HANDS to free all the chained parts from every NPC all at the same time.""

The  shorter your weapon and the harder you stab with it increases the chance of a stab and not a glancing hit. If you check out this video, you can see that its way easier to get a stab in slow mo, since your strength is effectively doubled and if you use the default 0.5 the threshold for successfully stabbing is much lower!"
