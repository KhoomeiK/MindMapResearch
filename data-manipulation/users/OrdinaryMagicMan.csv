TrueOffMyChest,ffhxmlj,t3_eth402,1579958352.0,"You are far from weak, you are just experiencing the troubling pains of adulthood. They suck. The responsibilities just seem to heap on and on, then with anxieties of navigating society and meeting people and handling  college and/or our careers it can feel overwhelming...and it is. You are not alone in feeling this way. Asking your father, or others, for help is normal and healthy. Normal adults survive by recognizing people they can trust, depend on and turning to those people when times are tough. You are not incapable, you are just growing up in a world that doesn’t always play fair and which is often unkind to dreamers and those of us who are overly sensitive and emotionally connected. It leads to us getting hurt but it also leads to great connections when they are made so be patient. Your Reddit friends are here to help. If you need to talk we are here to listen."
CrappyDesign,ffhsr8j,t3_etmoft,1579952003.0,Good old Alabama where the family bonds are strong.
toastme,ffgvbpg,t3_et5lla,1579915982.0,Especially kind of you to check in on all of us. Sending love and positivity back at ya.
toastme,ffd3kbw,t3_esz35x,1579812733.0,"The past doesn’t define us, but we can allow it to haunt us. You seem humble, emotionally aware, kind and are far from unattractive. These qualities are amazing for allowing you to shape a life which can be fulfilling and as beautiful as you want it to be. Please don’t be your own worse enemy by allowing old feelings of self doubt convince you that you are anything less than amazing!"
toastme,ffcyqzd,t3_esity6,1579810036.0,"Not being able to be with the girl you really like means you can open your attention to finding a new lady who CAN be with you.  Perhaps this is just the heartbreak before the love you were destined to find. You have kind, warm eyes so I’m sure they will melt someone’s heart soon enough. Best of luck to you!"
toastme,ff7qrjy,t3_eryahh,1579656079.0,Congrats on crushing that crush! It’s so wonderful to hear a Forever Alone becoming perhaps a Forever Happy. So happy for you!
aww,ff737tx,t3_es0vfr,1579640221.0,Sounds like the start to a Pixar movie.
toastme,ff6zxb4,t3_erm8iy,1579638335.0,We have all been there. We just want you to love yourself.
toastme,ff6z42a,t3_erjezm,1579637860.0,"Unfortunately people who are willing to give others their all and love with all their hearts put themselves in a position to have all of their heart hurt. I am so sorry that you are feeling this pain but remember how this feels. When you find someone who loves you the way you deserve to be loved you will appreciate it all that much more because you will realize how much their love truly lifted you. 

You are a beautiful lady with haunting eyes, which carry such a world of kindness within them. I’m absolutely positive that in time you will have someone who will thank their lucky stars that they can hold you close and hope they get the opportunity to show you how blessed they are be with you."
toastme,ff6upp8,t3_eryxfv,1579635268.0,I know it does not help right now but bad relationships now help you better avoid bad ones in the future. You learn what you are looking for in a partner and what you are not. And most importantly it helps you to appreciate the good one when it finally comes along. Be true to yourself and accept anything really worth having sometimes requires a lot of patience and effort to achieve. Hopefully you will come back here to update us soon about a new love! Best of luck to you!
