bipolar,ffg3l22,t1_ffg1ggw,1579897711.0,My mom's boxer will sit next to you and lean on you until he's in your lap.   The funniest part is that he ignores you and does his best to act like he doesn't know you're there.   Especially when you're complaining.  He'll stare directly in the opposite direction but continue to put all his weight on you.
bipolar,ffft54p,t1_fffne04,1579891234.0,"My grandma has a barn and as a kid, I started sneaking out there and feeding the stray cats that seeked refuge in it.   Over time, the cat colony got used to me and I started taming the kittens to give away.  We started trapping the adults to fix too because our barn cat colony got out of hand.   But I didn't have many toys and stuff growing up.  Just my animals and the outdoors.   My little arms where covered in scratches from catching scared kittens but I was determined to love them all!   I'd just go in the house and dump peroxide on them afterwords so I didn't get sick again and go about my day"
bipolar,fffo4vo,t1_fffn7tc,1579888144.0,I love boxers! They've got so much personality and sass to give with no concept of personal space whatsoever.

tifu,ff5t9xd,t1_ff5dwow,1579609413.0,Oof.  Serotonin syndrome is rough.   I've had it twice from prescribed medications.  I couldn't imagine getting it from meth and ecstasy...  mine pushed me into a manic episode and now I'm Bipolar.   All that Serotonin is REALLY BAD for your brain and mental health.  Hopefully you healed alright!
2meirl4meirl,feypucn,t3_epx8hk,1579448971.0,18 year old here.   Sobbing because I have mental disorders that keep landing me in the hospital when I only need 4 credits of online classes to graduate and it seems impossible because my life's a mess.  I have no license.  No job.  I'm codependent on toxic people and I'm completely and utterly stuck.   My only hope at this point is my boyfriend to get me out of my house because he's starting a stable job but that's if he'll put up with my shit much longer.    I'm desperate to go to college because I wanna get into social work or occupational therapy. Parents think it's too much work to file fasfa and I literally know nothing about their finances other than they suck and that would REALLY HELP ME.    Helping people is my passion but I can't even help myself.   Mostly because I feel selfish for even THINKING about myself and that's why I'm in this mess in the first place.   I'm about to write a autobiography of a doormat so I have SOMETHING to leave behind when I spend my whole life trying to get on my feet but amount to nothing anyway because I'm too nice.
