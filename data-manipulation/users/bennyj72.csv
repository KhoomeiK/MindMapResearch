alcoholism,ffno1w2,t3_eu9l95,1580068386.0,"Hey there. I was also not a huge AA person so I only went to a few meetings when I’ve attempted to quit in the past. A couple of resources I would recommend: 
This Naked Mind (book)
r/stopdrinking 

The latter is a great support group that I check in with regularly. Really helps to share and engage with other people who are trying to either get or stay sober. 

Congrats on making the commitment to stop drinking. Your life seems pretty good right now but it will only get better once alcohol is out of your life."
