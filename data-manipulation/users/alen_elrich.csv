bipolar,fepfdkf,t1_fepf2ow,1579319116.0,My doctor actually prescribed it for my depressive episodes because my manic ones are under control with geodon.
bipolar,fepf0gr,t1_fepe9lp,1579318861.0,How long did it take for you to feel and effect?
BeardedDragons,feiyl7r,t1_feiue4x,1579150859.0,I would try to figure out the situation. See if they received him in that quality and whether or not he is getting the proper nutrition and lighting.
bipolar,feitejo,t3_ep8xu6,1579146726.0,Smoking always gave me a lot of anxiety. I did it for a long time and I don't know why.

bipolar,fedmx2x,t1_fedd5ey,1579015424.0,I take ziprasidone now and I only sometimes have the restless feeling and it's bearable when I do. It does make me drowsy though.
bipolar,fecq5qt,t3_eog09i,1578980586.0,I've only taken abilify and it was terrible. Tired and restless at the same time is a miserable combination.
bipolar,fecprp2,t3_eobnvz,1578980239.0,If you're having these thoughts even when you're not high you need to go to the hospital and get treated ASAP.
bipolar,fecpij9,t1_fech00m,1578980013.0,I smoked myself absolutely crazy. I was delusional for weeks without realizing and my world just got more twisted and dark. All of my friends were talking about me behind my back in a secret group chat. Everyone was watching me. I had special powers that would let me communicate with people's subconscious mind. Looking back at it a year later it feels like a bad dream but it was very real to me at the time. OP please stop smoking. I've been where you're at and I've been even further down a path you don't want to follow. If there is anything I could do differently it would be to catch myself before I went into psychosis.
bipolar,fecdsc8,t3_eo8zkb,1578971524.0,I don't think it's that bad of a reaction. Just because we're bipolar doesn't mean we deserve free passes to act super crazy or be mean to people. It starts with trying to find the right medicine.
bipolar,fec7ucl,t3_eobnvz,1578968158.0,I've been in weed induced psychosis. Stop while you're ahead please. It can turn into an absolute shitshow that doesn't end when the thc wears off.
bipolar,fe5shql,t1_fe5qee3,1578873970.0,Yeah it definitely does. Sleepy and restless. It's a weird combo.
bipolar,fe5oomj,t1_fe2nufb,1578872301.0,I take 20mg twice a day. I don't always eat much with it. Sometimes I'll just take it with a large glass of milk. It doesn't do much without something though.
bipolar,fe06m69,t3_enhws3,1578804387.0,I take geodon and it helps tremendously with delusional thought patterns or negative thoughts in general. Not too many side effects aside from drowsiness
bipolar,fdzhxk0,t3_eng9ha,1578790365.0,Looks delicious. Om nom nom
bipolar,fdoj0sl,t3_em7qwf,1578606126.0,There are bipolar people who have been very influential in the world and create great pieces of art. Have you heard My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy?
bipolar,fdob5tv,t1_fdnzwfv,1578602020.0,You might look into upwork.com as well. I'm doing a contract project for a company through them.
bipolar,fdoamju,t1_fdnzwfv,1578601757.0,"I use Python, Power BI and SQL. Maybe you could work on some personal data analysis projects or try something new like machine learning or a data visualization tool. I think taking a class is still a good option to get some relevant and recent experience. A lot of them are interactive and can help build your portfolio. You could also talk with the career services at your graduate or undergraduate school to see if they have any ideas."
bipolar,fdnnpwx,t1_fdnmb0m,1578589581.0,What's your field?
bipolar,fdnlcaq,t1_fdmyid6,1578588202.0,I wish there was good medicine for anxiety. I'm not trying to get into benzos.
bipolar,fdnl6qt,t1_fdn7rde,1578588112.0,At my last job my manager was really supportive and appreciated me but it was a small company and I was being paid a lot less.
bipolar,fdmnk4c,t1_fddium4,1578556896.0,Does it make you anxious?
bipolar,fdmmvfk,t1_fdmmnq8,1578556057.0,I honestly can't say. I know on doctor on demand they have licensed psychiatrists. I would use it because ive been on the same medication for awhile so I just need refills. If you're in a bad spot id say it's better than going all that time without anything.
bipolar,fdmlaua,t1_fdi9n7o,1578554213.0,Ehh I sweat like crazy in certain situations so that's probably what is keeping the weight off
bipolar,fdmkm7c,t3_em458a,1578553430.0,Coffee will be your friend. I've been on an AP for more than a year now and they can be very sedating. In my experience the medicine works better with time. Your brain gets used to having it's imbalances balanced and you get less drowsy as time goes by.
bipolar,fdmk49e,t3_em4amv,1578552868.0,My last manager would berate me everytime we had our biweekly one on one. She even told me she knew I couldn't enjoy my job with how much criticism she was giving me. I told her I would find a new job that meeting.
bipolar,fdmjc7o,t3_em56h3,1578552005.0,I would start volunteering and taking some classes in your field to add in some recent stuff.
bipolar,fdmj0w5,t3_em2r4a,1578551672.0,I have thoughts like this if I'm not on ziprasidone. I  was in complete psychosis in a hospital for about 4 days and I was put on olanzapine and then switched to abilify and then ziprasidone. I'm on the lowest dose now and I don't think I have any delusional thoughts. I quit taking it for a couple days to see what would happen and I started thinking people were speaking completely in subconscious metaphores which was my primary delusion. I would talk to your psychiatrist about it before it gets worse and don't smoke any weed or any other psychoactive drugs.
bipolar,fdmi2q2,t3_em0hgo,1578550670.0,I just lost my job and I'm in a similar situation where my girlfriend is at work while I'm forcing myself to get out of bed. I think it's important that we stay focused and not take things for granted. I can't have a new job instantly but I can do things around the house like laundry and dishes or prepare dinner to show that I'm trying to pull my weight.
bipolar,fdmgynq,t3_em4e5u,1578549554.0,You might try doctor on demand. I'm not sure if your insurance covers it but they have good availability.i haven't tried it myself but I might soon.
bipolar,fdi0gpm,t1_fdhmmrt,1578433527.0,I did and gained a little weight but I have a high metabolism. I didn't know if you were experiencing weight gain from eating more or if the medicine slowed your metabolism or something.
bipolar,fdh52dx,t1_fdgylzi,1578415547.0,I didn't gain weight on any of them I just had a lot of cravings on the olanzapine and abilify
bipolar,fdg4s4o,t1_fdg4b1k,1578380003.0,I mean neither one of us knew what the fuck was going on so no harm done I suppose.
bipolar,fdg488b,t3_el0prq,1578379395.0,My mom brought me to my great grandmothers house who has dementia after I was in deep deep psychosis. Neither one of us could hardly talk. I still don't know what the point of that was.
bipolar,fdg3lav,t3_el53yy,1578378718.0,I switched from abilify to generic geodon and never looked back. I would naturally just starve to death so I like that it helps with my appetite. I had the munchies on abilify and olanzapine though ohh boy. I kind of miss those days when all I did was sleep and eat
bipolar,fdg3dnf,t3_ekwp8v,1578378501.0,Are you having side effects that you don't like or something?
bipolar,fdg2yio,t3_ekz0vx,1578378068.0,Will is one of the chillest people in the show. He's all about standing up for animal rights. I would totally go batshit crazy in a glass box with no meds. I didn't like watching him go crazy in the box. It actually hit a little too close to home but I don't think it's a bad portrayal unfortunately. He's super cool on his black market Canadian medication though which is a good thing.
bipolar,fdf287s,t1_fdezcfr,1578351637.0,Stiffness is really the only side effect. It makes me feel bored. I guess that's what not being manic is like though.
bipolar,fdakqq7,t1_fd9dlh4,1578247150.0,"Olanzapine, abilify and now Geodon. Geodon isn't too bad because I've worked my way down to the lowest dose."
bipolar,fd6errh,t3_ek5uwo,1578189873.0,I haven't been on an AP that wasn't soul sucking
bipolar,fd6dg51,t3_ek4209,1578189284.0,My professors gave me a lot of leeway with my disability. It made my last semester much easier. I was switching between heavy APs so I needed everything I could get.
bipolar,fd6bsg4,t3_ek4ng2,1578188564.0,I can really relate to this artwork. It's hard to explain in words to people how I feel sometimes but this does it perfect justice.
bipolar,fd6bgcl,t3_ek4fgn,1578188419.0,I think most of the people I knew in college really struggled in Computer Science and Business and they were healthy. I think you're doing a great job and youre in a great field.
bipolar,fd5qo7m,t3_ek2ktc,1578180400.0,"You gotta get some sleep my friend. It's very important for your mental health. My concoction is zyquil, melatonin bath, play thunder storm noises and taking deep breathes while trying to sleep."
bipolar,fccfnx1,t1_fc9enj3,1577597849.0,My legs still do their own thing sometimes I've just gotten used to it. They bounce more when I'm in social situations. I'm just a bit detached from what my legs are doing for the most part. I've been on medication that makes me restless for more than a year so maybe just give it time or switch to something different. I'm medicated to deal with manic symptoms primarily.
bipolar,fc9fzjt,t1_fc8agyv,1577552121.0,Thanks. I was questioning my spelling
bipolar,fc80kfh,t3_egjifa,1577523641.0,Are you still on those meds?
