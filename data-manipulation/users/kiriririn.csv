PS4,feasoj3,t1_fdrd2nf,1578951886.0,"I thought ending 1 was just what you described. I was blown away by it. Ending 2 was far less impressive than ending 1. And ending 3 was just underwhelming.

What they did with 9S was D E P L O R A B L E. He's a machine of logic and reason. So if A2 fixed him, he would have seen the big picture and understood why everything needed to happen, and he would not have had the ending he had. 

Very disappointed in the 3rd ending and it was SOO fucking easy. Like, 0 struggle. Ending of the game should be hard."
aww,fearyff,t1_feapujd,1578951705.0,"Yes, it is a carbon copy. Just because the delivery is poor, doesn't make it a different category of humor. They literally make fun of anything and everything: Down Syndrome, Tourette Syndrome, Depression, Anxiety, Religion, AIDs, fucking Timmy and Jimmy lol dude, it's a carbon-fucking-copy of South Park humor.

But since it's been beaten to a pulp by South Park, and since no one does it better than them, everyone gets triggered when someone tries to do it themselves. If what was described above was actually a South Park character, all of you would be eating that shit up along with me and the rest of their viewers."

I'm really speaking from the heart here. I may still need lots of work for real time interactions and submitting words without truly considering them. 

Whether or not I think she's good, she's still an artist. She's exposing her vulnerable self to the world, which takes tremendous courage. That's something I have to learn to respect if I even dream of finding fulfillment and reward as her fellow artist.

Did you know that the managers who have an ""ear for mysic"" that find talented artists rarely if ever release their own albums? It's not that hard to tell the difference between a very talented vocalist and a very okay vocalist. 

The person in question is very much so reflective of the latter. She's not that great.

Florence is great.
Aretha Franklin is great.
Christina Aguilera is an incredible vocalist.

Lizzo is not."
