Any health benefits from vegetarianism will take time. Some people even put weight on if they focus too much on pasta and cheese in lieu of the meat they used to eat, so just make sure you're focusing on getting lots of veggies, lots of fruit, legumes, beans etc. 

Try to use your new diet as an inspiration to make improvements in your overall health - go to the gym, go for a hike or bike ride, whatever it is to help you make a wholesale improvement to your life. The benefits will come."
vegetarian,fefsyad,t3_eowrmq,1579064253.0,"I mean...it seems like you're throwing a lot at your body by doing vegetarian keto and OMAD. No wonder you're struggling. GOOD carbs are fine, you just stick with things like lentils, buckwheat, beans, brown rice, wholegrain/pulse pasta. It's those refined, simple carbs that are the problem. Carbs aren't your enemy, but i can understand that mindset if you're currently on keto.

You can 100% get enough protein and everything else your body needs by being vego or vegan, it's just about eating the right foods and getting balance across those meals. Balanced diet, regular exercise and you'll be fine. 

Also, are you sure you bought a protein powder and not some other supplement? Generally vegan proteins are slightly lower in protein per serve, but still roughly 20-25 grams per serve is standard."

If it helps, the older you get the less you care about what other people (well, at least strangers) think of you. It's liberating"

Advice,fefii43,t1_feeiwvq,1579057024.0,"When you mention it to her, it's fine to bring up how it's affecting you and your sleep, but also stress that you want her to seek treatment because you're concerned about her well being most of all. It won't come off as accusatory that way.

Sleep apnea is no joke, and she should be seeking treatment for herself. The fact that she's dragging you down with her and affecting your physical and mental health is not at all fair."
