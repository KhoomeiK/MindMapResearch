It's taken me a very long time to learn this: it's not selfish to feel horrible and need help. You know on airplanes when they tell you that you're supposed to put the oxygen mask on yourself first? Sometimes you have to do that on the ground too. Please make yourself your first and highest priority. You are so worth it!! I'm so glad you posted, because otherwise we might never have cybermet. Take good care of yourself."

MomForAMinute,ff8mzlm,t3_es9p8b,1579686650.0,"It's not good to stay up past the point of exhaustion. Try a calming trick. Lay down as if you're going to bed. Take a few calming breaths, concentrate on getting your breathing even. Think of yourself as an airplane flying high up in the sky. Now get control of the airplane and start to bring it down into the airport very slowly, very gradually. Keep breathing and concentrating on a smooth landing.  It should help. 
Leave a light on if it makes you feel safer. Wet a washcloth and put it over your eyes. Warm or cold, whatever feels better. You will get through this, I promise."
insaneparents,ff8me20,t1_ff7qu3d,1579685721.0,I take a 5000 iu supplement daily. My blood test showed almost nonexistent Vit D so I'm just gonna keep taking it. Not gonna mess around when it's such a simple thing to do.

offmychest,ff8kxlk,t1_ff8kmq6,1579683479.0,Sometimes it just doesn't matter how much you love someone. I'm sorry.
offmychest,ff8kubs,t3_es97ll,1579683341.0,"Please please please go see your doctor and tell him/her exactly what you just said here. That's the first step. It's nearly impossible to see a light at the end of the tunnel when you're so deep in the tunnel, but it is there. Keep going and you will reach it. The light isn't a perfect life, because none of us has that. It doesn't exist. But the light is that one day when you're going about your day and all of the sudden you realize, hey, I'm happy today. But you have to take the first step. Just the first step."

offmychest,ff8kk0r,t1_ff8iqhk,1579682913.0,"I agree completely, except I think it'll be over very soon. This trial, anyway.  It infuriates me that this Orange Asshat has done things publicly that would have killed anyone else's political career virtually instantly! His ""I grab em by the pussy"" sound byte is one example. WTF!?!"
Whatcouldgowrong,ff8f1jk,t3_es7wyn,1579675696.0,I don't know whether to condemn or commend these evil geniuses.
PoliticalHumor,ff8ex32,t1_ff8et5q,1579675552.0,Please be wrong about him being the nominee. He is the definition of failure to launch.

DSPD,ff8cvoz,t3_err4fe,1579673300.0,"If I am not asleep between the hours of 6 am to 10 am, my day is shot and you might as well not bother talking to me because it won't be pretty if you do. Those are my CORE HOURS. Of course, I get more sleep than that, usually from 4am to noonish. But I absolutely require those core hours. They are sacred. It took me fifty years to tell everyone to eff off and don't call or knock until the afternoon. I no longer apologize for my sleep hours. Especially not to family (my brother and my now-ex-husband), who supposedly care the most about my well-being.  

Don't apologize or make excuses for what you need to function. Nobody else does."
DSPD,ff5d58c,t3_erbubj,1579587950.0,"I take melatonin every night almost two hours before I want to sleep. So I take it at midnight for a two am sleep time. That's about as much as I can shift my schedule. I get up about noontime.

Doesn't matter if I take it earlier. It does not act as a sleeping pill.  Good luck!"

I love that, and I love that you thought of something so quietly brilliant so thank you!"
AmItheAsshole,fex84e3,t1_fescm1d,1579426622.0,"That's an interesting bit about the karma and the votes. I'm pretty New, and I don't get it. I must confess that I was jealous of the massive number of votes on some posts, thinking they equated karma per vote. Yeah, I need to get a life!"
