RoastMe,ffmca8b,t3_etru16,1580052301.0,It’s impressive how you can look at both guys on each side of you at the same time
RoastMe,ffmc8lf,t3_eu051h,1580052273.0,Does your college not have showers in the dorms? Your hair looks like it hasn’t been washed since last semester.
RoastMe,ffmc27a,t3_eu37is,1580052158.0,Maybe you should get your heart going more often and stop skipping leg day. Not thriving any hearts with those twig legs!
Anemic,ffivdnf,t1_ffitt4g,1579983630.0,"I don’t feel like when I breath it does “enough”, like I could use more of my lungs. I’m a band director and musician, and it feels like I have to take more breaths when I’m playing trumpet or a wind instrument. I’m light headed a lot of the time if I play too much.

I’m definitely getting a second opinion on my results. My lab doesn’t flag your RBC as low until it’s below 4."
Anemic,ffi3284,t1_ffe6nju,1579963641.0,I will definitely look into this and talk to my doctor! Thank you!
Anemic,ff92uov,t3_es1t8o,1579703485.0,I struggle terribly with anemia AND exhaustion. They go hand in hand with one another.
depression,ff3y9cd,t3_erbhjy,1579551476.0,"I don’t ever very when I should. It’s never when I’m at the end of my rope, it is always over something stupid like not having a dog leash where I can find it in the house or running out of chocolate when I want something sweet.

It’s so weird how I can watch Greys Anatomy and sob over a patient dying, and then my husband and I get into a fight and I can’t cry when I feel like I should because I want to just crawl in a hole and die because of our fight."
depression,ff3xyij,t3_erb5ww,1579551289.0,I don’t really understand the karma thing on here to begin with...
depression,ff3w9mm,t1_ff3arst,1579550230.0,"Write down dates and when anything demeaning is said to you. Show a record of disrespect. If a coworker is late and NOT chewed out, write it and the time down as well."

memes,ff210fb,t3_er0roo,1579490914.0,"As a teacher, can confirm the accuracy of this. Even worse when there is also a needy and kind student who is just trying to ask you for help on something with the other two crazy kids turning your room into Jumanji any time you take your attention off of them for a millisecond."
depression,ff20lf5,t3_er6cig,1579490612.0,"I completely understand exactly what you’re saying. I’m so tired all the time, sleep is just never enough. It turns out I’m actually very anemic and have low B12 on top of my depression, though. Might be worth getting a blood test to see if it’s maybe more than just “in your head”."
depression,ff20gfr,t3_er4u6g,1579490510.0,"I’ve found that exercise helps, but I prefer to exercise at home and not for super long periods. I enjoy doing the goofy new game called Ring Fit Adventure on the Nintendo switch. I do maybe 10-15 minutes and get a sense of accomplishment for doing something good for myself, but I don’t feel awkward or uncomfortable like I would have at the gym."

depression,ff203mm,t3_er2c9d,1579490254.0,"Fuck I’m only 23 and already think life isn’t what I thought it would be. I thought being an adult would mean I’d feel fulfilled and that my job would leave me happy. Instead I’m constantly spoken down to for my age in the field I’m in, despite the fact that colleagues have the same background as me - a college degree and a state certification."
depression,ff1zwo2,t3_er2si8,1579490115.0,"I can 100% relate... I feel like an NPC for everybody else. Like, why am I not the main character? I’m just existing while others thrive."
Anemic,fetxq03,t1_fetot8f,1579381070.0,Thankfully my vitamin D is okay - I don’t think I can handle any more supplements. The iron is enough to hurt my stomach a bit!
Anemic,fetx36p,t1_fetlmks,1579380947.0,I eat a balanced diet and rake a daily multivitamin. I’m really not sure why that just isn’t enough to keep me healthy. It’s like my body won’t absorb the nutrients from actual foods.
Anemic,fetbzki,t1_fet9ick,1579373731.0,"I work long days as a teacher, and I thought my job was what kept me tired. As it turns out, you shouldn’t be low on breath and exhausted all the time!"
Anemic,fet8gp8,t1_fet57yy,1579372741.0,"It’s strange how the way we feel becomes a norm until one day you feel better and suddenly it’s like “wait, you’re not supposed to be exhausted all the time?”."
Anemic,fet064t,t1_fesz1j4,1579370593.0,"No, I eat a lot of vegetables, but also fish at least 4 nights a week."
depression,fdclbee,t3_eki346,1578277741.0,"I know school can be hard - I was there at one point. Try reaching out to a teacher? As a teacher now, I definitely attempt to connect with my students and make them comfortable to come to me if they have a problem of any sort."
CaregiverSupport,fd3i27r,t3_ejo2iq,1578158486.0,"So an update: my husband is insisting that I go into therapy for at least a little bit. I’m hesitant to spend that money on myself when we don’t know what his medical bills are going to be, but he’s not letting up.

Sleep was a little bit better last night. I only woke up maybe twice in a cold sweat, and I fell asleep before 1am.

I’m still struggling with my appetite. But I made some lentil soup that is a comfort food for me.

Two days with basically no issues for my husband health-wise, but I’m so afraid of being lulled into a sort of ease or comfort... because what if something happens?-"
