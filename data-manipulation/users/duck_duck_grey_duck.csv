Every so often the shows on TV would have specials of rural folks and their lives. These would be the people who live way up in the mountains. Think Deliverance type places but the Japanese equivalent. Great people, but isolated. 

Most of the time their Japanese is practically unintelligible for the hosts and the audiences and needs to include subtitles to understand them.
