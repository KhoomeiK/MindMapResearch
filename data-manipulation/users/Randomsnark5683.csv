TrippSnark,ffnwwf5,t1_ffnq92d,1580071803.0,"Bad news: Kobe's 13 year old daughter was on the helicopter too and was just announced dead. That's fucking heartbreaking, I feel for his wife and remaining children."

fatlogic,fe93zws,t3_eo4dl8,1578933956.0,"You wanna do research on this? Great! Just remember: correlation doesnt equal causation, you cant just cherry pick data to prove your point, and if your only study to back the claim that ""diets don't work"" is the one where people with binge eating disorders were given diet plans and sent on their way: good luck getting published in any reputable journals. That study was done in the 1950's so have fun getting laughed out of the room because you came to a false conclusion about a 70 year old study."
