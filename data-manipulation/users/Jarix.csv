todayilearned,ff8mgbu,t1_ff8loap,1579685820.0,"Possibly entrenched traditions and the obvious corruption in the us political arena 

I seem to recall shock from various Europeans that lobbying is legal. And it's not hard to see the effect money has on politics. Especially these days with things like citizens united. 

It amazes me that George bush senior by today's standards is a centrist. 

But that's politics and money they go hand in hand but it has been my experience that in America nothing speaks louder than the corporation. And if you look at things like Martin shkrelli those who control those corporations are so far removed from the people they effect they are sociopathic.

Look at the rising trend of massive price hikes to old ass medicines that are crucial to a non insignificant amount of people's very survival. Such as epinephrin or insulin. Because the us health system does what it was designed to by American philosophy of profit is always the best outcome. And more profit is more better. 

It's sick but that is the world we live in and with how polarized today's world is in the US who knows what tomorrow will look like"

todayilearned,ff8k4rk,t1_ff8h9xh,1579682288.0,"I would offer that public healthcare is constantly under attack everywhere it exists by the capitalistic entities that exist in those countries. 

I'll admit to being somewhat cheeky with my response but is accurate in that capitalism is rampant throughout the USA. 

In the UK as per your example the difference is the absolute devastation that was world war2. Unless I am mistaken the NHS was created after the war was over because everyone could see and feel the horror and need for public health care.

The USA has never had that and the states are more like separate countries than parts of a whole. It's too different from one place to another and it's everyone for themselves but all of them together only against outside forces. 

Sorry if I'm rambling a bit I should probably go to sleep"

OutOfTheLoop,fe0a8vb,t3_engpz1,1578807537.0,"Answer: The world over the last 5 years has seen the public trust in public figures seem to have been betrayed, especially male role models from bill Cosby to Louis ck to Al franken to Kevin Spacey, to Neil Degrasse Tyson to Harvey Weinstein to Michael Jackson to the Catholic priesthood to the president of the united states. We have had the me too movement bring to light more people who have flown under the public awareness for their bad behavior and the public is holding them accountable in the realm of public opinion when not in a court of law. 

It seems the old adage is in effect, nature abhors a vacuum, and the public needs positive male role models in this current environment that seem to exhibit the qualities that we desire in positive male role models by today's standards.

As far as we know they are safe and trusted examples of that role model, and they also are widely known"

I don't expect to ever be in Iran but living in vancouver there lots of restaurants which feature a particular cultural cuisine.

The corruption of journalistic integrity has caused a lot of this misinformation to be easily accepted as the burden of proofing every article is beyond reasonable to the average person. Without trusted sources to confirm what you have heard about.

Combined with agents of chaos, for lack of a better term, intentionally trying to mislead people for personal pleasure or self benefit, or simple institutionalized biased opinion/tradition, it is easy for people to rely on personal relationships/tribalism to determine a correct course of action. 

I personally am angry at the perveyors of intentional misinformation but find it tragic when we'll intentioned people trying to do the best they can buy into such things as anti vaccination"
