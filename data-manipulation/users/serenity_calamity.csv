- ""I'm pro-choice but there should still be legal limits to how far along a pregnancy can be"" (Limiting how far along a pregnancy can be before having an abortion ultimately causes more harm and suffering, because the vast majority of abortions done in the third trimester the fetus is no longer viable or would love a short and painful life after birth, or the person who is pregnant's life is at risk. It is a lie that someone goes through a whole pregnancy and just 'changes their mind' on month 9. Most later terminations that aren't due to fetal anomaly or health concerns are due to limits to access to earlier abortions.)

- ""I'm pro-education, not pro-choice. People should be able to have an abortion but they should be educated about birth control and adoption and other options."" (DUH, this IS pro-choice. Pro-choice advocates are the ones fighting for full sexual education and free access to birth control and sexual health products and early no-barrier abortions, and all of the things that would ultimately REDUCE the number of abortions, unlike abstinence only sex ed and restricting access to birth control that the anti-abortion advocates do.)

I'm not saying this is the 'right' way to do it, this is just how my activism expresses itself.

I am also taking a pre diabetic medication, Ozempic, for weight loss (had one dose so far). I just started all of this, so can report back later with how it goes. My dietician is very positive that I can lose weight, given that I didn't GAIN weight on the last plan.

I ended up going off the Topamax and back to my old dose of Lamotrigine. 

However, I can't honestly say I wouldn't do it again. I learned a lot from it, namely that the lamotrigine is actually doing a lot more for me than I thought it was. I learned how sick I really am if I don't stay medicated. And I once again was reminded how amazing stability is when it comes back.

You don't sound like you are stable, if you are having suicidal thoughts or not doing well. It seems like the perfect time to try something new, in a controlled setting with professionals overseeing your progress.

bipolar,fdwx1ed,t3_en9l5a,1578763136.0,I miss it all the time but I don't miss the panic attacks I got with it or the depressive crash that comes after. I have accepted and embraced never being hypomanic again.
bipolar,fdnh8ns,t3_embd70,1578585757.0,"I would recommend documenting every time this comes up, with dates and times. If they find out you have Bipolar Disorder and you are subsequently fired, you have a real case of discrimination. Perhaps contact employment standards in your area.

I don't know what to say about dealing with it, because it is a really shitty situation. Is the job otherwise good? Are you considering leaving for alternate employment? 

Is there an HR department you can make a complaint to, or any anonymous way to complain?"
bipolar2,fdngvzp,t1_fdnfadh,1578585542.0,"Interesting, thanks for sharing. Most of those don't apply to me. I will read up more about it though."
bipolar2,fdnd562,t1_fdkve2u,1578583248.0,"Okay, so I went to sleep super early last night, took a seroquel so I could fall asleep that early. Woke up and had a huge glass of water with lemon. Had a second huge glass of water. Swung my arms and legs around a bit until my heart rate increased somewhat. Had a coffee BEFORE leaving the house. 

Overall, feeling a lot more alert and refreshed today! Hoping I can go to sleep early tonight too. I'm going to keep up with the lemon water and movement thing for sure."
AmItheAsshole,fdlyagu,t1_fdlthgq,1578535387.0,"I think this is ""nah"" since the sister isn't an asshole."
AmItheAsshole,fdlwyce,t3_em2kc7,1578534485.0,NTA They sound insufferable.
bipolar2,fdlvlef,t1_fdlvie3,1578533538.0,THEN AGAIN I only did checklists on my own. I will ask my psychiatrist anyways. Or at least mention it.
bipolar2,fdlvie3,t1_fdlvbyz,1578533478.0,Hahahahaha omg this is great. I feel the same way don't worry. I read and watch videos about mental health a lot and feel like I know everything... spoiler I totally don't.
bipolar2,fdlrhlf,t1_fdln6py,1578530756.0,I will ask my doctor! What would be the risk factors that might indicate either of those? (I will Google that question too)
bipolar2,fdlrh00,t1_fdlccsq,1578530745.0,Very likely. I'm probably still recovering from the depression episode I've been going through all fall from medication changes and such.
bipolar2,fdlra6c,t1_fdkx0a7,1578530614.0,"It covers 80% of most meds, 50% of my latuda (name brand meds), and 0% of the new med I will be taking or the potassium pills I have to take. I did the math, and I get back all but $66 dollars each month with no extra emergencies or issues, so it seems like a good investment to me. My medication without coverage is about $800 a month."
bipolar2,fdlr1pq,t1_fdkv430,1578530452.0,"No, I am almost positive I don't have ADHD. I have done the checklists and I don't score high for it at all."
Daylio,fdkusuo,t3_elwozq,1578511595.0,I don't actually know what premium does. I find I get enough data with the free app.
bipolar2,fdkuomi,t1_fdkual6,1578511524.0,Great idea!! My dad does lemon juice in water in the morning too. I need more exercise so I will definitely try this tomorrow
bipolar2,fdkugm8,t1_fdkqpwa,1578511395.0,"Haha that's awesome that talking about it is helping you realize what's going on. I had side effects when I first started lamotrigine but most went away at higher dose. I still have brain fog and trouble thinking of words and memory issues. Boo.

Edit: I don't drink caffeine after 4 pm. It is too strong!"
