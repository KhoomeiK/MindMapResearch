todayilearned,ffinbnz,t1_ffijw3d,1579977994.0,"They [changed the rules slightly](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2651764-nba-announces-changes-to-intentional-foul-rules) a few years ago, so that you couldn't do Hack-a-Shaq by (for example) shoving your target before the inbounds pass even happened. That's about it, in terms of things that might affect the strategy. 

The NBA projected (how?!) that this would lead to 45% fewer Hack-a-Shaq type fouls. Safe to say that number was pulled out of someone's ass. But it was already uncommon by the time they changed the rule, because people like Shaq who are bad enough at FT to make it viable, but so valuable they won't be pulled late, are extremely rare.

If the NBA truly wanted to cut down on strategic fouls late in the game, they'd drastically change the timing or the bonus rules or the number of free throws, etc. But they don't because this *is* basketball as everyone has come to understand it. It's either a blowout, or teams strategically fouling one another in the last few minutes. 

TL;DR: Hack-a-Shaq is still viable under the rules, as long as you have a legit Shaq to use it against."

Pursuant to the ""best interests of baseball"" clause, I'm impounding every dollar of revenue from every team until they've paid local and state governments back in full for the subsidies used to build or operate their stadiums.
