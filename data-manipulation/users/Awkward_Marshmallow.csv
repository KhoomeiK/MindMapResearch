AmItheAsshole,fgspvmg,t3_f09w7t,1581090100.0,"NTA in slightest... maybe if you just stated no, and didnt offer her to buy it out, she would understand it as a clear no, but now it might seem to her like unless she cash out the money, you are refusing to help her, and that might be painfull for her, because not only she cannot have another child, her sister refuse to help her unless there are money involved. But you do not own her anything. Just be clear and from now on say no, and admit that putting a prize on it was a untruthfull way of dealing with pressure from your sister.

If you want easy way out, you say that the eggs are no longer viable for implantation, or that something happend and keep them in secret for yourself, once you decide to get pregnant again, and say you did it in natural way like first time, because it is nobodys bussines what you do with your eggs.  They should not shame you into share your dna material with her...it just morally it is wrong and you should be never pressured into something like that.

Also you never know how much eggs, you could have need in case of your another wanted pregnancy (as far as I know they usually put at least 3-5 viable ones in for 1 IV), and I cannot imagine you wanting to have another child and not being to able to have it, just because she wants one (also if her uterus is not ok the eggs might not even catch up... there are just so many variables) ... if she really want to raise another child and cant have her own, adoption is great option and really should be downlooked at, it is not your responsibility"

ukulele,fgs8b7c,t3_ezb2ar,1581076175.0,"You might need to strenghten your fingers and some of the chords just feeels awkward at the begining. Dont be too hard on yourself with learning. I got uku year ago and I literally went around for months at the begining proudly announcing that I can play as mayn as 3 chords... now Im at the state where I can play most pop songs under 2 hours if I got the chords from internet, working of figuring out songs by ear... really just keep practicing a bit every here and there, maybe make it a habit and part of your rutine and soon you will not even notice and you will play so much smoother and better (I always play to my cats before play time)

Also little advice great song for me to to learn basic chords progression is Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen, there is many C-G-C  and  F-Em switches that helped me be more courageous in the begining, good luck!"

curlyhair,fgqe9xd,t1_fgq8dcq,1581022506.0,Thanks... I guess it is too controversial to say someone would look better without digital enhancements ... which itself says enough
curlyhair,fgpwd60,t1_fgpt3br,1581013276.0,I agree I maybe should have used more subtle example ... I didnt even see all the comments you mentioned and I agree some are very wrong. I will find some better example and edit it. I really didn't try to abuse anyone and I am sorry if it came across that way. But I think it is important to talk about how tuning yourself to please others shape perception of your own self
curlyhair,fgpftsy,t3_ezsjvn,1581003956.0,"Your hair looks shinier than my expesive kind of glasses, great job!    
But could I also say something a bit controversial, and please dont take it personal. But maybe try stop editing your skin so much? There is absolutely nothing wrong with having skin texture and few blemishes here and there. It makes you more human, more lifelike and actually in my eyes much more pleasant to look at... just like wavy hair makes you original and true you, so does your skin.

I really dont mean it as a hatefull comment, exactly the oposite, you DO have really cute face and I love colour and texture of your hair, you have adorable smile, but the blur on the face just kicked me in the eye and distracted me from your actually nice features. I honestly think you would look even better without it... You know maybe think about that girl, that looks similiar like you, is few years younger will look at your pics, and her brain will say, you have to be airbrushed to have value... 

So what Im trying to say, can we please just stop the vicious circle of chasing unattainable perfection? 

Please this is really not any hate on you, I do not know you, it is just a small plea Im trying to share between women that I think really dont need the extensive editing to be beautiful... in the end do what you want of course, its your picture and you dont own anyone anything, especially not me, but honestly doesnt it feel great to see pictures like [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/BmW6jWCHxN6/?igshid=bpswds5ot5j) with reallife looking skin in it?

So i usually snack cucumber cubes or crunching some carrots and herbal tea is also great to give you sense of taste without filling you up with calories. 

As someone pointed out grapes and nuts are not good snack unless you are ravenous and need the energy ( sometimes I munch on few nuts when I have long meetings before lunch and dont want my stomach to introduce itself to everyone in the room) just search some low calorie high fiber food, but I hear you struggle is real with this, and honestly it is about being mindful of our actions and their results, and sometimes have a cake or cookie they are not enemy, food is fuel, so if you overfuel just make sure to increase your moving for few days and you will be fine"
