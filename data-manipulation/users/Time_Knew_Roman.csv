SolidWorks,feh08nw,t1_fegwod0,1579106417.0,Right.  My kid is about to get his 100th win and this would make a perfect key chain for his backpack.
SolidWorks,fegplvr,t3_eowfj7,1579099534.0,Can you throw this on GrabCad?

You should also have a med kit readily available.  Mine includes tape, gauze, stretchy medical wrap, Vaseline, triple antibiotic ointment, saline, scissors and tweezers."
tippytaps,fdk2zkg,t1_fdjudcq,1578494799.0,"Natural predator/ pray relationships live in a balance...for the most part.  Most people are are aware that coyotes hunt and kill live viable rabbits, and are not arguing against it.  These dynamics have likely existed for thousands of years and need very little human intervention.

Some of the argument and new information being propagated is against large scale factory farming.  These farms require giant swathes of land that completely snuff out all ecological balance.  Additionally, the abuse that the animals within the farm endure has gone far beyond anything covered in a nature documentary."
tippytaps,fdjvieo,t1_fdjupmh,1578488875.0,"Alright, but don't lump us all in together.  Keeping it at two sided argument negates some of the gray areas where all perspectives can come to an agreement and make actual progress."
tippytaps,fdjujj3,t1_fdjrtvr,1578487963.0,"This is a pretty narrow perspective on a very broad point of view.  Personally, my protest is against the habitat lost to factory farming and a little about animal cruelty."
tippytaps,fdhnie8,t1_fdhafjh,1578426395.0,"Unless you live in a impoverished area of the world, there is only upside to not participating in chewing the muscles off from these dead critters.  For your health, the health of natural habitats and the health of the planet...give it up."

Rochester,fcl5ak4,t1_fcl3bjg,1577740118.0,I'm pretty sure 'teach your buddy to drive stick' happens most weekdays between 5-6p on the 490.  'Teach your dog to drive stick' if there is a slight drizzle.
apexlegends,fckwdvo,t1_fckto9d,1577734628.0,That ult charge up sound they make would be terrifying.
Huntingdogs,fbb9ldd,t3_ecg3vo,1576695874.0,"My dog has caught a handful of rats in my back lawn.  I talked to his vet about it and his largest concern was the potential for rat poisoning in the rats blood, followed by infections from bites."
