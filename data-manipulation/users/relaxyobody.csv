bipolar2,fdkfq0n,t1_fdkfb6b,1578502904.0,Yeah that's probably it. I personally would rather die 20 years earlier and have lived my life medicated than to live 20 years longer in bipolar hell.

bipolar2,fdk9yvf,t1_fdk09xq,1578499409.0,"Your next goal in life should be to get a psychiatrist and to get on a medication that works for you! Trust me - it's like being lifted from hell into heaven. Even if you don't have insurance, a psychiatrist appointment is $100-$200 (which is nothing compared to the relief you'll be gaining from it) and $30 a month for my prescriptions (without insurance.)"
bipolar2,fdk8947,t1_fdjohio,1578498327.0,"I used to take lithium orotate before I was prescribed lithium carbonate and honestly I think it did help calm me down. I also distinctively remember me having suicidal thoughts still while on lithium orotate, so I would highly recommend switching psychiatrists and getting one that believes in medication. My psychiatrist himself suffered with depression and has been on Zoloft for 30 years. Hearing his side of things and realizing that he's lived a totally non-depressed life thanks to the Zoloft helped made me realize that this is the right path to take for myself."
bipolar2,fdk7qy2,t1_fdjw15i,1578498004.0,"Why are you scared to take it? Honestly with the hell I used to be in, any side effects were worth the potential benefits of feeling normal again. Please give it a shot, it can change your life as it did mine."

You'll be able to socialize with people without intrusive thoughts, you'll be able to go about your day without any kind of distressing thoughts. It's a night and day difference from your previous life, you're going to be a better person in every way possible. I wish you the best, and I'm sorry you had to experience bipolar 2 without medication."
