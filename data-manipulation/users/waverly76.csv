running,fe33toz,t3_enp983,1578845630.0,"Go to a running store.  Not a sporting goods store.  A running store.  

Ask to be fitted.  They should be able to analyze your gait and recommend shoes based on your feet and footfall. If they have a little track or treadmill in the store, use it. 

Try on lots of different brands.  Buy the ones that feel best.  Be prepared to spend over a hundred dollars.  

Have fun training!  Good luck."
