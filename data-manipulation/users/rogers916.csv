I just took my 3 year old up for his first time last weekend. He absolutely loved it, but it was hard to communicate much for him to do, and all he wanted to do was be held between my legs so I skied him down.  

That said, he just turned 3 in a December. If your 3 year old is a bit closer to 4 I'm guessing he is easier to instruct.

Any thing you have to offer would be great."

science,fezuqil,t1_fezs6c2,1579461912.0,"For one it can lead to worse dietary habits as you're tricking your body into thinking that it's has sugar. Later in the day your body will realize it didn't actually get the sugar hit you desired and will want more. This can lead to a lot of over eating of surgery substances.

There's happy other problems with it, but this is a simple one."

gaming,feowfi0,t1_feosxk3,1579306866.0,"I used to be a big COD fan, but haven't played in years. This didn't really used to be an issue because they switched themes. So even though it was basically the same concept and engine, playing MW vs WW2 was obviously very different. 

To add to this, increments on the same theme were 2 years apart because of the switching themes. So the changes were a little bigger."

The problem is, smartphones have destroyed my attention span. I find it hard to just sit there and do nothing. 

Gotta figure something out man."
