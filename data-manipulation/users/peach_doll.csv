introvert,fen48t4,t1_femxn32,1579276622.0,"For me it's about the connection as well, which is why I take it so seriously I think. There have been friends of mine (and I mean deep friendships where I was invited to spend time with them for fun multiple times or with whom I spoke to everyday for years) who have inevitably reached a point where I've reached out to them many times and they start to infrequently or never did the same back who, when we speak again, still call me their friend... but I no longer feel the same way. Like, they invest energy into the friendship for years and then randomly just lose interest and move on without any warning. Like, if we can go weeks and months not even thinking about each other or bothering to say ""Hi"" then there's no point in keeping up the charade.

Like, it takes very little for me to become a stranger again to people. I'm sure I'd even be awkward and uncomfortable around my own parents if given enough time apart so it's honestly just exhausting for me to invest at all in these kinds of relationships, even if I'm not investing much.

But I do very few things casually. I don't have or believe in having situational friends, it sounds... like something I really don't consider friendship at all. I'd consider those acquaintances or something... coworker, classmate, etc... but not friends."

TwoXChromosomes,fdd4zm9,t1_fdd11cg,1578295039.0,"It's a very traumatic experience, some people need time to process what happened. Then there's the added struggle of having to recall it and tell multiple people what happened and prolonging something that you didn't get a say in and didn't want in the first place.

It's also incredibly disruptive to your life... if you find comfort in the usual routine and just want to get back to it then that might be an added factor.

If it's family, someone you care about, or even if you're prone to shame and feeling guilty then the idea of ruining someone's life possibly by holding them accountable for what they did makes it even harder. Also the whole family may turn on you for reporting or it may tear apart the family finding out what a member of the family did to another.

Then there's the fear of judgement or possible retaliation, some people do victim blame and make reporting even harder. Then imagining there being a case that goes to court and having to go through it all again and possibly for nothing isn't really encouraging either.

A lot of people just want to move on or only find the courage to speak out when somebody else does first. It's a lot to handle emotionally, physically, and mentally and most people who experience something like this will never forget it."
childfree,fdc87eg,t1_fdbvliu,1578269002.0,"Eh... it's easier to judge when you have one half of the story. You may be seeing the end result but the actual events that happened while the parent was raising the child will stay a mystery to you more often than not.

There are also lovely people out there who are nice and polite who were terrible parents... we just never know.

... but yeah some children are horrible too. Not excusing parental abuse at all."
