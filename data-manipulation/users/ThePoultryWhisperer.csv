The most straightforward answer to your question is less existential: many Christians are bigots, homophobes, xenophobes, and ignorant on top of all of that. They push their beliefs on other people as well. Look at the pro-life movement.

I don’t hate any particular christian because of their loose association to other Christians, but the whole system supports and maintains some unbelievable opinions and perspectives. You choose to associate with groups of people who make socially irresponsible and unethical choices, which looks bad for you even if you don’t participate. Until the system isn’t setup to perpetuate hate, don’t expect people to see it positively.

The other thing you’re forgetting is that we don’t think your god or beliefs are special. It looks the same to us as any other religion because we have no emotional connection to it. From that perspective, you are judged by your actions and interactions just like everyone else. The stuff coming out of Christianity has a pungent stench, which, ironically, is how many Christians view Islam."

2) knocking before entering a bathroom is common courtesy especially if other people are in the house. Again, stupid and totally wrong.

3) feeling coldness depends on two things: awareness of the material and surface area. Wiping pudding on someone may not transfer enough to make the temperature obvious. I just tried this on my kids and they felt the wetness before the temperature. Further, I remember being knee deep in baby shit many times when my kids were younger and the temperature was never the first thing on my mind. I just asked my wife and sister for their opinions and both of them said the same things. Lastly, I have had hot oil drop on my hand while under a car and I didn’t notice until more than a few drops fell. The temperature difference of that is way higher than what would be happening in this video and it still wasn’t _immediately_ obvious.

4) this is basically a corollary to 3; not expecting shit to be wiped on you will result in a level of surprise that will overpower critical thinking. It’s the same effect as a very painful wound drowning out a less severe ache or pain.

ColoradoSprings,fezcb0o,t1_feypeke,1579455895.0,"I am confident the issue is much more than a hung service, which wouldn’t prevent things from “loading” as OP said unless it’s a system service. Either way, that is indicative of a systemic issue and there is no easy mechanism to restore it to a functional state. Of course, there are ways to do it, but why take the hard route that most likely won’t fix the underlying issue anyway?

It takes 15 minutes to format a computer, which will remove a ton of debug variables, and it has the ancillary benefit of removing the crap that has accumulated over the years as well. I don’t think it’s overkill at all; on the contrary, I spent the first few years fixing problems until I realized it was faster to simply format. These days, Windows can do it without any effort on your part, so I really see no reason to waste time debugging. Installing a few apps after the process finishes is better than trying to contend with an unknown set of drivers, malware, and who knows what else. Registry issues are another huge reason, but this is getting repetitive.

On rare occasions when a system allegedly can’t be formatted - according to the owner, I will image it to another drive and try the format anyway, which almost always works as expected. The person also typically ends up happier in the end due to the increase in speed. I’ve only ever encountered two systems at a personal residence that couldn’t be formatted and it was due to a custom piece of hardware. I ended up writing my own driver to replace the missing one because the original driver was causing the issue. Writing a driver for someone is beyond the scope of typical IT work and I wouldn’t normally do it, but the person was desperate and I had a few hours to get it done."

Frugal,fessws6,t3_eqc1mt,1579368695.0,"One of the hardest parts is digging the hole. You can do it yourself more easily than you may realize, though. After doing a few hours of research, rent an excavator from a local tool rental company and ask the delivery person for some tips. Call for utility locates before you do any substantial digging, of course.

You’ll need to deal with the excess dirt. Some places will take it for free if it’s good dirt, but plan on paying a dump truck to haul it away after you load it. Seriously, it’s much easier than you think. People often look at big machines and think they must be hard to operate, but that’s only true when you need to go fast and be efficient. I taught my 8 year old how to use an excavator and she was proficient within two hours.

As far as constructing the pool goes, your best bet would be to hire the lower level people who do it for a living without hiring their company. You can hire a roofer for $20/hour and get a whole roof installed for 70% less than it costs through a company. You obviously lose some things by going around a company that is licensed and insured, so you have to weigh that risk based on your situation. With that said, installing a pool doesn’t have as much risk as working on a roof during most of the construction activities. Make a construction plan and deal with each large piece independently.

Oh, one other thing - check with your county building and permitting office to see which permits you need. You can roll the dice and skip getting a permit, but it may cost you dearly in the end. I would not advise forgoing the official permit process.

A few high level pieces of advice for project management:
* Make a budget and be as specific as possible with every step.
* Add a category for unknown expenses and set it equal to 20% of the rest of the budget.
* Once the budget is done, add another 20% on top of that as overage.
* However long you think it will take, double it.

If you do all of those things, you will set yourself up for success by having real expectations."
