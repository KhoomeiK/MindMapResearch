The Republican establishment has been tearing into Hillary Clinton since the 1980s. She has been the right’s amoral, careerist, anti-family, left-wing elitist punching bag for damn-near 40 years now.

They don’t like that she kept her last name and hyphenated it instead, because a woman shouldn’t have her own ambitions, she should have her husband’s ambitions and shut up and support him. Then, when she supported him during his infidelity, she was painted as an opportunistic shrew for not sticking up for herself publicly. Then, when she ran for and won a senate seat in New York, she was lambasted as a failure of a politician for her failed Medicare reforms that the Republicans stonewalled while she was First Lady. Next she was ridiculed as Secretary of State, even though she had plenty of exposure to statecraft as First Lady and a Senator, because it seemed like Obama gave her a consolation prize after she lost the 2008 presidential primary. The rich keep failing upward, they said. Lastly, they were livid with Democratic messaging in 2016. Party officials and private citizens were publicly saying that it was “her turn.” The Right flipped out over that sentiment, ignoring the fact that she has damn near 40 years of experience in all of the areas where you would hope that a president would, because none of the experience was “legitimate” in their eyes.

politics,ffd1r3p,t1_ffcwmjg,1579811705.0,"Because you’re supposed to save in good times and spend in bad. That’s the driving philosophy that got us out of the Great Depression. Basically, use the federal government’s program spending and the federal reserve’s interest manipulation as a one-two punch to stabilize during economic downturns. You pay down your debt in good times to keep the options box full for when those downturns come.

At some point two things happened. Other countries started buying our debt to peg their currency to ours, and we realized that we could just vote to increase the debt ceiling instead of paying down the national debt. Both of those remove any practical repercussions for deficit spending except for one. A dump of US debt and a concerted effort to not trade with us. There were concerns that this would happen during the 2007 housing crisis, but in effect everyone doubled down instead.

It still could happen though. Our currency’s value is determined by how many people want to trade with us, and can count on us to keep our debts paid. If that changes, then we’re basically fucked for life. The benefit of paying off the national debt is to insulate us from this possibility, and the possibility that trade restrictions could hurt the value of the dollar.

books,fevuu8a,t3_eqg8wp,1579401804.0,"My relationship with my father is complicated as hell. He’s a bit of a sociopathic narcissist that is enabled by most of the people in his life. Emotionless, soulless father-knows-best shit that no one else gets close enough to see. Every time the world offers him an opportunity to grow, he attempts to entrench himself into his very narrow world view.

I see him in the father in The Road. Sure, he protects the child from external dangers effectively, but the walls that he puts up keep him and his son from relying on others and forming functional social relationships with others. There are others as well. “The Other” are painted as cannibals, brigands, and highwaymen for the first half, but once the son sets out on his own the first people he finds are kind people. They make sure that he keeps his “loaded” gun (at this point it’s filled with fake shells, but they don’t know that) so that he can defend himself from invaders. That is the act of a kind family unit who wants the son to survive and be strong. If the father didn’t die they never would have met.

Strong defenses and a stubborn refusal to process your emotions can turn any existence into one as bleak as “The Road.” Think about divorced dads and widowers taking care of emotionally functional, but existentially confused young children. That’s what “The Road” evoked for me."

FireEmblemThreeHouses,fes3ecs,t3_eqh5p2,1579360971.0,"In short: No.

Somewhat longer: this is the point of any Fire Emblem game with multiple class-up options. You’re going to have to figure out how you want to build each unit you recruit.


Here’s some advice:

1. Plan your classes out as soon as you possibly can. It’s best to waste as few training sessions as possible, so pick a Master level class for each character and work out what classes will get you the weapon and skill ranks you need to take the class. Plan backwards from the end.

Edit: Some characters are better off as advanced level classes and that’s fine. Swordmaster and Assassin are both perfectly fine endpoints for a build.

2. Play to a character’s strengths. There are little arrows on each character’s skills screen which tell you what a character is good and bad at. Now, you CAN train a character to be good at a skill that they have no aptitude for, but that’s generally a poor idea if you’re still unsure about how to make your units good, so just focus on obvious strengths for now.

3. Unlock Budding Talents early. Budding talents are the three-starred symbols on a skill. When unlocked by one-on-one instruction, these skills grant a new (sometimes unique or uniquely early) skill, and change their quality from a neutral or weak skill to a strong skill. For example, Marianne is a weaker magic user with high avoid with highly limited options if her Lance Budding Talent is locked away. Once she finishes her training and unlocks her full potential she becomes an excellent potential Falcon Knight or Holy Knight, as well as a Gremory. Her possible build options triple. This is what unlocking Budding Talents can do for you.

4. Itemize your characters to compliment their stats. Give the slow character who could never possibly double-hit a shield. Give the medium speed character who might double hit sometimes a weapon light enough to guarantee the double hit. Give units with high magic stats (like most of the Golden Deer) Levin Swords and Bolt Axes to use those high magic stats, even as physical attackers. This includes using battalions to boost stats."
