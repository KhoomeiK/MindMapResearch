I only bring this up because I've seen several peers, also with some learning disabilities, go through similar circumstances, delayed graduation/repeated grades, though they did not have parents like you that care this much (and most didn't graduate bc of that). 

It might be worth it to try and dig into how things were going there for him, without any stipulations on your part, and see if there's not a way you can talk him into at least trying to see his high school education through, one more time? 


He's at an age right now where he's part adult, part kid. Its not easy and he has new standards now he's expected to uphold, and you didn't do anything horrible by enforcing them this way (this is Florida and not Alaska, he left on his own accord) but I surely doubt you wish to continue with this tho because it clearly upsets you and isn't necessarily the only option here.

A foster child, girl??? C'mon. Your mom is extending her love and care to a child that needs it. This is important to both her and that kid. 

What the fuck you doin??? So what if this child is gone in a month, and I hope they're not if your family really cares for them, do you not take pride in being able to be born from a family and a mother who cares that much about other people, not her own blood, that you can't be prideful in a holiday family photo with this kid? 


Id be fucking PROUD to have that child in our family album. My sister was one of ""those kids"" though not so conventionally. There was no fostering. A woman literally just signed over guardianship to my mom, whom she'd never met, who was also a single parent (with me) and had issues of her own, because my mom saw a girl who needed HELP. She couldn't do the kinds of things your parents can (even considering paying for a yearly professional photo shoot is laughable to me in terms of money we didn't have) and she still got her back into high school so she could at least get her GED and be a real teenager for a few years.

She has mental health issues, obviously, and you've said you do too (I do as well, clinical depression is a cunt) and her issues are NOT your fault, she is an adult and needs to get her life together. Its not on you to constantly appease her and make sure she's ok. Its not. And no mother should ever tell their child those things no matter what the situation. She's likely freaking the fuck out about you not going ""thru a phase"" and can't accept that her SON is in charge of his own life. 

There may even be a bit of mourning on ber part, for the ""daughter"" she thought she was going to raise, but that's also NOT ON YOU. Can you empathize? Probably, sure. But that doesn't make you wrong for doing what makes you feel whole.

One person's living situation nightmare is another's normal day to day living. 

Everyone roommates differently. Communicate with your housemate and ask her if she'd like him to contribute. Offer food when he's cooking. Keep checking in with her. 

Is he respectful of the space? Does he clean up after himself? Does he treat your roommate as an authority EQUAL to you in the house? 

If yes to all those, why worry? Just make sure you uphold yourself to the same standards. And just out of curiosity, why are you worried, if she said it was fine? Because you'd be annoyed if the roles were reversed? 

Why would you be annoyed? If he was respectful and your roommate asked you how you felt about things? 

Think about that maybe a little bit and you might have a bit better of an idea as to what you're asking of her and why you're worried she's not being honest. 

You obviously don't want to upset her or disrespect her, so just take it day by day and try to give her space when you think your BF has been around too much."

People can talk about things and find solutions that work for them. If roommate isn't so bothered to answer honestly (if she was being dishonest by saying do your thing) then she should learn how to be honest with people and assert herself a little more. I had to. And it worked out, thankfully."

YOU can do drugs without all the socializing and fur lined leg warmers, sparkly eyeshadow and unicorn children's toys!

I wonder if they'd ever go after someone, let's say in this scenario, a crackhead named Maurice, for wearing Mickey Mouse ears 24/7 (including when he steals from Wal-Mart)?

Can a company sue someone for misrepresenting their brand in a scenario like that? 

Genuinely curious.

Like I did. 

House party 2013, I was working on getting shitty drunk and doing rather well, apparently. 


Both cheeks firmly within my grasp. .. but it was not my boyfriend's ass. 

I figured it out as soon as I felt the buns. These were not the buns I was looking for. 

And not only were they the wrong buns, but they were the only buns at that party my boyfriend would've explicitly NOT wanted me to grab- as they were my EX boyfriend's buns. 

We were friends at the time and they got along ok for what it's worth, but lord did I fuck up right there. 

They were both wearing similar clothing that night and ex was standing at the foosball table right where BF was standing before I went inside the house, so when I came back out, drunkenly looking for dem cheeks... Well. I missed and got the old cheeks instead. 


Woops. 

We all laughed. Except for boyfriend. He fake laughed. And then I got the laser eyes and knew I was hosed. 


We broke up of course but not because of that. It just helped things along lmao"
