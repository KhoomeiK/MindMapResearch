depression,ffetqup,t1_ffeb9b1,1579865118.0,"I just feel so hopeless. I went to an intake at a treatment center and they want me to do a second intake to break the news that insurance wont cover it but wont tell me anything over the phone. Plus they want me to fill out all this extra paperwork and I dont own a printer and I'm too scared to print out the forms at work so I have to wait til I have the time.to go to the library. I think they just want me to come in again so they can charge me again. I'll be talking to someone who wont even end up being my therapist. Plus they dont have an in house psychiatrist and wouldn't give me a referral to one at my 1st intake. 

Talking about my problems to a therapist wont get rid of my body aches, insomnia, and crying spells at inappropriate times. I'm just so tired. It's been this way for 8 months and I just want the pain to stop. The stress is making my ibs act up and I shit my pants at work yesterday. I've been asking for help from my gp and therapist for months and I've made no progress. 

I cant take off work for treatment without risking my job. I'm so stressed out."

Then i could still feel this way and be without a way to live. I cant take such a big risk. The only advice my doctor has is to go to IOP which isn't covered by insurance. My therapist doesnt know a psychiatrist to send me to. I keep asking for help but no one knows how to help.

Effexor,ffcgw33,t1_ff420m1,1579799197.0,Wow insulting me is really getting your point across in an effective way. I'm sure you also know that a decent chunk of depressed people dont enter remission no matter what meds they try. This may be a red flag something else is going on but considering how many people are treatment resistant think horses not zebras.
fatlogic,ffcckpk,t1_ffcakak,1579796533.0,Because people recovering from anorexia have trouble with reading their own hunger cues. Its telling them they dont have to wait until they feel like they are gonna pass out to earn the right to eat.

fatlogic,ffca3db,t1_ffbvw1e,1579794975.0,I lost weight once be I was on wellbutrin and got zero pleasure from food at all. I was still depressed but eating was a chore and everything tasted like cardboard. I'd finally eat when I got dizzy. Lost a bunch of weight really fast even though I wasn't trying bc I was too depressed to go on a diet. Now you know one person who lost weight without intention.

fatlogic,ffbsrgu,t1_ffbrg3s,1579781376.0,"I think bc weight is such a touchy subject personally I just dont comment unless I know them and how they would receive such a compliment. Otherwise their weight is none of my business. They are probably getting comments left and right anyway and frankly it gets tiresome. 

My coworker recently went on and on about a patients recent healthy weight loss and it was just over the top. ""Wow, you look great today! Love the outfit!"" is benign and just fine. But going on and on about it just crosses a line IMO."
fatlogic,ffbsgy1,t3_esqqw3,1579781041.0,"Last time I lost weight it was because of obsessive calorie counting and purging whenever I ate over my calorie limit. The compliments made me feel really uncomfortable. How did you do it they'd all ask. Oh, you know, just better choices. The comments that were along the lines of you look so good now made me think of how terrible I must've looked before. Plus when you lose a ton of weight the comments are unrelenting. I just got tired of people constantly commenting on my body. 

The key is here is just being polite. If you know someone is adapting healthier choices a compliment is warranted. If you barely know someone just keep your mouth shut.

When my mom was pregnant with me she had diabetes and became quite slim for being very pregnant. She got tired of all the compliments on her figure when in fact she was very sick and had to be hypervigilant about everything she ate so I would be ok."
Dentistry,ffbrjs9,t3_esrtoo,1579779950.0,"Put a shoutout on facebook asking for dentists your friends go to!  You can also ask coworkers. That might ease some of the anxiety about going in if you know others have had good experiences.

Effexor,ff5y8s1,t3_errxgc,1579614133.0,That should go away within a few weeks. In the meantime try those little heat packs for campers that when you crack em they heat up. As long as you fingers and toes  arent blue it's just uncomfortable.
depression,ff5w13l,t1_ff5r3js,1579612157.0,"Hours of crying uncontrollably or crying at inappropriate times is not at all fun. Its absolutely awful. It's also awful to feel numb. But objectivity when you cry at work, or have to leave social gatherings early bc you feel that you will soon need to sob for 6 hours sucks. Dont tell people who cry we are lucky."
fuckeatingdisorders,ff3z6i9,t1_ff3mq8q,1579552055.0,I'm not sure. I've never been to treatment before. Today was the intake and I dont really know what to expect. They only make you gain weight if you are underweight to low normal weight. If you are obese logic says they are gonna want you to lose weight.
EDAnonymous,ff3bvv6,t1_ff3b2e3,1579538113.0,Latuda was the worst! For some reason my psychiatrist through it would be great to prescribe a sedating med that's best taken at night to someone who purges dinner 3x a week.

Currently I have nexplanon and I love it! Took my periods from 7 full days down to 3-4. No side effects. No worrying about if I'm pregnant. I have anxiety and I always thought I was pregnant, even getting my period wasn't enough. Dont watch the show I Didnt Know I Was Pregnant!"
depression,ff2xy2z,t3_eravhk,1579528171.0,I hate when others want to process their emotions about my life and my depression with me. Sounds like your mom is not someone you can be honest with because she wants to make it all about her.

Effexor,ff2wi5x,t3_ercq3l,1579526787.0,"Taper very very slowly. Get a scale and start doing a 15% taper. Waiting until the withdrawal symptoms go away before you lower again. This will take months. I got off cymbalta only with also adding prozac. I tried to taper of the prozac but my anxiety was out of control so I stayed on a low dose for a few years. 

The brain zaps on it can happen if your insurance changes what manufacturer makes it. So if your pills change color one month it will be different. What dose are you on?"

The desire to throw up after eating is how my bulimia started. It took years before I actually purged with vomiting instead of fasting or compulsive exercise. 

It sounds like you have some pre bulimia and something physical going on. Could just be anxiety affecting your stomach but please see your doctor."

I'm angry I have to do everything myself without much professional help, despite my openness and practically begging for someone to take notice.

People on this sub are big fans of MAOIs and ect but even ect only has about a 51% effectiveness rate.

Iop is short for intensive outpatient program. I know my gp wants me to do it but I dont have any faith in therapy as it's never really helped much. At best it's a place for me to vent and at worst they completely invalidate my feelings and tell me I should be grateful I'm not bipolar. Or make me hold hands and pray with others. 

I feel stuck at my job. I'm too depressed to find another one and I've hardcore looked before and no one ever hired me. I'm pretty fat and ugly and in my field they want you to not only be good at your job but also look nice which I dont. I'm barely doing my job as it is and if I get fired I'll lose everything. In my field 99% of jobs are for small businesses so many laws that protect me dont apply.

I'm afraid she's gonna dismiss me as a patient and then I'll just be left all alone."
depressionregimens,feo6hub,t1_feo3mlm,1579295819.0,"I dont have a psychiatrist anymore. In fact my gp isn't even wanting to switch my meds bc she wants me to go to an IOP that my insurance wont cover. I'm just preparing. I wanted people's experiences so I could mentally prep myself for the next hell a med switch will put me through. I could always go back to a psychiatrist I saw twice but the receptionist isn't English proficient. He was the one who suggested I just cold turkey effexor and go to the emsam patch (which my insurance wont cover). I just need an rx from someone and my gp or gyno would give it to me. 

I cant even get a live person at my GPs office to tell me in my ankle is indeed broken or not. I've left 3 messages this week. I need to find a new GP. And probably get another xray bc I doubt I have access anymore to the one that was taken Monday. 

My therapist doesnt have any psychiatrists to refer me to. I was hoping eventually I could get an appointment with my current gp and just tell her what I want to try or find another doctor that would do the same. Psychiatrists dont seem to know what the hell they are doing anyway.

I finally got it xrayed 2 days ago and my doctor still hasn't gotten back to me on what to do.

Last friday I saw her and she recommended an IOP for me. It was after business hours by the time I was done so I called monday and they dont take my insurance. She says she wants a psychiatrist to mess with my meds but she doesnt have anyone to send me to. And the IOP wont take me. I called Monday and left a message bc no one answered the phone. I called again today to ask about my ankle and same thing. I've left messages both times. 

I guess I dont really wanna do IOP anyway. My friend recommended another program but its mainly for eating disorders. I'm in recovery from bulimia but only bc I'm too lazy to purge. I keep putting on weight and none of my clothes fit. I have an intake appointment next week but I dont think it's for me. Right now my depression is destroying my life not currently my ED. Plus I dont want to take off work bc I'm so embarrassed and I cant afford it. 

I cancelled appointments with my therapist. I'm not making any progress and I dont see the point in continuing to go. 

I think I'm stuck in this loop looking for a solution where there really isn't one. I just have to accept this is my life and try to survive for the sake of my loved ones. Maybe I'm too focused on what's next instead of being focused on the present. I could be way worse. I've been in worse places. I have a lot to be grateful for. I'm always wanting more and I just need to accept that things dont always need to be moving forward and that my life isn't that bad. 

I've been planning a vacation over summer w friends and I backed out. I wouldn't enjoy it.  Its really disappointing as it was going to multiple European countries. Planning it was just so overwhelming and kept making me worry about money and having the energy to actually go and not bring everyone down the whole time.

Or I could go in debt just to go through the embarrassment of needing time off and then just be exactly in the same place as I am now.

depressionregimens,fecxweg,t1_fecjwc2,1578989101.0,It stopped working. I'm a mess. I had some life things happen. All meds eventually crap out on me though.
depressionregimens,fec9ijp,t1_fec7u65,1578969054.0,Only a few months. I switched to abilify bc my insurance wouldn't cover rexulti.
EDAnonymous,fe9gaac,t3_eo444n,1578937252.0,I had a dream where a man publicly dumped me and then turned around to ask out my bff telling her how beautiful she is.

depression,fe62181,t1_fdz740l,1578880017.0,I never said I wanted cancer. I just want the attitudes toward depression to be as compassionate as they are for people suffer from cancer.
depression,fdvmb5m,t1_fdvgbfx,1578748973.0,Already on here I got told I just need to take a break and do something wholesome and volunteer. And I'm like I dont have the energy to shower daily? I work full time and I'm severely depressed so volunteering is pretty much out of the question. Just because other people have it worse doesnt mean that I'm not allowed to feel pain.
depression,fdtk4bn,t1_fdt9n3t,1578717912.0,"Money. Money is the reason I cant take a break . I only get 30 hours of vacation a year. I'm taking it in july. 

I dont have the energy to shower let alone volunteer. I also work 5 days a week. I'm too exhausted to do anything  but go to work, lay in bed, and socialize minimally. 

I'm doing everything I know how to do. I force myself to socialize even when it drains me and makes me feel worse. I keep in touch with friends and family. I take my meds. I pursue new medication options. I go to therapy. I even went to a 12 step program for eating disorders for two years. I never call off work bc I'd rather stay in bed. 

I see people that have it worse than me as well. Many medically compromised patients. I know I have it good and I'm wasting my health. I dont deserve it. 

I've been trying so hard. I just dont know what else to do but go to IOP and lose my job. 

I'm sorry about you dad. And your friend must be grieving terribly. That actually makes me feel like shit though bc from the outside anyone would love to trade places with me. I've had a good life. But I'm wasting it and wish someone would murder me. I wish I could die and give my kidneys to your dad. He has more to live for than I do. I have no future. 

I wish I could read. I find myself reading the same book for months bc I have to reread pages over and over again to remember. I'm not very smart anymore. Music feels empty. I dont enjoy anything. Even getting my nails done is a chore. You'd probably say I should be grateful to be so lucky to afford getting them done. 

In the end you are still invalidating my experience bc others have it worse."
depression,fdt7xyd,t1_fdsg7ar,1578713092.0,"Just because it could be worse doesnt mean it couldn't also be better. I can barely function. I cry constantly. I cry at work. I sob during my drive to and from work. I go to the top of the parking garage near work hoping to gain the courage to jump off. I dont want to live. I only hurt people who care about me. I cause pain wherever I go. I do not provide quality care to my patients. I deserve to be fired. I dont deserve what little I have. I sleep less than 6 hours a night for months on end. I slept 2 hours last night bc I couldn't stop crying. I cant do lau dry or shower enough. I know people would be better off without me. I literally cant enjoy anything. I even cry during sex. 

I guess I need to suck it up and just be more grateful. And realize I could be worse. Wow you are so helpful. I guess I just complain and focus on the negative too much. I should just pull myself up by my bootstraps and realize kids are starving in Africa. I do understand they have it worse. If I could trade places I would. I'm a waste of life and my depression is my fault. I get it. You arent telling me anything everyone in my life isn't already telling me. 

I dont know whether to be mad at you or admit you are right and I'm an ungrateful piece of shit."

depression,fds22iu,t1_fdry44c,1578693146.0,"I think I just want to not be so damned embarrassed for what I'm struggling with. People dont understand. They say eat better, exercise more, try to have a positive attitude! See? You just arent trying hard enough to get better. Life is hard for everyone. Suck it up. Every one gets sad and we still love life and function."
