wine,ffcp72t,t3_eswjro,1579804256.0,"Off of the top of my head, I think there's 2 (or maybe 3) general kinds of wine glass consumers: (1) non-wine enthusiast that just wants any glass or any glass that's a decent price and not ugly; (2) non-wine enthusiast that really only cares about aesthetics and not function; and (3) wine enthusiast who care about function more than anything (and can be very picky).  I think you need to hone in on your target market and make your glass more appealing and known to them.

If your glasses are functionally good/great, I'd give some out to wine shops, restaurants, etc. to try out, or advertise on wine enthusiast forums/websites with a bit of a discount to get people to try your glasses and hopefully then recommend them to others.  It's hard to sell unknown glasses to wine enthusiasts online, because they can' feel the glasses and it's very hard to tell if they'd like them.

If you're selling to non-wine enthusiasts, I think it comes down to more traditional marketing.  Sell at a good price (at least initially) and advertise.

It's just such a competitive space, and people either don't think there's much difference between one glass and the next or they do, but can't evaluate your glass properly online.  You need to go out of your way to inform your target market about your glasses and then incentivize them to try it out instead of on of the many other wine glasses.

Good luck!"

wine,ff9pwvx,t3_esc7ea,1579718326.0,"First, any reputable wine store that's worth going to regularly should stand behind their product.  If you buy a bottle and it's gone bad, the should give you credit or a replacement bottle (with the exception of auction bottles or very old bottles where they specify that the bottle is sold as is).  This alone should put you at ease.

Second, a lot of wines aren't even released by the winery until 2, 3, 4+ years after harvest (e.g., big red wines are usually released at least two years after harvest, Riojas, Barolos, etc.).  So, if you're buying a 3 year old vintage, it might have just been released.

Third, a good amount of reputable wine shops keep the store slightly cooler than room temp and/or have a large refrigerated area in the back for longer term storing, so the bottles will keep much longer.

Fourth, unless it was stored very horribly, a lot of less-than-ideal storage probably won't terribly affect the wine in the short term. So, if you're planning on buying a 5 year-old bottles from a wine shop and drinking it within a year or so, chances are it will be fine.  If you want to age a bottle for 20+ years, yes, it might be safer to purchase it ahead of time, right on release, or direct from the winery (or just from a trusted retail shop).

Anyway, I don't think you need to worry too much."

dogs,ff6s3qs,t3_eryrhw,1579633724.0,"After spending almost a year looking for a specific kind of rare breed dog with a specific temperament, we found a magical pup up for adoption.  He was in need of a good home and we couldn't pass him up, so we adopted him almost 2 months before we were leaving on our 3-week long honeymoon.  We felt bad about the timing and knew it was far from ideal, but we didn't think we could pass up this dog, and we thought it'd work out for the best in the long run.

He has a bite history (and bit his new step sister a few weeks before we had to leave.. and we were working with a behaviorist to fix that and we didn't want him regressing while we were gone), so we found someone with large breed experience and no other animals in the house to watch our guy while we were out of town (we put our girl with her usual sitter).  We missed him so much and felt bad, because we know he had a rough life and was getting really attached to us. When I picked him up, it actually took him about 3 - 5 seconds to recognize/remember me, but once he did, he was so happy and went nuts.

Anyway, it worked out just fine and he's a very happy boy today and everyday we are so grateful to have this dog in our lives (and we think he feels the same way).

TLDR: Less than 2 months after adopting a potentially difficult to manage and supervise dog, we left the country for 3 weeks and left him with a new dog sitter we found on Rover. We missed him a ton, but he was fine and we all live together very happily now.

If I see you advertising a wine I like at a good price on Facebook, but then go check out your website, I wouldn't buy from you because the very low quality of the website makes the operation seem suspect to me (plus, I don't know how to actually purchase from the website).

Now, I wouldn't be surprised if a shiny, top-tier e-commerce website is expensive and maybe not worth the money for you, but I'd still look at other wine store websites like JL Buckley, K&L, WineX, Woodland Hills Wine Company, FirstBottle Wines, Wine House (not even a great example, but it still works), Wine Library, Binny's, etc.  Sure, maybe you don't have the resources to get your website as polish as some of those, but see what you like as a consumer trying to purchase from those sites and try to replicate that to some extent on your site."

I have a 1995 Tokaji Aszú Essencia that I'm still holding on to because I think it's still improving.  Someone whom I drink with told me that he somewhat recently had a Riesling from 1919 and it was good.

Anyway, while I don't blame anyone for believing the common fallacy that whites are not made to be aged, there are A LOT of whites that are meant to age for several decades and some that will even out last you.  Look into Rieslings, white Burgundies, Sauternes, Tokajis, and Champagnes (including Blanc de Blancs) for some examples of extraordinarily age worthy wines."
wine,fengkb0,t3_eq3nbt,1579284223.0,"First, you need proper storage conditions to effectively and reliably age wine.  This generally means you have a dark place, that has a constantly cool temp (ideally 55 degrees), and ideally higher humidity (I believe 70%-80%, but this is a bit less important).  I wouldn't hold your breath if you're trying to age wine on a wine rack that's sitting in your living room.

In terms of what wines are age worthy, while a lot of your less expensive supermarket wines are not made to age (and rose typically isn't meant to age), you have a large selection of age worthy wines to choose from.  Typically, for suitable aging, you want a pretty balanced wine with higher amount of tannin, acid, and/or sugar, ideally, along with some strong primary (e.g., fruit) flavors (as these will fade over time).  Some wines will just soften and come together with some age, while some will really transform. 

Which wines to get depends on your tastes, as everyone likes different things.  Sure, big reds (e.g., Cabs, Syrah, Bordeaux blends, Rhone blends, etc.) often make for great aged wines, but you can also age many other kinds of wine like high quality Pinot and Chardonnay, vintage Champagne, dessert and fortified wines (e.g. Port), and, my favorite, Riesling.

Another thing to realize is that you might not necessarily like aged wine more than young, so try to go to a restaurant or look around at shops for some aged wine and see if you like it.

Anyway, IF you have the proper storage conditions and like aged wine (or want to wait many years and find out), go to a local wine shop, give them your budget (you can even get some very age worthy wines for $25-$30), tell them what you like, and ask them to recommend some bottles that should improve with some age.  Buy those bottles, taste them, and if you like them, or you like them but maybe they are a bit to intense or harsh (from tannin or acid), go back and buy some more for your collection."
wine,fenffmd,t1_fenf05l,1579283534.0,"Part of this is misleading and part of this is wrong. Some of the most age worthy wines are white. Also, while nearly all wine by volume/sales is meant to be drunk now or in the very near future, I think a lot, if not most, wines that are over a certain price point are often suitable for aging.  

Sure if you pick a bottle (or jug or box) at random from a grocery store, there's a good chance it's not suitable for aging, but if you spend even $25 at an actual wine shop, there's a good chance the wine will benefit from a few or more years of aging."

Dogs generally need to be introduced properly, especially when you're getting a new dog to live with you.  It's not uncommon for very sweet dogs to bite a new dog at some point, especially if not introduced properly (this can often take several weeks).  You combine that with the significant size disparity between the dogs, and you guys were pretty much playing with fire, even if unintentionally.

If the dog misbehaves, promptly put him in a separate room by himself, but let him out after just 2 - 3 of minutes.

Banjo is resource guarding you as he is worried that you and your affection is a limited resource that he can't let the new dog steal from him.  You have to teach him that there's plenty of you to go around and train the dogs to like each other.  When the dogs are by each other and by you and behaving well/fine, pet/praise/reward both of them (treats can work, but you should make sure they aren't food agressive or protective first).  If you are already petting dog 1 and dog 2 comes near NEVER stop petting dog 1 to pet dog 2.  Instead, pet dog 1 more vigorously/better and pet dog 1 with your other hand (one person can pet dog 1 and another person can pet dog 2).  Anyway, you want to associate being near each other (and not misbehaving) with rewards.  Do this consistently and they will like each other and not resource guard you."
wine,fe45k2c,t1_fdzesfk,1578856020.0,"Without posting all of my detailed notes, here are my (very unexpected) overall thoughts:

Very surprised and disappointed by this wine.  The thing that I disliked the most was the heat and the bitter note, presumably from the alcohol.  This was surprising.  Additionally, this wasn't as rich, complex, or balanced as expected.  I didn't really enjoy it, although, when I drank it more casually and paired with Roquefort, it was decent.  Good pairing with Roquefort.  

Maybe I'm unfairly comparing it to sweet Rieslings, and maybe my bottle was off, but I wouldn't buy this again.

79 pts (for me 70 - 79 is pretty bad/lacking; 80 - 83 is average/mediocre; 84 - 87 is good; etc.)

My wife thought it was mediocre and scored it 83 points.

dogs,fdynqb4,t3_endotc,1578781783.0,"Generally, if you have to ask if this dog is right for you, it's not.

I consider the CO (or Caucasian Shepherd) to be the hardest and riskiest dog to own.  They can be wonderful for the right owners/homes, but very few are equipped to responsibly own one.

If bred properly, they tend to be some of the most protective (and over protective) and even agressive dogs.  When you combine this with their size, they are some of the most potentially dangerous dogs in existence.  This nature is in their DNA and you can't train it away.  If you have one, should should still do your best to train it and manage it, but you CANNOT train away its protective nature.  It's not uncommon for a CO to not let people visit your house, even if you say it's OK.  I wouldn't recommend them for people who are social or like to invite people (including extended family) or other dogs over. You can't have anyone visit your house while you're not there with the dog (e.g., to clean, repair, walk the dog, etc.).  With possible very rare exception, you shouldn't take this breed to a dog park.  Also, some COs might like hiking a bit (esp. around a large property), but if/when they don't feel like going any further, there's nothing you can do but wait.

However, they are often extremely loyal and good with family members who live with them and make amazing guard dogs.  I don't believe they are always great with children, but if you train the dog well and supervise, I think there's a good enough chance it's good enough with kids who live with it.

Anyway, the fact that you're asking us if it's the right dog for you makes me think it isn't.  However, if you really want one do A LOT of research on the breed, learn a lot about its parents, and make sure the breeder signs a written agreement to take the dog back if it doesn't work out (this last point is an absolute must).

Also, for anyone who IS an appropriate fit for a CO and is looking, there is a new litter of completely and deceptively adorable CO puppies in Northern CA almost ready for adoption/rescue.  Please let me know if you're interested and I can give you more info!"
