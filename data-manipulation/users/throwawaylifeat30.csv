college,ffnckzm,t3_eu9gt8,1580064293.0,"Hey OP, don't worry about it.  I honestly didn't make many friends in college (I have at most 5).  Just keep doing your own thing.  You'll eventually meet people who you vibe with, during or after college.  I personally dislike going to parties because I'd rather be at home learning stuff on my computer or building stuff.  That doesn't mean I can't hold a conversation with other people or socialize well.  Socialization is a skill everyone should learn.  So you know what you dislike.  That's good.  Think about what you do like.  What hobbies do you have?  Maybe join clubs based around those hobbies or interests."

Theres a big problem:  My current situation is that all my extracurriculars (internship/projects/clubs) are in a completely different area from my degree.  I graduate this May.  Jobs expect you to hit the ground running so I don't see how I'm qualified for any job, let alone the job I want.  So I'm screwed either way.  If I don't get a masters, I might not even get hired in my current situation.  If I go for the masters, I'm not even sure its exactly what I want because I don't know what program I'll get into and if that program will give me what I want out of the degree.  

>Enjoy life a little. Learn how to be a real adult. 

I wish I could.  I've been miserable for a while now due to worrying over this issue.  Its hard because I get sad when other people ask me if I applied to jobs or what my plan is after graduation.  The truth is that I have a plan but the problem I don't how things are going to turn out because the route I'm going to get into the career I want is unconventional and there is discrimination, by companies, to not want to hire me."

college,ff2eitd,t3_er52nj,1579502846.0,"Hey OP, I hate college too but for a different reason.  I'm essentially going to classes I hate for a major I don't care about because my school won't let me change majors to the one I do like (stupid gpa requirement that requires both overall AND university gpa to meet a minimum threshold).  My school doesn't even offer a minor in the major I'm interested in.  As a final ""screw you"" from my school, they apply a ""major lock"" on courses so I can't even take the courses I'm interested in at the other colleges.  I hate my university so much.  I can't wait to graduate and get out of this hell hole in a couple of months."
math,ff1rlo4,t1_ff19dqs,1579484631.0,"Thank you for your reply. 

The main reason I ask is because I'm pursuing an unconventional career path where there's essentially no guarantee that companies may hire me at the end.  So, I'm looking for some fallback plan if this plan doesn't work.

My background is as follows:  I can program in C and MATLAB.  I'm familiar with C++ (along with some OOP) and R.  I've taken the following courses:  Set Theory, Abstract Algebra, Real Analysis, Complex Analysis, Number Theory, Operations Research, Mathematical Modeling (both stochastic and deterministic models), and Multiple Linear Regression.  I've also taken Electricity and Magnetism and Physics 1 (Classical Physics).

However, in terms of extracurriculars, everything else I've done has been in the realm of Electrical/Computer engineering, specifically low-level code programming.  I did two team academic projects:  1 using Arduino to create a solar tracker project and 2. A simple radar system based off of hardware.  On both of these projects, I was responsible for software (C/C++ for #1, MATLAB for #2).  Furthermore, I did an Embedded Software internship where I essentially was coding in C/C++.

My goal is to get into Embedded Software, specifically around Digital Signal Processing because that's where I can somewhat leverage my math background.  However, its extremely difficult because these companies mostly hire Computer and Electrical Engineers and sometimes, Computer Science majors.  I've been doing a lot of independent studying of the topics in this field.  

If you are wondering why I don't pursue grad school, I want to.  However, due to my poor transcript history and low gpa (3.2), I want to work a few years because I hear that it can help improve my application.  Additionally, obviously grad school is very expensive.  I want to make sure I'm financially okay before I make such a commitment."
findapath,ff0wmc4,t1_ff0isc9,1579472983.0,"yes which is why the details matter here.  Its not like I stayed in university for 9 years.  I transferred from community college.  The bulk of my failures were during community college.  I've only spent 3.5 years in university but if you compare my grades at university vs. community college, you'll see a drastic improvement in grades.  My university grades are decent (above 3.5 gpa).  My overall gpa stinks (3.1) because of my poor grades at community college.  

If I told you that every day for 9 years, I slacked off in college and kept failing classes over and over, then you'd probably say that's a huge red flag that maybe school isn't right for me.  But, my situation is different.  Once I found my motivation, that's when I started caring about school and working my ass off.

If I was motivated and worked my ass off at the start of community college, I wouldn't be in this situation in the first place.  Like, sure, maybe I would have been a little lost but I think I would've had more options than I do now."
findapath,ff09yu0,t1_feyhml5,1579466761.0,I've worked part-time throughout school and have little debt.
findapath,ff092ii,t1_feytv0x,1579466512.0,thank you for providing the advice I needed.  This was very enlightening.
findapath,ff08o7w,t1_fez0f56,1579466359.0,"I'm going to echo what /r/zogecko  because he understood what I was asking for  

""looking for advice that allows you to ignore other advice""

So my success/path will not be tied to other people's investment in me.  The past 9 years, it was, and I plan to pay them back tenfold for it.  The path ahead will be rough but I can at least say that I'd rather struggle financially and be happy than be miserable doing a job, wondering why I didn't pursue the career I wanted despite going to 9 years of school."
findapath,ff078ox,t1_fez1hbn,1579465922.0,"I initially went into school of pressure from my family and during the early parts of it, I failed because I wasn't motivated to do well.  I didn't have well-defined goals in mind."
findapath,ff06xr5,t1_fezanco,1579465810.0,"Sorry I should've clarified this.  So I am finishing my degree (I graduate in 4 months).  I do my independent study essentially on weekends and any hour of the day where I have free time.  

In regards to the people who helped finance my years of college, they just want to see me graduate college (they don't care what the degree is or where its from).  However, this was the pressure that caused me to haphazardly rush into school in the first place.  Additionally, I feel that its my responsibility to pay them back, tenfold, for every bit of help they provided me which will come when I start working.  The job I want to pursue is a programming job so I don't think I'll have any issues there in regards to money.

But again, 9 frickin years of going to school is tiring.  I desperately need a break."
math,fewu5bu,t3_embohl,1579419530.0,"This isn't a personal attack on anyone but why is it that whenever I come here to ask about career advice/options, I get either no or little feedback despite that this community is big and theres tons of math major employed professionals here?  

My question is what type of software job opportunities exist for applied math majors?"
careerguidance,fewtjwc,t1_few8wpp,1579419276.0,this is something I am struggling SO hard with.  My degree is useless for the job I want (which is software engineering but low level C/C++ programming).  May I ask details on what type of work/complexity of projects you presented on your resume?
careerguidance,fewtcdh,t1_fewb2gs,1579419189.0,"> you can either change positions in the same field 

I was thinking about doing this and a recruiter told me that I could start as a test engineer and a year later, after they review my performance, change over to a software developer role.  The problem is that pigeonholing is a real thing in industry.  If you have a year of experience in QA/Testing practices, they see you more as that type of engineer."
ISTJ,fega904,t1_feg4wu3,1579084595.0,"yeah, so I heard that internships are easier to get than FT jobs so I've been applying mostly for internships.  The problem is that internships mostly hire students who are still in school.  For a summer internship, I'd be out of school by that time.  From my applications, really haven't heard back from anyone.  There was one internship that I applied to where I did get to interview with the hiring manager but after that, I followed up with the recruiter who said ""your interview was fine.  the issue is that we're looking for a junior year student (NOT mentioned in the job description) and you'll be looking for a full-time job following graduation"".  He went on to say that they'll keep my application but then also urged me to look for other positions (sounded like they weren't interested in me)."

ISTJ,fecx8as,t1_fe6529n,1578988277.0,"Yeah, I've gone on that subreddit however barely got 2-3 responses that were not helpful (very blunt and vague answers that did not say whether or not I had a chance).  These companies demand ALOT of experience out of new grads for their positions, specific to the job position I am trying to pursue.  I have relevant internship and project experience too but haven't really gotten any phone calls back.  Also, I'm based in the U.S.  I'm practicing my coding and just trying to read a lot of stuff.  Its frightening to think that I won't have a job in 6 months post graduation but I have to keep looking around."
CalPolyPomona,fdxkaoc,t1_fdoxkma,1578769610.0,more like Cal Trans intentionally chose this date and period so they wouldn't have to deal with outrage (as opposed to closing it off midway through the semester causing unnecessary traffic on Kellog Drive).  They've done this several times before on several semesters.
ISTJ,fdurtx7,t3_emyvay,1578737912.0,"Unemployed Math major student graduating this May.  
My dream career is become an  low-level software Engineer which will allow me to do cool things with electronics and computers (I've loved working with both since my childhood).  

Companies won't hire me because of my degree (not engineering or computer science)."
selfimprovement,fdcixsa,t1_fdc5rty,1578276045.0,"Yeah so I feel that since my job is more software-side, its more about knowledge despite that its more common for companies to hire certain majors.  Yes, I do have a ""smart"" goals list that's been compiled from what I found online and a few couple of job openings.  Overall, the plan is to build a strong foundation in knowledge of the basics and utilize projects as a way to demonstrate my knowledge.  

This is probably one of the tougher things for me to do: leaving home to study elsewhere.  I'm way more comfortable studying at home.  I'll try it again and see how this goes.  
  
Yeah, I think I experience something similar.  For me, I'm doing something difficult like trying to solve a hard physics problem.  Its easier for me to say ""this is difficult so I'm going to take a break and do something easy like playing video games"" then I come back to the difficult physics problem and this vicious cycle continues.  This doesn't happen all the time but for some situations, it does.  Similarly, if something is very tedious/boring to me like reading a textbook to learn some topic, its harder for me to do it for hours.  For example, I'm trying to re-learn a language and I'm going through this 800 page textbook because its quite thorough and a good resource.  Its not like the material is difficult.  Its just tedious and so, its hard for me to do it.  I've been slacking off during my break horribly when I could've completed this book by now."
selfimprovement,fdcff56,t1_fdc67t8,1578273566.0,"I have an erratic sleep schedule.  Since I'm on school break and don't have a job, I've been sleeping at 2-3 am and waking up around 11 am.  When school starts again, I will be expecting to sleep around 11 pm and waking up around 7 am.  The thing too is that I don't always keep a consistent sleep schedule.  I would generalize waking up somewhere between 9am-12pm."
GetMotivated,fdbyqrv,t3_ehdy5f,1578263996.0,"I am unhappy/miserable with where I am in life and I know part of the reason is that I lack the desire to do things that are difficult in the sense they require a lot of effort and time. What are some good ways to combat this?


Long story short, I am 26 years old graduating in May with an undergrad degree in a useless major. Its a useless degree because the job that I want usually hires other majors. In order for me to have a fighting chance against these more qualified applicants, I need to put in 500-1000 hours to study the right material. However, I feel like I've taken on a defeatist attitude because even if I put in the work, I feel like there's no guarantee I'll get hired by the end of it. But, I know I should still work my ass off and do it because this is what I want to do with my life. 


Furthermore, I'm taking a relatively big load of classes this semester and I really want to ace all my classes because I want to pursue grad school for a competitive major and my gpa is pretty low (its 3.1). Even though I set up my schedule so that I'd have days off of school, I feel like I won't be able to optimize that time to do self-studying in addition to my school obligations."
selfimprovement,fdbtury,t1_fdbsq20,1578262023.0,"I don't want people to focus on this aspect of the post because its not the point of this thread in this sub but my answer is:

My degree is in Applied Math.  The job I want is to be an Embedded Software Engineer which typically hires either engineers or computer science majors.  I don't know if this is the ""optimal"" path but from me asking around in the proper subreddits, people say that the interview is mostly knowledge-based so my plan is to put in 500-1000 hours to learn certain topics (software-related and etc) and work on projects in my own time so I can put these on my resume.  For now, my end goal is just to become an embedded software developer who gets to work on computers.  

Eventually, I was going to attend grad school for an engineering degree which would actually help me land the job I want easier."
CalPolyPomona,fctr7s6,t1_fcs0nvn,1577955318.0,so done with this school...just want to graduate and leave.
CalPolyPomona,fctr6wg,t3_eimzvz,1577955283.0,"Last semester I got a D in an upper division course (in my major) due to poor time management.  Spring is my last semester.  My New Years resolution is to pass these last 4 classes and do really well in them, with at least B's in each class.  I will graduate and never look OR come back."
CalPolyPomona,fal8di7,t3_e9kdie,1576180107.0,"its because we don't have time due random things coming up.  I had a whole plan to study a lot during thanksgiving weekend AND the week before finals.  It didn't happen.  I went on a family trip during that extended weekend because I thought I'd have downtime to study (brought all my homework/notes with  me).  I was jetlagged so bad that I kept falling asleep the entire trip.  Got 0 schoolwork and studying done.  Fast forward to the week before finals: homework was literally piled up because professors tend to think of the break as an opportunity for students to do more homework.  I got literally 10 hours of sleep in 3 days to catch up on the homework.  I had a final exam that Friday so I didn't sleep and just studied for 12 hours straight.  I failed that exam.  Stuff kept coming up randomly that week which prevented me from getting good studying at all.  So then, finals week comes and its Monday.  I study for 15 hours straight (no sleep) right before my two back-to-back finals on Tuesday.  Didn't do well on the first exam because my memory was doing very poorly despite having spent at least 5 hours studying this material prior.  My other two exams turned out fine only because the professors allowed a page of notes/""cheat sheet"" to be used on the exam.  

Also test anxiety and stress are always factors you cannot prep for in the 15 weeks of schooling we have for every class.   It doesn't matter if I studied 50 hours or 10 hours.  When I get that exam, I'm going to be really scared because most of the time, I don't know what type of questions are on the exam (could be curveballs, material that I'm weak on).    

Trust me, as students, we also know that taking the time to study for exams would result in a better grade/performance.  But, we're human too.  When you have to balance so many things at once, you're bound to make mistakes because theres only so much time you have to complete this mountain of tasks."
