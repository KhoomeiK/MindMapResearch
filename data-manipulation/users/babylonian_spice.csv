apexlegends,fcrppei,t3_eih2je,1577904959.0,If I didnâ€™t see your gamer tag I would have thought that be me ðŸ˜‚
LearnUselessTalents,fcmd9nz,t1_fcma3p3,1577771173.0,Try it. Maybe my friends and I are just more coordinated but it hasnâ€™t failed yet.
coolguides,fclubwf,t1_fclmuwu,1577756659.0,Yup no one cares enough to do their due diligence so they just listen to what the talking heads are angry about today. The dumbifying of America is basically complete
LearnUselessTalents,fclob5q,t3_efo4ar,1577752502.0,Catch your opponent off guard on your first turn. Make eye contact and then toss it underhand. Half the time theyâ€™ll catch it before it reaches the rack. Easy cup. Works especially well the more inebriated they are.
LearnUselessTalents,fclmc42,t3_ehufrv,1577751154.0,I know if you high five someone and you both look at each others elbows itâ€™ll always connect. Might work with handshakes
coolguides,fcllrg6,t3_ehr3fr,1577750759.0,Gerrymandering is low key one of the biggest problems in our government that no one seems to know about.
apexlegends,f6jgeg7,t3_dri7v0,1572894313.0,Very well stated! A lot of what you said can be translated to the real world too.
