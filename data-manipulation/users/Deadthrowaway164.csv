Nioh,ffe1gyj,t1_ffdbhr4,1579834239.0,"i mean, the souls genre(enough games to call it a genre) key strats are to not get greedy(you’ll get pancaked in higher levels if you do), learn from mistakes, and look at bosses as obstacles, not an immovable mountain. knowing these facts, you can achieve a lot more than you think you could.

Mistakes should be thought of as stepping stones, not punishments.


I mean, when i first played Nioh, I was spending days at a time trying to figure out Onryoki. eventually I did and slayed him.

fast forward a year of playing(looking at trying to complete all 999 levels of Abyss), I just mow him over like he is nothing."
