It’s nice for planning trips, which I’m just now coming off a 2 week vacation abroad and returning to work this week. 

Prior, my last employer was a regional non-profit hospital system  and you could roll over your 2 weeks every year and have up to 6mo worth of PTO (and anything rolled over after that goes into a “long term” bank that becomes accessible for retirement, allowing you to retire a year early or more, and still be on payroll. One way the organization incentivized you to stay for the long run). However I wasn’t a clinician and didn’t have a big team working in admin overseeing multiple service lines, so could barely find people to cover my responsibilities for extended time off. Ironically I take more PTO now for a large for-profit firm than I did at that non-profit hospital lol. 

My brother’s company has unlimited PTO. But same deal, where it’s tough for him particularly to find coworkers to cover his responsibilities for more than a week’s time.
