Amazing score right there!!

Edit - hmm, I guess not... I'll definitely be doing my research next time. My apologies, everyone. :/"
coins,ff8t5z2,t1_ff8pe15,1579695138.0,"I could never decide which is my favorite: the Standing Liberty quarter or the Seated Liberty.

That's a tough one for me. I mean, the Seated Liberties are awesome alone just because of their dates/age - and design. But the Standing Liberty obverse design is just so fucking dope. The level of detail is insane on them (well, before they wear down)!"
AskReddit,feptzmo,t1_feo0aud,1579331223.0,"I can't afford the internet anymore. Mine got cut awhile ago. I don't even have cellphone service anymore.

There's a library right down the street from me and that's where I've been able to get connected to the internet. It's where I go to try and find jobs and then browse Reddit once I'm done for the day looking for employment.

Nice try, though.

Edit: and I'll also connect to my girlfriend's hotspot when she comes by and sleeps over, just fyi."
