Second, you think she's hard to live with now? You think she'll be hard to live with if you press them? Ohhhhhhhh boy. Wait till you drop those charges and she's feeling like superman.

Pressing these charges all the way out may not result in real jail time for her, but it will accomplish certain things: it'll let her know you're the wrong one to fuck with, and it'll establish a legal record of her behavior which will protect you from bleeding heart cops who think you were stealing expensive electronics from your own house.

IDontWorkHereLady,ff2409y,t3_er1vxm,1579493190.0,"You gotta learn to stop apologizing for shit that ain't your problem.

You started that engagement off with ""I'm sorry, but...."" Any reasonable person would understand you were expressing empathy, not remorse, but work retail long enough and you'll figure out a lot retail customers are the opposite of reasonable persons. ""Looks like you're in the wrong department for that"" would have been a better response.

It takes practice, but make a conscious effort to never, ever apologize unless you've made an actual mistake. Especially don't apologize for someone's long wait. We get it. Waiting sucks. We all have things to do. But waiting is part of the retail experience. Are you really supposed to apologize for being successful? Instead try, ""thank you for your patience.""

The reason you don't apologize is the second you do, at least in the mind of a Karen, you've admitted some sort of fault, and now you've take a mind that was already wired to give you shit and primed it with a built-in excuse to speak to the manager and demand some sort of consideration."

This is a severe lack of respect for another person's boundaries. Nothing more. Nothing less. When the kid asked, she said ""no"". Why is further elaboration required?

It's an attempt to make that girl responsible for the kid's lack of manners and respect, and sorry, but that's just not how any of this works.

12-year-olds are not babies. At that age the concept of ""no"" should be deeply ingrained. This is definitely an example of entitled. ""I get to touch your stuff because my mom said so"".

*A lot* of people think being socially awkward and anxious = introvert. A lot of people are wrong.

Both introverts and extroverts can be outgoing and socially savvy. Both introverts and extroverts can be socially awkward and have anxiety. One has nothing to do with the other. They don't even belong in the same conversation.

The shorthand comparison: extroverts are energized by social interaction. The more they get, the better they feel. Long periods of alone time wears them right out. They're also more likely to be adrenaline junkies and appreciate attention. Extroverts will be first in line for that scary, new roller coaster while posing front and center for the company ugly sweater photo.

Introverts are energized by quiet time, whether that be alone or with a small group of close friends. They enjoy social outings just fine, but they do find it draining, and will need time after to recharge. In other words, your introvert friend will go out to the club with you on Saturday night, but come Sunday they might close the curtains and turn their phone off. Introverts are also not typically adrenaline junkies or enjoy attention. They might avoid that roller coaster entirely, and probably won't even participate in the ugly sweater contest.

Introverts are not lonely because they're alone. Extroverts usually are. Introverts will have a small group of very close friends. Extroverts will have a whole stable of acquaintances to ensure they're always someone available to socialize with.

PublicFreakout,fem2i16,t1_fej7iwz,1579237601.0,"It's a lot bigger than seeking out pets to shoot. It's a general trend of police doing just about any damned thing they want to the public knowing there are likely to be no consequences whatsoever.

You here about police shooting dogs all the time. There are videos of it. There are some videos where it's crystal clear the dog isn't a threat of any sort, yet it gets shot, anyway.

And yet with all these examples of misuse of authority, there are rarely consequences, if ever. They're not even afraid of cameras anymore.

And as I started out, it's not just about dogs. They treat citizens the same way. So you're right, the simplest solution is likely correct, and that solution is we are, even as we speak, in the middle of a police state. Don't agree? Then please explain why domestic police need to train in military tactics and use military equipment while engaging a civilian population?

No, not all police are evil tyrants, but ""the brotherhood"" is all too quick to circle the wagons when one of their own is under scrutiny, which makes the so-called good cops just as bad as the bad ones.

The police system in the US has nothing to do with ""keeping the peace"" or ""to protect and to serve"". It's all about ""law enforcement"". That phrasing right there lets you know where their priorities are. They think they're a special kind of authority, above the laws they presume to execute, and they do not appreciate you challenging them. Anyone, or anything, that challenges that authority instantly goes on the endangered species list."

As far as a written agreement goes, it doesn't have to be a treatise on legal terms. It doesn't have to be drafted by a stable of lawyers to be binding, either. Although some things just aren't enforceable. It can be real, human language, and it can be short. You just need to outline what you expect, what your client can expect from you, a few contingencies in case of unexpected circumstances(computer failure, tornadoes, etc.), agreed upon price, and percentage of the non-refundable deposit.

And yes, that deposit is absolutely critical. First, it weeds out the dipshits who aren't ready to do business. Second, it gives you a little cushion in case a good thing goes south. Third, that deposit requires an investment on the part of your client. Once they're invested they're likely to hold up their end of the agreement more reliably.

And finally, the deposit, along with the rest of a well-written agreement, gives you an air of legitimacy. It shows  potential clients that you take your time and your work seriously. They'll take you more seriously, too. It shows that you value your work, which can unexpectedly help your clients value it. Presenting a thoughtful written contract will make whatever rates you charge an easier sell.

fuckHOA,fdtx3j1,t1_fcxe0sa,1578723621.0,"It absolutely matters. It matters a lot.

Just because you post something in public doesn't mean you forfeit ownership, unless specified by the platform used. And this particular platform isn't granted ownership of your content when you use it. It does give them certain license, but license is not ownership.

The second you create something, anything, it becomes your intellectual property, and you have the right to distribute (or not distribute) as you see fit, again, unless the terms of the platform specify otherwise. And you don't have to file a copyright to create ownership, either. Filing a copyright simply creates a legal record of your ownership. Copyright poofs into existence the second your intellectual property does.

Obviously, copyright law is much more nuanced than this, but generally speaking, if someone else uses your intellectual property to generate income for themselves without your express permission, you are within your rights to oppose that usage.

Proving ownership is another thing, entirely. Sometimes you need that legal record to prove ownership to a legal standard, but that's a somewhat different conversation.

In all actuality, that little disclaimer is totally unnecessary to enforce a copyright claim. OP doesn't need it at all. Consent is assumed revoked unless it's explicitly given. You can't take someone else's stuff and then use ""*they didn't tell me I couldn't*"" as justification. All the italics really does is give people fair warning that OP has every intention of enforcing his ownership of this content should it be used without his consent in a way he doesn't approve of."

socialskills,fdljwx7,t3_elzcyu,1578525690.0,"Getting along with people and enjoying social time has absolutely nothing to do with being an introvert or an extrovert. It's not about strengthening friendships or awkwardness or anxiety or anything like that.

The difference between the two is that extroverts are energized by social activity. They're also thrill-seekers and risk-takers. Introverts are energized by quiet time, either alone or with a small group of close friends.

Both groups enjoy socializing and being around friends.

Extroverts get pumped by it, though, and the more they get, the happier they are. They don't need a tight inner circle. The more friends they got the happier they are. The longer the socializing goes, the more energized they are. Spending extended amounts of time alone can wear an extrovert out, and they need to get back to the crowd to recharge eventually.

Conversely, introverts are mentally exhausted by it. They enjoy going out just fine, but their friends will have to get used to the fact that after they've had a fun night out, their introvert will need a day or two at home with the curtains drawn and the ringer off to recharge. 

Both groups are equally capable of building strong relationships and having social savvy. Both groups are equally capable of struggling to make friends and being socially awkward.

So in order to define yourself as one or the other you need to determine where your energy comes from. Appreciating an occasional quiet night in doesn't make you an introvert anymore than going out once in awhile makes you an extrovert.

Also, bear in mind it's not necessarily a zero sum game. It's a spectrum and you could have tendencies to one side or the other but more or less floating in the middle. Also consider it *might not be that important* that you affix one label or the other to yourself so long as your friends respect your time.

They're not typos. They're legitimate grammar errors. Phonetically, ***could of*** sounds nearly identical to ***could've***, hence the confusion. But as we all know, English takes great pride in being non-phonetic.

***X've*** (where X= could, would, or should) is a contraction. A contraction combines two common words into a single word. The second word in this particular contraction is ***have***. The indisputable correct spelling is always, always ***X've****,* or separate as ***X have****.*

***Could****,* ***would***, and ***should***, as well as words like ***can, may, might***, and ***must****,* are verbs. More specifically they are modal verbs, which indicates something along the lines of eventuality, duty, or capacity. ***Have*** is also a verb.

A verb is an action. In the sentence ""***Johnny chased the ball****""* the word ***chased*** is the verb, indicating Johnny did something with the ball.

So when a sentence includes the word ***should've*** (should have) the implication is you did not perform a particular action you were either capable of performing or expected to perform. ""You ***should have*** called first.""

***Of*** is not a verb. It is a preposition, which shows one object is related to another. *Helen* ***of*** *Troy, leg* ***of*** *lamb,* and *off the top* ***of*** *my head* are examples using the word ***of***.

In other words, people ***have*** all the time. The can ***have***, they could ***have***, they should ***have***, they would ***have.*** You can insert any verb you like after the words ***could***, ***should***, or ***would*** and, disregarding context, they will all sound perfectly fine. You ***could*** eat. You ***would*** run. You ***should*** study.

The reason ***have*** is correct is because it is a verb. You can ***have*** which means you could ***have***, would ***have***, and should ***have***. But no one has ever ""***ofed***"", and since you cannot presently ***of***, you never could ***of***, you never would ***of***, and you most certainly never, ever should ***of***.

I assume you are an extrovert because if you were an introvert you wouldn't have written this the way you did. I didn't create a narrative. You used a word incorrectly. That's no narrative. It's just a factual thing.

I didn't accuse you of attacking introverts. I accused you of using a word wrong, *which is what you did*.

I'm not being defensive. I'm trying to get you to acknowledge you've used a word wrong, and trying (unsuccessfully, it appears) to get you to *stop using it wrong*.

There was no projection. I was explaining, as clearly as I know how, that you were.... *using the word wrong*....

But somehow, after all this back-and-forth, instead of offering to correct yourself, you keep defending what you wrote. It is now at this point I'm beginning to think you meant to use that word all the time, without even understanding what it truly means to be an extrovert or an introvert, so maybe I should get a little defensive.

Let me break it down to you one. Last. Time.

""Extrovert"" does not mean outgoing and socially-skilled.

""Introvert"" does not mean self-conscious, low self-esteem, and low social skills.

Both introverts and extroverts are perfectly capable of a high level of social skill.

Both introverts and extroverts are perfectly capable of being absolutely inept.

""Introvert/extrovert"" is not an measure of social acumen. *You're using the words wrong*.

Introverts are not looking to be adopted by sympathetic extroverts. They don't need to be drawn out of their shells. They are not lonely because they are alone. They do not lack social savvy. They do not lack self-confidence. They do not lack the ability to stay fit and clean. None of those things are indicators of introversion.

Now that I've explained what an introvert/extrovert is not, here is what they *are*.

Extroverts are energized by social interaction. They'll take as much of it as they can get as often as they can get it. Introverts are energized by either being alone, or with a small group of close friends in a quiet setting (thank you, persectiveisjawn). Introverts enjoy a good party just like anybody else, but they're going to need a day or two afterwards to charge back up. Extroverts become drained and melancholy if they're isolated for large chunks of time.

Extroverts are thrill-seekers and enjoy a healthy amount of attention. If you see someone super excited about the scariest ride at the amusement park or the stupid ugly sweater contest at work, they're probably an extrovert. Introverts are not thrill-seekers. Most hobbies introverts enjoy don't involve a high level of adrenaline, and they prefer to draw as little attention to themselves as possible.

Extroverts are risk-takers. They follow a big risk, big reward philosophy. They'll put it all on the line just for a promise of a big payback at the end. Introverts typically play it close to the vest, opting for modest risk, modest gains.

Obviously, there's some crossover and blurred lines, but that's the gist.

As you can see, not one of those descriptions have anything at all to do with wanting to socialize and be accepted, but lacking the skill to do so.

There are lots of people who can make good use of your advise, but it's not because they're an introvert or an extrovert. ***Stop using the word wrong***. Good grief."
socialskills,fcjpfvq,t1_fcjniru,1577698010.0,"You're so incredibly, completely wrong, and you're doing a great job of proving my point of just how difficult it is for an extrovert to fully comprehend what it means to be an introvert. You think because you crave social interaction and because you thrive from it, then everyone else must, as well. You are wrong.

It's not about ""value"" or ""practice"" or (lol) ""anchors"". Being an introvert isn't a disease, affliction, or impediment. It doesn't need to be cured.  Introverts are exhausted by social interaction. Extroverts are energized by it. Introverts aren't people who just need to get better at being extroverts. What's so hard about that to understand?

If your introverted friend tells you they don't want to go out, it's because they, wait for it, don't want to go out. The absolute last thing they want, or need, is you ""pushing"" them to do so. You clearly do not understand what an introvert is, you certainly don't know what a common case for one is, and you definitely don't respect your friends' boundaries.

The things you wrote are decent enough as far as general life advice goes. The problem is you're just plain using the word ""introvert"" wrong. You're equating it with awkwardness, self-consciousness, self-worth, social ineptness, blah blah blah, and you're just so totally wrong. One has nothing to do with the others. ""Socially-awkward"" and ""introvert"" are not synonymous. They're just not. If you mean ""socially-awkward"" then say that. Stop using ""introvert"" in its place. It's not the same thing."
socialskills,fcjncf7,t3_ehgt12,1577695036.0,"You're using the word ""introvert"" wrong.

Being an introvert has absolutely nothing to do with confidence, being, awkward, socially-inept, or even anti-social.

Introverts don't crave attention they're not getting. Introverts aren't lonely because they're alone.

The difference between an introvert and an extrovert is a relatively simple concept, yet most extroverts struggle to understand. Extroverts are energized by social interaction while introverts are drained by it. And that's it.

Introverts don't spend time alone because they can't figure out a way around it. They do it because they're freaking exhausted. Introverts are not anti-social or have trouble socializing *when they want to*. They just need time after to recharge.

Being socially-awkward, self-conscious, lacking self-esteem, etc. are all separate and distinct issues that afflict introverts and extroverts alike, and have nothing to do with one or the other.

None of the things you describe have anything at all to do with introvert/extrovert. Introverts don't struggle socially. Extroverts just *think* they do. The only social struggle introverts have is extroverted friends who don't respect their boundaries when they say they'd rather stay in."
