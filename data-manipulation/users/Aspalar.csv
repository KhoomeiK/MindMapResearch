>1. That the accused wrongfully had sexual intercourse with a certain person;  
2. That, at the time, the accused or the other person was married to someone else; and  
3. That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.  

You will meet 1 and 2(if married to one of them), but maybe not 3. It goes on to expand upon what constitutes prejudice of good order and discipline. Basically you are *probably* okay as long as none of your partners are in the military, they all are aware and okay with polyamory, and you don't talk about it at work. As an officer though I would imagine you are more likely to come under fire for it. If you aren't married you can't commit adultery unless one of your partners is married."
