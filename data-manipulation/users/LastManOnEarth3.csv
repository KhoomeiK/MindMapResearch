Ultralight,feakhd3,t1_fe9nqop,1578949876.0,"Agreed :( Just took it out on the Florida trail and was really looking forward to a functional poncho tarp. Instead it’s a suboptimal poncho that catches too easily in the wind, and a shelter I need to curl up to fit in. Add to that it’s 12 oz with seam sealing and there are simply much better options (e.g. 7x9 tarp w/ bug bivy and a frog togg)."

uofmn,fd468na,t3_ek0q3x,1578164788.0,"Study. Everyday. It’s not that hard in actuality but your brain needs time to absorb the material. Don’t just go to lecture, read the textbook. If you understand 100% of the reasoning behind everything is true you can never fail. Don’t stress too hard, just make sure you’re getting in an hour a day on weekdays till you’re comfortable, then switch to whatever you need. Just make sure that under no circumstances do you stop reading and understanding the textbook. Learn the proofs. It won’t be tested but if you can, say, understand the reasoning by the ratio test, you won’t need to memorize it. Always remember that math is beautiful and fascinating and if you don’t feel that you’re doing something wrong in your studies, keep studying proofs until it’s beautiful."
