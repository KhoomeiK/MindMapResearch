I am sorry, I am quite stupid in these things. 
But I do still think That it is not a bad thing trying to save the enviroment. I think it is wrong to pressure a person for helping the enviroment in Europe rather than in the more worse countries, such as china. 

The Point that I am saying, is that No one should be against a girl just trying to help the Enviroment in Europe. Either way what are the consequences of Saving the Earth? Nothing Negative."

Also, alot of Divisions in a single tile is bad, especially during a landing, because you won't have enough supplies. So good Unit Templates in Fewer numbers can beat the enemies atleast a bit better. Also you probably should get more fighters in Production, since the Air and Navy are one of the biggest things USA has to take care of."
