blackmagicfuckery,ffp7tor,t3_eu7xys,1580088392.0,It looks like a model building with holograms inside. Not even real.
Whatcouldgowrong,ffox7g4,t3_eu7h8q,1580082905.0,I really hope the car that recorded this stayed and showed the officers. I bet that asshole tried to play the victim here.  Most people on the road think they are the best drivers and everyone else is just there way. It’s sad.

Cheers."
facepalm,ffo9r5h,t3_eu5bp0,1580075466.0,It’s just odd to have someone not nearly as popular the others on the same list. Maybe I’m just out of touch or whoever made this meme has a strong passion for this guy. Idk
facepalm,ffo6ybu,t1_ffn1zsi,1580074764.0, Still No clue who he is. The other guys are super popular though.
facepalm,ffo6g6w,t1_fflwpu7,1580074597.0,Zero clue what lazy town is.
facepalm,ffo62nl,t1_fflnyl8,1580074465.0,I literally don’t know him or the shows you’ve listed.   How is he in the same list as everyone else?
facepalm,ffo59q6,t3_eu5bp0,1580074330.0,"Who’s the guy in the bottom left?

Edit: Nevermind, read the other posts. Apparently I’m not the only one who has no idea who he is."

Whatcouldgowrong,ffn4ls6,t3_eu7hpw,1580062029.0,What is up with all the videos that end so abruptly like this?  Why cut it short?
JusticeServed,ffm2fjj,t1_ffleoyl,1580047447.0,Apparently his story is he was drunk and went to the wrong door. He thought the old lady was an intruder in his apartment.
classicwow,ffjozoe,t3_etyq64,1580003350.0,They literally just had a ban wave though. Remember all the people crying here that they got falsely banned?  Some of which actually did.
Whatcouldgowrong,ffjos2z,t3_etz2e0,1580003206.0,What’s with all the video abruptly ending like this?  It’s so unsatisfying.
WatchPeopleDieInside,ffjie72,t3_etdmdz,1579998900.0,I feel that this was a set up. I’ve seen people who are double jointed and can do that to with their arm easily.  A buddy of mine can do it and he likes freaking people out with it. He’ll walk into a house and tell everyone he was just hit by a car.
interestingasfuck,ffjgn9r,t1_ffj526u,1579997835.0,"It’s there.  It’s hard to notice because the earth is bigger than a basketball...

But seriously, just hold the flat edge of a piece of paper on it and you’ll see it."
Whatcouldgowrong,fferk8l,t1_ffdyspj,1579862036.0,"Knocked unconscious? Why would you even think that they got knocked unconscious?  So everyone that falls to the ground in pain is knocked out?  They fell to the ground in pain because their eye just got shot at. I’m sure she was very much conscious.

Not everyone is going to have the same reaction that you think they should."
classicwow,ffdpp0c,t1_ffd7tcp,1579825997.0,Sounds boring. But I’m glad you think it’s awesome.
Whatcouldgowrong,ffdn26k,t1_ffczmiv,1579824375.0,It looks like it definitely hit her in the eye. Even if this was an air soft gun I assure you it would hurt..  don’t believe me?  Shoot yourself in the eye with one and let me know.
Whatcouldgowrong,ffcpxxu,t1_ffcf30n,1579804747.0,"Oh I see, so they might have blurred it so it seemed more gruesome than it actually was?"
Whatcouldgowrong,ffceec8,t1_ffc9efq,1579797666.0,They blurred the one because they got shot in the face.
classicwow,ff8pgl7,t1_ff7fw0b,1579690378.0,"I was in an AV and came across a priest bot. At least I’m pretty sure it was. It was mounted and would be riding the same path and as soon as I dotted it, it would dismount, bubble, and try to heal itself until I killed it. It did this over and over. I probably killed it 20 times before it stopped showing up because of different GY got capped."

GetMotivated,ff4seej,t3_erer0t,1579571309.0,"No, but I also don’t want to sell all of my stuff and/or go out begging strangers."
Whatcouldgowrong,ff1xgm6,t1_ff1ssfv,1579488399.0,Maybe you are the one that needs to reread this thread. And after looking at your history you seem like a young kid and a little toxic so I’m just going to end this conversation. Stay in school kid.
Whatcouldgowrong,ff1qnvy,t1_fez895g,1579484044.0,"You are clearly missing my point...  Like I said He has a mental health problem and needs help..

you can keep downvoting me and I’ll just keep downvoting you for literally saying the same damn thing. Reddit.. smh.."
Whatcouldgowrong,feyez7h,t1_fewgu9j,1579444590.0,Did you skip over the part where I said he might have mental health problems?  Maybe they should get that checked out?..
Whatcouldgowrong,fevc6ls,t3_eqn3z4,1579395678.0,"In my opinion he has some mental issues, he said he was going there to “shot people” and they think that sentencing him to a mere 8 months is going to reform him?"

ConvenientCop,fcoo441,t1_fconfsp,1577837115.0,The red car came flying up on his rear-end aggressively and probably would have most certainly tailgated until he moved. Look how close he was when the cop moved out of the way. He was less than a car length behind him. The cop probably thought he was about to get rear ended so instinctively swerved out of the way.
