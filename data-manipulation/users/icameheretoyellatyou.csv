I used to really like Lollipop Chainsaw, it'ssuper fun.  Also Devil May Cry. And Bayonetta. Those are hack n slash games

Also Alice: Madness Returns was suuuuuper pretty looking. Like honestly, so pretty. Story was kind of fucked up, which I like but some people might not

Also you can't go wrong with most Final Fantasies and they're always pretty

Shadow of the Colossus, I had it borrowed and didn't have the chance to finish it but it was good as far as I played 

If you're ok with horror (I'm not! I'm a huge pussy!) I'd say the Silent Hill earlier games, I watched my sister and dad play it and it's really good, you'll need nerves of steel but it's awesome 

I don't really play many PC games but I did play Hotline Miami 1 and 2, it's fast and fun

Oh and while technically I met it as Nintendo DS games the Ace Attorney series is really good and I think at least the Phoenix Wright part of the series is having a sale on steam right now"

fatlogic,felaak8,t1_fel93oe,1579217504.0,"You're myopic because you're only taking into  consideration the way you behave when faced with insults to say if words can hurt or not. Maybe you're an enlightened being who can just shake off everything people say, but most people aren't like that, so saying they're actually choosing to be offended is, hm... myopic."
