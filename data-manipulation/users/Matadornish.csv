trees,fe0538b,t3_enidax,1578803280.0,"Its kind of a tricky question youre asking. Knowing your tolerance to thc and the strength of your distillate would help but i’ll give you my best answer:

Distillate is usually 85-90% thc (ime)

So .6ml = 500-550mg of thc in your brownie batch. The average recommended dose of thc for a beginner is 10mg. So assuming the distillate is mixed evenly, if you cut your brownies into 50 equally sized pieces, each piece will have 10-11 mg of thc"

trees,fe01apy,t1_fdzydok,1578800614.0,"I appreciate that you skimmed through and read the subheadings. But if you would have continued to read right below that:

“Yet the overall trend, as with so much in American life, is toward bigger, badder, brawnier product, which means more THC-rich weed. Sure, it's conceivable that someone was smoking 30% THC pot back at Woodstock, but it's undoubtedly easier to get your hands on some now than it was in 1969. When we talk about marijuana being stronger today than it was a few decades ago, we're really talking about how the drug went from being an illicit commodity to the cornerstone of a regulated — and very profitable — national business”

Trust me man i have been smoking (buds, not leaves) for over 15 years and i’ve been in the cannabis industry for over 10. You can downvote me till the cows come home but it wont make you an expert on cannabis or its history. Weed has not gotten stronger, strong weed has just become more popular."
trees,fdzxcle,t1_fdz3rm8,1578798090.0,"...did you read the article?

Thc levels are NOT ‘increasing at an almost alarming rate’. 

High potency cannabis has existed for quite a while. Its availability is what is increasing, as well as testing/documentation. 

Just like you, most people are still learning about this plant and all it truly has to offer. Which gives the illusion that the plant itself is becoming more potent, which is not the case."
