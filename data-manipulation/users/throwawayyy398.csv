SuicideWatch,fdi5zvk,t3_elewpp,1578436335.0,I tried to kill myself back when I was 15 but I failed. I wish I had done it when I was 22 and had the chance.

SuicideWatch,fcaf5fb,t3_egukih,1577568175.0,Same. Two years ago in college it seemed like I was going to go on and do great things with my life. Instead it’s gone in a completely different direction and went downhill.
SuicideWatch,fca8q6x,t1_fc8cdqj,1577564795.0,I’m seeing about switching to a different one that I can afford. I majored in Animation and it’s been pretty competitive and a bit difficult landing a job (besides freelance work).

SuicideWatch,fc4r1ar,t3_efrofy,1577425285.0,"Had something similar happen last year. I made the mistake of telling a cop I was suicidal (I didn't know much about 5150's then and that they could commit you for saying that) and they forced me to be hospitalized. If given the choice I would've preferred to just go see a crisis counselor the same day instead of being forced inpatient. I didn't want my parents to find out I was suicidal or having mental health issues again (they have been abusive in the past and not understanding of depression and would make rude comments about it). I was forced to stay overnight since the only psychiatrist at the hospital had left for the day when I got there (and there was no overnight one). I got transferred to a mental hospital a few hours later, even though I hadn't been evaluated by a psychiatrist yet and the staff at the new one blackmailed me and refused to let me leave unless I told my parents about what happened (it was very traumatic) even though I didn't want my family involved. My mom just complained about me ""wasting money"" going to the hospital and my dad made jokes about it. Honestly was one of the most traumatizing things that ever happened to me."
