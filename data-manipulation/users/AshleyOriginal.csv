Don't think about the result, think about the journey.
Meet other people doing it and say ""if they can do it so can I"".

Also find it funny a TLDR on ""just doing it."" Just read the 5 min post lol."
chinchilla,fepeawb,t3_epdg0z,1579318375.0,"I converted two massive dog kennels into two cages (got them on sale for $100 apiece, big enough I fit in them), so easy to open, clean, and add items (though wire is a bummer (stuff doesn't fit as well to the wall as it's made for smaller gaps) but I've found workarounds, I have a garden fencing covering the outside so they can't get out ( tested his on the slow one first who is very good at escaping but easy to catch, was surprised one evening when I found him hanging out in my room, after 3 updates to the fencing he hasn't escaped yet lol.) I use fleecing now and wash every other day, it only takes me 20 mins or so to clean, restock food & water and add dust to dust bath so I'm super happy. I clean the wood platforms/ metal shelves reasonably often, maybe once or twice a week, if they get dusty I tend to leave it longer as chinchilla dust is expensive and I figured dust doesn't harm them too much. I use glass water bottle and avoid plastic as much as possible. Currently only one has a large ""quiet"" wheel, I need to update the other wheel but am debating different types. I would like to find a thick metal box to hold grass in, might ask a friend to make one, as one chiller has one and the other just has a cheap metal box that seems too light and they push it around too much.  


I used to use paper shaving and cleaned out the cages and it often took an hour to deal with so I look forward to cleaning their cages now since it's so fast! (I always wash the dirty fleece after I swap them out so I have a clean one ready for next time, I don't include fleece wash time since it's not a very activate thing) Fleece also saves me $20 a month on paper bedding I would just throw out. Now if only I could grow them grass lol. I use a biodegradable, safe to eat cleaner as my mom's family is into Shaklee."
getdisciplined,fekhc48,t3_epkgcb,1579200052.0,"I can totally relate, I used to travel a ton for some jobs I had and I hated it, especially driving in bad weather (\*cough\* not a good driver to start with \*cough\*). Got out as fast as possible. Traveling so much left me quite depressed and I was away from friends and family a ton.   


I'm not sure how to improve on your distance to others but maybe there is some way to control your environment better? You actually seem really good at sticking to a habit when you get it started but getting there is the hard part. It sounds to me like you haven't had fun or been able to play for a long time.  


I don't really have good advice though, for me, I knew I felt really alone and felt that what was missing was having more people nearby I could look forward too. What I did was for 6 months go to countless meetups all the time, until I happened to run into someone who was VERY good at getting stuff done in record time. It no longer became a matter of how long something took, it became a matter of what is the simplest way to complete something in 3 days? What helped me was the challenge of working in short bursts. We would do game jams all the time and be like we need x amount of art in 2 days can you do it? I'd be like I have no idea but I'll try! And I learned I could produce work way faster then I realized. While that doesn't help with routines per say, maybe you just need more deadlines to follow through on stuff. Honestly, I'm kinda in the same boat as I work from home, with no boss telling me what to do, learning to be my own boss has been a challenge...   


Another thing that helps is creating an environment you look forward to working in. Like when I work on my art I have a bunch of audiobooks ready so I'm happy to just work there for a while. Those times I don't want to work are hard though, setting a 30 min timer and working through it can help, playing can help (I can become too afraid to ""fail"" at my art which will paralyze me so I have to set aside time to play (play let's you enjoy yourself again, no one cares about failing when they are playing and having fun) you don't have to be perfect when playing! The last thing that helps is people. I'm kinda the type of person that gets quite a lot of motivation from praise (strange I know). Showing off my art and having people like it helps me feel confident to keep making it."

freelance,fek9j3g,t3_epiajd,1579195421.0,"The way I look at it, if I charge more, others can charge more too, I'm helping out not just me but other people. I look to start at fast-food wages and say how much better and more technical my work is from there. When I thought I was charging too much aka $1k+ for my services I was very worried but then I went on fivvr (market research) and found people charging that much and more and I figured hey, others charge that much too. The other thing I consider is I have to eat, I need to make x amount of money if people want my services they need to pay me enough I can eat. So that's how I justify my pricing. As an illustrator though, a looot of people under charge for their services and they bring others down by doing so. Charge more and help everyone. I also consider my hourly wage as a contractor and have to add in extra costs for the those times I'm in between jobs. I also rise my rates as I get more experience, because they are paying for experience too."

DecidingToBeBetter,fclcqts,t3_ehp9az,1577744798.0,"Sometimes, these big and scary problems aren't as big as you think. Just think positive and focus on a good outcome. I'm surprised how much thinking positive actually makes a difference btw.

Work on small sections of it for 30 mins then take a short break, then try again. If you are really struggling ask for a friend or family member to help you stay on task for 30 mins (if time task based) or ask them for encouragement if you are feeling down aka ""I fear drawing because I'm bad at it so I don't want to draw"", sometimes a few kind words can help, sometimes the pressure to be perfect is the problem and in that case you need to allow yourself to be able to fail by playing. Play is the best way to practice different circumstances and experiment with ideas.

If you fear working with people is there something you can do to practice or play with that idea? Is there way to change the environment so you don't have to work with people you don't like etc. Is there a way to reduce your stress with more planning?

Whatever is holding you back is fear, could be fear of disappointment, fear of someone getting anger, fear of something. To tackle that fear write down the best and worst that can happen, talk to others about it, work/expose yourself to that stress in short bursts and give yourself a reward to keep motivated, and just tell yourself, the world won't end if whatever you fear doesn't go right. It's going to be okay."

We hope to perhaps add new content for our game in the springtime and rerelease it. You can check it out RogueCraft Squadron on Steam. You can try the demo out and maybe leave a review."

I just worked from 5pm to 6am on contract work right now and what helped me was actually just working on something easy, seeing that get done then attempting something harder and I was shocked I was able to get unstuck on something that I had been struggling with forever. My brain kinda melted after so many hours though and I could feel my depression pick up. Most of my depression is caused from not eating or sleeping enough and working too much, but if I can eat really well (like 3 full meals) and get like 9 hours of sleep I tend to not be depressed though that is a tricky combo to pull off.

Having completed something beforehand made it easier for me to not stress out about being stuck and I guess that solved one problem. But yeah, I can totally understand depression, I've been working so hard over the holidays it feels like I can't ever escape it. Well, I've been way more depressed before the holidays but just having someone around can help which for me is pretty rare but very nice. I also vote that having people around can make you work harder. Don't underestimate the power your environment & your body has over your mind, it's an easy thing to do."
getdisciplined,fc068yc,t3_ef7rfd,1577280398.0,"I still struggle with this feeling of shame, I still live at home with my mom but recently because I had been so ""successful"" I encouraged her to follow her dreams and she is starting a business with her friends and moving away. I'm terrible sad about it, but I want to help her grow and she has been stuck for a while.

I've been very lost and directionless most of my life, my family is terrible with money and relationships so we are used to being broke, alone and miserable. It takes an intense amount of work to overcome this.
I mean intense, I'm come from a semi-abusive family but they just don't know any better.

With my family's history of divorce and bankruptcy I've felt really behind in a lot of things compared to my piers and moving to a richer state has only had me feel worse overall. It's been hard but I can say I've overcome a lot and understand a lot of why people struggle.

I don't think it's bad to live at home as a single young women but I do feel the shame of not being more successful. I moved away but after my mom divorced she moved in with me and I've worked to encourage her as best I could.

What makes me feel better is I've slowly built up the mentally I take on any job now as a freelancer and that saying no has been my biggest problem.

I mean have 0 idea how to do something but I will figure it out. I've illustrated and helped publish 2 books this year and learned everything painfully by myself, I released a computer game on Steam (after a few years of constantly convincing my friends to keep going and working on it, we all wanted to give up but I got us through it just long enough to get it published), I've run my own business as a freelancer and have hired contract programmers under me (client ran out of funds though...), I worked my way into a programming contract for 7 months last year too so that gave me courage to hire out someone later on for a bigger mobile game project and even though it was cancelled a few months later, my client still wants to work with me later and I gained a lot of experience hiring contractors. That's really hard btw, staying one step ahead of who you hire.

I've worked as a game designer, game artist and programmer. Lately in my freetime I've dabbled in learning how to program cryptocurrency while taking on a branding gig and creating logos and banners for one of my clients, I'll also be building their website for them later. While I feel like a failure like every other day and have struggled with extreme depression, I keep going just I hoping something will click at some point and I'll figure out how to no longer be broke all the time and find clients with money or just do my own thing creating products. I'm a generalist which has been a huge issue for me throughout my life but I like the flexibility it gives me. I like learning on the fly despite the frustration of it. 

Now I went from working at retail positions (that's where I started, just stocking cans) to working hard on being my own boss.

While I always loved school and got good grades I couldn't afford it, and just have an associate degree.
I hope to get both an art degree and computer science degree one day. I know a degree doesn't make a person better per say, but it sure opens doors that have been closed to me. I'm 27 btw, and everyone goes at life at their own pace. Just keeping going and say yes to things you are afraid you can't handle and just try your best... Sometimes, just try, even if it's not your best, just trying is enough. 

Oh, and don't forgot our generation is extremely poor compared to past generations, poverty is to be expected. Forty-one percent of working millennials aren’t eligible for retirement plans through their companies. 300% more student debt, 1/5 in poverty, and you being born into a poor generation you have a lot outside your control. Here are more stats if you want to realize how hard it will be to be like your parents. https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/poor-millennials/"
