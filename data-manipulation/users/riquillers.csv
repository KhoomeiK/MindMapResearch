languagelearning,fdqsfgg,t1_fdqr95o,1578673885.0,"Sorry, I wasn't referring any specific linguistic group (although when I said Nordic I was thinking the north germanic languages which are Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic, and Faroese if I'm not mistaken).

I just meant Swedish and Norwegian really. Danish pronunciation is tricky, Icelandic is closer to old norse than any modern germanic language, and Finnish is very hard and not remotely germanic.

For an English speaker, I think Swedish and Norwegian grammar is much easier more straightforward than French, Spanish or Italian grammar. Grammar isn't everything of course but in my experience Spanish was much harder than Swedish in general."
languagelearning,fdqbay6,t1_fdq2vv7,1578661915.0,"I second this. Breakups can make you lose interest in a lot of things in general. Hope you get better, OP."

Thank you."

languagelearning,fdpx8ww,t1_fdpwbj2,1578644357.0,"As far as learners are concerned yes, natives are all perfect.

Some people aren't satisfied with how they speak even in their native language though. They feel like they aren't very eloquent or they have trouble expressing themselves sometimes.

I sometimes feel like I'm not a native speaker of any language because of where grew up. I might consider spending some time working on my native language."
languagelearning,fdpwsfs,t3_emnfvc,1578643775.0,"I used to say I wanted to perfect every language before moving on to the next one, but I changed my mind.

I'd spent so much time on the old language that I'd begun to progress slower. I was getting diminishing returns. Our relationship was getting stale and it just didn't feel the same anymore. 

Suddenly, a new sexy language walks in, grabs me by the wrist and pulls me to it. I wave my old language goodbye and promise to be back to studying it (at some point). 

The first few weeks were amazing. This new language was full of things to see. Stories, music, culture, funny-sounding words, and quirks of all the sorts to explore. Then 2 weeks later, I begin to lose my motivation as the honey moon ends. I'm faced with the difficult part, and I start to miss the old language a little. It wasn't as exciting but at least it treated me better. Nothing to do now but study I guess.

CasualConversation,fdlcve2,t1_fdlbtxv,1578521312.0,"I found it a lot easier than Spanish, especially the grammar.

Language learning offers the sort of slow, delayed gratification you want when you have a 3 months vacation you don't know how to spend and you want to challenge yourself. I recognize it's not for everyone though so I try not to bore my friends to death talking about it (I could go on for hours)"

When talking about learning words, I think a good distinction to make is between words you can recognize in context (passive vocabulary), and words you can use in a conversation (active vocabulary). Flash cards only train you to recognize a word so it makes sense that you aren't necessarily able to use it. If you wanna get better at speaking you gotta speak a lot."
