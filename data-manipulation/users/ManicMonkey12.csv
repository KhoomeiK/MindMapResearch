depression,ffh7al0,t1_ffh75nc,1579925119.0,Would it be alright if I started a chat with you?
depression,ffh77a3,t1_ffh75nc,1579925042.0,Tomorrow I’m off work. But it won’t matter. It usually never does
depression,ffh714n,t1_ffh6yhx,1579924901.0,The day wasn’t bad actually. It went by fast enough. Tho there was a particular part that thoroughly ruined it for me. I don’t want to talk about that tho
depression,ffh6wtk,t1_ffh6v4w,1579924804.0,Some of us just can’t do it
depression,ffh6t4q,t1_ffh6rdh,1579924719.0,But you don’t know me. How could you possibly possess the ability to care?
depression,ffh6n9x,t1_ffh6m53,1579924583.0,Oh well...
depression,ffh6gvo,t1_ffh6b5b,1579924439.0,But I’m never gonna start. I’m not consistent. I don’t care enough to continue on. I’m content to be the way I am and yet....I’m not. I want to be better but lol never put in the effort. I keep waiting for someone to come to my rescue and say something that’ll change my life but it’s NEVER gonna happen. That doesn’t happen in real life. That’s only in movies. There’s no hope for people like me. I don’t know why I came here.
depression,ffh69cv,t1_ffh64va,1579924270.0,Will it even matter? I’ve talked to over half a dozen therapists and a more than a wise amount of people online. What can anyone do?
depression,ffh61e1,t1_ffh5zcp,1579924094.0,"It doesn’t matter. In the end it doesn’t matter. I’m still never going to change.

hebrew,ff7yq9z,t1_ff7ylpn,1579661550.0,"Hahaha, I would say “Close, but no dice”, however, it is not. The character I’m referring to is a completely original character. It will be an angel."
hebrew,ff7yaun,t1_ff7y64z,1579661247.0,I am not. I’m making a story and in it is some Hebrew I’d like to include for a certain character. His name to be precise.
