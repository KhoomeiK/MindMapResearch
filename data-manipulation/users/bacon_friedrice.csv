But I feel that from my experience, not all cannabis smoke the same.  Some are harsh and feels like a cigarette while other are smooth and very clean tasting.  Is it possible that  there are other chemicals involved?  Perhaps contamination or just grown with too much chemicals.

For example, if I smoke and maintain an active lifestyle; wouldn't that be better than a sedentary lifestyle without smoking?"
UpliftingNews,ff9i6bd,t1_ff9dm1z,1579713540.0,"lmao, are you still reading American Lung Association text from the 90s?

Donald Tashkin's study, funded by the National Institutes of Health's National Institute on Drug Abuse, disproved this myth like a decade ago.   They hypothesized that there would be a positive association between marijuana use and lung cancer, and that the association would be more positive with heavier use. What they found instead was no association at all, and even a suggestion of some protective effect.

Most tokers know that it is not a miracle panacea, they also know it's not as harmful as people made it out to be.  If you say the main consequence of using is addiction/habit forming, a lot of people will agree.

There aren't that many legitimate study on marijuana since it is a schedule 1 substance.  How the experiment was conducted, and who does it?

It is not good to take huge rips on them like you did, those lungs are made for smoking not abuse.

Hard times make hard people, and evolution prefer the hardy species more than the nicer ones.

Although I would not recommend mixing weed with alcohol, that's probably why you're blacking out.  Alcohol opens up your blood vessels so you get a lot higher than you would.  THC also activate your CB2 receptors; which increases alcohol absorption.

Although if you are legitimately trying to break a bad habit, I would recommend magic mushroom.  A proper trip will set you straighter than the straightest straight-edge."

From what I've read, both fish are pretty fucking tasty, especially to Asian people.  It's literally their favorite fish to eat, and it's all organic.  If money can't be made on an abundant resource that we need depleted; imo that's just poor management by the governing body.

nova,fczpwx2,t1_fcxnsod,1578106526.0,"If you haven't already figure out, I am very pro guns.  Many of my friends are gun people.  Gun people are generally the most responsible and decent people, the kind of people you want to live next to.  So we don't have much to disagree on, but you are exhausting to talk to.  Not everything must be a point by point argument or a meltdown, that's not a very good way to exchange ideas.  Which is more effective than arguing, as far as getting people to see your point.  Guns go deep in the U.S, especially in Virginia, there is nobody coming for your guns.  A gun grab literally would start a local civil war.

You keep talking like the integrity of the justice system is failing, just because one prosecutor chose not to waste tax resources in prosecuting a racist and unjust law.  There are things like this all over the legal system.  For example jury nullification or governor's pardon.  You are so blinded by the unreasonable fear of your neighbors taking your pew pew toys from you, while ignoring the tyranny that is the drug war.

If you consider yourself a true American, every fiber of your beings should rebel against tyrannical laws when you see it, even if it doesn't affect you.  If you can't separate real injustice from politics, then there's really no hopes for anyone."

You can still go into any shop in VA today and get a gun, nobody is taking that away, unless you made yourself out to be dangerous or an idiot, then it's a good thing for all of us.  I am not arguing the merit of the 2nd amendment with you.  Why don't you consider the fact that, people who smoke weed are essentially giving up our 2A rights, why don't you defend that.  You can go buy liquor with a pistol strapped on you, but if they find you with weed and gun, it's an instant felony.  I've known people who get drunk and fire off shots in their house; what if it was your kid that catch the stray bullet.

And if you think  getting caught with some weed is like getting a ticket, you're fucking stupid.  That ticket comes with heavy financial burden and possible loss of job; over a fucking plant that doesn't hurt anyone.  This literally affect YOUR community in the worst way.  That person who can't work rely on your taxes.  The person who is locked up is eating up your taxes.

I recommend you go watch some George Carlin Stand ups and maybe learn something.  Politicians are playing you against your own fucking neighbors for their  benefit, and you're falling right into line.  If NRA is about gun rights, they would have said something when a concealed carry permit owner get gunned down by the cop in broad day light.  What happen to enforcing proper gun laws?

People generally do not laws that apply to one color and not the other, that is the real complaint here.  Brody."

First of all.  You are bitching about universal background checks and re-instating a one gun per month law, while complaining that the prosecutor ""pick and choose"" not to enforce a racist and injustice law that affect somebody's life more so than having to wait a few days to buy a second AR15.  Take a minute to reflect on how fucked up that is.

You remember back in the days where they had a law that said it was legal for a white man to kill an escaping slave; and they also wrote laws that say black people can't own guns or weapons.  Apparently there were a bunch of people that picked and chose not to follow that law anymore, and that's how we are here."

Sometimes I think they are right; we can't even treat other humans properly, how can we even dream of fixing the planet and all it's creatures.  At the current wealth disparity we have in the world, can you blame the bottom 30 percent for doing what ever the fuck they want to the planet to get out of that bracket? All for the benefit of the top 10 at the end of the day.

George Carlin said it best, the power that is behind all of this mess doesn't give a fuck about you or the burning koalas, they just want to be the richest and stay there.  And because all of us play a long with this dumb game, the planet is just heating up so it can reshuffle around the elements and start something new.  As It has been doing this for billions of years.

I think the only solution is the abandon the tribal mentality and work together as a global community to make sure we can take care of the poorest among us; and the problem will fix itself in the long run.  We have the technology and the resources to do it.

This change will never happen, because the winners of the current game will not want to stop playing until the end game.  So they are going to keep hoarding wealth at all costs, like a cancerous cell that can't stop feeding until the host no longer welcome them to stay."
