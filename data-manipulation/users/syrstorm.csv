teslamotors,fffoqbs,t1_fff4jd2,1579888505.0,This is a GREAT summary.
teslamotors,fffon82,t1_ffeyzsb,1579888453.0,"Anyone that says they know the answer is full of it, and wants something from you. Having said that, I personally believe that buying after a big run like this isn't a great idea. Generally there's a ""correction"" back towards the starting numbers from a month ago. But of course we don't know - this could be the correction, or it could just keep going."
teslamotors,fffo976,t1_ffeopux,1579888216.0,"That's why I said ""may have"". It feels to me like the big run has slowed down, but that could just be my impression. There are legitimate numbers that suggest that the stock is overpriced right now, but those numbers are based on methods for evaluating standard (old) car companies - that just means that there's more downwards pressure on the stock. I still agree with Ark Invest's overall analysis and believe it's going to 10x (or more) from the current numbers... but that it's a long term play to prove that it's the best EV company, not a short term one."
LiverpoolFC,ffe7bo0,t3_et0opc,1579838638.0,"Whew. Good timing, then. Let Divock and Minamino get some run, then and let him rest up."
teslamotors,ffe55xm,t1_ffe203k,1579836975.0,"Yep. It's certainly been nice owning some the last 3-4 months. That's for sure. It may have leveled off for a while at this new price point, but I completely agree that the future looks VERY bright."
videos,ffd3dcf,t3_ess6vn,1579812621.0,"Yes. The judge is corrupt. Duh.

I'm bothered by the cop, too - there's clearly no reason to pull him over, but the cop wants to flex his authority. He wants to show up the guy who DARED to honk their horn at him, until he finds out that it's someone with a bigger hammer than his, and he has to step down. They're both out of line, here."
happycrowds,ffcltup,t1_ffbdyp0,1579802193.0,"U.S. hockey beating the Soviets in the 1980 Winter Olympics. Buster Douglas and Rulon Gardner upsets were pretty massive, but not quite on the same scale, then add the geopolitical situation on top of things and the hockey upset is even more stunning. Leicester winning the EPL was more unlikely, but isn't really an upset since it took place over a whole season rather than being a single matchup."
happycrowds,ffclogi,t1_ffbm0dg,1579802104.0,"That's the most unlikely event, but an upset is generally a single match that goes to the underdog(s)."
GalaxysEdge,ff6u9g1,t3_ervznp,1579635005.0,"Damn, that looks good. I've been considering going back for a 2nd saber and I was planning to do Protection/Defense (love Old Republic!), but that build is making me reconsider..."

Homebrewing,feg37ll,t1_fef3uue,1579074926.0,"Dude, we used to play EVERY DAY after work in the back room of our offices. 8 players, 4 xbox, 4 screens - all linked together. Must have put in 20k hours at least. The best."
escaperooms,feg0tbx,t1_fefy8ql,1579072093.0,60 Out does something similar and it works well.
escaperooms,feg0ssv,t3_eoqdmk,1579072077.0,"Ask yourself why you want to add the challenge. For the examples you listed I can't imagine that any fun has been added to the room that comes close to the amount that would be removed for some people. 

Don't get me wrong - there's tons of puzzles out there that not everyone can complete. Hell, nearly every room I've ever been to has used color for puzzles which couldn't be solved by color blind people. Or ""physical"" puzzles that require a certain amount of eye/hand coordination to complete successfully - also can be very fun!

Just be sure that anything you're adding is with a purpose towards entertaining people."

GalaxysEdge,fdt2ymr,t1_fdt2jur,1578711235.0,Of course. Just wanted to be super clear for anyone reading.

escaperooms,fdmo4wf,t3_em0qh0,1578557622.0,"Here's a pretty common approach, and then a few tips:

What you're looking for are puzzles and clues. Your goal is to solve puzzles, and you'll use the clues in the room to do that.

A 4 digit padlock? That's a puzzle (find 4 numbers and arrange them in the correct order). A list of presidents? That's a clue (maybe arrange their birth years in alphabetical order?). When you first enter the room or unlock a new area - search the whole place and call out any puzzles/locks that you find FIRST. That way you'll all know what to be on the lookout for. 

General hints:
1. Keep an eye out for anything that could represent an order - colors, alphabetical, geographical - whatever. 

2. Anything feels slightly out of place or unusual - 90% chance that there's a reason.

3. Often you won't have all of the clues you need to solve a particular puzzle. Don't be afraid to set it current clues aside and come back when you have more info or gain more clues.

4. Especially for your first room, don't be even slightly afraid to ask for a clue if you're feeling stumped. Spend a couple minutes trying to figure it out for yourself, of course - but don't let yourselves get frustrated. Get the clue, solve the puzzle and move on to more fun clues and puzzles!

5. Nothing will require force - a pinkie's worth of pressure should be enough to move/open/adjust anything that needs it. Strength isn't required."

teslamotors,fdmn4hy,t3_em2p27,1578556359.0,YES. Please.
pics,fdltdwn,t1_fdl3rbf,1578532044.0,"Thank you for this. It can be REALLY easy to wonder about this stuff. It's good to know that 99% of the people out there just want to live, love, be safe, and be happy."
TeslaModel3,fdlt39y,t1_fdle8tf,1578531843.0,"Yeah, that bit around the cup holders was definitely the hardest. The rest wasn't too bad."
aww,fdif2t2,t3_elhjpf,1578441457.0,So much emotion. Awesome.
boardgames,fdie79h,t1_fdhnmkc,1578440892.0,"Example #2821345 why private equity firms are an f'ing scourge. Only thing that matters is short term profits - generally selling/gutting companies, regardless of the effect on employees, customers, etc."
politics,fdexua1,t1_fdews0v,1578348892.0,"But without letting him be in the room for it. I can't help but think ""Without ME?"" could be part of this new announcement."
LosAngelesRams,fdexcym,t3_ekylii,1578348594.0,"You da' man, coach. You're a great football guy, and a terrific human. You were an important part of one of the great football turnaround stories of the last few decades. You'll be missed."
pics,fdcuuxq,t1_fdcaaqb,1578284969.0,Yep. I'd already downvoted the post. Just forgot to go back and delete my response.
LosAngelesRams,fdc3zut,t1_fdbz5uu,1578266658.0,Yes. That's cheating. They should be punished by the league. But that's not as evil as trying to hurt players.
LosAngelesRams,fdc15ds,t1_fdbv8fc,1578265085.0,"That's cheating to win, not cheating to hurt people. The football gods are more lenient about that."
LosAngelesRams,fdbsgny,t3_ekj9jh,1578261268.0,Still cursed since Bountygate. Perhaps the most well deserved curse in sports.
Games,fd758x2,t1_fd5k3v4,1578199596.0,"Well, that's a whole other discussion. The cost to MAKE games has gone up 10x in the last decade while the cost to BUY games hasn't increased in that same time - since consumers seem unwilling to pay more up front for their games, publishers and developers have to recoup their increased costs somehow which is why we see so many instances of microstransactions and other post-purchase options for games. 

Games aren't getting any cheaper to make, and remain one of the greatest values in existence for price to time spent among the various entertainment industries."
TeslaModel3,fd5c6pl,t3_ek31pp,1578176152.0,"Near the original? No. That's far too optimistic. But it will be worth more than other cars in that price range bought the same year (EVs don't break down as much), so you'll get a pretty good return. There's also the possibility that the Tesla robo-taxi fleet will be a thing by then - if that happens then a TM3 with FSD will be worth quite a bit."
Games,fd5bgfa,t3_ek18oe,1578175977.0,Because people mentally use the same scoring scale that is used in school testing where anything about a 90 is great and anything below a 70 is horrific.
fantasyfootball,fcz0yp6,t3_ejgxyh,1578091479.0,"The version we used to play in what used to be my favorite league was ""knockout fantasy"" - you pick a lineup each week, but can't use any player you've already used during the playoffs. Highest combined score through the playoffs wins. Great fun and very tough strategy decisions since you can lock yourself out of a decent team in the Superbowl or even the championship games if you pick players who keep winning. The ideal player is one who goes crazy, but their team loses."
pics,fcyzv7z,t3_ejgiuz,1578090770.0,That's so good.
theouterworlds,fcvbvl0,t1_fcusr9j,1577998847.0,"Nope, it didn't. You're good."
theouterworlds,fcvbsq7,t3_ej0d8k,1577998801.0,"20 hours is *possible* on a first playthrough, but not how most people play. 20 hours is far more likely on a second playthrough where you're skipping dialogs, skipping questlines, etc."
TeslaModel3,fcvbdnk,t1_fcuk8fi,1577998554.0,"Frankly, because they have so few moving parts, EVs don't break down as much and hold their value pretty well. It sounds like you have a good argument for making the change to EV now - and if you want the Cybertruck later you'll still get a lot of value for your Model 3."
TeslaModel3,fcvb5b1,t1_fcv2srn,1577998417.0,"Yes, this would be my recommendation. None of the TM3s from 2018 will have the FSD hardware (upgraded chipset), so you might as well just enjoy EAP for now and then do that upgrade after it launches if the reviews are good."
aww,fcq1h16,t3_eiaj5y,1577876686.0,You rock. That's amazing.
AskReddit,fcmjkim,t3_ehquh9,1577777892.0,This is one of those dumb questions you ask in high school to make yourself feel smart. There's no way to do this that doesn't allow the government to take control of people's genitalia. It's a horrific idea.
teslamotors,fcmi4t0,t3_eht2nb,1577776192.0,"Yes. Completely. I do enjoy accelerating away from red lights, but I don't really bother speeding anywhere, and you're 100% right - with autopilot I just don't care about heavy traffic that much any more. I just set the AP and just chill with the tunes going."

LiverpoolFC,fc3u6au,t1_fc3srbh,1577398718.0,I watched the replay like 6 times. Did Joe even TOUCH him? I'm not joking - I couldn't find an angle where it was anything other than Vardy cutting back and falling over his own feet.
TeslaModel3,fbrzos8,t1_fbqfyac,1577048277.0,"Yeah, but it doesn't feel like the Tesla was specifically targeted - they'd have hit any car they were going past. Just assholes."
