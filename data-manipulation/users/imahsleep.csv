This draft does not fit the meta at all, you want to win lanes. 4 of the picks were fine but arc warden doesn’t fit with sparks timing, laning or play style.

Next time I’ll have to spell things out for thick people like you.

agedlikemilk,ff77s0s,t1_ff77q2z,1579642795.0,Idk where you got that from... I’m talking about Bernie not being extreme. Trump and centrists are the ones who are on the wrong side of history atm
agedlikemilk,ff76vef,t1_ff7541h,1579642289.0,Voting for someone who stands for actually helping people isn’t an extreme. It’s the right thing to do. We have plenty of resources in the US we just use them poorly... maybe a little less war and a little less lobbying would be good for us.

DotA2,feyz21b,t1_feyymu0,1579452260.0,"... you have two matches to start, then as soon as one ends you have a 5 minute break and the next match is up. The space and flexibility of of having only two at once and having the others waiting and ready to start is what would cut down on break time. The long breaks are because they have 4 set ups and have to clear them out and then the new teams in. With two teams playing they can be prepping to go before the other teams even finished. Most majors don’t take 15-20 minutes between group matches, this isn’t a new concept bud. It also means you can catch way more games."
DotA2,feyxm3g,t1_feyxbz7,1579451688.0,"... the reason I’m upset is because I’m missing 3/4 of the games, the root of the problem is that 4 matches start at once and this leads to my complaint that there was nothing on for 15 minutes, it’s all related mate"

Then there’s usually 2 loader, 1 loading supervisor, with a minimum of 1 loader and 1 loading supervisor.  Do y’all have a lot of ethylene storage, I’m use to getting in a pipeline, seems like you’d have to have a huge tank to not run out in a couple of days if you had a medium-big plant.

The EO really isn’t even the scariest part of an EO plant though, one of the feeds is pure oxygen which can cause an explosion with just a small little dust size particle and burn stainless steel, in this scenario the stainless steel is the fuel source. it’s a dangerous plant so usually there are a ton of safeguards, mainly a SIS.  Also increasing pressure keeps it liquid (raise the temp required for it to boil). Think saturated steam temp rising with pressure."
