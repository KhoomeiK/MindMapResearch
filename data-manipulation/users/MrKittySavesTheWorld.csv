I mean, come on.  
The whole thing has to be BS anyway; I never get ads online for anything I would consider buying, or that’s even tangentially related to anything else I do/search for, and definitely never the whole “I talked about something and then got ads for it” thing.  
They’re almost always for shit that I have a hard time imagining ANYONE buying, let alone me.  
Political ads are always for candidates/the party that I consistently express open disdain for, so that’s wrong.  
They can’t get my taste in ANYTHING remotely correct; not music, not hobbies and interests, or the types of problems I have.  
I mean, if they ARE doing something, they’re sucking so badly at it, it’s a total waste.
