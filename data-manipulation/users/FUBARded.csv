kelowna,ffyyekm,t3_evyljd,1580358356.0,"Yes and no, as others have said. 

There are only 2 real segregated bike/multi-use pathways in the Mission Creek Greenway (~10km of mild gravel) and the Okanagan Rail Trail (50km when completed, but currently 15km paved and 25km mild gravel with a road section connecting the two).

The network of bike lanes is pretty good and covers almost all major roads, and drivers are courteous *for the most part* wherever there aren't bike lanes.  There is a fair share of aggressive or completely clueless drivers who run lights and turn aggressively without checking for bikes though, so you definitely have to be vigilant when riding on the road.  There's also a lot of beautiful lanes outside and between the cities to ride, although again you have to exercise caution as the few cars that are up and about there tend to drive like maniacs.  You can do decently long rides without leaving a bike lane for too long, although it is nice to venture out into the lanes where there aren't as many stop lights to interrupt or intersections to navigate.

If you ride MTB, the trails on Knox are supposedly pretty good and super easily accessible from downtown (5-15min ride).  There's also a bunch of lift access parks within a couple hours drive, so it may just be one of the best places in the country to live as a mountain biker short of Whistler itself in terms of access to great riding."

BrandNewSentence,ffsnjqo,t1_ffqqi8u,1580186317.0,"Just like most mental disorders, it's a very individual condition.

I was personally diagnosed as a kid (5 or 6yrs old) and was on medication for a couple of years.  The doctors just couldn't find the right dosages for me, so the medication seemed to either do nothing or countered it by making me a zombie, which was obviously counter productive as it just meant I went from being hyperactive and unable to pay attention in school to being lethargic and unable to pay attention in school.

Aged 10 or so we decided to stop the medication, and while it was sometimes difficult, it's possible to work without it and I found that it definitely got better/easier to counter with age.  Nowadays I still display many of the behaviours associated with ADHD (difficulty focusing on a task for too long, inability to sit still, weird memory lapses, etc.), but these are for the most part  easy to counter through changing behaviours/habits and establishing routines, making more detailed plans, etc.

If you think you have it, go to a doctor and talk to them (I think a GP/family doctor should be able to diagnose it or refer you to a psychologist/psychiatrist/therapist if not).  They're the ones who can help with some medication and/or therapy, not strangers on the internet who have little information and no context.  Even should the efficacy of any treatments prove to be low for you (always a possibility with mental disorders unfortunately), simply having that relatively concrete diagnosis can make a world of difference."

bicycling,ffk5wtf,t1_ffjlhjs,1580016912.0,"The only plausible explanation for the spokes to be uniformly covered over their entire length up to the hub is that the rider went straight into a super deep puddle (which they couldn't possibly be riding through), pulled the bike out, and snapped this photo.  There's no way this is accumulation purely from riding on a muddy road.

If it was accumulation from actually riding the mud covering wouldn't be nearly as uniform, with there being visible streaking on the rim where the mud is slowly being pushed out by the centrifugal force.

The fact that they're just brushed aside completely or in this case given a sentence equivalent to that given for super minor offences like unpaid parking tickets is ridiculous.

As you said, it's reflective of the ridiculous notion that drivers don't have responsibility for their actions, and that any harm that comes to other road users/pedestrians/bystanders is equally or even more their fault than that of the person operating the vehicle.  Hell, people frequently get much harsher punishments than this for accidental maimings or killings on job/construction sites, but you stick the at-fault party in a vehicle and the victim on a bike and suddenly they get off basically scott-free.

I suppose it makes sense to keep one stuffed at the back of a saddle bag for a rainy day, but otherwise it makes little sense to me to use a super expensive product which is advertised on the basis of its light weight (lightweight | durable, choose one).  You could buy more than 10 bog standard tubes for the price of a single tubolito if you buy in bulk, and regular tubes can be patched and kept alive forever which I don't think the tubolito can do.  

Unless you're *really* intent on losing those grams or *really* love the way they ride, they just make little to no sense to me outside the aforementioned emergency situation where having a tube that folds into nothing is a godsend simply due to the cost.

bicycling,ffejdfj,t3_et6aqu,1579850421.0,"The major difference with cycling-specific lights is that they're focused and directed in such a way that maximises illumination of where you need to see, while minimising the likelihood that you blind oncoming traffic.

For a (presumably lightly trafficked) dirt road you should be fine using a headlamp, but ideally you'd have a decent cycling-specific headlight to ensure that the beam is sufficiently thrown and focused that you can see where you're going.  Unless your headlamps are super powerful, their beam throw and focus probably isn't great for cycling, meaning they'll probably really illuminate your immediate vicinity, but do little to illuminate the >10-15m ahead of you that you need when at speed.  As others have mentioned, if you're riding somewhere with vehicular traffic you really should only use a cycling-specific headlight pointed at the road.  Beyond a dim strobe or something to draw attention you shouldn't have a light on your head as the potential for accidentally blinding someone at an inopportune time is high."
bicycling,ffeiwsm,t3_et4vdc,1579849863.0,"I can vouch for Tiagra being pretty damn good for the money, and since I don't have experience with Rival I think the Hatchet wins by virtue of having an extra gear in terms of groupset.

TRP spyre's are really good for mechanical disc brakes, but hydraulic > mechanical 98% of the time, so the VR40 wins there.

To me, the Devinci looks like the slightly better spec for the price.  More versatility as it accepts tyres up to 40C, easier gearing if you want to do any off-road/gravel riding (looks like it comes with a 11-42, while the biggest cassette Tiagra can handle is 11-34 IIRC), and the fender mounts are also a nice touch if you ever want to commute on it.

Ride both if you can as spec is a moot point if you buy something that doesn't fit.  If you could do 30-35km/h on your old bike, either of these will do the same just fine.  If you get the Devinci and plan on riding predominantly on smooth pavement you may want to get some thinner tyres for it though, which you may want to factor into your budget.

FWIW, I got my bike for basically the same price as the VR40 but with TRP Spyre's, and would've gone with a bike like the Devinci if I had the chance to go back now.  I love my bike, but being limited to 28mm tyres is a PITA as I enjoy the occasional gravel ride (and fatter tyres are only marginally slower, but much more comfortable even on pavement).  I also would've loved to do some light singletrack/trail riding which I could've done on a bike like the Devinci with its 40mm tyres that just aren't doable on my 25's.  It's generally better to get an all-rounded (gravel) bike and then modify it for your specific needs as then you have options, whereas I went with the endurance bike which is great at what it's designed for, but not nearly as adaptable (primarily constrained by tyre clearance and gearing).

TL;DR - Very similar bikes, but the Devinci slightly edges out on spec, and is far more versatile.  Only downside to the Devinci is the extra $100, slightly inferior brakes, and that you may want to get thinner tyres at first (although having 40C's could come in useful if you ever want to do trail/gravel riding or something so it's not like you'd be throwing them away)."
bicycling,ffehyda,t3_et1m0t,1579848730.0,"You'll be fine.

As /u/3j0hn mentioned, you just really want to get as much riding volume in as possible, and make it as specific as possible.  String together rides on back to back days to make sure you can recover, and make sure to do 4-6hr rides to make sure you can cope with that time in the saddle.

This [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIf1xvRN8pzyd_VfLgj_dow) has some great science-based training and nutrition recommendations that I'd recommend watching if you have the time.  If you don't want to bother with super structured training though, I honestly think you'd be just fine if you get more volume in over the next 5 months.  

Since you're not racing and the distances involved are relatively long, you're going to spend most of the event at your endurance to threshold level efforts.  You'd be training that endurance system (albeit not particularly efficiently) if you just continue to do those 50km/day, 2x/week rides at a moderate steady state intensity.  Easy intervals to incorporate to push up your threshold power (assuming you don't have a power meter) would be 10-30min near-maximal blocks.

For example:

 * 10-15min easy pace warm up
 * 10min at a hard steady state (difficult but doable for the 10mins)
 * Rest 5min
 * Repeat x2
 * Finish up the ~50km or whatever you have time for at an easy-moderate pace

That's a somewhat crude but pretty easy to implement training session that should kick your ass and drive your FTP up.  It's also easy to scale and modify as you can add more repetitions with the same durations, or increase the working duration to 20-40min depending on what you need.  Specificity is key, so if the course route is biased toward 10min climbs you'd be better off continuing to do those, but if it has 30-60min climbs you need to be doing 30-60min efforts in training.

So if you just wanna ride 3x per week:

 * Day 1 - FTP building session similar to the above
 * Day 2 - Shorter and sharper efforts to train your VO2 Max and anaerobic systems (30s to ~5min efforts, but make sure to keep your work:rest to at least 1:2 to start off on 3-8min VO2 efforts, and give yourself at least 10min between <1min maximal anaerobic efforts; these really tax the muscles).

 * Day 3 (weekend?) - Long steady state ride (4-7hrs or however long you expect each stage of the event to take on average, but just try to get as many miles in at an easy-moderate pace).

Day 2 here isn't strictly *necessary* for your purposes, but it'll definitely make you faster and more well-rounded.  Those sessions are hard though, so just sticking to the typical ~50km easy-moderate pace and just doing the 1 threshold session per week should suffice.

Tacking on an extra 30-120mins at the end of the sessions on days 1 and 2 when possible would also work, but you'd have to be careful to watch your recovery and gradually ramp up to that as I'm guessing structured training itself is a new stimulus.

As I said, if you can't be fucked doing all this, just ride as much as you can.  The more mileage you have in the saddle, the easier and more fun the event will be.  Good luck!"
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffe36os,t1_ffdg8jz,1579835502.0,"That's because you're looking at it like a workout.  What it sounds like is that this lady is just going for a quick jog or something upon waking up to get the blood pumping and some feel-good endorphins to start the day.  If she's an avid runner a mile at a leisurely pace probably wouldn't phase her and wouldn't be much of a workout at all unless she was going all-out or doing some sprints or something, which I doubt anybody would want to do soon after waking up and immediately prior to heading to work anyway.

You can absolutely get a good workout in <3 miles provided you're not training for an event longer than that, in which case you'd need more low intensity volume.

bicycling,ffe2453,t1_ffdi5zc,1579834708.0,"Drop bars are compatible with anything that has a stem that can clamp to them.  The geometry isn't really relevant as you can adjust the fit with the stem, bar angle, shifter position, etc.  It's the same story with a saddle; just find something that fits you and slap it on there.  You may need to get a new seatpost if the existing one's clamping mechanism doesn't fit the saddle you choose, but that's just a matter of making sure the seat post is the appropriate diameter for the frame.

One thing to keep in mind is that you'd need to get STI levers for use with the drop bars unless you're okay with only having braking and shifting on the ""tops"" (the flat section on the top of drop bars).  Depending on the groupset on your bike you can either directly swap the existing thumb shifters for STI levers, or you may have to go out and get a new groupset.  That could either be a PITA, or pretty expensive depending on what you currently have unfortunately, but I'm not familiar with groupset compatibility of that era so I'm not entirely sure.

If you're just after more hand positions or a more aggressive riding position, a cheaper and easier alternative could be to get a flat stem (or flip the current stem) as it looks like that bike comes with a pretty steep riser stem, and add bar-ends.  The lower bar position with a 0° stem or what you currently have flipped will provide a more aggressive riding position, with the bar ends providing more hand position options and leverage when needed."

peloton,ffalzyt,t1_ffac4y2,1579739082.0,"Exactly this.  The supplement industry is *very* poorly regulated.  In many places it's worse regulated than food, and it's much less closely monitored than medicine everywhere.  Ingredient lists can often be misleading or even outright false, and the stated quantities of each substance are seldom precise.

My guess as to what happens in these cases is that athletes take precise dosages aiming to maximise performance that in theory put them right under the legal limit for a given substance, trusting those labels that we all know have *huge* margins of error.  Supplements are poorly regulated, but unless they're getting really bottom of the shelf shady shit there shouldn't be enough in the way of contaminants or error in the quantities to put them above the legal limits with regular doses.  They have to be really pushing the dosing (or using this excuse as a cover up) for it to happen so frequently.

As you said, they're professional athletes who obviously have a very strong interest in not breaking the rules and losing their livelihoods.  Instead of trying to optimise with off-the-shelf supplements (and probably getting creative with dosing), they should go to their fucking team doctors and ask for a prescription medication/medical grade supplement that they can trust the ingredients and quantities of said ingredients of.

Take Betsema for example.  She went to a doctor for some issue, and apparently unknowingly got herself prescribed a banned substance.  Why the fuck would she not take the UCI/WADA list of banned substances and make sure the pharmacist is aware of them?  I brought up a relatively high level competition I was training for at the doctor once, and he asked me if I would be drug tested before prescribing me a bunch of steroid medication (for bad bronchitis and something else).  If that's all it took for my doctor to ask when I didn't even explicitly bring it up as I didn't think of it, why the hell isn't a professional athlete making sure that theirs is aware when they do actually get drug tested??  I'm sure few pharmacists are aware of the exact guidelines, but it's a relatively simply matter to make sure both one's doctor and pharmacist are aware that you're being drug tested and for what, as then it's just a matter of them looking up the composition of whatever's being prescribed and ensuring it falls within the limits.  

The onus is on them 100% considering that most pros have easy access to *at least* 2 doctors who should have an intimate knowledge of the WADA/UCI guidelines in the form of their pro team and national team doctors.  I'd be a tiny bit more sympathetic if they were independent athletes fending for themselves who were overly trusting of a label (still on them, but more forgiveable), but a WT level rider has no excuse."

My city barely cares about cyclists and pedestrians, but recently approved far more money than this to create a 50kn multi-use pathway.  You best believe that the only reason they did so was because an economic impact study showed that it'd pay for itself within a couple of decades through allowing for easier expansion of the city, increased accessibility to goods and services in the city from people who live on the outskirts, more movement between neighbouring cities, and by slightly reducing the burden on the roads.  

If my city could justify the expenditure, an incredibly popular tourist destination like anywhere on the cliffs of Dover would stand to make far more money.    It's also ridiculous to assert that a feature like this doesn't add value for a tourist or someone visiting for the day.  Would you rather see the cliffs of Dover from a parking lot by the side of a motorway, or use a path like this?  I'm sure there's plenty of trails in the area, but something like this is far more accessible and attractive, and would likely lead to more people making a day out of it (and thus spending more money in the area) rather than just driving up, taking a couple of photos, and leaving like many do."

I've seen some people say that the likes of Alaphillipe and the Jumbo Visma guys were playing it tactically and would've been able to catch up once they actually started working, but the reality was that they were all together initially, but cracked under Bernal's pressure.  He's shown himself to probably be the best climber in the world on long steep climbs at altitude, so while Alaphillipe deserves a lot of credit for defending yellow for so long, it was all but a lost cause considering Bernal's strengths and the fact that Alaphillipe hadn't been pacing himself nearly as conservatively up to that point.

If he went into it targeting GC instead of stage hunting in the first week before finding himself in yellow, it just may have been possible for him to pull it off considering how late he cracked.

If anything, Yates was the real loser on that stage as it's entirely possible he could've won another considering that Bernal would've been going for time and Yates has a much better kick.  Even Bernal lost out on the chance to contest for that, and the possibility of a more dominant GC win.

bicycling,fewrp8t,t1_fewn2oh,1579418493.0,"To me, yeah.  Why would someone sell a $2500 pair of wheels like that for $900?  It's not exactly a low end wheelset that they'd want to get rid of after having upgraded (unless they're super rich), so pricing it as if they really want to get rid of it ASAP seems suspicious.  I'm not familiar with the used market for such high end components, but I imagine with only 3000km on them they could go for *at least* $1500, if not closer to $2000 unless they depreciate a lot quicker than I think.

Maybe ask if you can get them inspected at a bike shop or something?  If they're pricing it like they want the wheels gone but are unwilling to have an expert take a look at them, it may indicate that there's something wrong with them to warrant the low price (and which may warrant an even lower price).

Could it perhaps be a listing for only one of the wheels?  They go for [$1100 and $1400](https://rovalcomponents.com/products/roval-clx-50?variant=29500711885) for the front and rear respectively, either of which would make a lot more sense to sell for $900 than both..."

I don't know about you, but I would *much* rather get a nice bike that can be ridden anywhere, and have money left over than getting a bulky and heavy stationary bike.

$2245 can go a long way:

 * ~$1500 for a disc brake, 105 equipped, alloy framed road bike (or entry-level hardtail MTB)
 * ~$500 for an entry level smart trainer
 * ~$100 for a spare monitor or something if you want to watch stuff and don't already have something handy (or fans, table, mat for the floor, etc. if you don't need an extra screen)
 * ~$145 should cover at least a year's subscription for any major virtual training platform (e.g. Zwift, Sufferfest, TrainerRoad, etc.)

To me, a product like the Peloton only really makes sense in a gym or other communal-use setting.  Anybody who just wants a simple exercise machine to keep at home would be better off spending a lot less money on a more basic stationary bike, or put that money toward getting an actual bike + indoor training setup.  If you're spending all that money to get the features it offers, you may as well get an actual bike + smart trainer which offers many of the same features, plus the obvious ability to ride outdoors.

To think that someone can just train for a few months and beat one of the best current practitioners of the sport they're new in is ridiculous, even if the newbie is a high level athlete in a similar sport.

Once you get to the level these guys are at in their sport, the level of specificity required in their training is extremely high.  Sure, McGregor would obviously have a leg up over someone new to combat sports in general as he'll already have stuff like the mechanics of punching down and very good reflexes and explosivity, but differences in stuff like foot work, body positioning, the gloves, length of the rounds, etc. are all factors that will severely confound his performance relative to someone who's been training with all those things in mind for decades.

Mayweather's training had been specific to boxing for decades, while McGregor's had been for months.  He'd have been a lot closer to Mayweather's level than a non-combat sport athlete who retrained on a similar timeline by virtue of having experience in a similar sport, but they're different enough sports that a few months of retraining is wholly insufficient to hope to be on a level equivalent to where McGregor was in MMA.

gifsthatkeepongiving,felyhfi,t1_felgch4,1579234181.0,"It's because fitness ""influencers"" post ridiculous exercises, programmes, diets, and recovery modalities that are all somehow that ""one weird trick"" to getting fit/jacked/toned/whatever buzz word, which far too many people fall for.

In a world where there is clear scientific consensus on many things (or at the very least consensus on what *doesn't* work if the most optimal approach is debatable), the easiest way to make money is to pretend said consensus doesn't exist, and drown it out with crazy shit that looks weird or amazing to the untrained or inexperienced person, which they then erroneously emulate thinking these ""influencers"" actually do half the things they show.

Think of all the batshit crazy stuff that gets upvoted to the front page of reddit on a regular basis; people backflipping with weights, (bench) pressing women, the myriad of shit involving balance implements, among other things.  These feats may be impressive from a performance standpoint, but no serious athlete does *any* of this shit for any reason other than to impress people on social media who don't know better, because the risk:reward is so clearly not worth it in terms of the practicality of whatever they're doing, and the often very high injury risk.    An easy example that comes to mind is that one idiot got onto the front page a couple of times in the last few months doing handstand pushups on a 2-2.5m high stack of dumbbells balanced on one another.  Sure, it's an impressive feat of strength and balance, but that isn't something *anybody* should be doing outside the fucking circus.  Most people will see that for what it is; a stunt intended to garner attention, but there'll always be that impressionable kid or someone who just doesn't know better thinking that handstand pushups on unstable implements is a good idea (which it isn't, obviously).

I guarantee that the fitness ""influencers"" who post weird and unsubstantiated exercise variations (including the ones that probably inspired many in this video), programmes, supplements, diets, etc. don't actually use them and are just doing it to garner attention or due to a sponsorship/affiliate deal.  They most likely follow relatively standard protocols, *because that's what we know works empirically*.  It's just that well structured, progressively overloaded, and appropriately periodised training programmes with goal-specific exercise selection made with sensible cost/benefit analysis just isn't as sexy for mass audience reach who care less about the minutiae and more about what looks impressive.

He did this consistently for most of the last school term at least 3 days per week for 15-30mins before leaving.  He may still be doing it for all I know, but I don't go at the same time anymore.

He doesn't take his jacket off or get changed into workout clothes, and unless he's walking around with a weighted backpack just has a laptop and maybe some textbooks in there.  Man's paying good money to do something that could literally be done anyplace that he can stand, and I just don't understand it.

People who have seemingly never been exposed to or are incapable of observing what appropriate gym attire is seem almost pedestrian next to this guy, although there is a weirdly large number of them.  I also saw a guy yesterday who was in jeans deadlifting off the floor *in a rack*, which was new and utterly incomprehensible considering that the gym was super busy, people were waiting for the rack, and the deadlift platform/mat was free."
mildlyinfuriating,fefi4q5,t1_fef2bln,1579056802.0,"OP mentioned in another comment that there were no open permits for this neighbours address, so I'm guessing they probably didn't bother with making sure it's up to code..."
BrandNewSentence,feehjg2,t1_fedblzq,1579033878.0,"I don't think a little heat will make a guy infertile unless it's hot enough to do real damage (which should hurt).

It may kill the sperm cells present at the time and make them inert, but if there's no damage to the testes themselves that's irrelevant unless you want that specific load to impregnate a woman, as the inert cells will just be replaced by live ones.  I don't know the exact timeline but sperm cell production is a continuous process, meaning that slightly excessive heat on the balls will most likely just temporarily reduce sperm count, which should return to normal in a matter of days or maybe even hours.

FWIW I'm not a urologist, but this is my intuition based on my admittedly limited knowledge.

I don't understand how these people are using their laptops for any significant heat to be on the balls in the first place anyway.  A vast majority of laptops are hottest at around the hinge, which would be at around the middle of the quadricep even if someone was using their laptop with it wedged into the crease of their hip for some reason.  That's just a really weird and unergonomic position to use a laptop, with a much more sensible position being with the edge of the laptop at the mid-quad and hinge at the knee or hanging just over, where typing is easier, the vents on the bottom and/or in the hinge have better airflow, and there's no heat on the balls.  A table is still obviously the best option, but for someone to do real damage they'd have to be using their laptop in a really weird way IMO."
miband,fecyg32,t1_fecwq7u,1578989810.0,"Hmm yeah, my inclination would be that whatever processed the data is what messed up.

You could record the activity with Mi's service and on another app on your phone (e.g. Ride with GPS, Wahoo Fitness, MapMyRide, Strava etc.) concurrently, then compare them.

I don't think it'd be an issue with the initial GPS lock, as whenever that's happened to me the initial track is just all wonky, but behaves as expected once the signal is acquired.  What's happened with your activity looks like it's recorded the correct track, but somehow translated it or overlaid it incorrectly on the map.  

Remember that it's simply logging GPS coordinates and not ""snapping"" to roads on a map like you'd be used to from constructing routes or looking for directions, so for the track to be of the right shape but in the wrong location indicates that it's more likely a processing/overlay issue rather than a GPS error as you said.

It's also possible that your phone was on battery saver or something that reduces the GPS polling frequency, but that's unlikely from how non-janky the track is unless Mi's app does a lot of smoothing."
bestoflegaladvice,fecv291,t1_fe9ljgh,1578985764.0,"OP sounds like exactly the kinda guy who would defend that action by saying that he was trying, but didn't succeed.

How does somebody get to be *at least* in their mid-20s and still have such a poor grasp of how things as basic as driving under the influence and self-medicating with alcohol are both bad fucking ideas?  I'd bet that most 10-15 year olds would provide better answers if they were presented with the same situation.

peloton,fecu07l,t1_fdycx30,1578984562.0,"Oh yeah definitely.  Pedersen's (autocorrect was putting the o in and I trusted it!) palmares as a whole are definitely not as impressive as Jungels', even giving the WC it's appropriate higher weight.

I just drew him as an example to say that Jungels won't have that ace card like Pedersen had with his ability to perform in those horrendous conditions.  Pedersen went into the WC as an unlikely underdog just as Jungels will go into Tokyo, but he had that extra edge that I don't think Jungels has an equivalent to.  He's still a serious contender and obviously an incredibly good rider, but I just don't think he has that edge that'll take him from being a good rider to Olympic champ.  He can still win, but it'll have to be from his own fitness and race acumen  against the popular favourites who are on paper better than him, rather than how the conditions severely thinned the field for Pedersen (not to devalue his win in any way as a win is a win and he won on the day which is all that matters, but I think even he would agree that he probably wouldn't have won had the conditions been nice)."

miband,feafas7,t1_feaapi0,1578947974.0,"The Mi Band 4 is <$40, so my guess would be that the GPS chipset and/or processing is just not up to the task.

Realistically they're a replacement for a Fitbit rather than a *much* more expensive Garmin watch like they want users to think.  While I'm sure Garmin's prices are wildly inflated with them basically having a monopoly on the performance wearable market, a device that's 100-300x less expensive simply can't be expected to perform the same, especially considering that even Garmin's low to mid range watches aren't perfect for recording bike rides.

OP would be better off getting a cheap GPS head unit like a Lezyne or Bryton for ~$80, or just using their phone to record as I'm assuming they have it on them already anyway.  The Mi Band will probably suffice for recording day to day activity, walks, and maybe runs, but my guess would be that the GPS recording capabilities may not be good enough for reliably recording rides."
