Mostly it’s people who went from eating a decent diet at home and working out more strenuously than in boot camp. Like you go from lifting weights and running a couple times a week to eating around the same or more food and doing only body weight exercises a couple times a week and running less than you used to. But it’s all CICO."

fatlogic,fcz904x,t1_fcz2zxu,1578096095.0,Well done! You found what works for you and I’m proud and happy for you!
fatlogic,fcrspew,t1_fcrrvi0,1577906107.0,Explain. I’m pretty positive at least
fatlogic,fcb1ix0,t3_egrqt2,1577580893.0,I tell myself everyday I’m going to get and go for a run. I like running. Even better now that I’m 135 lbs and it doesn’t hurt as much. But every morning I find an excuse not to from Valid reasons to ‘I’ll just do it tomorrow’. Why do I keep self sabotaging myself?
