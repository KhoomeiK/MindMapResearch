Ultramarathon,fejscix,t3_epaf6s,1579184653.0,"It's situational. If your feet swell really badly and you have a broken-in second pair of shoes that has a little more room that you might swap into later in the race, having a second pair might be worth it. Or, if there's water and/or mud before a drop but nothing after, you could swap into something dry and clean. I would practice the change in a long run so that you don't try it the first time race day.

Socks can be a nice treat to look forward to as long as the stop you have to make in order to change them doesn't mess you up. Sitting down during a race can be a death sentence if you're not careful. You can lock up pretty badly. Plus, if you were having no rubbing issues before the change and the new socks don't fit the same way, suddenly you're going to notice your socks.

My last 50 miler might as well have been a splash and dash. Due to conditions they changed the configuration to a looped course and I ended up with 60 or so ankle-to-calf deep water crossings. My shoes and socks were soaked the entire race and I packed a change of shoes and a couple extra pairs of socks, but didn't end up changing them. I had peace of mind in case I really needed to swap, but didn't feel it was necessary. I slathered my feet in Body Glide and walked away with nary a blister by some miracle. I did almost die when I squatted down at a drop bag stop to swap out my water bottles around mile 40 - my legs nearly locked up and I felt bruised for a little while. Don't do that."

probabilitytheory,feebh0b,t3_eoo8au,1579030327.0,"Are you talking about computing the probability of an event by counting the number of times that event happens, then dividing it by the number of times it had a chance to happen? Then you would always need to keep track of the number of times it happens and the number of chances.

For example, flipping a coin. To get the probability of landing on heads, you'd need to flip it a lot, and count how many flips and how many heads. The probability of heads is the number of heads divided by the number of flips. If you want to keep going, you need to keep tallying heads and flips from where you left off when you computed the probability of heads.

The second part of your question I don't think I understand."
