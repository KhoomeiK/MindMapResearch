First they launch an embarrassingly ineffective missile barrage, and then are so scared of a retaliation that didn't come, they shoot down a plane leaving their own country."
AskReddit,fe82gdq,t1_fe32wyv,1578921708.0,"Ok.  Those things alone are enough in my book.  I knew he mellowed out pretty significantly in the past 15 years.  When you said his ""stance"" I thought he was being a douche again.  And I agree.  As a kid, I loved watching him.  When he lost to Buster Douglas it was like a super hero had fallen.  Him losing was a bigger blow to my childhood than realizing Santa wasn't real."

space,fd6kvdm,t1_fd6i2hd,1578192521.0,"It might be from the ground, but from space you wouldn't see red.  Sky color is cause by light from the sun being absorbed/refracted differently by the atmosphere.  Which part of the color spectrum is not absorbed passes through and we then see.  The sky normally appears blue because blue light is scattered in all directions by our atmosphere, yet when viewed from space, it is clear besides the horizons.  The red sky you're seeing is likely cause by the smoke reflecting the fire's light back at you.  You wouldn't see it from space."

What about when it grows to a point that it is feeding the entire world's population within a few generations.
