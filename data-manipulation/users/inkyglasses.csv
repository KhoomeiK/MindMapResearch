femalefashionadvice,fdsauz0,t3_emwxtv,1578698363.0,"I’ll add my two cents:

While some of the things that your stylist said were absolutely not appropriate and she should ABSOLUTELY have asked if you were comfortable before just assuming that she could be in the room with you while you changed, I used to work for a certain high end department store that starts with N-and ends with -rom and I am here to say that the problem was, at least partially, a Nordstrom problem. 

I can not even tell you how many times I was tasked with finding something classic and reasonable, like a black cashmere cardigan or a simple sweater, and could come up with absolutely nothing to show the customer because it simple didn’t exist in our inventory. Or it did, but they only had it in a store six states away. Your budget, while totally reasonable for what you wanted to buy, does not stretch that far at Nordstrom, especially for business professional clothes. At Nordstrom, there are cheap clothes, and there are expensive clothes. While it may appear that there is more of a mid-range by viewing the website, those clothes are simply not in stock, or they are cheap clothes masquerading as good quality because of an inflated price tag. The reason your stylist brought you those Vince pants is because they are in the “actual good quality” category, and have a price tag to go with it. And they felt amazing, right? I worked in that department and sold those clothes, but brought customers pieces from all over the store. There’s so much of a quality difference, it’s hard to put something on from TopShop after a piece from Vince. 

With casual clothes, there is more of a mid range price option, but with professional clothes, there just isn’t. 

Also, side note about Nordstrom: they are pushing their customers harder and harder to shop online and they don’t treat their employees well. It’s very hard to make a living there while also servicing what the customer is actually asking for. 

While your stylist was not tactful about voicing her frustrations, she also wasn’t lying. Take whatever you’d like from my experience. 

My advice would be to go to a brand like Aritzia—I’ve found their stuff to be very good quality and fairly reasonably priced.

EDIT: Also, I definitely want to add that not everything that is expensive is good quality. There were so many things that we pulled off the floor that were $400 because they were falling apart off the truck."
