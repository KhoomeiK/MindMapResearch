Good on you. That's one of the easiest ways to connect with someone digitally.

*> I'm not the type person comes up with a random topic to talk about, which makes it really hard for me to maintain conversations.*

Hey listen. I'm not either, but if we look at this logically, there should be ways we can usher in random topics.

Save the (completely) random topic until you've broken ice. A wildly unusual, specific or deep question may be too overwhelming or intimate for someone who's less than a friend.

\-Ask some questions that help you know her a little better. You can start off slow and easy with stuff like ""What are you up to this weekend?"", ""What did you do over the weekend?"" and go from there to learn about them. People love to talk about themselves and their passions if you let them.

You can think of topics to ask that somewhat relate to things she has mentioned from here on forth. If you're like me who can't think of things to say on the spot, it may not be necessary to force yourself to have something to respond with at that moment. Maybe you can take what you've learned about them, dig a little into the topic (if there was something said) so you have some knowledge about it, and save it for a future interaction. This will give you leeway with the possibility of into developing a common ground, making conversations easier.

Don't pressure yourself into conversing too much if you feel there isn't much to talk about. If the current conversation doesn't go too far, that's okay. Better to end it on an okay note than to drag it out."
socialskills,fech7x4,t3_eo92c1,1578973851.0,"For me, a conversation should go somewhere if you're still trying to break the ice with someone. There should be some underlying purpose to it. I've seen, been part of, and started meaningless conversations... and thinking back, I think ""What the fuck is the point of this...Where is this going?"" Of course, this can lead to a lot of people trying to start convos with me that I back out of before it even begins, which just hurts future opportunities that person will want to continue talking to you. 

I love communicating over text because I have a bit more time to compose my thoughts like I'm doing right meow in this reply. A lot of people find the act of pressing keys on a virtual keyboard to be too much effort. They tend to type a little as possible, in other words, they're not that invested in the conversation. You probably don't need to invest into the conversation with lengthy replies if this is the case. If you converse with people like me, I absolutely love long thoughtful responses. That's the first thing you'd want to look for. If the other person prefers speaking, try to set up time to meet up eventually. Save the deeper meaningful conversations for those times.

I've written long replies because all the thoughts were with me at the time and I wanted to let it out. Very little people actually read and soaked it all in. Effort was mostly wasted.

How you hold it will also depend on the kind of person you're speaking with. Cutesy/immature stuff can be left with an S.O or very close family/friends you've known for a long time. Hold back on letting yourself go on texts until you've broken the ice and created rapport with new people, as you want to gauge their personality from how they write, how open they are (or how much they're giving into it).

Conversation starters like the examples you've given are very stale, because it's safe and use way too often by everyone. Watch some videos from the YT channel **Charisma on Demand** for some ideas on that. Look for starters that can better lead the conversation in a direction you're comfortable with.... you'll probably have a much easier time carrying your weight of the convo.

If the conversation starts or moves into an area you're not interested in or you're not knowledgeable in (me most of the time), TBH I'm still trying to work on this, but I'm hearing that one thing that helps if the topic switches to this is to either pitch a thoughtful or open-ended question to the other person to get them to speak more. Try to make it a question that you yourself are interested in hearing. That will help make the listening role in a conversation much easier and you may be able to take what you heard to switch out of the topic, or chip in your thoughts and ask another question on top of it.

I got side-tracked with in-person conversations...

Going back, if the text conversation is going nowhere (and you're sensing it):

1) Don't be the one who's dragging it out. This hurts your ""quality convo. reputation"" with that person. If you sent a pointless text, leave it at that; if they respond, great. If not, great. Do not do any ""hey did you see that?"" like 5 mins after. If they didn't read it yet, maybe they're busy with something else. If they did and didn't respond, either they didn't see any point in responding or couldn't think of something to say, and that's fine too. Remember your convo should have some degree of purpose. 

2) If that person is dragging out a directionless conversation, either make a brief reply and say you gotta go do something (cook, clean, go out, run errands, go to bed, whatever you can think of). It makes you look busy/important and they don't have anything they can say (or should say) against you.

3) Don't respond just because you feel the need to. If they're the one who isn't making the conversation any more interesting due to a clear lack of effort/interest, just don't reply. Another conversation will unfold down the road should something call for it.

RocketLeagueAnalysis,fcwigtc,t3_ei1cjr,1578026496.0,"Video timestamps:

1:25 is why I never cheat that far up. You can't guarantee the 50/50 won't fly over your head, so always give yourself a bit more wiggle room.

3:04, I would've opted the safe (and lame) route by swinging into net. Blindly going vertical doesn't guarantee you won't be beat by the blue guy beside you, and also your teammate just used a stick of boost to go up for a bad clear AND to jump off the wall to try to make things better. He's definitely low on boost, and shouldn't be the one in net for that. If you must go for it, use the wall. This saves you boost and it'll give you more perspective on who may be on it. Otherwise, that's a play I wouldn't invest into and would rather let them take a weak shot at net giving us an easy clear.

3:55, I'm unsure if that was worth the risk. Your teammate leap off the wall with virtually no boost left, and you're contesting a goalie when you're half a second too late to safely go for it. In these situations, there's a very small window when going for off-backboard balls while your teammate is still recovering off the wall is relatively safe.... well now that I'm that specific, I'd say it's pretty much unsafe most of the time.

5:44 boops like that don't get you anywhere. You juked your teammate. And even if it went off a more desirable surface than your roof, how far is that going to get you with that little boost? Good chance you send the ball closer to them and the goalie can easily take it off your hands. I would've played a bit further back and waited, since guy on the wall has a timeframe of when he can afford to touch the ball given that he's pointed horizontally and the ball is bouncing (he doesn't have all the time in the world to decide on what he wants to do, and will most likely touch the ball because a car to his side is unreachable). This means he's more than likely going to pop the ball back towards you, and you can use whatever you have to pop the ball up high on the wall for your teammate to attack. This will also buy you time to retreat."
RocketLeagueAnalysis,fcwglxl,t3_eijsna,1578025102.0,"1:48 Missed an opportunity to pass to your teammate for a redirect (which is significantly harder to save than a half-court shot on goal). He's in front of your opponent, so he's closer to the ball, meaning he's most likely to reach it first.

2:00, things I'm noticing when you go for the follow-up to the play you just make is that after you leave, there's a huge gap in the rotation with your teammate because of the team spent reaching for boost. By 2:10, you now see you're in a situation where your teammate is now holding you up, forcing you to shadow defend.

As you get better, you'll know your boundaries and skill limitations, and how far you can push your risky moves. So find what that threshold of ""stupid"" is for you and play within your limits. Use practice mode to push your boundaries.

""Playing faster"" is not be taken literally. Yes you shouldn't play at a snail's pace because you are disadvantaged by speed and momentum (in a stalement 50/50, someone coming in with more momentum will likely win. If you're racing for a ball, someone who knows how to accelerate faster will beat you to it, etc.). Playing faster really means how much further you can read into the game's situation, plays and how things can/will unfold. It's like playing chess and being steps ahead of your opponent. 

This helps you see things ahead of time (which helps you make decisions sooner), it will help you adapt and shift roles quicker. See the pattern? It's not moving faster, it's deciding quicker."
RocketLeagueAnalysis,fcqwq81,t1_fcqsmhl,1577893379.0,"So to make some examples fron your provided video, there were too many times, you waited for the ball to drop right onto your lap, when your opponent was literally staring you in the face ready to go for it first. Sure if you want to observe your opppnent's tendencies, let it happen, but don't keep letting it happen. You now know your opppnent won't chicken out. Either beat him to it, or leave the ball.

I tell this to a friend of mine. If you have no intention of taking the ball and you're low on boost, don't wait around. Why are you telling him to take a free shot on your net? Go and get boost! If your opponent has the ball on the wall, he can boom that over your head easily. There is no reason why you have to cruise beneath him. Think about that."
RocketLeagueAnalysis,fcqsmhl,t3_eiiwoc,1577891576.0,"At a high level way of seeing the game, every commitment you make towards landing a goal bears the risk of you leaving the net unprotected. You feel less of this when teammates with different roles are present, but in he cotext of 1s, you are the entire team, the attacker and defender.

This is just saying that you need to weigh the risk of the decisions you make when you go for a shot, when you contest for possession of the ball. ""If this doesn't go well, will I be able to recover in time to stop the ball from going in?"" is what you have to ask yourself.

Take shots that have low consequences, challenge the ball when odds are in your favour.

Remember that if you let your opponent score, you have to work even harder than he does by scoring twice in order to win. Before you commit to something you aren't certain you have control over (i.e. ""can i make that aerial in time before he does? is he going to flick now or later?""), decide whether you absolutely have to take a risk now or if you can wait it out for opportunities to arise.




This defensive mindset will get you into diamond level alone.

As you improve your mechanics and decision making, you'll have to start relying less on the opponent giving you opportunities, and making your own."

Good on you. That's one of the easiest ways to connect with someone digitally.

*> I'm not the type person comes up with a random topic to talk about, which makes it really hard for me to maintain conversations.*

Hey listen. I'm not either, but if we look at this logically, there should be ways we can usher in random topics.

Save the (completely) random topic until you've broken ice. A wildly unusual, specific or deep question may be too overwhelming or intimate for someone who's less than a friend.

\-Ask some questions that help you know her a little better. You can start off slow and easy with stuff like ""What are you up to this weekend?"", ""What did you do over the weekend?"" and go from there to learn about them. People love to talk about themselves and their passions if you let them.

You can think of topics to ask that somewhat relate to things she has mentioned from here on forth. If you're like me who can't think of things to say on the spot, it may not be necessary to force yourself to have something to respond with at that moment. Maybe you can take what you've learned about them, dig a little into the topic (if there was something said) so you have some knowledge about it, and save it for a future interaction. This will give you leeway with the possibility of into developing a common ground, making conversations easier.

Don't pressure yourself into conversing too much if you feel there isn't much to talk about. If the current conversation doesn't go too far, that's okay. Better to end it on an okay note than to drag it out."
socialskills,fech7x4,t3_eo92c1,1578973851.0,"For me, a conversation should go somewhere if you're still trying to break the ice with someone. There should be some underlying purpose to it. I've seen, been part of, and started meaningless conversations... and thinking back, I think ""What the fuck is the point of this...Where is this going?"" Of course, this can lead to a lot of people trying to start convos with me that I back out of before it even begins, which just hurts future opportunities that person will want to continue talking to you. 

I love communicating over text because I have a bit more time to compose my thoughts like I'm doing right meow in this reply. A lot of people find the act of pressing keys on a virtual keyboard to be too much effort. They tend to type a little as possible, in other words, they're not that invested in the conversation. You probably don't need to invest into the conversation with lengthy replies if this is the case. If you converse with people like me, I absolutely love long thoughtful responses. That's the first thing you'd want to look for. If the other person prefers speaking, try to set up time to meet up eventually. Save the deeper meaningful conversations for those times.

I've written long replies because all the thoughts were with me at the time and I wanted to let it out. Very little people actually read and soaked it all in. Effort was mostly wasted.

How you hold it will also depend on the kind of person you're speaking with. Cutesy/immature stuff can be left with an S.O or very close family/friends you've known for a long time. Hold back on letting yourself go on texts until you've broken the ice and created rapport with new people, as you want to gauge their personality from how they write, how open they are (or how much they're giving into it).

Conversation starters like the examples you've given are very stale, because it's safe and use way too often by everyone. Watch some videos from the YT channel **Charisma on Demand** for some ideas on that. Look for starters that can better lead the conversation in a direction you're comfortable with.... you'll probably have a much easier time carrying your weight of the convo.

If the conversation starts or moves into an area you're not interested in or you're not knowledgeable in (me most of the time), TBH I'm still trying to work on this, but I'm hearing that one thing that helps if the topic switches to this is to either pitch a thoughtful or open-ended question to the other person to get them to speak more. Try to make it a question that you yourself are interested in hearing. That will help make the listening role in a conversation much easier and you may be able to take what you heard to switch out of the topic, or chip in your thoughts and ask another question on top of it.

&#x200B;

I got side-tracked with in-person conversations...

Going back, if the text conversation is going nowhere (and you're sensing it):

1) Don't be the one who's dragging it out. This hurts your ""quality convo. reputation"" with that person. If you sent a pointless text, leave it at that; if they respond, great. If not, great. Do not do any ""hey did you see that?"" like 5 mins after. If they didn't read it yet, maybe they're busy with something else. If they did and didn't respond, either they didn't see any point in responding or couldn't think of something to say, and that's fine too. Remember your convo should have some degree of purpose. 

2) If that person is dragging out a directionless conversation, either make a brief reply and say you gotta go do something (cook, clean, go out, run errands, go to bed, whatever you can think of). It makes you look busy/important and they don't have anything they can say (or should say) against you.

3) Don't respond just because you feel the need to. If they're the one who isn't making the conversation any more interesting due to a clear lack of effort/interest, just don't reply. Another conversation will unfold down the road should something call for it.

RocketLeagueAnalysis,fcwigtc,t3_ei1cjr,1578026496.0,"Video timestamps:

1:25 is why I never cheat that far up. You can't guarantee the 50/50 won't fly over your head, so always give yourself a bit more wiggle room.

3:04, I would've opted the safe (and lame) route by swinging into net. Blindly going vertical doesn't guarantee you won't be beat by the blue guy beside you, and also your teammate just used a stick of boost to go up for a bad clear AND to jump off the wall to try to make things better. He's definitely low on boost, and shouldn't be the one in net for that. If you must go for it, use the wall. This saves you boost and it'll give you more perspective on who may be on it. Otherwise, that's a play I wouldn't invest into and would rather let them take a weak shot at net giving us an easy clear.

3:55, I'm unsure if that was worth the risk. Your teammate leap off the wall with virtually no boost left, and you're contesting a goalie when you're half a second too late to safely go for it. In these situations, there's a very small window when going for off-backboard balls while your teammate is still recovering off the wall is relatively safe.... well now that I'm that specific, I'd say it's pretty much unsafe most of the time.

5:44 boops like that don't get you anywhere. You juked your teammate. And even if it went off a more desirable surface than your roof, how far is that going to get you with that little boost? Good chance you send the ball closer to them and the goalie can easily take it off your hands. I would've played a bit further back and waited, since guy on the wall has a timeframe of when he can afford to touch the ball given that he's pointed horizontally and the ball is bouncing (he doesn't have all the time in the world to decide on what he wants to do, and will most likely touch the ball because a car to his side is unreachable). This means he's more than likely going to pop the ball back towards you, and you can use whatever you have to pop the ball up high on the wall for your teammate to attack. This will also buy you time to retreat."
RocketLeagueAnalysis,fcwglxl,t3_eijsna,1578025102.0,"1:48 Missed an opportunity to pass to your teammate for a redirect (which is significantly harder to save than a half-court shot on goal). He's in front of your opponent, so he's closer to the ball, meaning he's most likely to reach it first.

2:00, things I'm noticing when you go for the follow-up to the play you just make is that after you leave, there's a huge gap in the rotation with your teammate because of the team spent reaching for boost. By 2:10, you now see you're in a situation where your teammate is now holding you up, forcing you to shadow defend. I'm relating this to how I play myself, and unless the teammate can space himself from you to begin with balance out the spacing (consequentially timing and overall pacing between you two), these rotation risks we make can result in these moments. It's not ""wrong"" per se, but more of an observation of looking at other options."

As you get better, you'll know your boundaries and skill limitations, and how far you can push your risky moves. So find what that threshold of ""stupid"" is for you and play within your limits. Use practice mode to push your boundaries.

""Playing faster"" is not be taken literally. Yes you shouldn't play at a snail's pace because you are disadvantaged by speed and momentum (in a stalement 50/50, someone coming in with more momentum will likely win. If you're racing for a ball, someone who knows how to accelerate faster will beat you to it, etc.). Playing faster really means how much further you can read into the game's situation, plays and how things can/will unfold. It's like playing chess and being steps ahead of your opponent. 

This helps you see things ahead of time (which helps you make decisions sooner), it will help you adapt and shift roles quicker. See the pattern? It's not moving faster, it's deciding quicker."
RocketLeagueAnalysis,fcqwq81,t1_fcqsmhl,1577893379.0,"So to make some examples fron your provided video, there were too many times, you waited for the ball to drop right onto your lap, when your opponent was literally staring you in the face ready to go for it first. Sure if you want to observe your opppnent's tendencies, let it happen, but don't keep letting it happen. You now know your opppnent won't chicken out. Either beat him to it, or leave the ball.

I tell this to a friend of mine. If you have no intention of taking the ball and you're low on boost, don't wait around. Why are you telling him to take a free shot on your net? Go and get boost! If your opponent has the ball on the wall, he can boom that over your head easily. There is no reason why you have to cruise beneath him. Think about that."
RocketLeagueAnalysis,fcqsmhl,t3_eiiwoc,1577891576.0,"At a high level way of seeing the game, every commitment you make towards landing a goal bears the risk of you leaving the net unprotected. You feel less of this when teammates with different roles are present, but in he cotext of 1s, you are the entire team, the attacker and defender.

This is just saying that you need to weigh the risk of the decisions you make when you go for a shot, when you contest for possession of the ball. ""If this doesn't go well, will I be able to recover in time to stop the ball from going in?"" is what you have to ask yourself.

Take shots that have low consequences, challenge the ball when odds are in your favour.

Remember that if you let your opponent score, you have to work even harder than he does by scoring twice in order to win. Before you commit to something you aren't certain you have control over (i.e. ""can i make that aerial in time before he does? is he going to flick now or later?""), decide whether you absolutely have to take a risk now or if you can wait it out for opportunities to arise.




This defensive mindset will get you into diamond level alone.

As you improve your mechanics and decision making, you'll have to start relying less on the opponent giving you opportunities, and making your own."

On the flip side, this can also be what makes them unappealing, because I can see this Nendo being a ""reskin"" of a previous product, and that just sends all uniqueness and sense of individuality out the window.

Figmas are basically action figures you may have played with when you were 7, except of much higher quality... I never found AFs to be appealing at that age, and I still feel that way at 28.
