nuzlocke,fendhni,t1_fen6hrl,1579282346.0,What was the set?
nuzlocke,femzubi,t3_eq1k72,1579273782.0,"My own example is Donna the Walrein from my Leaf Green randlocke--named for Aaron Donald but was effectively Kyogre. Due to an amusing TM and compatibility set, she ended up with the set of Surf/Ice Beam/Body Slam/Thunder and Thick Fat.

I always start my rando runs with random starters given they can evolve twice. I quickly learned that STAB Water Gun and Powder Snow was broken as hell to begin the game even with randomized encounters. Even though she got joined by the Flame Wheeling Ludicolo and Spore/Zap Cannon Venomoth, Donna was the most unbeatable chunky tank I've ever ran. She's still with us if I ever get around to a second run on my Leaf Green game, and I want to run a Walrein set in a non-rando run at some point as well."

nuzlocke,fejwe6a,t1_fejuxhu,1579187386.0,Vaporeon is a massive win con in almost any locke.
nuzlocke,fejqq7q,t3_epe65b,1579183462.0,"If it helps, the Dragonite line is next to useless in normal runs. Stats are straight up bad until L55 and you need massive TM/Surf coverage + Dragon Rage to even have a chance of survival."
