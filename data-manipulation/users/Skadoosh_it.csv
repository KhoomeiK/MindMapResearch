Our raid time for team 2 is Saturday Midnight until 3am Sunday Server time, with an additional time slot from Midnight Sunday to 3am Monday, depending on our progress in Molten Core and Onyxia.

We are also open to partnering with smaller guilds who wish to remain separate but also want the chance to raid. Anyone interested in joining raid team 2 please message Stoneclaw, Bigxmage or Antsinmyeyes in game or myself via PM here."
