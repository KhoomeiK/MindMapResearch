But seriously, it’s okay to admire someone for what they do...even if they’re a reprehensible human being. For instance, say I like a guitar player for his skill and playing and phrasing and the various things he’s done...and when I say that, people just _have_ to come out of the woodwork to proclaim how terrible he really is in real life and how he did horrible things and blah blah blah. 

BUT, I can still admire his playing, yes? Or do we have to throw everything out? Because if that’s the case, then nearly all forms of art would be thrown out because I guarantee you the artist behind it has probably done something bad...some worse than others."

With so many sub-genres of metal out there, Kiss absolutely falls into one of them. Early pioneers of “glam metal” perhaps. With all the members of various “hair metal” bands in the 80s can be in their own category, Kiss certainly can be also. Not to mention their influence on other metal bands. Pantera’s Dimebag Darrell absolutely idolized them as a kid and he wanted to be Ace Frehley. But I guess maybe you don’t consider Pantera metal either.

I was 285 and I have type-2 diabetes and i’m 58 years old. I could barely go for walks, as my legs were just giving out on me and I was so close to buying a cane to help me. I wasn’t _yet_ there to start riding in those little scooters around a store, but I wasn’t far off. Forget about going up and down stairs. Forget about doing much of anything. 

I’ve lost 65 pounds in the last 6 months after totally altering my lifestyle. No, not on any specific “diet”, as those never worked long for me. I’m pushing 60 and if I want to continue to live into an older age, I came to the realization that I needed to change how I lived...and keep doing it _forever_. This isn’t something I go on and then just go back to how I was...it’s for the rest of my life. It has to be.

My “secret”? It’s not really any secret. And this is what works _for me_. Everyone is different and I can only comment on what I’ve done. I’m not one of those “all you have to do” people, I can only say what has worked for me, and I can’t say this will work for everyone. And seriously, this isn’t any “secret” at all. We all know this stuff:

1. I stopped eating so goddamn much. Seriously, there was _so_ much junk food and fast food. A typical breakfast would be 2 sausage & egg biscuits with 2 hash browns from Mcdonald’s. Then snack on a big bag of Doritos during the morning, then more fast-food for lunch, then call my wife to ask her to “pick something up” on her way home...like 5-Guys. I cut all that out. No more. 

2. Started eating healthier. No, I didn’t cut out _any_ food group at all. But I avoid processed food as much as I can. Fresh fruit and vegetables, high-fiber whole grain breads, cut out red meat mostly, but eat fish and have chicken dishes. My wife and I love to cook, so that helps because then we can control exactly what we put in our food. Well, for the most part. You can’t control EVERYTHING. But again, I still don’t eat so much of it. If there’s a name for the “diet”, I guess it mostly resembles the Mediterranean diet. 

3. I only eat from 6am to noon. Intermittent fasting I’ve heard it called. That’s the window of time I eat in. After noon, I don’t eat anything else until 6am the next morning. I limit my caloric intake to around 1200 a day too. Both of these was surprisingly easy to get used to. I don’t know why.

4. That right there let me lose a ton of that weight, which in turn allowed me to start walking again. I now walk at least 3 miles a day and it’s getting more and more. No, for me this didn’t accelerate my weight-loss, but it’s important for my heart and mental well-being...I just “feel” better after a walk now...mentally. Hard to explain. Not sure if that will last, but so far it’s great. It’s down to the point where I really _want_ to go on a walk now and am pissed when the weather is bad. I’m actually able to do things out in the yard now, like shovel the driveway this weekend after the snow. Before that was impossible as my legs would just give out and my back would be killing me. 

5. I’m not a pain about it. At least I try not to be. I don’t do the “sorry, I can’t have any of that, I’m on a diet...have you heard I’ve lost blah blah blah?” Like over Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners with our families, I just ate like everyone else. Those were two days I just didn’t do anything special. Sure, people kept saying I lost so much weight, but I didn’t make a big deal about it. I just said “thanks” while stuffing my mouth with mashed potatoes and baked macaroni & cheese. But I found I still didn’t eat as much as I normally would just a year ago. 

Anyway, that’s what is happening to me. I can’t say I’ll keep this up, because I’m only human with human failings like anyone else. I can only endeavor to keep doing it. I had to if I wanted to make it into an older age. 

TL;DR I stopped eating so much and lost 65 pounds so far."

NOW, I must admit that this could be just for that one store I went into and that particular person working there. But I heard the same thing from other people there.

For online, I found that Sweetwater to be the best, at least here in the US. You can call them and talk to them and they’ll actually work with you on the price.

unpopularopinion,fe0e88n,t3_enc63v,1578811652.0,"If someone mentions their religion in an innocuous way, such as “I was talking with this guy I go to church with about the new Beef and Cheddar Taco at Taco-Town the other day, and...”. It’s really no big deal. But if they start talking about imposing laws or judgments based on their version of the invisible man that lives in the sky, I’m going to push back...hard. That IS forcing their religion on someone else. 

And for the past 35 years, the usual thing that happens is that religious people around me find out I don’t believe in anything (I don’t even consider myself an atheist anymore as that itself is a stanch belief), so they decide they’re the ones that are going to “save” me....and then we’re off to the races. But I stopped a long long LONG time ago trying to get any one to come around to my side of thinking. They can believe what they want, just like I can _not_ believe in any of it. The “live and let live” thing. But when they start trying to affect the very way I live my life and make laws based on _their_ religious beliefs, then I’ll push back."

So naturally, anything he does from now on will play off of who he is. Is having some sort of advertising gig as the spokesman for GM cars be out of the question? “Hey, Prince Harry here....drive like a king in our new Chevy Impala!”  or whatever. It may take some time, but him wanting to get off the taxpayer teat to make a living for him and his family is admirable. Will that happen? Who knows. Guess we’ll see."

I’m not saying it’s wrong at all, but how is your relationship to your parents...who themselves may be boomers? Have you severed all ties with them? Do you personally blame them? Are you as hostile and angry with them as people appear to be online? Or is that all too close and it’s easier to do all this “from afar”?

I’m not trying to snipe here or prove any point really. I’m just curious. I personally severed all ties with my family decades ago over other reasons (that they were ignorant, racist, bigoted assholes), but I’m wondering has this problem caused rifts in families where millennials have boomer parents or grandparents."

Sane people watch it to hate on it and to see “what they’ll say next” so they can be indignant about it the next day, and go “why do they keep having these people on their shows.”

All the while, the networks are profiting on everyone watching them. Controversy sells. It’s the same thing when you see them doing the “both sides of the debate” on things like vaccines or climate change...even though there IS no debate.
