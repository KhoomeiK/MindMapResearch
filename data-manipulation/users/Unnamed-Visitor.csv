I cannot even imagine the amount of pain your body is going through. Surround yourself with good people who will help you. you're going to be in a lot of pain for a while, but as long as people are there to help you, you won't fall under. Be verbal about your problems, talk about what's going on in your head, see a professional and get some advice. Life is rough, but that's why people help one another."
