MDMA,ffdi6lp,t1_ffdhqxj,1579821386.0,My friend’s selling me 0.2g but I was planning on taking 0.1
KingKrule,ffd1cwa,t3_esyk1b,1579811485.0,“Bathed in grey” is used quite a lot too in his Edgar and Zoo Kid stuff
MDMA,ffcrlhv,t1_ffcn4k0,1579805816.0,I have a mouth guard. Is it really that extreme?

KingKrule,ffb2sxo,t1_ffb2mo7,1579750352.0,"I liked it but I thought the effects were a little over the top at some points.
Have you seen his live performance of A Slide In and The Ooz at Montague Arms? THATS fucking legendary"
KingKrule,ffb23sf,t1_ffb1trq,1579749864.0,It does!! I’ve heard he’s so good live too I’m so excited
KingKrule,ffb0w3g,t3_esjdwi,1579749042.0,Where are you seeing him in April??? I’m seeing him on the 18 Apr in Montreal
KingKrule,ff6y9pt,t3_erz9ci,1579637364.0,I hope there won’t be. He already gave us one track. That should be enough. Patience.
soundcloud,ff30rro,t3_ercyci,1579530603.0,"Maybe people who just lost interest. You can usually tell they’re bots by their photo and their activity on their account.

If they have one track and it’s a promotion sort of “submit your track” deal, they’re a bot. If you posted a track and got a like, a follow, and/or a comment within minutes or sometimes seconds of posting it, they’re a bot."
depression,ff2vcel,t3_erbiwf,1579525593.0, Wow. I never thought about it like that
depression,fetpi07,t3_eqcju4,1579378019.0,Or they make it seem like you’re making a bigger deal out of it than it really is. They make you feel like you’re over-exaggerating and this is just something everyone goes through
KingKrule,fes4ewb,t3_eqgcyl,1579361310.0,Pretty abstract. Good on you for figuring that out
KingKrule,fermdh7,t1_fer2g9j,1579355737.0,Reminds me of my school trip to Europe this September/October. On the transit going through Rome listening to ANP2D from start to finish. I only ever listen to that album start to finish

Psychedelics,feite8l,t1_feit7gg,1579146720.0,Thanks for the info!
soundcloud,feit877,t3_epdor1,1579146595.0,"I mean it sorta makes sense. You can’t be playing music on the same account on both devices. 

Now that I think of it, it’s probably so that someone isn’t able to share their account with friends and everybody has to subscribe separately so there’s more money for SoundCloud. Kind of like a safeguard to what people do with netflix, crave, etc"
Psychedelics,feit3qg,t1_feisvbv,1579146505.0,High dose as in more than 6g
Psychedelics,feit2g3,t1_feisvbv,1579146480.0,Cool
relationships,feit191,t3_epce1k,1579146456.0,"I mean, I’m a teen and never been married, but if my partner brought up a discussion about a prenup, I would be sort of weird about it but I’d be open to it. 

Of course if it was fair I would sign it and be happy that we would both be protected, but it’s almost like I would feel that the other person doesn’t have as much faith in the relationship lasting as I would, which I know wouldn’t be the case, but I wouldn’t be able to help not feeling that way."
awfuleverything,feispgy,t3_ep7x78,1579146219.0,Hah
soundcloud,feismqu,t3_epdor1,1579146165.0,"No. If you’re playing music on SoundCloud on your laptop, you’ll go on SoundCloud on your phone and when you start playing music on your phone the music on your laptop stops"
Psychedelics,feisex5,t1_feirnwd,1579146011.0,"Alright, good to know. I’m doing it in two weeks with my buddy. How much should I do my first time? I have experience with psychedelics, high dose shroom trips"

Psychedelics,feim3d3,t3_epbqg2,1579141723.0,I’ve never done acid so I don’t know anything about it. Im wondering why it was wrapped in tinfoil? Does it smell?
deathgrips,feil880,t1_feikl01,1579141135.0,"Man some of those lyrics are so powerful it’s crazy. To Pray Is To Accept Defeat, I love that line. The Manson sample at the beginning is fucking crazy too. I LOVE how Exmilitary started off like that. 

The first time listening to the album right after Manson says “I deal the cards” and Ride just fucking heaves into the song I had the biggest smile and awestruck expression on my face. Best studying session ever!"
deathgrips,feijnv6,t1_feijfo0,1579140076.0,I’m culturing her as we speak ;)

deathgrips,fehc8hj,t3_ep2egn,1579113577.0,"Beware is probably my favourite warmup song ever, whether it be for the gym, a presentation in school, or a job interview. 

I also was just recently dumped by my girlfriend who was and still is extremely special to me and DG helps me fight through that pain and stop feeling sorry for myself. 

They get me in the mood to kick the shit out of life. Songs like Beware, No Love, Hacker, Dilemma, and 80808 make me wanna FUCK. SHIT. UP.

Because i fucking deal the cards. Nobody else."
KingKrule,feh2r53,t3_eox983,1579107933.0,I love Swan Lake
KingKrule,fegcaix,t1_feftgnp,1579087358.0,Ah yes okay. The website says I’ll just get an amphitheater license instead of a bar license if I’m under 18
KingKrule,fegc7wc,t1_feftgnp,1579087264.0,Okay. Because I’m trying to find it on the ticket and it doesn’t mention anything about age

FrankOcean,fees3be,t1_feeowa1,1579040015.0,It’s the same way you showed me
soundcloud,feerzrb,t1_feepn5f,1579039954.0,Ah I see what you’re saying. I somewhat agree but it doesn’t affect me too too much cuz most of the stuff I listen to is far from that genre. Although I did notice yesterday they made a playlist for me based on what’s been recently uploaded and probably one every four or five songs was a trap beat or something
soundcloud,feeemak,t1_fee5y19,1579032168.0,"That’s why young people go to SoundCloud. Because it’s a platform where anybody is free to make music from their bedroom. Not everybody has access to a studio or enough money to buy even basic equipment to use at home. 

Everybody is learning and improving. Just have patience and try and encourage young artists. Give constructive feedback whether it be praise or criticism. 

There’s absolutely no use in you shitting on all these young artists when it seems you haven’t done anything to try and help them or point them in the right direction."
soundcloud,feee1va,t1_fedplyb,1579031835.0,100% agree. A lot of popular artists also have albums and songs not available on any other platforms except SoundCloud
soundcloud,feedxq7,t1_fee1h3k,1579031767.0,There’s much more than just mumble rap on SoundCloud
soundcloud,fedpde6,t3_eomx4t,1579016994.0,"I personally still enjoy it. SC has a lot of artists and songs that I like that aren’t on Spotify or other streaming services. But yes I do agree with the bot thing. I posted a track a few months back and within seconds got a follow, comment and like from a bot. Kind of disappointing. 
Just posted a new track yesterday and no bots though, thankfully. But if you’re not telling friends to listen to your track it’s very difficult for one to be found and heard. It’s sort of frustrating and discouraging."

relationships,fds4ybo,t1_fds4qf1,1578694455.0,That is not at all what I said. Yes maybe I’m reading too much into this situation but we’re not posting on social media to somehow get back at eachother and it’s not like we’ve talked since the breakup
relationships,fds4s4b,t1_fds4ksi,1578694344.0,I’m not saying my ex and I will certainly get back together. That is not what I said. I am asking if this situation potentially harmed my chances of getting back together.
relationships,fdnblev,t3_em7g8o,1578582256.0,"If you weren’t happy and he was making you feel bad then you made the right decision in breaking up with him. But if you both still really love eachother you two need to have a big talk about how to treat one another and how much criticism is too much, etc."
depression,fdk1bjt,t3_elqwy9,1578493596.0,"Just feeling empty. Feeling alone. I think most of the problem is that I spend too much time alone. Things were doing a complete 180 when me and my girl were together but she broke up with me last Thursday and lately things have been so so. 

I think I’m actually getting better though. Suicide hasn’t been on my mind nearly as much. It’s still there, but I would never kill myself. 

I personally just like to fantasize about a world where I’m no longer existing and this constant hurt isn’t there anymore."
relationships,fdk0uew,t3_els1q6,1578493249.0,"Also think about this: if you pay for her and her daughters’ plane tickets to go to her son’s wedding, is that the only favour she’s gonna ask for? I get the feeling that this a sort of test to see how far you’re willing to go to keep her happy and to keep her affection. Next thing you know, you’re paying the other half of her bills and you’re just as much a sucker as her ex who she’s tricked into supporting her financially.

Talk to her about how this makes you feel and talk about your concerns with the relationship."
relationships,fdjzjnh,t3_els1q6,1578492254.0,"Just say no. If you’re not invited, it’s not your problem. The fact that she doesn’t want her ex to see you because he’ll stop paying her bills is a big problem that needs to be addressed and I’d suggest talking to her about it ASAP

Good luck"
Instagram,fdjph45,t1_fdjc8dt,1578482236.0,Thanks
relationships,fdj41k2,t1_fdj3yd8,1578457870.0,Ah okay. Thanks for the info. Do you think if I DM you at a later point with more questions you could possibly help me and give me some pointers?
relationships,fdj3y09,t1_fdj3rpc,1578457796.0,But it can also be used as a means of rebuilding your ex’s attraction for you. I get what your saying but that’s not what I’m asking the OP of the comment.
relationships,fdj3nx0,t1_fdj3h8x,1578457587.0,Yeah of course all that stuff. I’ve been doing that more and more now. I mean did you get your ex back though? Did their attraction regain momentum? What happened?
relationships,fdj35ok,t1_fdj2fa1,1578457211.0,"Alright, thanks. Just curious, have you had experience with no-contact? Did it work? Did it not work? Etc."
relationships,fdj30eo,t1_fdj2frt,1578457108.0,"I just feel that what her and I had deserves a second chance. I know that we both felt feelings toward eachother that we’d never felt before and it’s hard to ignore that. Maybe I’m just being immature. 

Also my dad has had the sweater since I was a baby, I’m not willing to just leave it"
relationships,fdj2qz1,t1_fdj2ict,1578456921.0,It’s just so DIFFICULT not to. It’s so hard not to think that what I had with this person was special and that it deserves a second chance
