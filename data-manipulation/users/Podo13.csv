news,fgulb50,t3_f0ap7o,1581123654.0,Interesting to see so many people having such a warm winter. I feel like this year is more wintery than 2 years ago here in St. Louis.
hockey,fgujfm0,t1_fgui6rv,1581122303.0,"Doesn't really show how dynamic he can be in the offensive zone. He's had several plays he starts lead to goals, but end up getting no points for it. 

His TOI is also all over the place. Doesn't have a defined role and that isn't the best for a young guy."
stlouisblues,fgueaap,t1_fgtj3s3,1581118694.0,"Agreed. But Berube has already shown that he won't bend his system to bring out a player's potential with Fabbri. This is the exact thing I was terrified about after his usage of Fabbri. 

You play his way, and that's it."
hockey,fgt06dj,t1_fgsz5vt,1581096300.0,"Yep. Especially back then. Athletes were fairly fit, but nothing like that. Same with [Bobby Hull](http://hockeygods.com/system/gallery_images/8499/normal.jpg?1340222707) being an absolute unit from working on his farm and beating his wife during the offseason.

It's one of the big reasons they were so dominant. It was kind of like they were over agers in junior."
hockey,fgsvid6,t3_f0crb2,1581093520.0,Bummer that Tarasenko won't make it back in time to stay a part of this group (he does have 20+ for the previous 6 seasons though).

hockey,fgsko5h,t1_fgsjio8,1581086727.0,"No, not really, I just don't think he thinks through what he wants to do before getting the puck on his stick. He just doesn't seem to have an NHL speed offensive IQ. 

For example, instead of waiting in front of the goal thinking ""top corner, blocker side"", adjusting as the puck is coming to him to make that shot happen and letting his instincts take over, he waits until he gets the puck. So now, he has to take the time to think ""top corner, blocker side"", then adjust to take the shot, and then shoot. And if he notices he has a bad angle or something, his adjustments to get a better one or get around a defender seemed very inefficient.

It really only adds a couple extra fractions of a second, but in the NHL that's a lot of time for defenders to get their sticks or bodies in the way and for goalies to square up to the puck.

Imo, he's very good on the forecheck because it doesn't require much thinking - he can just let his body take over and stays extremely tenacious - and he's great at keeping the puck on his stick because he has the time to think about what he wants to do and execute, but when it comes to scoring he always seemed to give the goalie an easy save or get his shot blocked."

fantasyfootball,fgshk11,t1_fgsd4w4,1581084499.0,"Not to mention that 1 catch for 20 yards and a TD is 9 points in probably 10 seconds of game time while the 7 catches for 20 yards is 2-3 quarters worth of the game, meaning there is far greater potential for more points with the TD situation than with the 7 catches.

They're the same at the end of the game but in-game they are extremely different, especially if you're can easily expect more than 1 catch from an RB (some you can safely assume that, some you can't)."

hockey,fgsgf48,t1_fgsfvb6,1581083626.0,"Yeah, he was really good in his first major NHL stint with us (13 goals in 54 games as a 21-year old wasn't bad at all). But, when you look a little closer, the same reason he's doing well in the KHL is probably why he excelled at first in the NHL too.

When he was relatively unknown, he wasn't paid any mind and was given the time and space needed for him to hit his ceiling. Then, once opponents started to pay attention to him and took that space away, his production plummeted. 

Even just in his 1st season you can see it. 11 of those 13 goals came in his first 36 games with ave ATOI of 12 minutes. Then he only had 2 goals in his remaining 18 games even though his ATOI was up to 14:25. 

He ended up with only 13 more goals in his next 229 games (his next 4 seasons combined)."
hockey,fgsflnl,t3_f0ajwj,1581082986.0,"He was amazing on the forecheck, could keep possession of the puck on his stick through some crazy shit, and could almost always get the puck in front of the net. His problem was that he just had extremely slow hands when it came to finishing.

He has more time and space to tell his hands what to do in the KHL."
