You’re probably just eating too many calories and overestimating how many you’re actually burning when you work out. You’ve stayed around the same weight so you’re most likely eating at maintenance + exercise just now which is around 2400 for you it seems.

loseit,ffdbxm4,t3_eszvv4,1579817602.0,"Google tdee calculator, input your height/weight etc. And select sedentary for now. This tells you how many calories your body burns a day just by existing and basic movements like walking around the house etc. Subtract 500-1000 from that number to lose 1-2 lb a week. Trying to lose any more than that a week can be too fast and hard on your gallbladder and a sign you’re not eating enough. Men shouldn’t eat less than 1500 calories a day, and that’s usually only recommended for shorter men, or men who are very sedentary. I’d keep exercise calories separate, if you feel like you need some extra calories after a workout then try and only add half of those calories back and keep in mind that cardio machines can often overestimate how many calories you’ve burned, same with fitbits etc."

Depending on how many patients they have that could add extra time. It’s usually around 3 weeks wait, but I’ve waited 5 weeks before because my ortho received their plan and he then went in and made some specific changes, it gets sent back to them to factor in the changes like attachments being removed or in different positions etc. Add in Christmas and New Years and there’s extra time where delays can happen. Hopefully they come in soon for you!"
Invisalign,ffd9db3,t3_esyqno,1579815985.0,"Invisalign recommends changing every 7 days. Some orthos still say 14 days because that’s what they’re used to, or they want to make sure that patient is being totally compliant with wear time etc. Your ortho trusts you to be fine with 7 day changes so don’t worry about it! Some people on here have relatively straight teeth at the start, but it’s their bite that needs corrected or their back teeth moved more so than the front which can take longer than just aligning the front teeth. There’s also a chance that you’ll need refinements after you complete your initial set of trays anyway. Are the missing attachments on your back teeth or are they on the back of your front top teeth? If they’re the second one then they might actually be bite ramps that correct deep bites. They aren’t meant to have anything actually on the tooth, just the bumps on the trays. Not everyone experiences pain, it doesn’t mean your teeth aren’t moving. I had super minor pain with each new tray, like just slight pressure and my teeth moved fine. Everyone’s pain tolerance is different.

Edit: you could probably email your provider with any questions and see if they get back to you. To see your clincheck your ortho needs to email you the link and a password so you can view it. Not all orthos are comfortable doing this as some people become fixated on the simulation and get disappointed when things aren’t 100% as it predicted."

New exercise will probably be making your muscles retain water, a week isn’t enough time to see progress you’ll need to continue for 3-4 weeks.

news,ffbok56,t1_ffbo1g0,1579775844.0,"I’ll agree that a teenager who is overweight might stay indoors and become less active. But a 5 year old doesn’t become obese without their parents feeding them too much. At that age parents are the ones doing the cooking and portioning out the food. A five year old cant just walk down to mcdonalds and buy 3 Big Macs every day, but their parents can over feed them either through thinking they’re being loving by letting them have unhealthy snacks in excess or by just not being aware of appropriate meal sizes for a kid that age. Kids who are overweight before they’re in high school are that way because parents and guardians have allowed them to eat too much for their age/activity level. 

Once they have their own money and ability to buy their own snacks then sure its harder to control their diets, but the habits are often already ingrained long before they reach their teens. Lots of kids stay healthy weights because they’ve been raised to eat appropriate amounts and/or be active enough for their diet. 

If your kid is suffering pain due to being obese and can no longer play and be as active as their friends then you need to help reduce their calories and get them active again, you don’t just accept it and blame genetics and let them suffer until they’re adults and it’s no longer your problem. 

Ultimately your body cannot create fat without an excess of energy in the form of calories. Otherwise we’d be studying these genetically obese people who gain weight whilst barely eating to try and help starving children around the world."

If the novel/film instead told the story of what actual women do on that situation I.e. go along with it indefinitely or break up and find someone else it would be a really boring story that nobody would have wanted to watch.

If you’re morbidly obese that’s going to be way too low for you to start eating at. You need to get rid of all the junk food in your house, of course you’re going to want to eat burritos if you have them at easy access. You need to eat mostly vegetables, lean meats, healthy fats. Google tdee calculator and input your data, this tells you how many calories you’re eating a day to stay the weight that you are right now. Subtract 500-1000 from that number to lose 1-2 lbs a week. Weigh all of your food with a food scale and put it into myfitnesspal or a similar app. If you start to feel hungry drink water, eat some carrots, have tea or coffee, do something distracting like play a video game or go for a walk. You will not starve just because you haven’t eaten in 4 hours."

Children can’t go and buy their own junk food in the amounts it takes to become overweight when they are supposed to be super active and playing. It’s like 80% diet.

Invisalign,ffaoyy9,t3_esgf5a,1579741091.0,Your orthodontist should examine and X-ray your teeth and make the call of whether or not your teeth are healthy enough to withstand treatment. All I’ll say is that if you do go through with treatment - you really need to wear your retainer after finishing. I’ll assume your teeth relapsed after braces due to not wearing your retainer anymore.
Invisalign,ffaonsx,t3_esi369,1579740885.0,I used denture cleaning tablets all the way through my treatment and for my retainers afterwards. I use them around 1-2 times a week and just gently brush the trays everyday as well.
Invisalign,ffaoizy,t3_esjgr1,1579740793.0,"I don’t know if express would be enough trays, it’s capped at 10 which really isn’t a lot. I think it only provides one round of refinements as well. If the price isn’t too much higher I’d just got for full/comprehensive. Even if you think you’re teeth aren’t too bad there could be underlying bite issues that need corrected as well."
Invisalign,ffao07z,t3_esl46x,1579740440.0,"Sounds like a normal amount of trays to me, and 10-11 attachments is not a lot there’s people with attachments on every single tooth and some with two per tooth here. I had invisalign lite and had 13 attachments for a mild case. Nobody can see the attachments trust me. I had two on my top front tooth and my boyfriend literally could not see them until his face was practically in mine and I was pointing directly at them. Someone sitting across a desk really isn’t going to notice and if they do they’re not going to be like “eww she is bettering herself”. Everyone who found out I had invisalign just talked about how jealous they were and how much they also wanted it and asked for advice. 

If your teeth truly look worse and you aren’t just being overly critical then you need to explain those concerns to your orthodontist. Did you get to view your clincheck? What does it look like/how do your teeth compare to what it shows?

Edit: also I can’t tell from your photo if that’s your natural bite or not, but if that’s your natural bite then you have an open bite which would explain any lengthening of treatment as bites are more complex to fix than just straightening teeth."
loseit,ffanimw,t3_esi2x5,1579740111.0,"You say you eat a lot of fast food/junk food. If you have the energy and motivation to leave the house to buy those foods then you have the energy to not order 4 servings worth. You’re 400+ lbs you don’t need to eat 1200 calories to lose weight. You’ll lose weight eating like 2800 calories. That’s a lot of food for anyone. You will not starve or feel hungry. Only order diet soda or water. Stop wasting your health and money on buying junk. If it isn’t in the house you can’t eat it. If you order a pizza then order a small or medium, not a large. If you normally get 2 burgers then only get 1. If you drink a lot of alcohol then you need to reduce that. It takes less energy to not eat than it does to walk to the store and buy junk, so it’s not just that you’re lacking energy/effort if you’re using it to sabotage yourself."

Take your trays out from the back molars on the inside. Slide your fingernail under the tray on the inside of your teeth at the back molar, it should pop up and then you can pinch the tray with your thumb and finger and pull it up and out (or down and out for the top). I don’t know if you have attachments yet, but sometimes there can be some stress on certain attachments when you remove the trays for a second. 

Not wearing the trays for 4 hours or so every so often (once a month or so) should be okay, but you’ll want to make up the hours by wearing the tray for an extra day for example. You should aim for 22 hours a day, only removing to eat."
