AskReddit,feop0wo,t1_femwkq2,1579303362.0,"I was raised military and have a long family history of military service. I never enlisted for this very reason. 

I will not subject myself to an environment where I can't defend myself from abuse without facing severe consequences. Growing up around military personnel and other dependents, I have heard the stories. Rape, hazing, and harassment are all extremely common and a large part of U.S. military culture, which is sickening. Just because a piece of shit earns a few stripes does not make them any less of a piece of shit."

todayilearned,fefsmcs,t3_eooix0,1579063973.0,"Just to clarify, this was still animal abuse and neglect, eventhough it didn't end with the ostrich being injured.


The ostrich was on Johnny's property, and he admits that he was aware of the ostrich's agressive behavior because its mate had frozen to death the year before, leaving it undersexed. 


Rather than safely remove the ostrich from his facility, Johnny decided he wanted to try beating it down with a stick after a previous encounter. At this point, he would've had the money to call animal control or at least some buddies to help him sedate it.


 Yea, Johnny Cash is a legend and all that, but he was still a walking piece of shit in reality."

Essentially, you level your character up to max level 20, then run various dungeons and kill different mobs for Stat potions. These let you incrementally increase a stat until it reaches max and turns yellow. Sometimes you will get rare Un-tiered items in white bags. I suggest you save these in your vault, but otherwise don't worry about losing tiered items!

As newbies, I would focus on unlocking all the classes and obtaining a good pet (Preferably with Heal + Magic Heal). DO NOT BE AFRAID TO DIE IN THE BEGINNING. Seriously, dying means more fame and more fame means upgrading your pet."
