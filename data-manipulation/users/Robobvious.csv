AskReddit,fel5fn4,t3_epj100,1579214452.0,"Honestly the most fun I've ever had playing a game with another person was in a secret mini-game in an already obscure PS2 title. If you can find or otherwise acquire a copy of Mister Mosquito for PS2 you can enter a cheat code on the main menu to activate a secret BICYCLE COMBAT GAME. And yes, it is as ridiculous and awesome as it sounds. It's two asian men on top of a tall pillar in the sky that's about the size of a sumo ring. Both men are on bikes and to play you have to peddle and steer to crash into your opponent and knock him off the ring, whereupon he falls pedaling furiously into the abyss. My Dad and I would play rounds to a hundred and just crack up over and over as we tried to knock each other off this pillar. The best parts were when I would wait for him to fill up his turbo meter and come at me and I'd jump over him at the last second so he'd go sailing off at top speed. XD 

I found some footage on youtube [here.](https://youtu.be/WGtMEejZiIM) But honestly it doesn't do it justice, you just have to try it for yourself. Trust me on this!

That's why I specifically recommend the Genesis version as there's another version on another console but the music isn't as good. It was a staple of my childhood growing up.
