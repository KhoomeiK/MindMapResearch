He should wear a collar and drag a lead until you can redirect with verbal commands and break his concentration. 

I used a game called get it! to work on redirection and saw a lot of improvement.  My dog is leash reactive. You will need some patience, a high value treat (really smelly treat like hot dog or lunch meat) and the leash. Do a couple intros while calm, before the distraction happens. Just say ‘Get it!’ And throw the treat on the ground. The first few times may take a while (like multiple treats thrown) but soon he should hear get it! And start looking around on the ground for treats. Just repeat repeat and over time he will see something exciting and immediately turn to you instead"

Dogtraining,fee4nya,t1_fee1met,1579026317.0,"I’m familiar with that, haha. Google the ‘Nothing in life is free’ dog training philosophy. It helps practice and reinforce the eye contact/attention because they have to do something (sit, wait, etc) before getting anything and it teaches them to look to you for instructions before acting on impulses. It’s a lot of work, but consistency is key!"
