AskReddit,fgnrhj6,t1_fgnpvx1,1580951282.0,"Okay, I want to preface this with a blanket disclaimer that I am not saying this to be a political statement. That said, Trump has repeatedly demonstrated disconcerting neurological signs.

Various anonymous sources from within the White House have all stated that he is showing concerning, almost dementia like symptoms and behaviors. These reports could easily be dismissed as backstabbing gossip and fearmongered, so it is hard to tell if this has any accuracy. 

Recently, he was spotted stumbling on the wet steps of Air Force One upon exiting the plane, seeming to require effort to maintain his balance. Now, as the steps were wet from rain, that was easily dismissed by many. However, shortly after, eyewitnesses and physicians to view the tape both noted that he dragged one foot while walking.

Others have pointed to his interviewing and speech skills. His speaking patterns have changed since the 80s, becoming more disjointed. Many have noted odd pronounciations and slurred words in addition to the coherency issues. Taken out of context, this may seem like a particular speech pattern to him, but many have argued that there is a marked difference/deterioration seen in his current interviews by compare to those filmed in the 80s and 90s. 

Does this mean Trump has dementia or a degenerative neurological condition? Not necessarily. We aren't privy to the kind of medical information necessary to be sure. However, there are certainly enough little red flags to raise concern."

A disabled blogger once wrote that the reason why it's easy to say ""Why don't you try X?"" or ""You just need to Y"" is because we all like to believe that we can control our fate by our choices and actions.

However, Alex lead us to believe that complex thoughts and emotions aren't limited to humans. Alex once asked questions about himself (looked in a mirror and asked, ""What color?"") 

He also seemed to have a concept of a zero. They would put an assortment of colored blocks out and ask how many of a color these was or what color had X amount of pcs out. One day, he seemed bored and kept giving the wrong answer of 5 (when there were no colors with five pcs out). Dr. Pepperberg finally asked, ""What color five?"" and got the curious answer of ""none."" 

He famously invented a word used by bird keepers everywhere; the ""banerry."" He began to ask for a ""banerry."" It took them some trial and error before figuring out he wanted an apple.
