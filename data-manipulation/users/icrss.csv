I also had low vitamin D, and something about T3 and T4 wasn't quite right (those two are hormones related to metabolism). My doctor explained to me that all of that together was stopping me from being as active as I should be, since I my body age was 47 even though I'm 18 (I don't know how they do that but hey)."
