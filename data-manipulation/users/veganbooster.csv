Also, in my opinion the way tinder works isn’t for everyone. I used it for a bit and didn’t like it at all. Maybe try starting a new hobby with a club, or joining a club for a hobby you already have.

It sounds like it might be a bit of a emotionally abusive relationship. I’ve been in one before and when you’re in it, it is sometimes tricky to realise. You need to remember that you are important, and how you feel is important. Can you honestly imagine feeling this way towards him for the rest of your life? You deserves someone who loves you. You are still young, you have time to get a decent job and earn a good wage. Don’t worry about starting over, in my opinion you will be happier. I wish you luck."
