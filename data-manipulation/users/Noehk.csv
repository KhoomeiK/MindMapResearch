todayilearned,fcy656m,t1_fcy4wun,1578075292.0,"Não percebeste ou tás só a responder por responder? O ""choradinho"", que na verdade é na brincadeira e sem qualquer fundo real de queixa, é que a tradução do nome parte da versão espanhola do nome e não da versão portuguesa. Napoleão Bonaparte é a versão portuguesa do nome original francês, a mesma coisa para a maioria dos outros nomes, não conheço muitas figuras historicas que por norma usem uma versão noutra lingua para traduzir o nome..."
todayilearned,fcxp9wa,t1_fcxocxh,1578068280.0,"Ferdinand Magellan is the English version of ""*Fernando de Magallanes* "" which in turn is the Spanish version of his original Old Portuguese name ""Fernão de Magalhães"". Again, point being that everyone knows him by the Spanish version of his name because he served the Spanish crown on **that** endeavour."

Still pissed people called him ""Ferdinand Magellan"" because he worked for the Spanish, his name was Fernão de Magalhães, mofo was Portuguese, just because I work for russians that doesn't mean my name is now Boris Vodkanoff or whatever...

Toxicity refers to the safety of a specific chemical or compound give it's safety dosage.   
Poisoning is the process of giving someone or taking a specific toxic amount of a chemical or compound. 

Eucalyptus bark ***can be toxic if ingested in large amounts*** but ***it's not outright poisonous*** (meaning even a minute amount will kill you).

Hope that clear it up."
