I was commenting on the fallacies exhibited in the reactions to this video, and in particular the problem with using funding and its consequences, like head count, as a proxy for experimental verification. That's not how science works. Look up the replication crisis in psychology for another example of how pernicious using popularity as a proxy for experimental verification can be.

skeptic,ff6e1u4,t3_erotxh,1579625170.0,"People don't have to be dishonest in order for groupthink and selective funding to operate. If you take 1000 scientists who have a range of ideas, and fund the subset of them that hold a particular view, rinse and repeat, pretty soon all the funded work will be done under that assumption.

This doesn't say whether that view is right or not. It's a general problem with our current funding model, and has caused issues in a variety of fields. E.g., in Alzheimer's Disease research, the funding agencies basically funded work based on a particular assumption as to the cause, and this sidelined other approaches. Recently it turned out that the dominant (and well funded) approach was wrong, and the other funding-starved approach was right. There are lots of similar examples in psychology and a variety of other fields.

Is this an issue in climate science? I dunno, and it's not really relevant to what the scientific truth is. But it does make me raise an eyebrow at the whole ""almost all the working (ie, funded) climate scientists agree that X, and not believing in X makes you a crank and cranks don't get funded and should probably be arrested"" chain of logic. To convince me, you have to get down and dirty with the data."

The force ramps up quickly, because people systematically underestimate how hard they're hitting someone else. Basically, the same event feels harder to the recipient than to the actor.

The defensive strike is abrupt, fast, and violent, the prey is slammed during the strike and again against the ground, and may be fatally injured even prior to constriction.
