That’s at least the second or third large study to confirm it. Sorry. It’s just true. Keto people keep claiming that it is addictive because they largely want to feel like they have the best diet and it also justifies the lack of self control that brought them to keto in the first place. 

Carbohydrates are your preferred energy source. Need is overstating it. Your body and brain run better on them (hence why getting into ketosis is such a bitch). The need part is entirely individual and based on the person. I personally do best with my protein at 1gram per lb of body weight, and my fats and carbs split about 30% (so basically 40% of calories from protein, 30-ish from carbs, 30-ish from fats). Other people I know do way better at 40% or more of their calories from carbs. 

As far as dieting leading to yo-yo weight gain ... fad diets lead to yo yo weight gain which is rough on your body. It’s better to lose 20lbs out of 80 and keep it off then lose 90lbs and gain back 100lbs.
