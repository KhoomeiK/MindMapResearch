What do we do about that proactively?  Perhaps limiting guns to anybody with an arrest record of domestic violence or a history of mental health issues.  I dunno?  

It’s nice to see that we agree on most things.  What’s sad is that most people don’t realize that we all want the same things despite the d or r associated with our votes.

I’m also stuck on the fact that, despite the history of malfeasance, and the generalized corruption we’re seeing at the federal level not enough people are motivated to act.

I want corporations out of politics, I want the electoral college stopped, and I’d love to see actual checks and balances occurring.  

Fuck gerrymandering, down with lobbyists, and to hell with white washed bribery at the federal level.  This country and its leaders are supposed to represent the goals of the populace not the reelection dreams of bought and paid for figureheads.
