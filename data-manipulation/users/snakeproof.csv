Multicopter,ffk61nq,t1_ffjju4y,1580017041.0,"That's pre-planned though, you'd have to know the route the car planned on taking from the start, or be in a chase car within range to update the mission, or just fly manually. It sounds like a crock."
BoltEV,ffk4j5o,t1_ffjz8py,1580015610.0,"It's an unpopular opinion but look into the 2nd/3rd gen Prius, for that kind of commute it's perfect, has plenty of time to warm up fully and get the full 55mpg, and they can be had right now for under 10k every day because gas is cheap, when gas goes high the Prius prices skyrocket. 

If the dealer is eager for anything be very wary, they are a business after all and if they are excited you are probably getting shafted."
cars,ffk3jmd,t1_ffk2nvz,1580014712.0,"A hybrid would perform much better on a track, you're getting the endurance of the ICE and the boost of the electric system. And off the track the electric can offset the ICE and boost efficiency. 

Even with mods most people are lucky to get a 20% increase in power outside of a few good platforms(hello 2J), with an electric you're only battling heat, run a higher pack voltage and you can push a motor way beyond it's stock power limits.

There's a guy on here who was able to get almost 400Whp out of a stock Lexus GSh hybrid transmission, mind you that's the transmission only(it has motors in it) and not counting ICE output, he actually ran just the transmission and no engine."
personalfinance,ffjt1f4,t1_ffjmllr,1580006162.0,"This can be both a good or terrible idea, having owned many cars and seeing friends do this, I'd rather have my car that I know what's wrong than a different one where I have no idea what's going to fail on me, and starting a new job is a bad time to be late due to new car issues and unexpected repair costs."
Multicopter,ffjrtav,t1_ffjmsah,1580005226.0,"Exactly, commercial use should be limited to delivery/film production (arri Alexa and the like)/anything heavy lift that's outside our typical AP drones. I really just want an Inspire 2 RAW and not have to deal with this legal shit."

You can definitely push them beyond stock, that's how Tesla was able to push a firmware update and get better lap times, and if the inverter doesn't support it you can swap it for one that does.

People are swapping in Tesla drive units with Chevy volt batteries, there's a whole new world of modding coming."
