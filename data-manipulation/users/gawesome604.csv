I feel like we're in some crazy cultural/technological/societal revolution for the past 5ish years and no one really knows what the hell to do or say from governments to corporations to us average folks without erupting into some controversy magnified by the internet. 

I think it's best to remember to step back and just live your own life without being consumed by all the nonsense and controversy in the world and on the internet shouting and arguing with random strangers. You still have your personal relationships, hobbies, career and life goals to live for without being sucked into taking all these political/societal tribalistic sides."

The internet paired with smartphones is one big marketing machine and marketplace made to tickle our emotional/shopping urges in the western world. You can never escape it.

AskReddit,ffalnsy,t1_ffa4fg6,1579738849.0,"All true. Like the chinese government, it's part of a long term strategic plan to guilt trip us into taking care of them when they are old and retired. I call it 'long term emotional leverage'. Also they hate debt. Makes them look bad too. That's why they'll WANT to chip in for major life purchases like your cars and, most likely, your future house (because we all know how expensive those are now in any major cities...). And it all starts with you having a nice education and then nice paying professional career first!

I'm 32..my newly bought duplex is partially funded by my parents. Obviously I couldn't buy it by myself without their help. Funny enough, they moved back into my house with a rent-able studio area in the first floor. At least I can say I own property in one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world BUT they won't ever leave me alone until they die. At least they can brag to friends/family that their only son owns a house now. 😂

After being in a few fender benders in my lifetime, it always stings/hurts initially but as you're safe, the car did it's job protecting you, and it's NOT your fault, that's the best damn situation. Insurance, the law, and the shop of your choice will deal with the rest.

And we're all fed the kool aid through government officials/media that gets psychologically engrained in our minds.

Now it's the Chinese now that they're a geopolitical superpower and the wealthy/business folks gobbles up real estate and diversifies all over the world. Or Iran with the currently political climate.

5 snowy winters later on winter tires and progressively harsher snow events in my city (full of hills and steep slopes) that it's pushing my lowered FRS to it's limits especially when main roads aren't completely plowed in the morning when everyone needs to get to places.

As much as I like to plow the streets for others, once you're dragging too much harden snow, you can feel the grip and traction struggling over time as your commute gets longer. I managed to get stuck on winters 5m away from my office parking entrance during the last major snowfall last week. But thank god for winters I was able to finesse my way out. 😅

Don't get me wrong, it handles and controls beautifully on snow with winter tires...when it's not TOO deep and you WANT to have some fun in nice open and/or controlled environments. Not on busy city roads where drivers around you don't know what to do or are less competent than you.

In traditional immigrant families such as mine, they willingly do it (which they have been saving for years), force you to take (especially if university tuition or a home down payment since debt/interest is seen as a financial nightmare) and will use it as psychological leverage to guilt trip and long-game you to take care of them when they are old and retired. It hits you like a ton of bricks once you hit your late 20s to 30s when you're fully matured (for the most part) or become a young parent and realise the amount they invested in you to be successful in the western world.

Trace it back to their childhood. Family life growing up? Parents? Grandparents? Broken family? Single parents? Absent parents? Product of divorce? Victims of abuse by family, family-friends, religious upbringing/indoctrination, etc. Everyone is product of their environment growing up and how they were raised. Sometimes, it's already fucked before it began and those are the most tragic stories. One can't go back in time and stop grandpa from abusing dad who in turn abused you. The psychological and historic scars run so deep that some can go a lifetime without realizing it because it's systemic and it's a cycle of misery over and over in their lifetime and passed onto future generations.

Kudos to those who dug deep into their hearts and minds and dealing with negative memories that are buried DEEP to pull themselves out of these situations that scarred them for life.

It's a good way to document something that you worked hard on to reflect in the future. I'm sure he asked for permission before filming people.
