For example, in the high profile Brett Kavanaugh supreme court appointment, the media constantly referred to the witness Christine Blasey Ford as 'credible' because of the conviction in which she spoke and her body language, which they implied strengthened her arguments. This is obviously absurd because it is superficial and has nothing to do with her arguments or testimony. In the same way, the media likes to label people 'credible' or not depending on equally silly metrics."

If people immigrate here legally and integrate productively into society then that's great, but I have no sympathy for criminals.

Taking medication or getting a service animal is easy, but at the end of the day it takes hard work to improve yourself to any real degree.

The correct response is improving your lifestyle to alleviate your symptoms. For example, when I was 20 and struggling in university I started to experience insomnia and panic attacks regularly, in addition to severe anxiety. I started taking care of myself better - exercising, watching my diet, taking my social life seriously and getting out more, and my anxiety went down drastically. I do not think the proper response to anxiety is medication or service animals in most cases, this seems like treating the symptoms rather than the cause. If you're overweight, socially isolated, eat fast-food every day, struggling over some real stress in life like school - you WILL be anxious and have mental health issues, it's virtually guaranteed. The solution isn't a band-aid like medication or a service animal, it's genuinely improving your life and I don't think indulging in people's victim mentality actually helps them. In certain extreme cases or in cases of real physiological depression or anxiety, medication or a service animal might be appropriate at a physician's recommendation, but I think those cases are very rare."

That's a good point about people taking time off to pursue further education. In my opinion, post-secondary education is already inexpensive enough that it incentivizes pursuing academic degrees in fields that will absolutely never contribute to your personal wealth growth or the economy.

Although you could argue that these funds would have been spent in the economy by the government anyways, so it's really a re-distribution rather than simply printing money. I'm not sure that makes sense though."
creepy,ffcntxx,t1_ffcew4u,1579803420.0,"That's the problem - how do you draw the line where life begins? Heartbeat? Brain waves? Fingernails? I don't think individual judgment calls are a good way to decide who lives and who dies. I also don't think medical knowledge helps much in this area - we don't even know if the soul exists much less measure that scientifically, so it's not obvious that a doctor's opinion is relevant here. In my opinion, the only time we know for sure that human life has begun is at conception."

prolife,ffcafxq,t1_ffbv8s3,1579795193.0,"We have a similar problem in Canada where the Conservative party is the only pro-life party, but it's even worse here because the party knows that they will never win a federal election if they include pro-life in the party platform, so the party has no official stance. To add, the leader of the Liberal party in power has stated he is personally against abortion, but his party is for full abortion rights up to birth and he even campaigned on it. I don't understand that."
canada,ffc9mp9,t1_ffc4e4o,1579794683.0,No I didn't. Guess that shouldn't come as much of a surprise then.
creepy,ffc943f,t1_ffc4xzi,1579794355.0,"Well, at risk of being sucked into another abortion debate, it isn't very consistent to say that late-term abortion is a great crime but the exact same procedure a couple of months earlier is completely fine. I don't buy that logic.

You raise a good point that the artificial womb could be a good alternative for abortion for someone who doesn't want the child."

creepy,ffc3ny3,t1_ffc373l,1579790746.0,"For a time maybe, once the technology works for premature babies the date of viability will be pushed back earlier and earlier, that's pretty much inevitable. Look at the advances in viable pre-mature birth, that gets pushed back earlier and earlier every year, it's already at 5.5 months."
canada,ffc2utc,t1_ffc2lh8,1579790164.0,"There are great doctors, but I think the image of doctors being this infallible elite is incorrect or at least outdated. I know some great people that went on to become doctors, including a couple of my cousins, but I also know a lot of people that were just...lame. High IQ, great grades and resume on paper, but sometimes no life experience, weak character and flaky. I think the current admission system does poor job of filtering these people out, and also unnecessarily excludes great candidates."
canada,ffc1b4z,t1_ffb7dcu,1579789013.0,"The medical school admission system is pretty broken. To begin with prioritizing provincial applicants cuts you off from the majority of the country's talent pool. Failing a single course disbarrs you from half the med schools in the country, again a huge amount of talent wasted - how many bright people just messed up a semester when they were 18 and young. Getting through medical is more like jumping through a series of hoops than a test of real ability, intelligence isn't worth much if your doctors have never had a real job in their life and are living in their parents' basements. ""Hospital volunteer work"" which more often than not is standing by the entrance greeting visitors is not very impressive. Really worried about the future of healthcare with this on the horizon."
