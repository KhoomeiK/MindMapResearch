Gamingcirclejerk,fgi4zko,t1_fgf8myv,1580805804.0,"That's fine, it's easy to mistake sarcasm on this sub. I'm not saying cultures can be owned by ethnic races, I just don't see the reason why anyone really WOULD want to celebrate black month if they aren't black. For example, unless you simply wanted to pay respects, I don't see why an Arab would want to celebrate Brazil's day of national independence. It's like their own thing isn't it? Yea you CAN celebrate it if you want but I mean it's not specifically for you so why bother? I mean I'm glad that people get to celebrate their history, especially a history as important as black history, but I feel like Halo is unnecessarily making it a universal celebration with the intention of just trying to make good PR. I mean it's so random lmao. 

That aside it's not something that ticks me off, Halo is a great franchise and the people saying they're gonna boycott the game for something as insignificant as this are pretty stupid. And if you do think Halo supporting black month is a great thing, that's cool, too."
