AlAnon,ff5mj4y,t3_erdwj0,1579600309.0,"My husband abused alcohol for years.. also a glutton with food, caffeine (10 cups a day) , very intense and overkill on anything he does.. it’s a strange thing many addiction sufferers are like this. When he finally quit he replaced with exercise . Slave to his Apple Watch now.eats very weirdly.. lost a lot of weight but yo yos up and down.. eats huge volumes of low calorie foods. Is there an oral gratification need in alcoholics? The habits you describe suggest he was hiding it from you."
AlAnon,ff5lvv0,t3_erl9v4,1579599316.0,"I would get off the journey now, take a different path and save yourself a lot of heartache. This isn’t one you want to raise kids with."
AlAnon,ff5lq3m,t3_eroc64,1579599069.0,"No you are right to stay away. I’d like to ask you if an alcoholic ever really understands the depth of hurt, anger, pain, frustration, betrayal, loss, emotional damage, financial damage and overall destruction to those they supposedly live? Especially when they have lied repeatedly and for many years? Why should they be praised for finally quitting and behaving like the responsible adults the rest of us were all along? Damaged their own kids with their selfish behavior... I don’t think I’ll ever be able to forget . I want to forgive so I can let go of the hate and pain.. but I want him to know how much pain he caused .. just so he could feel good ."
AlAnon,ff5lcen,t3_ergszv,1579598485.0,Good! You will be so glad to be free. Wish I had done this.
AlAnon,ff5l92r,t3_eroybr,1579598345.0,I’ve been lied to so long I feel stupid and angry and very unforgiving. I have made it clear what a total piece of shit he was and being off alcohol one year is a drop in the bucket against 17 yrs of lies and disappointments.
AlAnon,ff5l1oh,t1_ff4z5ev,1579598035.0,Ugh.. they do ruin your life. Alcoholic jerks.  If you don’t have kids then strongly consider leaving.  He sounds like not just alcohol but also mental illness.  He can’t help his problems perhaps but why should you allow him to abuse u?
AlAnon,ff5kwai,t1_fepkxm1,1579597809.0,Leave now before you have kids and much more to lose. They don’t quit unless they want to.
AlAnon,ff5kqgp,t1_fejdj4q,1579597574.0,Leave her.. kick her out. They have to hit rock bottom. Don’t be pulled down with her.
AlAnon,ff5kn9d,t1_fenyqmn,1579597447.0,"Omg.. this reminds me so much of my husband.  Only in our case it went on for many more years.  Its a long story.. I am still so furiously angry at the lies.. the betrayal.  The refusal to admit he was alcoholic, or at minimum an alcohol abuser. A hi functioning one but still an abuser of alcohol. Same sneaky shit. When I was too busy working and taking care of our young kids. So now he’s stopped for 15 months since being discovered.  He replaced the drinking with exercise. I don’t know if I will ever be able to trust him again. Or respect him. My question is whether I’m being too mean.  Now that he has actually quit I’m not able to forgive him for all the pain and suffering he caused and the damage to the family, the time and money he gave to alcohol instead of me or the kids. I hate him.  Yet I don’t want the financial loss and disruption of divorce. He’s a fairly nice person otherwise but I can’t help think how evil he really was to lie for so long.  I feel like I want him to hurt and suffer and feel as badly as he made me feel."
Parenting,fepupqq,t1_femmolk,1579331976.0,"It’s hard, and I delayed having kids longer than I would have liked, (39/42), but I was in a good position career wise when I did.  I’m a Radiologist in large private multi specialty group practice with university affiliation, so we could sell our call to fellows.  After I reached partner they let me cut back to part time with commensurate pay reduction. I worked avg 3 days a wk, 8-5, and no call or weekends.    Husband in tech, worked at home most of the time and we had babysitter as needed.  Now I can also work from home with teleradiology. Things are never perfect but you just keep on trying.  we even did some homeschooling for 5 yrs along with a charter school. Chaotic times but priceless memories.  The oldest kid was just a fast learner, so we had to tailor his education after he skipped a grade. He graduates from college this spring, also did that in 3 yrs.  Younger child went along for the ride and also on track to graduate college at 20.  Honestly would never in a million yrs have considered homeschool but it was great for our family, at the time and for a limited time! Good luck and enjoy those precious little ones!"
