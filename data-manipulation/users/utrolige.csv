polyadvice,feiuooi,t3_ee276r,1579147701.0,"I find this polyamory stuff really interesting.  Can I ask you a question...  Were you two in a monogamous relationship before you opened it up to polyamory?  I feel like if you are in a committed monogamous relationship that gets opened up, the jealousy would be a million times worse than if you went into it sharing a partner from the beginning.  I don't know why I feel this way, just the rise of the whole poly thing made me think about how it would make me feel to be in one, and that is the conclusion I came to.  It seems like it would be very hard to change that one person bond dynamic without a ton of jealousy.  Especially because she can go out and find someone anytime without effort, while you are going to have to put in a lot more work for less.  It seems like a recipe for resentment and jealousy unless it is open from the start.  On an advice level, your feelings matter, and you should deal with them openly, keeping it in will only make it worse and bring you down.  Hope you find what makes you happy."

I just started weights, haven't lost anything yet, but I feel great and think I have lost some inches as well.  Forgive me for being and idiot, but you mentioned the macro calories split, is that Carbs/Fat/Protein?  I'm new to this"

loseit,feeus9b,t1_feetbf7,1579041665.0,"Thats good, I was just throwing that out there.  A lot of people that preach about IF or Keto like to pretend that they are a fix all with no potential hazards.  I just wanted to let you know about one potential issue.  Given your previously poor diet and lack of exercise, it would not be crazy to think it might have had an effect on your gallbladder as well.  I lost most of my weight so far with IF, so I am not a downer on it, but I will have to have my gallbladder removed at some point.  IF at worst was a cause, at best it just sped the timeline up really fast.  Good luck with everything, I am pulling for you!"
nafld,feesmwu,t1_exazm2p,1579040345.0,"That is awesome to hear, congrats!  I was told I had advanced fatty liver in May, and no one ever fully explained what that meant.  I'm glad advanced does not mean irreversible. Is the list much different than the other lists you find on websites like Mayo?  Also, did you do anything else?  I am fully committed to getting rid of this nonsense, and will do whatever it takes.  My gastro pretty much just said eat better and lose weight.  Very unhelpful.  I don't have fb, and it won't let me see anything when I go to the link."

FattyLiverNAFLD,fee875o,t3_ekq1xc,1579028401.0,"Like someone said, it could be your gallbladder.  I had some of those symptoms with my gallbladder issues.  If you are by chance doing intermittent fasting, I would stop it and see if it clears up at all.  If you are doing IF and have a malfunctioning gallbladder, it will cause issues.  Pale stool usually means bile isn't getting to where it needs to be if I am not mistaken"
loseit,fece322,t1_fec5w24,1578971719.0,"You might want to speak with your gastro about fasting if you still have your gallbladder.  I burned mine out fasting.  it is actually how they found my fatty liver.  They thought it was gallstones, but it turned out that it was my gallbladder not operating properly.  Fasting makes it worse, because it slows and reduces its contractions which leads to things like bile/sludge building up.  If you don't have a gallbladder, i would say go for it 100%.  If you do, be very mindful of any symptoms you have on the mid to upper right side of your body.  The last thing you want to add to all of this is needing to get your gallbladder removed"
loseit,fecdaf6,t1_fecaf56,1578971212.0,I was told to eat foods with omega 3 fats like walnuts and salmon.  Did your gastro tell you to stay away from all fats?  I worry that I am taking this more seriously than my gastro.  Have you had a fibrosis test to see if there is scarring?
loseit,feccwsi,t3_eocemh,1578970976.0,"You are not alone man.  I had a similar experience in may.  Went in for a scan of my gallbladder and they found an enlarged fatty liver.  I'm glad you made this post.  I never posted, but I tell everyone I know that I think might be headed down that road.  After reading about NAFLD, and how it is becoming more prevalent, I couldn't believe that more has not been said about it.  Fortunately my labs weren't too bad, and I got the chance to correct my A1C and LDL before having to go on meds.  I still have NAFLD, and am doing everything I can to keep it from progressing.  Hang in there man, you can do this.  Try to think of the positive that you found out in time to do something about it.  I know it is a huge wake up call for me, and the changes in my diet and exercise has made life soooo much better.  This is your opportunity now too, take your life and health back!"
loseit,fe6l4db,t1_fe4prqt,1578894516.0,"Wow, thank you for taking the time to provide this information!  I really appreciate it.  Yes, I weigh or measure foods most of the time.  When I don't, it is usually like a salad with high nutritional values and negligible calories or something I have made a million times.  Like, I eat the same breakfast and lunch most days, so, I don't measure those dishes all the time.  Steel cut oats, almond milk, walnuts or flaxseed, banana or berries and ceylon cinnamon, 4 cups of coffee, half cup of cottage cheese.  Lunch is usually homemade grilled chicken tacos..  

&#x200B;

Yowza, that's a lot of protein.  I know I need to up it though, my intake was probably half that before I started consciously trying to eat more.  Do the fats need to be reduced if they are healthy fats?  I know my fats are high percentage wise, but they come mostly from almonds, walnuts, olive oil (dressing), sunflower or flax seeds and avocado.  I have NAFDL, and was eating these along with salmon 3x a week because they are supposed to be good for it.  Maybe I am overdoing it.  I just want to reverse it ASAP.

&#x200B;

Will definitely start trying to time the carbs, i did not know that.  I did go for a brisk walk whenever I ate something really bad carb heavy though, but I do it mostly to mitigate any blood sugar spikes.

&#x200B;

I have been doing a full body beginner workout 3-4 times a week for the last 4 or 5 weeks, but feel like it may be time to change it up and maybe start splitting up the days.  Do you have any suggestions on that?  Thanks!"
loseit,fe3bxm3,t1_fe2jm3t,1578847919.0,"Sure!  Which aspect of the calories are you interested in?  Yesterday, my total calories were 2030.  My macros were carb 40% (192g), Fat 35% (74g) and Protein 25% (118g).  This is what my new weightlifting diet typically looks like.  Before, I didn't get enough protein, so I replaced carbs with more protein (lots of low sodium cottage cheese).   Notable nutrients that I try to control or which weren't good, Fiber 39g, Sugars 56g (5g added), Sodium 2,600 mg, Potassium 1878 mg, Sat Fat 17g and Iron I only got 53% of my daily recommended.  I struggle to get iron because I don't eat much red meat anymore, and i need to work on my sodium potassium balance.  I eat 3 meals with 2 or 3 snacks throughout the day.  I lost most of my first 80 lbs doing IF, but it burned out my gallbladder.  Now I have to eat something every couple hours to keep it emptying or suffer pain and discomfort.  Let me know if you want anything else.  Thanks for any input, I appreciate it

EDIT: I was at about 1850 near the end of the day so I had a fiber bar, and cottage cheese to reach the 2000, those weren't logged in the macros, it would also bring my added sugars up to 14g total"
loseit,fdyx8cg,t1_fdxycmq,1578784479.0,"Thanks for the information.  Someone else briefly touched on this, but this added a little meat to it.  I think I am on week 4 or 5 right now, so hopefully I will start seeing it drop shortly."

There has definitely been a change, after the first week where it was kind of miserable, I feel great afterwards.  I feel stronger, more confident, more energy and the biggest change has been my posture.  I have zero desire for huge muscles, in fact, I don't want them at all, but I love this feeling and confidence.  Sleep is the one achilles heel I have right now.  I cannot get a good night's sleep to save my life."

loseit,fdxfg27,t1_fdx9wmj,1578768191.0,"Sounds like you have some experience with this.  Once those gains taper, is it just about maintaining from there on?  Do you switch to lower weight and higher reps at that point?  I am completely new to weight training, and have been doing 3 sets of weight that makes me fail in the 10-12 rep range.  What did you do when the gains tapered or just do in general.  I love the way weight lifting has made me feel, and I want to keep it up."
loseit,fdxd5vo,t1_fdx6a97,1578767617.0,"Thanks, didn't know about the water retention aspect.  Calorie deficit is definitely there,  I had to consciously eat more food to up my caloric intake to \~2000 each day.  I did that to support the extra training.  I have NAFLD and a slow gallbladder so I have to be very conscious of what I eat, and not to lose weight too fast.  Thanks for the info on the monitors too."
loseit,fdxb7m0,t1_fdx5xi9,1578767105.0,"I think this is true in the long term, but in researching this, starting from scratch with weight training, it seems you can make significant gains the first month or so while still losing weight.  My calorie deficit is good, I spend 1-2 hours at the gym each day, usually between two visits.  I have upped my calories intake to 2000/day the last week just because I feel like I needed more nutrition for the activity levels I was doing.  I'll take a look at it again though, thanks for taking the time to comment"
loseit,fdxafzs,t1_fdx6eo6,1578766889.0,"Thanks for the information, I will look into them again.  I think I might be higher than that bodyfat percentage though.  Either way, I can handle lack of accuracy, as long as there is some consistency.  I would look at it like a fitness monitor, it isn't perfect, but it still gives me an idea of how I am doing that day relative to other days"
loseit,fdx8ydx,t1_fdx4y81,1578766436.0,"I used to think this, but a few weeks ago when I really started to level off, I did some research, and if you are just starting weightlifting, it seems you can gain significant muscle while losing fat in the beginning.  It tapers off, but the first month or so, the shock to the system allows for it to happen.  Thanks for the tape measure suggestion, I will start taking some measurements tonight"

Also, forgive yourself girl, don't get defeated or down on yourself, just start trying to move a little in the right direction each day and let it snowball.

I moved away from my hometown and was really craving our local pizza so i found a copycat recipe for one of the local pizza joints.  It took more than a few times to get it right, but the mistakes were edible, and eventually I did.  I then found copycats for a few more things I was missing, and it took off from there.  Now I'll try any recipe that doesn't employ advanced techniques.  I can also look at a label of ingredients, and reverse engineer a lot of things without the chemicals/additives.  You will be surprised how quickly you get the hang of it.  I've been at it for less than a year.  There are so many copycat recipes and youtube tutorials, I would say just find one for something you like and try it.  I would also get an instant pot for the times when you just want to throw a handful of ingredients in a pot set the pressure/time and be done with it.

That I acted aloof and disinterested when it came to my interactions with women.  I remember her exact words to this day ""you need to let her know that you would like to sleep with her without saying it"". 3. To take chances and not take it personally, that my chances of having someone great fall in my lap without putting myself out there was slim.  The most important thing they did though was help me feel like I was worth it by wanting to help me so much.  All of this together helped me understand that it wasn't me in the sense that I was defective, but it was me in the sense that I was my biggest obstacle.  My guy friends except for one were the people telling me it would just happen.  In their defense, it did seem to just happen for them so it's probably what they believed"

It's funny that this question is coming up because during reflections recently, I thought about the special place in my heart the three people who tried to help have simply because they thought I was worth helping and tried.
