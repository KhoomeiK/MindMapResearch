socialanxiety,fgvmzzn,t1_fgvgf8h,1581150735.0,Idk I feel like that’s unfair to everyone doing the group assignment for me to do solo work.
socialanxiety,fgvdy4o,t1_fgvd636,1581146202.0,Thank you for your words! I appreciate you :-)
socialanxiety,fgvd5cq,t1_fgvcsd7,1581145255.0,Thank you for your compassion. It's nice to know there's other people out there going thru the same struggles. I hope we can both get thru it and finish the stuff we gotta finish :-)
socialanxiety,fgvcpxm,t3_f0j30t,1581144757.0,"Yes, I don't initiate conversations with people I know just in case if I say something wrong. I also try to exit conversations quickly. Typiing this out, I think I've realised I'm kind of a jerk :/"
socialanxiety,fgvch7s,t3_f0mixy,1581144487.0,"From your description he seems like a nice person trying to get to know you, maybe that's why he's trying to talk to you? I dunno, I'm not really good at this stuff."
socialanxiety,fgvc8e9,t1_fgvbyv6,1581144215.0,"OK, thank you."
socialanxiety,fgvc87p,t1_fguywl4,1581144210.0,"It's OK to let out your emotions. Crying isn't pathetic, it's just a release of emotion. Even tho you feel terrible, you're actually very strong for being able to go through this. You're trying your best and that's all that matters. Don't listen to your brain, your brain is lying to you."
socialanxiety,fgvbvss,t3_f0movu,1581143823.0,"I have the same problem and sometimes can't urinate when someone else is in the restroom. I think it's common enough, but someone will have to fact check me."
socialanxiety,fgvb4tw,t3_exkvde,1581143003.0,"I actually dropped a class b/c of a panic attack I had when I entered class 3 minutes late. I entered the room, professor was already lecturing, then I walked to the seats but then turned around and made a beeline for the closest door and left. I was so embarrassed that I actually dropped the entire course, lol. I might drop another course because of my brain’s panicking."

linkiscute,ffdrin6,t3_er9bav,1579827154.0,"I’m split on the favorite outfit question. Gerudo Link is best Link, but also cliche... whereas Royal Guard Link is dashing and beautiful, but not as good as Gerudo Link... oh boy, the choices."
nextfuckinglevel,ffbplmd,t1_ffbk5c6,1579777372.0,"I’d say that it’s 40% hard work and 60% luck. Social status, networks, and other stuff can profoundly change where someone ends up. But, if you take two equally lucky people and one is hard working while the other takes whatever is handed on a silver platter, the hard worker will succeed and the lazy one will wither away into obscurity. There’s so many hard working people that are stuck in dead-end jobs because they weren’t fortunate enough. Now whether luck has divine intervention involved or not is another subject..."
