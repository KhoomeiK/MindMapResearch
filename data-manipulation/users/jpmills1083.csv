AmItheAsshole,fea9ehh,t1_fe8oec3,1578945920.0,I hope a bird shits in your mouth today. Having a vagina does not make you special. You're gross.
facepalm,fdwrqxd,t3_en4d99,1578761729.0,34k upvotes and this is 10 years old. Glad reddit is concerned about reposts
natureismetal,fds5nbi,t3_emsmk9,1578694903.0,My dumb ass thought it was gonna try to fly away with it... Didn't occur to me it either had a nest or wanted to build a nest in there.
unpopularopinion,fdlffzq,t3_eltxmq,1578522869.0,28 watching anime.. All of reddit in one post.
fantasyfootball,fctl6us,t1_fcryz4h,1577947360.0,I wouldn't take aj green in the 10th round. This guy needs to retire he has to have missed more games that he has played due to injuries.
news,fcthtad,t3_einzs7,1577943751.0,I'm not sure why people seem to assume Ohio is a bunch of redneck republicans flaunting guns around.. It's one of the main drug trafficking areas of the United States. But based on these comments people seem to think it was a MAGA hat wearing cow farmer. Ohio is a rough area.
Dreams,fcpmecl,t1_fcpm75j,1577867460.0,Happy new year to you also. Holy shit that could not sound more accurate. Thank you for the explanation for that
Dreams,fcpl7cg,t1_fcpkwwf,1577866747.0,I appreciate it. I'm gonna ride the next one out instead of waking myself up and see what happens
Dreams,fcpkmk9,t1_fcpk5jr,1577866411.0,That's awesome I'm gonna try it. It's crazy I can talk to her and it feels so real. It's the 1 great part of my dreams
Dreams,fcpkh2p,t1_fcpjqh3,1577866319.0,It's ureal tho and it happens nightly. I can literally sit there and talk to my grandmother who died 8 years ago. But I go in my old room and snakes start coming out and biting me and I can literally feel it. Planes fly above the house and explode. My girlfriend is sitting there and will go in the next room and fuck other people and I can't move or do anything (she'd never cheat in real life) I'll be on a beach and look behind me and a 300ft wave is coming.
Dreams,fcpjv77,t1_fcpjqh3,1577865975.0,Not quite sure what you mean
Dreams,fcpjmf2,t1_fcpj2ek,1577865831.0,No. I'm always half way aware I'm dreaming but it feels so real I'm not sure. The dreams are so disturbing I'm terrified. They are nightly terrors. My grandmother was basically my mom growing up so it's awesome being able to talk and interact with her nightly but is also terrifying when other shit happens. It feels like it's happening when dreaming.
Dreams,fcpivgl,t1_fcpipyd,1577865409.0,Yes. I can wake myself up immediately by closing my eyes as hard as I can in my dream and open as fast as I can
todayilearned,fcblexp,t1_fcapau6,1577588223.0,r/brandnewsentence lol a good British comedy. Listening to those horendious accents for more than 2 seconds is worse than water boarding.
todayilearned,fcbiodd,t1_fcawh44,1577587332.0,Holy shit did you just tell a massive group of 30 year old virgins a sci-fi show sucks!?!?
todayilearned,fcbi6ux,t3_egwlvw,1577587170.0,Shit show anyway
unpopularopinion,fcaio81,t3_egsgmz,1577569905.0,"Literally AITAH - A man posts ""I walked in on my wife cheating with our 3 children watching so I kicked her out"" 99% of comments are from women and read.. Yea yta. Maybe you should have noticed how unhappy she is and maybe you are a shitty spouse.

Women posts ""I went full Casey Anthony today and drowned my children but it's because I had a rough past and my husband told me to stop screaming at the waitress last week"". Comments from women read- no honey you did the right thing. Maybe now he won't tell you what you can and can't say to strangers anymore.

To be fair this is almost all reddit users male and female. Toxic neckbeards all around."
