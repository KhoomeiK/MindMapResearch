bipolar,ffgc5ya,t3_etgdba,1579902990.0,"They don't have to be trained to be a therapy pet, right? I'm planning on making my cat one and thought all you needed was an ESA letter from your therapist."
bookclub,ffg6eyb,t3_etg4jf,1579899451.0,"I agree with two of these: not lending or borrowing (what if they hurt mine? What if I want to keep theirs? Actually the last time I borrowed a friend's book...I still have it), and I also don't like reading stories that I find too relatable."

memes,ffasfq0,t3_esjsxa,1579743418.0,"Putting the horrifying crime of torturing aside for just a sec (if one can actually do that), pulling off an antler isn't what it sounds like--deers naturally shed their antlers this time of year so it probably came off quite easily. Weird, right? But yeah these mofos should have gotten way more intense of a punishment."

bipolar,feb6izh,t1_feb5376,1578955845.0,"That's what I thought at first when I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, but I don't think that every time I feel good it's an ""episode"" and that I need to cool my jets...since starting tracking my moods and activities a month ago I'm beginnj g to see that sometimes I feel good BECAUSE I did stuff, not the other way around, y'know? Also, when I'm hypomanic I feel agitation beneath the euphoria, like I haven't done enough or I don't feel in control. Anyway, noticing those differences is helping me enjoy...life more. Instead of looking over my shoulder for the demon every time I'm starting to enjoy it."
bipolar,fea01zk,t3_eo5nfm,1578943010.0,"I think if you're honest at your couple's counseling like you are here, there's no way all the blame can get put on you. Maybe it's not really going to be about finding someone to blame anyway. Counseling can help you feel safe to be honest with each other so you can come to understand each others' pain. If you're going to counseling together in the first place, it means you both want it to work out, and hopefully you both will be willing to put in the work. You got this. I believe in you!"

CasualConversation,fdeyts2,t3_ekwn1q,1578349505.0,"My mom and sister can befriend anyone too! My husband researches the dickens about anything he's interested in and becomes an expert on it in a day.
