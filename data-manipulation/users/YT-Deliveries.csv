Hope is not enough, just as in the Schiavo case.  If we can keep individuals in a living hell (for some value of individual when consciousness no longer exists in a medically understood way) simply because we have hope, how long do we keep them around using up (let's be frank here) resources that people who can actually recover can use.  Medical resources are not infinite.

And, in spite of what you're saying, the ""alternative therapy"" avenue was closed.  There were no reputable physicians who were willing to put forward that the child would ever recover.

I'm happy to have a real physicist come along and chew me out ;)
                
As physicists are wont to do, assume the ""bomb"" is a perfect sphere and made out of iron.  And that the plane is standing still in the air so that the velocity is straight down in one direction
        
Also assume that our magically spherical ball is 1000lbs (454kg), since the B-52 can carry 1000lb bombs
        
    mass of ""bomb""= m_ball= 454kg
    density_of_iron = d_iron =7870 kg/m^3
    initial_height = h = 12192m
    volume_of_ball = v_ball = m_b / d_i = 454kg / (7870kg/m^3) = .05m^3
    radius_of_ball = r_ball = 0.22854m <--- just trust me on this one

so next we need to figure out its terminal velocity so we can sanity check how fast it will be going when we drop it

first a few variable definitions:

    gravity = g = 9.8m/s^2
    density_of_air = d_air = 1.275 kg/m^3
    coefficient_of_drag_for_sphere= c_d = 0.5
    surface_area_of_ball= a_ball = .7m^2

So to find terminal velocity:

    terminal_velocity = t_v = sqrt((2*m_ball*g)/(C*d_Air*a_ball))
     = sqrt((2 * 454kg * 9.8m/s^2)/(.5 * 1.275kg/m^3 * .7m^2))
     = sqrt(8898.4 / .4462)
     = sqrt(3970.46)
     = 63.01m/s
        
  So we need to know how long it is until our ball reaches that velocity.  

For a dropped object:

    Velocity = gravity*time
    V=gt
    
And if we want to get the time we'll do:

    t=V/g
    t=(63.01m/s)/9.8m/s^2)
    t=6s

So it takes 6s to achieve terminal velocity.  And how far does it drop in that time?

    distance = velocity * time
    d = vt

So:

    d = 63.01m/s * 6s
    d = 378m

Since this is much less than the full height of the drop, I hope you will forgive me if I do some simplication

So, the energy at the top of the drop (right before it falls out) is:

    E=.5 * m_ball * (t_v)^2
    =.5 * 454kg * (63.01m/s)^2
    =.5 * 454kg * (3969m^2/s^2)
    =.5 * (1801926kg m^2/s^2)
    =900963 kg m^2/s^2 = 900963 Joules

Or thereabouts, anyway

I looked it up and a ton of TNT has the potential energy of 4.184*10^9 J (4184000000 J)

So if we solve for y in this equation:

    900963 = 4.184*10^9 J/ton * y
    y=(900963)/(4.184*10^9 J/ton)
    y=.0002 tons
