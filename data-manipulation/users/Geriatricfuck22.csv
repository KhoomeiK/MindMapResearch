EverythingScience,fd7tw4f,t3_ejxzgb,1578210032.0,I’ve had cathartic experiences while using ketamine recreationally and also nightmarish trips as well. The threshold between a good trip and a bad one is insane. I’ve found it exposes you to your deepest self but if you aren’t ready to process what that feels like it can cause terrible anxiety and paranoia. I can see why it helps suicidal patients it really makes you step back from normal cognition/consciousness. I think the derealization/depersonalization aspect of the high gets them out of  the suicidal rumination cycle.
