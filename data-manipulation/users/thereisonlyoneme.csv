Dogtraining,ff552wp,t3_ermzwi,1579580465.0,"Intelligent doesn't necessarily mean trainable. I've heard of dogs who find ways around doing the desired behavior because they are smart. Plus you are likely have the problem where the dog is not receiving enough mental stimulation. That probably explains your current dog's compulsions. It's not that he's a mutt; You're not challenging him. If you can't challenge him, then I wouldn't go for a more intelligent dog. Instead go for a trainable dog. That means a breed that is eager to please and has a well-known motivation. Labs are usually easy because they are loyal and you know they love food and tennis balls for rewards."
relationships,ff524jq,t3_erhaf3,1579578162.0,"Your coworkers sound like nasty people. Maybe they are immature. Maybe their lives are boring. God knows. Don't try to figure them out. You can't change them. Don't try. That just leads to frustration. I think you're going to have to accept your work environment is what it is. The only way I can see it changing is if someone else is hired that for whatever reason they decide to focus their bullying on. If I were you I'd set a goal that defines the length of time that you need to stay at this job. Maybe there is something that you want to learn or some experience you want to gain. Maybe it's a title you want to attain. Maybe it's just staying there a year because that is enough longevity to look good on your resume. After you accomplish that I'd leave at the speed of a bullet out of a gun. Or maybe you decide that environment is so toxic and that it's not worth the stress. In that case you can leave. Such a short stint at a job doesn't look good on a resume so you'll have to explain it in interviews.

If you stay then from now on, do things because **you do them** *not* because you're trying to change those people. For example, why do you share snacks? Is it to bribe those people into liking you? If so then stop. You're trying to change them and that's not going to happen. Or do you share snacks because you feel sharing is right? If so continue! But be happy that you are doing what you know is right. Then your coworkers' reaction becomes irrelevant. When you stop doing things to please other people and start doing things because you know they are right, you are happier because you are looking to yourself for happiness."

aww,ff3xdt2,t1_ff3pznn,1579550931.0,"There aren't really any statistics to back the fearmongering around Pit Bulls. Statistically you are most likely to be bitten by a Dachshund or a Chihuahua. The typical response to that is that they are small so they can't do much damage. I suspect those people have never actually been bitten by one of those dogs. In one of the articles below an attorney who handles dog bite cases says that they can do a lot of damage.

Even if you talk only about large breeds, the numbers people typically trot don't provide the entire picture. I have seen difference statistics. For the sake of discussion we will use the numbers from the Forbes article which are sourced from an anti-Pit Bull website. It says there were 284 Pit Bull fatalities but ""only"" 45 Rottweiler fatalities. What it ignores is the number of those dogs. The Pit Bull Info website gets into the details of that, but let me illustrate the point in a way they don't. According to statistics I found, 22 people are killed by dogs and 2 people are killed by captive tigers every year in the US. From those numbers shouldn't we conclude that tigers are safer pets than dogs? After all 2 is smaller than 22. Of course we don't reach that conclusion. When we look at fatal attacks as a function of population, we see that tigers are 500 times more dangerous, statistically speaking. Granted there are a lot of different statistics out there and Pit Bull Info appears biased pro-Pit Bull, but the point still stands even if the numbers are a little off.

OK, but we really don't have to assume. Every word of this post is dripping with condescension. When you say things like ""dumb"" and ""sucks"" and ""inferior products that use useless buzzwords to sucker people into spending more money"" you really shouldn't be surprised that people reacted. If you don't want to buy natural products then good for you but why shit all over everyone else's choice. All of that is unnecessary, distracting, and totally immaterial to the story. ""My wife doesn't buy the thing I want at the store"" would have been enough. Plus, I'm not judging but you can compare your problem to the others posted in the sub for yourself.

The next thing is you need to accept your wife as she is. When you send her to the store to buy something, she is going to reevaluate the product choices on every trip and buy what she thinks is best for you. It's just what is going to happen. She is going to do this as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow. Bet millions of dollars on it. It's who she is. You're not going to change or control her. You can't rewire her brain or make her wear a shock collar to the store that zaps her if she touches Tom's of Maine. Accept this as fact. 

Now that you have accepted her as she is, what do you do? You work with it. When you are particular about what you want, go to the store yourself.  A lot of stores have pickup options now so you can tell her ""it's ready and waiting for you at the pickup counter. (And by the way thanks for getting this for me)."" Order it online. On the occasions when you're not particular or don't know what to buy, let her do what comes naturally. She'll do the research for you and save you the hassle.

By the way, I'm also stank. Tom's of Maine has a ""for men"" product that has aluminum in it. Not all do so you have to look at the label. It works for me. Mainly I like it because they don't test on animals. Now if you don't want to try it then good for you. If you think I'm dumb and a sucker then that's fine too you judgmental fucker. LOL! But if this is important to your wife then it might mean a lot to her that you give this stuff a try."
