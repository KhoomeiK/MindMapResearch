piercing,ffgvl4g,t3_etjtcz,1579916173.0,Definitely don't move the ring around when you move it. Rings aren't really recommended for fresh piercings because they move around too much which can cause irritation bumps and slow healing. I wouldn't worry too much about the size of your hoop unless your helix swells a ton and then you find that it's too tight. Not sure how quickly piercings swell. Just keep an eye on it. The best thing to have there would be a titanium flat back labret while you heal.
