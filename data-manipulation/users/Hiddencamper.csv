I finally decided to start a hobby. I’m playing warhammer 40k at the game store on Tuesday’s. I feel guilty though. I normally work 50 hour weeks, I leave an hour earlier so I can get home and make dinner and help out so I feel like I’m being fair to my wife for leaving her one night a week 

She doesn’t make me feel guilty, but I feel it’s my responsibility to be home and helping during the week. But at the same time I’ve been just crushed lately. My friends all moved away, I live in the opposite direction from most of my coworkers. And I’ve been getting lonely. When I mentioned to my wife what I was looking at she just said “you need to do this, please do this”. I didn’t realize she was worried about me, trying to just deal with this all on my own. 

I read an article a week or two ago about how men are spending 3-4 times more with our kids than 2 generations ago. We are better with our families but losing the bonding we have with others and it’s not always healthy or what’s best. It’s important to find some time to do those hobbies and social activities, even if it’s just once a week."

personalfinance,ffb15yr,t1_ff9qee4,1579749229.0,"Look at brackets in general. Your taxable is going to be social security for income. If you are married your 12% bracket goes up to around 80k. So you can do 401k withdrawals up to this amount at 12%. Traditional will pretty much always win here. 

If you are single your 12% tax bracket goes to about 40k. Not as good. 

The 22% tax bracket goes up to 171k for married or 85kish if single. For a married couple it probably doesn’t matter. For single, this is where traditional vs Roth becomes a talking point. 

My opinion is to have a mix. My 401k is traditional and my IRA is Roth. I also have capital assets outside of both. Capital gains plays interestingly with all of this. If you are single you pay zero tax on your capital gains up to almost 40k (after accounting for other income). Married is 78k or so. So if you get 30k combined social security, no other income, you can sell for up to 48k in gains with 0 tax on it. Then you can take some of those sales and put it back into your Roth IRA! 

If you are short one year you can use Roth money to cover. Maybe you have an emergency or something. Maybe a big vacation. 

It all depends. But if you don’t have a good mix of money you may not be able to take advantage of it at some point. You might not be hyper optimized, but it gives you flexibility."

nuclear,ff8yf7z,t1_ff8xxxp,1579700064.0,"It’s mainly cost driven. If the economics supported it, the large corporations which have the ability to fund a nuclear plant would find a way to get through the regulations. 

Back in the 2000s when carbon cap and trade was a possibility in the Us, nuclear was seen as a potential goldmine. When that never came to fruition nuclear lost a lot of potential value. This era was believed to be a nuclea renaissance but it didn’t happen. Then in 2008 the energy market crashed and at the same time fracking started getting big. The price of natgas plummeted over the next few years and most new plants going up were natgas. Now, I’m the absence of subsidies, only natgas can compete. Natgas sets the price of power in most of the country. Wind and solar survive because of credits and subsidies. Everything else isn’t economically viable to build, and in many cases it’s barely viable to own. 

Existing nuclear is seen as a large asset to hold as a hedge against some type of future fracking regulation or an energy policy. Their asset value would skyrocket if these things happened. But they barely get by in a lot of areas, especially merchant markets. 

As for building new plants, the US hasn’t built large projects like these in such a long time that we are inefficient at it. The regulatory process needs some work too. It just costs too much money. Which is why the next development in nuclear are small modular reactors (see NuScale). The goal is to reduce the required construction costs as much as possible by factory building as much as you can and not needing large concrete pours and structural steel/etc which costs a lot of time and money."
nuclear,ff8xxkj,t1_ff66c1z,1579699654.0,"A few reasons. 

The main one is a combination of fuel depletion and waste products buildup means you eventually reach a point where you can no longer maintain full power. Power drops for a boiling water reactor around 0.5% per day, and for a pwr closer to 1% per day. 

Other limits:

The fuel builds up more plutonium over time, and causes the fast neutron response to be larger, which in turn puts penalties on your reactivity limits. This can also impact shutdown margin, heat transfer out of the fuel, etc

The older fuel has lifetime and maximum burnup limits in the core to ensure the cladding doesn’t fail."

That picture with a ton of snow doesn't tell us the temperature. Was it -15 degF or less with a high wind chill? Because I've seen fluffly snow like that in +15 degF and that is a 30 degF difference. Also the wind really matters, as the wind increases heat removal from the car.

Or the MPDRWL, a new parameter (minimum pre depressurization reactor water level). It’s designed to ensure you don’t ever uncover the core if you meet the conditions prior to an emergency blowdown. That parameter is only valid below 250 psig generically. What if it was valid under different rules at higher pressures?

nuclear,fep132g,t1_feorapy,1579309777.0,"Power density doesn’t go up. You add more control rods. 

The two things that can affect safety, higher burnup fuels may have higher decay heat, and higher burnup fuels have more plutonium (affects criticality safety, and fast neutron response). These are mitigated through the maintenance of shutdown margin and the core monitoring computer which ensures your reactor limits are acceptable.

Increased decay heat won’t be a concern for the fuel since you will gain more time to fuel damage. However the containment heat analysis and blowdown analysis for relief valves and post pressurization transient response would need to be evaluated in the licensing process before you can load high enrichment and high burnup fuels."
nuclear,fen30em,t1_femxr3r,1579275842.0,"There are two ATFs that GE is testing. The first is a coating on the cladding. With the surface coating intact you gain protection by inhibiting the reaction until a couple thousand degrees higher when it starts to fail. The ironclad fuel uses different cladding entirely that’s iron based and uranium gets to melting temperatures before the iron starts it’s metal water reaction. 

The enrichment piece I’m still learning about. The industry is asking the nrc to extend burnup averages of fuel to 75 gwd/ton. I think the current limit is 62 I believe. So that is substantial. Coupled with that is an increase to 8% allowable enrichment. I know that cladding oxidation is a huge factor in fuel rod internal pressures, so if these ATF fuels minimize oxidation (which they would have to), that will lower peak fuel pressures and allow for higher enrichments.

Not sure about changing the sintering process."
nuclear,femtg8i,t1_fem3u7d,1579269120.0,"The biggest part, is hitting 2200 degF is no longer the end of your reactor core. 

Above 2200 degF the metal water reaction becomes autocatalytic and runs away, and water makes it worse. It’s not unlikely that the core won’t stabilize and quench until it breaks apart and falls into the water in the bottom head /lower plenum, at which point it will cause a huge steam flash/possibly steam explosion and finally cool back down. Even with emergency injection (if you start emergency injection after the core is substantially superheated). 

ATF fuels give you much more time and depending on the type and conditions, may never become auto catalytic. Meaning you can add water at any time and get a direct temperature reduction, versus now where you have an initial thermal spike."
nuclear,femkqhj,t1_fel7occ,1579260445.0,"There is more than that though and big safety benefits. 

The ATFs are for accident conditions. ATF generates very little or no hydrogen until much higher core temperatures during an accident. This is important because during a core uncovery I can expect 100 degF/minute heatup rates until we exceed 2200 degF, where traditional fuels will skyrocket to 400-500 degF per minute until radiative heat transfer starts to kick in (and the cladding fails). The hydrogen reaction is nasty. 

ATFs have very linear heatup rates until you are extremely superheated and the hydrogen reaction starts up. It extends core uncovery times from minutes to an hour or more before you start having significant gross fuel damage and hydrogen generation. 

This is extremely important as that hydrogen reaction is what fucks you. Once it’s started, trying to add water to put the fire out is very hard, because unless you have at least a minimum of 10000 gpm of core spray you won’t have enough injection rate to overcome the H2 reaction and you will generate more heat, causing gross core damage, more heat, rising reactor pressure (making it harder to inject) and challenging containment integrity. With ATFs, you can get the core covered again with 1000 gpm or less because adding water on superheated ATF doesn’t cause more heat. 

This has nothing to do with core thermal limits. The only real limit that impacts power production is PCIOMR or PCMARG. Delta Ps for rod pulls as well. Those are based on the pellet and rod internals, not the cladding material. The other limits (MFLCPR, MAPRAT, MFLPD) are not about plant operation. MFLCPR is about dry out on the fuel. MFLPD is about plastic cladding strain during overpower events. MAPRAT is about 2200 degF post LOCA. Yes these will change, but they really don’t have an impact on normal operation. At Clinton in particular MAPRAT is non limiting. MFLCPR and MFLPD are only limiting in specific ranges and typically only at end of life, or on the stupid 1 year refuel cycle. Or when COLR penalties are applied. 

Some things ATF will also allow the industry to do is potentially reanalyze the ECCS rule to gain margin. The emergency procedure committee has already talked about the possibility of procedure impacts to C1 (alternate level control) for core operation when you don’t have high capacity reflood, or for below TAF operation. There is a lot of emergency operation flexibility here. 

This stuff makes the core safer, improves safety limit and thermal limit margins during accidents, and allows for a better system response from LOCAs and ELAP events. 

I’m not sure where your information comes from.

Edit: just to note, ATF also will allow for higher burnup and enrichment of up to 8%. So there is a financial effect of this as well. But it’s all due to having more margin to accident limits, not normal operating limits, and if anything may make MFLCPR worse by having higher plutonium concentrations in the core."

AskEngineers,fdoo6q2,t1_fdokyd5,1578609172.0,"When you look at 29cfr1910.147 you shouldn’t use control switches for electrical isolation ever. They are not considered energy isolation devices. We only use them for supporting mechanical isolation in some weird circumstances. 

Anyways, A plc and software are not isolation devices. 

Remember that you can still have hardware or software failure that results in the injection of hazardous energy. At least with a mechanical control switch you still have physical disconnection. But in this case you do not. And you don’t know what type of failure modes can occur. Have you explicitly designed and tested your system for those types of physical hazards?

There’s also a number of OSHA regs like 29cfr1910.333(b)(2)(ii)(B) that say interlocks for equipment should not be used as a substitute for LOTO, which is essentially what you are doing, using a software interlock for safety. From a regulation perspective you need a physical disconnect."
AskEngineers,fdojx1p,t1_fdnwn40,1578606643.0,"I would never rely on the hand switch. 

We will disconnect the field interface terminal connector. For example, if I’m doing work on a valve in the field that has 120V control power, in my main control room there is a jack I can disconnect to remove that power. Or I can have the guys lift leads hot if it’s 120V or less. But to rely on a switch is poor practice, unless you can physically remove the actuator from the switch and put a robust barrier on it. I’ve see GE SBMs get removed with the switch locked out and an info tag applied across the switch post (obviously not zone of protection). 

Alternatively, in nuclear power, if they aren’t working on something directly energized (just around it) the workgroup can apply a robust barrier like an insulating material over the energized connection points. We then mark the tagout as exceptional, and the work group has to accept it before signing on to the tagout."
AskEngineers,fdoi2m1,t3_emd6ca,1578605579.0,"I’m in the nuclear industry and I am qualified to write, authorize, and apply tagouts. 

No. Software is not safe for LOTO. 

You need to lift leads or deenergize modules.

Control switches should not be used for zone of protection. This is an exceptional tagout and requires extensive additional controls to ensure minimum required safety and should be avoided (we only use it if the component in question is in a high radiation area which is not accessible to remove energy, and we will apply tags plus at the controls location and declare the tagout exceptional). 

In virtually all cases controls should never be used for protection."

NuclearPower,fdl2dfh,t3_ely3dt,1578515879.0,"If you are shutting down the reactor with control rods, they will cause the neutron flux to drop at least 12 orders of magnitude. With a shutdown reactor you can leave the rods in essentially indefinitely. 

When we have rods in during operation, they do deplete. Most rods are removed during BWR operation, and typically are fully removed in pwrs during normal full power operation. 

We have to keep track of control rod depletion if we run with rods partially or fully inserted during full power ops. They need change outs every several years (6-12). The fully withdrawn ones can more or less stay in the core for decades.

NuclearPower,fcpa6hr,t1_fcp8g4t,1577855854.0,"Correct. But it is a very distinct difference. 

Prompt critical reactions are not controllable and will proceed until physics stops them (typically due to fuel vaporization, or in the case of a bomb, explosion). 

Delayed critical is what makes reactors controllable."
NuclearPower,fcoecks,t3_ei8c93,1577830179.0,"We design nuclear weapons to operate in the prompt critical region. 

Power reactors are delayed critical. In this mode, the reactor is not capable of criticality on prompt neutrons alone. It relies upon the decay of fission products, some of which produce additional neutrons. These additional decays create the neutrons we need and take several seconds to be born, compared to prompt neutrons which can be born in less than the microsecond scale. 

Commercial reactors use physical designs which ensure they are not capable of going into a full core prompt critical state. They are always delayed critical outside of some special postulated accident scenarios, and in those scenarios the core is only physically capable of localized prompt critical (localized fuel damage, not an explosion). 

The physical design is a major factor. The reliance on delayed neutrons. Also the lower enrichment fuel (5% for power reactors compared to over 95% for weapons), and finally pre-analyzed safe operating states combined with the reactor protection system which automatically detects power excisions or situations which can cause them and scrams the reactor. These all keep power reactors in a controlled and slow burn state."
