TrueChristian,fep3ihb,t3_eq9mkn,1579311315.0,"If my understanding of nihilism and your relationship with it is correct, you believe that there is no meaning or value in anything and there’s no such thing as good or bad. 

Factually, you are correct on your 2nd point. We will all be dead eventually, so will our families, friends, values, everything that mattered to us will be gone. But you leap off of that to say if we will all be dead eventually, then nothing we do now has any meaning. And that’s where you are wrong. 

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is dead, and I still to this day enjoy reading Sherlock Holmes stories. His stories will be read forever. His stories have been turned into movies and a beloved TV show. But I believe you think Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s life was also meaningless because he’s dead, and eventually the sun will burn up and life as we know it will be over. Will the planets or stars know who Doyle was? Nope. So those countless hours of millions of people being entertained amounts to nothing? And that right there highlights the illogical cynicism of nihilism. As humans, the only thing we have that’s worth anything is our lives. We get one chance to make mistakes, learn lessons, get knocked down, walk away, laugh till it hurts, cry till you’re out of tears. And it is all so incredibly valuable I don’t understand how anyone can be blind to that."

I got to say, Saturday is going to be a fun day, no matter what happens. I know other fans on both sides get their panties in a wad when their opponents get cocky, but to me this is half the fun! I mean, sports are competitive, so if you don’t have a competitive fire and want to cut your enemies throat, why are you watching and why do you care at all? I **love** playoff football. Good luck Ravens, you guys have a hell of a team! 

I sincerely hope Lamar throws 3 INT’s,
