I can see how talking about these scary issues in a healthy way, like we are right now, can help treat the root of some deep-seated anxiety and depression conditions.

I do think that maybe ""nothing matters"" is an absurd claim, but it can hold truth depending what lens you look with.

I'm all for humans creating their own meaning in any conceivable way (as long as it doesn't hurt others unreasonably). Our consciousness gives us the ability to think freely to some degree, so in a way, crafting our own meaning and purpose, like easing the pain of others and educating children, is the ultimate fuck you to existing in a meaningless universe.

Hope that rambling made sense. I wrote my original post way past my bedtime and verbal diarrhea'd more than anything, so I can understand why you would want to protect OP from the dangers of misunderstood nihilism. :)"
getdisciplined,fdrm4t5,t1_fdr25ms,1578686408.0,"I think that not accepting that, overall, this is all meaningless and our efforts are silly in the grand scheme of the universe can give people a lot of anxiety. At least, it did for me. It's all subjective. I used to be a lot more egotistical and selfish until I started studying philosophy (casually) and faced these questions I'd been running from.

At first, nihilism seemed like an easy answer to write off attaining happiness. How can someone be happy in a meaningless universe? It actually made me very sad for a bit. Starting to question nihilism more in-depth led me to [optimistic nihilism](http://www.openculture.com/2017/10/the-philosophy-of-optimistic-nihilism-or-how-to-find-purpose-in-a-meaningless-universe.html), and that gave me the power and confidence to have an honest conversation with myself about what I truly want to try and get done in my short time here."
getdisciplined,fdq2yub,t1_fdpmbm5,1578652310.0,"OP, You've got to realize that life is suffering, as almost all messages of religion boil down to. I'm not selling you on religion. Religions tend to get one thing right, and that's the consensus of inherent suffering in life. There's no way around it. We die, everyone we love dies, it hurts, and it's over quicker than we can consider why. It doesn't make sense, but that's totally okay. Nothing in the universe matters, but humans have the ability to give life meaning, and thus, live a life according to their own means. In fact, the [absurdity of this can and should inspire you to live a truly free life.](https://youtu.be/w7EBDF_Ixjg)

Part two. Suffering makes you grow like a motherfucker. Please relish in this. It's evolution. Things that are difficult, like working out, push you to grow in a variety of aspects. Give your suffering meaning by understanding this challenge you are facing is going to be the thing that pushes you forward to grow as a person. When you find the strength to push through this challenge, you'll find a feeling of warmth, comfort, and satisfaction in your belly like no other.

Don't be scared of suffering - embrace it.
