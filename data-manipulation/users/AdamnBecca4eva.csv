relationship_advice,ffrashh,t1_ffra396,1580154173.0,"Well I would think it is less of an ultimatum and more of you trying to be the most open you. 
I mean it’s kinda like you are setting the house on fire , you gotta tell her about it. So if she wants out she can run, and maybe she will want to rebuild with you instead but if she has no choice ... not fair you know?
Now how you come across... you can only try your best to speak the truth with love and kindness. Emotional manipulation is when you are already deciding an outcome for her. You just need to be open to accepting her response without pushing. She may very well have a knee jerk response that is angry, hurt, and leaves. 
But you can’t know until you give her the opportunity to be in charge of her own future, and she may surprise you.
I’m a woman that once “set my marriage on fire” and I let him know. He forgave me, we worked it out. If I hadn’t been completely honest I would definitely have lost him."

unpopularopinion,ffpskwb,t3_euhoke,1580104171.0,"Divorce rates are high because people settle. They marry before they have lived together at least 5 years. They marry before they go through huge life moments together. I don’t think the “spark” ever has to go away. You keep that bitch lit, by growing together, taking care of your relationship.
There is no magic bubble that keeps you together, you build it, after you have been in the trenches together, see how you deal with life and tragedy’s . 
I hear a lot about people saying sex had dried up blah blah, well that should be in your 40s or farther when health problems come into play. 
Marriage isn’t all butterflies but it is spending everyday with your best friend who you’d rather hang out with than anyone else. And i would never have settled for less."
AskReddit,ffpqo1y,t3_euht3h,1580102324.0,"Yeah too much, I used to be quite the doormat, I tried to help everyone and Do too much for people. Always had stray friends on the couch and leant money. I care deeply for everyone and the more I talk to them the more I want to be there for them. 
My hubby has helped me with it a lot , I’ve helped him have more empathy and he has helped me to focus it all on family and close friends.
I don’t know how it can be explained except that you often care for others more than yourself and can feel their needs, their pain, their joy. Not in a way where you throw a fit because of their bad mood, but in a way your heart just opens to them and you feel the humanity that’s in everyone. We are all just stitched up messes aren’t we?"

Let me tell ya I didn’t look good on paper. I’ve always read a lot though and communication and writing have always been my strongest attributes.
I always took care of myself never really let guys buy me things . The people that intimidated me were usually the more ambitious career minded people. I admired them, just not my vein of life.
I had become pretty disenchanted at that point though, just didn’t see myself letting anyone else into my weird little life. 
I think attraction is huge, not particularly the superficial but face it, you want to look at this person and want to touch them, be close to them, have sex with them. If you find yourself mismatched just keep stretching your mind, your body, be the best you until you find the one you want then fight like hell to make it work!"
