Of course we got to base camp, spent our first night there in their big canvas tents, and it proceeded to downpour more than it had in the last 7 years (7years prior was coincidentally about the same time my troop had last sent a group out there and they also got rained on pretty bad)

Those tents are usually pretty waterproof, they're the same ones used at summer camps across the country, but I guess they got a little lazy about their waterproofing because half of us got soaked that night.

Next morning everything that was practically a desert the day before was green and lush. A couple days later everything was dead again."

BoyScouts,ffhjs85,t3_etej0b,1579938476.0,"At the end of the day, you need to do what makes you happy. If you're truly miserable in scouting and don't feel that you're getting anything out of it, then you're certainly within your rights to want out.

First though, you might want to consider some alternatives. Different troops run their programs differently, it might be worthwhile to look into moving to another troop in your area. Meetings have different flows, and some troops do different activities, for example, you mentioned hating backpacking, but the troop I came up through rarely did backpacking (when I went to Philmont at 17, I think it was the first experience with it for most of our crew) we tended to focus more on boating. Maybe you'd rather finish earning your eagle as a venturer or sea scout (I believe that's still allowed, or if not you can work on their equivalent awards)

There's also the matter of the time you've already sunken into the scouting program. A lot of people who drop out later come to regret not earning eagle. Since you're a life scout, you're already most of the way there, and eagle looks really good on resumes and college applications (also you don't think it will, but it comes up in random conversation often enough that it's served me well as a bit of an ice breaker and I've made friends just from discovering we're both eagles)

You can also try to address some of your concerns with the other scouts and leaders in your troop. A good scouting program should be run with a lot of input from the scouts themselves. If what they're doing isn't working for you, speak up about it.

Again, at the end of the day you gotta figure out what's right for you, and none of us can tell you what that means, it's something you have to figure out for yourself."

todayilearned,ff8g9ld,t1_ff86esc,1579677146.0,"I'm a hunter myself, and the attitude of a lot of big game trophy hunters really bothers me. That said, regulated hunting can a valuable tool for conservation, even for endangered animals. Just because an animal is endangered overall doesn't mean they don't have healthy or even thriving populations in some areas, sometimes in those areas you end up with more of a population than the environment can actually support properly, relocating animals may not be feasible for any number of reasons and the population needs to be thinned. They can pay a game warden to do it, or you can let a rich asshole with a dumptruck of money pay them for a permit, so why not do that and use the money to fund further conservation projects? (Hunters, in general, whether or not they actually care about conservation themselves, are *huge* donors to conservation just by buying their licenses, poachers can get fucked with a rake)

There's other reasons as well besides general population control, permits might be issued to take specific individuals that are sick or injured, or are posing a danger, aggressive older males preventing younger males from mating, etc. 

A lot of, maybe even most, big game and trophy hunters are doing it for macho cool guy points, but often they're essentially doing conservation work that would need to be done anyway and pumping money into conservation programs that can really use the money.

There's obviously some concern about if these hunting programs are being properly managed, and I'm sure in some cases they're not, they're as vulnerable to corruption as any bureaucratic system. And rich assholes offering hundreds or thousands of dollars to often under-funded agencies can be hard to pass up, even if it's not totally in the best interest of the animals."

It's bullshit that you can make all kinds of dumb personal, financial and medical decisions for yourself, buy guns, live on your own, etc. but for some reason can't be trusted with alcohol or tobacco. Either ban it entirely or let adults make adult decisions. Minimum age requirements for elected offices are also asinine.

A decent compromise I think would be everyone who's 18 before the law goes into effect can keep buying tobacco products, but everyone younger than that can never buy them.

AskReddit,femrkxg,t3_eptxb3,1579267584.0,"My mom's cousin was an all-around lovely woman, and thankfully this isn't about her but her husband.

I always kind of thought he was kind of a fat, lazy, white trash idiot, but never really had any major issues with him. Leading up to her death though, I started finding out how much of a piece of shit he was. She'd gotten sick, and all through the process he wasn't the least bit helpful with anything and only cared how it was affecting him. 

On the day she died, we'd made arrangements to put their dogs and cats into shelters or give them to family friends. My mom was over there helping to care for her cousin and I was on my way over to pick up the animals. I'm only a couple blocks away and my mom calls me frantically telling me not to come over. I pull up in front of the house and meet her outside. The asshole came downstairs with a shotgun talking about how he was going to end it all. I tell her to call the cops. We get the situation calmed down somewhat, the cops take his guns, we wrap up everything we need to do, I leave, and my mom's cousin passes a couple hours later. 

If only that were the end of it.

Maybe a couple months later, my mom happens to be driving by that neighborhood and sees a bunch of cop cars and an ambulance go down that street and stopping at the house. She goes and talks to the neighbors and police to see what's going on. He's dead, and the neighbors saw a woman running down the street carrying a bag. They couldn't immediately rule out foul play, but eventually it was pieced together that he'd moved some woman in (we're pretty sure a prostitute) and he'd just dropped dead from being on uneasy piece of shit. She grabbed his computer and a couple other small valuable things, and got the hell out of dodge. We don't blame her, good on her for getting some value out of him. 

Unfortunately, my mom was the executor of their wills, so she's saddled with getting everything squared away, and as we're doing that, I really started to find out what a piece of shit he was.

So in addition to the shotgun thing, and moving a hooker in shortly after this wife died, he never had any kind of funeral service for her, just kept her ashes on the kitchen table. He could never hold down a job, so she was basically the sole breadwinner. Nevertheless the asshole was always buying ridiculous and impractical cars- giant trucks and SUVs, classic muscle cars, limited edition sports cars, etc. Shortly after she died, he had bought a relatively new Camaro.

So predictably there was a mountain of debt to sort through, including a hefty mortgage on the house (worth noting,s- they inherited the house about 20 years previously, completely paid off from my great aunt, who had hoped that it would one day be left to my sister and/or meme, that didn't happen thanks to the debt)

As we're going through the house, it got really depressing how much stupid shit this asshole had for himself, but how little my mom's cousin had. He got basically whatever he wanted, never cooked, cleaned, or did any housework, but had closets full of clothes and shoes, expensive fishing and hunting gear, dumb shit for his ridiculous cars, etc. and again, was never able to hold down a job for more than a few months, while she worked, did all of the chores, and had only a very modest wardrobe and some small knickknacks around the house to show for it and drove some base model Kia.

And of course I got to hear all of the stories of how he was kind of a mentally/emotionally abusive asshole that were never really discussed while they were alive. 

We were able to get together a funeral for her. None of his (estranged) children wanted anything to do with the situation, so for him we just let the counter do whatever they do with unclaimed remains."

The truth of the matter is most people don't really need to know much about computers. There's some power-users who need or want to tinker with some things that require more in-depth knowledge, and mostly they'll figure it out as needed, but a lot of people only ever need to use a web browser, word processor, and maybe a spreadsheet program.

Knowing how to use and navigate apps (on a phone/tablet or on a computer) is as in-depth as most users really need to go, and honestly locking them out of any more advanced features as much as possible is probably for the best for both their own good and for the sanity of the actual ""computer people"" in their lives.

A lot of the old keyboard and mouse skills are kind of on the way out with the rise of touchscreens. Typing used to be a somewhat specialized skill, and it may well go that way again. Not that basic typing and mouse skills shouldn't still be taught, but de-emphasizing them may not be the worst thing in many cases. 

Once upon a time computers were complicted and only used by people who could really understand them, as they got simpler, more people could use them until they reached a sort of critical mass around the 90s-early 2000s where they became simple enough that it was expected that everyone should be able to learn the skills to use them.

After a while the UPS/FedEx small package shipping guy got fired. As the most technologically literate guy in the warehouse, and one of only about 3 native English speakers, I got moved into that position and got a small pay bump. At a larger company, my job probably would have been done by a robot arm and some cameras. Weigh and measure boxes, slap a shipping label on them, throw them on a skid. Whatever, can't complain, I'm getting an *almost* decent paycheck and doing less work.

Then the warehouse supervisor (or maybe warehouse manager? the company organization was a little baffling) got sick and retired. He mostly handled things like ordering supplies, scheduling freight pickups, and to some extent, schmoozing with freight company representatives. Again, I get to fill those duties, in addition to my small package duties. I get another small pay bump, definitely not supervisor/manager pay, and find myself in an odd position where I'm still just a lowly hourly peon who is simultaneously in charge of negotiating with these freight companies while having absolutely no authority to do so. I streamlined the whole shipping system so it's all ran from one computer instead of spread across about 5 different desks, spend half my day on the phone chasing down the best rate to send these heavy and bulky but really low value items clear across the country in a timeframe that keeps with our customers ridiculous timetables.

Ever notice how damn near every 50+ year old turns to someone in their teens or 20s when they can't figure out something on their computer or phone and that kid has it fixed in like 2 minutes?

Kids grow up with new technology and it becomes 2nd nature to them. My 80-some year old grandmother can barely work a TV, she didn't get one until she was an adult and never really bothered to learn how to use it properly. My parents grew up with TV and can use it well, but have problems with computer stuff and smartphones, but it's second nature to my sister and I. Whatever comes next will probably throw me for a loop, but my nieces and nephews will be wizards with it. 

There's plenty of reasons to limit and monitor how your kids use technology, but denying it to them is just setting them up to fail and to keep technological progress stagnant. If they don't learn the current technology while they're young, how are they supposed to come up with the next big thing? 

I learned a lot of things as a child and teen- technological literacy, basic life skills, first aid, tool use, etc. and as such I've had a foundation to build on as an adult.

Spanish-speakers in our area are pretty common, but still definitely a minority.

However, when you call 911, we sometimes need to get some very specific information and, especially when we're dealing with a medical call, need you to follow some very specific instructions. Trying to communicate that with someone whose English isn't great is always an adventure.

We have a translation service available for just about every language you can possibly think of,  but having everything go through that 3rd party translator slows things down and introduces more chances for something to be misheard, left out, or lost in translation (I've personally caught translators mishearing or poorly-translating things from Spanish and I can barely manage to order a burrito with the toppings I want. And nothing is more frustrating than the caller rattling off about 3 paragraphs only to have the translator give me a 4-word translation.)

Futurology,fdjdpkc,t1_fdj47w9,1578466550.0,"Imagine a building. There's a frame made from timbers or steel girders that provides structure and holds everything together. It's more-or-less the the shape of a house, but isn't really a complete house on it's own. 

Then there's all of the siding, insulation, plumbing, electricity, gas lines, appliances, shingles, drywall, etc. that all perform various functions. All very important, but again without a frame to hold it together, you just have a pile of building materials that dont really work as a house on their own. 

The extracellular matrix is the frame. It doesn't really do anything by itself except provide structure. There's no cells, just stuff like collagen holding all the cells together. All of the other building materials are the cells- muscle cells, nerve cells, stomach cells, heart cells, liver cells, brain cells, etc. Together they can make a whole organ/house, but individually all of the components are pretty useless.

The bio-ink, as I understand it, is basically 3d printing that frame so they can grow muscles and such into an an actual piece of meat or an organ.

There's also processes being researched of taking an organ from a donor, stripping all of the cells out leaving just the matrix so they can grow a new organ around it from the recipient's own cells. That's basically equivalent of taking a house and stripping it down to bare timbers, then replacing everything else.

That's about the extent of my knowledge on the subject. If anyone can correct anything I said that was wrong, please do.

EDIT: this is also why when you cook meat low & slow it falls apart. You're basically melting out all of the collagen and connective tissue so there's nothing holding it together. It's like if your house got termites that ate all of the timbers so the whole thing collapsed. It's also why tougher cuts of meat are often so tasty- all of that connective tissue holding it together can be very delicious, but not necessarily easy to chew. I personally think a good chuck steak will beat a filet 99/100 times for flavor, but it's not going to be nearly as tender. It's also one of the big hold-ups for lab grown meat, without that connective tissue the taste and texture would be off, otherwise it would be comparatively easy to just grow a bunch of muscle cells and call it a day."

Knots are great because they don't usually require additional hardware and are fairly easy to undo. For something like this that's likely going to be semi-permanent though, they're not always the best choice, knots inherently create weak points in the rope, and for something like this is rather do it right once and not have to redo it again in a year or two.

Also, FWIW, I think splices or rope clamps are a cleaner and more professional-looking solution. You can come up with some attractive-looking braids and such if you do go the paracord route, but I think for an application like this, they're not necessarily the best solution and would look kind of jury-rigged."

If they're ODing, with just a couple squirts up their nose, they can snap back to life in front of your eyes, if they're not ODing, nothing happens, you're just out the cost of the Narcan and have to continue with CPR.

Depending on the circumstances, you may not know for certain that they are ODing, they'll be unconscious or barely consciousness, and their breathing will be slow, labored, agonal (agonal breathing often sounds kind of like snoring,) or they may not be breathing at all.

Secondly- what are you going to be hanging it from and what do the attachment points on the bag itself look like? I'm assuming there's likely d-rings or webbing loops on the bag itself and it will be hung from some sort of hook or clip.

My gut says your best bet would be to have 4 equal lengths of somewhat heavier stranded rope with an eye splice at either end. Have a carabineer/spring link/quick link at one end of each length to easily attach to the bag, and the other ends all attached to single common ring/link (I'd probably recommend using some rope thimbles as well) You can either hang it from that ring or have a 5th length going up to the hook it's being hung from (again going to recommend rope thimbles, eye splices, and maybe some kind of ring or quick link.)

The friend asked something about asking me to prom and that she liked me, so I chimed in (in English because I understand more french than I can speak) that I'd love to go to prom with her.

I shot *near* him. Close enough to spook him a bit, far enough away to not risk hitting him.

todayilearned,fcvqgll,t1_fcvmyru,1578007790.0,"Probably somewhat less so in '06, but it's actually not all that uncommon for Amish people to have cell phones these days. It varries a lot from community to community, but there are generally a lot of exemptions made, they're not completely opposed to technology, only when they feel like it interferes with their family/community life and traditions. Many of them have phones and computers for their businesses, some of them carry 911 only cell phones for emergencies, a lot of them have phone lines running to their homes, usually the phone is located outside of their main house in a shed/barn or little phone booth, and sometimes shared with their neighbors. A lot of them have trucks, tractors, and other farm equipment, especially the elderly or infirm who have a hard time doing things the traditional way, though there's usually a lot of restrictions on their use.

EDIT: because people keep pointing it out, I'm aware of the the distinction between Amish and Mennonite. Mennonites have *a lot* less restrictions on them. Some Amish communities are more progressive than others, this isn't the rule across the board for them, each community decides individually where they want to draw the line."

alaska,fctp6a6,t3_e6b1nb,1577952453.0,"I'm not an Alaskan, I found my way to this thread from someone linking it elsewhere on Reddit. I am a pretty avid outdoorsman however.

What, exactly, are you expecting to do there? What exactly does ""live off the land"" mean to you? Are you planning to move to AK, buy a house somewhere a bit off the beaten path, do a lot of fishing, and maybe raise some chickens and plant a vegetable garden? If that's your plan, then whatever I suppose, go for it. Buy some good winter gear, get yourself a decent toolkit for home maintenance, and have a ball. Expect to have to find a job at some point to fill in the gaps when the salmon aren't running or your heater takes a shit on you.

Or are you looking to do some Into The Wild style adventure? Go off into the woods alone, build a cabin, live completely off-grid, eat, wear, and use only what you carried in with you and what nature provides?

Because if that's your plan, there's a lot of skills and knowledge you're going to need. Living outdoors is rough. You're not going to build any substantial shelter in a day, especially by yourself. That means you need somewhere to stay while you're constructing it. In warmer months, you could probably get away with a basic tent or lean-too (if you haven't already practiced building Bushcraft shelters, you should definitely bone up on that before you go. It can be miserable even in a milder climate) but during winter, you're going to *really* need to build yourself somewhere warm and dry in a hurry. If you've never done any winter camping, I recommend researching that heavily right now, getting your gear, and trying it out before you head anywhere near Alaska. Since you're on the east coast, try somewhere from upstate Pennsylvania or further north first and see what it's like to spend even a weekend out of doors in the winter and remember that AK can be much colder and gets less daylight to work during.you can probably get away with some *good quality* camping gear for a few nights, but trust me, you'll get sick of it really quick. I *love* winter camping, but I wouldn't want to live like that for more than a few days.

What's your construction experience like? Building a house isn't exactly complicated, I think most people can probably handle it with some research, especially if they're not installing electricity, plumbing, or HVAC, but it's definitely an order of magnitude harder than making a birdhouse in middle school woodshop. Log building is pretty a specialized skill, and to do it well enough to survive an Alaskan winter is going to require tools and experience that you can't just pick up on the fly.

You're going to want to adjust your mentality on fishing. Don't think so much rod and reel, think fish traps, nets, and spears. If this is going to be a primary food source, your survival is dependent on having enough fish to fill your stomach and having enough to smoke/salt/etc.so that it lasts for the times you're too busy to fish (like when you're building a house for example,) you're sick or injured, the water is too frozen, or the fish just aren't there. Plan on alternate food sources too. Do you hunt? You should probably pick that up. How are your gardening skills? Do you know which local plants are safe to eat?

There's some things you're probably going to want that can't be found in the woods. Wood-burning stove to keep your cabin warm? Gotta buy that *and then* you gotta get it out to the woods somehow. 

Have you ever tanned leather? Made jerky? Canned your own fruits and vegetables? Made soap from homemade lye water and animal fat? Started a fire with flint & steel or a bow drill? (Or are you planning on bringing a lifetime supply of matches and bic lighters with you?)
