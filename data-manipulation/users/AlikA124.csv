FridgeDetective,feiynsh,t1_feix8gl,1579150921.0,Oh you got both? Always figured it was Tapatio Team vs Cholula Crew
FridgeDetective,feil096,t1_feiia0k,1579140984.0,"For me, calling someone Hispanic for having Cholula in their fridge is equivalent to calling someone Asian for having Sriracha in their fridge. In So Cal everyone has either Cholula, Tapatio, or Valentina in their fridge and Sriracha regardless of race, color, or creed. It’s commonplace like ketchup and mustard so I can’t really draw anything from that

Edit: changed Valencia to Valentina... Valencia is a type of orange"
specializedtools,fei8xxt,t3_ep7w57,1579132927.0,I would love to use that to prank people
FridgeDetective,feh3047,t1_feguuh3,1579108082.0,I can kinda see where you get the other information but besides the Goya what in here says Hispanic? I’m pretty impressed

Feminism,fe0is77,t3_en73f5,1578814050.0,"Wow, I always thought this was just a joke. Didn’t realize it was a common practice. I would figure doctors would have some kind of moral oath or something to keep them from doing this without consent... or even with consent you would think any doctor who isn’t like, a plastic surgeon or something would just say no to doing it"

PublicFreakout,fdj6oct,t1_fdijoc7,1578459958.0,I figure at 93 you gotta wake up thinking every day is gonna be your last. So what’s the worst that can happen if you shoot someone for not fixing your apartment. At a certain age you really got nothin to lose
aesoprock,fdemr62,t1_fddz1rw,1578342301.0,Yeah I was gonna say El said the same thing but I couldnt  find the article
aesoprock,fddszx2,t1_fddhabp,1578323211.0,I always thought all those accusations were for Vast Aire. Dude was known for stealing and trying to make a dollar off of Camu Tao’s death. Which was something Cage and El have both brought up. As much as I’ve searched besides fan speculation I can’t find anything solid that states what happened between these two

todayilearned,fd5ztbw,t1_fd5umqi,1578183581.0,Here in Houston it was 2.16 when I moved here a year ago I saw it for as low as 1.72. Coming from San Diego I have literally never paid that little for gas. When I started driving in 2004 gas was around 1.90

todayilearned,fd4lm8q,t1_fd42a7b,1578168697.0,"I feel like they prob get this a lot and prob encourage it. For one that is not the size of a grand winner check, that’s one of those “meh, lets make them feel nice” big checks. Not to mention advertising people winning anything from a lottery ticket prob just increase interest and sales"
intermittentfasting,fczzgi7,t1_fcznv86,1578111293.0,"Yeah, I’ve noticed it’s become increasingly more common to do after before. It’s weird, this one is not that big of a deal I can clearly see a difference but there are some posts when it takes a good long look to figure out which is which"
