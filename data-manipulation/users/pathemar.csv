movies,fdw4mdt,t1_fdsdldk,1578754992.0,"I completely agree with the visual representations of elevation. The Parks, extremely affluent were located in the hills faaar above all the riff raff, then the Kims, barely high enough above the ground to even get a phone signal in their home, and finally the original 'parasites' in the Parks' basement. I expected some depiction of a middle class family in the film, but I'm beginning to think that the previous housekeeper and her husband *were* the depiction of modern day middle class in Korea.

I was also really conflicted about which characters to sympathize with. Sure, the Kims manipulated the Park family and lied and forged their way into (what they think) are decent jobs, but the Park family paid them in peanuts. In the scene where she stuffs money into an envelope for the first tutoring session she removes like 75% of what she was originally going to pay him. They obviously could afford it, so why the stinginess? Four full grown adults working around the clock and they couldn't even combine their money to find a better apartment. Which parasitic activity is more agregeous? Preying on the cheap labor of poor people, or... recommending your family members for a job they were obviously skilled enough to handle?"
