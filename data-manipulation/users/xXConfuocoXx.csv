Edit 2: If the patient is choking on food or something its generally taught that once they go unresponsive to just begin CPR as the chest compressions can help to dislodge whatever it is they are choking on

Edit 3: Guidelines also vary somewhat for lay persons. I’ve seen some guidelines say to just start CPR when a patient goes unresponsive... personally I disagree compressions on a beating heart can cause damage to the vessels but the logic behind just doing it is that its better to do it and not need it than to need it and not do it. 

I personally argue for better rescue education all around, i think CPR and BLS should be taught in gradeschool and tested yearly throughout adulthood
