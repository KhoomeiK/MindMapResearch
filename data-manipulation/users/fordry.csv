Truckers,ffe5dvv,t3_et3xxt,1579837142.0,This is why you see trucks trying to maintain a speed and allow gaps to form in front of them in traffic. Also why some truckers get all pissed off when people merge into that space.

But if you can find something good as an owner operator then you could exceed the total value of your job. I don't know anything about smaller rigs than semi's. Larger semi sleepers will certainly be more comfortable than any sleeper setup in the smaller rigs.

Make a plan. Get some contacts, some ideas for stuff you'd want to pursue before starting up. Be honest about your situation. Analyze if you want to run under another entity's authority or your own. If you're really looking to get away from a company controlling what you do then running as your own carrier might be what you'd want to pursue, just have to figure everything out. I just went through the process of starting up and there is a lot to it. Probably want to work with an entity that can help you like ooida, dat, or tbs. Also, go in and talk to your local DMV about everything they know and deal with. They'll help you navigate a lot of it too.

And as a new startup, probably just progressive insurance will be your option. Call them up and get a quote now, they'll do it, just pick a truck around what you think you'll get and whatever type of cargo. It's gonna be big. Might take your breath away a little."

Portland,ff5iz7y,t1_fepl7qj,1579595069.0,"Frankly, the bridge itself, at least for northbound, really isn't the problem. If you eliminated the northbound onramp from Jantzen Beach, at least during peak traffic, and then somehow found a way to improve the oncoming traffic from Marine Drive and Delta Park that would be the main things to fix. The bridge itself is still underutilized even in the heaviest of traffic. Seriously, once you're to the 2nd half of the bridge everyone is speeding up and the whole thing instantly thins out. Its just all the onramps before the bridge that kills it. And unless they add more lanes, a new bridge is gonna do diddly squat to fix the situation."

Definitely check out the historic Columbia Gorge highway. This will include Multnomah Falls. If it happens to be warm and if it's open (check ahead) Oneonta Gorge is a fun place. Be prepared to get wet and wear something better than flip flops if you go there.

If it's clear in Portland can check out Council Crest. Great views.

Everett is where Boeing builds all their large planes. It's an absolutely enormous building, largest in the world by volume last I knew. They have a museum/tour. Worth checking it out along with the museum of flight if that sort of thing interests you. Also the Evergreen Aviation museum is really cool, home of the Spruce Goose. Definitely don't miss any of those If you're at all interested.

Chittendon locks in Ballard are kind of interesting. Fun to watch the process of moving boats through and you get to be right up close. Pretty much any time there will be plenty of action there.

If you like steam engines the ORHF museum in Portland is also a can't miss. 

Oregon coast is great, I'd take 101 on down most of it and I'd backtrack from Portland to start at Astoria and Ft Stevens. The dunes down south are fun. 

Come back inland for Crater lake and Oregon Caves is really interesting as well. I'm tempted to say go from there to Tahoe and then swing back to the Bay area if you want. Not really all that much of interest in Northern California.

There's a military museum on the west side of I5 across from JBLM and it seems like they're adding more and more all the time. I haven't been there but I want to sometime. They have a bunch of tanks and things sitting outside. If you're interested it might be a cool pitstop just off the freeway.

I'm not saying I know of anything in this case but it's extremely common for charity work to cause as much or more harm as it helps.

Mariners,fes8y1q,t1_feoah26,1579362677.0,"The Astros won the world series in 2017 and have been really good both a little before and ever since. The past couple of years there have been quiet rumblings that they were cheating somehow by stealing the signs opposing teams used to communicate such as the catcher's signs to the pitcher for selecting the type of pitch. 

It hadn't really made waves much publicly, though, until one of the pitchers that was on the team when they won the world series gave details. That sent everyone into a frenzy and a internet sleuth going by jomboy started finding and posting lots of videos of the cheating where they were using a live video feed of the catcher's signs to someone just down the stairs from the dugout who would bang a trash can to indicate what pitch was coming. The batter could hear it. The tv broadcast was also picking it up, so it created quite a sensation. 

This week baseball announced penalties of 1 year suspensions for the Astros Manager(coach) and their GM, loss of draft picks for the organization, as well as a 5 million dollar fine for the organization. Later the same day the owner announced they were letting both suspended individuals go. Another manager, Alex Cora, now with the Boston Red Sox was with the Astros and was apparently involved and has also been let go.

Late this week a bunch more has come out as more people are digging into this story. Players have been saying more publicly about what they knew. It's an ongoing saga at this point. Lots of drama."

technology,fec9yo4,t1_febjoci,1578969299.0,"Well, we don't know exactly how much capacity this system will have. There are going to be a bunch of satellites and any particular user will probably be connected to several at once.  But there's definitely potential for needing to limit usage in some way to maintain service levels for all.

As for resilience to weather, because these are so much closer than the other satellites, tv satellites are out where the Hughes ones are as well, these shouldn't drop out as much.

This system can be a viable alternative but it is not going to compete with wire based services for speed, capacity, or reliability. It will become the best option immediately for people who currently are only served by wireless options, either cell or satellite."

I think it would be tougher just randomly trying to find loads on the load boards just starting out. I'm kinda breaking in easy with this gig. My weekly gross if I have a decent week is around 4k. And it's mostly on me about having a decent week. 

So one week pays my insurance and truck payment for the month. Then the next week covers fuel basically, then the next 2 mostly I get to keep, some other expenses of course, maintenance being the biggest one to plan for obviously.

I also know that I have a higher paying gig available to me in the summer from some work I did for another company while with my first company.

AskReddit,fcnr0sx,t3_ei6oe1,1577816807.0,"I'll share one. I used to work as an airline fueler. Fueled all the big airlines' planes at a decent sized airport. Was fueling a Northwest Airlines 757 one day and on those the fuel hookups are out under the wing so I'm up in a lift. 

As I'm standing there I see the baggage handler going to reposition the baggage cart to start loading the plane. For unloading the conveyor on the cart is placed just under the lip of the cargo door so bags can be slid out the door right onto the conveyor. For loading, it would be repositioned so the conveyor is up into the cargo hold so bags roll off the end into the hold so the person inside just has to grab and stow it. Pretty basic. 

Well anyway, all vehicles that are parked near a plane, the first thing you do is put wheel chocks in place to prevent it from moving if something occurs with brakes or whatever and this baggage cart had it's wheel chocks placed, as usual. So the baggage handler sits down in the driver seat and goes to move the cart, without picking up the chocks. How this first part went I'm not real sure because, again, I'm fueling the plane, up high probably 50 feet away, and nothing happening yet is looking unusual so I'm not paying much attention, till now. Next thing I know, this baggage handler has managed to run the conveyor up into the cargo hold to far, sliding the bottom of the conveyor on the lip of the cargo hold opening. He's gone so far that the front wheels of the cart have lifted off the ground (also where the driver seat is) because the conveyor on the plane's door lip has lifted the whole front end of the cart.

At this point, I'm probably doing the eye blinking, blank, shocked, stare. This is a highly paid(Northwest baggage handlers were the highest paid at the airport, started at $21/hr in the mid 00's), presumably experienced since they only hired experienced people, baggage handler making an insane mistake. And you'd presume that at this point, you've just connected your little vehicle to the plane, you'd stop and figure out what to do. Well, that's what I'd have done, that's hopefully what most would do, that's not what this baggage handler did.

He throws the cart in reverse, backs it up, conveyor sliding out of the plane, wheels bouncing over those chocks. So now he's backed it off the plane. Again, you'd probably stop, analyze how you've just screwed up, realize that maybe you gave it too much gas trying to get over the wheel chocks and that's how you wound up slamming the conveyor into the cargo door opening and sending your cart up into the air, and you along with it. At least, that's what I would have done, and probably you as well, heh.

But no, this story of this baggage handler, this baggage cart, this plane, and those wheel chocks has not come to an end. No, because the next thing he does is put it in forward and, bouncing over the wheel chocks again, drives this baggage cart right up into the plane a second time, conveyor sliding on the door lip, wheels of the cart back into the air, the whole thing, again.

I can't believe it, this all happened in one rapid event before I could even react. No one else was around. At this point, the baggage handler has finally come to his senses and stops and gets out. A few moments later several other Northwest workers come running out. I worked for another company so these weren't my coworkers and I didn't end up talking to any of them. Just wrapped up fueling and continued on with my day. 

I did tell my manager what happened and they heard that there was a baggage handler in the plane and he got hit by the conveyor and had some broken ribs. The driver of the cart was fired. The flight was cancelled and the plane sat at the airport for a couple days before being flown, empty, to Minneapolis to their maintenance facility. The concern must have been damage to whatever structure around the door creates the seal to pressurize the cargo hold. Talk about a major screw up. I still don't understand how the driver could do it. I assume trying to drive over the wheel chocks is what started it but they're so obvious and then driving it into the plane the 2nd time, it's just shocking. Felt bad for the passengers who were supposed to take the flight. Some might have seen it happen.

Also, completely unrelated, sitting eating breakfast one morning, someone had 1 slice of bread in our 2 slice toaster and when it popped, the slice flew out, flipped over, and landed perfectly in the other slot of the toaster.

Make a plan. Get some contacts, some ideas for stuff you'd want to pursue before starting up. Be honest about your situation. Analyze if you want to run under another entity's authority or your own. If you're really looking to get away from a company controlling what you do then running as your own carrier might be what you'd want to pursue, just have to figure everything out. I just went through the process of starting up and there is a lot to it. Probably want to work with an entity that can help you like ooida, dat, or tbs. Also, go in and talk to your local DMV about everything they know and deal with. They'll help you navigate a lot of it too.

Definitely check out the historic Columbia Gorge highway. This will include Multnomah Falls. If it happens to be warm and if it's open (check ahead) Oneonta Gorge is a fun place. Be prepared to get wet and wear something better than flip flops if you go there.

If it's clear in Portland can check out Council Crest. Great views.

Everett is where Boeing builds all their large planes. It's an absolutely enormous building, largest in the world by volume last I knew. They have a museum/tour. Worth checking it out along with the museum of flight if that sort of thing interests you. Also the Evergreen Aviation museum is really cool, home of the Spruce Goose. Definitely don't miss any of those If you're at all interested.

Chittendon locks in Ballard are kind of interesting. Fun to watch the process of moving boats through and you get to be right up close. Pretty much any time there will be plenty of action there.

If you like steam engines the ORHF museum in Portland is also a can't miss. 

Oregon coast is great, I'd take 101 on down most of it and I'd backtrack from Portland to start at Astoria and Ft Stevens. The dunes down south are fun. 

Come back inland for Crater lake and Oregon Caves is really interesting as well. I'm tempted to say go from there to Tahoe and then swing back to the Bay area if you want. Not really all that much of interest in Northern California.

There's a military museum on the west side of I5 across from JBLM and it seems like they're adding more and more all the time. I haven't been there but I want to sometime. They have a bunch of tanks and things sitting outside. If you're interested it might be a cool pitstop just off the freeway.

The past couple of years there have been quiet rumblings that they were cheating somehow by stealing the signs opposing teams used to communicate such as the catcher's signs to the pitcher for selecting the type of pitch. 

It hadn't really made waves much publicly, though, until one of the pitchers that was on the team when they won the world series gave details. That sent everyone into a frenzy and a internet sleuth going by jomboy started finding and posting lots of videos of the cheating where they were using a live video feed of the catcher's signs to someone just down the stairs from the dugout who would bang a trash can to indicate what pitch was coming. The batter could hear it. The tv broadcast was also picking it up, so it created quite a sensation. 

This week baseball announced penalties of 1 year suspensions for the Astros Manager(coach) and their GM, loss of draft picks for the organization, as well as a 5 million dollar fine for the organization. Later the same day the owner announced they were letting both suspended individuals go. Another manager, Alex Cora, now with the Boston Red Sox was with the Astros and was apparently involved and has also been let go.

Late this week a bunch more has come out as more people are digging into this story. Players have been saying more publicly about what they knew. It's an ongoing saga at this point. Lots of drama."

""Thus, despite clear

an estimated 5% of school employee sexual misconduct incidents known to school employees

Clearly not just a religious organization issue. This just doesn't get as much attention since it's not as ""bad sounding"" I guess.

Also, the Catholic church or other church organizations get all of it lumped in together. These issues in public schools get looked at as local issues within just that district so it doesn't make the same waves despite the issues probably being just as widespread. It just doesn't look as big as it's more segmented."

AskReddit,fcnr0sx,t3_ei6oe1,1577816807.0,"I'll share one. I used to work as an airline fueler. Fueled all the big airlines' planes at a decent sized airport. Was fueling a Northwest Airlines 757 one day and on those the fuel hookups are out under the wing so I'm up in a lift. 

As I'm standing there I see the baggage handler going to reposition the baggage cart to start loading the plane. For unloading the conveyor on the cart is placed just under the lip of the cargo door so bags can be slid out the door right onto the conveyor. For loading, it would be repositioned so the conveyor is up into the cargo hold so bags roll off the end into the hold so the person inside just has to grab and stow it. Pretty basic. 

Well anyway, all vehicles that are parked near a plane, the first thing you do is put wheel chocks in place to prevent it from moving if something occurs with brakes or whatever and this baggage cart had it's wheel chocks placed, as usual. So the baggage handler sits down in the driver seat and goes to move the cart, without picking up the chocks. How this first part went I'm not real sure because, again, I'm fueling the plane, up high probably 50 feet away, and nothing happening yet is looking unusual so I'm not paying much attention, till now. Next thing I know, this baggage handler has managed to run the conveyor up into the cargo hold to far, sliding the bottom of the conveyor on the lip of the cargo hold opening. He's gone so far that the front wheels of the cart have lifted off the ground (also where the driver seat is) because the conveyor on the plane's door lip has lifted the whole front end of the cart.

At this point, I'm probably doing the eye blinking, blank, shocked, stare. This is a highly paid(Northwest baggage handlers were the highest paid at the airport, started at $21/hr in the mid 00's), presumably experienced since they only hired experienced people, baggage handler making an insane mistake. And you'd presume that at this point, you've just connected your little vehicle to the plane, you'd stop and figure out what to do. Well, that's what I'd have done, that's hopefully what most would do, that's not what this baggage handler did.

He throws the cart in reverse, backs it up, conveyor sliding out of the plane, wheels bouncing over those chocks. So now he's backed it off the plane. Again, you'd probably stop, analyze how you've just screwed up, realize that maybe you gave it too much gas trying to get over the wheel chocks and that's how you wound up slamming the conveyor into the cargo door opening and sending your cart up into the air, and you along with it. At least, that's what I would have done, and probably you as well, heh.

But no, this story of this baggage handler, this baggage cart, this plane, and those wheel chocks has not come to an end. No, because the next thing he does is put it in forward and, bouncing over the wheel chocks again, drives this baggage cart right up into the plane a second time, conveyor sliding on the door lip, wheels of the cart back into the air, the whole thing, again.

I can't believe it, this all happened in one rapid event before I could even react. No one else was around. At this point, the baggage handler has finally come to his senses and stops and gets out. A few moments later several other Northwest workers come running out. I worked for another company so these weren't my coworkers and I didn't end up talking to any of them. Just wrapped up fueling and continued on with my day. 

I did tell my manager what happened and they heard that there was a baggage handler in the plane and he got hit by the conveyor and had some broken ribs. The driver of the cart was fired. The flight was cancelled and the plane sat at the airport for a couple days before being flown, empty, to Minneapolis to their maintenance facility. The concern must have been damage to whatever structure around the door creates the seal to pressurize the cargo hold. Talk about a major screw up. I still don't understand how the driver could do it. I assume trying to drive over the wheel chocks is what started it but they're so obvious and then driving it into the plane the 2nd time, it's just shocking. Felt bad for the passengers who were supposed to take the flight. Some might have seen it happen.

Also, completely unrelated, sitting eating breakfast one morning, someone had 1 slice of bread in our 2 slice toaster and when it popped, the slice flew out, flipped over, and landed perfectly in the other slot of the toaster. You don't have to believe me. But my mom, brother, and me all witnessed it."

Edit - to say more to this. I don't remember as much about it's initial launch with the 400 series. It wasn't as popular of a line. But when the 500 series came along, that thing was glorious, all of it. The 580 was an absolute beast, completely alone at the top. The 570 was the ""value"" beast and it too was unmatched by anything else besides the 580. And then along came the 560ti a little bit later and poof, Fermi was cemented as the rockstar of it's time as the 560ti became the new 8800gt. The affordable card that had performance creeping up close to the much more expensive top end cards. It was insanely popular. I had both, that was my upgrade path. 8800gt to 560ti. Alot of people did the same."
