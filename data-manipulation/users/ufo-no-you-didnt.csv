SubscriptionBoxes,ffm39ii,t1_ffk4kdo,1580047764.0,I used the shave gel sample that came in my starter kit last night and I think I need to get it. You are so right. It worked so much better than my normal shaving cream.

ThriftStoreHauls,ffdsg62,t1_ffdb3l9,1579827778.0,I donâ€™t and I am SO angry at myself for not taking a before picture. I realized that I forgot after my first coat of paint but it was too late :(
AskReddit,ffcz53n,t1_ffc1hek,1579810254.0,"Same thing here. I'm currently in a customer service related position (I do executive assistant duties but my title has customer service in it) and have only ever done customer service. I will say, however, that I currently work as the only FT employee at my office so pretty much every day, it's just me and  my two bosses and I don't mind customer service as much as I used to. The ""lack of coworkers"" does suck sometimes when I wan't someone to have a shared moment of bs with, but I've found a lot of joy in mostly working alone."
cats,ffct7rn,t3_essd0l,1579806773.0,So cute! I introduced my 8 mo old kitten a balloon mid-December and she played with it until it was just about out of air. Watching them run by with the string in their mouth is too much for my heart to handle.

SkincareAddicts,ffc9nzn,t1_ffc57rt,1579794705.0,"Since I have normal but dehydrated skin, I use it both AM & PM. 

If I'm good on time in the AM I do: cleanse (water only), toner, serum, hyalauronic acid, eye cream, moisturizer, sunscreen, makeup. I do other things while the serum and hyalauronic acid soak in and also so nothing on my face starts to pill, (which I learned the hard way). 

If I'm running late in the AM (lol) I do: cleanse (water only), toner, hyalauronic acid, moisturizer, makeup (my tinted moisturizer has SPF so please nobody yell at me for skipping sunscreen when I'm rushing. I do keep some in my desk and purse so I eventually get sunscreen on)

PM I do: cleanse (using an actual cleanser this time), toner, serum, hyalauronic acid, eye cream, moisturizer."

makeuporganization,ff16bjg,t1_ff12ocp,1579475623.0,"Hi! Yes I do :) I purchased the set in my acrylic organizer as part of a gift set around Christmas, and loved the products so much that I bought more. The first gift set I purchased was a bit different and had the serum, moisturizer, eye cream, and primer. I could do without the primer (since I have others that are my go tos) & think I love the Neutrogena gel cream more as my holy grail moisturizer, however, I plan to 100% re-purchase the serum and eye cream over and over again. They smell INCREDIBLE and I noticed a difference almost right away after using the products. The sets are a really nice why to try everything and the unopened one costs about $40 (without discount).

EDIT: Spelling"

beauty,feksx41,t1_fej9qki,1579206932.0,"When I had my quarter life crisis, I felt the need to buy their holographic highlighter stick and while the colour swatched really pretty, the texture felt icky to me. I currently have their setting powder and tinted brow gel in my daily rotation, however, and I consider both to be my favourites that I've tried of both types of products. TBH, I dab a little of the tinted brow gel on my nose/cheeks to add a bit more natural looking freckles (I have some on my face but idk I like freckles, sue me) and it works like an absolute charm so long as I pat them in right away."

adhdwomen,fekgoax,t3_ephc70,1579199662.0,"Oh boy do I feel this! You are so not alone. Whenever I have more than one after work activity to handle M-F I feel SO anxious and run over the details in my head over and over again. 

Side note for you, OP, or anyone else who cares to read this-I used to hate e-assistants and still do to an extent, however, one of the greatest things I ever did for myself was get a shared calendar app with my fiance. I use the app ""Famcal "" and it helps to have a second person who can help remind me of things, (not to mention I can set notifications for however long before the appt or at the time of which also get sent to my apple watch). Also, I have been more inclined to add appointments to it because it also allows him to see my schedule versus when it was just me wanting to know where I was. It also has a spot to put my/our grocery list, tasks that need to get done, anniversaries, and best of all birthdays because Lord knows I only know the date of maybe 5 people's birthdays and feel so guilty when I miss a friend's. I can assign things for both of us to worry about or just one of us too and yeah... I feel like I have my life together solely because of this app.

Before I used the app, I incorporated putting down my appointments in my work agenda/planner or outlook calendar. I'm always looking for distractions at work when I need a breather and planning my following week gave me something to focus on non-work related. Mostly I liked putting it in the agenda because I'm the only one who looks at it vs my calendar which my bosses and co-worker can see. 

Extremely long explanation/comment short, I hope you feel less anxious soon, friend <3 Sending hugs."

Hair,fdnc9p7,t1_fdluizg,1578582691.0,"Just wanted to pop in and say that I have naturally dirty blonde hair and started dying  my hair copper a few months ago. I have a colour very similar to OP's and I use Wella Color Charm dye (from Sally's) in the shade Titan Red Blonde. First time dying I mixed in some golden blonde and loved it. The next time, I went straight for Titan Red Blonde and loved it even more! I use Keracolor Clenditioner in Copper once or twice a week to keep my hair from fading. Sometimes I use my hair dying brush and brush some on my dry hair then leave it in while I clean. When I wash it out, my hair almost looks freshly dyed. Supposedly, it can turn light brown hair copper in a few washes but I never tried it like that before :)"

I get lectured ALL OF THE TIME about washing my hair almost every day and it's  started to bug me extra the last few months. If I wash my hair at let's say, 8 PM one evening, it looks greasy by the time I wake up. It's always been like that as long as I can remember. A few years back I was off from work for awhile post surgery and used the time to let my hair ""reset"" like everyone always told me to do. It did absolutely nothing. Anyways, if I have my hair up in a bun after washing it, I can get two days out of my hair but too much more than that and my head gets grimy and itchy. I like my hair routine for the most part right now and I'm sticking to it. In 2020 I plan to not let people shame me for my hair washing, lolol."
HaircareScience,fdivcj3,t1_fdigods,1578451869.0,Can confirm itâ€™s worth the buy. I got one of these a few months ago and itâ€™s been a game changer. It feels so good. Honestly sometimes I massage my head with it when Iâ€™m not in the shower and have really bad tension in my head.
