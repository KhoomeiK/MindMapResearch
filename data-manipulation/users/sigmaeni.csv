Just as an overall explanation of what I mean... I'm probably considered an optimistic nihilist. I think nothing about life or the universe matters, there is no purpose. The enjoyment we get out of life could be considered the only thing worth considering as some form of purpose, in other words we create our own purpose, despite the fact that it is ultimately inconsequential.

So for most/all of your questions, the options given were irrelevant. All of my answers would have been like: ""I like sci-fi, because of the math and physics involved""; ""I enjoy a complex storyline""; ""I'm eager to see well-made CGI""; etc... So most of the answers I could give were None/Other/Disagree. I think my limited ability to answer would make my dataset a poor component of your survey because I know my answers were disconnected from the options given even though I had to choose something."

If you want to murder someone, you can. If you think you'll get caught, maybe you have ""a quite uncreative mind"".

We're limited by our technology in exploring the galaxy. Doesn't mean that if we develop the technology, we aren't free to go on an adventure. Alternatively, this is a vastly different definition of freedom than societal freedoms and others of that sort. If you want to teleport to the far reaches of the galaxy, you'd need to be some other form of being or energy to do so. I'm not convinced that the argument of ""i'm not free because I can't teleport"" is terribly logical.

You're right, your biology is limiting you to your age.

You can have sex with anyone you want. Have you taken Adriana to dinner to see if it's possible? Probably not, so we'll set aside your argument here for now... 

You CAN be 7 feet tall. We do have that technology. Not sure where the argument goes on this one.

For the most part, we are indeed free within the bounds of what the universe has made us to be, aside from those limitations we (society, etc) put on ourselves. Should I blame my inability to float through space on the failures of rocket scientists who have not yet developed the PersonalRocket? Probably not. That doesn't make sense. There's a difference between universal limits, and those that arise from where we are biologically/technologically/socially.

For example, a black person 100 years ago complaining ""I'm not free because I can't eat in that restaurant"" need only ""wait a few years"" and suddenly he is free to do so. Perhaps you'd like all freedoms that will ever be possible, to be available right now. Is that a reasonable argument, or just impatience?

Or maybe you want to travel faster than light. I'm not sure if being bound by the nature of the universe is a ""lack of freedom"" at all really, is it?

Get those creative brain juices pumping! 

Or don't, it won't matter after we die anyway. :) Eat some cake, ponder how beautiful the universe is. Say hello to every atom in your being, and figure what a neat coincidence it is that they all arrived in you after 14 billion years, and an infinite space where the could have otherwise been instead. Grow old, look back on what you've done, who you've been and realize that's all there will be to everything you'll ever know. Then die. The end. Helluva thing."

nihilism,fdbsfef,t1_fdbf26n,1578261245.0,"Indeed, a side effect of a tool such as our evolved brains is the inherent tendency to find (or at least expect or even hope for) purpose and meaning where there may not be any. Interestingly, that's another derivation of our brain as a survival tool - if our ancient ancestors saw a branch move, it *might* mean that a predator was lurking. Even if we're wrong, it's a safe thing to assume that meaning (we don't die from being wrong in that scenario, but we may be saved by that assumption if it's true!). At the modern-day point in our evolution, that tendency is baked in. However, we now think about things more complex than ""branch move... predator?"" So now it's ""particles coherent... what's the meaning?"" There's no consequence for our instinctual necessity to [incorrectly] associate atoms doing things with meaning - *they just do things - it is the way it is because it is!*. If we're wrong and there is no meaning, who cares, but if we *think* we might be right that there is meaning.... then religion, cosmic purpose, etc. arise... Doesn't mean we're actually right, just that our brain is much more comfortable wondering ""what's the meaning?"" instead of ""there is no meaning"". *Thanks, cavemen. Sheesh!*"
