Online battles are okay too. This sounds kinda douchy but get your ass kicked until you get to the lower ranks and farm wins on casual. You get 50FM per win and 1000FM for a character level up

That strategy takes a while and I don't recommend it but it's there. You probably don't even need that much FM in the game"

To get used to doing the inputs you said it yourself, training mode. To get it in battle look up a SPD setup on youtube. Off the top of my head you can SPD someone on their wakeup. Another thing is to do cr.lp on block into SPD.


Just take every chance to do the SPD and if it comes out think of it as an execution victory. Even if it's wrong and you get punished for it, the goal should be to make it come out consistently. Landing it would be the next step"

wholesomeanimemes,fewr48u,t1_fewnket,1579418244.0,"I mean I see what the author is going for. Each side character has trouble communicating/awkward/insecure in their own way and komi has to slowly grow throughout the manga. The problem is most of the side characters don't affect komi as much.


(No spoilers) characters like manbagi or Komi's cousin push komi but the other 80% of them have  no significant impact on the story as a whole. Sort of like the author is trying to hit that 100 friend quote for komi's goal.


They still follow the theme of the manga and I can see how/why it's popular but that's just my opinion. I enjoy keeping up with it but it's not one of my favorite manga. If there is any consolation, it would be nice to see a snapshot of each side character as Komi's 100 friends at the end of the manga"
