AskReddit,fg8v1s3,t3_exk7he,1580630074.0,"That all women want kids, and if they don’t they surely must be some kind of monster, or there is something wrong with them. No! Some of us don’t want to force our crappy genetics on someone else. Some of us just really don’t like kids. Some of us are more into our careers, or our hobbies, or just having peace and quiet. Some of us have chronic illnesses and have a hard enough time dealing with our own daily struggle. Some of us wouldn’t make good moms for whatever reason. Or any combination of any of these."

childfree,ffy15hn,t3_evthey,1580336496.0,"So true! Our friends have two small kids, and two medium sized, neurotic dogs. They invited themselves along on one of our camping trips. NEVER again! I was initially against them coming along, but my husband wanted to spend some time with them, and so I went along with it. I figured it would be annoying but not THAT bad. Bad decision, it was 10x worse than I ever dreamed. The whole trip was spent with them trying to appease their kids or their dogs or both. A lot of the time they acted like they expected us to do the same... no thank you! The one thing we wanted to do on the whole trip they complained about, despite the fact that they didn’t need to come along. The dad spent most of the time freaking out about the kids or the dogs behaviors, then had the balls to say that it was the worst vacation of his life... like yeah dude, it wasn’t exactly peachy for us either."
childfree,ffxytgj,t3_evsjf1,1580335102.0,"I agree. What makes it worse is that we also give tons of tax breaks to people with kids. I personally know someone who got more taxes back than they paid in because of child care credits. So the people who use the most resources pay the least, even though it’s their CHOICE to have kids. Cancer/major illness isn’t a choice, but we give very little in the way of tax breaks to people in those situations. A lot of these policies make absolutely no sense to me."
aww,ffsbz2k,t3_euwls8,1580178085.0,"I feel the same. Cats will always hold a special place in my heart. As a child literally the only love I got was from my cat. My stepdad was insanely jealous, if my mom gave me any attention at all he would go into fits of rage. My cat definitely saved my life, if it weren’t for her I’m not sure I would have made it into adulthood and out of that horrible situation. She lived to be almost 20 years old. Please give your sweet kitty a hug for me."

TechNewsToday,ffj65ro,t1_ffijvob,1579991385.0,"As a woman, we DO always need to be on alert. I’ve had multiple instances over the years where men get irrationally angry simply because the attraction they felt wasn’t mutual on my end. It’s a scary place to be. I can’t force myself to be attracted to someone that I’m not. I don’t understand why that elicits an anger response in some guys. If someone doesn’t want to be with me, I will happily move along so I can find someone who does. *Most* men will never know the fear of being overpowered, held against your will, raped, etc.

I still live my life freely, but staying safe in my surroundings is always in the back of my mind when I am making any decisions that could potentially put me in a dangerous place. I’ve learned that lesson the hard way."
Noom,fez096w,t1_feylefk,1579452665.0,"That worked. It wasn’t much, different, but it did read a slightly lower weight when I got back on after my husband weighed himself with it. Thank you!"
Noom,feyikv0,t3_eqwvhw,1579445932.0,"I can relate! In the month that I’ve been on the program I first gained a couple pounds right away, and have since been stuck at 160.7 for nearly a month straight. Like I don’t vary an ounce from day to day. To the point that I’m I’m starting to wonder if a digital scale can possibly get stuck somehow? My weight used to fluctuate up 2-3lbs+ in a day, so it’s pretty odd. It’s starting to get kind of comical, if it wasn’t so frustrating."
AskReddit,fesxyq1,t1_feso8qk,1579370072.0,I gave my nephew an Elmo doll one year when it was the “had to have” toy that Christmas. He opened it up and it laughed/sang/whatever the hell that creepy thing did... and he immediately started crying. I probably scarred him for life.

Apparently Angelina Jolie directed the film adaptation, but from what I’ve heard it’s so terrible that I refuse to watch the movie."

AskReddit,feovqzs,t3_eq8qlr,1579306455.0,"I spent weeks insulating our basement. I was using leftover rolls from another project. Our house is screwy, so I had to cut every single batt down the long way. It was puffing out from the studs a bit, but my husband had assured me that the drywall should “squish it down” when we hung it on the wall. We go to hang drywall and NOPE... all the pressure popped the sheetrock right off the screws. Needless to say my husband ended up cutting and hanging the second round of insulation himself with a thinner insulation."

AskReddit,feo7l0p,t3_eq6jxo,1579296243.0,"I left a job in management, where I was so unhappy I used to fantasize about various ways I could end my life on the drive in to work every morning. I finally told my husband that he was going to come home to find me swinging from a tree if I didn’t do something. A few days later a customer came into my work and started talking about how she and her husband ran a janitorial company, and how lucrative it was when you were trustworthy. A few days later I gave my two weeks notice. I was terrified. We relied on both of our incomes. I immediately started my own cleaning business. I did it for almost 20 years, and absolutely loved it. I am fairly introverted and enjoy spending a lot of time alone. Most of the time no one was home, or in the buildings, so I could listen to my podcasts or music while I was working and just get my work done in peace. I loved being physically active, and I loved that people were happy that I was making their lives easier, so I worked very hard, especially for the people who let me know they appreciated what I was doing. It took a while to build my clientele up to where I was making what I did in the job I left, but within two years I was turning down work because I was so busy. It’s one of the best decisions I’ve made in my life."

AngelFish,feiwh7b,t1_feicvhw,1579149105.0,"You are correct. Glofish are not injected. They are genetically modified using various proteins from naturally fluorescing corals, jellyfish, anemones, etc. They pass on their fluorescence to some of their fry, which isn’t possible in dyed fish. I worked in pet stores a long time ago, when dyed fish were more common, and they look very different from glofish. In (“painted”) dyed fish the dye stays primarily in their body and is usually somewhat splotchy. In glofish, ALL of the fish fluoresces, even the eyes, which looks somewhat creepy tbh. The process of “painting” fish  was/is just horrible and wrong. Glofish were originally created to help us in various experiments, and have actually been really helpful in some scientific advancements. I’m personally not fond of them as pets, my personal preference is a more natural looking fish (and I was truly hoping to like them, because I am really into fluorescent gems and minerals, but the way their entire being fluoresced was just kind of unsettling to me)."
AngelFish,feiqh6d,t3_ep9o97,1579144662.0,"I actually think these fish have a pretty interesting history. The fluorescent danios were originally developed to test for toxins in water. The more toxic, the more they would glow. They are incredibly useful for a lot of different research now as well. That being said, I did keep glo-tetras and danios for a while, and the danios didn’t breed and most of the fry were fluorescent, but there was something just “off” about the way all of them acted, including the parents. I have a similar species of (natural) Tetra in one of my tanks now, and their behavior is completely different."
Psoriasis,feipoac,t1_feh6wxy,1579144115.0,"We had to use this on my horse when he ripped his leg open very badly. The vet warned us to be VERY careful to only use it with clean, freshly washed hands because it absorbs whatever is on the skin into the skin and into your bloodstream. Maybe he was just being overly dramatic, but that was 30 years ago and I still remember what he said because of the way he cautioned us."
