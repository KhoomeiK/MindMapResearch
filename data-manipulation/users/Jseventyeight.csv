Thanks! 
Sometimes I amuse me, too.  HA!   
I actually hadn't considered a difference in Lonely & Lonesome, but they *do* have slightly distinct textures, don't they? That's interesting as well.  
I believe lonely is right, which is what I originally had to stop a moment to consider when I saw the 'full room' statement. It perked my ears up. I had to circle it a bit and sniff around, just a hair. It gave me paws...err... pause, before the ridiculous tangent was...well...*unleashed*.
Also, I can see several ways to take the Great Day/Blue curtains exercise. My favorite may be that our dear author might simply be a fan of some hues more than others - read it as though that were a semicolon instead. Changes the texture completely...might really tie the room together, perhaps."

The second kick probably really crossed the line, of course. But...I don't know. We can type comments all day, but I have had a few very high-adrenaline moments in life, including a couple fights when I was a young man. Its not an on/off switch. So...its super easy for us to say 'stop' from here,  but...realistically? Its probably supposed to work that way. But, if we say hes justified taking action, then I'm not sure *exactly* where or when we get the moral high ground deciding where he stops that action. Be careful taking things too far, folks. Sometimes its not so simple to un-snap. We're still primates, just wrapped in cloth."
creepy,fgopug9,t1_fgnr9oq,1580980655.0,"I definitely agree with your last statement there. I'll add that I think language is, too...at least, it is to me. We see beautiful art, so we *communicate* those reactions and interpretations you mentioned. Right? \[Behold, a forthcoming wild tangent, pointless and for no good reason, other than I found a word interesting, I have nothing better to do, and there's no one else here...Ha! come to think of it, maybe I'll come back to that part later, I guess.\] Nevermind. Moving on:

Quoting you:

"" **>In my opinion, the feeling of loneliness is the one you feel when you're alone in a full room; ...""**

Ok...that's an interesting take. But that really leaves me wondering now...whats (in your opinion) the one where you feel alone in the *empty* room? I've been calling -that- one loneliness. It goes away when there's people; I just don't have a lot of people around anymore. So, if I'm not feeling *lonely*, what do you name it?

(I'm not really trying to call you out or anything, btw. It's genuinely interesting to me how we all think about or name different things but apply the same words; or think of the same thing, but describe it in vastly different ways, or how the same words give different people such wildly different impressions of what someone means.)

Anyway, if we took it further, you might answer that mine is *solitude* instead...or I might think it's your example of the emotional state you described that actually fits that word better, since ""alone"" is the root word of lonely and 'Solitude' is named like Superman's emo hut - so that's obviously gotta be the emo one. That's just science.

No one is wrong, they're not facts. Impressions, reactions, interpretations. *Communications*. But then, maybe we get our point across, and maybe we don't.

I say that because out of curiosity, I googled 'loneliness vs solitude'. The results also said tons of various things, completely inconsistently. Every other result defined something differently. It was beautiful. I only glanced through a few articles, but some contend 'solitude' is a state of physical isolation, without any consideration of emotion...and others that 'solitude' is an emotional state, of being ""at peace with or enjoying your physical isolation"". Complete opposites. Some agree with you that loneliness is a feeling of isolation *when among other people*, and some say its me being sad at being alone when I'm alone.  \[Side note: surprisingly, NONE of the articles I clicked on had the phrase 'Superman's Emo Hut' at all, though, so either none of those writers can be trusted anyway, or the more *awesome* authors were further down the list than I went.\] Another even said solitude is when you choose it, and loneliness is when it just happens to you. I hadn't even considered that one.

Anyway...Neat, huh? I find this stuff interesting, but thought the Google search results probably also hold some valuable analogous societal clues about our growing divisions since you're more likely to enjoy or reference the article that agreed with you, and so am I, and until we can bridge the...no, no I'm totally just kidding. I'll leave that shit...uh...<ahem> *alone*.

But just like that whole societal thing...*I* kinda think the answer is really somewhere in the middle...I think loneliness is **""feeling alone""**. Maybe feeling alone while being actually alone, or maybe people are around but a connection with them isn't, but either way, that's how I see ""lonely"". That's just me.

(Of course, this could also be why, I guess...I say FAR too much weird shit, especially in long, pointless tangents.)

So...yeah. fun stuff. Cheers."

I like these guys a lot for something different. I just found them not too long ago, couple of months ago at most. I'm sure a bunch here know them already, but if you don't, they're pretty damn decent. As far as genre goes...I'd put them in playlists with bands like 'Cursive' or 'Spoon', or 'gP.' or maybe even leaning a little toward some of what 'Thrice' or 'Highly Suspect' has done. They're rock, but not real heavy. Highlight tracks 'Nutrition' or 'Speed Dial' are good places to start.

I like it OK; 1000x times more than the Tobacco collab he did last year. I love Aes, he's one of my favorite artists, full stop - but that last album...I'm just gonna say it just wasn't for me. (in the words of the almighty Primus, 'they can't all be zingers', right?) But this is back to his more usual style, at least. He's gonna have a helluva time ever topping 'Impossible Kid' or stuff like 'Coffee' or a ton of other things he's done. This doesn't, but its well worth a play.

Otherwise, I know I'm way late to the game here, but I just discovered Allan Rayman a week or two ago, and can't lie, I binge-listened to all his albums on Spotify, and I like it - a lot.

'Rose' caught my ear first, then I went on to listen to more of that album, then the rest of his catalog. Dude's damn good, for something chill. He does R&B-ish, Bluesy rock-ish...IDK. Its just good.

It wasn't. It's only been a consideration now, after.

Anyway, thanks. Kind words change lives. I appreciate yours. Cheers."

The addict isn't the addicted person, in the same way the sick person isn't the patient. But the personality changes in both do 'lose' them to us anyway. I wish we humans could understand experiences, that we haven't had, a little better. It would be nice if people could 'get it' but I sure wouldn't wish any of it on anyone. I'm sure you weren't the only one thinking that about your friend's dad the same way I wonder if the woman I asked out was thinking it about me. (Again, I don't know that, I may have screwed that up in any of a dozen other ways, too. Dating was never my strong suit. I just think I felt it there in the air when I said it.)"

She wasn't my first wife, and I've lived four years outside this marriage for every one I was in it, so I have all of this other time to draw on as I try to start over.

And I do mean all - you're going to feel hopeless, you're going to feel rage, and you're going to feel pretty OK some days. You're going to feel better, you're going to laugh at funny things you see. That's all okay. I almost felt guilty the first time I laughed, but...to hell with that. Grief is so strange. The things that you think are going to set it off the worst, won't be what really does it, and things you never expected to have any effect will hit you like a truck. I saw a widower, who had been outwardly very stoic about everything, break down in a restaurant when he was offered a slice of key lime pie, which had been his wife's favorite. You can't steer it, there's not any way you're supposed to feel, there's not any way you should be trying to feel. Just...feel. And if you can expect that you're going to feel it all, it really helps when you need to be able to look at some of the worst, the most overwhelming parts and say, ok this is one of them. I'm feeling like I can't take it but its just one of the things I'm going to feel and there will be others, and gain some power over it that way. Or that has helped me, anyway...I'm not the guy for advice, and I know you didn't ask me for any, but I wanted to say that."

At that time, the *only* alone time I would get was half of my drive to work, and half the drive home. That's about 15m or just under, each week day. Hell, I worked in an office with people, too. There were a lot of times I definitely wished for more. A day at home alone was like...the dream. And it only happened a couple of times over a span of a few years, and I know that was bad for me, but...damn now thats its just me, this is way worse. And Ive struggled with guilt for the times I wished for alone time, (thats irrational but knowing it doesnt fix it). No one to drop off on the way to work anymore, and I got my own office down the hall from everyone else, and it really is the opposite of that life in every way.

Not the same thing. If it was random, set a piece of pie in front of him and he may or may not eat it. He sees more opportunity in chaos and loves to spread it everywhere. I certainly wasn't accusing him of 4D chess, I didn't mean he had some supervillian master plan with lots of moving pieces, or even knowing what he wants this man in pocket for, not specifically, not in a 4D chess, Frank Underwood kinda way. He doesn't need to. Its easy math. Bad guy + favor = owe me = good. Which we have seen with him over and over and over again. Its THE math formula he knows by heart. Its literally the formula he's lived his life by. How is being *this type of* opportunistic not obvious with him? As obvious as his racism? Its one of the defining traits of who he is. You say 'based on nothing' but racking favors with powerful people is why we even know his name. No one honest thinks he didn't want a favor from Ukraine, so why can't they see it with this guy too? That SEAL's willingness to kill in the way he did is a type of power and I'm gonna call you naive again for not seeing that. Its wild, I guess but wild is what we live now. It isn't based on nothing. I'm not a conspiracy theorist, nor a crazy person. And he isn't random. He's formulaic. He loves doing his deeds blatantly in front of everyone, thats an extra kick for him, and he pocketed that man right in front of everyone, because everyone is still out here trying their best to pretend the norms still apply in 2020 and he knows better, and has proved it over, and over, and over again. And hey, maybe he never taps that favor. [a hundred quotes with ""maybe I'll do it, maybe not"" go here. Ever heard him say that?] But if you think he hasn't had this idea or seen the potential for it you certainly don't understand him nearly as well as you think you do."

Just to be clear about what you said... In your 2nd scenario there, ""or she could abort a kid that you would have taken sole responsibility""... so theres this woman who would terminate an unwanted pregnancy, but the father says he wants that baby, so you're saying she should be forced to carry it for him? Endure pregnancy and any of its possible complications, and give birth, because he prefers it? Thats...Jesus, man, think about that. You'd do that to her? I can't even imagaine being her and living that nightmare. Can you? I know it happens, and has happened through history, but I think we're supposed to be better than that, aren't we? 
And in the 1st scenario you mentioned, I guess the opposite? Is that a forced termination? So he doesn't have to pay child support? How did you come to opinions like these? I hope you'll put a little more thought into this. Because from here, those look pretty awful, honestly."

Its not a stigma thing, its that for over a year now I think I've had a solid 95% of all my meals alone. Sometimes that part is way worse than anything else is. Its the eating that really drives the point home, for me. It kinda makes me not care what the food is, too. Half the time supper is something like a bowl of cereal or a slapped together sandwich I eat quickly standing at the kitchen counter over a paper towel, so I can just go on to something else. But for your point, theres very little I wouldn't do because its just me. Movies, restraunts, travel, sure if theres something I wanna do or see, I definitely do.

LetsTalkMusic,ff96zai,t3_er7tsu,1579706308.0,"I sure wish I hadn't come so late to this thread. This exact topic has been on my mind a lot lately. An awful lot, actually. I'll answer the question 'what are they' in a minute, but since we're in Let's Talk, I think I will, for this one. Hopefully I have some sort of **context, analysis, thought out opinions, or otherwise discussion oriented content.** And let me say right up front, these *aren't* recommendations. None of it is.     

Let me start by saying there's one album that's such an extreme example, I absolutely can't hear one more word of it, probably ever. It's been recommended multiple times in this thread, and I discussed it and my experience with it in a reply to one of them. I won't go back into all that here. That's 'A Crow Looked at Me'. That's a no-go-zone for me. Too Far.   

For me, it usually isn't full albums, though. But I definitely have some songs that do to me exactly what's described here, and I made a playlist of them, so I guess *that's* my album. But yes, I certainly must be careful with it. Even while I was assembling it, I knew what I was doing was...questionable, at best. (That's probably an understatement.) I knew every time I pressed 'add to playlist' or changed what order it was in, I was playing with my well-being; that I'd cause myself real pain with these, and that's exactly why I was doing it. I knew I'd sit here alone in the dark and play it on the good speakers. 

I think about the act of using music masochistically like this. It seems like its something a lot of people do, to one degree or another. I see a lot of mentions of catharsis when it's discussed. And I know it can be that - when used responsibly. And I keep going back to analogies about drugs and alcohol, but the thing is, I don't see it as an analogy. Not really. I honestly think this IS a drug. I'm going to draw on analogies from there, though. People who haven't ever had a history of using may not really relate as well to my thoughts on this, I don't know. But when I made the playlist, it wasn't slapped together in a few minutes.. It took a long time. Hours, and hours. It was drawing back that syringe. Tying off. Yeah, better be careful with that. 

I'm certain there are a million degrees of this act. From ""oh this song sounds sad, with her voice drifting over the piano that way, so beautiful, it really gives me the feels"", or ""he/she broke up with me, and this singer must really get it"" to ""this was our song"". Sure, its sad. But then there's ""I'm deeply grieving the loss of my closest loved one and this was their favorite song"", or ""we used to listen to it together"" or, well, ""this singer really gets it"".  These aren't the same drugs, though. Not even close. And when I do this, I'm all hopped up on those last ones, personally. Like a kite.  

For me to hear Dax Riggs bellow out ""*Scaring the ghosts away / Wake me when / I'm sane again""* or ""*The cold of death / It may tear you from my breast / But I know - you are the smoke that is my breath*"" it isn't just a sad song. It's gut-wrenching. It's a full dose of whatever it is we get from  doing this. Its that ride home alone from the hospital. \[*Waking Up Insane*, from 'If This is Hell Then I'm Lucky', 2008\]

Or how about Nick Cave saying '*This is the weeping song, But...I won't be weeping long*.' \[*The Weeping Song*, from The Good Son, 1990\]

'I'll See You All In Hell or New Orleans' or 'Say Goodnight to the World' (Dax Riggs). 'Waiting on a Train' (Mark Lanegan). 'Silence of the Setting Sun' (Amber Asylum). 'Death Trip to Tulsa' (Mark Lanegan). 'Wasteland' (The Black Heart Procession). Yes, I do believe it's a drug. I assure you there's a chemical reaction in us when these tracks cut the deepest, When they evoke the strongest memories or emotion. When someone doing this to themselves tries to see how many times they can tear themselves in half.  

This thread isn't the first time lately I've seen someone ask about other people's ""saddest music for the sake of being sad"".  And, sure some of this drug can be shared; I could drop a track here, with universal human themes of sorrow, that might affect anyone, pass that around the circle and most people could take a big hit. Like 'Teardrop' \[Massive Attack, from Mezzanine, 1998\] or  'Built on Ashes'. ""*At the end of the day / with the lights out / you are bound to die alone (we are bound to die alone)... / At the end of it all / There is no doubt / We are bound to die alone (we were born to die alone)/ \[*Zeal & Ardor, 'Built on Ashes' from *Stranger Fruit,* 2018\] 

But when 'The Devil and The Almighty Blues' say ""*I only hear you...I only hear you from a distance now*"", the song is kinda rockin'. It doesn't sound sad. If you closed your eyes and picture a smokey biker bar, this could easily be the song playing. It's one we'd play around our pool table in our bar at home, and she'd always nod her head along to. It's very unlikely to affect anyone else but me. It's no dirge. But it grabs me by my throat, both for the memories and the new twist on those words. That's a needle, personal use item. \[The Devil and the Almighty Blues, *Distance,* from self-titled, 2015\]    

So...why do we do this to ourselves? Catharsis? I mean...it may play a part, its probably what anyone doing this is *chasing* anyway. And some people may find it, you know, using responsibly and all. Some people will have one drink and relax, too, and never know what kind of damage the rest of that bottle can do to a person's night. Or life. But I think what degree of this you're at, and how strong the personal connection to the pain in the song is, really matters too. The deeper you're going here, the less benefit there is, and the more you just suffer. Like a high dose of speed will make you feel very sleepy. Go too far, you aren't gonna get what you're after. 

But, then again, years ago I watched a woman, a grieving mother, lay on a toddler-sized bed in a brightly colored room, hug a teddy bear in the fetal position and listen to 'You are my sunshine' on repeat. For days. Literally. It was one of the more upbeat versions, too, which just felt even more twisted, to me. She was as utterly broken as anyone I've ever seen and I really hope no one I see ever tops it. Everyone was going crazy, trying to get her up, trying to *help* her, any way they knew how. I sat by her and said  'listen, this can't be healthy. This isn't good. You're just torturing yourself, and you know it.' And she agreed, but said this was what was keeping her alive right then; and that I should fuck off. I did, because I believed her. And, today she's alive, she seems pretty well, even. Maybe she was right, and it was. I don't know. I didn't come here with answers. If I had answers, I don't guess I'd be doing the same thing, huh?  

The point to all of this, though, is if one's going to do this to themselves, especially in any of the extremes, I hope they ask themselves some questions. I do it, but I've made a lot of bad choices. I'm pretty used to picking up the pieces of me, maybe someday I put em back right. I meant what I said about none of this being a recommendation, though, which is why those aren't links. I don't see a big difference in this and someone sitting in a bathroom floor cutting themselves with a razor blade, except I think thighs probably heal better sometimes. 

So, I'll just...tell people to be careful doing this. They can tell me to fuck off.  

But maybe there is this one.

I got as far as a line about ""taking out the trash and coming back inside and..."" ...and if I'd let him say another word out loud right then I might not have been able to handle it. None of the songs that I use, to hurt, have ever affected me like that one was going to. Those work for what I need, this was a mainlined overdose, completely uncut. After a few minutes gathering myself, I literally got my coat and keys and left my house for the sole purpose of not being in that room, after just that much of that song. Don't even know if I made it a minute in, don't wanna know. Hell, I put NPR on in the car just in case, instead of Spotify. Parked out by the lake for a bit and just sat. Went and got a cherry limeade and went home, maybe a couple hours total. I probably won't ever hear it, or the rest of the album, or any of his others, actually - But I don't think I need to. Pretty sure I know the words to those songs.
All I can say, I guess is be careful mixing hard grief with some songs. Like drugs and alcohol. Feels good, til it doesn't.

But, I lived that album. The same way he did. Our stories are fairly similar. My wife and I were together for 13yrs, lost her to liver cancer, about a year and a half ago. So, there may come a day I can do that one. And there may not. Maybe that one isn't good for the ones it's happened to. Or hell, maybe it's just me.

ifyoulikeblank,fesrgfn,t3_eq7tm9,1579368235.0,"You chose two of my favorite tracks in the world, friend. And I have searched a lot for this, but those two are very rare gems. Here's a short little playlist of about as close as I've been able to find, and none of them *quite* fit the bill, but they all share multiple traits, and are probably all inside the WEWIL umbrella. They are for me, anyway.

Nothing really sounds like either of those two songs, because what those two songs have in common is breaking every foundational rule of the genres they're supposed to belong in. (Psych,Prog/Desert,Stoner). They're both completely clean. No fuzz. Just that, is almost unheard of for these bands and anyone like them. And you can find a few other fuzz-free tracks, but how many of those also have no trap set? (every song on the list I posted has one, btw.) Now make it slow, dark tones, with forward basslines and recessed drums, with somber vocals?  These guys were rock bands. That isn't what rock bands *do.* When you do find psych thats dark and mellow, its fuzzy. When you find clean Psych, it's more trippy and upbeat and lighter and almost guaranteed to have a trap set.  

I could answer WEWIL to them all day, but actually similar is a very tall order. They're just special. 

(side note, the Bill Frisell track the other commenter posted checks far more of the boxes than most anything else I've found. And that might be because he's breaking all of *his* genres' rules, into this direction - it's all a big Venn Diagram, and these tracks just fall into the right spots between the circles, where most artists don't go.)

I hope to find more, though. If you do, please let me know.

This one is from 2012, but I like it. It might actually be a little *too* Tool for some people. When I was playing it back then, a friend told me they thought these guys were doing a Tool impersonation, but thats not how I see it. Its a good album, imo.

For me, Dream Theater has always been a band I -respect- more than *enjoy,* so idk how to help you much there, but Moore & Portnoy had this other project, called OSI, and I love a bunch of their stuff. Not all, they have some I didn't dig that much, but like...how can you not love this? :

\^ thats just damn good music to me. They have a ton of great tracks, they're just a bit hit-or-miss for me.

Then there's these guys...think 'jam band' but for a bit more prog-metal. Most of their stuff is instrumental, but they have some vocals in later albums. If you have the patience for a 14-min track thats a whole epic journey, rising, peaking, falling...then you'll dig these guys. Not everyone does, and I totally get that. Here's a pretty representative track, its like 7min, if you like this track, you'll like this band. (the 14-min epic is called ""Icarus"", btw. I like it.)

and finally, we go all the way back to '06 for a track that I love. TBH, I haven't listened to much or maybe any of their other stuff, so can't speak on it, but I think I will now that I remember this exists.

All this time, I had no idea. (btw, why isn't his death in their bio on Spotify? They do have a bio posted. I'd think thats one of the things that should be there. Just sayin'.) 
And, since he died of Lukemia that year...puts a whole new spin on listening to it, knowing he must have been sick and/or dying when he recorded that album. 
""If the sun was always shining and our load always light / we'd be shaking like a leaf on any god-given night / We'd break under the weight of any pain that ever came in this life""  (yes I know thats from Salt for Salt, but...man. Listening to it again now just feels different.)"

Honestly, I've only skimmed through the replies here, and several things I'd suggest are already here, but I don't have a ton of time right now to read them all, but I definitely want to come back when I do. In the meantime, let me drop a couple things here: 

First and foremost, this track:

then:

&#x200B;

This playlist is good, but didn't *really* scratch the itch for what I was looking for. It has some gems on it though, and is updated often enough to be worth following. It has a more rock elements than what I really wanted though:

[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1dAi1b9IPs6hU5IaLPONug?si=dbEULuY9T12Y9R1ofv-XNw](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1dAi1b9IPs6hU5IaLPONug?si=dbEULuY9T12Y9R1ofv-XNw)

&#x200B;

But, here's some of what I've compiled through just doing some digging. 

[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5HSKR8qZLjDlTUDOx1fSAw?si=Za\_RQImRTz6gi6BR6ShwVg](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5HSKR8qZLjDlTUDOx1fSAw?si=Za_RQImRTz6gi6BR6ShwVg)

&#x200B;

now before I go, I'm gonna drop this one, too. But it definitely isn't all country. A lot of it has some country elements to it though, and even if it isn't exactly, I really like it all, and I think it all fit pretty well.
