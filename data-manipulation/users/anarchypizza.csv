ketobeginners,ffvnawr,t3_evgmws,1580268166.0,"sugar and sugar alcohols are different in how they impact your blood sugar, and only sugar alcohols should be subtracted from the carbs. the most common sugar alcohol in keto products is erythritol, but other sugar alcohols are  sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, maltitol (see a pattern?). sugar alcohols are not already included in the fiber count as they are not fiber."
intermittentfasting,ffusruw,t1_ffurkic,1580248662.0,"Committing to it is definitely the hardest part, but once I did, it really changed my relationship with food. Another thing that really helped is really just picking up a new hobby. I have all this free time now that I'm not thinking about or making food, I needed something new to fill up the free time. I've been reading more books, painting, and started learning and practicing digital photo editing. Having something to occupy your brain and hands helps so much."
intermittentfasting,ffurbkz,t3_evba27,1580247857.0,"I have found that OMAD has helped me stop snacking, eventually helped me control cravings, and definitely helped me become less food focused overall. I feel like when I ate normally, so much of my brain was dedicated to food, always thinkin about the next meal or snack. Meal planning and a little meal prepping also helped, just knowing what I was going to eat was set in stone helped me not focus on it. Both my husband and I do keto, though he doesn't do OMAD, but the higher fat foods definitely help me feel satiated for longer."

When I clicked the link, it said the coupon was no longer available. Disappointed, I sent them an email explaining how I was looking forward to the coupon and if there was another way to receive it since the link wasn't working. I did not hear back from them via email, but a couple weeks later I received a letter in the mail from Halo Top HQ. Inside were 3 coupons, 2 $1 off a pint coupons, and a coupon for the halo top pops. The letter that was included stated that I could request coupons every 6 months. The coupons don't expire until the end of the year either."

When its nice and soft and melty, i throw in the shredded cheese.  I just had colby on hand, tossed in the zoodles and chopped bacon and some seasonings. I'll start a nacho sauce or alfredo sauce a similar way, with the butter and cream cheese to start, then melting in whatever cheeses, seasonings and addons I want. Works pretty well and its super easy. 

Edit: forgot that i do add heavy cream as needed to thin it out however much I need. Usually add it when I add the shredded cheese."

keto,fecstkm,t3_eoh9k2,1578983259.0,"baking cheese slices or piles of shredded cheese on parchment paper or a silicone baking mat makes some nice cheese chips, and you can experiment with seasonings and add-ins. baking pepperoni slices til they're crispy is good. cutting up a low carb tortilla chip and spraying them with avocado or coconut oil can make really easy tortilla chips. ive been working on zucchini chips, tried a lotta different recipes, but havent quite got the right thickness/crunch yet."
keto,feak0cy,t3_eo9gub,1578949739.0,"definitely tons of eating out options for keto. most american style casual dining restaurant will have fish or steak plus a veggie - broccoli, green beans, collard greens are good choices. bbq places have a variety of meats, just ask for no sauce or sauce on the side. salads with a lot of meat and cheese and a creamy dressing are a pretty safe bet. many sushi places have naruto style rolls wrapped in thin sliced cucumber instead of rice and seaweed. egg foo young at chinese restaurant is fine i think, its an egg pancake with usually like, cabbage and bean sprouts and meat in it. buffets in general are pretty good for being able to kinda build your own meals, using things from the salad bar and the various meats available. some chinese buffet restaurants have where you pick your meat and veggies and they stir fry it for you. non-breaded hot wings are a favorite. Saag paneer is awesome if you're lookin for indian food. Its basically cubes of paneer cheese with cream and spinach and spices. brazilian churrascarias are amazing for keto but can be pricey, though I have had good luck with buy one/get one frees on groupon. chick-fil-a has grilled chicken nuggets, popeyes has blackened chicken strips, blaze pizza has a cauliflower crust pizza, bunless/lettuce wrapped burgers at nearly every burger place, get your sub in a bowl for a very filling salad. any breakfast place or diner is super easy with eggs, sausage, bacon, veggies. chipoltle salad bowls - skip the rice and beans and corn salsa."

While it's cooking, top it with tomato sauce and whatever other toppings. Shit is so good, the cheese gets super crispy like a real nice thin crust pizza.
