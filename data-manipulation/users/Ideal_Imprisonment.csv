aspd,ff5ohmv,t1_ff5oe0r,1579603291.0,"I am currently in a relationship. I make her really happy and she makes me really happy. I don’t want to lose her but I also have loose morals and wouldn’t hesitate to cheat on her if I knew I could get away with it

We’ve been dating for only three days so far and I haven’t felt the need to do something like cheat but it could still happen"

The only thing going for you is that it is possible he truly loves you. He may be changing his behaviour so he doesn’t lose you but I’m certain he would cheat on you if he had the opportunity to get away with it.

I can also 100% guarantee he has manipulated you and lied many times. You say he’s been honest but I question how many of those times he was honest."

sociopath,fewspfd,t3_eqqzbd,1579418917.0,I enjoy making people look like idiots. It’s pretty easy. I’m one of those people that knows a lot of random facts because I read a lot so I notice a lot of misinformation in conversation

depression,fcoc0ut,t1_fclvofb,1577828555.0,Weed can easily give you anxiety. If you wanted to ever try psychedelics you can always take a small dose
depression,fcl0wta,t1_fcl0skh,1577737406.0,The math says otherwise dude. Bill Gates would struggle to abuse acid
depression,fcl0h99,t1_fckzycx,1577737138.0,Valid opinion. I’ve never tried it but I’ve heard they are far more profound of an experience. Different visuals too and also a shorter trip might suit better for some people
depression,fcl0fh8,t1_fckz4xc,1577737108.0,"Here let’s do some maths: 

If you used LSD every day in a month. Let’s say about thirty times. Let’s say you start with one tab. Let’s say a tab is $3-$10. You would need to take 1 tab then 2, 4, 8, 16 and so on 

If you do this thirty times it would require 536,870,912 tabs to feel the effect of one dose for thirty days at a time. I don’t believe your friend tripped 40+ times in a month. 

When it comes to price this would come out to $1,610,612,736 if each tab was $3. If each tab was $10 it would be $53,687,091.20. Acid is literally financially impossible for 99% of people to abuse"
depression,fckzjr3,t1_fckz60y,1577736563.0,It isn’t legal because of propaganda and ignorance. I can’t send you some but you can just buy some off dark net markets
depression,fckytl4,t1_fckyovt,1577736113.0,"If you take three tabs one day and then three tabs the next, you will only feel half the effects. It would simply become too expensive for anybody to possibly abuse"
depression,fckyjyw,t1_fcky7pi,1577735949.0,Well LSD affects both you and the things around you. The drugs aren’t very comparable as LSD is far more intense and way different
depression,fckyi5l,t1_fckxlax,1577735920.0,LSD is very difficult to abuse though because of how much your tolerance increases and the fact that it takes two weeks to return to normal
depression,fcky30a,t1_fckxw2c,1577735662.0,LSD is stronger and it’s significantly different. A trip lasts 12-16 hours. It’s common for people to use weed before a trip because weed makes it stronger but a lot of people have more anxiety from it

lonely,fc9dee6,t3_egqw36,1577550924.0,"My only advice is to keep meeting people until you find someone who clicks. Preferably people with similar hobbies

Although, if you’re like me you’ll find it extremely difficult to have any emotional attachment and therefore greatly struggle find friends or an SO. If this is you, speak to a therapist because this is likely due to mental issues from your past"
lonely,fc9d6qr,t3_egr82e,1577550828.0,"Brutally honest you say? 

I’m diagnosed with ASPD. I don’t care about you and I will manipulate you as much as I can to get whatever I want when I want. I’ve been doing this for years and have become very good at it. I also have many other mental disorders so my behaviour is unfortunately very unpredictable however I will be soon seeking treatment to help fix my issues

Although, I like to learn languages, play games and some other cool stuff like play piano

I’m fairly introverted and don’t find anything awkward about being alongside someone without saying a word. I find it calming"

lonely,fc50v1u,t3_efsxz2,1577437345.0,"So you’re saying that being more social made you more confident? Some of the people on this sub should take this advice 

Kinda annoys me how many people complain about confidence and social skills when they can just start being social. They can all be like “That’s not how it works” but it is. 

I used to be so socially awkward, I couldn’t speak to anybody new at any time. I decided I was tired of being so painfully awkward so I forced myself to be social. A year later, I’m extremely confident and can do just fine in social situations"

aspd,fc4l1da,t3_eg5yd5,1577419791.0,"ASPD helps me in my career and I can be whoever I want in any relationship. This makes advancing much easier 

However, with my SO I’d rather be who I truly was all the time. 

Regarding psychedelics, I’d say I definitely feel more normal. I get very emotional from LSD.

Also, there is a high correlation between people who have ASPD, also having NPD which makes sense"

ForeverAlone,fag22kl,t3_e8ngqc,1576037907.0,"Weed and LSD are great. Weed is more for fun but psychedelics in general can be a great treatment for depression and anxiety. They’re not bad for you either but there are risks of having a bad trip which is usually avoidable if you’re responsible, however I always find bad trips to have positive outcomes because it puts me out of my comfort zone.

I recommend trying out LSD once."
