Ok"

Agreeing with someone saying that killing animals for food is unethical and pointing out that animals are killed no matter what you eat. Tell me, did you not read the comment of the person I replied to? Are smaller animals routinely killed for food where you're from? Help me understand where the confusion could lie.

Also, you're welcome bud. I just wanted you to understand that unlike you, sometimes people *don't* mean exactly what they said. This is just me mocking your holier than thou comments btw, since you apparently have the reading comprehension skills of a first grader. It doesn't escape my attention that you seem to think the ""point"" I was referring to was my use of the word ""farm."""

Some retard misunderstood my comment and then tried to act like they said something clever, and then still has the gall to act like the mistake was mine.

Here's something else that you might not understand, what with you being a moron. Unlike *you*, I didn't mean exactly what I said. I wasn't actually asking if you were dropped on your head. I was just calling you stupid."

GamePhysics,fdj3319,t1_fdj23fx,1578457158.0,"Of course the combat is similar to origins. It's a sequel. The arkham series used the exact same combat for 4 games and that's what made them popular.

The story is pretty okay, but it's the characters that carry it. The leap of faith wasn't conceived at the moment the hidden ones were formed. It existed for hundreds of years before that, and for all I know the medjay could have picked up the practice from someone else.

The games are more successful now than they've ever been, and it's for a good reason. The formula that they were using reached its peak in brotherhood and then stagnated until 4 was released. Personally I'm looking forward to the new viking one that's being released this year, since the main draw has never been the modern day story. They could get rid of those sections entirely and the game itself would be unaffected."

GamePhysics,fdj3319,t1_fdj23fx,1578457158.0,"Of course the combat is similar to origins. It's a sequel. The arkham series used the exact same combat for 4 games and that's what made them popular.

The story is pretty okay, but it's the characters that carry it. The leap of faith wasn't conceived at the moment the hidden ones were formed. It existed for hundreds of years before that, and for all I know the medjay could have picked up the practice from someone else.

The games are more successful now than they've ever been, and it's for a good reason. The formula that they were using reached its peak in brotherhood and then stagnated until 4 was released. Personally I'm looking forward to the new viking one that's being released this year, since the main draw has never been the modern day story. They could get rid of those sections entirely and the game itself would be unaffected."

AskReddit,fdgq74v,t1_fdf4re3,1578405428.0,"The idea of a draft is that you have a limited amount of time to turn someone into a soldier. A woman can train to be exceptionally well conditioned, and would still only be around as fast and strong as an average Male. There's also a much higher chance of her injuring herself in the process."

It's got nothing to do with ""allowing it into circulation."" Regardless, the penis and the testicles are separate organs. Getting punched in the dick doesn't hurt very much since it's mostly a mass of tissue with few nerves, so yes I'd argue that you could remain standing after serious injury to it. Punch yourself in the balls right now and see if you don't immediately bend over. It's a biological response to shield them from further harm. It's not complicated."
natureismetal,fdfbb0q,t1_fdezms4,1578357656.0,"They didn't actually get kicked in the balls properly then, I'd imagine. It's a biological response. Unless you're out there getting kicked in the balls repeatedly to train the response, you're going down."

There's a reason that going into high ranks naked gets turned into youtube series. Once the devs add the naked mode they promised, I'll give the game another shot. Until then, no I would not like to have my ass handed to me by SWFs after waiting 5 minutes for a game."

deadbydaylight,fdeiebh,t1_fdebi5n,1578339682.0,Way too quickly in respect to what? It takes a hundred hours to get a single killer with viable perks. The grind is garbage and is the main reason I stopped playing after I got trapper with the teachables I wanted on him. The thought of having to do that shit again on another killer made me want to puke.
natureismetal,fdegfb2,t1_fdef6ya,1578338471.0,Maybe they have a similar response as humans? No amount of adrenaline is gonna keep you standing if you get shwacked in the balls.
