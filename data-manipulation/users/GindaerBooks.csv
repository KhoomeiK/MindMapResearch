One of my biggest problems is that I often think time is wasted on a hobby, which contradicts my first statement of finding a hobby..."

books,fctq3r6,t3_eiom8r,1577953730.0,"I've noticed that it is with everything in life. If you force a goal upon yourself instead of sustaining it long-term and forming a habbit, it will fail down the road.

Personally, for the past 2 years, I've made a habit of reading before bed, even if it's one page. In the two years time period applying this habit, I've read 53 books. 

Don't force yourself, enjoy it! I'm also debating on getting Kindle, does anyone know if it is worth it, does it pay off? Cheers!"
