First of all, zombies are in mythology and popular culture. And if a zombie was spotted in real life, you would be damn sure someone in authority would kill it somewhere and hide evidence that it ever happened to not cause a public panic.

If we’re assuming the stereotypical zombie will happen, they move slow, are dumb, very clumsy, and can be killed easily (all you have to do is destroy their brains, which could be done in a variety of ways). ALSO, since they’re dead, their bodies will be affected by rigor mortis, which means that they will be susceptible to decaying over a short period of time, but especially during the day since the suns heat will make them decay faster.

Since they’re dumb, people will just have to lock themselves in their houses for a few days and wait for them to rot. Zombies probably can’t figure out how to unlock a door, or will literally lose limbs in the process (due to rigor mortis).

I’m assuming this post is coming from the recent outbreak of coronavirus in China. Everyone who died from that was over the age of 60. This is common in a lot of outbreaks because your immune system worsens as you age, which is why elderly people have so many medical issues that younger people don’t have. The younger people who have the virus, while in the hospital, are all reported to be in good health, so as long as you’re taking care of yourself and avoiding people who are sick I think you’ll be okay :)"
