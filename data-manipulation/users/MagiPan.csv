* Get a good paying job to afford house
* Have lots of kids and send them to good public schools
* Be a happy family
* Have ""date days"" were each child gets a special day besides their birthday, where it's just me and him/her and we get to have a nice day hanging out. It could be a movie night or going to the zoo, whatever they want.

In your case, it sounds like parents might be abusing the system, but we don't know the full story. 

>at almost any job I've had, married people with kids get priority over everyone else.

I don't really get the married people. But I do understand the employees with kids. Because it's a child. A child can't care for itself, and childcare is immensely expensive. Most people with good stable jobs (middle class for example) couldn't afford constant childcare outside of school (not saying schools are childcare). Childcare isn't really that affordable anymore. 

Children get sick, or there might be an emergency call to the principle's office, and mandatory parent teacher meetings (some schools make it a student grade, so if the parents don't come, the student gets an F as a test grade and lowers their class grade). Even with childcare, if the kid gets sick, it has to go home. Sick kids (fevers or flu for example) aren't allowed at daycares. 

So of course it would get priority over you hanging out with friends. Because you having a fun night out with friends isn't necessary, caring for a child mandatory unless you want CPS involved. 


>taking extra work on, changing my schedule, or 

Idk what your job is, but that really shouldn't be happening. Unless you work at Target or something, but then that is a management problem. 

>stupid married people with kids use every excuse under the sun to leave early, show up late or take last-minute time off

Having a child does that. The parents need to be there for doctor appointments, school plays and games to support their child and so that their child doesn't think Daddy/Mommy is too busy for them and grow up thinking daddy or mommy hates them or doesn't have time for them. They have to go to parent-teacher meetings to make sure that their child is doing well in academics and is safe at school, someone needs to feed them, and make sure they get home safe after school ends. 

Unless it's an actual terrible excuse like ""Boss I am going home because little Johnny misses me because my husband forgot to cut his apples into hearts, he is throwing a tantrum."" That's a horrible excuse to leave work. 


>if they can't handle their family responsibilities, it's not my fucking problem

Again, children are a wild card. Anything can happen at any time. 


>complaining about how tired they are

Everyone's bodies are different. Each person has a different level of tired they can handle. Imagine how tired parents of a newborn are. They are sleeping 3 to 4 hours a night trying to get their baby to sleep. Or their toddler doesn't want to sleep in their own bed and gets up at all hours of the night to bother the parents. Kids are kids.


To me it sounds like the people are taking advantage of you, and giving you extra work because they don't complete it. I have never met a parent who does this. If they miss work time because of their kids, they almost always make it up. Because they need that money. They have kids to feed. 

Demand that you either be financially compensated for the extra work/hours or you wont do the work. It's not your work to complete. But don't hate on people with children because they have a child to tend to."

Granted, not everyone is mature, not saying I myself am mature either, but there should be circumstances where teens should vote.

Business degrees are easy but it's mostly theory. None of the stuff you will learn will make sense until you start working. Even then, most of your coworkers won't remember anything. 

I've talked with a lot of business majors of all kinds, almost all of them say getting a PHD is useless and overkill unless you want to be a professor and teach business in college or if you really want a PHD. 

A Bachelor's is all you need, and a Master's is excellent. 


In my biased opinion: Business is common sense. Dads need diapers, and you need to sell more beer? Put the diapers right next to the beer and you'll sell more beers (common example used in many classes).

SpaceForce,ff2fneg,t3_ef72q4,1579504120.0,"I like it, I especially love the insignia. For me it's a bit too close to the Coast Guard uniform in terms of design.
