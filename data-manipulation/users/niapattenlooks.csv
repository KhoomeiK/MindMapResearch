AttachmentParenting,feklstf,t3_epn438,1579202713.0,"I don’t know if I can help but just wanted to show solidarity. I’m on my third sleep averse baby now (who needs sleep anyway?). My second baby was incredibly demanding. I get how annoying it is when people try and give advice. I had one friend asked if I had tried putting lavender oil on her feet, like of course that’s why she screams from 2am to 6am every night, it’s the lack of lavender on her feet!!! I had a sleep specialist come to my house in desperation. She asked a load of questions and her conclusion was that I was doing great and all I had to do was just try and survive. No advice but just pat yourself on the back for being an amazing mum and you’re not alone"
