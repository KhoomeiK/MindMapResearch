unpopularopinion,fgmw68y,t3_ez9yt7,1580933186.0,"Hot take: You're correct, but it's got nothing to do with women.        

Full disclosure: I am a woman.      
I think my family care about me. Some of my friends. I don't feel like anyone apart from that really gives the slightest shit that I exist, how I feel, whether I live or die.         

I mean, yeah, the 'role/perspective/visibility of women' is talked about as important. And I think thats good. But they don't mean *me*. It's an abstracted idea of 'women'.    
It's like how in the past when people use to say ""The progression of man..."" ""The work of great men..."" as shorthand for 'what humankind as a whole is up to'. They weren't talking about you, or your friend, or a homeless person, they've never mattered - they meant people in an abstract sense. The only difference is that now people point out that was cutting out half the population. The difference now is that theoretically the other half of the population can join in the 'humanity can be awesome!' bit. Men can walk on the moon! You know what, women can walk on the moon as well! 

I was born, I go to work and walk past people in the shops, and then one day I will die. I'm lucky in that I've had a few people in my life who care about me, like my parents and my husband. But apart from that, no one will even notice or give the slightest shit about my thoughts or feelings.        
I can have some kids, or look pretty, or whatever - society will still find a way to have a problem with however I do it.          
No amount of girl-power-slogan-trying-to-sell-me-shit headlines and billboards will change that.       

The thing is, and why this is increasingly worse, is that inequality is growing more in recent years. My role in this world is to be quiet and work my bit so that other people can make some money and get some more power. Not because I'm a woman, or you're a man, but because we don't matter. Homeless people don't matter not because they're men, but because they're not beneficial in getting more wealth and power for others. We've been trained out of basic human compassion - whether its calling someone a slut, ignoring a homeless man on the street, generally stepping over each other - because its not beneficial to anyone but us, and no one cares about us.       

I'm not going to agree with 'so basically we should cancel feminism because its a division!' because to be honest systemic sexism (and gender roles that hurt men as well ie. mental health outreach difficulties) is still a thing as well, and I'm not into lying. I honestly don't want to wind up people who are pointing the finger in the wrong place, but I also don't want to placate them by denying a problem that exists. But I'm hopeful that eventually people will see that the gnawing feeling that society cares about something, but it sure as hell isn't us or 99% of the people we walk past each day, isn't a problem of dividing our compassion pie 'too far in the other direction' - its a problem with ignoring that the compassion pie is getting surreptitiously smaller."
PurplePillDebate,fgmq2uz,t3_ezauwc,1580929748.0,"Anything to do with the idea of ""Mr Right"" really, though that could be 'Mrs Right"" in a gender flipped version, so it's not just about women.       

I absolutely don't mean 'put up with someone you don't really love just because they're there' or 'settle'.    

I mean the problem with Mr Right is that women (and men) will then date with a version of who that person is in their head, looking for that person. Like ""They've got to be into x"" ""They've got to say y to me"" ""They've got to look like z"". Then they find that person doesn't exist, or is very far away/taken, or if they do they don't like you back. Or even they find them and actually you're not that into it.       

Sometimes the people/person you meet who you can actually make a good and happy go of it with isn't someone you'd have expected - and that isn't settling. It's not about entitlement or 'under/overestimating your value', it's about the fact that people are complex, and life is complex.         
While it's OK to have some really important 'deal breakers' to do with values and red flags, it's silly to have more shallow (I don't means looks necessarily, I mean in terms of real impact as a person) less important ones that sabotage what could have been a really beautiful thing. And I don't mean ""Keep on with people you're not attracted to"", I mean ""Don't ignore gut feelings of someone you could be attracted to because they're not what you expect"".                     

Like, maybe you had in your head a sort of sarcastic nerdy artistic indie type. And you chase guys you meet based on how closely they fit the model. But then you meet a guy who doesn't seem on the face of it like that at all, but you love how passionate he is even if its about something you'd never dreamed 'your guy' would be passionate about, and maybe he wears 'jock' stuff instead of 'cool nerd shit', and is more positive than sarcastic. Or you imagined very specific kinds of gestures/phrases to show love, but this guy communicates differently. If you just immediately nope him out (even subconsciously) because he doesn't fit the bill, ignoring that gut feeling of 'being around this guy makes me happy', you're sabotaging your happiness based on someone who you made up - or even worse sticking with someone who makes you unhappy because they fit a picture. And thats silly.    


Basically any kind of dating that is based around removed 'weighing up' people, or winning the game, looking for imagined third party validation -  rather than authentic human interaction/exploring new kinds of attraction through a lens of self respect, and having fun. You might get hurt sometimes when you're vulnerable like that, but it's the kind of hurt that won't regret on your death bed.        
It's partly why I dislike the red pill so much. I'm old and experienced enough to have seen people of all genders and sexualities destroy their own chances at happiness with that kind of rigid 'external' thinking, and its frustratingly pointless.           

Edit: Can I just add - Tinder *really* doesn't help with this shit. I'm so glad sometimes I met my husband like... basically a week before Tinder became the expected dating method for all single people. You can absolutely still use dating apps and not develop that mentality, but it definitely makes it easier to slip into it."
unpopularopinion,fgmc7gb,t1_fglo27d,1580921792.0,"Yeah I think for the most part the ""Karen"" customers interactions are the ones where the customer specifically acted like the establishment was some homogenous being which has wronged them, and the only way to get out of being clearly *victimised* by not getting what they want is to be a dick to bottom rung employees making minimum wage.    

I've worked in retail a bit back in the day, and there is definitely a difference between that and just 'customer with a problem'. Like, if a customer says ""Hi so I have a problem with x/y/z and I'd like to sort it out, can you check a/b/c or if not get someone who deals with that kind of issue for me to speak to?"" - that happened, and I have absolutely no problem with it. Its my job to sort shit out for customers, and I'm getting paid the same for me time whether I'm standing scanning shit or I'm walking down to the storage room/office - absolutely fine with doing that, to be honest kind of glad to have an excuse to do something slightly different for a few minutes. Or even if its ""Hi, I think there is an error in my bill here, could you take a look?"" when its you that has made a mistake - I'll happily apologise and sort that out for them.            
The important difference is that person has treated you like an equal human being doing a job, and just politely asked if you could do a part of that job for them. Rather than talking to you like you're a piece of shit, being outraged that you might be an actual human being who could make a mistake, etc.        

I remember when I was in retail there was one woman who came in all the time and was *the worst*. Always spoke to us like we were pieces of shit. Became indignant whenever anything didn't go her way.      
She also had a thing where she would lazy park her giant expensive car on the street outside (this was on a high street, no car park) blocking people and causing huge issue. And she'd always ask us to carry her bags out there for her (this was not standard part of the service - we used to offer happily for older people getting a cab or those who were obviously struggling for whatever reason, and maybe she saw that one time, but I mean technically if we do it for one customer we shouldn't refuse another, so we used to just do it).       
This one time she asked me to do that when I was having a particularly bad day, and she particularly spoke to my younger colleague like she'd scraped her off her shoe -all while deciding she'd changed her mind about multiple items and sending me running to fetch things for her. (Honestly I think a lot of it was just *because she could*, like her husband fucked around and she was enacting her rage on minimum wage shop girls, or something).She opened her car boot and there was already a small Channel shopping bag in there, of the size that will have sunglasses/make-up/jewellery in it, and then as normal went to start getting in her car without saying a word.       

I dropped those bags of food (hard fruit and bottles included) from a significant height right on top of her new bangles/lipstick/whatever - maybe its just wishful thinking but I'm pretty sure I heard a crunch. Shut the boot and went back in. Zero regret.        

I'll fetch things for customers. I'll sort out problems for customers. I'll pack and carry bags for customers. No problem. But you treat me/the 16 year old girl next to me like we're worthless, and you better believe I'ma purposefully fuck up your sunglasses and pretend its an accident every chance I get, Karen."
niceguys,fgm86bk,t1_fglja23,1580919766.0,">It's like being jealous that Charles Manson had a girlfriend.       

I've come across some many people that *are* jealous of Manson (and Bundy, and others) ""But they had *loads* of women, and they were awful, and I don't even have one LIFE ISN'T FAIR"".       

Yeah, manipulative psychopath cult leading serial killers will often 'have' (and kill) multiple women before they get caught. Yeah, its not a great example of the world being just and fair - well done on noticing that.       
But the most important injustice there is clearly the non murderers who are missing out on the sex with the victims because they're too busy being abused or murder victims.         

It's like those PUA/'red pill' guys who are into the 'dark triad' which is essentially a description of sociopathy.

notliketheothergirls,fgj0g49,t1_fgia5mc,1580834620.0,"I'm guessing Brian Cox stuff or whatever the US equivalent of that is. Something like A Brief History of Time, Carlo Rovelli, etc. Popular science books aimed at the ""lay"" or general population for casual enjoyment.       
Those are the only 'books on physics' I can think of where the majority isn't diagrams and maths that therefore would make no sense as an audiobook.        

Which - absolutely no shade. Those books can be interesting, and it's great that people want to spend some of their free time finding out more about the universe and how things work. I'm kind of biased as a school physics teacher, but I think that physics is and should be for *everyone*, be for enrichment, not just people who are in/going into STEM jobs or 'good at that kind of stuff'. The idea that you need to be a super educated mathematical whizz who flew through high school to get something out of understanding physics is just bullshit peddled by STEM-lord types who care more about their fragile giant ego than their subject.                  

But it's silly to somehow use reading them as bragging rights when they whole point is that they're *specifically written in such a way to be accessible to everyone*, or as many people as possible. All you really need to enjoy them is an interest (and they're written to be interesting above all) and a very basic understanding of lower school level science/maths - thats the selling point.     
To be clear, they're not aimed at 'stupid people who have to read these because they can't do real physics' either - just anyone who wants a casual snapshot of whatever the area is.

(I've worked in the past in various ways with adult's and children with learning disabilities - what 'mental handicap' is called in the UK.)     

But it's worth remembering that people with learning disabilities are just..... people, who have learning disabilities. So they can bring wonder, joy, laughter. Including people with multiple and profound disabilities. But they can also be mean, and lie, and be selfish or hurtful. Because they're full complex human beings, and like all other full complex human beings, there is good and bad.   
And that is great - we can look at them as what they are - people.                

One time as part of a place I worked, we took a group of kids to a theme park on a trip. Was generally loads of fun. Then, at the end of the day we were having massive issue with one girl with Downs Syndrome - and I was trying to deal with her while the others got on the coach with the other workers.     
And at one point this lady walked past, and said to me ""Aw, she is so cute isn't she!"" and ""Hi!"" to her. It was lovely in the sense that the lady was being positive to and about someone who is often seen as a negative thing in the world. Also I think she might of thought I was her mother, and I know that there is a thing where parents of kids with Downs will say how it hurts how other people get told their kids are cute where they just get silence.      

I remember thinking ""Yeah, she can be really cute and awesome, I really like her, and I appreciate what you're doing. But right now she is being a little dickhead, as you will know teenagers are occasionally wont. Also GET ON THE BUS RIGHT THIS SECOND, CLAIRE.""             

Also the things that go round the internet of stories about sporting events where people with learning disabilities competed but mainly just to help each other out, seeing it as a collaborative thing rather than a race. They always make me laugh because its not my experience - I've been to sporting competitions for people with learning disabilities, and they were lovely and had fun, but make no mistake - they were trying to fucking win just as much as anyone competing would be."
unpopularopinion,fgecun4,t1_fge7fhg,1580696636.0,"> You should never believe anyone about such a serious allegation unless there's proof and definitely shouldn't put it out in the media. That's what I'm saying. So you agree?     

I think MeToo was important in terms of raising awareness. But I think generally sharing too much on social media in general is a recipe for disaster. Plus you can share your story without naming and shaming.          

Also I think in theory everything you're saying is pretty standard - go to the police, tell them everything, etc. But both the police and the way we talk about people, we should treat them like actual people who have just had something fucking awful happen to them, and not like clinically detached automatons.     

Whats going through someone's head when they disclose something - either to people they know or to the police - isn't normally ""I want super sympathy and attention, everyone sympathy and attention me"" or ""I can't be bothered with a full statement I have a manicure at 6"" or ""How can I dob this fucker in good and hard?"". Its ""Oh god, everyone will think I'm lying, what if everyone thinks I'm lying?"" ""What if they think I'm stupid and I'm over-reacting?"" ""Should I even do this? I don't want this to happen but I don't want to *ruin someone's life*, I don't want to be responsible for that..."" ""What if this just makes everything worse?"". Holding back information might be ""because I said something nice to him, does that mean I led him on? they're going to say I led him on, aren't they?....."".     

I think that considered, there is a lot of reason to support people. If your intention is stopping crime, then you want victims to be able to come forward and not be put off by being made to feel like a criminal.       

It doesn't take a lot, or compromise an investigation, to make people feel less like utter shit and further traumatised. People deal with horrific shit happening to them differently, its just about having a bit of compassion beyond ""Well I said that sucks and that I'm sure the police will be nice to you, you're on your own now""."
unpopularopinion,fge6i2z,t1_fge5nuc,1580692482.0,"No. I was talking about when a person discloses to a non-police officer. That is who ""believe the victim"" is about primarily as a social media thing.    

There has been a problem with 'Are you SURE SURE SURE this happened? Let me really obviously try and catch you out...' police interviews to victims, but I think mostly they're getting better at that.      
Police officers should really do what you say - take a statement (though in a supportive way and compassionate way that doesn't make the person feel like a criminal themselves). Then investigate based on the evidence. Of course.      

Wait, do people think that this is about the police 'believing victims' in the sense of then just assuming alleged perpetrators are lying when they ask them, and not collecting evidence? God no. It absolutely does not in any respect mean that.

unpopularopinion,fgaluk5,t1_fg9gwqq,1580652771.0,">The #believeallwomen idea was and always will be stupid. People lie, whatever they have between their legs        

The idea behind 'believing women' is that previously when someone has shared an account of abuse in say the workplace, the immediate reaction is often 'But what evidence do you have right now to prove to me you're not lying?'.     
It's worth making a point that in most places the hashtag wasn't 'Believe women' it was 'Believe the victim'.     
This frequently stops people coming forward (better to just put up with abuse than be abused and called a liar as well), and therefore means that the situation just continues.        

While:     
1) For the most part, people don't just make up that they're being sexually harassed/assaulted or abused. Some people do, but the vast majority of the time... why would you go through all that, and quite possibly lose your job/lose friends/be seen as 'damaged' if there was no reason to?       
2) We don't normally immediately question if someone is lying when they tell us something. If someone tells us they had their car broken into over the weekend, we don't normally ask for photographic evidence of the break in and evidence that they didn't break into their own car. We just say ""Man, that sucks"".         
3) Yeah, it s more awkward because if someone reports a break in, we assume that could have been any random stranger out of thousands of random strangers in the area that day, but when someone reports abuse harassment by their partner/boss/etc., they generally have only one boss/partner, so 'an accused' pops up immediately. *However*, does that necessarily mean we should believe something awful happened to them less?         

The point isn't that we should believe women (who are starting to more frequently actually report these situations with MeToo) because women are special creatures who don't lie, the point is that we shouldn't immediately question whether someone is a liar when they tell us they have been the victim of something. Aka we should 'believe them'.     

They might be lying, yeah. Partner/boss/whoever might have done nothing wrong, if they deny whatever it is happened. But *that* is when evidence and going through accounts of what happened to check validity, as carried out by a court of law or a HR department or whatever, comes into play.     
If there is a discrepancy of accounts and action needs to be taken, of course then it's all about evidence and checking who is telling the truth. But that doesn't happen at the point when your friend/relative/whatever is telling you that they were the victim or something, so why do we immediately start to question them as a liar the moment they tell? Which people do, hence 'believe the victim' as a general social message.        

While you aren't necessarily on topic, its worth saying that in this case, the issue doesn't seem to be that Heard lied about being assaulted and abused by Depp. IIRC he kind of half denied it and then didn't, and quite possibly thats because what she claimed happened, happened.         
So the issue wasn't believing Heard was abused. It is just possible that Depp was *also* abused and assaulted by Heard.          
if this is the case I'm not excusing Heard for not telling the whole story - not at all, it does indeed put Depp's actions in something of a different light (though it *also* doesn't mean his actions were purely retaliatory either). I just mean that we can't say ""Amber Heard lied when she said that Johnny Depp abused her and beat her up"" if Johnny Depp did indeed abuse her a beat her up.     

**Edit to be clear why I'm posting this:**
I don't deny a problem with men feeling they can't report assault/abuse (we still have this idea that 'being a victim' makes you weak, and its far harder to make it clear its OK when toxic masculinity 'never look weak or you're less of a man' comes into play').      
I just over and over see 'believe the victim' put as if it somehow means 'evidence doesn't matter' or 'women are perfect beings who never lie, only sexists would consider that women are capable of lies', and it means nothing of the sort."

Because if you think about it, you can stand on one of the poles, and it have no noticeable difference on your weight than if you're standing on the equator. The force of weight as a result of gravity is pretty much constant wherever you are on the planet's surface.       

The speed (scalar quantity, just magnitude) we're moving is constant, it's just the direction that changes due to the force of weight. That force due to gravity is going to be there whether the earth is rotating or not. The actual balanced forces acting on us (weight and the reactive force of the earth pushing back) would still be the only actual forces acting on us. We'd just be bodies at rest, instead of moving at a constant speed (scalar) with that constantly changing direction."

*Technically* while the rate of rotation of the earth is constant, an object on the surface of the earth which is undergoing centripetal force (like us) *is* accelerating. Because acceleration is a vector quantity (has both magnitude and direction), and the direction of our velocity (so our path of inertia, if no force were being applied) changes as the earth rotates. We are technically accelerating in the direction of the force applied on us - so towards the centre of the earth.         

Apologies for the science teacher pedantry because I can see what you mean, but unless you consider it like this you can start to get confused when you consider Newton's second law (Why don't we just keep moving in the same direction and fly off into space because that would be inertia?

I've never had a guy cheat with me (to my knowledge), but I imagine the whole 'feeling bad for his girlfriend and also that it means he is a kind of scummy person' would outweigh any feeling it was rewarding because I'd made his eye wander.        

>Is this something you think many women consider when meeting a attractive guy but partnered?           

I don't know. I don't think so, at least consciously? But I suppose women aren't going to make it clear to their female friends and acquaintances that they're into stealing boyfriends, because thats how you end up with no friends, so....

>Do you ever worry that your man will run into a woman like that when he's out without you or with a girl-friend?        

No. I trust him. He is someone who prioritises truth and openness a lot, so normally when he thinks someone was hitting on him he will straight up just mention it next time he sees me.      
Like, I'm not going to pretend I would never ever get jealous or am as sure he would never do that as I am that if I throw an object its going to fall to the ground. But we trust each other, so it's not something I worry about.       

As other people are saying it's the classic 'if he cheats with you, he'll cheat on you'. Even if no technical cheating took place. So if you say that is how you met, your female friends are more likely to view him with suspicion than 'he must be quite a catch, well done'.      

I knew this guy, Rob (all names changed), who was a friend of a friend (female friend who never had anything romantic/sexual with him). Rob had a long term girlfriend, Claire.      
Not long after he entered my social circle, he another friend Gemma start hanging out, and he leaves Claire to be with Gemma. They're together a lot, move in pretty quickly. Gemma is of the opinion and impression that this is probably a lifelong thing now - he'd implied to her that when they'd met they'd just clicked in a way that was so total that of course he was going to leave Claire and be together all the time.           
Eventually, after a year or two of being together the majority of which they'd lived together, Rob meets another girl. Leaves Gemma for the other girl in exactly the same way he'd left Claire for Gemma.     
Basically I get the impression Rob is a serial monogamist who doesn't like being alone and really likes the day to day having of a girlfriend, so it doesn't even occur to him that he would break up with a girl unless there is another girl he likes better, but then he sees it as an 'of course' that he would do that if he meets a girl he likes better. Rob isn't the only Rob that I have encountered in my life, though I've never been with one myself.            

Rob is by no means a stud, very normal looking and not particularly interesting. Could be, but likely not, irrelevant that each girl from Claire to Gemma to new girl got more conventionally attractive, though probably none of them would be 'rated' highly on here.    

Its always funny that for all the talk about women's hypergamic (?) branch swinging on here, I've never noticed the phenomenon in real life. But I've known a couple of guys like Rob who are basically fucking Tarzan."

There is no 'anti-man bias'. The problem here is clear as day is anti-woman sentiments. Because however much MGTOW claims to be about men manning in their man-ness, every time I've gone on there the 90% of the top threads have been about women.

School policies differ, though.      

I've worked in schools where if a child's attendance falls below a certain point (95% normally, increasing measures for under 90 and then under 85), they will ask for medical evidence for every day/every other day, or a higher grade of evidence, even if they days are not consecutive. Plus they will generally meet with parents, send round attendance officers/ESW, etc. in order to develop 'a plan' to get them in more. Like ""I had flu"" might be enough for a couple of days, but if that kid gets flu all the time it's like ""Why does this child keep getting flu? Do we have evidence that they are receiving more than just primary intervention for this apparent repeated flu having? Do they really have flu? What evidence do we have that they really have flu? We shall set up a flu-absence-prevention-plan with the parents in order to reduce absence.""          

Like that you stated is the basic UK policy and might be the only one actioned at your school, but at a lot of schools similar to what OP is saying kicks in after overall attendance drops lower than the mid 90s. (Especially academies where even more of their funding is dependent on keeping absence rates down.)        

I teach now, and so I don't have much to do with it anymore, but I used to work solely on the pastoral side and you'd be surprised how much pressure is put on attendance officers and the like by the SLT to make sure in turn every pressure possible is applied to families over persistently absent kids.

Someone could have just reached in and taken her stuff out there in front of them."
AskFeminists,ffxgi38,t3_evodnw,1580324675.0,"Some great responses already here, but just to add:     

I think that people have an huge issue with the idea of 'privilege' applying to themselves in general. Both in terms of the word being used as a part of an intersectional feminist lens, but also without the word privilege actually being used (basically what you're talking about - men feeling implicated by talk about the patriarchy).       
It comes up *constantly*. I've seen so so many times people saying things like ""They should change the word because that is insulting to me and will turn people off."" etc.       

I think the reason is that our society tends to break down 'things that we get in life' into three simplistic and discrete categories:     
1) Things that we deserve because we worked hard or were a good person or whatever.      
2) Things that just happened because of pure good or bad luck.       
3) Things that we took from others by being deceitful or cruel or something.      

So people see the rational like:           
- I thought I have the things that I have behave I'm a hard worker and a good person. I certainly remember working hard and trying to be a good person.         
- But other people can work hard and be a good person and not get those things?  
- So you are implying that is not why I have them.             
- So you're saying I'm not a good person and I don't work hard? Or that I took those things from other people?            
- Fuck off I was there, you're obviously just bitter and full of guilt.              

But of course, reality isn't that simple - thinking about what people 'deserve' in these terms isn't really that productive, though also really hard to break away from. Because our whole egos and identities are built around it to some level.         

Because the previous understanding of 'privilege is'      
- People who were born with a silver spoon in their mouth, don't know pain and suffering, never had to work hard.      
- People who 'deserve' what they have, who have had to fight things in life.      

Either as a discrete dichotomy or a uni-dimensional sliding scale. But again, it's much more complicated than that. People who have certain privileges can still be hard workers who need to strive for things. People who have certain privileges can still suffer - people who have certain privileges can sometimes suffer *more* than those who don't in unrelated ways. But hard work and suffering don't negate privilege, and they don't mean that 'privilege' isn't still the best descriptive word for what it is.        


Basically becoming aware of certain societal oppressions as someone who has not been the victim of those oppressions can seem at odds with what we (all, of all different privileges and oppressions, its just our culture) tend to understand in terms of 'deservedness' and 'good vs bad people'. So it's easy to misinterpret the new information as an attack along those lines with which you're already familiar, rather than considering it as a new framework that questions our normal understanding of those things altogether."
unpopularopinion,ffxakkq,t3_evojzg,1580321192.0,"This is the most popular unpopular opinion ever that people are apparently obsessed with, as other are saying.    

But also (since I couldn't be bothered to post last few times it came up):      

1)     
>i don't think we should be marvelling people of bad health to continue to do so for the sake of confidence, pride, or other mental health concerns.     

Less mental health conditions is a good thing though, right?    
Like, lets realistically assume the person isn't fat because they're trying to be fat, and likely if they had a button to press 'be fat or not' they'd choose 'not'. Vast vast majority of the time, they've also attempted not to be fat previously at least a few times.       
So is it better they be fat *with* an additional mental health condition or *without* an additional mental health condition?    
Personally I'd say the latter is the least unhealthy, if we're worried about health.         

2)      
>excessively overweight or underweight individuals is to be encouraging regular exercise and for those people to eat as healthy a diet as they can afford     

I mean, yeah, regular exercise and a healthy diet should be encouraged - particularly in terms of education, economic allocation to lowering prices, etc. Great.        
But you can do that without saying ""fat people aren't beautiful we shouldn't say they're beautiful"".         

3)        
>or that other unhealthy habits (smoking, excessive drinking etc) shouldn’t be put down in the media     

Being fat isn't a habit, though. Its a body type. It may have habits *associated* with it, but you're essentially putting a person's whole aesthetic, sexual and social being into a description as 'a habit'.     
A comparable habit actually related might be say binge eating. There is a difference between 'glamourising binge eating as a thing people do' and 'glamourising fat people be allowing fat people to be considered of equally valid appearance'.          

4)       
The majority of the time, telling fat people they're ugly/unattractive/unsexy doesn't lead to them losing weight. Shame is a fucking awful motivational tool. People who feel bad about themselves will find it much harder to motivate themselves to change thought patterns and behaviours than people who feel good about themselves.    

Yeah, there are some people who were overweight and then someone was like ""You look really ugly"" and that motivated them to lose the weight. It happens. But the majority of the time it goes the other way.    

Making people feel better about themselves (when they probably already feel bad because society in general says 'fat people are ugly') on the other hand, is a really great motivational tool. And even if they don't get enough motivation from that, they feel happier - and thats nice, right?         

**TLDR**;    
Fat shaming condones bad health and should be stopped."

It's far easier to pickpocket a backpack than it is a purse. I own a really nice backpack (like, soft mustard leather - seriously I love it), and every time I wear it out and end up on a bus/train/elevator/escalator or in a queue/busy place I end up slinging it round to my side because it would be so easy for someone to stick their hand in without me noticing otherwise.              
You could get one of those little backpack padlocks, but then your bag is super inaccessible when you need something from it.

As a European:     

That isn't the stereotype of American women - thats the stereotype of Americans in general.      

In fact, the majority of the time when someone is doing an impression or skit of a 'loud, obnoxious, ask for the manager and big themselves up American"", it's an American man they're pretending to be.     

Not hating - half the 'snooty and quietly up themselves' UK/european stereotypes are at least equally as based on reality in the other direction.           
But surely 'brash, loud, individualistic and proud' is just (comparative to the rest of the world) the american culture and communication style? So it seems a bit weird to single out american women being like that as 'problematic' in some way.         

>My SO's culture is not western at all, she is not a feminist but she's a hard worker and has a university degree. But nothing would please her more than to have and serve a family.     

I'm a feminist partially because I have this kind of ethos.    
I could never be with a man who didn't serve our family as his absolute priority, or with a man who considered having professional qualifications/career/status as making him 'above' any of the ways in which he could serve our family.      
It's something I noticed in a lot of men growing up, particularly in my fathers generation, and ever since I was a kid it annoyed me that it seemed/seems culturally to go unquestioned. Both in terms of seeing themselves as 'above' certain aspects of supporting their families, or seeing their families as something to provide them with status/importance/progeny/warm fuzzies in the evening rather than something they should be dedicated to serving and improving in a real way.       
Not *all* men, not even of that generation (my dad was never like that himself). But the way that people just seemed to accept it as OK for men exclusively seemed weird to me.        

If I'm going to have a family, I want to be assured that my partner has the same value system as me. If he doesn't think its important to say know the name of our kid's class teacher/friends, or check if he needs to do something so we have food in, or keep up our relationships with our community, or keep track of our kid's immunisations - I'm going to question whether he finds those things generally unimportant and/or if he believes that he is 'above' serving our family and/or thinks other things should take priority over our family. I shouldn't have to *tell him* to do those things, if that is his value system - if we decide to have a family we should *both* serve our family.      

A couple of my friends and I have a thing where we'll occasionally share stories that have frustrated us along these lines, to get the frustration out in a way that doesn't impact on our lives. Like, women we've worked with who will make sure *all* the savings/lifestyle impact of having their first child falls upon them (literally fencing off all the money their husband spends on himself as 'necessary' but not the money they spend on themselves, then also do all the childcare), and act like that is completely normal and not at all insane. Its amazing how when one person mentions coming across something like that everyone else will go ""OMG I have like six of exactly the same story! I thought I just knew weird people! How come people don't talk about this!?!?!"". I and my friends aren't in that sort of situation, but it seems like couples with totally different value systems like that are super common and loads of women (and men) just nod along like that is completely normal.               

I mean, we can all have our different lifestyles and ideals if they work for us. But I don't think its unreasonable to expect that someone I'm spending my life with holds the same priorities as me and holds themselves to the same standards, right?"

gatekeeping,ffudwlq,t1_fftrbgm,1580239913.0,"> There were some points throughout my fight in which all I had to do was train myself se things differently and think positively    

I mean, this is basically what CBT (the most clinically supported type of therapy for depression) does.      

The problem with depression to an extent *is* distraction from those things, like the cartoon says. But the problem isn't just that you haven't noticed those things are there, or that you don't try and focus on the positive, its that your mind keeps going back to the dark place and ruminating on the bad stuff, and then you keep beating yourself up for that, and vicious circle. Then throw in how that leads to behaviour patterns that make things worse, even more viscous cycle.           

A lot of modern therapies essentially focus on 'retraining' the mind to stop it from doing that. By taking very small steps towards questioning your thoughts, refocussing your thinking, explicitly rationalising instead of automatic thinking, as well as slowly introducing positive behaviours and rebuilding social networks. But is a *long, hard, exhausting slog of a path*, even if its worth it - its not something you can just do from the get-go.         

The human mind is a complex system of wants, needs, desires, learned information, memories, fears and passions. You can't just go ""I've decided I'm going to want this and be happy about that and no longer fear these"" any more than you can go ""I'm sick of feeling hungry when I don't eat, I just won't feel hunger any more"" (and actually in a lot of ways its harder than that analogy, you can start to just ignore hunger, but just ignoring your feelings will only lead to numbness). Those patterns and systems *can* be changed via talking/behavioural interventions, but it isn't easy or immediate.  As with all types of training, you have to do it over and over and over until it starts to become easier, and a lot of the time you need outside support or frameworks to do it with.             

Its partly why I don't really like 'mental illness is an illness like the flu/a broken leg' analogies. Yes, it should have as little stigma as those things, but.... it's a lot more complicated than just something that always 'just happens' for no reason and then 'gets better' with time/drugs (though don't get me wrong - drugs can really help, especially in conjunction with therapies)."
BreadTube,ffu1n8c,t1_ffsyh9r,1580232555.0,"> May I ask how do you think using science to inform our beliefs about the world works? That's a serious question, if you just accept bias of that kind and find it not worth mentioning, I don't know why (and how) would you update your beliefs based on the studies.     

What I mean is that in a journal paper, they won't often go in depth ""The drawbacks of longitudinal studies are....."" and ""Selection bias means that....."", unless they are of a *particular* relevance in that study. They might well mention it briefly, but not really go into how that means x/y/z. Because it's assumed that the readership already knows these things, and it'd be a waste of time for the reader (who is likely doing research and reading 100s of these things) to state it every time.           
If you were writing a university thesis piece of research or whatever, you'd be expected to go into it - both to show that you understand, tried your best to address it, and because you have a much higher expected word count. But academic journals reporting research tend to have much shorter articles.       

It isn't that the researcher or the reader is unaware of selection bias etc., the idea is that you read research with a working understanding of these things, its just that it isn't specifically mentioned in the paper.     

>If I were to pick most likely source of bias, it would be those who refused to participate. That's 60%. When phone surveys are being done, they go to great lengths (if they give a fuck, that is) to make sure that everyone they call talks to them - because for example people who are not available at the time when they call may represent a different type of people.     

They might go to lengths to *attempt* to get as great an approached to respondent rate as possible. But realistically, people who do phone research can't actually get that. I mean... when someone calls you and says ""I want to ask you a few questions for some research you are doing...."" and you either pretend to be busy and then block their number or tell them you don't want to. And you're not allowed to harass potential participants or pressure them into it, because that would be unethical - most ethics committees will stipulate that you state repeatedly that the participant can withdraw at any time.      

In my experience of conducting and participating in research - a large number of potential participants will just tell you to fuck off because they can't be bothered and that is really supposed to be that unless you follow them down the street.          

>All the p values and whole game of making claims about population based on research relies on sample being random.     

But in the social sciences, it's really never random. You can try your best to control for everything, to reduce selection bias. But in most areas of research, its impossible to get rid of it all together.     
To give an example of a classic piece of research - the Stanley Milgram experiment into compliance. Those people who when approached by a researcher saying ""We'd really like you to participate in our study"" agree to do it, are likely more compliant than those who say they're not going to do it, so are not a truly random population sample. But, short of frog marching people off the pavement in handcuffs to participate, there isn't really much you can do about that.     

>Those are all the things that few years ago were pointed at as problem, and just like postmodernism pointing issues in modernism is no longer hot news, those issues are all still just as real.     

I remember the stuff you're referring to, about problems replicating studies etc. And there was definitely stuff that can and should be addressed.    

But the whole thing of never having a truly random population sample, is kind of written in to the nature of the social sciences. You can point it out all you want, but there isn't an ethical way to make it go away, however well you design your questions or sampling method - there will always be 'people of the disposition to just tell researchers to fuck off' remaining the world's unstudied group.     
You can decide that the social science are completely invalid because they use p values despite not having truly randomised data if you want, and to be honest fair enough.

But isn't that a pretty standard participant drop for a longitudinal study of this length and nature?        
 
I would disagree that it's unlikely. Its *possible* that a significant number of that group dropped out due to beliefs and feelings about their abortion (in either way), but its also I'd argue its also more than just possible that they simply fell off the grid due to moving home, got more busy and de-prioritised participation, or simply didn't feel like participating anymore for other reasons.     

I don't have time to read the full study right now, so I don't know if the researchers discussed it at all. But I mean, even if they didn't - in my experience selection bias is just kind of accepted as the obvious way of the world in all studies to the point that its silly to mention it constantly, since these papers are pitched at people who are familiar with reading this kind of research.     

I find that Watson is generally pretty good at presenting research fairly and admitting flaws in research that supports her point of view, and she doesn't mention selection bias in every study not supporting her point of view even though it will almost always be a factor, so I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt that the reason she didn't include it wasn't agenda or bad reporting."

One way would be putting it on the primary PSHE syllabus.    

I get the resistance - its fucking dark and horrific, the idea of exposing even more innocent tiny little girls to even the *idea* of it is naturally something most people don't want. But the people who would be developing the and delivering the content would be at various levels those who really know what they're doing. There are people who are experts in how to get the necessary information about really dark and horrible subjects over the small children at an age appropriate non-upsetting level, and the people delivering it would know those children well as individuals, care about them deeply and be trusted by them.         

I mean, it's been statutorily put on the high school syllabus as a preventative measure (which people still aren't happy about). However, sadly, in the most cases by age 11 its too late for preventative action - so in some ways trying to make the 'this isn't unnecessary, we need to' step more palatable, they've made it less justifiable.          

It's something we need to seriously consider, at least.      

The other one is culturally sensitive education and outreach in at risk communities, ideally by members of that community. People feel like the 'culturally sensitive' part of that is PC handwringing over something that doesn't deserve anything but the most direct action at all levels. But these are often people who experience racism, prejudice and xenophobia from people around them on a day to day basis. It really needs to be done as a grassroots working together thing to combat the idea that this is about stamping out their culture and 'otherness', rather than educating about the alternatives to a horrific practice *within* that culture and community, with other options they should be part of creating in their own community."
TheBluePill,ffr5n53,t1_ffr3jm3,1580150982.0,"It's ridiculous and a pet peeve of mine. As someone who teaches science.      

Because:     

1) Science isn't hard. And I don't say that because 'I don't find it hard' because I'm clever. I'm not really all that clever. Don't get me wrong, science *can* be hard, sometimes you have to work really hard, stick with it and not give up. But it isn't somehow inherently more difficult than anything else - its just a way of studying things the same way as all the others (like just today I was looking at a kid's English work and it was being discussed amongst English teachers, and in my head I'm going ""Oh God I literally have no idea why any of you are saying the things you're saying I'm so dumb"", and it wasn't higher level content or anything). Going into it with the idea that it's hard and therefore you can't do it is honestly the majority of the reason a lot of people find it difficult, which in turn annoys me by making my job a lot more difficult.                  

2) ""STEM"" (or ""STEAM"", with art in it now, is the new one) encompasses *a lot* of different fields/jobs/careers. Thats literally how we're supposed to sell it as well. Which is awesome in the sense that - science is important, and cool, learn science at school everyone. But there are loads of different types of things you can do ""in STEM"" at loads of different technical/intellectual/creative levels, and I refuse to believe that someone who writes books analysing sources on 16th century French history is somehow less intellectually capable than someone ""In a STEM field in most capacities"" because ""there are less numbers"". I mean, *come on*, how fragile is your ego that you need to pretend that is the case?

What I mean is that, for the most part, when couples separate because of cheating, the men live singly and the women live singly with the children, at least until some other arrangement is sorted out. Thats different than say being along with multiple children to support off one wage until the child support comes in (unless cheating husband is willing to just give money from the get go), if you manage to keep your job when suddenly having to do all the childcare.

(Just focussing on the times where the assumed father is genuinely deceived about a child he believes is his biologically, though.....)      
    

But also, it's interesting how whenever this comes up, it is often presented as somehow a likely moral failing in women/mothers that does not apply to men/fathers. The comments here are not an exception.     

However - it takes two to tango.      

The common tongue in cheek slang is to talk about the mailman or the milkman, as if they are a ship in the night that spunked and disappeared. But in reality the majority of married people's affairs are with those in their community - neighbours, friends, colleagues.     
So you've got the other party involved in the conception who:     
1) Fucked someone he almost certainly knew to be married. Yes - when a cheater cheats, its on the cheater not the cheated with. But considering the husband is often someone known or even close to him, guy doesn't get off morally scot free.         
2) Statistically, was likely also married himself. So is also the cheater, just on someone else.       
3) Most likely knew that it was, or was likely, his kid. Because again - in the community/workplace. If you have sex with a woman, and about nine months later she has a baby, you're going to know or heavily suspect that is your child. Every time you get a woman lying to her partner about the biological paternity of their kid, you've probably got another man happily going along with it (and often *encouraging* her to do this) so that he doesn't implode his own family either. He generally isn't volunteering to his wife that little Jimmy down the road is her kid's half-sibling either, or caring that he has a kid out there with no interest in what the fuck happens to it.         

Don't get me wrong - people who cheat on their partners are bad, and people who cheat and then mislead someone about biological parentage of their children are fucking despicable.    
But while the nature of how babies happen means that its generally the biological mother lying day to day, and she may be despicable for that, but at least you can understand the 'excuse' (because it isn't enough of one to justify it) that she could be left alone holding multiple kids. The bio father's scenario if his family find out is more just finding a flat and having to do his own laundry.       
 

It brings to mind that classic joke, where little Billy tells his dad he is in love with the girl next door, and his dad tells him he can't see her because its actually his sister.

It probably doesn't account for the whole discrepancy, particularly women being more likely to attempt suicide, but it's almost certainly part of it.         

In terms of diagnosis once they have presented - I think for the most part these days, medical practitioners and the like are aware that men can experience depression, are aware that it doesn't make them 'weak' and are aware of the particular toxic masculinity based stigma that may make it even harder to talk about (though, I mean.... its not easy to talk about and reach out for most women either). I can believe that there are still some 'Don't cry, man up!' terrible practitioners out there, but I doubt that accounts for much of the difference if any.

AskFeminists,ffi4pi1,t3_etreff,1579965006.0,"There are quite a few things that it could be down to:     

1) It could be that experiencing sexism and living as a minority group (as in, not being seen as the norm or 'full person' in a patriarchal society) is hard, leading to more instances of depression, especially in those already prone to depression.           

2) Women more often act as carers and/or do more emotional supporting/labour, and are more likely to have careers that are related to 'caring' and supporting others. This can be emotionally taxing, and therefore could lead to depression, especially in those already prone to depression.        

3) In terms of being more likely to be diagnosed as depressed, it could be that women are more likely to present for support when experiencing depression.        

4) Its possible that the hormones that cis-women (and some trans-men) live with - so the cycles of menstruation, post-natal etc. - can lead to more depression in those already prone to depression than those with different hormones. (Edit to be clear: This absolutely DOES NOT make the depression experienced any less real or valid. The idea that woman are 'being hormonal' is often used to dismiss women's feelings/opinions/anger, which is just sexist bullshit. What I am referring to is the way that we as human beings all experience the influence of our body's hormones the same way that we can be impacted by outside experiences - including men. Its just a possibility that certain hormonal experiences, particularly post-natal, can account for some instances of depression in cis-women.)

>chase career success, want sexual freedom, and be a champion of women's rights or something       

or an idealised 1950s idea trad-con 'helpmeet' housewife.        
But the reality is, luckily, that there are loads of different ways you can life and prioritise your life that aren't those two things.     
Personally, I don't care about career. I care about my job in the sense that I work with children and young people, so I care about them. (By the way if you find it hard to get out of bed in the morning because you give zero fucks about making money for other people, I'd advise 'helping people' type jobs, because to be honest its the only way I have the motivation to show up.) But I don't care about 'my career' in terms of 'success' position/renowned/power/etc. Never have, and to be honest I think the whole system is fucked anyway. Apart from caring about the actual kids I work with on a day to day level - I care about making money to live and thats all, same with my husband.         
I'm also kind of a 'prude' in the sense that I've don't like to have sex with guys I'm not in a relationship with, and am now married - no problem with people fucking anyone and everyone, just not my personal preference.     
People think feminism and wanting 'independence' is synonymous with the idea of the power dressing CEO dedicated to rising to the top, being the best and banging hot men you meet in bars in the evening. Not so - you can care about women's rights and also think that sounds like the least appealing life ever.         
There are all sorts of things you can care about in life, and prioritise in life, maybe while working to live in a job you hopefully don't despise every second of in the meantime.      

3) Kind of irrelevant to what you want to do, but maybe it isn't I know - the kind of life you're talking about was never really a thing in the 1900s apart from for a very small minority of women. In the time you're talking about, and the centuries before it - *rich* women didn't work. And their husbands didn't really work either - rich people's job was basically 'owning shit'. All other people - men, women and often children - worked.      
The mid 20th century thing you seem to be referring to - men in some blue collar and lower white collar jobs working while their wives stayed at home - was really a blip in the timeline (and also poorer married women absolutely still worked). And that kind of makes sense - the idea of one person actually going to get the shit that helps the family survive while another able bodied adult just sort of 'looks after' them.... not the most efficient way of getting by.     

I don't know man.... you do you, absolutely. 100%. Just if I was going to advise you, I'd suggest if you've realised that career focus and sleeping around isn't for you, thats great, but.... be a bit more open minded in terms of re-evaluating what you want.     
If not only because, in my experience, people who date with an 'ideal partner' already formed in their head that they're looking for don't tend to have much success. Humans are complicated creatures, especially when you've got an interaction between two humans in the mix, and sometimes what makes you happy isn't what you thought would make you happy (as you are now realising about your past ideals and goals). Like, you can still have family dinners, look out for your community and hold moral values in high esteem without buying into a 'lifestyle'.       


Its very easy when you're dissatisfied and a bit lost to pine for the 're-emergence' (because if never really existed, especially if you were poor/black/gay) of some seemingly lost rose tinted past. But if you want to be happy it might be better to instead to take the bits of your life, family and community that are good and throw out the parts that are bad - because otherwise you're chucking the baby out with the bathwater."

I get where you're coming from in the sense that you appreciate your wife. Thats lovely and great. I mean... it shouldn't be SPECIAL and singular, but its lovely and great.

There are stories I have both heard about and seen first hand where her husband will remember what their teacher said, or take them to buy uniforms, or remember their immunisation date off the top of his head when she needed to check - and people act like he is somehow dropped from the heavens. It's awesome that he is a good dad, but his being a good dad doesn't take away from her being a good mother. They share that, and its fucked up that people are surprised they share that, or act like its somehow him picking up her neglectfullness. 
But it seems like, from what people say and how they talk about it, he is like a dog walking on its hind legs. Whereas with her, she'd get your normal role encouraging pats on the back for being a good mum and working as well, but its also EXPECTED of her to know their teacher and go to everything on some level. Its not expected of him. But he does it, because they're both their parents, and their kids *need* that from someone so they step up to the line.           

For all your dramatic love letter to your wife - you chose her as well. And thats great, awesome. But personally my partner and I don't talk like that, and to be honest neither of us would be totally comfortable with it (maybe just being peak British).      

I choose to dedicate a good portion of myself to my family (currently not children but my parents and sibling), including my partner, not because I'm a martyr but because it makes me happy to be a part of that. I don't need my husband to see me as dedicated to being 'the ultimate wife' - I can't be the ultimate wife, I'm not perfect, I can just be the best wife/mother/daughter/teacher/friend etc. I can be. My husband does the same.

Its like the whole ""If you were the opposite sex would you date yourself..."" threads going on here. I mean, yeah, I think I'm a good catch. But I'm a long way from perfect, and I'd probably piss myself off a lot.

While I totally understand this is a big stress saver if you can afford it while the kids are little, in the long term it's kind of why I want to continue working.    
Both my parents worked, even though my dad had a good job. Other people in my dad's job took on more roles and responsibilities that helped them progress to get even more money, but meant longer hours/weekends/more thinking about work and working at home. My dad didn't have to do these things for us to have a comfortable lifestyle - because my mum worked.     
And that was really important to me. Because I'd have hated to see my dad less, or not have my dad be able to come to my kid stuff, or not be able to go on holidays with my dad, have his mind be elsewhere when he was with us etc. I never doubted for a single second that my brother and I were more important than career or making money, to *both* my parents.       

My point is, having my husband not be super stressed and distracted and barely see the kid/s we hope to have is more important to me than the size of his paycheque. Thats why I've been working on my career - not because life and family is less important to me, but because life and family are more important than career to us *both*.     

Like - cool if you can make it work so you're both enjoying yourself, not stressed, happy, actively parenting and making enough money to live with a SAHP. I know some people can, and all power to you. But a lot can't, and it's weird to me when people will imply that somehow having a SAHM in the family means more 'family focus' when sometimes it seems to me to mean the family actually has less of one."

But there would be a lot of penny pinching, we would have to live in a VERY small home, we could never really go anywhere on holiday in this country never mind abroad. Things like going to the cinema would be a huge deal.    

I'm pretty cheap in most ways. I don't buy myself much - hate clothes shopping, buy cream/make-up but can't be bothered going to the beauticians or getting my hair cut much. But things like nicer food, petrol for a trip somewhere, school stuff and opportunities for a kid if we have one - they add up.

The thing is though, it just doesn't fit that under a capitalist system that basically everyone could do x/y/z and make 150k a year. Not even the majority of the middle class.    

The reason that only a small minority of families can have a comfortable lifestyle off one person's income isn't to do with bad career advice - its written into the economic system itself.       

And I know underneath you said you're not talking just about STEM, but that is still the obvious one people go to, so....      

The reason that jobs like software and electrical engineering pay so well is due to:    
1) Tech boom     
2) An educational development system that wasn't prepared for that and was slow to catch up.         

While number one is going to keep going (though arguably as we move closer to highly developed AI, the way that these companies need actual workers to do things like write software etc. is going to change), number two has changed rapidly in the last couple of decades.      
So far we're had a number of these type of STEM jobs with only a few people to fill them, so the companies have had to compete for good workers. But eventually we could well end up with a surplus of qualified workers, and then the wages could drop dramatically. Because - capitalism.         

I mean - I'm a high school physics teacher, so I'm all about encouraging kids into science and maths, to help them in the future but also because I think science and maths are just the coolest and everyone should know about them.

I feel like we're setting kids up for a life where they have to fight against all their inclination not to do something that doesn't interest them, motivate themselves in-spite of that, and it might not be all that great once they get there in the future.

But I've been around hospitals and other medical situations, and doctors don't ever say ""The female in bay 6"", they say ""The woman in bay 6"" - even when they're being formal.       

Basically the idea that 'In scientific communication, they say male and female"" is ridiculous.

I'm in a position of your post, but flipped. My husband is the neat-freak, likes everything just so, crumbs to be swept up immediately etc. I personally couldn't care less if there are a couple of used mugs left on the side, a bit of dust, open letters left out etc.       

We both compromise, really. He does in the sense that he will just tolerate the flat being a bit (he'd probably say 'more than a bit' haha) messier than his ideal.       
I compromise in that I tidy up to *more* than just to my standard. In some ways I've sort of trained myself to do it to more his standard. Sometimes after him pointing it out to me and asking me to do it. Like, just after we got back from work, I had left some stuff in the sink, and he said ""Can you do your washing up?"" so I went and did it - even though I was doing something else and I didn't want to. I'd have been fine with it just sat there, and hadn't thought about it (I have the attention span of a gnat which is kind of why I'm like this), but I did it because that is his way of letting me know its bothering him and basically he doesn't want to just do all my washing up for me.       
Sometimes he will just do it, 'it' being tidy a few extra things away an move a bag to the side or whatever, and for that reason he probably does more of that kind of stuff than me (the littler things - when we do a 'big clean' of our home, we both do it and split the tasks, and I tend to do that bathroom more than him).            
So while he does more, I also go out of my way to make sure that he can have a home that he enjoys living in without having to constantly pick up or clean up after me.           

We haven't totally got it right either and sometimes there is friction, but for the most part the system works. Because it's either that, 'be miserable' or 'split up' - and we don't want either of those things, so there you go.

Bullshit.    
Penises don't create some sort of mess hiding glamour spell. You don't care because you see no problem with just going about your day without consideration for your family, and/or you're just a lazy arse who would rather wait for someone else to break and do it for you while you get on with whatever you like. And/or have some weird delusion that somehow 'not enjoying cleaning' is a personality trait, and that their spouse is actually getting kicks out of picking up after you as much as you are out of reading or gaming or whatever it is you're going instead of helping.   
And I think the basis for it is a society and often the family they were raised in implying ""You don't really have to do that stuff, other people should do it for you"", which they then absorb and try and justify. Whereas I know I can be messy, but I've never been under the impression that its anyone else's job to sort that out for me.

My marriage is the flipped version of this. What (for the most part) works for us is the tidier one doing a bit more tidying, but the other trying their genuine best. Gender doesn't necessarily have to have anything to do with it - sometimes in relationships you have to work out a way to get by, and as long as you're both putting real love and care into each other and communicating, examining your expectations and beliefs, equality can look a lot of different ways for a lot of different people.

BreadTube,fe13q63,t1_fe00bwn,1578822207.0,"It's an anti-radicalisation strategy in the UK.     
As far as I understand it basically breaks down into:    
1) Making people, particularly professionals, aware of the signs of radicalisation and then acting as the body they're supposed to report to.    
2) Intervention for those being radicalised or at high risk of being radicalised.        

The problem is that if you're making the judgement that someone is being radicalised to extremist views, you have to first define what you consider extremist views, and that is obviously problematic - because for example a Marxist society in a high school could be seen as radicalisation by some (I mean, that example wouldn't be followed up as it stands, but the point is that it easily *could* be). Its be it's very nature an authoritarian and status-quo preserving step.    

It's also been argued by many that it's just a cover for a drive to surveil all the muslims in the country, and that 'vulnerable to radicalisation' in effect just means 'brown', basically making it racial profiling and generally racist policy.           

However, it can also be used as a tool to prevent far right radicalisation and white nationalism. I've had Prevent training (because I work in schools), and the training program features a mix of examples related to radical islam and white nationalist issues (some people argue the latter is just to hide that its a racist Islamophobic policy). Theoretically it could also be used for misogynist radicalisation, and - as evidenced by this - environmental groups.     
       
And I mean.... where I worked at the time I had the training was the very definition of white working class.... so we were aware during the training that we were more likely to encounter the far-right extremism than anything else.

BreadTube,fdhfypt,t1_fdgq0d8,1578421826.0,"I think it would be one thing if he had been sort of transphobic once.    

But he has been repeatedly transphobic, buckling down on his transphobia with 'well I identify as an attack helicopter' type shit in response to the initial flack he got.     

He has also been frequently ableist. Both using various slurs on twitter (and again buckling down and escalating for ages when called out on it), and well....... Derek.        

Like, he is 'progressive' in the sense that he makes fun of racists for being racists sometimes. But just saying 'I think racism, sexism and homophobia' are bad doesn't make you progressive - I mean *Donald Trump* would openly state that all those things are bad.     

I don't hate him, don't want to 'cancel' him, and I mean - The Office is good. But calling him 'a progressive' because he generally resembles a sane person more than he does Ben Shapiro is allowing the Overton Window to make a seismic shift.     

You're right in terms of calling out problematic speech and behaviour to people on the left that will listen, but Gervais has shown *repeatedly* he has *zero* interest in growing in that respect. Which is pretty much the antithesis to a 'progressive' outlook, even if your political party selection is to the left.         

I mean, I live in the north of England - most of the die hard misogynist, racist homophobes I know are also lifelong Labour supporters."
AskFeminists,fdh5aq1,t3_eld4vs,1578415691.0,">I don't feel guilty about it but I have seen videos of feminists going nuts about this kinda stuff on YouTube. I'm assuming not everyone is that irrational considering people put these kinda videos out to show radical women who say they are feminists but only care about women.     

While I'm not arguing there are *no* people on Youtube 'going nuts' about sexualised video games, all the feminist video game commentary I've ever seen has been reasoned analysis.    

I mean, Anita Sarkissian is the most well known - and obsessively discussed - feminist video game critic (and its worth clearing up the language here, 'critic' doesn't mean they are critical of the existence of games or their moral worth, it means performing a critical analysis if media, just like a 'film critic'). And the stuff I've seen of hers is the polar opposite of 'going nuts' about it - its your pretty bog standard feminist academic media critic fare.     

As you say, there are plenty of people on youtube who will select, edit and misrepresent the content and speech of others to make feminists look 'crazed', to push an agenda.     

In terms of if its a problem and what should be done about it.... the over sexualised and shallow representation of female characters, and the use of violence against women to be 'exciting' and 'edgy' is a problem in all media. Games are a little behind in confronting it even at all, but they're far from alone in that. It bothers me both in the sense that I game, and would like games not just be made clearly for a male gaze and have better female characters, and it bothers me because I know for a fact that legions of children play GTA.      
      
What should be done? Developers should make better games. Thats it, really. I don't think any games should be banned, just that games that aren't about murdering strippers and have active interesting female characters should be made and celebrated.       

The thing that actually makes me laugh with the people who get all het up about feminist video game criticism, is how they will go to bizarre and extreme lengths to 'prove' that a lot of mainstream gaming is made for the male gaze. When it quite obviously is. And that doesn't mean its evil and should be banned and is played by bad people - hell, a lot of it is played by women, and feminist women, despite that.       
When a character has a cartoonishly sexualised ass or is fighting monsters looking like Jessica Rabbit in a bikini, that is done to titillate a straight male audience who like looking at sexy women. And thats OK - there is nothing wrong with liking to look at butts, and buying a game where you can look at cartoon lady butts because of that.     
But let's call a spade a spade, and admit that piece of art is not made that way for creative reasons that appeal across the board, its made for teenage boys who want to look at butts. And its OK to want games you can play without being reminded THIS IS NOT FOR YOU every time the character turns away on the screen, and suggest such games should be made."
AskFeminists,fdeptmz,t3_ekwecr,1578344097.0,"No.    

To be honest, while I think its OK and useful to use the gender flip rhetoric for other things, I think even if you're joking about *hypothetical* rape victims its pretty bad. While people are less likely to ask 'what was he wearing?' about a male victim of rape, there are still problematic stuff that is said and thought about male rape victims due to sexism and toxic masculinity (particularly homophobic shit and the idea that it is somehow 'emasculating' or a sign of weakness to be the victim of rape), and these things sometimes mean that male victims also are also ashamed and afraid to come forward.      

Unfortunately 'She was asking for it in that skirt' and 'Come on, you're obviously secretly gay or you wouldn't have gone or would have fought him off' are sides of the same toxic gender expectations coin.     
There are ways to make jokes highlighting the absurdity and hypocrisy of 'asking for it' rape ideas about women without taking down male victims in the blow.     

I don't know. I think possibly because I'm from Manchester, and I've been to the clubs he targeted many times back in the day - those victims could easily have been my friends, my brother, my cousins, my colleagues. But the idea of making light of what happened either to them or victims in similar situations seems pretty vile."
