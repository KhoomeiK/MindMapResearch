AMA,fcgrpy1,t1_fcgm57v,1577643404.0,Idk if it was freaky but I went thru a lot of emotions when I looked in the mirror. And I kinda just looked at me and just u know like saw me and I liked it. I stared for a while. Not sure how long tho. It was cool tho might do it again lol
AMA,fcgjd51,t1_fcghouk,1577640766.0,"Well Iâ€™m by myself rn I feel fine a little off the wall but Iâ€™m tripping so Iâ€™m kinda just letting it come to me lol. U r different from me. Idk u so I couldnâ€™t say how it would affect u. Sorry I know this doesnâ€™t help too much. U wonâ€™t go crazy btw. But bad trips are supposed to be a thing. I havenâ€™t experienced that either tho so idk.

U know what u should probably ask someone who has more experience actually. ðŸ˜‚"

AMA,fcfpp6b,t1_fcfnz3x,1577632562.0,"A playlist from the YouTube channel ENM that I made itâ€™s like mostly edm music. 
The specific song is So Alive by Random (ft. Aliya Sachi)"
depression,fb7s1bl,t1_fb7pldi,1576598049.0,"Probably an aversion to work. This isnâ€™t an excuse tho. If I want to pay for the things I need... I have to work. For some reason making myself go hasnâ€™t been working these last couple days. I hate myself for this. I hate myself so much. I wish I wasnâ€™t born or that I could just get hit by a car. Literally worthless. 

As for the suicide and depression idk. There used to be reasons probably a combo of a lot of what u said. Thing is itâ€™s been so long. Years of this void hopeless feeling like my life was over before it started. Mostly my fault. I wrote a bunch of stuff down over the years in a journal. But my head over time has just gotten so foggy I canâ€™t really understand why Iâ€™m the way I am anymore. It doesnâ€™t make sense tho I think."
