Oddly specific. Almost like you've breathed air on fire before. ðŸ¤”"

aspergers,fe888ul,t1_fe6dwmy,1578923613.0,"Adult woman here. Definitely have the very same concerns about going for an eval and then going home and realizing I forgot a million things pointing to a diagnosis of Aspergers.

Super cool of you, OP. Super cool."
