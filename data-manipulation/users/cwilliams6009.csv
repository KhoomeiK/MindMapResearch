sugarfree,ffd6tre,t3_esxj58,1579814552.0,"A couple things that have helped me as you ease into this process: drink lots and lots of water, freshened up with a bit of lemon sometimes if you wish (but not too much because it’s hard on your teeth). Plan high-protein, high vegetable meals and make them a little bit special. The first few days especially he might want to have lots of delicious snacks on hand that are sugarfree. I like air popped popcorn, banana cashew smoothies, and some people like flavored teas and salted nuts. Extra salt in your meal the first few days will help you not to get headaches. And plan slowly: on day one, see if you can make it to noon no sugar. Try that for a week, and then in shop and see if you can make it until dinner time etc. This is a process and it will take some time but you will get better at it. Keep checking back with this forum and connect with other people as well who might be supportive :-)"

But, I also sometimes find them quite delicious and more importantly, they do not seem to trigger me the way regular sugar does. Enjoy the cheesecake, and carefully evaluate yourself whether it is a trigger food for you. Everyone on this forum finds their own way in this and that’s one of the reasons I like them :-)"
