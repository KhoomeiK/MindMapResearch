I would never agree to such a thing in the first place. I think the whole idea of eating and drinking stuff you know you won’t like just to be polite is nuts. I’d never expect anyone to eat or drink anything I offer them nor be mad if they rejected it. In some instances, you could maybe argue it would be polite to taste something, but there are many foods I could tell you I will hate without trying them. There’s no way on earth I would even take a sip of moonshine that apparently tastes like paint thinner because I would probably like all over the floor the second it touched my tongue if not before from the fumes. You can say you warned her all you want, but it seems like she follows along with everything else and she probably did not understand how bad the alcohol would be if you even warned her about it specifically until it was right in front of her. It’s ok to change your mind on such a thing."
AmItheAsshole,fcmpzqh,t1_fcmdldw,1577786490.0,"Would it have been better if she tries to drink it and ended up spitting it out or puking from the taste/burn? Because if it were me in the situation, I wouldn’t have drank it, but if I did, I am pretty sure that’s exactly what would have happened."
AmItheAsshole,fcmpt8q,t1_fcme0na,1577786233.0,Did you tell her specifically about the moonshine and how horrible it was and make it clear she would likely be expected to drink it?
AmItheAsshole,fcmp46j,t1_fcmiieu,1577785239.0,"I’m going to shut you down here. His parents failed him by not having him see a doctor but they didn’t necessarily do something wrong with his potty training. I bedwet much longer than your average kid. My siblings stopped at the normal age. We were all potty trained the same. He could and likely does have a medical reason for this. It could be an issue with bladder weakness or an issue with his brain getting the signal to wake up if he needs to pee or sending a pee signal in his sleep. Don’t make fun of someone for a medical condition. 
He’s a problem for not dealing with it, but not for having the problem."
AmItheAsshole,fcmoxl8,t1_fcmfgym,1577784979.0,"Coming from someone who bedwet much longer than the average kid, he’s TA. I understand intimately the embarrassment that comes with bedwetting. That’s not an excuse not to try to deal with it. Doctors are understanding and bound to privacy. How can that be more embarrassing than wetting your bed around your girlfriend for years?"
AmItheAsshole,fcmoibs,t3_ehyz3o,1577784373.0,"From the title, I thought you were going to be TA, but I’d say you’re NTA. He should be cleaning up after himself and seeing a doctor about it to see if something is physically wrong. 
I can truly sympathize with someone bedwetting late in life. I did it for years longer than most kids. It makes you feel immature and you worry what people will do if they find out . However, that is not an excuse not to see a doctor when you’re bedwetting as a grown man. Don’t be too harsh on your boyfriend about that actually bedwetting, but he deserves to be cracked down on for not cleaning up after himself and no going to the doctor."
AmItheAsshole,fcmnpz0,t1_fcmg6bk,1577783273.0,"Pretty sure that as long as he agrees to do work in exchange for the money and you can prove he gave you the money, it would still count in small claims court, but I’m not a lawyer or anything."
AmItheAsshole,fcmnnwm,t1_fcmgaua,1577783192.0,"Don’t tell yourself it’s scummy. Leaving a negative review for or warning the public about a company that screws you over isn’t scummy nor is warning people that the person they pay for services may put them on the back burner if they do him a solid and pay him early. I would certainly want to know that, so I don’t end up like you. Warning him and giving him a chance is a kindness that allows him the opportunity to shape up and do better."
AmItheAsshole,fcmlrfo,t3_ehzlo4,1577780630.0,"NAH but you should be careful if you don’t want to burn that bridge. Tell them you’ve overcommitted yourself and that while you really wish you could intern there, it’s just not in the cards right now because you need more hours at a paying job to cover expenses so you won’t be homeless and school already keeps you busy or something along those lines. Maybe offer to help wrap things up / help with passing along your events to a new person."
AskReddit,fcmdc0x,t1_fcmd22j,1577771235.0,I realize how much money it is. I also realize that it wouldn’t be worth it to me. The guilt would be overwhelming. Everything I bought would just make it worse because I would know it was blood money.
AskReddit,fcmbt01,t1_fcm271z,1577769854.0,Umm. I can confidently say that I would not torture or kill innocent people for 5 billion dollars.
todayilearned,fckuwvt,t1_fckoa0l,1577733720.0,"You just misquoted it as well. “A bit sticky, things are pretty sticky down there.”"
AmItheAsshole,fcjrzor,t1_fcj3zy6,1577701705.0,"I saw a commenter say his wife shouldn’t be spending so much on makeup. 
Do I personally find it insane to spend $1000 on makeup, yes. I also find it insane to spend thousands on action figures and videogames. However, I’m sure I spend money on things other people think is insane. As long as all your needs are being paid for and you’re saving money for retirement and emergencies, then you should be able to spend on whatever your hobby is and that should be okay."
AmItheAsshole,fcjrgew,t1_fcjpkfh,1577700919.0,And if it were gaming systems or first edition signed novels or musical instruments?
AmItheAsshole,fcczg82,t1_fccz3dn,1577604493.0,"Yes, but you said she’s made it clear she isn’t paying at all which is untrue."
harrypotter,fccz2pq,t1_fcbydzm,1577604371.0,Actually wouldn’t it be ironic. Nearly Headless Nick was stuck with his head on partially not completely off. We wouldn’t expect him to be headless because not being headless is his shtick. There’s irony in that he always wanted to be headless to join the headless hunt and such and never could.
AmItheAsshole,fccclge,t1_fcb0rvh,1577596861.0,"What do you mean she made it clear she isn’t paying? She asked for a payment plan, yeah? Seems like she wants to cover it, she just can’t afford it right now."
