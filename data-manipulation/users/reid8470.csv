netflix,ffya87b,t3_evugw7,1580341635.0,"I will never understand why the producers of these shows get celebrity narrators with no academic credentials relevant to the documentary/docuseries.

David Attenborough makes for a great narrator not only because of his voice, accent, and tonality, but also because it feels like he could be personally teaching the audience about the topics he narrates instead of merely reciting what actual experts write. No, he doesn't have any graduate education in any field of biology, but it was still the predominate topic of interest throughout his early years, and he dedicated essentially his entire career at the BBC to the natural world from the beginning.

It's for these reasons that I *wish* docuseries producers would genuinely try to impersonate David Attenborough's narration. Find narrators with some personal level of credentials in the show/documentary's topic -- people who can genuinely contribute to the script and speak personally and enthusiastically to the audience instead of actors paid to read a script.

Imagine if TED talks were only written by the experts that would otherwise present on their expertise, and instead presented by actors with no personal credentials on the topics. It'd likely be a far less popular stage than what it's grown into today."

politics,ffrl239,t1_ffrki76,1580160230.0,Yeah it's precisely why it's a two-stage process. *And* there's the part where arguing that an impeachment isn't legitimate unless it's bipartisan introduces the problem we've seen: What happens when an entire political party is willing to defend a POTUS facing impeachment regardless of the merits of the case? The argument falls apart under scrutiny; they're essentially saying that any president can do anything they want so long as their party supports him or her in the House and Senate. Obviously that's absurd.

politics,ffegi90,t1_ffec4pl,1579847107.0,I'd want to see him as AG because policies matter for POTUS and his policy record is simply milquetoast. The guy's strength is in prosecution; he was a very capable US attorney prior to entering politics and would probably serve as an extremely effective AG. Clearly he hasn't lost any of those skills as his handling of the entire impeachment process has been downright impressive.
politics,ffe36pu,t1_ffdzppn,1579835503.0,"Which has its tradeoffs; Sanders' plan also costs substantially more. I said in another post tonight that if I had to vote right now, I'd vote for Sanders, but I think Warren's plan on this topic is a better starting point for debate while Sanders' reaches into excess. I know people frequently decry reminders of our nation's debt and deficit because Republicans are so hypocritical on the matter, but it is still a genuine issue and cost effectiveness needs to be weighed in any public policy. It's why single-payer is, in my opinion, a no-brainer as it's the most cost-effective healthcare model in the developed world, and it's also why I think means testing and dollar limitations should be fundamental to any student loan debt relief plan."
politics,ffdqdvs,t1_ffdfccb,1579826433.0,"To anyone wondering (as someone who has held Warren and Sanders fairly evenly, but would vote for Sanders if I had to vote today), Sanders is of course a sort of anti-corruption candidate, but Warren has been far clearer on anti-corruption. She has a set of ~9 plans stuffed with various anti-corruption legislative and executive policy proposals and she has repeatedly stated that these would be her #1 priority if elected.

I fully trust that Sanders, if elected, would also push for anti-corruption measures, but Warren's straightforwardness on this topic is very appealing; her approach to it seems substantially more structured than Sanders'. In a nutshell, the reason I'd vote for Sanders over Warren right now is I'm more convinced of his ability to meaningfully increase voter turnout as the nominee than I am of Warren's, and I see that as crucial to winning the Senate in 2020 or 2022."

science,few9tua,t1_feuueey,1579407296.0,"BCBSM is the worst insurance provider I've ever dealt with. I have to call them Tuesday to deal with being *triple charged* for next month after already having called them several times in November and December to deal with being double charged and with getting a plan for 2020 because they told me I couldn't renew my 2019 plan. What instead happened was my 2019 plan auto-renewed two times over, so now I technically have three active, identical insurance plans that I'm being billed for.

The support representatives I've spoken to have been utterly useless; it's felt like speaking to a brick wall. The BCBSM site has also been buggy in lots of other ways. It's ridiculous that a major corporation with ~$30 billion in annual revenue is such dogshit at delivering *its primary product* to its customers, and the asshole who has been running the company for 14 years likely earned ~$20 million in 2019 -- highest among Blue Cross executives and among the highest among health insurance executives in the country."

todayilearned,fde1gun,t1_fddrgfc,1578329038.0,"Logging *can* be used as a tool to remedy problems previously caused by people; if you look at Tongass National Forest before the Trump Administration decided to relax a lot of its regulations, the US Forest Service managed logging permits to generate revenue while using managed logging to eliminate invasive tree species groves and whatnot.

Large-scale timber operations in, for example, the Pacific Northwest from Vancouver Island down through Oregon, on the other hand, have led to a massive loss of the region's old growth temperate rainforests in what is unquestionably a net loss for those environments.

From a more sensory perspective, the difference between timber land and old growth forest is night and day. Old growth forests are, in my opinion, some of the most beautiful environments on our planet and we should be looking to restore as much old growth as we can (though it is a several-hundred-years-long process)."
