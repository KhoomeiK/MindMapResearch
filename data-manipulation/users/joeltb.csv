whatisthisthing,ffu481a,t3_ev79au,1580234144.0,An old Japanese Beetle trap. The attractant would be placed in the mason jar and the beetles would fall in and not be able to get out.

trucksim,ffmo966,t3_et8kut,1580057230.0,Nope. Quite the opposite actually... Sometimes I catch myself wanting to manually shift in my automatic Forester. lol
trucksim,ffmnx9f,t1_ffj57ov,1580057107.0,Heads up.. That £1 does not go to the modder.

newhampshire,ff9hdp7,t3_erzuxj,1579713053.0,Had a Warren dude stop by the other day. Tried telling me that Bernie only sponsored 2 bills. LOLWHAT? Better do more research buddy... I should have invited him in and researched it right before his eyes.
Documentaries,ff6x5bq,t3_er4h86,1579636707.0,"Surprised I had to wait 10mins into the doc before they mentioned ""They are trying to take our guns away!"". LOL

Oh, and that black guy talking about the confederate flag... LOLWHAT?! He might want to pick up and read a history book or two."
newhampshire,ff6sia9,t1_ff6scbx,1579633965.0,"It's not that bad... It's a process by which they break your bottom jaw, move it forward a couple millimeters and then wire it shut for 6 weeks. It fixed my sleep apnea. :)"

coolguides,ff4cig9,t3_erkiuu,1579560396.0,So should one be vaping at 220°C to get the full benefit?
newhampshire,ff2wut3,t3_er87pm,1579527134.0,"So let me get this straight, they stated nothing was wrong and on the way out you fainted and they still sent you on your way? That seems very odd.
I've been to Parkland 2 times: Once for stitches and once for a bilateral saggital splitting osteotomy both of which went fine. The only thing they fucked up was my hospital bill. I hope you get the care you need! There is always Dartmouth Hitchcock up north or go into Boston if you want topnotch care."

trucksim,fety2sr,t3_eqi6m3,1579381194.0,"I feel qualified to answer this. I started with an Ultrawide monitor(Samsung 49"" curved) w/ trackIR. I have since progressed to Occulus Rift S and won't ever go back. If you have a decent CPU/GPU and can afford VR, get VR. VR+Logitech 27 is the best experience.


PS: I no longer use my TrackIR since I upgraded to VR. PM if you are interested in buying it. Just make an offer ($USD)."
itookapicture,fejxjk8,t3_epjywf,1579188129.0,This is my fave part of this highway. I always look for that cool gothic-looking building.

newhampshire,fedoyk6,t3_eo7gxz,1579016733.0,I once asked in r/scooters about this. The site is vague but I believe if it's under 50cc no license is required but it does need to be registered. Either look at my post history for my post asking the same exact question or go ask in r/scooters.
