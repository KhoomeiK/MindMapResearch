TwoXChromosomes,fgibjr4,t1_fgi9mcm,1580815532.0,The new yorker writer is the dumbass and worse. I can't really blame average day people who have no understanding of how the criminal justice system works for being moronic and knee jerky.
TwoXChromosomes,fgibhy6,t1_fgi80h6,1580815463.0,The prosecution has a very easy job in doing so. Im not gonna take the dudes thunder but above you a guy outlines multiple specific scenarios where she changed her story and where collected evidence didn't fit the story. Its the guilded one that even links to the source material for the case.
aww,fgi8dtb,t1_fghvzlm,1580810994.0,Hey pal what the fuck is this thing? TO be clear this isn't a meme. Seriously what the fuck is the creature staring at the strawberry.
todayilearned,fgi869e,t1_fgi7zjs,1580810672.0,Its not like she was beating the fuck out of us or anything which mind you she would do she was by far the one who would beat us the hardest(the same RDC who did the first story) but when she did she would always follow the rules. Just someone being a crybaby which is pretty par for the course in the Navy.
todayilearned,fgi83y7,t1_fgi7zjs,1580810574.0,"Not that interesting of a story. She just had the guys (cuz i was in a coed division) do ""pretty ladies"" which were a type of plank where you had to  put your hands on your cheeks and your knees on the ground and stretch out while kicking your feet and sing stupid songs like Im a little teapot and barbie girl while the girls would do jumping jacks and chant ""The boys are so pretty oh so pretty"" I thought they were fuckin hilarious and surprisingly challenging."
todayilearned,fgi54f8,t1_fgi4gay,1580805992.0,"If you are military he ran the card on me. If you aren't Navy RDC's basically have a card with exercises they are allowed to force you to do. They are no longer allowed to make you do whatever the hell they want (Our one RDC didn't care and someone snitched on her and she almost got removed from our division because of it.) Basically this card has 10 exercises that include pushups, walking planks, mountain climbers, butterfly kicks etc all at different amounts and he just gave me the whole card."

todayilearned,fgi3hvl,t1_fgi24wg,1580803780.0,"I don't know the very specific things aroud this case but your thought process isn't one that the courts agree with. With things like verbal contracts the  ""reasonable person"" argument is often the argument that decides which way it will go. If a reasonable person could interpret the contract the way the one who is suing did often they will side with the plaintiff. These word games don't really stick up in a court of law."

Futurology,fggt4sh,t1_fgfv4o1,1580768971.0,Very curious. What shaped your world view that nuclear energy was evil? Ever since I was a little kid I can remember learning that it was potentially very dangerous but when handled correctly was very clean. Wondering if geographical political landscape may have something to do with our opposing fostered viewpoints.
Futurology,fggslkm,t1_fgfdqir,1580768633.0,"Tell thise to r/worldnews who's very first rule is No US internal news or Politics yet everyday I see posts that are news that favors trump get removed for violating rule 1 and ones that demeen him stay and get 20k upvotes. I am by no means a trump supporter but hes hardly the super villain reddit and media portray him to be.

Overwatch,fgez6ki,t1_fgekqyt,1580716115.0,Even ninjas cant double jump. The whole reasoning behind genji having the double jump was futuristic robotics which suree i guess ill give you the creative liberty. Hanzo is just a dude with a bow.

summonerschool,fgcntif,t3_exqjzy,1580674523.0,I mean i get both sides. Unless you are like very very young or playing with 300 ping or 10 frames I don't know how you can be iron if you play 100 games. Like youtubers struggle to get iron accounts to smurf there even when they basically int. Is this your first video game?
navy,fg9aakb,t1_fg8tesp,1580636192.0,Alot of this comes from civilians who worship any military member like they are a war hero or something. Im in a few political facebook groups and there are some guys who try to come to my defense acting like im a hero whos risks my life every day fighting the taliban or something and how dare these people disrespect me. Like dude chill. I work on electronics. The biggest hazard to my life is myself.
worldnews,fg97w9a,t3_exiq1f,1580635302.0,Rule 1 no US internal News or Politics. How does this not violate that rule? Because it fits the narrative or just lazy mods? At least apply the rule effectively across all opinions. I don't even agree with the trump supporters but god damn you have a job to do.
newtothenavy,fg8oje6,t1_fg8lrhb,1580626682.0,But i was like you I was already E-3 so i wasn't trying to get a job. I just did what i was told to do. I didn't partake in the late night pow wows(god these were cancer) and just was an average recruit doing average things counting down the days till i was out.
newtothenavy,fg8oeyt,t1_fg8lrhb,1580626535.0,"You are basically me then. The RDC's didn't know my name until i got beat once for something like super stupid like not shaving properly and it seemed like i was having a good time. I was then known as the ""Stupid Nuke"" and didn't get beat unless compartment wide anytime i fucked up I was just given shit watches. Its pretty easy to keep your head down and not get noticed. The actual bootcamp part of part boot was super easy it was the isolation from Gf/Friends that was tiresome. Rest was just kinda cool."

newtothenavy,fg8k3ft,t1_fg8izfb,1580622004.0,The RDC's were always really chill on sundays. Even the super uptight ones would joke around in the compartment while others were at service.
newtothenavy,fg8k1ry,t3_exj6gl,1580621960.0,Yeah the jokes go pretty far but that's just normal. I got a stupid amount of them but it really didn't matter much to me. Not sure why its affecting him so much guess people are just different. Sounds like hes having a pretty rough go at it but going to chaps isnt a big deal. The religious thing i def saw a spike in my friends that died out later on but a few stuck with it. Im not religious so myself and did not go to any services so cant speak to what goes on there etc but alot of people seemed to enjoy their time there. I enjoyed my time chilling in the compartment shining my boots. As long as he doesn't have a straight up mental breakdown or quit himself he will be fine and graduate soon.
