And you're literally missing the point. Most ""wealth"" in this country is fake. Bezos doesn't actually make a thousand dollars a minute. Gates doesn't have 10 billion in his mattress. If Amazon stock falls by 50% bezos loses an absolutely fucking astounding amount of ""wealth"" overnight. Suddenly his ""power"" and influence are dwindling with every point his stock loses. And stocks are volatile. We've seen massive collapses in companies and markets from much smaller events than a general strike or revolution.

[Reminder that a report came out exposing a massive pedophile ring in the UK Parliament over 30 years ago.  No consequences ever happened and we literally ""lost"" all the paperwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_paedophile_dossier).

>In 2013, the Home Office stated that all relevant information had been passed to the police, and that Dickens' dossier had not been retained. It was later disclosed that 114 documents concerning child abuse allegations were missing. In July 2014, the Labour Party called for a new inquiry into the way that the allegations had been handled, and the Prime Minister, David Cameron, ordered the permanent secretary of the Home Office, Mark Sedwill, to investigate the circumstances of the lost dossier.

>On 7 July 2014, the Home Secretary, Theresa May, announced a review into the handling of historic child abuse allegations, to be led by Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC, and the establishment of a public panel inquiry into the duty of care taken in the protection of children from paedophiles by British public institutions, led by an independent panel of experts and chaired by Baroness Butler-Sloss. Butler-Sloss later stood down as chair of the inquiry.[2] On 5 September 2014, it was announced that it would instead be chaired by Fiona Woolf[3] but on 31 October 2014 she, too, resigned from the role.[4] On 4 February 2015 it was announced that the inquiry would be chaired by Justice Lowell Goddard, a New Zealand High Court judge. The existing panel would be disbanded, and the inquiry would be given new powers.[5] On 4 August 2016, she also resigned from the role.[6] 

So they announce a separate investigation on the way the original case was handled and the investigation changes hands three times with each new person resigning.  Because *someone* put in a phone call and told them to.

But once you're born, you're on your own. Pro-life conservatives are obsessed with the fetus from conception to nine months. After that, they don't want to know about you. They don't want to hear from you. No nothing. No neonatal care, no day care, no head start, no school lunch, no food stamps, no welfare, no nothing. If you're preborn, you're fine; if you're preschool, you're fucked.
> 
> Conservatives don't give a shit about you until you reach ""military age"". Then they think you are just fine. Just what they've been looking for. Conservatives want live babies so they can raise them to be dead soldiers. Pro-life... pro-life... These people aren't pro-life, they're killing doctors! What kind of pro-life is that? What, they'll do anything they can to save a fetus but if it grows up to be a doctor they just might have to kill it. They're not pro-life. You know what they are? They're anti-woman. Simple as it gets, anti-woman. They don't like them. They don't like women. They believe a woman's primary role is to function as a brood mare for the state.
> 
> Pro-life... You don't see many of these white anti-abortion women volunteering to have any black fetuses transplanted into their uteruses, do you? No, you don't see them adopting a whole lot of crack babies, do you? No, that might be something Christ would do. And, you won't see a lot of these pro-life people dousing themselves in kerosene and lighting themselves on fire. You know, morally committed religious people in South Vietnam knew how to stage a goddamn demonstration, didn't they?! They knew how to put on a fucking protest. Light yourself on FIRE!!

I'm sick of hearing this feel-good bullshit. I'm fully aware that people with a functioning moral compass exist, but it all means jack shit when they're not the ones holding the power.  You can sit there and assure yourself that if you ""vote blue, no matter who"" your whole life that you can somehow undo the foundations of corruption that have poisoned human civilization for thousands of years, but you're wrong.

Humans are shitty, selfish little creatures who have the occasional shining moments of cooperation, but the people who are willing to exploit everyone and everything around them will always rise to power, because that's the kind of people that power naturally attracts.

A lot of this stuff makes more sense if you remember that the reason people are okay with it is because they're living under the delusion that they'll be in a position to take advantage of things like this in their life.  People will let b/millionaires do anything they want because to them that is the pinnacle of achievement.  If you've made it that far in life, you should be able to do whatever you want.
