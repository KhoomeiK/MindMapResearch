islam,fggynh2,t1_fggoud6,1580772533.0,"Except that's not it, is it? The school has been asking children to consider if they are transgender and encouraging cross-dressing. Evidenced by the teaching of the books “the princess boy,” “Julian is a mermaid,” “the boy in the dress” and numerous statements by children to their parents.

There has also been encouragement for children to think about whether they would want to be in a same-sex relationship and go against their parents’ culture. Evidenced by the teaching (previously) of the book King and King, also the lesson plan for the book “picnic in the park” which asks some children to role-play being a gay couple and again evidenced by children’s accounts of other teaching and practices.


Parents have the right to educate their children in accordance with their religious beliefs. Article 9 of the Human Rights Act 1998 – freedom of thought, belief, and religion.
Article 2 of the first protocol re-emphasises this, “in relation to education and to teaching, the State shall respect the right of parents to ensure such education and teaching is in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions.” As an arm of the state, the school should ensure this is so, or IT is breaking the law.
In response to the consultation regarding RSE teaching published in February 2019, the government stated that it should be taught, bearing in mind the religious backgrounds of pupils.
The Children and social care act (2017) states, in respect of mandatory relationships education for primary school pupils, at section S34, which gives the enabling power to the secretary of state to lay down the regulations and the guidance, that religious background and age appropriateness must be taken in to account. It also states that BEFORE any of this education can be delivered there has to be a consultation. At Anderton Park, there was NO consultation. Parents had to find out when children came home telling them that the school told them that girls could/should be boys and vice versa, amongst other stories.

This is the LAW."
islam,fggq7fp,t1_fggohdc,1580767142.0,"I believe that society needs rules and the best source of these rules is our creator. He has given us the percect unfallible system of Islam and thus personal whims and opinions are irrelevant. Whether someone is happy or unhappy with abusing someone is irrelevant where i live (UK) because there are laws that criminalise it. Same with Islam and every system with laws! 

Modesty is a reason behind hijab yes, but the ulterior and ultimate reasoning for Muslims is to please Allaah for which they will be rewarding for and for seeking safety from the hellfire. Whether Islam is correct is not a matter of opinion, or something unsure or indefinite it is the truth wherein only falsehood would opposite it. 


Wearing hijab is not usually worn in the house unless in the prescence of those outside the family.  Your friend has valid concerns but she must consider fearing Allaah above all else, and pls remind her that that those who hate Islam, those who want to harm Islam, those who lack reason, they cannot with all their efforts harm Allaah. He is the Wali (protector friend) of the believers, she should be reminded that striving in the path of Allaah will be greatly rewarded!"
islam,fggika9,t1_fgg6pfa,1580762607.0,"The Muslim does not hesitate to believe in the great wisdom of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, in all that He does. One of His names is al-Hakeem (the Most Wise) and one of his attributes is hikmah (wisdom). As such we accept that the firm ruling must be that both sexes must respectfully remain covered  as determined in the Sharia (Divine rulings)."

I think u are referring to the Hadith about the mothers feet. But there is also a Hadith that says: ""Any women dies while her husband is pleased with her, she will enter jannah"" The knowledgable scholars who wrote this took the time to gather authentic sources to form this answer, give it a read with an open mind!"
