All the things you mentioned? Those are things she can explain to him, but in the end she does need to own this. She didnt even offer a direct reason here for why she kicked him out, only alluded to it. He made it clear that this was a major life event that meant the world to him, he was doing everything right, and in the end she arbitrarily robbed him of that moment. It was completely selfish and there is no way to undo it or make it up - you can't go back in time and give him that back. 

Do I personally think he's overreacting a bit? Yes. Do I also think he has a right to feel this way? Absolutely. What she needs to do is sit him down or write him a letter, explain the fears she felt in the moment, the reasons her judgement was (understandably) clouded, acknowledge his loss, and apologize. Offer time and space and show a willingness to do what it takes to work through this together.

I brought deodorant with me when I moved there, but of course I eventually ran out.  I checked all of the markets in my neighborhood and none of them had deodorant.  I could get detergent, toothpaste, painkillers - whatever else I wanted.  But no deodorant.  Have to go to the bigger stores for that."

However, I'm by no means particularly knowledgeable about this and you're probably right that winds and currents had a lot to do with overcoming such vast distances."
todayilearned,fcveqmv,t1_fcuuw9q,1578000559.0,It's not that strange when you consider how huge the Pacific Ocean is.  Hawaii is 2.4k miles from California (2.7k to Baja).  Easter Island is 2.3k miles from Chile (2.6k from Peru).  That's a lot of open ocean to navigate.  Their journey east to these islands up to this point would have at least involved island hopping.  Not a lot of islands to hop to after these ones.

If the latter, there's your money issues. Try to stay as close to your force limit without going  over. 

Some other tips from a mediocre player with a lot of hours:

-Fort upkeep is a bitch. Turn off fort maintenance unless you expect to be attacked (in the military tab you can mothball them all or do it manually by clicking on the province). Delete unnecessary forts. 


-Make sure youre stating territory. Pretty obvious but worth mentioning.


-Disinherit shit heirs (not sure if this is a problem with your tag). My general rule is at least 9 in stats. Better to (usually) take a prestige hit than lose out on thousands of mana. 


-Use the estates for free mana. The military estate can also be used for levying manpower, if you get some extra loyalty. 


-You can also trade 5 professionalism for manpower, if youre getting desperate. 


-Make sure youre spending surplus gold on profitable buildings. 


-Adjust your merchants. Your home trade node will auto collect, but make sure youre targetting high value upstream nodes and directing them toward your home node.


-Change alliances if you need to. Allying the allies or enemies of your enemies are both solid ans can buy you time to expand or stabilize. 


-Dont be afraid to use vasals. Sometimes its better than annexing territory directly. It can save you admin points if youre currently low. 


-Dont be afraid to set your army maintenance to 0. Drilling troops will still cost money, and you want to raise maintenance before a war or if rebels will spawn, but this can save you tons of cash during peace.
