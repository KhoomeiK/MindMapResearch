If I remember correctly he had a list."
phish,ffjlpow,t1_ffj3szo,1580001138.0,"I met him in Syracuse. Note I have a giant crush on Mike, so when I realized pre show he was just casually leaning up against the wall of the venue I went to say hi. I asked about a pic, but he said he didn’t want to be mobbed. He does really like to people watch. So he shook my hand instead.

Then as I was coming out of the ladies, he was coming up the stairs and my phone flew out of my hand and landed in front of him. He hissed at me which was hilarious.

Set break I’m in line at the ladies again, one girl behind me. He walks to the green room and instead just casually gets in the ladies line and starts just friendly messing with the girl between us whose wearing led earrings.

End of show, he’s signing and my bf grabbed a set list and I brought it to him to sign. He looks at me and goes “you again!” 

Best you again ever. Every interaction was personable, but you can tell Mike has the type of personality that might be hard to read, and he is willing to interact with fans to a high level, but will also firmly regulate the interaction.

I think just because he’s out doesn’t mean he wants a photo or what ever every time. He likes to watch people and be himself which is fair. That’s my read anyway."

The sent of weed smoke isn’t going to have a deleterious effect on either of you and your neighbor is probably not at all conscience that it’s circulating to you.

One thing as a heads up on- looks like she’s slender- sometimes often in fact, you can feel the rods, either when you lean on something or your muscles move or snag on something. As a child prone to anxiety I had some pretty intense freak outs about having a foreign object in my body that would never come out. They weren’t common but it happened. My dad made me sit down and drink a shot of whiskey once.

My dog has done this since puppyhood. If he gets over stimulated he will dig a whole quick and gulp down dirt. I used to call him pica puppy. I read that dogs often carry thing in their mouths when excited like sticks as a way to help rate their emotions, and I thought maybe this was sort of a compulsion that had its roots in that. 

What helped was recognizing when he was going to go to the “puppy crazy” like state and try to intercede to calm him down before that happened. I say puppy crazy but he’s going to be four this year and it will still happen sometimes. He’s also very reactive and once he gets fixated he’s very hard to redirect."

Dogtraining,ff38eda,t1_ff2vhdh,1579536123.0,"I appreciate your input but disagree that this is a situation that merits medication at this time. He’s getting routine vet care and my boyfriend who is co owner of the dog is a vet tech. We’re not against meds but I don’t think this is a qualifying situation at this point.

I agree that trying to train inside won’t be the best place to start, he will focus better outside- but he’s not terrified 24:7 in the house. He walks around, gets on the furniture etc. he’s actually more relaxed by a long shot than he was a few months ago. The issue simply persists when he gets himself into a tight spot and won’t try to back up or turn around, and that he seems to be unsure of where he’s putting his but when being asked to sit or lay down on command. When in this situation, he trembles like a nervous chihuahua. Except many times larger.

Trust me, should it get to the point where progress has stopped, or we lose ground and it gets worse I will certainly consider some anti anxiety medication. He is an anxious dog. But he’s getting bolder every day, but I strongly feel that helping him practice how to move his body will help with his confidence. If it doesn’t, we will go from there. 

Thanks !"
Dogtraining,ff2atxd,t1_fezpgcs,1579499027.0,"You know, simply working to train him to take a few steps back / back up on command didn’t occur to me. Would be a good way to slowly condition any muscles he’s not hitting.

Setting up obstacles and starting out side is a good idea, that way he is more relaxed. 

And yeah, it has been since April. Not that there’s been no improvement, but I agree that it seems like it’s been long enough time for some intervention. 

Thanks."

Dogtraining,ff1nmj9,t1_ff1kii5,1579482177.0,"The leg weakness has been a factor. When he first came home he struggled with movement and had no muscle tone. Now however he’s pretty ripped, if still struggling with weight. he’s allergic to every food ingredient but chicken and soy so there’s basically like only one special diet kibble or canned food he can tolerate he eats 12 cups a day but hits a plateau with eating more than that and all the running he does.

It’s important to note that he flys around like a pup and wrestles his bro like a bear and can go for hours outside, so while we started with no tone- he’s definitely gotten more fit.

We do have hard wood, but he seems fine in the wide parts of the house. It’s definitely the tight areas he struggles with. For instance walking through the kitchen, it’s a narrow galley kitchen. He won’t  turn around in it. So if he walks in and is blocked from walking through by me cooking or the other dog etc he will stand in one spot and start to shake. In the living room where it’s more open there’s much less shaking and sometimes he will play with his brother. 

That’s why after 9 months of observation and ruling other stuff out I’ve come to notice that the shaking has an direct relationship to his proximity to indoor furniture. Crashing through bushes seems fine. He can run and jump and play and get up and down off the ground. But inside it’s like he’s playing a game of operation and he’s the tongs."

We have a one story house (minus steps to the basement) so if he’s not ever super stable. He doesn’t have to be best, but if there’s a way to make him more comfortable I’d like to try. He’s just such a different dog when he’s in a big open space."

We do some basic behavior stuff, but his general good manners means I haven’t been consistent as I could be. We’ve mostly focused on recall and sit. I try to make sure we practice sit a couple times a day so he has to put his butt down and get a cookie. Inside however he will either go sit on his bed where he knows the space or go sit with his butt on the couch and paws on the floor which while hilarious he doesn’t get the cookie for.

scoliosis,fevmcdj,t3_eqk5cx,1579399056.0,"One thing to keep in mind, is that while staying fit and active is key, your spine isn’t going to process wear and tear the same way. So talk to your doctor about not just “should you do x” but “what will the long term ramifications of doing x be.” 

For instance I ride horses, but I know that I am more likely to fracture them area above and below should I fall, that falls hurt way more for way longer (I’m also 20 years older lol) and that anything that requires lumbar flexibility is going to make my lower back kinda stiff.

So to counter that, I don’t ride super nutty horses, use equipment that will help me warm up faster and stay more limber, and i appreciate that it’s keeping my core stronger, which is a net positive.

Divorce,fecb9df,t3_eoap92,1578970031.0,"I think at some point we have to look at the institution of marriage not what we made it in the last 100 years, but what it was before that - a social contract designed to make life easier for the parties involved.

God willing we all are gonna get older. It’s easier to build and maintain a comfortable life in a partnership. It’s easier to get old when you have family to help care for you. The load of life is easier when divided.

Caring about and respecting a spouse as a partner makes that possible. For a long time romantic love was a bonus, something that grew from lust or grew from respect if it grew at all. 

I’m not saying we return to arranged marriages, but it’s worth it often to nurture that spark and keep the love and respect alive because it can keep the partnership afloat.

It was a mistake. Sometimes mistakes are really really large. Sometimes they are really small. English doesn’t have separate words depending on the size of the mistake. You can use modifiers, like big or small, but it’s still a mistake, even if it’s a big mistake.

Regardless I agree with you, my answer was more to illuminate why there’s a legit discussion about when current pain levels should be considered as a deciding factor in surgery choice and that in the end, neither parent or patient should have rose colored glasses on about her chances of being cured of future pain.

Because I’m not a doc I don’t want to guess if they think this will progress past growth. If it’s likely to per the doc, surgery is likely the best option because this is already a pretty not great situation. 

But if you have 30-40 degrees, it’s been stable and there’s no pain I don’t think people should rush to operate.

And I think it’s important for parents to know about the potential future. My parents (although both overly emotional and prone to irrationality) have a hard time about my not being totally cured to the point I don’t even bring it up. My dad thought I was lying for attention when at 23 I had to have more work done (then later that year some more) by 28 when I had my last revision he had moved on to that to being depressed that I was having so many issues and constantly repeating the refrain that they regretted getting me the surgery.

I can’t imagine being a parent and having to make this choice for my child. That’s weighty. No one ever told us about a lot of the complications I’ve encountered and for a long time I thought I must be an especially bad case until I learned that a lot (a lot a lot) of teens with severe cases wound up as adults with the backs of 70 year olds by their 30s.

I’d be hella way worse off if my parents hadn’t made that choice. I’d likely be fully disabled and my organs being crushed. BUT it would have saved some mental anguish had I been prepared for the reality of this situation."

Theoretically they have no purpose once the fusion is set. My neuro seems reluctant to remove the whole thing, though I don’t know why. But I totally get your pain. My left trap always gives me issues, and when it’s really swollen and tight it feels like it’s just scrapping over the rod end/screw head, and the pain lasts for days, making it hard to breathe at times, let alone concentrate on work or life.

But my docs are all like lol whatever 30 year old fusion patients are all in pain suck it up and take a Tylenol. 

Good luck!"
scoliosis,fdncjkl,t3_em75we,1578582867.0,"The question is : is the curve likely to progress after she stops growing. If the answer is yes- surgery. If the answer is no- I would not get a fusion.

Pain isn’t necessarily a prerequisite BUT don’t go into it thinking you’re saving her from back pain later on. Look into adjacent level syndrome. It’s something a lot of patients aren’t aware of going into surgery. Simply put, it’s all the degenerative stuff that happens to the unfused sections of spine above and below the fusion. In the end patients with fusions - especially lumbar fusions often have chronic pain due to herniated discs, arthritis and stenosis around the fusion.

Now balance that against will her curve progress and cause all sorts of issues and more without surgery? 

Fusion mitigates scoliosis symptoms. It is in no way a guaranteed cure like it is often promoted by surgeons. Don’t say this to scare you, but this is information I wish I had. Not because I would have chosen against surgery, but I would be less surprised as a 32 year old with a metric buttload of back issues that stem from fusion related wear and tear on surrounding joins and tissue."
