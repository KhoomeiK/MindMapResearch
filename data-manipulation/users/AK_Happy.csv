Damnthatsinteresting,fee10nl,t1_fee002u,1579024144.0,"Very true, also good points.  It's definitely worth knowing the details of the plan, as you previously mentioned to OP.  

Back in 2012, this plan was great under my employer.  $2,500 deductible with no coinsurance (so that was essentially the max OOP), plus an HSA, plus a much cheaper premium.  My max cost was closer to $6,000/year, reduced a bit thanks to my HSA contributions.

Costs slowly went up over time, but 2020 marked a massive and terrible change. Our premiums doubled, max OOP went up $1,500, and the HSA was taken away.  So it got almost prohibitively expensive for me.  It sucks to consider looking for another job after 8 years, solely because of the health plan."

Also, I felt it's important to note that premiums exist outside of the OOP max.

My insurance premium for my family is over $12,000/year.  So I pay over $20,000/year for healthcare, plus more if my wife/son ever need care."
Damnthatsinteresting,fedsvc2,t1_fedpyqi,1579019172.0,"I'm insured through my employer - costs me over $12,000 / year in premiums.  Beyond that, I have a max out-of-pocket of $8,150, which I always meet because I'm on dialysis.  So I pay over $20,000 / year with insurance, and that's if my wife/son never require any medical care.  

I would also say my healthcare is excellent, but it's extremely pricey with insurance plans getting more and more expensive each year.  I've been with my current employer for almost 8 years, but I'll probably have to look for a new job that has health plans more aligned with my needs.  It's not a great system from my viewpoint."
