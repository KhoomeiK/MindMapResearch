Also, there are beautiful dresses out there that dont cost 2k. Maybe offer your haute couture pro self to help her personnalize one instead? Could help you two bond after all this drama."

askscience,feqvp4z,t1_fepp8pg,1579346618.0,"Thank you so much! For taking the time and for a great answer :) Its such a weird field of study, very interesting but typical logic doesn't seem to apply. I guess it makes sense that living things would not follow a cold math like schematics. And that's why its so complex, to my limited understanding, you cant just learn formulas you have to learn and understand every separate element and how they influence each other. And also they don't always influence each other or they do it more than seen before... Its insane to think the amount of work that went into understanding even part of this enough to make rules that can be efficient in anyway."

askscience,fep48mx,t1_feosbsb,1579311782.0,"Thank! Yeah it seems pretty complex! So that's why vaccines are giving the pathogens and not the antibodies... Makes sense. 

Then say someone would receive blood from a very healthy person with lots of white cells. Would they inherit (so to speak) the immune history of that person? Would that be passive immunisation too? 

When making a vaccine, do they need someone's antibodies to prove its survivable/ has immunization potential? Or is any virus ""vaccinable""? 

Sorry you don't have to answer but you are the only one that gave me a detailed answer and people seem to downvote me because I guess my post looks like some anti-vaxx propaganda. Its not btw I'm just very curious about how it works because I just took my baby to be vaccinated not long ago."
