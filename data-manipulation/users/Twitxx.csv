Sure, the system sucks but doing nothing while crying about it won't do anything to change it. You should always prepare for the worst anyway. I've been taught this from a young age and it's always saved my skin when I've been sick and unable to work. Sure it sucks that I've lost all of my savings every time something like that happened but at least I didn't end up homeless. You only ever lose if you give up."

iamatotalpieceofshit,fdqk6jy,t1_fdqj3dy,1578668649.0,"You cannot, not always. Those fuckers would have me destroy a perfect 1911 airsoft gun replica even though I called the airline in advance and got instructions on how to pack it properly. I let them know it's in the checked in baggage once I was at the airport. Airline rep freaked out, called an airport employee which called security and they wanted me to destroy it in front of them. Luckily I was able to pay 20 bucks to hold it in a deposit box until I got back. 

They can be such assholes sometime and more often than not it seems like they make up rules on the spot and they won't have it any other way than their way."

antiwork,fdmrt7n,t3_em661c,1578562620.0,"I mean, not to be that guy but, depending on the job, it can actually be dangerous to personal or public safety. I remember one time one of my colleagues got in trouble for it because a car almost ran him over due to wearing airpods."
antiwork,fdmnmfn,t1_fdml892,1578556976.0,I mean who could tell that being able to afford to eat and pay rent would make people feel better so that they wouldn't feel the need to off themselves?

LifeProTips,fdeb52o,t3_ekl1ek,1578335172.0,"Reading the title, at first I thought exactly the opposite, as in, make sure you separate the clothes in different suitcases, each to its own.

Made sense to me, as I remember a time I got picked for a random search at the airport and I had to explain for over an hour to airport security that the reason why I had so much female lingerie in my suitcase was because I was travelling with my girlfriend and not because I was a pervert. Fun times, they didn't really believe me so it was a long time."

getdisciplined,fcmzvqj,t3_ehsdfs,1577799079.0,"I'd advise that you choose a fifth of all these goals and stick with them as much as you can. Take it from someone overly ambitious that tried something similar and ended up burnt out before 25. Some of these goals will take up 10x more of your time and energy than you think and you'll end up stressed out of your mind, with mental health issues and a really bad image of yourself for not being able to carry them all out. Like Billy Joel used to say in Vienna, take it easy, what's the hurry? You're a kid, you have your whole life ahead. Good luck!"
EntitledBitch,fcjtf8s,t1_fcincyk,1577703804.0,Why call it a tip and not just inflate the price then? It seems unnecessary to have mandatory tips unless the aim is to divide people and make then fight over this silly idea.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fci3puq,t3_eh7xvv,1577657403.0,I don't get it.
EntitledBitch,fci1xb6,t1_fcg5poa,1577656761.0,No. That doesn't even make any sense. Only in America you could turn a nice gesture into an obligation so that capitalists can profit off of it and fill their pockets while avoiding to pay their employees a livable wage. At this point it shouldn't be considered a tip anymore but a service tax.
getdisciplined,fcg7eia,t1_fce5d46,1577637165.0,I was gonna say the same thing and scrolled down only to find your comment was already here.

EntitledBitch,fcdjzf4,t1_fcatcj0,1577610695.0,"I pay the shop, not tip the employees extra. The service is already included in the price as the mechanics work for said shop, not for themselves. They're not entrepreneurs, they are employees."
EntitledBitch,fcasjq6,t1_fc9wlg8,1577575770.0,"Or...how about I eat wherever I want because unlike you seem to think, I'm not obligated to pay you squat. Gosh, ""societal norms"". Do you hear yourself? The fact that you choose to play social games over what you think is right or wrong is your problem. If you've got a problem with it, complain to your boss or the government. No one should be forced to pay you extra unless they choose to."
