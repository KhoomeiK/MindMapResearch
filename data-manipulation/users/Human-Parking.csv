It’s hard taking care for him because he’s already advanced since he had a few strokes and never went to a doctor. I’ll try my best and hopefully something good comes out of this.

I’ll try to up the dose. Honestly I think we’ll need to euthanize her. My dad has 6 big dogs and it’s hard on me taking care of him and them and worrying about her attacking the other dogs. When I first got here, it was pretty bloody. She really ripped into one dog, but luckily I saved that dog and nurtured her back, but she keeps getting attacked. The aggressive one stays in the backyard, so it’s hard to separate when the other dogs have to go potty. I’ll keep this thread updated. Many thanks."
