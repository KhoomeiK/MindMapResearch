1200isplentyketo,fel6q16,t3_epm66t,1579215241.0,"I think I do my best when I plan out my food for the day. I tend to stick to it if it’s planned out. 

I recently tried incorporating “carb-ups” into my keto diet after reading some very interesting stuff about them in a keto book I have. I quickly found that without careful pre-planning a carb-up was an easy way for me to overeat on calories by a lot. So now I’m reconsidering adding these into my diet. I’m not sure I have the self control for such a thing. But we’ll see.

All in all, I think planning ahead will be your best friend. I do IF all day, then eat all my food intake from dinner time to midnight. That’s just what works for me and my body and schedule. So what I do is in the afternoon I’ll take a minute to sit down and plan out what I’ll be eating that night. I generally make it to where I eat a very small meal each hour throughout the night. I split my dinner into three small dinners, then have a few small snacks and a dessert. Each hour I have some food to look forward to. 

That’s just what works for me. It’s been probably my best keto habit."

stolendogbeds,feev70j,t1_feerb1h,1579041918.0,"I have both dogs and cats, and they mostly just ignore him. When they were introduced the cats were mostly indifferent, maybe mildly curious, and the dogs were definitely weirded out but that was about it. One of the cats did take a few naps next to the tortoise when he was first introduced which was pretty neat. The only time the dogs have a problem with the tortoise is when he goes near their food. They aren’t mean to him at all though. All they do is start aggressively eating their food trying to show him that it’s theirs. Everyone gets along just fine besides that."

The cleaner is called “Out! Advanced severe stain and odor remover” and it says it has 3X enzyme cleaning power. Another brand that works really well is “Nature’s Miracle”, just look for the one with enzymes. Those are the reason these work so well i believe. These cleaners should also make it so your pet doesn’t want to go again in the same spot. So really good for cats."
stolendogbeds,fedt8a7,t1_fedpfjq,1579019390.0,"He only goes to the bathroom directly after we feed him so we just make sure we feed him in the kitchen where it’s easy cleanup. Every once in a while he’ll do it on the carpet but we have a really good carpet cleaner for pet messes that works like a charm when that happens. He used to always go to the bathroom in her doggy bed for some reason but we put it up higher now so he can’t get in there anymore.

It’s pretty gross but really not as bad as you’d imagine it to be. Mostly he just wanders around the house and then back to his little home to sunbathe under his heat lamp or take a nap on his heating pad. He’s got a little cave that he knows is his home. 

If you have dog or cat food out I would put it somewhere he can’t get to it. Ours really loved eating other animals food."

keto,fdgt6hg,t1_fdf5cvh,1578407687.0,Before I lost weight I was worried I’d become overly flirtatious with men like I used to be before the weight gain. I’m in a really healthy relationship so I definitely didn’t want to all the sudden feel the urge to flirt with others if they gave me attention. But I was relieved to find that it wasn’t a problem at all. I enjoyed the double takes and the new attention after losing weight but didn’t feel the urge to reciprocate at all. I guess I was just younger before and less mature.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fcodenl,t3_ei6nx7,1577829509.0,"I’m 30 and I completely agree with your feelings on this. I think a lot of these girls are too young to actually fully understand what they’re doing. I remember when I was 13 years old (and I actually looked closer to 10 years old, I’ve always looked way younger than I am) me and my friend would put mini skirts on and cute little tank tops and we’d walk two miles along a busy road to the McDonald’s. I remember making a game out of counting how many cars honked at us. We’d see grown men honk their horns, lean out their windows and make kissy faces, holler inappropriate things at us, etc. and to us it was just an innocent and fun game we liked to play. We adored the attention. We’d never gotten that type of attention before so it was exciting for us. We didn’t understand how inappropriate it was that grown men were the ones giving us that attention. We didn’t understand that we were putting ourselves in a possibly dangerous situation. We didn’t understand that we were making ourselves targets for unsavory and dangerous people. All we understood was that someone was giving us attention, and it felt good. We felt pretty. We were excited to feel like grownups because everyone had always treated us like kids. 

Thinking back on that makes me cringe. If my mother would have known we were doing that she would have been furious. 

And at the time I didn’t realize how young I really looked too. Yeah, 13 is already way too young for a grown man to be hitting on you. But I literally looked like I was 10 years old. That means these grown men were hitting on what looked like a CHILD. 13 is already just a child. 10 is even worse. 

It’s disgusting. And it sucks that young girls probably don’t understand the implications of how they’re dressing. And I’m all about the sex positivity and the freedom to express yourself, but we cannot be teaching that to young girls. There needs to be a distinct line drawn on what ages are appropriate for sex positivity and what ages are not."
