offmychest,feygq0z,t3_eqrzyl,1579445301.0,Iâ€™m so sorry for your loss. I have the chills reading this. Honor her every minute of every day by staying sober. She is still your rock and she will always be with you!! Itâ€™s the hardest thing ever losing your emotional support person but youâ€™ve got this. Remember all she has taught you and said to you throughout your life. When you feel weak hear her words. They will be there if you let them through. Peace and one day at a time. Hell one minute at a time!
Rabbits,fepgm8d,t1_fepfy0k,1579319987.0,All the better to remember her by.  Hang in there!

relationship_advice,feo7cf5,t3_eq3aq0,1579296120.0,"What about Gamer Girl? What kind of a person would feel right barging in on a couples weekend? No common courtesy on both of their parts. I would go when they meet up and act ridiculously happy. Make it a point to let her know how happy you are with him. If by some miracle their relationship seems to be just a friendly one Iâ€™d beat his ass at the hotel room after the meet up for commandeering the trip to meet with her. Lol.  If there is anything more there or any sort of â€œgamer codeâ€ used Iâ€™d stick to him like glue from the meet up forward. Ditch him when youâ€™re back home unless he has a very good apology. Please keep us all posted and remember, there is only one today. Make the most of it and laugh whenever possible. Donâ€™t let him steal your happiness."

offmychest,fe65rq1,t3_enw02c,1578882415.0,I sincerely hope you tell your parents this.
relationship_advice,fdok7r3,t3_em99hd,1578606813.0,Iâ€™ve been where youâ€™re at and splitting up feels like the scariest decision in the world. Youâ€™re alone with kids and who will help you? I quickly realized I was better off alone. Life was simpler and more predictable. I count on myself for everything and I always come through. No matter what path you choose just know that you deserve far better than what you are getting.
