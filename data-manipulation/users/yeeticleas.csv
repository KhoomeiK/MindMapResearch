nihilism,fef2g49,t1_fef08ae,1579046598.0,"Your a good person Dimitre, who deserves the pursuit of happiness, you can’t keep subjecting your self to self imposed misery, you deserve better. What made you become a nihilist in the first place?"
nihilism,fef1he5,t1_fef08ae,1579045955.0,Optimistic nihilism is just optimism with extra steps because if life is still worth living despite being meaningless than that gives life meaning
nihilism,feezn5g,t1_feeuk1m,1579044747.0,If life is meaningless then why bother complaining about it unless your secretly hoping for somebody to tell you that it’s not

nihilism,feeqf6x,t1_feeqekv,1579039020.0,"First of all i want to make clear that i don't write this to brag. I don't write this to push my ego like everybody else who would claim what im about to tell you. I write this purely to inform you, to inform you about my astonishing intelligence.

Because it is a fact that im very smart. Its a fact that im the smartest person to have ever existed and nobody will probably ever top my level of intelligence. That's proven by evidence and countless scientists have confirmed that i am the smartest of all human beings.

I have taken hundreds of IQ-tests and every single one of them has failed to even come close to measuring my enormous brain capacity. I scored the maximum score on every IQ-Test i have ever taken. In fact my IQ is more close to infinity than to the IQ of let's say Einstein. I took my first IQ test at the age of 3 because my nanny was shocked as i tried to teach quantum mechanics to the other children at the kindergarten. At the age of 3 we're you could barely talk i solved complex math equations. As i scored 420 IQ points at a IQ test the psychologist coudnt believe it. But as i started to explain to them how the test results all were in fact correct they immediately understood that they were no match for my intelligence. At the age of 7 i already was giving lectures at Harvard University about every topic of sience know to mankind. Even Stephen Hawking visited my lectures and as the lecture ended he clapped louder than everyone else in the room. E=mc². For you that is some sience magic that you will be never able to understand, for me its as basic as 1+1. In fact i already knew that E=mc² before i even read about Einstein coming to the same result. While you are reading this i probably have already discovered a new quantum mechanic equation. While you spend your useless time on your phone i train my mind to access even greater levels of intellect.

It will be just a matter of time and i am going to be the greatest scientist to have ever existed. Its just a matter of time that i will discover the ultimate universe formula. Its just a matter of time that i will be president of the earth and maybe even the universe. My genius is so magnificent that nothing can stop me from achieving my goals.

You probably won't believe me but that doesn't matter. What your little mind believes doesn't matter because every other smart person on earth already has accepted that im the smartest of them all. Arguing against what i said is useless. Soon you will see how my intelligence will enlighten the rest of mankind and bring us to a greater future."
