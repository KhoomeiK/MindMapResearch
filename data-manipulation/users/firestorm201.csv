It just goes to illustrate how fast the speed of light is, that even to approach 3/4ths the speed of it is to seem instantaneous from our perception."
techsupportgore,ff6gb1a,t1_ff6ffaa,1579626572.0,"If by speed of electricity you mean the speed of electromagnetic current through a conductor, it varies (between 50-99% speed of light) depending on the insulating material. 

Note that electrons themselves in a circuit don’t move at this speed, and are actually quite slow (approx 1cm/sec)."

techsupportgore,fdzykru,t1_fdzwf57,1578798947.0,"You’re absolutely right—I once went out with one of our most experienced outside techs to learn about the locate process (do everything on the job once I always say), and we’re locating facilities around power equipment and water mains. I sweep one direction, then sweep another. Then I go in a circle, and do it again. I mark in between the two separate lines I find, assuming that the mark is our cable. I then go over 5 feet and find what I assume were either echos or reflections, of almost the same strength.

techsupportgore,fdz9rq2,t1_fdykss3,1578788041.0,"It’s possible this image in particular is just a demonstration piece, but having worked in telecom for most of my life, I can tell you that this kind of damage happens on the *reg*. In a large city, this amount of cable in a single place would be unusual for how few cables were actually hit. 

You’d be surprised how often companies will put fiber in without even protective conduit (see recent google fiber failure with micro trenching). You’d also be surprised to find that, perhaps like this image is showing, a company might have a “planned redundancy fiber link” in a conduit that is inches away from the main path. 

I knew a company that once laid unprotected fiber directly in the ground in a national forest, and rather than pay extra to protect the fiber with conduit, just dumped the sharp pointy rocks and dirt right back onto the fiber and called it good. Cue Ron Howard, *it was not good*."

They’re truly awesome people."
techsupportgore,fdwk627,t1_fdwhdeg,1578759536.0,"Orange cable is multi-strand fiber. Generally what we would do is we would go back to the closest hand hole, push through any slack (if there is any) and re-splice the cable together, with some conduit patch work. Since this is a pretty common occurrence, we pretty much plan for fiber strikes ahead of time."

buildapc,fcuu3kg,t3_ej1m0t,1577988523.0,"Are you experienced with woodworking at all? I've been contemplating doing something like this myself. I'd recommend figuring out basic dimensions first, of course. Figure out how high you want the table, how much room you want inside the table for parts, and what finishes / look you're going for. Spend some time on Pinterest looking for similar designs that you can use to give you ideas.   


Me personally, I was going to build a desk with wood, use a plexiglass top so that parts would be visible. Perhaps even utilize an infinity mirror concept such that the parts appear to be stacked into infinity. I would either hinge the plexiglass, or build a tray that parts sit on, such that I could easily access them. I figure I could also add fans to the back of the table that could be enabled under high heat conditions."
