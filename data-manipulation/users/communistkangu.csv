Cartalk,fffjmj1,t1_ffeocba,1579885378.0,"I worked at a gas station as a teenager. One night, a dude with a really dirty Ford Mondeo pulled up (looked like he was off-roading this poor thing) and pumped 50-60l. He came in, got some beers, paid and got outside. By the time he was outside the tank must have been already half empty again by the looks of the puddle that built up. I told him that he can't leave, that he has to get rid of this mess (I was alone and couldn't both get rid of the gas and attend to customers) and that he'd have to call a tow truck because he'd destroy the environment with his leak. He said sure I'm just gonna park it right there so I'm not blocking the pump. Of course he drove away. The same evening, on my way home, I saw him at the side of the street waiting for the tow truck. I've never given anyone a dirtier look of satisfaction in my life because he must've already waited for 3 hours, at -8°C."

me_irl,ff76bn9,t1_ff75ar0,1579641981.0,"In Germany, the gas price is *really* high. Changing your speed from 130 km/h to 160 km/h can double the gas consumption, thus doubling the money you have to pay. It's only on rare occasions where you just slam your foot to the metal. The conditions have to be perfect (straight line, no traffic, perfect weather) and you have to have a capable car. Doing 180km/h in a Fiat Punto is scary to say the least. I think it's best compared to owning guns in the US. We know we don't really need it and it's probably stupid but we won't let that right be stripped away from us."
