Therefore, you only need to ""worry"" if there is stuff you don't want someone to hear going on when the device is triggered (intentionally or not) *and* your request is not understood.

I have a job which I would absolutely love if they gave me a chance to do some more training and R&D, but everyone is only as valued as their numbers for the last half, so a short-termist culture prevails and I can't do anything new and exciting for clients.

When I was working under less scrutiny, I found that I could make massive efficiencies in my jobs. I'd have to put in a lot of work up front, since I had to work the inefficient old system and work on ways to make it efficient. Soon I'd start to create a bit of time for myself and it became a virtuous circle, the more time I had, the more time I could invest in making my job more efficient. Then I'd get bored and move on. I found it quite satisfying. I wish I hadn't moved on quite as quickly though and used my freed-up time to learn a new skill which I could have brought to my next project.

I don't need to know the disciplinary process in my organisation on a daily basis, I probably should know it and an HR person may not love walking me through it. I do need to use a computer on a daily basis, so I should understand that if my mouse cursor on the screen is jerky, it might be a problem with the mouse, or the computer. I should know that my mouse is optical, so it's relying on bouncing light, so maybe the surface I'm using it on isn't appropriate, or perhaps the sensor is dirty? No? Well actually the problem is intermittent, it only happens when I run a specific report. Thinking about it, the computer has to do a lot of work to compile that for me, maybe it's not got enough power and it's prioritising the report over my mouse. Let's look at the system resources when I run that report...

None of that is very technical. My reasoning didn't cover exactly how the light from the mouse hits the sensor and is interpreted, or that the system resource that is critical is either the CPU or RAM, not disk space. With a little knowledge and some common sense thinking, I can get a long way to narrowing down my problem and when I do go to IT, I can present the issue and a logical hypothesis as to the cause, rather than, ""My mouse is broken."""
