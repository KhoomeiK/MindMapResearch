MedicalGore,ff5bvwl,t1_ff5bl57,1579586613.0,"Well you are dead set on arguing about the terms with other commenters. I was just curious if you actually worked in the field. 

A lot of people do use the terms interchangeably although that’s not entirely correct to do so"
MedicalGore,ff5bi88,t1_ff598gx,1579586227.0,I didn’t ask for a source describing the difference in terms. I only asked if you were in the medical field.
MedicalGore,ff596qw,t1_ff57d67,1579584006.0,Do you work in the medical field at all?
workingmoms,ff3biu3,t1_ff3ajbe,1579537930.0,"Thank you! 

It’s definitely common. I think a lot of people will realize how toxic their workplace is once they take a medical leave. You sit there and think about going back to work and end up dreading it knowing that you’re coming back into a drama-filled place that you don’t enjoy."
workingmoms,ff39eij,t3_er2cr8,1579536782.0,"Hey, I’m doing the same thing. 

I start work back today. Just finished my maternity leave. And I have a job interview on Wednesday. 

I’m leaving for various reasons, but a lot of it has to do with the environment and drama. (My schedule also sucks. 2nd shift - 6 days a week). Everyone is so excited to have me back because I actually do my job and I stay out of everyone’s business and I’m dreading having to possibly tell them that I’m leaving, but you do what you have to do for yourself and your family. In my case, the job I’m interviewing for is better pay, longer hours in a day but that’ll mean less days a week, and it’s first shift. They also reimburse schooling fees which will mean I can finish my degree. 

Congratulations on the new job. Don’t feel guilty for leaving. You are doing what you need and want."
mildlyinteresting,ff38qgb,t1_ff2qtmq,1579536350.0,"I would much rather have this than the bulk of papers I got at my orientation. I’ve yet to have a job that’s technologically advanced enough to do this or even put it on a website or a document folder to just email to us. 

I think I’d keep up with this better than a stack of papers that inevitably end up lost between my seats in my car or in an old backpack."

medizzy,fes8lwl,t1_feqs5x4,1579362582.0,It’s irritates the hell out of my skin lol. I can’t use it anything that has it
medizzy,feqm86c,t1_feqisqy,1579343541.0,People’s skin can be irritated by anything. Especially a healing incision. You run the risk of irritation and infection by putting Shea butter in the wound. Never put anything on an incision like that unless told otherwise by your doctor
sex,fee8m1y,t1_fedu9ft,1579028646.0,It’s between ages 27 and 45. Not necessarily in your 30s.
AskReddit,fe75i3v,t1_fe6rrut,1578910310.0,I had a lot of issues with my ears as kid and remember having to put straight peroxide in my ears everyday. It’s such a weird feeling
JustNoSO,fdu5kws,t1_fdtrtut,1578727961.0,I could tell my mom was going to try her best to be in the room but I got lucky. My mom and sister stepped out of the room for a few hours so I could sleep since I wasn’t progressing any. 3 hours later and my daughter was out. Nobody had a chance to be in there
sex,fdrfhpw,t1_fdqpzfx,1578683769.0,A woman’s sex drive kicks in in her 30s? Where did you get that information?
sex,fdrf846,t3_emsvtf,1578683667.0,"Do you think maybe it’s a depression issue? You said that you bring her dinner in bed most nights, make all the food, do everything in home. She may be depressed"
insanepeoplefacebook,fdre8fp,t1_fdr4i9i,1578683242.0,"Actually people complain because he’s sitting on more money than he knows what to do with, while also making a shit ton more money while the rest of us get barley anything for the work we do and almost nothing back in taxes even though we pay quite a bit."
insaneparents,fdq6il8,t1_fdq5mb6,1578657006.0,How closed minded are you?
insaneparents,fdq6cvp,t1_fdq3m8r,1578656819.0,I’m also from America and it’s not that weird of an age gap. It’s only a 2 year gap.

coolguides,fdpby5e,t1_fdp2tnc,1578624796.0,"The width of the shoe isn’t the issue though. The bottom of the foot is what hurts. 

My boyfriends feet are so flat and we can’t find a decent pair of shoes that doesn’t hurt him even more"
coolguides,fdo8gv6,t3_emcie9,1578600705.0,What about for flat feet? Is there a guide for that?
AskReddit,fdn29iv,t1_fdmftqi,1578575113.0,My parents took all my electronics for having Cs. I wasn’t allowed to go outside and hang out with my neighbor and I wasn’t allowed to hang out with my sister in the house. Guess who became a hermit after that? I was also basically grounded for 3 years

AskReddit,fdeivvc,t1_fddrajd,1578339977.0,"When I worked in a gas station, I was always 15 minutes early. The one time I was running behind, I got in trouble for it. But another employee who was consistently late never got in trouble."

JustNoSO,fd1wcxu,t1_fczrn8a,1578137839.0,"Congrats! I had my first at the beginning of December. While I was terrified to not have anyone in the room other than my boyfriend, I’m absolutely glad I did it. I think i would’ve been too distracted to have anyone else in there. There’s a lot going on as soon as that baby comes out."
AskReddit,fcw9xsb,t1_fcw88ec,1578020528.0,What part do you not understand?
JustNoSO,fcvfgtp,t1_fctztus,1578000987.0,Please know that you are not the one who fucked up here.
Mommit,fcveil7,t1_fcvdb3c,1578000426.0,"Oh definitely. Things are about to change because I’m at my wits end. I can’t be the only one to clean the house and take care of the baby. 

There’s a learning curve for the both of us and I can’t be the only one to actually learn. He needs to now to make it easier on himself when I start working again."
Mommit,fcv9c6j,t1_fcuxqpz,1577997348.0,"I’m honestly relieved that my SO isn’t the only one that never gets up with the baby. 

We only have a 3 week old and I’m tired of doing it already. 

When my SO is off work, he will stay up until 2-3am playing video games while I’m in bed waking up every 2-4 hours with our little one. There’s been times where I will take him our daughter but it’s like he doesn’t have the patience when she’s in one of her colicky fits."
CasualConversation,fcuijmu,t1_fcug9xw,1577981784.0,I used to always do mine at night. It felt really weird doing it this morning lol
ShitAmericansSay,fctlt18,t1_fcrsqg1,1577948097.0,I remember getting detention and even a call home because I wouldn’t say the pledge of allegiance in elementary school. I was just a very shy kid and hated being heard

YouShouldKnow,fcm2o44,t1_fbxl7ty,1577762655.0,Fairlife is the closest thing I’ve found that tastes like actual milk. I highly recommend it if you don’t mind paying for it. (It can be pricy in some places)
YouShouldKnow,fcm289x,t1_fbxvsv9,1577762323.0,My 3 week old just spits her mucous at you instead of it coming out other ways.
AskReddit,fcli4si,t1_fclgax8,1577748333.0,"You would be correct. 

I also have very sensitive skin and found the only bar soap I can use is dove coconut rose (I think that’s what it is. I know it’s pink and smells amazing - like smell it through the pack and want to melt amazing). My boyfriend uses the dove body wash and it does wonders for him. It all depends on what you prefer but definitely use stuff made for sensitive skin on your nether regions."

sex,fckk59s,t1_fckftm5,1577727092.0,"I’d probably be into it if my boyfriend did it but I would also have to be in the mood. Like if I’m laying in bed looking at my phone, don’t just drop a chair next to me and whip your dick out. I’ll probably just turn over and ignore you. But if you get me interested first - maybe some dirty talk, flirtatious touching, something - then I’d be into it. 

His wife is probably the same way."
Mommit,fckjg4t,t1_fckisd3,1577726659.0,"That sounds about like my situation. Boyfriend works first shift, I work second. We both work full time but he gets weekends off. I only get one weekend a month off"
Mommit,fckamal,t1_fck8tn0,1577720970.0,"The exhaustion is what’s making me think about going back just part time until I’m supposed to actually be back full time. I think if I dip my toe in first it’ll make it easier when I have to dive in. 

I’m a caregiver in a memory care unit so my job can be pretty physically demanding. I’m thinking doing it a couple days a week will help build the muscle back up and it won’t be as rough. I also think it would make it easier leaving my daughter for 8 hours a day 5-6 days a week if I start out slow."
Mommit,fckach9,t1_fck9enb,1577720779.0,"I feel like I would also appreciate the time I spend with her more. It feels like I’m moving through the motions at this point, rather than mentally being there because I’m doing the same thing day in and day out."
Mommit,fcka7iv,t1_fck9j8g,1577720683.0,"If I had the option to be a SAHM or work, I’d probably be a SAHM honestly. But I don’t have that option. I hate that my boyfriend is currently paying for everything and I’m just sitting around. Or so it feels. I do miss working though. I’ve been out of work since I was 36 weeks, so I’ve been out of work for roughly 8 weeks already"
AskReddit,fcj2ofs,t1_fcgzj5m,1577675770.0,Some of what you described sounds just like my boyfriend. He smokes all the time and will complain about not being motivated to do anything and feels like he’s stuck in life and it’ll never get better. I’ve tried talking to him about cutting back on it but he can’t stand how irritable he gets when he hasn’t smoked. I can’t stand it either but I’d rather deal with a couple days of him being an ass just so he can reset himself and be who I know.

sex,fc6hjcm,t1_fc690ko,1577480722.0,"Clitoral stimulation is perfectly fine and safe. As long as nothing is inserted and we keep things clean, then we’re fine. I’m just Looking for more techniques."
CasualConversation,fc68zex,t1_fc5yp5o,1577475028.0,"To piggyback on this: for the love of god don’t get lazy when it comes to cleaning up. I’m not saying you are or that you will but don’t expect her to keep doing that. 

The first time I cleaned my boyfriends apartment, he was extremely grateful and happy. Now we live together and the man doesn’t clean up shit."
YouShouldKnow,fc2o1d1,t1_fc2mtvj,1577368718.0,I also use the arm and hammer baking soda toothpaste. My teeth always felt a little dirty with other toothpastes but this one actually makes my mouth feel clean.
Mommit,fbzgdo1,t1_fbzctp3,1577245797.0,Her doctor suggested that at the 2 month appointment if things don’t get better. We’re in the process of trying different formulas to rule out an allergy. I’m honestly suspecting she has some acid reflux. We started her on a formula for that and sensitive stomachs and so far so good.
Mommit,fbuuc8m,t1_fbut5u2,1577120492.0,"I have. It seems like she’s constantly hungry doing it that way, because I’ll feed her 3oz at each feeding but then she screams and screams until she gets that 1oz and I can get a burp out of her. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. We’re constantly making bottles. 

I was finally given the go ahead to give her an actual bath so we may be trying that tonight. 

And my boyfriend and I will trade off when she gets like that. Sometimes she’s just tired of whoever is holding her and calms down with the next person.

Thank you!"
