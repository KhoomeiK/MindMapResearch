resin,ff6xwhh,t3_ersdex,1579637152.0,That's beautiful. What pigments and technique did you use? I tried doing something like that with mica pigments but it didn't work.

facepalm,feumdd2,t3_eqgbr4,1579387909.0,"I mean, he's not wrong, your not a witness if you didn't witness it. So if you didn't see it you're a false witness."

toastme,fe6qhqn,t1_fe4mxqr,1578900645.0,"I also want to add this. I know you can't trust me cause you don't know me, but consider for a second that what I'm saying is true, cause it is. Depression is happening TO you. Depression is NOT your fault nor all of your shortcomings while you've been in it. I understand depression, I know that demon, and I'm telling you that this is not something that you have caused, but something you've fallen into. You're stuck and in a nasty fog. You can't blame yourself for falling into a pit you didn't know was there."
toastme,fe6prha,t1_fe4mxqr,1578899717.0,"You're in a bad cycle. You're rythm of life is filled with longing and self hate. You need to stop. From the bottom of my heart I can tell you, no one deserves to be treated like you treat yourself(speaking from my own experience of self hate). You might think you deserve to be in this empty pit you fell into, but you don't and the most respectable thing you could do, would be to start being good to yourself. You have to choose between trying at a new life and letting the past go, or keeping your pain until you can't anymore. No more negative self talk, don't allow yourself to tell yourself there's no hope or that you'll feel this way forever, those are downright lies! There are good things you have to practice doing every day, and you'll get better at them over time; stop negative thinking, no living in the past, deciding to live for something, choosing one thing to be thankful for, etc. You've got a lot of bad habits, but this can happen to anybody, you just need some navigation right? I want you to believe that there's a way out of this fog, other than death, cause there always is."
toastme,fe4ghjc,t1_fe47toz,1578859092.0,"Lol, very funny. Thanks. I have moments of happiness. So I guess it's not all completely terrible, it's just a real tough journey. I'm glad you're adding more to the positive side of /toastme!"
toastme,fe471ij,t3_enn6uh,1578856380.0,"Good friends are a gift. I have friends, but I have chronic health issues that include stomach pain almost 24 hours a day that gets worse before and after I eat. My existence is tough. I can't work, can barely do my hobbies. Share some of your happiness with a stranger?"
toastme,fe46mta,t1_fe40cvm,1578856249.0,"I'm not a phsycologist or anything, but do you think it's possible that you keep reliving your pain because you can't move on? You're not willing to accept a new life without her? That you think nothing could ever compare to that time in your life? So you're stuck, living that time over and over in your head cause it's the only true happiness you've ever known? Cause that's some real pain."
toastme,fe44r77,t3_enqn8b,1578855752.0,Parents can suck sometimes. But congrats on the weight gain! I've gained a few pounds I needed myself and I find I'm not so lightheaded anymore! Good job!
