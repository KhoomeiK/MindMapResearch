in my few years of daily usage ive noticed that if i follow up smoking flower with a cigarette about 15 minutes later, i get a more intense high, but my full high lasts about 30 to 45 minutes followed by like an hour of ""kinda high""

but if i just smoke green with no nic and no cigarette afterward, the high feeling is less intense but lasts much longer like over an hour before the afterglow sets in"

i started at 11 years old and did it probably a handful of times until i discovered porn at like 13 or 14

lets say once a week until im 14.

its been basically once a day before bed every day since 14 and im 28 now.

theres of course days where i skip it for various reasons like sickness or whatever but theres also days where i do it a bunch due to boredom and stuff.

but once a day is pretty average for me so we'll use that. 

thats about 5,000 times plus or minus a couple hundred based on my super vague math"
woahdude,ff6uthk,t1_ff68lt1,1579635330.0,"Im in southern US and we had a city wide state of emergency a couple years ago due to ice and snow and fog. 

Zero visibility for two days, ice all over the roads, two feet of snow and all in a city grossly underprepared for winter weather. They didnt salt the roads, the snow plows took days to get to my neighborhood etc

And i almost got fired for a no call no show because the power was out, my phone was dead, and i couldnt leave my culdesac because its about a half mile to the main roads, which were plowed and cleared, but the snow in my culdesace was over the top of my little car's tires.

Im hoping Canada has their shit together a bit better than we do in terms of wage labor because that shit was ridiculous.

They actually tried to fire me for being snowed in. I had to plead my case with human resources and even then they were like ""couldnt you borrow your neighbors phone to call out?"""

AskReddit,ff6iscw,t3_erstu3,1579628096.0,"STORY ABOUT BEING NAKED IN FRONT OF COPS AND MY EX GF

this was about two years ago

Context: i used to have a bit of a substance abuse problem which is totally under control now. I still smoke weed daily but I'm never going back to any of the other stuff i used to do.

It was about 10pm and i was on the phone with mom, who lives on the other side of the country. We had been talking for about two hours (which we do once a week) and my phone ran out of juice but i had the next day off so i wasnt worried about alarms so i just said fuck it, set it on the charger and went to sleep.

i wake up at about 4am to two female (im a guy) police officers with flashlights asking me very loudly if im okay. Less than a second ago i was dead asleep so imagine my confusion as rub my eyes and see my ex girlfriend from years ago crying in the doorway to my bedroom with two police officers shining lights at me while im laying in bed naked as the day i was born and exposed to the world.

Turns out, mom thought i died of an overdose, called my ex (apparently the only number she had saved besides mine)
and then called my local police department for a wellness check.

I ended up having to calm my ex down and convince the police i was okay while halfway covering my dong with my sheets at 4 o clock in the morning

but my ex lives like 4 hours away from me so i couldnt just be like ""yeah im good please leave"" because she drove so far just to see if im alive so she ended up staying the night with me

id love to tell you all we smashed but we didnt, we just went to sleep and she left in the morning after making awkward plans to ""hang out soon""

it was exceptionally rough for her because she had two friends kill themselves in the last few years"

Americas Army was made SPECIFICALLY as propaganda to promote joining the army

they literally made a game to recruit people

its the intent thats tripping me up

as opposed to GTA which was made to just be a fun game, this one was actually a way to convince people like ""hm killing folks in this game sure is fun i should join the army"""

For those out of the loop, basically its a short, violent hallucination (either visual or auditory or even physical) that happens right before you fall asleep. like right on the cusp.

But before i knew what it was i thought my house was haunted. 

Imagine falling asleep and right as your thoughts start to get all weird and you kinda start imagining the beginnings of a dream, you feel someone grab your shoulders and yell ""YO"" super deep and louder than you thought possible. You wake up instantly and look around but it was all in your head."
