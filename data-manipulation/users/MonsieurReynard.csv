Instant revelation: quieter and smoother and much better handling by miles. Still yes a 2017 3 is after they added a lot of sound deadening and it helped. The 6 got quieter too.

That had a full sized analog tach right in the middle and speedo off to the side. It also had a really wonky heads up display and a boneheaded I-ELOOP thing, but those are small issues.

personalfinance,feylr1a,t3_eqly3u,1579447296.0,"Wow. So he’s paid roughly 48,000 bucks (4 years x 500 a month) on this car and is 15k upside down? And nowhere near paying it off? How long is the loan for? 

Let me guess: it’s German.

I hang out on an economy car brand sub a lot and every day young people post bragging that they are getting a new car for “only” whatever payment amount they agreed to. For 6 years. When the car is guaranteed to lose 20% of its value in two years, 50% in 5. 

Then they post a few years later with this exact story: underwater, payments are killing them, they really want a new car, the dealer is willing to “upgrade them for the same payment” and is this a good idea.... HELL NO! You’re repeating the exact same mistake and buying new car depreciation at full price and signing yourself up for a brand new cycle of sinking even further underwater.  Unless you know you have an inheritance or a big salary increase coming, this is nuts. And if you don’t have a) a robust emergency fund and b) a rigorous savings program where you’re saving 15-20% of your income as a young person in retirement funds or towards real estate ownership (or for an education that will raise your salary) you should be driving a beater or a hand me down. 

Being able to “afford a payment” is not the same thing as being able to afford a car. In my view, you should only buy a car you can afford to buy in cash, even if you do choose to finance it. No one who isn’t set for retirement savings and college savings etc. should even consider a brand new car, not even a cheap one. That first 20% hit when you drive off the lot is a huge price to pay for a nice smelling interior that lasts 3 months.

Convincing a young man he should drive a shitty car when he has cash coming in is hard work. But it’s how you wind up well off. Let’s say he had paid cash for a $10,000 car four years ago. Likely it would be on the road and solid today. And he would have had $40,000 or more (he’s paying $200 a month in insurance which means that’s an insanely fancy car or he’s a really shitty driver, an old beater doesn’t need comprehensive and collision and can be insured for much less)  invested toward a down payment on a house or retirement, which if he’s under 35 or so is like half a million bucks or more at 65 if invested at average rates of return. 

Think about it. Cars are depreciating assets and functional tools. If you’re wealthy and have fun money to burn they can be toys and status symbols. But if you can’t afford the long term burn, and end up underwater, ain’t no one gonna be impressed at your broke ass in a Beemer."

Because you’re talking about a $30k PLUS Mazda3, one that might be worth $14k now if the mileage is low and the condition is pristine. 

Bro, don’t take on your dad’s mistake. Just buy a used car. You’re young. Cars cost several thousand bucks a year to own no matter what you buy. But you don’t need to spend $6-7k plus almost as much in depreciation loss. why would you take over an underwater loan or get yourself into yet another underwater loan with rolled over negative equity on a rapidly depreciating commodity car? 

You need to get familiar with /r/personalfinance .... that sub is full of people who got in real deep holes thinking like you’re thinking. I don’t blame you because it clearly runs in the family. 

You should really only buy a car in cash or, if you finance it, at a rate so low you can do better putting that cash into an actual investment. Doubly so for a young person. Buy a shitbox NA for $2000 cash, learn how to work on it, save your money for a couple of years, and buy a nicer used ND in 5-6 years with the cash you saved, minus what you invested in either education or retirement or real estate."

Go find one review anywhere by anyone that compares the Accord in any trim level to the comparable Mazda 6 and concludes that the Accord is “trash” by comparison. Actually, most of the major comparison reviews give the Accord the edge, certainly for performance on top trim. For one thing you can get the turbo with a manual transmission, which you can’t on a 6.  Even the auto is a 10 speed rather than Mazda’s aging 6. Most reviewers do credit the Mazda interior as better, but it has significantly less space, as well as being a notch slower. 

Anyway both of them are smoked by a v6 Camry. 

Making a car brand into a religion is childish. If Mazda really made far superior cars to Honda, let alone better performing ones, across the board and consistently, the market would notice. Mazda can hardly give away 6s right now. Meanwhile Hyundai is lapping everyone with both a hot sport hatchback and a redesigned and more upscale  Sonata that looks sharp and has identical specs to a Mazda6 for less $. 

Hondas are not “trash” compared to Mazdas. Your hot take is wrong."

mazda,fek939n,t1_fek1x9e,1579195163.0,The 2018 V6 Accord did not “drive like a pig.” Ive put many California mountain miles on one in my family and it’s an absolute beast. Handles amazingly. Power that doesn’t quit. Smooth as silk.
mazda,fek8uba,t1_fejzhsh,1579195017.0,"My Cuz has the last year of the V6 accord, 2018 I think. 

That car spanks the ass of any modern Mazda. It’s almost terrifyingly willing to get off the line and it handles amazingly. It sounds great, and smooth. And with a manual transmission it’s close to being a sports car in sheep’s clothing, stock. Granted Honda no longer makes the V6, but the turbo 4 Accord is a damn quick car for the class and also definitely feels sportier than w turbo Mazda6 to drive. 

I don’t get why trashing Honda makes Mazda look better. Honda has figured out how to sell a lot of cars while maintaining some truly fun options and manual transmissions in several key segments. Their interiors are not really less luxurious than Mazda’s either at higher trim levels. They’ve had more reliability issues and design miscues in the last few years than Honda of old, but Mazda could only benefit from making a 3 that could compete with a $25k Civic Si. That’s all many of us are asking for: a compact with a turbo and a stick shift. If Toyota and Hyundai and VW and Honda can all do it, and keep it well under $30k, what’s the objection to competing in that space for Mazda? THEY HAVE THE MOTOR ALREADY. 

I am a loyal Mazda3 driver and have always been a Mazda buff. But I’m closing in on replacing my 2014 and Honda, Hyundai, VW, and Toyota all offer me something that seems *more* fun and just as useful and efficient as the current 3. In many cases for less money."

Second, CArFax is overrated. It’s been shown by many critics, including Consumer Reports I believe, that those reports often and typically are inaccurate and that many accidents are never reported to them. 

Third, the only way to be close to sure about a used car of unknown provenance where you don’t have complete trust in the seller and a complete record of service since the car was new is to pay for a Prepurchase Inspection by a qualified mechanic. Period. CarFax is useless by comparison. 

A seller doesn’t have to provide a CarFax report, that’s on you.

Let me tell you a story ....

I bought a brand new 2014 iGT Mazda3. Within months my starts were weak. And leaving the accessories on for 10 minutes to listen to the radio would kill it and require a jump from a battery pack I got in the habit of keeping fully charged and in my car. I complained to my dealer — I was under warranty of course and came back in for oil changes back then because they’d send you a coupon for $30 full synth oil changes so they could get you in to upsell you more stuff or see if they could “upgrade” you even if you’d just bought a new car from them, so obnoxious  — and they tested it and said it was fine. Finally it was happening every few days. Finally convinced them to replace it with OEM under warranty. They do it. It works great for a few weeks.  Lights brighter, starts faster. Then winter hits — I’m in New England — and it starts to fade fast. Ok back to worrying about whether my jump start battery back is charged whenever I go out. I go back to the dealer (who by then had screwed up another couple of basic things, like the oil change where they sprayed oil all over my engine bay and then tried to spray wash it without telling me, and my car smelled like oil for a month). So I’d stopped using them for service. But I wanted to be on record about the battery thing for warranty purposes with the dealer who sold me the car. (And to whom I would never, ever return in a million years, even if they offered me a free MX-5 hardtop RF,  hear that Mazda? They’re f’ing clowns and crooks.)

So eventually they break down and despite telling me my battery tests just fine, and my alternator is fine, and they don’t know what I could be talking about, they give me a new OEM battery, the THIRD one for my just over two year old car. Lol whut. Winter comes back around, and boom, back to weak starts, dim lights, using the electric windows making the cabin lights dim noticeably, and being afraid to listen to the radio for five minutes after shutting off the motor. Like what the actual fuck? Three batteries, two freshly installed by a dealer shop, all bad in less than one year, and never good. I still had warranty time left and the replacement batteries had their own warranties of course, but by then I was so over my dealer (and yep, another local dealer shop that managed to lie to me to my face) that I went to fuxking AutoZone, bought a Bosch AGM for $110, installed it in the parking lot in 10 minutes, and almost THREE YEARS LATER my car starts like a champ, has bright headlights, and has never again needed a jump start or a trickle charger. It’s sitting outside right now in 20 degree snow and ice and raring to go for a ride on her Blizzaks. (My tire saga is another story, I wound up using Pirellis most of the year and love them...also went to much better than OEM ceramic brakes. Worth it.) 

Moral of the story: when you buy a new Mazda skip the key fob warranty or whatever other pure D bullshit they try to add on to your tab in the finance office and set aside $110 for a Bosch AGM battery at AutoZone on your way home from the dealer. Then when you go back for your first recall (and you will!) bring the old battery back for them to recycle.

Now I have two separate independent mechanic shops (I live in two places) I trust and who charge much less and use better parts than my dealer shops ever did, and also don’t lie to me or hide mistakes from me or recommend things I know for a fact I don’t need while missing important thing I do. I do a lot of my own basic stuff too, but doubt I’ll need to put in my own battery again any time soon. She turns over first time at 10 below."

mazda,fdb3k0s,t1_fd3baeb,1578253302.0,"I have never in my life had to “replace a fender” as a routine expense on an otherwise solid car  That’s could only be necessary in accidents or from rust damage, and I thought Mazda had the scarlet letter of wheel well rust solved in the last decade? In an accident, you’ll still be replacing fenders.  And these aren’t big enough to prevent all paint scratches on fenders, just some of them. 

Also, plastic cladding doesn’t prevent rust. It actually traps moisture against the metal, as we northerners will start to discover on all the plastic wrapped cars in another 5-7 years.   What stops rust is fully galvanized steel, as Mazda took years longer to admit than most competitors, and good quality paint, which based on my 2014 is still not Mazda’s thing. 

I’ve owned a few rusted Mazdas in my life. My no-plastic-cladding 2014 Mazda3 has almost zero rust and I live in northern New England, brother. I’m actually impressed. 

These plastic things are cosmetic, not functional, no matter what anyone says. They’re useful for off-roading where you run through branches. 90% or more of these will never leave pavement.  They look like a Subaru Crosstek. That’s the point. Except the comically small wheels on this are a total fail."
mazda,fdb22j2,t1_fd46nt8,1578252846.0,"Aren’t you clever?

No I won’t be buying this car. Because it’s fugly.

I’m perfectly entitled to comment on its appearance whether I buy it or not.  Many comments on this thread do so, but I guess it’s ok when they’re positive comments? And this group has thousands of comments about Mazda models look visually or in terms of design aesthetics from people who do not own and aren’t planning to buy the model in question.

If you find a vintage RX7 beautiful, who cares about your opinion since you obviously don’t have to buy one?

I own and quite like a 4 year old Mazda3, bought new. I’m a guy who buys a new Japanese car every 5-7 years, in cash. If Mazda prefers not to hear my opinion, they must not care about my business. If you don’t, you have an equally simple option to the one you proposed to me: don’t read my comments.

This is a super generic and bland offering chasing middlebrow market share for lifted economy hatchbacks. It looks much worse to me than the 3 it’s based on, and which I own. From everything I’ve read it’s a snooze to drive too. If I wanted a Subie Crosstek that was already available and looks better.

Optional plastic cladding would be fine. I bet few would buy it."

mazda,fd31zgl,t1_fd1aawf,1578153974.0,They ought to consider making it so you can see behind you.
mazda,fd31pzh,t1_fd1aawf,1578153880.0,And the competition got better in the meantime.

mazda,fd30zwl,t3_ejs42d,1578153750.0,How’s that happen? Glad you’re all ok.
mazda,fd30los,t1_fd2xjwt,1578153618.0,"So to avoid scratching my pretty paint where no one looks at it closely anyway I just get ugly plastic. That way I won’t be let down by my paint. 

Look, man, we have steak but if you eat it you’ll only wish it was bette steak so here have a veggie burger and you won’t feel disappointed. Just numb."
mazda,fd308b4,t3_ejx4f3,1578153476.0,"Wheels look ridiculous.  Maybe if they went to 18 or 19” rims it might not be so stupid.

I hate that cladding. Ruins many nice cars. Looks like shit in 3-5 years. And is used on cars that rarely go anywhere near even a gravel road."
mazda,fczd9uh,t3_ejorhf,1578098622.0,"It’s actually a fairly precise bit of business. Especially if you have LED headlights. I’d take it back to the body shop, where they have a machine for this (or at least a marked wall) and point out that it’s a significant safety liability if they give you any grief. They didn’t finish the job.

It’s definitely unsafe both for you and for other drivers you may be blinding. I would not drive at night until you’ve got it fixed."
mazda,fcy21ix,t1_fcwrxf0,1578073700.0,"The most important missing piece of Mazda’s “upmarket” move is the shitty shoddy dealer network, the lowball junior sales force and the emphasis on moving metal with financing deals. I’ve had nothing but bad experiences with Mazda dealers despite loving the cars.

And Mazda knows this. BMW customers won’t tolerate the atmosphere of many Mazda shops."

nottheonion,fcvuuf1,t1_fcvktx6,1578010613.0,Of Republican politics I think.
nottheonion,fcvus4s,t1_fcvtdmk,1578010572.0,"Because way more than half the time these stories are about republicans, who tend to moralize and preach about their religion and their values and their homophobia and the rule of law and abstinence and not helping addicts with health care or treatment programs — and who wind being caught doing meth with an underage boy or yeah, driving drunk. 

Because it usually is a Republican. It’s the loudly preaching Pharisees you gotta know are projecting all the damn time. 

Betcha he opposes legal weed too.

Rules for thee but not for me should be the GOP slogan."

mazda,fcqbwu4,t1_fck7ee0,1577882956.0,"You’re under warranty so why bother asking a room full of strangers who can’t examine your car? Take it to your dealer, describe the symptoms, and even if they find nothing you create a record of the issue if something goes bad later.

But I’m virtually certain you’re overthinking this and your car is perfectly fine. Unless you’ve been hitting curbs and bad potholes or driving it off-road on the regular the odds of a suspension problem at 35k are pretty damn low."
mazda,fcqbrlt,t1_fciyf20,1577882878.0,"There is basically zero chance your motor mounts or suspension bushings are worn out at 35k unless you’ve been off roading for many of those miles. Zero.  Older mAzda3s are notorious for bad/failing engine mounts but they solved this issue in 2011 or so.

You’re fine. This is normal."

mazda,fcqb7vw,t3_eia0jr,1577882565.0,"There’s a reason you can’t do it in software. That reason is that seat belts are the single most important variable in whether you’re injured or killed or survive in a collision. 

Defeating the seat belt is an amateur move."
mazda,fcq99qq,t1_fcnavu6,1577881429.0,"It is only because people never read the fine print on these things. First year lack of problems is all this survey shows. Period.

Mazdas have gotten more reliable by far over the last 10-15 years and they were never terrible except for rust issues. I am a confident Mazda owner. But that study is being used to trumpet an exaggerated conclusion. Mazda does not yet have Toyota levels of reliability (or slow depreciation) across its lineup."
mazda,fcn7j61,t1_fcil57b,1577805305.0,Just FYI you can add decent aftermarket fog lights for around $100 if you know how to use a screwdriver. Beats the heck out of paying Mazda stealerships $500 for the same Chinese plastic parts.
mazda,fcn7dl7,t1_fcajoeh,1577805191.0,"In one consumer reports survey of brand new car owners Mazda places behind Lexus and ahead of Toyota. That’s based on owner complaints about brand new cars. And the biggest complaint area is infotainment systems across all models surveyed.

I’m cracking up watching folks spin that up into “Mazda is more reliable than Toyota now.” No, not really. Mazdas are solid an reliable of course. My 2014 3 has 80k. No problems. But that CR survey is one small data point and is not a measure of long term overall mechanical reliability across multiple model years. It means new CX-5 owners complained less about their infotainment system than new RAV4 owners, really. Look at the methodology and the numbers."
