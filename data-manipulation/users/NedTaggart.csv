This concept is what I meant when I said that you may want to look into why you are willing to live with an abusive relationship. 

If you aren't happy with it, then you need to make positive moves toward getting out from under it. I refuse to believe that any but a small percentage of people are actually stuck in minimum wage jobs independent of some self-determining factors."
QuotesPorn,ffn6bgl,t1_ffmfgrg,1580062494.0,"I never said this is the fault of poor people. In fact, I was very careful to word this as directed towards a hypothetical individual rather than a group. 

If what you took from what I said is that ""*it’s poor peoples fault*"", then you are injecting your own biases into what you read. So I will ask...why do you blame this on poor people?"
QuotesPorn,ffmcr7v,t1_ffm2agp,1580052494.0,"Minimum wage is a starting point, not a lifestyle. You aren't supposed to stay there. If you are still making minimum wage after a year on the job, you need to do some self reflection, because it is either an issue with your performance and reliability or the fact that you are willing to live with an abusive relationship. Both of those issues are ones that would need to be addressed for you to improve your lifestyle. 

You can respond that there are some people with no choice, that they are stuck and unable to find anything better because of location and job availability. I say that while that may be true in some cases, that is a very VERY minuscule part of the  population. In general if you are at a point where you are entering your second year of making minimum wage, your situation is far more likely to be the cause of poor choices. 

Furthermore, if you are making minimum wage, you need to be working with other people making minimum wage and go in on rent, utilities and food together. This is the part I have never understood. In order to support a living wage, this would require government subsidies in order to keep inflation from running rampant. Those subsidies have to come from taxation. If you are willing to accept money from a collective, then why not make is a voluntary collective of a few people pitching in together to make their lives better rather than legislate it?"

Discharge date came and there was a bit of a delay.  What we knew that he didn't know is that his wife had packed up his kids and moved out while he was in the hospital. They moved across the state to a completely different city. His dad had flown in to pick him up from the hospital. 

The thing is, this guy had hit bottom in his head. He didn't think about the consequences of his behavior. We couldn't tell him what was happening, but it was really uncomfortable watching him walk out and seeing the surprise and confusion on his face when his dad picked him up instead of his wife.

Honestly, I would explain it to them and draw a line in the sand that when the conversation approaches  certain topics, you are allowed to stay stop or allowed to remove yourself from it.

Example: they come in complaining about a shitty day where their presentation didnt get selected. This leads to them saying they are worthless and no one cares about them.

Line in the sand could be ""I'm not going to participate in discussions about your feelings of no self worth""

That still allows you to empathize with then for having a shitty day, and allows for you to support them through the disappointment  of not having their presentation received. Those are natural things to be bummed about. When they then turn it on them being useless, you can say nope, not gonna do it.

Make it a free class if you have to but lack of understanding on what you are signing is as big of a problem as the cost of an education. 

Furthermore, interest rates and availability of student loans needs to be tied to job market availability projections over the next 10 years.

Finally, college is overrated and not for everyone. You can usually tell by 10th grade whether college is a real path for a kid.
