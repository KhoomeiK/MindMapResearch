AskReddit,ffan7vq,t3_esk28l,1579739910.0,"Worked at a place that delivered until 4am on weekends (and 2am on weekdays) so the customer standard was shitfaced. Celebrity shots (to drunk people the pizza guy is a celebrity legitimately) were common place and it you came back after shift (as demanded by the booze gods) were greeted with total confusion or like royalty. People being asleep when you showed up was regular especially this one lady that would fall asleep on the floor in view through the glass doors. Sometimes she would wake up without getting up and instruct you inside (wasn't supposed to) and then coach you through locating her payment in her purse (reaaaally shouldn't have, but alas am dumb.) Really lucky for her I wasn't a predator and lucky for me that nothing came of it. Tons of people would tip in weed, but despite wanting to hear it no girl wanted to offer alternate payment although I dated more in those years than any others."

Second. She isn't a ""C list"" celebrity. It's again just another way to be a dick that someone invented as if we didn't have enough labels, but a ""C list"" celebrity is someone like Paris Hilton. Someone that is famous for being famous.

It isn't friends (1m per episode) money, but you are knocking her for ""just a cable show"" as if worthy of shaming. Tons of actors choose TV over blockbuster films. They don't have insane on location shoots all over the world. Production isn't at full throttle because it costs a billion dollars to have so many high profile people in the same room for more than an hour. They get to explore a character far more in depth and as far as I am concerned no actor in a movie has embodied a character as fully as one who plays one for an extended period on a well produced and written show (Bryan Crandron as Walter White for instance). Production values have also skyrocketed to the point that you don't have to sacrifice the same things you did even 10-20 years ago. This is the golden age of television.

The extended release version would be oxycontin which doesn't have acetaminophen in it like percocet. (Percocet 7.5mg  would be 7.5mg oxycodone/325mg acetaminophen) Most addicts would OD on the acetaminophen (tylenol) before they were satisfied. You happen to take a benzo as well?

I think less than 2 ounces is a class b misdemeanor in non-legal states with no medical marijuana. Of course if there is a stack of bags your friend may very well get fucked with intent to distribute (and hopefully not enough is around to escalate it to trafficking which can happen scary easily with pills.) Be smart and it won't be an issue. Hide it, but don't get caught actively doing so.

If your friend is hotboxing while swerving on the highway at 3am and a cloud of smoke reminiscent of Fast Times at Ridgemont High flows out when rolling the window down for this hypothetical police encounter he is likely more fucked from the DUI/DWI + reckless than a bag of weed.

The superiority complex and condescension are nauseating. You have no idea what you're talking about which makes it even worse. Your argument seems to be that quintupling the assets of ""the poors"" would serve no purpose as they are too dumb to know what to do with means that exceeded the expenses required for their immediate survival. Money management, the bullshit kind you're referring to in this thread I mean, isn't something people have a lot of time for when they are barely getting by. $0.79 in the bank account with a $600 check coming Friday and $1300 in rent due. Welp, looks like they're going to be eating that late payment fee on the rent so thats an extra $100+ gone. Uh oh! Flat tire/phone fell in toilet/little timmy broke his arm. The deficit is snowballing and they're completely fucked. Being poor is expensive. I have seen people have to call out from work as they didn't have the gas to get there. Granting the lower echelon of society that you view as unworthy a modicum of security to build from could yield  so much.

Power consumption is just bonkers. Few cables without blue buff and you're on foot for a long while. Even perfectly efficient fanny play in brawl you run out of energy nearly instantly. 

Then the amount of abilities that flat out shut fannys kit down is far too great. Zilongs spear flip, franco's suppression, and khufra bounce just to name a few. You may as well just afk when playing fanny vs anyone that has an instant disable that cannot miss. 

If she is to be stopped in her tracks instantly by brainless instant disables then reduce energy costs or if energy costs are to remain so high that cables are equivalent to ultimates practically she needs to be immune


Look at Martis s2. When using that series of strikes he is immune to disable. How can you reconcile things like this? I know people hate fanny because 1) she is hard and they fail horribly at her and/or 2) they have been destroyed by a good fanny, but has poor fanny not suffered enough?"

1) all in means you're going until they or you are dead. You aren't going to try to escape. 

2) building off of 1, no attack = no lifesteal. As soon as you stop hitting things and try to turn tail and run you're just going to flop over in a few seconds.

3) alucard is super strong when he is able to attack, as such the other team is strongly incentivized to keep him from just teeing off on them. Thus picking WHEN to engage is of the utmost importance. If you're alone and leap onto franco, nana, and terizla you aren't going to have a great time. 

4) in my opinion purify is essential on alucard due to 1,2, and 3. Purify won't work on franco or kajas ultimates as they are suppression. HOWEVER if you want to ball out of control yolo status you can attempt to predict the timing of their ult and use purify right before they ult and it will block it. Diggie is also your O.G. ride or die homie.

5) alucard is one of the heros you can acquire early with tickets and as such he is the first fighter many people play. Noble Alucard sacrifices his reputation in order to allow noob players to grow and learn."
