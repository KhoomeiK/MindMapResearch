prochoice,ffgfjvi,t1_ffg2k7b,1579905103.0,"I mean, where are the marches condemning those who go to work on Sunday, cheat on their spouse, don’t respect their parents, steal/damage other people’s property, lie to their neighbor or covet things their neighbor has?  They are nowhere because no one has the right to be judge jury and executioner on how another person lives their life."
prochoice,fffh50x,t3_etahwk,1579883847.0,"Why is everyone so obsessed with what women do with their bodies?  Unless they are the father, it literally does not affect their life at all.  Seeing things like this makes me angry.  How would they feel if I started a movement rallying against their right to practice their religion, bear arms or seek medical care?  A prolifer might say pregnancy no matter the circumstance is God’s will.  If that’s true, they better not take any medication to help their blood pressure, diabetes, erectile dysfunction, anxiety, depression or any other medical condition they might have...  I could go on.  I mean damn.  I’m not saying that medical conditions don’t require medication.  I’m saying their God’s will logic only seems to apply situations they deem appropriate."
