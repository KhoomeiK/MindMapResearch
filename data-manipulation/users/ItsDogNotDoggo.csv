Seriously man this is public information that takes 3 minutes to find.

No, they are actually pretty accurate. You just don't like fact. 

Like the fact that Trump did indeed use the power of the office to attempt to extort dirt from a foreign country on a political opponent. 

Why does it take a few contrived abstractions in a email to convince you of a pedophile ring in a pizza parlor or that a president isn't natural born American, yet you ignore mounds of evidence that corruption is happening with your support and approval? 

I don't think you have an interest in fact, you have an interest in personal righteousness.

You have no intention of listening to anything anyone says unless it's ""best president ever"" that much is abundantly clear. 


>Should I pay so they can never represent my views? 

News isn't for representing your views. That's where opinion comes in, if your view is ""Trump is perfect and has never done anything wrong in his life or ever lied"" then I'm afraid your frustrations will not be sated, it's just not the case. 


>If they want tax money they should be impartial.

Show me a news article, not a show on the radio, that isn't impartial. Also, NPR does not receive any direct federal funding, it does receive a small number of competitive grants from CPB and federal agencies like the Department of Education and the Department of Commerce. This funding amounts to approximately 2% of NPR's overall revenues. It is vastly listener funded.
