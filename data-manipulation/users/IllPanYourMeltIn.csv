AskReddit,ffcfj4y,t1_ffc6x7y,1579798363.0,"I used to feel a similar way. The only advice I can give is to take things as they come. When you're so good at your job it's easy to be resentful of the fire fighting you need to do when you come back from a break, or to see other people messing stuff up. I actually found it easier to deal with when I finally accepted that my job isn't my job, my job is to do whatever needs to be done to keep things moving smoothly. If I show up and can't do my ""usual work"" because I need to fix someone else's mistake I don't get upset about that, I just let go of what I was planning on doing and make the other thing the new priority. If the other thing isn't a priority then I just let people know that. Sometimes people just need to learn to deal with their own problems."

unitedkingdom,fex3nbz,t1_feuwc0s,1579423751.0,"They reported that in the news, I've never heard a statement from the guy in question saying that so I doubt it's veracity personally. It wouldn't be the first time a vegan has been painted as a crazy hippy extremist. The same guy who reported that on ITV news was also saying that vegans working in supermarkets would be legally allowed to refuse to ring up animal products. I don't think this even remotely represents the majoity of vegans attitudes, and it's also nowhere near as simple as he's making it out. His whole segment seemed to be trying to paint veganism in a negative light."
unitedkingdom,fex2hsb,t1_fev658z,1579423231.0,"Just want to say - not all are concerned. I consider myself an ethical vegan, but I'm also a pragmatist. If the options are that BK has a vegan burger (cooked on the same grill as meat) or no vegan burger at all, then I'm in favour of the vegan burger. I can see how it's a step in the right direction and might help non vegans make the jump, which in the long term helps achieve my goal of minimising animal suffering. 

Also for me personally it wouldn't disgust me to eat something that might have cross contaminated. I think the way the animals are treated are disgusting, and I don't find meat as appetising as I used to, but a tiny bit of grease isn't going to have any kind of meaningful flavour profile that I'd be able to pick out amongst the other flavours so it's really easy to not even think about. 

There's a lot of differing opinions on this within the community."

asoiaf,fegrpdp,t1_feg74pe,1579100975.0,"""Ser? My lady?"" said Podrick. ""Is a broken man an outlaw?""

""More or less,"" Brienne answered.

Septon Meribald disagreed. ""More less than more. There are many sorts of outlaws, just as there are many sorts of birds. A sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord. They are evil men, driven by greed, soured by malice, despising the gods and caring only for themselves. Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide. Brothers march with brothers, sons with fathers, friends with friends. They've heard the songs and stories, so they go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure, the greatest most of them will ever know.

""Then they get a taste of battle.

""For some, that one taste is enough to break them. Others go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in his hundred-and-first. Brothers watch their brothers die, fathers lose their sons, friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after they've been gutted by an axe.

""They see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his now. They take a wound, and when that's still half-healed they take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water.

""If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands they're fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there it's just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They don't know where they are or how to get back home and the lord they're fighting for does not know their names, yet here he comes, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the world . . .

""And the man breaks.

""He turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours. The broken man lives from day to day, from meal to meal, more beast than man. Lady Brienne is not wrong. In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear them . . . but he should pity them as well.""

When Meribald was finished a profound silence fell upon their little band. Brienne could hear the wind rustling through a clump of pussywillows, and farther off the faint cry of a loon. She could hear Dog panting softly as he loped along beside the septon and his donkey, tongue lolling from his mouth. The quiet stretched and stretched, until finally she said, ""How old were you when they marched you off to war?""

""Why, no older than your boy,"" Meribald replied. ""Too young for such, in truth, but my brothers were all going, and I would not be left behind. Willam said I could be his squire, though Will was no knight, only a potboy armed with a kitchen knife he'd stolen from the inn. He died upon the Stepstones, and never struck a blow. It was fever did for him, and for my brother Robin. Owen died from a mace that split his head apart, and his friend Jon Pox was hanged for rape.""

""The War of the Ninepenny Kings?"" asked Hyle Hunt.

""So they called it, though I never saw a king, nor earned a penny. It was a war, though. That it was."""
TumblrInAction,feg80sa,t1_feg6mc7,1579081416.0,Not my area of expertise but it seems like you could split it into a few smaller diagrams showing mutually exclusive forms of open relationship rather than having to torture the Venn diagram format so that it all fits in one image.

vegancirclejerk,fe6rgxx,t1_fe5uucc,1578901916.0,"There's a great book that you might find helpful, it's called ""Beyond Beliefs"" by Melanie Joy and breaks down ways to communicate effectively in a relationship between vegans and ~~bloodmouths~~ ~~carnists~~ non-vegans so that both sides feel respected. I don't know your wife or her specific reasons for not going vegan but for many people it's almost like a dig in reaction not to do something because people are telling you you should. Maybe if you both read the book you'll understand each other a bit better and she might be more receptive to changing."
trashy,fdsbtfo,t1_fds7plz,1578699005.0,Animal agriculture uses shit tonnes of water and energy dude. You need to consider the water used to grow the animals food.

sports,fdqtt45,t1_fdqnp0n,1578674728.0,I bet white people during the segregation era thought they had the freedom to go out to eat without having to sit next a black person. People doing sit ins were breaking the law and upsetting people and faced consequences for it. This is what peaceful protest is about. You do something innocuous but which nevertheless disrupts the norm so that when you're punished for it people are forced to question why.

eupersonalfinance,fc70ugr,t1_fc6u6p3,1577494530.0,"The answer to your last question is because in theory if everyone has access to a social safety net then everyone benefits. If the poorest people still have access to the basic necessities then crime isn't as big a problem, people are happier and healthier and the social fabric is tighter knit. It doesn't always work out as planned but that is the idea. 


Another aspect to consider is that those who earn more have benefited partially from the provision of those services and as thanks it's expected that you pay for their continuation. To benefit but then refuse to pay for social services can be seen as ""pulling the ladder up behind them""."
