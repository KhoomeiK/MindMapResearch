nihilism,fgkuwh3,t1_fgkmwm0,1580874154.0,"Because arrogance often leads to unnecessary suffering and that brand of arrogance has been doing so for quite some time. Because someone's meaning, that they essentially have no legitimate basis for but an adult version of 'make believe', becomes a political tool to cause such suffering. And it all starts with arrogance. But in 'the grand scheme of the universe' maybe all that is insignificant.

CasualConversation,fgiuk4y,t3_eyr253,1580831228.0,"I know what you're going through....it is so obnoxious when someone feels the need to mention someone's low sociability while in a group of people. It is completely useless and just makes a situation awkward. I was made pretty insecure about it and tried to remedy  it but it is damn awful feeling like you are supposed to speak when you have nothing to say. It makes things even more awkward when you become a real-time observer of your own self instead of just going with your flow. I am so turned off by most social situations these days and often times feign partial deafness or just completely check out. I'm sure many people think I am rude...but it's kinda rude and entitled of most people to assume I must be focused and interested in their petty insignificant dribble and gossip. 

Silence is golden, but so many people would rather have their lives gilded with trivial babble so they don't have to occupy the moments of silence with thought. Just be yourself and don't pay the fools much mind. And don't become a bitter ass like me. Try to make light of it with a joke"

 I think the internet is a way for people to blow off some steam and let go of anger they feel they cannot express in any other social interaction without damaging their reputation. So, with the results of anonymity in mind, I don't really understand why people take too much seriously from anonymous people on the internet. Positive and negative.

While the pastry-papa was discovered after the sugar-daddy, it is not an evolution of the sugar-daddy, but rather a newly recognized symbiotic relationship. Now, both are within the order of 'glucose-guardians' ,however, the benefits of the pastry-papa relationship are more wholesome than the sugar-daddy. 

A papa is indubitably a good man who cares primarily for the well-being and happiness of said 'benefactor of the pastry'. Now while this may be true of a sugar-daddy, there is no denying that there is a sexual component which is the primary motivation of the daddy in giving away his sugar. Also the daddy's foundation is in the exploitation of 'daddy issues'. Nobody in the world has ever had 'papa issues'.  

This has led some to speculate that this pastry-papa is a victim of a parasitic relationship, because the papa isn't receiving anything in return. This is due to shallow investigation by cynical researchers who are unable to understand the joy and fulfillment the papa feels in companionship and ensuring the well being of his friend."
