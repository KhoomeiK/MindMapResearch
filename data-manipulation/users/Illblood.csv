TooAfraidToAsk,fd39zei,t3_ejrgje,1578156198.0,"So happy to see other people have this problem. I find myself reading a sentence up to 3 times just to figure out what it means.

Lots of authors are such deep writers that it's impossible for me to follow, for example I reas the myth of sisyphus of Albert Camus and I could follow maybe every other 3 sentences... idk if I have one with a bad translation but it's rough for me. 

I don't think we're stupid, I just think learning to read how an author writes is a skill. They're very good at giving meaning to each word and sentence so it takes time to digest these for us. I reas pretty fast but I realized it means nothing and found it much more satisfying to take my time with each page."
