I don’t know why but I ended up buying him a beer and gave him some words of encouragement when I handed it to him. He tried to hide it but he had tears in his eyes. 

I ended up sitting next to him and bullshitting with him for awhile about life, his problems and just general inspiring shit. At the end of the conversation he told me that he had thought about taking his life that night. By the time we parted ways he had a completely different demeanor and told me that the next time we meet the beers were on him.

rant,ff9200a,t1_ff8zu5m,1579702869.0,"Na what I’m saying is that the decision to lose weight for yourself means that your far from a terrible person. It means you are investing in yourself and looking to improve some aspect of your life. 

Nobody thinks you are a terrible person. That kind of judgement only comes from yourself. In my experience the people who are actually terrible have a very high opinion of themselves and don’t give a fuck about other people.

Your version of terrible is your own judgement. But it’s note final. As humans were always growing and evolving throughout our lives and “who we are” is always fluid and changing. It’s not an absolute. My advice is to do a little exercise. Write down everything about yourself right now that you don’t like or that you think is terrible. Then write down a list of the traits you would like to have. The first list is the starting point, but it doesn’t matter at all. All that matters is the 2nd list and being open and willing to work toward building the qualities and traits in the 2nd list. Who you are can be the first list or it could be the 2nd list. Neither is the real version and neither is fake. It’s only who you are now and who you want to be. 

But at the end of the day the choice is yours. You can either accept who you are and curse everything about you and believe that you are less than. Or you believe that you are awesome and that you are a person who deserves great things and goes out to work for what you want and deserve. Which one is right is whichever one you choose to believe.  

So yes you are right in your current assessment of yourself. But that is only because you choose to believe that way. The opposite could be just as true. You just have to believe it’s possible. And work for it. I believe in you, and am here to help if you wanna talk. Best of luck my man."

rant,ff8wnn8,t1_ff8vzv3,1579698537.0,"Says who. What is true love anyways? That someone should love you just as you are no matter what? 

The truth is that if we don’t give a shit about ourselves or put effort into improving ourselves then why should anyone put the effort into loving you. 

You gotta love yourself before you can expect anyone else to. It has nothing to do with losing weight or being fat vs thin. Sure being thin might make you more attractive. But if your attitude is shit then nobody is gonna stick around to fall in love with you anyways."
iamatotalpieceofshit,ff8vkxq,t3_esbfp5,1579697564.0,Wow talk about a fucked up worldview. I don’t even know what to say to something like that other than what a complete and utter piece of shit.
rant,ff8vcq8,t3_esb7lg,1579697351.0,"The thing about losing weight is it’s not just the weight that makes people perceive you differently. It’s the confidence you will gain from it. Your mindset and attitude will definitely change and grow as you go through your weight loss journey and gain confidence and self-assuredness and belief in yourself and your abilities. The discipline required to change your physical attributes will transfer over through your mental self as well. 

But you gotta let it. If all you do is look at the negative and tell yourself you aren’t good enough then it won’t matter if your ripped and have a 6-pack, you will still have the same insecurities. You have to do it not for what people will think of you. But for what you will think of you. That’s what makes people attractive is the fact that they care about themselves and are always trying to improve some facet of their life. You gotta care about yourself first. And if you feel like losing weight is something that can help jumpstart that then by all means go after it. 

I have been training and coaching people for the better part of 10 years in the gym and it can truly change your life, not just physically but mentally as well as reaching goals in the gym and doing things you never done before transfers over to every other area of your life and makes you want to see what else you can achieve."

So way back in middle school, for some reason I had a huge fear of speaking up in class and asking for permission to go to the restroom. So come last period,  like 3 weeks into school, I had neglected to go to the restroom during lunch, probably because I was afraid or some shit. So naturally the urge to go comes along during class, and I’m sitting there trying to hold on for dear life until the bell rang which was futile to say the least. But for some reason I refused to ask the teacher to go. Suddenly my friend sitting next to me asks the teacher to go and I pipe up and ask her if can I go too. 

She tells me to wait until he returns. So I’m sitting there in agony counting the seconds until my friend comes back. At some point I couldn’t wait any longer and tried to let as little amount go as possible. Once my friend came back I booked it to the bathroom and let it rain. I thought I was able to hold it enough that nobody would notice considering I was wearing black pants. 

I come back to class and everybody stops and stares at me and the teacher asks me why my chair was wet. I look down and there was a sizable puddle pooled in the middle of my seat (seats were curved upward at the edges). 

Instead of owning up to it I yelled out to the class asking who poured water on my seat and just sat down on it like a piece of shit. Nobody said a word and I went home on the bus that day trying to play it as cool as possible. 

Looking back I could only imagine the aftermath that teacher had to deal with and honestly I don’t even give a second thought to what my classmates thought. To her credit she never brought it up throughout the rest of the semester and was one of the best teachers I ever had. As a result I kind of became the class clown the rest of my time in that class despite being super shy and  introverted at that time. I just drove that shit out of my mind and played it off like nothing ever happened."
AskReddit,few10l6,t3_eqqrdt,1579403943.0,"I mean it’s pretty popular professionally, but Golf is one of those sports that a lot of people think is easy before they try it. It’s often followed by them looking like they just came out of the womb flailing their limbs and shanking balls 15 yards sideways for an hour. That is until they make that one solid strike that sends the ball flying perfectly through the air 200 yards in front of them. Then they are hooked.

Just not a fan of when people put down advice like yours just because it’s hard or they haven’t been able to do it themselves. 

I guess if I could add onto your excellent post and share a nugget of wisdom I’ve learned in my 30 years it’s that our perception of how we see the world and react to the things that happen to us is everything. I consider myself to be a very positive and optimistic person even if things aren’t going my way. And I have some awesome friends and people Ive met along the way who are fantastic, caring and genuine people. And that’s not by accident. People who complain often and who have a general pessimistic view of the world and react negatively to pretty much anything are going always going to see the worst in things and will surround themselves with people who are the same way further entrenching these beliefs. If you are optimistic and positive then you will usually end up with positive and uplifting people around you and vice versa."
BeAmazed,fcr5bxf,t3_eihzg4,1577897000.0,"Pretty cool to watch but honestly not super impressive in the sense that while yes, he was jumping onto a (nearly) 6’ box, it’s a party trick nothing more. Look at his knees in each jump. Basically once the box gets to his lower chest he is not actually jumping any higher for each subsequent jump. He is basically just flexing his hip more and getting a bigger running start. 

This makes box jumps (in this fashion) pretty terrible for actually measuring or even improving  actual jumping ability. It’s more about how flexible your hips are. While insane box jump measures like this are still cool to watch. Even without taking into account the spring floor he’s probably only actually jumping about 25-30 inches which is not nearly as impressive. You could take someone who only jumps 2” off the ground and they would still be able to jump on a 25” box if they had even decent hip mobility.

So what if it’s hard. Keep pushing toward it. Keep putting it into practice every single day. And you could do all that and still get kicked in the teeth. But that doesn’t mean we gotta give up or stop trying.
