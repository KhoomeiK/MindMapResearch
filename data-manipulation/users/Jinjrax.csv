If someone says ""I'll probably vote for this candidate and here's why"" on their podcast we can quibble about it being an official endorsement but he's atleast promoting sanders as his preferred candidate atm, so semantics aside he's 'endorsing' bernie"

Destiny,fdo4aqk,t1_fdnyt4b,1578598637.0,"> On the first point, I’d say he’s not that consistent on that because he talks about wanting someone more left than him and wanting single payer but will often act as though he doesn’t. So I actually don’t know where he even stands on these now. My point was really that he spends a lot of time being positive about random candidates, is only ever negative about Bernie for the most part, and has very light criticism of Biden. 

He wants someone left of him so he should disregard all of his beliefs and negative opinions about bernie's policies because he's the left-ist leftist? That seems like something a *spineless coward who won't stand by his positions* would do  


> Second point, it doesn’t boil down to that, I’m saying it’s stupid to say you don’t care about it when you do in other areas. Why is morality unimportant in this particular case? If he never cared about it then I wouldn’t care about this other than the fact that it feels lazy. 

morality is unimportant because destiny is a sociopath PEPE nah destiny is being pragmatic here because the morality of assassinating a foreign leader because he's a threat to you is less important to him than the practical consequences of iranian retaliation/war that could overshadow US mistakes in Iraq tenfold. I guess he's just not interested in the morality because there's more interesting stuff on the table , and because discussing the ethics of killing Soleimani would take a realll long ass time. Have to talk about years and years of his career and influence that destiny won't know off the top of his head to decide if killing him was justified. Easier to talk about Iran than a specific person"
Destiny,fdnq800,t1_fdnj1q2,1578590773.0,"His position on bernie has been that he disagrees with basically all his major policy points for quite a while. Shitting on him and promoting other options seems pretty consistent?

On the soliemani, your paragraph boils down to ""If you don't care about the morality of x you can't talk about the practicality of x or anything remotely to do with x"". Bad take. Pretty sure destiny did talk about the morality of it in some capacity atleast regardless."

facepalm,fdhfym6,t1_fdh7850,1578421824.0,"That's not a realistic alternative. You can use it for shoes and gloves sure but full body hide wear is in no way viable past like the neolithic age. Animal skin doesn't hold heat anywhere to the degree wool does, it's inflexible, and it's much heavier. It's also much more time consuming to acquire and requires the slaughter of your livestock. Also can't be used by the majority of the population because of availability anyway; hide was used for tools, saddles, shoes, furniture, book bindings, the whole shebang. It's a good suggestion but it doesn't work in practice"
