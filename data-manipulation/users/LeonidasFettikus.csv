You mean the one that says MVVM? No, that is the MVVM pattern which is different from the MVC pattern. MVVM doesn't use controllers and is generally targeted towards desktop applications (MVP too, by the way).

&#x200B;

> Is the MVC part in the figure in my post exactly for a desktop MVC application? 

While it doesn't nearly explain all the intrinsic details of how MVC works, sure, you could use that diagram to explain how MVC is used in developing web apps."
dotnet,fd5gt4y,t1_fd5e7nu,1578177474.0,"That quote is about desktop development. There is a big difference between how desktop apps and web apps work. Desktop apps are stateful so you can instantiate a controller which will live for the entire duration of the session (or better said, for how long the app is running). This will enable you to use observer pattern.

Web apps in general and MVC specifically are designed to be stateless. So each new request causes all needed controllers, views, services, models, etc. to be instantiated anew. This won't make using observer pattern possible because everything, along with the observers, gets disposed when the request is finished.

I guess you could try to add a stateful layer around a web application. However, Microsoft tried to do that with WebForms and that died out because in the end, it caused more headaches than it solved."

csharp,fcmxjaz,t3_ei1xi9,1577796628.0,">how can I code that so B comes first?

You can't, this is how inheritance works. A will always be initialized before B because it's its parent class. Much like your father took a breath before you. If you need to control which WriteLine method is called first, then you have to change your inheritance strategy. For example:

    public class Program
    {
    	public static void Main()
    	{
                var b = new B();
    	    b.Initialize();
                var c = new C();
    	    c.Initialize();
    	    Console.WriteLine(""Hello World"");
    	}
    }
    
    public abstract class A {
        public A() { }
    
        public virtual void Initialize()
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""A"");
        }
    }
    
    public class B : A {
        public B() : base() { }
    
        public override void Initialize()
        {
            //This class' initialize called before base initialize
            Console.WriteLine(""B"");
            base.Initialize();
        }
    }
    
    public class C : A {
        public C() : base() { }
    
        public override void Initialize()
        {
            //Base initialize called before this class' initialize
            base.Initialize();
            Console.WriteLine(""C"");
        }

csharp,fcleg8v,t3_ehsx0g,1577745904.0,"It isn't being posted because you would need to render your SelectList inside the form in a way that the model binder will pick it up on post.

You got two options here:

In your view:

    @using (Html.BeginForm(...))
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < model.SelectedOtherFeaturesList.Count; i++)
        {
            @Html.HiddenFor(m => Model.SelectedOtherFeaturesList[i]);
        }
        //Other controls...
    }

Or use TempData to store your SelectList. TempData will be valid for one roundtrip. This approach would be cleaner.

Controller:

    public ActionResult GetSomeView()
    {
        TempData[""SelectList""] = new SelectList(...);
    }

View:

    Html.ListBoxFor(model => model.SelectedOtherFeaturesList, TempData[""SelectList""], new { size = ""5"" })
