Also not that useful, once on a platform the majority of people have decided where they're going, so it's just then a ""nice to know"", which isn't crucial information to add to a useful, minimalist design."

This is not a fact.  You're putting your personal spiritual beliefs onto other people as a 'fact', completely disregarding their beliefs.

The same way people don't like being preached by street preachers claiming they have the ""one real truth"", this is misleading and arrogant."

Cricket,femnc8o,t1_femlb6m,1579263552.0,"Currently it's ""the first time a player touches the ball, their last contact on the ground must be in the field of play"".

I'm suggesting it's ""every time a player touches the ball, their last contact on the ground must be in the field of play"".

Allowing people to jump up and down over the boundary 'juggling' the ball ""but it's all good they started in the field"" is kind of ridiculous to me.

NB: I should note that I also don't think it's fair for a player to jump out, parry the ball up back into the field, and then catch the ball, having last touched the ground from outside the field. IMO they should re-enter the field, touch the ground and then catch the ball."
Cricket,feml3z0,t1_femb2ym,1579260929.0,"The current rule isn't alright. 

It's an unfortunate attempt to try to add unnecessary 'drama' to the game.

Instead it just feels instinctively wrong.

It could easily be ""the player's last contact with the ground always needs to be inside the field of play, otherwise a boundary is awarded""

Fans new and old could easily understand that, and it fits with the spirit of the game."
