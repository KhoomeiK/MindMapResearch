HistoryMemes,ffhb1m8,t1_ffgsazb,1579928431.0,"Well it's also the United States of America hence why it makes sense to refer to Americans as Americans. There is no other country in the Americas that refers to themselves as the ""blank of America"" (at least I'm pretty sure about that) hence american = us."
Maher,ffgm6r3,t3_etazl9,1579909465.0,Yeah it bothers me too. I watch his show every week even though there are plenty of things on which we don't see eye to eye. His fixation is really stupid bc those in the armed forces don't fuck around when it comes to rules. I have faith in those people even if Trump were to try....my guess is he'll be plenty happy going back to living the life of a billionaire...business is good in that life.
Watches,fffrxur,t1_fffhxwo,1579890489.0,Depends on a couple things really. I've picked up some older rolexs that were mint and flipped them for a decent profit after getting some use out of them. If you're looking to make money on watches Rolex is definitely the way to go. Everyone knows Rolex so the consumer base is very large...and the price of new ones rises enough per year to buoy the used market. They average a 5% increase per year new so provided you get a used one about 10% below new watch cost...you're going to see a return. Yes it's not as good a return as an index fund...but you can't wear an index fund. You also have to make sure you are getting a serviced one and selling it before servicing is necessary. I basically only buy watches with returns from selling them so for me it's kind of its own subset of my portfolio. I definitely would stay clear of lesser names if it's actually something that you are looking to do.
insaneparents,ffe9xdt,t1_ffdrkl4,1579840776.0,I mean as an athiest I'm appalled obviously...but in their twisted minds they think the kids going to eternal paradise if they die so it makes some sense why they'd think that way. Anyways just another bunch of stupid fucks unintentionally ending their bloodlines....nature's a bitch.
MurderedByWords,ffe95ok,t1_ffdkr0a,1579840130.0,"Those are two different things. Teachers don't make minimum wage nor do firefighters...especially when you consider the vast majority of firefighters for major cities have pretty sick retirement benefits. My best friend in college father was a firefighter in Chicago. Lived in Chicago proper with a modest but nice house. Retired in his 50s having sent his son through college. It's really a matter of how you spend your money and save. Thomas sowell points out that we often romanticize the past as if life back then was better or that the basket of goods received by workers was bigger. It wasn't.  What defines a necessity has changed through the years. Back in the 60s in public housing almost nobody had a TV. Nowadays the average number of TVs in public housing is over 2. People are choosing to spend their money differently than they once did and that is fine, but you can't then only compare the one aspect of life that is worse...you have to take into account the entire picture. When one does that poor people in 2020 are far better off. Certain expenses have skyrocketed like healthcare...part of that is the result of the type of care you receive nowadays. In 1960 you just had a doctor who was pretty much there for everything. Now we have skin doctors, urologists, the list goes on. In this country there are a few things that people can do to guarantee they become middle class...1) graduate hs 2) work full-time 3) wait until 21 to get married and have kids...that's straight from the Brookings institute which is hardly a bastion of conservatism. If you work hard and constantly apply for new positions within or outside of your company...you will be fine."

worldnews,ff6w8xn,t1_ff6nehq,1579636176.0,But what were the two circumstances. I'm not saying that if say you were working at a grocery store without a union and then went into coal mining in a union that you wouldn't be better off for having been in the union in that comparison...the question is would the miners end of the day take home pay be higher in mining without a union...yes. I know that from experience of having dealt with mining unions...they are awful for the miners. The deal they accepted was worse than the deal initially offered to them.
worldnews,ff6ltye,t1_ff5arru,1579629950.0,"Unions used to be a force for good as they used to be run by the workers...so the incentive for the union was directly tied to doing what's best for that group. What we have seen throughout the years is that the power of unions gets concentrated at the top with executives who aren't really all that tied to the workers. In theory you'd think they would be replaced by the workers after terrible deals, but unfortunately that's not the case."
worldnews,ff5adcp,t3_erfcm7,1579585115.0,"The reality is that if you are a hard worker and constantly look for ways to increase and improve your skillset...you will garner a higher wage. Management at companies would prefer to higher within because it saves them money and reduces turnover. People feel like they deserve a higher wage just for having worked at a company for a long time...that's not the case. You deserve a higher wage when you prove yourself to be indispensable to the company. A ton of people do jobs that require virtually no training nor experience...so yeah they can be replaced extremely easily and also have very little leverage in terms of other employment opportunities. There's nothing wrong with say stocking shelves with a living, but if that's all you do you're probably not going to get paid a ton. Mike Rowe often talks about the thousands of opening across the united states for blue collar jobs that pay extremely well...you need to be willing to move and work hard...that's pretty much it."

sports,fewmu5y,t3_eqseo2,1579415057.0,"I think people don't realize that some people are just better fighters...can be at a very basic instinctual level among friends all the way up to UFC....some people just have that killer instinct and hit harder. McGregor is one of those guys. My guess is the accolades pouring in from this will sustain the necessary regimen for him to return to the top. I think after the Floyd fight, he couldn't get that will back up bc he literally made more money than any ufc fighter ever did in the ring...then nobody cared about him anymore...and bam he's back at it."
AskReddit,fewfro0,t1_feukg7n,1579409855.0,Honestly the greatest fucking critique of a movie I've ever seen.
Maher,feu9dtf,t1_fepnwmb,1579384406.0,"I think he wants someone who is practical. Some people want a true trailblazer who says things like free healthcare...but it's just not feasible (politically nor deficit wise). 99% of the stuff Bernie wants will not be done if he wins. That still can be fine if he's willing to take common sense deals. Buttigieg and Klobachar seem to be more in line with 60% of the country in terms of policy. If you're like me and have fantastic health insurance, it is a net loss for me to get government issued healthcare. Some people may say that's selfish but not many people are going to want to effectively take a pay cut for no reason."
facepalm,fel0s5e,t1_fekrfl9,1579211601.0,Well the other thing is that if you actually get an internship between Junior and senior year at a major corporation you can get around having a terrible major. There's very little risk for companies to hire interns as they are gone after 2.5 months...and they take risks on smart people in dumb fields. My good friend was an art history major and got a job at Goldman Sachs by interning there the summer before...smart people get good jobs.
facepalm,fekqlnf,t1_fek41ia,1579205571.0,Anything in engineering or business will get you a good paying job...the problem is more that kids go to school and don't think about why they are going to school. If you go to a university and get a degree in poetry say hello to making like 35-40k as a HS teacher. If you get a degree in finance...you can easily make 80k out of school. I'm not saying there isn't value in SOME people being poetry majors...but we don't need 100 out of every big university. I had two friends in school who chose awful majors...they make no money...the rest all make over 100k within a couple years of graduating.
HistoryMemes,fekfdhl,t1_fejhnoa,1579198882.0,The thing that often gets lost is the sterilization of what native american life was like before the English arrived. It's not as though they were not massacring each other...they were. Where did they get their land? They stole it was other tribes. That's the way it worked. We seem to think that before the United states life in America was some sort of hippy dream. Tribes would steal land from other tribes and commit genocides. The sentiment seems to be that it was ok bc it was native on native conquest. Conquest in the 18th and 19th centuries certainly seems barbaric by today's standards...but that is the way the world always worked. You captured land through violence.

letstradepedals,feeu5d9,t1_feepuef,1579041270.0,It was newly purchased in 2008 so idk if that is the model you are seeking.
facepalm,fe4dmz2,t1_fe4b010,1578858164.0,Well I cannot speak of statistics in every single country. I can only speak of the United States in which 23% of reported rapes lead to arrest(according to RAINN). Now when unpacking that data you have to also take into account that it's not exactly easy to find random rapists...ie if the rapist is unknown to victim/no DNA in system etc. It's not like the 77% go free because the cops don't want to prosecute the rapist. There are limited overall resources and detective capabilities. As a criminal justice system in the United States at least it's an unfortunate reality that you'd rather have a guilty man go free than an innocent man be guilty...that is why the bar in our criminal cases is that the jury must be sure beyond a reasonable doubt. That language is important because in civil matters it boils down to more likely than not...hence why someone who is sure in civil court can lose while going free in the criminal system.
facepalm,fe45tf6,t1_fe3z2a6,1578856098.0,The point being made isn't that rape isn't bad it's that lying about rape is bad for real rape victims. It makes people question actual rape victims. It reduces the overall credibility of those coming forward. Think about Duke lacrosse in like '07 or whatever...they tried relentlessly to paint those poor kids as rapists and then bam it was all a bunch of shit. One wasn't even there. The majority of rape claims are legitimate...it shouldn't be controversial to fuck the people who lie about it. Pretty much every person out there agrees that rape is bad. That's why it is illegal and people who are credibly accused are prosecuted. By supporting people who lie about rape you are effectively against true rape victims.

pics,fds9kpt,t1_fdrox8l,1578697497.0,"Does Israel do bad things? Yes...does every country pretty much? Yes. What one needs to do is look at things objectively and say ""okay well all other things being equal what is worse?"" Would the Palestinians be more benevolent to the Israelis than the Israelis currently are to the Palestinians? Absolutely not. Just take a look at the charter of Hamas...so it's not exactly a conspiracy theory to say Palestinians don't exactly instill a ton of confidence in the world over whom they select for leadership and how that leadership behaves."
pics,fdridev,t1_fdpd1dj,1578684971.0,So you don't respond at all to the reasonable points about Palestine shooting fucking rockets into Israel potentially blocking a path to peace. If Mexico were firing rockets into the United States...the US would wipe Mexico off the map. Israel has a much better record on human rights than any other country in the middle East by far.

Watches,fdmjtx9,t1_fdjgx7q,1578552547.0,"Bank tellers know fake bills immediately not by look but by FEEL. I can't say for certain that this would feel fake, but Im like 99.9999999% sure it would. Go to a local watch shop. Tell the guy you're just looking and not going to buy so if another customer comes in take care of them first. This will signal to him you're just looking and likely he will respect the honesty and be willing to indulge you. My guess is after doing that once or twice youll be pretty good at knowing what real feels like. I've had some people try to pass off fakes as real and bam the feel tells me immediately. Your eyes and brain can play tricks on you...but that instant touch will let you know immediately. Malcom gladwell talked about that same principle in the book ""Blink"" if you're looking to dive deeper into the idea of immediate reactions often being the truth."

HistoryMemes,fdg9i3y,t1_fdfxu0c,1578385833.0,"No the point is when you grant more and more power to a government there is a dearth of powerful challengers to it. I'm not saying that the Nazis were socialists in the way Bernie Sanders considers himself a socialist...but the underlying principle is that the government knows better than it's citizens how to do things. When the government controls something it is way less flexible and nimble in response to changing preferences than the private sector. If tomorrow some company dropped a smart phone that was so unbelievably better than the iPhone or Android phones available...people would flock to it. Apple would either respond to it by producing a better phone or it would eventually fold. Government programs do not work that way. If a nationalized healthcare sucks...it takes years and years to enact any meaningful change. All it takes to know that the government is dogshit at spending your(our) money is to take a look at all the needless spending. It's everywhere (and the fault of both Republicans and Democrats in the us). That kind of spending does not happen in private corporations because there is a much more meaningful relationship between executives and shareholders than there is between politicians and voters. At the end of the day we as a whole are usually better off when we as individuals can make more meaningful decisions for ourselves. If you need healthcare there are jobs that provide it. There are some good things the government does like cobra for those who are between jobs and need insurance what not, but the more power you give the government the less efficiently those things can evolve both in the present and long term. The whole ""which party is more Nazi"" thing is frankly such a childish thing that merely distracts from real problems that can be solved by simply putting reasonably intelligent people in office."

politics,fc6y743,t1_fc6jy5m,1577492551.0,Why though? Are we then going to ban tv ads too? Where is the line? In terms of targeting voters social media is a highly targetable platform. On TV if you buy a spot on law and order SVU the breakdown of who's seeing those ads is way less precise. That's what makes social media advertising great for political campaigns.
politics,fc2akjp,t1_fc29ogw,1577348782.0,"Well one of the good aspects of the ACA is cobra. When your employment ends or is terminated by the employer you get to continue coverage with your old plan for 18 months(not positive about the exact time but i know for certain its in that neighborhood). Basically then you can continue your coverage until you find work (you pay the rate but it's definitely better than anything you'd get elsewhere). Private insurance is a benefit for those of us who have great insurance. I was in a serious medical situation and was literally flown in a medjet across the country...for literally zero dollars. I'm not getting that treatment were we to have a completely socialized healthcare. So for me private insurance has been fantastic. It's something that tons of people in this country benefit from. If you don't have great insurance or have no insurance at all, I understand that it would be tough...but that doesn't change the fact that I would be losing something by private insurance ending...and so would millions of Americans. We have a long history of self reliance, and so I think (not including those who legitimately cannot work) people should go out and get jobs with benefits. If you can't find one you need to be willing to move and willing to look harder. If you say I'm lying literally go to mikeroweworks.org and see all the openings for decent jobs. There may not be a great job in your neighborhood, but you need to be willing to be like immigrants to this country and GO TO the work...not let it find you. That is the American ethos...be purposeful in your pursuits and you will be okay."
