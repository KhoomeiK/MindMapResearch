> It was not to be. When the war ended in triumph for Britain, India was denied its promised reward. Instead of self-government, the British imposed the repressive Rowlatt Act, which vested the Viceroy's government with extraordinary powers to quell ""sedition"" against the Empire by silencing and censoring the press, detaining political activists without trial, and arresting without a warrant any individuals suspected of treason against the Empire. 

> Public protests against this draconian legislation were quelled ruthlessly. The worst incident was the Jallianwallah Bagh massacre of April 1919, when **Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer ordered his troops to fire without warning on 15,000 unarmed and non-violent men, women and children demonstrating peacefully in an enclosed garden in Amritsar, killing as many as 1,499 and wounding up to 1,137.**

> The fact that **Dyer was hailed as a hero by the British, who raised a handsome purse to reward him for his deed**, marked the final rupture between British imperialism and its Indian subjects. Sir Rabindranath Tagore returned his knighthood to the British in protest against ""the helplessness of our position as British subjects in India"".

Recently, after the new span of the San Francisco Bay Bridge was opened (after a couple of years of delay, and a very rainy winter), a number of bolts holding the suspension cable to the concrete mooring snapped.

Initially, they thought it was corrosion due to the exposure of the bolts to the rain and standing water.  On further investigation, the culprit was determined to be hydrogen embrittlement.

However, this lava flow has now stopped;  Pu'u O'o's crater floor collapsed in May 2018, after a magma subsidence, and there has been no active lava flow on Hawaii since September of 2018.   (As we found out on a recent trip there..)

Edit: And no, there's no one living anywhere near that flow.  The lava flows have, over the last 60 or 70 years, devastated several hillside communities (Kalapana for one, and most recently, Leilani Estates).  Anyone living within 5 or 10 miles of that flow has been evacuated from that area.."
