GlobalOffensive,fde41z4,t1_fddvghj,1578330710.0,"They were talking about how much he was giving away though, not how much the others were receiving."
SkincareAddiction,fddx04m,t1_fdcwcg0,1578326034.0,Interesting. I bought this mask on a sale a few years ago because of the hype and it burned so bad that I only used it once. It felt horrible having it on your face.
depression,fcnym88,t3_ei30zb,1577820963.0,"I guess It's because the depression itself has become part of your existence and who you are and of course that's a scary thing to change. Change in general is scary, and changing who you are as a person is a HUGE change. You'll be someone new and you don't know who that is. It makes total sense to me. Reading this makes me realize I've also been feeling this way."
depression,fcnudbb,t1_fcnrlo0,1577818597.0,Suicide by cop is probably the safest and best bet if you wanna have someone else do it.
depression,fcnu2a2,t1_fcmoxtu,1577818417.0,"This is exactly what's stopping me too I feel like. Or at least I'm telling myself that. I don't want to traumatize anyone or cause bother to anyone. While I don't have anyone that could walk in on me like that, imagine killing yourself and someone finding your rotten half-liquefied corpse weeks later because of the smell? I haven't been able to come up with any good methods that doesn't potentially injure others or affect them in some other heavily negative way. This is why I really wish euthanasia was legal because you wouldn't be forced into these horrible and inhumane dilemmas."
depression,fcns369,t3_ei19sk,1577817356.0,I'm also spending it alone and my emotions are going haywire. 2019 has been the worst year of my life and this is ramping up to be the worst day of that year. I just wanna close my eyes and never wake up again.
CasualConversation,fcnr6tj,t3_ei4kj9,1577816893.0,"2019 has been the worst year of my life so it kills me that I don't have anyone to celebrate with tonight. My friends and family quickly distanced themselves from me when I became depressed a few years ago and I haven't been able to rebuild my life at all or find any new people to connect with. It may sound silly but I think there's powerful symbolism in how you ring in the new year which is why it's so important to do it surrounded by people you love while being as happy as you possibly can be - even if it takes alcohol or some other substance to reach that state. I feel like it sets the tone for the year to come in some way, and I simply won't be able to survive another year like 2019. I feel anxious to say the least."
