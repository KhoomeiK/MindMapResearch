He'd make me tea with it, too, if I was visiting. I was heartbroken. It was silly how heartbroken I was. I actually got mad and told him I would have taken it.

He's such an absent parent that his own daughter, who loves him, doesn't want her brothers to be raised by him. 

Compare Don with Henry, who is another career man with a stressful job, but who comes home every night and connects with the kids, and just as importantly connects with Betty. He tells her when he thinks she's wrong but he supports her as well. He's an active member of the family.

Ken is fascinating to me in that he was given the gift of good intuition, but he squanders it by not following through. At the end of the day he's trapped by his pride and by society's definition of success. By season 7 he's so consumed by his unhappiness, which he blames on everyone else but himself, that he foregoes severance (free money!) and takes a job at Dow *just to torment Pete.* Then he refuses to move his business to SC&P-West... again, purely out of spite. 

It's almost like he's turned into that robot from his short story, the robot who is a slave to his job and the only choice he has is to act destructively, so that's what he does. Except Ken *isn't* a robot - he has every opportunity to choose a different life, but he doesn't!

After that point, Peggy's relationship with Don is permanently, radically different.

I think the title ""New Girl"" can be interpreted as a reference to the fact that Peggy isn't the new girl anymore, and that her goals and behavior going forward are going to reflect that.

Having him lose an eye in Detroit was darkly funny and such a fitting punishment for his consistent refusal to break free of a job he loathed. 

In the end, Kenny never managed to realize a life that would make him *happy*. His job with Dow seemed to be more an act of convenience and spite than genuine passion. Part of it was a sin of pride, too - he didn't want to live off his wife's fortune. (Though wasn't the Dow offer influenced by nepotism?)

Pete, on the other hand, finally seemed to own a life-defining moment with Learjet and that final, hail-Mary play for Trudy.

- add 3 cloves minced garlic and 1 tsp of cumin seeds, cook till fragrant, say 1 minute 
- add in 1 cup of rinsed basmati rice, stir frequently and cook until the rice is toasted/ edges are translucent, say 5 minutes 
- add 1.5c water, 1tsp kosher salt and 1tsp turmeric, turn the heat up to bring to a simmer then turn the heat down to low
- cover & cook until the rice is done, about 20 mins
- when done, stir in a handful of dried cranberries and some chopped fresh cilantro

tonightsdinner,feff833,t1_fefdxpb,1579055060.0,"It's plain yogurt thinned out with lime juice and some water, with mint and cilantro stirred in. A pinch of salt. Let it sit for an hour or so before using, let the herbs infuse into the yogurt. Really tasty!"
matrix,fee9hro,t1_fearqoj,1579029168.0,"They should send Carrie-Anne to his front door with her sunglasses and a pair of berettas. ""Time's up. What's it gonna be, Merv?"""
xxfitness,fedy6in,t3_eonvso,1579022379.0,"I think unsolicited advice is rude. I see people doing things ""wrong"" all the time at the gym but I don't say anything because it's none of my damn business. 

I tend to build relationships with other regulars, though, and we chat about our workouts and what we're working on, etc. Sometimes stuff comes up like, ""oh I noticed you doing XYZ the other day, do you think you could show me that?"" or, ""I've been frustrated with WXY exercise lately, I notice you're good at it, can you give some feedback?"" 

In this context, I've given advice and received feedback from other gym goers. Never have I walked up to a stranger and given them coaching. And nobody's ever done that to me. If they did, I'd probably take in in stride, though. Most of the time, it comes from a good place (I choose to believe). Hell, it might even help. 

Try not to overthink this incident, op. Imho what he did was rude, but he probably just thought he was helping. If he bugs you again, I'd make my boundaries clear, like, ""I realize you are trying to help but I'd rather you left me alone."""
kettlebell,fecc6er,t3_eodhw3,1578970533.0,"My exact words while watching, ""wow, this dude is no joke."" 

You're no joke, op. Nice work!"
xxfitness,feaggp1,t3_eo9isx,1578948454.0,"1. Deodorant is mandatory.  

2. Perfume & cologne is banned. Especially axe body spray. 

3. On Wednesdays, we wear pink.

4. There would be group workouts every Saturday morning followed by a brunch potluck/ community chat, where we all become bffs and support one another. Group workouts rotate between yoga, kettlebells, kickboxing, dance, lifting, etc. Sometimes we do hikes or bike trips or whatever else. If a member has a special talent they can lead the group in their area of expertise.   

5. People who hit milestone PRs get to ring a big bell and wear a tiara and/or heman belt, and everybody congratulates them for being awesome. 

(The last two are optional but why would anybody opt out?)"
xxfitness,fe90er4,t3_eo69dq,1578932870.0,"I played this for the first time a few weeks ago, over at a friend's house. I'm a fit person, but I definitely worked up a sweat after a few songs (and I got a bit motion sick, lol)!

I'd say it depends on what your goals are. If you want to improve conditioning through moderate aerobic workouts, then Beat Saber definitely qualifies. If you want to build muscle/ strength, you're going to need to integrate resistance work as well."
xxfitness,fe8xrc6,t3_eo5qa7,1578932138.0,"My glutes and legs seem to take forever to develop, my upper body grows like mad. Or maybe it's just because I hold all my bodyfat in the lower half, so it just *looks* that way. Like, maybe I just can't see the muscles in my legs because I have more fat there. 

Either way, I wish it were the other way around. I'll admit however, it feels really good when other women tell me I have awesome shoulders :)

I don't know what my favorite muscle group to work out is, maybe it actually *is* shoulders lol. I like overhead work, overhead presses, overhead carrys, turkish getups, snatches... something about holding a heavy thing over my head makes me feel like a superhero :p"

... wait."
GilmoreGirls,fe8rv84,t3_enz3jk,1578929956.0,"He'd hate them because 

1. he hates all change, good and bad
2. the new star wars films are legitimately, objectively disappointing
3. at the end of the day he's not really a fantasy/ space opera fan, but a scifi/ psychological thriller fan. star trek, outer limits, twilight zone, dr who... probably was into bsg as well.

in my necessarily biased opinion, of all the GG characters, Luke had the best taste in entertainment and it always, *always* pissed me off when the girls gave him a rough time about it.

he'd be so into the expanse & black mirror these days, he'd tune in and then go on&on about the direction of modern civilization and how if we're not careful, technology will rob us of our shared humanity. something something DARNIT, LORELAI, NO CELLPHONES IN THE DINER!"
xxfitness,fe8qpb1,t3_eo31y6,1578929448.0,"I second the expression of surprise that anybody is noticing other people's panty-lines at the gym. But, if it bugs you (it would bug me, too, because I'm neurotic) I like aerie seamless thongs."
GilmoreGirls,fe8phui,t1_fe7xnc5,1578928883.0,"Me too and I hated them. I used to say they didn't offer any warmth and they just got in the way. Regardless, I had a half dozen of them and wore them all the time because that's just what everybody wore. Corduroy boot cut pants + stripey top + fitted jean jacket + skinny scarf = early 2000s college freshman uniform.

I still have the jean jacket, everything else I wonder what we were thinking."

neoliberal,fdrf942,t1_fdrc2he,1578683670.0,"I actually like Marianne Williamson. Obviously I'd never vote for her in a presidential race, and her new-age vocabulary tends to turn people off, but the essence of what she's saying isn't *wrong*, imho. She's very authentic, and fearless in putting herself out into the mire and calling on people to step up and act out of a place of courage and love, rather than fear and cynicism. If shopping for a self-help guru, I think people could do alot worse than MW. 

Plus the memes were hilarious. I'm sad she's out so soon."
fatlogic,fdqttrt,t1_fdqtlen,1578674738.0,"I feel this deeply. I'm miserable at work alot of the time. It affects everything else in my life, no matter how I try to keep it in a box. 

thoughts & prayers, ostentia <3"
