This is what happens currently. If you live in Montana no one gives a shit who you vote for. Ohio and Florida thousands of miles away dictate the outcome. You can't really hide that some areas are politically diverse than others. Unlike you I can acknowledge this reality and at least provide for your your vote as an individual mattering and not being disregarded like all those rural people in California, New York and Illinois.

> It's also why we have states rights and to a lesser extent municipal rights. 

I care about people's rights more than the rights of any one governing entity. For an election on a national level, every individual should be treated the same and not divided based on which state of whatever they live in.

> Without it The executive branch would become even more powerful and the other 2 branches would simply wither.

The power of the political position is not going to change because of the system that changes it. I am not suggesting that any one political office should have different powers delegated to it, just that the means to select that person reflects more what the people want.

> Equality would shift. You're not seeing how much of an issue that is bc all the power would be determined in the most populated areas. Votes from rural voters simply wouldn't matter. Equality is different here.

No. Equality will be real. Rural votes don't currently matter under the existing system. Many rural states are ignored by politicians and many rural areas are ignored as I have mentioned above. If populated areas are such hot property, then people campaigning will eventually have an equal share and only the rural votes will be able to break that deadlock. Otherwise I don't understand why rural people are so important: there are so many other 'underrepresented' demographics. Should we have an electoral college for people based on skin colour, income, and whether they get up before or after 6am?

> Population isn't the only determining factor here. There's a lot more to it.

A country is nothing without its people. It should be the only factor.

> You've really got to see why this system exists.

It's a shit system. It does not achieve any outcome that people say it does. It doesn't provide for rural voters, and it doesn't provide for smaller populated states.

> There is a very good reason for it.

The 'good' reasons you have provided are to appeal to rural voters and small states. However the reality is that politicians don't actually campaign in all the lesser popular areas. Of the around 20 states with 10 or less EC votes, only three are considered 'battleground states'. The two main ones are amongst the most populous states. As well as this, rural voters within states don't matter under the system. So many states have the rural block entirely disregarded due to urban areas having more away and the EC not requiring a proportional distribution.

In summary, the 'good reasons' that you are talking about contradict the reality in that rural voters aren't really provided for. The whole 'people from miles away' also happens currently. Everything you say that the EC was designed to prevent happens under it. Until you can demonstrate an understanding of this reality, I refuse to talk any further, because I care about what does happen, and not relying whatever was 'intended'. You talk about why the reality of socialism is different to the intentions (even though I never brought up socialism), so hold the EC to the same standard otherwise I am done here."

It sounds like self-determination wasn't there to begin with. I don't want '50/50' or any other forced outcome bullshit. I only want every individual to have the same voting power on a national level as every other individual. The electoral college does not provide for nor support that."

What happens in selection process for private parties is irrelevant. It's not a statutory a requirement for the government election process, so there is no guarantee that it does happen. It's something that cannot be relied on for government elections.

Because campaign strategies would change to accommodate the fact that they can no longer rely on not respecting that the people actually want.

The system that does not give everyone equal voting power is used to give people fair voting power? This makes no sense.

All I said is that a system should provide seats in accordance to the portion of votes it received. I really don't understand how that's tyrannical unless you consider that equal representation is tyrannical.

> And America is very large. It isn't that much smaller than Canada and is the third largest country in the world. 

If it's too large that it cannot function under a fair and equal representation, then it's too large to be a country and really shouldn't exist as one.

> The reason you want balance is bc competition is good. A politician needs to know that they can be voted out of office so the parties have less control over their vote and the citizens have the power. 

Which is what happens when you provide individuals with equal voting power. You provide some individuals more than others and politicians only care about those with the most. This is literally what happens under the current system where Florida and Ohio only matter, which are among the most populous states.

> You clearly don't like the results of the last election but you've got a very anecdotal and opinionated view of the electoral college.  

I didn't even vote democrat for the last election.

Clearly, you got the result that you want from the last election and you are defending this garbage system that apparently provides for rural voters yet most rural states got no campaign presence in the election and rural areas of places such as California, New York, and Illinois got no representation because it was winner-take-all from the urban votes.
