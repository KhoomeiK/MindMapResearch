KobeBryant24,ffqqc49,t1_ffqgmty,1580141174.0,"You’re right for some forms of flight, but wrong for others.

There’s a big difference in mortality based on pilot training for example - ATP (airline pilots are at this level) vs PPL is a HUGE gulf in training. Kobe’s pilot was reportedly ATP, so less likely to be unsafe.

Perhaps the most important factors here are the fact that this was a helicopter, and that it was flying in low visibility. Most deadly accidents in small aircraft come from low visibility situations rather than mechanical failures.

Additionally, the helicopter was flying under “special VFR”, which is low-visibility rules but still operating by visual reference. These margins are what make this unsafe.

Flying with an ATP in a commercial situation is far and away drastically safer than riding in a car. This is certainly true for commercial airliners, and generally speaking an ATP flying a smaller aircraft is still about as safe as a car.

(Overall, small airplanes are approximately as safe as riding a motorcycle.)

flying,ffoets5,t1_ffnw3ly,1580076921.0,"Total speculation warning, let's wait for the report, but:

I can imagine this behavior being inadvertent IMC (immediate climb is not a bad idea) assuming they were hearing the ""you're too low for FF"", then a left turn when trying to get back into range, seeing terrain ahead, reasoning ""I should get below this cloud cover"", then CFIT.

Again entirely speculation and honestly I hesitate to post such stuff, but here we are."

AskMen,ffnqos0,t3_eu2ixr,1580069463.0,"Run from fights. Fights are a stupid old tradition that we’re at one point necessary (what are you going to do, avoid your neighboring caveman forever?), but now are not necessary (just leave this person behind).

Run every chance you get. You get no positive benefits from a fight unless it lets you escape, and that’s incredibly rare.

If your pride is fragile enough that you need to win a fight to build it up, seek therapy instead of violence."

I remember we did “lockdown” in the school. Couldn’t leave classrooms. All the classes had TV’s on the news.

There was a short period where we had to get down on the floor. We lived close to an army post, so I think it was precautionary.

Perhaps the strangest thing is the odd memory of being glad we weren’t having to do normal classroom activities, and the extreme attention sorta encoded itself as entertainment in my brain. It wasn’t until significantly later that I realized how horrifying it all was.

Next thing I remember from that period was the impending sense of inevitable retaliation."
