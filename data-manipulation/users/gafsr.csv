confessions,fghgk2i,t3_ey7gxx,1580784329.0,"I am gonna give you a pro tip to life and gonna tell a bit about me:my knowledge about most things necessary to society life is very small and because of that I always tried everything I could,that is because if I get the chance to try something new even if it doesn't look the nicest at first is gonna be fine and good for me because I can learn trying and that is really important,what you learn from being told and what you learn from actually doing it is really different,so you should try something new with your friend if you never did try anything with a man before,that may sound like a bad thing for some people,but why not?you can like something and you don't even know it,but trying can change it and if he really is your friend and truly likes being with you even if you two can't stay together for whatever reasons it will be fine"
AskMen,fghf7g5,t3_ey5jmd,1580783485.0,"First:I don't call them friends,I call them the assholes that are gonna have the head on my wall if they don't go away,second:if you want to get rid of them simply say something like what I just did,most of them are scared of anyone who talks like that,so it works every time and I have to do little to nothing to get rid of the annoyance,third:you should notice sooner these things,it's no big deal to have the talk with a friend about how they are and what they are doing,if they really care they will try something new and hope it works,if you talk and literally nothing changes,then get rid of them,if they don't even want to talk then ask yourself:why did I think this person was my friend?because you can't call a friend someone who ignores your needs like that"
depression,fghegc8,t3_ey6pg8,1580783017.0,"I usually feel bad when I see them because even if it's good to see something nice once in a while pity is worse than nothing because at least you think you can get something good if you try really hard,but if it comes from the pity people have it just feels like you can't get the real thing"

TooAfraidToAsk,fg8crez,t3_ex5wet,1580615710.0,"It's really hard to find out where you are from by just talking to you,so assuming you are from a place where the majority speaks the language you are using is the only way unless you say otherwise,it's not like everyone on the internet will ask ""where you are from?""every time they talk to someone,so it's either give people the hard way to get the thing they asked,but in USA would be easier or give people the easier way that doesn't work outside of the USA and the easy way tends to be common sense,so someone using it is way more likely,I am a Brazilian,but I know if I don't say anything about where I am from it's likely that people will think I am from the USA because I am writing in English"
