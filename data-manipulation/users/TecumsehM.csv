No matter how we divide it, the earth will spin around it’s axis as it does and the days will start and end in the ways they do and the seasons will move as they do.

Time is an axis, used to display movement over trajectories. A second hand moving around a clock is a measurement of a trajectory that we have applied meaning to. To a comet our notches mean nothing."
