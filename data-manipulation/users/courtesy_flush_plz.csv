AskReddit,ffpx64x,t3_eukfgk,1580109280.0,"When I was in high school, I made up this game where I'd get a newspaper & would allow half a dozen or so other teammates on the wrestling team to choose one age of death for the day's obituaries.. if your age was closest to that of the person who died, you got a point. Most points at the end of the obituaries won.

I would put together little prize packs with food, snacks, other small valuables & eventually would take donations from other teammates to secure their spot in future games.

We played on the bus on the way to meets & tournaments. I first started getting the newspapers to keep track of results of other wrestling competitions in the region for other high schools & colleges,, don't ask me how that ""evolved"" into what we started calling 
""Old Ones On Ice""

Guys started tryna cheat my game & get the paper that morning & run the numbers, so I started going online & just digging up (pardon the pun) a past random day.

It kinda sucked when there was a child obituary, but the game must go on."
