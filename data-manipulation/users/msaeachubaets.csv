Doing something fun with the pup can help to, just to see them being happy. Any kind of new stimuli - doesn't have to be away from home or even something that costs money - it's just so charming to see them be all curious.

I honestly just let him - might as well make it a good thing.

dogs,fej55yf,t3_epfhmp,1579157320.0,"What kind of supplies are you looking for? For general collars and leashes, leather is ideal as it doesn't shed microplastics, and if it's grass fed then the environmental impact is minimal. I've heard good things about hemp also, West Paw makes some good ones and uses lots of recycled materials also. For waste bags, the ""biodegradable"" plastics are arguably worse than ordinary plastic bags as they degrade into microplastics outside of very specific conditions. I recommend wax paper bags used for baked goods - I've tried corn starch based bags and they were just too flimsy.

dogs,fefo9xz,t3_eomrod,1579060718.0,"At my old job, there was an old man who was very odd that came in regularly. He would talk to us for literally hours about anything and everything. (I tuned most of it out cause I was trying to do my job, but I remember him once talking at length about nuclear power in Japan... dude, I just work here. There were times when our manager would call the phone or request us in back just to get him off our ass so we could do our jobs. He also had a nasty infection on his face he refused to see a doctor for...) He'd talk at length about his puppy, which was pleasant enough. He was good friends with a regular who takes care of and trains her dogs very well, so I figured any red flags would be smoothed out by her. After a while he came in with a broken ankle from the dog - who he said he didn't want to take to classes because he didn't need a show dog(???). She was growing bigger and pretty much entirely untrained.   
   
After a while he just... stopped showing up. We learned from the aforementioned regular that apparently now that he can't control the puppy he left her in a crate pretty much all day. What makes me even more mad about that is in one of his looooong conversations, he mentioned the breeder would take the dog back for any reason. Last I heard before I quit was that the regular's son was dogsitting for him a lot and trying to talk him into giving him the puppy. Poor dog. I really hope they ended up in a proper home."

The reason my vet didn't extract was because they were her major chewing molars and the tooth wasn't too bad - my vet doesn't like to extract the major molars unless she has to, especially with dogs like mine with small delicate jaws and relatively huge teeth. The root canal was also not because of decay, it was because of injury. Because of the treatment i have to keep extra good care of her teeth - brushing (almost, I forget sometimes) every day. A root canal can leave the tooth open to infection if extra care isn't taken. This also means I have to get her teeth professionally cleaned almost every year.

dogs,fdcx5kx,t3_ekk4ky,1578286914.0,"Hey, I'm in a similar boat. One of my dogs resource guards, and if she starts my other, larger dog will finish it. It's stressful sometimes, but with proper management your dogs can live happily together. /r/reactivedogs has a lot of resources that are very helpful. Here's my personal anecdotes.   
   
First, don't beat yourself up. You'll make mistakes. You're not perfect. Dog fights can sound a lot worse than they really are. It's still worth getting them checked out just in case, but in the moment it sounds like they're killing each other! It's horribly stressful but usually not as bad as it sounds. Also - do better than me and DON'T break up a fight by putting your arms between them! I've gotten a nasty bite this way - not the dog's fault, he didn't even realize I was there. My dogs are small enough that I can pick one up when something happens, but with larger dogs you can grab by the collar - or do what's called a wheelbarrow, where you pick them up by the back paws. 
   
High value food is a lot easier to manage than something like beds or toys. That's what my girl guards too. There's probably one dog who's the aggressor here, and the other who's reacting to it - figuring out who's who can be very helpful in management.   
   
In my house, my dogs aren't left alone together, just out of an abundance of caution. My older girl, who guards, typically has run of the house while my younger boy stays in a gated off room. This is pretty unusual I think, but it's because she was here first and my boy is used to being sectioned off from when he was a destructive puppy.   
   
Mealtime is always in crates which are in separate rooms with no line of sight. They're both crated before the food even comes out. When they're done, the bowls are put out of sight. If you're just starting to take bowls away, trade the empty bowl for a treat - that'll keep your dogs from guarding their bowls from you. Typically, I let the guarder out first and take her outside right away. I think the distraction of outside smells helps clear her mind of any anxiety she had over the other dog stealing her food. Either while she's outside or after she comes in, I let my other dog out. You might want to wait longer than this - you're still learning your dogs individual needs.   
   
No dogs in the kitchen! This is where most fights happen. Especially if this is where the dog food comes from, too. When I'm making something the dogs will want (like, something starchy or cheesy or meaty, as supposed to like, slicing an apple) I crate one or both of them. I do this during mealtime too. They've never had a fight over people food, but I want to keep it that way.   
    
High value stuff, like chews and the really good treats, I keep in their own separate drawer that I don't even open unless the dogs are separated somehow. They know where the good stuff comes from! 
   
You might not need to do as much as I do - this is just personal experience. Just a few days ago I messed up and caused a fight, and I feel awful about it, but nobody's perfect and the dogs will recover. You'll learn your own management routine by watching your pups. You'll figure out how they communicate their discomfort and be able to intervene and learn what makes them tick. With my girl, first thing she does is lower her head - it sounds vague, but I can identify the specific way she does it immediately and swoop in. You'll get there too with time.   
   
TL;DR: You're not alone. Don't beat yourself up, you didn't see it coming. It seems really daunting now but with a bit of time, managing it and identifying your dog's signals will become second nature. Everybody makes mistakes with their dogs sometimes. All we can do is keep trying to do better. There are plenty of us who have gone through the same thing and we can all support each other."
dogs,fdcu48c,t3_ekhsqo,1578284365.0,"It will never be easy. No matter how many dogs you have, it will always be devastating.   
   
It is worth it for the time spent together. All good things must come to an end. There's so much they can teach us during their short time on Earth. Each individual dog has something unique to offer us, whether we know them for a year or a decade. The pain will never truly be gone, but with time we learn how to cope and continue on with our lives. Without hurt and loss, we couldn't appreciate happiness and love. 
   
When a dog's time comes, it's never easy. But in the end, you will feel better knowing they will no longer feel pain or sadness.   
   
When I was in a bad point in my life, all I could think about was how awful it was going to be when my dog died. I don't mean to pry, but if you're currently going through hard times, you'll worry about it more. When I got my depression / anxiety under control I thought about it a lot less. And if you end up getting your own dog, you'll spend a lot more time enjoying them while they're here than worrying about when they're gone.   
   
I know someone who keeps rats, which are notoriously short-lived. Every time they lose them they say never again, they don't want to experience the pain. But then they experience their love again and remember it's worth it."

dogs,fdc70zx,t3_ekd1uc,1578268351.0,"Hokay, where do I begin? Back when I had a job I would buy pretty much every new harness/collar/leash I could find.  
   
**Ruffwear Front Range:** Great for one dog, awful for the other. It's very stiff, so on smaller dogs it can restrict movement. My senior had super weird proportions and none of the sizes worked for her. My younger dog, though - it is PERFECT. Fits him just right, doesn't restrict his movement at all, doesn't slide around, and he can't back out of it. Solidly built, I just wish the front clip was metal like the back one.   
   
**Paco Collars:** Once again, perfect for my younger, didn't work for my senior. I adore the V-neck I got for my boy, I asked for a little D-ring to attach a light and tags and it turned out perfect. It's not a walking collar, just an ID necklace that is big enough to back out of if it got caught. Pricey, but the craftsmanship is lovely and the leather is wonderfully soft. He's got real thick fur and it hasn't rubbed it off at all. Unfortunately, I had a similar problem for my little senior - I ordered a regular collar instead of a V-neck and the size just didn't work out. I should've asked if they could do a custom size like the V-neck, but alas hindsight is 20/20.  
   
**Julius K-9:** Despite all the good press this brand gets, I really wasn't happy with it. Both my dogs were between sizes so neither fit very well. I ordered a pair of saddlebags along with the harnesses that I was charged for but over a year later still haven't received. I don't like how it distributes pressure without the optional chest pad which costs extra. Both my dogs can back out of them, and the front strap is easy for a dog to grab and chew up. They don't offer any repair or replacement services either. I also don't like the general aesthetic the company has...   
   
**Lupine Collars:** ADORABLE designs. I have the cutest little martingale with owls on it for walking my boy. I really like it, but I wish it had a buckle. I really like their guarantee, even if the dog chews it up they'll replace it. I've seen dogs wearing lupines that were 10+ years old. They're not very soft, but they'll go to hell and back.

Lepto is not only very dangerous to dogs, it can also infect people. I'm so glad your pup is okay and hopefully people heed thus advice!   
   
The only ""optional"" vaccine I don't get is Lyme, only because Nexguard has been proven to be as effective at preventing Lyme as the vaccine is. If I went off Nexguard, I'd get it in a heartbeat.

However it's important not to stay on this diet very long as it's not nutritionally complete. If you want to stay on a homemade diet, it's important to consult with a vet nutritionist to ensure it's got all the nutrients your dog needs.

Our primary vet has been wonderful, she is experienced in physical therapy for dogs, we see her 2x a year and she gives her legs a very thorough inspection in case we have to take any action. She walks with a pretty noticeable hobble and doesn't use the worse leg of the two while moving any faster than a walk, but she otherwise can do everything my other dogs do.   
   
I have to make sure not to push her too far though. If I take her on a long walk two days in a row, she'll be very sore when we get home - she pushes herself too far and won't show pain until we get home. So I have to monitor her activity and make sure she doesn't run or jump too much. It sounds like a lot more work than it actually is - she usually sleeps most of the day. When the weather is cold she sometimes needs extra help to manage the pain. I got her a heated bed and she really loves it.   
   
Wishing you and your pup the best! It's always so awful to see our pets in pain, but most dogs with LP can live full, active, normal lives."

Your best bet at this point might be a crate. Gunner Kennels are I believe the best rated ones for crashes."

I wonder if it's his teeth that's bothering him. You made the right choice in supplementing though - while adult dogs can live through a brief hunger strike until they get over it and eat their food, it's really important for a puppy to get all their calories, especially if they lost weight."
dogs,fcgh6ll,t3_eh84in,1577639983.0,"Unfortunately, it's not uncommon for dogs to develop resource guarding after being fixed. It's a known issue and we're not exactly sure why it's happened, but there are a handful of papers written about how relatively common it is.   
   
/r/reactivedogs has a lot of good resources, however dog-on-dog resource guarding is very complicated and usually can't be completely eliminated, only managed. Don't meet other dogs in areas with toys."
