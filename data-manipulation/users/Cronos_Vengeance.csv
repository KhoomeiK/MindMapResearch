No. I just wouldn't play the game. You're still looking at it from a PVP perspective. And if players like me don't play the game, then the toggle becomes a lot less useful. I have no intention of playing a game where I fall far behind as a default. PVP players will have no issue because they only enter the mode when they want a break. PVE players will only feel forced to play PVP. Which, is what I think the design is truly about. Making me your content fodder. Who wants to be fodder? 

But it does not matter. Someone else told me that the game is nearly full loot, which changes things to an extent. Makes the toggle forced to have greater rewards for the PVP players, and makes the PVE toggle even less interesting to me. I am out. I hope you enjoy the game."

That answer does not even attempt to answer the question asked. Straw man. You answered, ""Why is the game built the way it is?""

>A large, large portion of the alpha fan base wanted a hardcore pvp game.

No trouble with that. PVP players deserve to have games they enjoy as well. 

>You have to understand that some people just don’t want want you’re describing.

Great I agee. No problem. You have to understand that same principle from the opposite side. Also, my question was not referring to making the game a certain way. I was simply trying to get the idea, that if you make a PVE toggle in a PVP based game, and you make the rewards largely greater in one mode over the other...you make the toggle pointless. Risk versus reward means little in games. The reward is all that really matters. I don't want to write the same thing a third time, so let me, kindly, quote myself:

>In a PVP game with (near) full loot, why is there a toggle? I would argue that it is to entice PVE players to play the game increasing body count as well as revenue. Okay, fair enough. They want to have a stronger audience since full loot games...well tend to not fare that well in the MMORPG market for very long from what I have seen. Well, at least the ones who get serious about world-building.

>Anyway, They want PVE players to come in and help fund the game. So they put in a toggle. So yeah, that is why I am here...the toggle brought interest from me who previously had no interest in the game. ~~But then I see your post~~. Giving a blanket boost to PVP toggle. So then, ~~can't believe I have to answer my own question for you~~, I think...what PVEer would want to play in a mode where you are gimped? I wouldn't. It feels like I am wasting my time. So then, I feel pressured to either play the PVP mode or quit the game. That is the point I am making. The bonus makes the toggle irrelevant. It becomes a masquerade, intending to entice PVEers into a game they normally wouldn't play. Then make the rewards so much better for PVP that they feel pressure to play that mode making those players content for their intended audience. It is the same reason people hate free to play pay to win games. You become content for the whales.

Okay next:

>Most aren’t super jazzed about any sort of toggle in any way.

We are on nearly the same fucking page, my dude. It feels like I am being tricked into becoming your fodder. Why would I be happy about that? And why would you be happy about it? Rhetorical questions."
MMORPG,fdn4uw9,t1_fdmsbqs,1578577333.0,">if you get the number right the average pvp on player won't win more than pve because of ganking.

Right. And I would have no trouble with making PVP kills award exp and even loot drops if the game supports loot drops. But a blanket EXP and bonus mats makes the other toggle irrelevant does it not?

>I just explained this yet you're anwser was irrelevant?

The numbers used are irrelevant to the question I asked originally. Which remains unanswered.

> It's called balancing risk and reward. Same way a harder mobs give better rewards.

Enlighten me, which games give a blanket EXP boost to all modes and extra mats from all things just because you killed a harder enemy earlier in the game? I was not aware of it. Harder enemies give more EXP and have better loot. No doubt. I have no issue with this. But that was not the bonus you talked about in the comment I first responded to. 

>At the end of the day you get the same rewards in both but turning on pvp doesn't become over penalize yoj, forcing you into pve.

I have no issue with a reward system in which you got credit for your PVP kills or even loot from those kills. You earned it. But when you blanket give more to all modes...it makes playing the PVE toggle less rewarding and gimped. Which makes you feel as though you are wasting your time playing that toggle. Which makes you feel forced to play PVP.  The opposite of your argument. You don't want to be forced into PVE, and I don't want to be forced into PVP. 

>You seem not to be able to grasp the increase risk of pvp and even with boost they would still loose way more. This is almost full inventory loot game.

Full loot. I honestly did not know that. That does change things. However, the point I was trying to make with my original question is not changed. Since you have been strawmanning me by answering the question you asked yourself: ""Why does the PVP mode deserve more?"" it would seem as though you have no intention to try and figure that out. Let me clarify.

In a PVP game with (near) full loot, why is there a toggle? I would argue that it is to entice PVE players to play the game increasing body count as well as revenue. Okay, fair enough. They want to have a stronger audience since full loot games...well tend to not fare that well in the MMORPG market for very long from what I have seen. Well, at least the ones who get serious about world-building. 

Anyway, They want PVE players to come in and help fund the game. So they put in a toggle. So yeah, that is why I am here...the toggle brought interest from me who previously had no interest in the game. But then I see your post. Giving a blanket boost to PVP toggle.

It is the same reason people hate free to play pay to win games. You become content for the whales. Maybe I overestimate my PVE comrades, but I would like to believe that we are not so dumb as to fall for such a blatant trick. And if my hopes are not placed wrongly, then the toggle is pointless. No PVE player will play, or if they do...not for long.

The toggle is not a bad idea. But it becomes useless when you propel one mode ahead of the other. Risk versus reward? In games, there is only reward. That is all anyone looks at."
MMORPG,fdn16f7,t1_fdmvpe5,1578574111.0,">Jesus how is this even upvoted, PvPers have to STILL do the same PvE too while doing said PvP, it is literally about rewarding players for doing more content, if you do more you get more.

Exactly, it is like you understand what I am saying...but don't at the same time. IF YOU REWARD ONLY PVP PLAY WITH MORE THAN PVE, WHY WOULD PVE ONLY PLAYERS WANT TO PLAY THE GAME? I like how I have asked that question thrice now...and no one even tries to understand the point. I will cover that point in the next answer so I won't repeat myself. 

> If a PvE player kills 10 mobs and a PvP player 10 mobs and 2 players why shouldn't they get more? 

Is not getting experience from the kills, and even maybe dropped loot not enough for you? You need some bonus EXP and materials too? I have no argument with extra exp and loot from people you kill. But when you apply a bonus on top of that it makes playing the PVE ""toggle"" pointless. Someone else said the game was supposed to be PVP open world. Fine, let it stay that way. But the toggle is made for ONE reason. To get PVE players to want to play the game. Don't even try to deny it was not. They want to appeal to a greater amount of players to make more money. Full Stop. 

However, if you make one toggle (PVP) hugely more advantageous than another toggle...what reason would anyone play the other one? That is my fucking question. In other words...I and others like me have no intention of playing such a game where we are gimped for playing the mode we prefer. And the toggle becomes completely irrelevant."
MMORPG,fdmg944,t1_fdmevo7,1578548875.0,">That make no sense since pvp has extra risk. 

What does that have to do with anything? You don't like PVP enough to just play it for the enjoyment? You need perks to play? Maybe you don't like it as much as you think? 

>Everyone has praised wow for this.

Not everyone. 

>Its all about balance risk vs reward.

It is all about wanting more stuff for free, to play the modes you like the most. 

>Those number were pure estimates.

irrelevant. 


>Imagine the role reversed. That you get extra 20% more XP and +15% extra mats if you toggle off PVP. ***Would that entice you to want to play the game as a PVPer?*** When you are gimped playing the way you like?

What I am getting at here, is...why would a PVEer with no desire to play PVP want to play a game where they would be gimped because they play the way they like? You are only thinking of it from the perspective of a PVPer. The ones who benefit the most. Of course, billionaires love the current economic system of the USA. It makes them rich. Isn't the main reason people don't like pay to win is because they don't like the fact that some get a better advantage than others? Is that not what such a system, you talked about, is doing to the PVE community?"

No. I just wouldn't play the game. You're still looking at it from a PVP perspective. And if players like me don't play the game, then the toggle becomes a lot less useful. I have no intention of playing a game where I fall far behind as a default. PVP players will have no issue because they only enter the mode when they want a break. PVE players will only feel forced to play PVP. Which, is what I think the design is truly about. Making me your content fodder. Who wants to be fodder? 

But it does not matter. Someone else told me that the game is nearly full loot, which changes things to an extent. Makes the toggle forced to have greater rewards for the PVP players, and makes the PVE toggle even less interesting to me. I am out. I hope you enjoy the game."

That answer does not even attempt to answer the question asked. Straw man. You answered, ""Why is the game built the way it is?""

>A large, large portion of the alpha fan base wanted a hardcore pvp game.

No trouble with that. PVP players deserve to have games they enjoy as well. 

>You have to understand that some people just donâ€™t want want youâ€™re describing.

Great I agee. No problem. You have to understand that same principle from the opposite side. Also, my question was not referring to making the game a certain way. I was simply trying to get the idea, that if you make a PVE toggle in a PVP based game, and you make the rewards largely greater in one mode over the other...you make the toggle pointless. Risk versus reward means little in games. The reward is all that really matters. I don't want to write the same thing a third time, so let me, kindly, quote myself:

>In a PVP game with (near) full loot, why is there a toggle? I would argue that it is to entice PVE players to play the game increasing body count as well as revenue. Okay, fair enough. They want to have a stronger audience since full loot games...well tend to not fare that well in the MMORPG market for very long from what I have seen. Well, at least the ones who get serious about world-building.

>Anyway, They want PVE players to come in and help fund the game. So they put in a toggle. So yeah, that is why I am here...the toggle brought interest from me who previously had no interest in the game. ~~But then I see your post~~. Giving a blanket boost to PVP toggle. So then, ~~can't believe I have to answer my own question for you~~, I think...what PVEer would want to play in a mode where you are gimped? I wouldn't. It feels like I am wasting my time. So then, I feel pressured to either play the PVP mode or quit the game. That is the point I am making. The bonus makes the toggle irrelevant. It becomes a masquerade, intending to entice PVEers into a game they normally wouldn't play. Then make the rewards so much better for PVP that they feel pressure to play that mode making those players content for their intended audience. It is the same reason people hate free to play pay to win games. You become content for the whales.

Okay next:

>Most arenâ€™t super jazzed about any sort of toggle in any way.

MMORPG,fdn4uw9,t1_fdmsbqs,1578577333.0,">if you get the number right the average pvp on player won't win more than pve because of ganking.

Right. And I would have no trouble with making PVP kills award exp and even loot drops if the game supports loot drops. But a blanket EXP and bonus mats makes the other toggle irrelevant does it not?

>I just explained this yet you're anwser was irrelevant?

The numbers used are irrelevant to the question I asked originally. Which remains unanswered.

> It's called balancing risk and reward. Same way a harder mobs give better rewards.

Enlighten me, which games give a blanket EXP boost to all modes and extra mats from all things just because you killed a harder enemy earlier in the game? I was not aware of it. Harder enemies give more EXP and have better loot. No doubt. I have no issue with this. But that was not the bonus you talked about in the comment I first responded to. 

>At the end of the day you get the same rewards in both but turning on pvp doesn't become over penalize yoj, forcing you into pve.

I have no issue with a reward system in which you got credit for your PVP kills or even loot from those kills. You earned it. But when you blanket give more to all modes...it makes playing the PVE toggle less rewarding and gimped. Which makes you feel as though you are wasting your time playing that toggle. Which makes you feel forced to play PVP.  The opposite of your argument. You don't want to be forced into PVE, and I don't want to be forced into PVP. 

>You seem not to be able to grasp the increase risk of pvp and even with boost they would still loose way more. This is almost full inventory loot game.

Full loot. I honestly did not know that. That does change things. However, the point I was trying to make with my original question is not changed. Since you have been strawmanning me by answering the question you asked yourself: ""Why does the PVP mode deserve more?"" it would seem as though you have no intention to try and figure that out. Let me clarify.

In a PVP game with (near) full loot, why is there a toggle? I would argue that it is to entice PVE players to play the game increasing body count as well as revenue. Okay, fair enough. They want to have a stronger audience since full loot games...well tend to not fare that well in the MMORPG market for very long from what I have seen.

Maybe I overestimate my PVE comrades, but I would like to believe that we are not so dumb as to fall for such a blatant trick. And if my hopes are not placed wrongly, then the toggle is pointless. No PVE player will play, or if they do...not for long.

The toggle is not a bad idea. But it becomes useless when you propel one mode ahead of the other. Risk versus reward? In games, there is only reward. That is all anyone looks at."
MMORPG,fdn16f7,t1_fdmvpe5,1578574111.0,">Jesus how is this even upvoted, PvPers have to STILL do the same PvE too while doing said PvP, it is literally about rewarding players for doing more content, if you do more you get more.

Exactly, it is like you understand what I am saying...but don't at the same time. IF YOU REWARD ONLY PVP PLAY WITH MORE THAN PVE, WHY WOULD PVE ONLY PLAYERS WANT TO PLAY THE GAME? I like how I have asked that question thrice now...and no one even tries to understand the point. I will cover that point in the next answer so I won't repeat myself. 

> If a PvE player kills 10 mobs and a PvP player 10 mobs and 2 players why shouldn't they get more? 

Is not getting experience from the kills, and even maybe dropped loot not enough for you? You need some bonus EXP and materials too? I have no argument with extra exp and loot from people you kill. But when you apply a bonus on top of that it makes playing the PVE ""toggle"" pointless. Someone else said the game was supposed to be PVP open world. Fine, let it stay that way. But the toggle is made for ONE reason. To get PVE players to want to play the game. Don't even try to deny it was not. They want to appeal to a greater amount of players to make more money. Full Stop. 

However, if you make one toggle (PVP) hugely more advantageous than another toggle...what reason would anyone play the other one? That is my fucking question. In other words...I and others like me have no intention of playing such a game where we are gimped for playing the mode we prefer. And the toggle becomes completely irrelevant."
MMORPG,fdmg944,t1_fdmevo7,1578548875.0,">That make no sense since pvp has extra risk. 

What does that have to do with anything? You don't like PVP enough to just play it for the enjoyment? You need perks to play? Maybe you don't like it as much as you think? 

>Everyone has praised wow for this.

Not everyone. 

>Its all about balance risk vs reward.

It is all about wanting more stuff for free, to play the modes you like the most. 

>Those number were pure estimates.

irrelevant. 


>Imagine the role reversed. That you get extra 20% more XP and +15% extra mats if you toggle off PVP. ***Would that entice you to want to play the game as a PVPer?*** When you are gimped playing the way you like?

What I am getting at here, is...why would a PVEer with no desire to play PVP want to play a game where they would be gimped because they play the way they like? You are only thinking of it from the perspective of a PVPer. The ones who benefit the most. Of course, billionaires love the current economic system of the USA. It makes them rich. Isn't the main reason people don't like pay to win is because they don't like the fact that some get a better advantage than others? Is that not what such a system, you talked about, is doing to the PVE community?"
