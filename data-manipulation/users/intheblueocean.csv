childrensbooks,ffbwxu4,t3_esmpf9,1579785462.0,"My daughter has been on a similar path. The scholastic First Little Reader books have worked well for us. I have her read one out loud with me every day. They start at level A and are short, repeat phrases and the pictures provide clues to the words."
Parents,ff956a4,t3_es8vu3,1579705100.0,How old are they? Have you talked to them to see how they feel? Like if it’s their choice to sit alone or if other kids won’t include them? I think having them each choose some kind of activity to join is a good option to meet other kids with similar interests.
headaches,ff82wxk,t3_es5txj,1579664569.0,What about dental care? Do you still have your wisdom teeth?
Parents,ff80qrd,t3_es4gju,1579662980.0,I would communicate to my child to stay away from that person.

socialanxiety,ff39see,t3_erawyl,1579537029.0,"Yes, and I’ve even had times where people commented on how I walked. Mostly when I was a kid/teen. I looked down, or walked too slow, or looked too tough or held my arms funny. It kind of sucks when you didn’t think you were weird until others pointed it out and now I am overly aware."
Parents,fezwbxn,t3_equ2qi,1579462502.0,"I think it will get easier as your LO gets older. They will be more interested in making friends too and you can meet parents with similar aged kids. Would volunteering be an option or taking a class on a topic you are interested in, like a weekly art class. That could help you get out and meet others doing something besides drinking."
FriendshipAdvice,fea7akg,t3_eo8hmq,1578945191.0,"Could just be busy or not in the mood to hang out that day. But, not necessarily that they never want to hang with you again."
socialanxiety,fdov4oz,t1_fdohe03,1578613572.0,Maybe because there’s no baggage or expectations of each other. I can pretend to have my shit together for 5 minutes lol
Parenting,fdo5iwb,t3_emcsbm,1578599260.0,Not overreacting. You can teach your daughter to be kind to others but also be strong enough to have boundaries.
socialanxiety,fdo2ts6,t3_emc60a,1578597862.0,"I had a nice chat with the cashier at my grocery store, I’m getting to know her. It felt good and she’s the only person I talked to all day. I’m better at talking to strangers than people I know."
FriendshipAdvice,fdnnka7,t3_embhyn,1578589501.0,"The fact that her BF threatened you harm and she said nothing is what bothers me most. If someone threatened my roommate because of my own lie, or any reason really, I would stand up for my roommate. That’s a horrible friend and I’d honestly be looking for a new place to live."

declutter,fb31vd0,t3_eb6grp,1576462310.0,Agree! First I unfollowed a ton of people and groups and most recently I deactivated it. It feels awesome to take a break from it. I pretty much just need it for school info sometimes and can log in if I need to.
