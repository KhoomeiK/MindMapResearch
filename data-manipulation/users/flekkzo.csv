Tax employers for each employee they have, and then earmark that tax to go to the employees choice of health insurance. Create an open market. Then give everyone this, so employment isn’t tied to health care (second biggest scam in the country). Basically collect for everyone. 

Then give everyone the choice of a public option. Nice and free, everyone can buy what they want, and the insurer has to cover all scientifically proven treatments. No chiropractors, faith healers, holistic, goop, etc bullshit that is a waste of money.

Cap all the insurance companies at max 20% of the people in the state. Forced competition works, otherwise we get a monopoly. Except the public option.

Tax employers for each employee they have, and then earmark that tax to go to the employees choice of health insurance. Create an open market. Then give everyone this, so employment isnâ€™t tied to health care (second biggest scam in the country). Basically collect for everyone. 

Then give everyone the choice of a public option. Nice and free, everyone can buy what they want, and the insurer has to cover all scientifically proven treatments. No chiropractors, faith healers, holistic, goop, etc bullshit that is a waste of money.

Cap all the insurance companies at max 20% of the people in the state. Forced competition works, otherwise we get a monopoly. Except the public option. 

Thatâ€™s how I think it should be done. Universal healthcare is doomed to fail (where) if itâ€™s part of the budget. The second the republicans get the budget they will defunded it heavily (like they did with Medicare and Medicaid) and cry MAGA and come up with a worse system."
