You and these authors are just being dishonest. Even president obamas advisors said this analysis was severely flawed.  How can the EITC be treated as anything but a credit of taxes?  It’s in the fucking name!


Mr Zucman countered that his and Mr Saez’s analysis considers the EITC and other credits like it as transfers of income, akin to food stamps or jobless benefits, rather than tax provisions.

“If you start counting some transfers as negative taxes, it is not clear where to stop,” he said via email. “Do you treat the EITC as a negative tax? Veterans’ benefits? Medicaid? Defence spending? ... There’s no clear line, and the results become arbitrary.”"
