study,ferjwnr,t3_eqg41g,1579354829.0,"According to my therapist, it's pretty darn hard but there are ways to improve the outcome. 
She urged me to study at the library as often as I could. Otherwise, if you can't go there at times, then you have to study at home. 
For that she recommends: study with headphones on and listen to calming music. Earplugs, if you can't study while listening to music. Close the door of your room and keep it closed. Lock it if you can. Lock some food and drinks in with you as well. Don't let anyone into your zone. Don't talk to them, because they might trick you into an argument and then the day's ruined. Don't even give them a chance to argue with you by being as passive as possible 
(worked for my kind of people). 
Meditate: you're calm, you can do this, this doesn't stop you from being successful, this doesn't define you, they're not you, you're better than this. Things like that. 

Stay focused, you can do this!"
YouShouldKnow,ferftre,t1_fereyja,1579353359.0,"No clue, also it were only scraps. They would end mid sentence and make no sense. Maybe they got it because WhatsApp puts it's save files in Google drive."
YouShouldKnow,feq33ke,t1_feomd03,1579336916.0,"I know. Found it strange, too."
YouShouldKnow,feo8oi2,t3_eq3b71,1579296663.0,"I did that last year and it was boring, except the short audio files that they had saved from when I was talking shit about my ex to my best friend in 2015. Still don't know what they had planned with them. They were from WhatsApp."
relationship_advice,fdj43er,t1_fdj3rnj,1578457909.0,"I could wait it out until mid April, then I have to move to his place, because I'm actually starting my master's degree then. The situation sucks."
relationship_advice,fdj1jye,t1_fdizp13,1578456068.0,"That's actually his reasoning. ""Doesn't like the feeling"". Kinda sad, actually, that he wouldn't take daily meds for me. I'll address this issue, he's not the fastest thinker, so maybe he really didn't notice this unevenness."
relationship_advice,fdj0ywr,t1_fdizyvt,1578455664.0,"He hasn't. Apparently a neighbour's cat got into his room when he was little and he had a severe allergic reaction. Since then he stays away from cats. Now, he only has rather mild reactions. His eyes get itchy and his nose starts running. 
I suspect it's partially psychosomatic, because sometimes when he stays at my place, there's no reaction for way too long. Then suddenly his eyes start getting red. But they do sometimes when there's no cat around, too. I've told told him my suspicion, but he doesn't want to go into detail. He says it's nonsense. He's allergic and that's it."
relationship_advice,fdiz5fe,t1_fdixsg7,1578454405.0,That's an option. Let's see how this'll go first.
relationship_advice,fdiywuf,t1_fdiyrk1,1578454240.0,"That's a thing? I'll have to get more info on that one, thanks a lot!"
relationship_advice,fdiysmp,t1_fdiyjtq,1578454160.0,"Ha. Probably just be nice to him and tell him I'll stop taking the pill. See how he'll feel about that one. Been annoying me anyway, y'know, taking pills daily. Lol."
relationship_advice,fdiyi80,t1_fdiy747,1578453961.0,"Nah, he's been acting childish on a few occasions already. I've accepted it as a part of him. However, I refuse to leave behind pets I love more than myself for a guy who refuses to take counter bought allergy meds."
relationship_advice,fdiycdt,t1_fdixnhd,1578453851.0,"We live 2 hours apart, so he already stayed at my place for 1 week at one. If he takes meds, he has no symptoms. I don't get what his problems with taking meds is. I feel like he's just a bit entitled or how you call it, I'm not a native speaker."
relationship_advice,fdiy55x,t1_fdixvcn,1578453713.0,Exactly. I hope he'll come to the same conclusion thou...
relationship_advice,fdixz88,t1_fdixruc,1578453603.0,YES. This!
relationship_advice,fdixv0v,t1_fdixdpz,1578453524.0,"Technically I'm moving in with him. So I'm bringing the cats to him. But yeah, it wasn't a problem until a few weeks ago. 
Suddenly it is."
