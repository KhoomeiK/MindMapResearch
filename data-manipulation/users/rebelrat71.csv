RATS,ff4qce4,t3_erf7t9,1579569898.0,The best part is when they‚Äôre about 3-4 weeks old and they start hopping or ‚Äòpopcorning‚Äô when they play. I love that age.
RATS,ff35ohh,t1_ff2k1h5,1579534279.0,It‚Äôs funny because the agouti -his name is Rufus- is usually a bit more dominant. But the white guy -Oscar- sometimes has to show his brother that he‚Äôs not in charge. Rat hierarchy is interesting to watch.
cats,fehmaqz,t3_ep29mu,1579119433.0,Sounds like my smoke detector if I burn something.
cats,fehlw8v,t1_feh4e6i,1579119201.0,My kitten agrees with this.
cats,feergrg,t3_eoow31,1579039634.0,She‚Äôs definitely model material. Look at that beauty.

RATS,fdzoxgg,t3_enbfr5,1578792589.0,That is one good looking little birthday boy.
RATS,fdy5ei5,t1_fdy4bsx,1578776276.0,"Awww, I love her. üòç"
RATS,fdy37ti,t3_en1q4g,1578775575.0,Not plain at all. She‚Äôs beautiful and I want to kiss her little head.
cats,fdt4tw5,t3_en1qdo,1578711932.0,I had a very anxious cat who used to barber herself and I got her on anti-anxiety meds at the vet. It was the difference between night and day. She stopped over grooming and all her hair grew back.  She was also so much happier and calmer.
cats,fdt47r7,t3_en1rjm,1578711698.0,This is so pure.
RATS,fdrkift,t1_fdqtpz4,1578685759.0,I was really hoping to see that too. Haha.
aww,fdq5fyl,t3_empowv,1578655676.0,"I love when they‚Äôre little like that, and they have absolutely zero control over what their ears do. üòÇ"
cats,fdpm66v,t3_emm6cm,1578632542.0,"Hi Samson. I just adopted a new kitty myself today. So glad you have a furever home, handsome."
cats,fdplzhu,t1_fdpluwk,1578632382.0,Thank you. He really is a good looking little guy.
boston,fdpl0p5,t3_embt5n,1578631559.0,"Best, most original proposal ever. Congrats to you both."
aww,fdmc2o0,t3_em4sdc,1578545191.0,I need him. üòç
cats,fdjwqbf,t1_fdio9t7,1578489957.0,It‚Äôs amazing when they learn to trust.
cats,fdio1vs,t1_fdinsuy,1578447201.0,"The way she‚Äôs looking at you like you‚Äôre her everything is so sweet, too."
cats,fdinp9r,t3_elldfc,1578446981.0,She‚Äôs beautiful.
CatsBitingThings,fdfoipc,t3_ekzluh,1578366451.0,Who needs a hole punch?
RATS,fdd8kja,t1_fdd7wy0,1578299752.0,"Oscar, the PEW isn‚Äôt the dominant one. He just loves his bro. They both love each other. They‚Äôre extremely bonded."
StartledCats,fcze0oo,t1_fcxm07o,1578099075.0,"This is my first time seeing it, and I‚Äôm crying. I watched it like 14 times in a row. üòÇ"

CatsBitingThings,fcsrq5p,t3_eidow0,1577923427.0,It‚Äôs nice when cats support the LGBTQ community.
RATS,fcp5kh2,t1_fcozzxc,1577851181.0,"Personal opinion. Dumbo rats have a different kind of cuteness factor than top-eared rats. I love all my rats equally, but I‚Äôve always had a soft spot for dumbo rats."
RATS,fcoyb65,t3_ei9s8m,1577844950.0,What a smart little thing. ‚ù§Ô∏è
aww,fco6314,t1_fco5cu5,1577824775.0,Me too. I was bummed there was no sound.
guineapigs,fco5wct,t3_eh7bgi,1577824675.0,"Aww, I‚Äôm so sorry. He was such a cutie. I haven‚Äôt had a guinea pig since I was a kid. May I ask what their normal lifespan is?"
pics,fco5ed6,t1_fco5836,1577824407.0,Agreed. I‚Äôm sorry to hear of their loss.
pics,fco4va5,t1_fco4b6a,1577824120.0,"It just amazes me that they risk their lives for people they‚Äôll most likely never meet and to save wildlife and property. I live in the US, and the state of California has horrific fires as well. Our first responders often work 24 hours at a time with very little to no rest. I say they‚Äôre heroes even when they say they‚Äôre just doing their jobs. Firefighters are very special people."
aww,fco4cw9,t3_ei89de,1577823843.0,She‚Äôs beautiful. Hello from the state of Colorado in the United States. ‚ù§Ô∏è

aww,fcn37pc,t1_fcgpphg,1577802010.0,I just looked that up. I never knew there was an actual name and treatment for that condition. Sounds miserable for poor cats affected by it.
CatsBitingThings,fcn2qnu,t3_ehna6w,1577801627.0,Maybe it‚Äôs a cats way of flossing.
RATS,fcm3ewv,t3_ehuhka,1577763210.0,Oh hai!
AnimalsBeingBros,fcm36kq,t3_ehughm,1577763037.0,And I hope you‚Äôre feeling better soon.
AnimalsBeingBros,fcm2xhb,t3_ehughm,1577762850.0,"I had pneumonia a few weeks ago, and my boy cuddled with me the whole time. He‚Äôs always a sweet cat, but he was more attentive than usual then. He knew I felt horrible."

RATS,fcb2iaj,t3_egvzcc,1577581448.0,Gorgeous boy.
ferrets,fc5wx4f,t3_eg5ktk,1577467617.0,"It could just be the perspective of the camera, but he looks huge. Handsome guy."
RATS,fc5dkpk,t3_eg51kl,1577454342.0,I can‚Äôt even with this. I just squeed all over myself. üòç
cats,fc3c60i,t3_efv51j,1577386549.0,Beautiful!
