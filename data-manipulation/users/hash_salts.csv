Then what was the last sentence about.

Again, from what I've read the only clarity has been in _opinion_ and not based in fact. To say, and emphasize ""nobody"" is factually untrue. Regardless of what we believe happened, there is I'm fact at least one party that is arguing that sentiment; unfound or not.



>Its also why I'm taking the words of multiple experts who have given official statements that it was a shootdown, and such an explosion is not possible in any normal failure state that has been blamed.

Three people that are basing their opinions on the same media we have seen.

Fine. Maybe. I'm in no position to speak to what happens when an aircraft fails and you, admittedly are not either.

I guess. Idk. See my last point.

Right but who knows until review of that assessment.

That's literally my only point.

>There is a point where basing the entire response on waiting for that statement is just a waste of time.

Yeah, if we were a nation's military I'd totally agree. We aren't. We're Redditors speculating on the matter. Civilians with nothing to add but confusion.

>Especially in a situation like this, where there is likely never going to be an official confirmation because the alleged perpetrator will never hand over the needed evidence.

There surely will be, see the last Ukrainian passenger plain shot down.

>At that point, any official confirmation is as good as what I'm doing here, since its based on the same information.

I'm literally arguing what you are doing here is not based on the same evidence and *it is not good enough*"

If I got some quality reps that I just thought looked cool (nothing to hyped) and wore them around my north east US major city would I have to worry about strangers giving me shit on the street? I know some people get really into sneakers.

Sorry if this isn't the appropriate place for the question. I didn't see anything in the wiki and didn't think this justified a post.

Edit: seems the consensus is only high school kids might give strangers shit. Thanks for the replies all, I'm excited to start some research and find myself an affordable pair of nice sneakers! This community seems like there's a bunch of good people in it."

Ok.

>I know enough about the technical aspects to be able to understand and keep up however.

Fine.

>Not that any of the statements so far have dealt with anything technical.

Then what was the last sentence about.

>They've just been very clear in their language that nobody believes this was an accident.

Again, from what I've read the only clarity has been in _opinion_ and not based in fact. To say, and emphasize ""nobody"" is factually untrue. Regardless of what we believe happened, there is I'm fact at least one party that is arguing that sentiment; unfound or not.



>Its also why I'm taking the words of multiple experts who have given official statements that it was a shootdown, and such an explosion is not possible in any normal failure state that has been blamed.

Three people that are basing their opinions on the same media we have seen.

>The video shows it exploding as it falls, not only as it hits.

Fine. Maybe. I'm in no position to speak to what happens when an aircraft fails and you, admittedly are not either.

>That's not something that happens in something like an aircraft without external influence.

I guess. Idk. See my last point.



>Especially one that had just passed very stringent inspections days before.

Right but who knows until review of that assessment.

>Again, I understand the need for an official confirmation.

That's literally my only point.

>There is a point where basing the entire response on waiting for that statement is just a waste of time.

Yeah, if we were a nation's military I'd totally agree. We aren't. We're Redditors speculating on the matter. Civilians with nothing to add but confusion.

>Especially in a situation like this, where there is likely never going to be an official confirmation because the alleged perpetrator will never hand over the needed evidence.

There surely will be, see the last Ukrainian passenger plain shot down.

>At that point, any official confirmation is as good as what I'm doing here, since its based on the same information.

I'm literally arguing what you are doing here is not based on the same evidence and *it is not good enough*"
