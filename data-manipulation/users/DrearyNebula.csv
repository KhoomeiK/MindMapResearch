Conservative,ffdjabe,t1_ffc4ful,1579822060.0,"Ontario went liberal because Doug Ford, the conservative leader, fucked everything sideways, and then spat on it for good measure. You can’t bitch about them voting for the lesser of two evils. The GTA has 25 seats, and it has more people than the entirety of Alberta. Deal with it. Andrew Scheer himself was useless, even his own party hated him. 
This is not to say that trudeau isn’t a fucking hilarity of a shitty PM who plays identity politics at every point, and over obsesses over climate change. He is undoubtedly terrible. But do not blame Canada for weak conservative leadership. I guarantee had there been a more capable leader we would have went blue, which would be much better."

MUN,ffaramp,t3_erz9mm,1579742654.0,"I get you’re struggle. Canada has the biggest nuclear reactors in the world, and often sells energy to the US, especially New York. Knowing that you are at the forefront of such energy technologies, be the leader in the committee. Establish yourself as the person willing to lead the committee for the solutions that you have. Canada, specifically Ontario, has an excellent energy record and one of the cleanest. It will undoubtedly be very hard to achieve, but is possible. 
Good luck"
MUN,ffaqq3z,t3_esev7r,1579742268.0,"Im going to assume you’re talking about what is generally called crisis simulations. I have participated and chaired a few. 

1. One topic is best. If it is a deep, complex topic, even better. This allows delegates to specialise in what they want to do and built momentum as things progress. 

2. Set a topic that is only lightly scripted. Think of it as writing a code for a simulation. You set the rules, they play the game. Often times certain conferences can have horrible topics such as the cuban missile crisis. This leads to certain delegates having an advantage that may be unaccessible to other delegates simply because of outside knowledge. Generally in a crisis that should be avoided because it is not indicative of their skills as a delegate but rather their broad sense of knowledge. Use a topic such as the lost colony of roanoke. A mysterious topic that each delegate can approach differently, and you can certainly add elements which play to your advantage like dark magic or witches. 

3. Adapt. Do not come in with specific expectations, often times delegates will completely surprise you with directives that you did not see coming. 

4. Make them adapt. Throw random, crazy shit at them. I remember I was in a Brexit committee and in the middle of negotiations prince Harry was kidnapped to Ireland by the IRA.
