nostalgia,ffh4gk5,t1_ffgq6z2,1579922858.0,Worked at an Embassy Suite breakfast buffet and we’d have to put a piece of kale and a slice of orange on each plate. Was so confused when I left the country and years later came back and it was a food.
technology,fffn883,t1_fff63rq,1579887595.0,"Also, it better come sooner than later. I live in a city where the police doesn’t do shit and the DA does even less. Everyone complaining about facial recognition likely is not suffering from crime on a daily basis."
aznidentity,ffa5ytn,t3_es9m9z,1579728538.0,Seriously. It’s Piers Morgan. He’s a known racist/asshole/jerk face/shill/Trump boogeyman. His bosses don’t care. This is really grasping for straws.
aznidentity,fewvhlt,t3_eqre25,1579420129.0,So basically we are applauding and/or encouraging foreign support in our elections. Let’s be clear about that.

CompetitiveTFT,fetmzsj,t3_eqfzwl,1579377017.0,"I would have to say this is one of the most pared down subs I subscribe to. I don’t think we are at a saturation point with redundant posts.

To the contrary, as several others have mentioned, these posts often solicit useful feedback for everyone. And since the meta changes so frequently, it’s usually fresh content.

Let’s resist the temptation to start whining about noobs, we kinda have a good thing going here."
wholesomememes,feoslbe,t3_eq4qmq,1579304826.0,"Wtf is wrong with people. Does this look at all real to you? Why would “Date me” be printed on the card, and “or draw 25” handwritten?

“Date me” is clearly (poorly) photoshopped over whatever hand writing was there before. y’all are stupid"
millionairemakers,feooabl,t3_eq81a8,1579302949.0,We’re all winners already
4hourbodyslowcarb,fehtiuk,t3_ep7q7k,1579123569.0,"This is going to be the unpopular opinion here but being kind to yourself and mental health is equally important as being in physical shape.

If you need comfort, comfort yourself.

Cut yourself some slack, and if you slip, need a break, that’s ok. Each time you pick yourself and get back on it you will be further instilling the importance you have chosen to place on maintaining a healthy diet."
videos,fecz8em,t1_feb0r9f,1578990822.0,I am not easily amused and my stomach hurts from laughing so hard.
DeepIntoYouTube,fdukrvh,t1_fdt8rat,1578734457.0,"He’s not dead. I’ve seen this happen, on a train, to someone having a seizure. Went stiff as a board and slid off the seat, just like a plank, onto the floor.

Was conscious, though confused, later on."
depression,fde2zv7,t1_fddm00b,1578330031.0,"Parents are human too and they come with flaws. Sorry, your parents might love you but they are acting like fools. They probably are trying their best. They are probably reflecting the same flaws *their* parents imposed upon *them* and they probably don’t realize it, even though when they were your age they swore they’d never be like that.

Or maybe not. The point is, once you realize they are flawed and your happiness as an adult does not depend on them *at all* maybe you can forgive them and be more independent. Good luck."
mildlyinteresting,fdct6r1,t1_fdbygk4,1578283617.0,Why doesn’t every school / office have one of these? Lol
AskReddit,fd6j0ja,t1_fd5pfxb,1578191778.0,"Many cases get overturned regardless. People still go to jail, long enough to accumulate mental injury."
depression,fd6ippd,t3_ek3uky,1578191642.0,"These things do happen, maybe to all of us in some way. Unimaginable how a friend or family member could stab you in the back but it does happen and we’ve dealt with it. 

Removing them from your life, even temporarily, would remove what sounds like heaps of negative influence. Cut them off and look forward to your better life!"

videos,fcoyyft,t1_fcoqu6k,1577845478.0,"I assume your actual reasoning is that you think it’s funny, so therefore it’s ok (and NOT racist.) You’re not the first. Yeah whatever, if you think this is funny, you’ll have bigger issues to deal with. No thanks bruh"

videos,fcomx5e,t1_fcod60g,1577836249.0,"I’m with you. A big mistake for sure, everyone who finds this funny should be ashamed. It’s not only blatantly racist, but also cruel to the victims and survivors to make a joke out of the whole thing. America really sucks sometimes and also yeah bring on the downvote brigade."
occult,fcm1vi0,t3_ehlyo7,1577762058.0,Would love to buy some!
