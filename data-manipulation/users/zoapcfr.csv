BeardedDragons,fgtvsdy,t1_fgsw2z7,1581110013.0,"I've heard it should be closer to 2 hours, so even 45 minutes seems a little short to me. Also, make sure the basking spot temperature is being checked. It should have a surface temperature of about 40-42C, as measured with an infrared thermometer gun. If it's too low, that would also cause the same problem. 

This could be the issue, because everything else that can cause smell issues seems to be taken care of. They really shouldn't have any smell themselves, and their faeces should only make the room smell for ~30 minutes at most after being cleaned up, and the smell shouldn't even escape the enclosure until it's opened. I've always been pretty squeamish when it comes to smells (having roommates while at uni was a nightmare with the mess some left in the kitchen), so the potential smell was my main concern before getting my beardie. But I actually haven't had any issues at all, and happily share my bedroom with him. 

Just one other thing to check; I know you say you clean the enclosure daily, but is this routine or is it to specifically clean up faeces? You (or ideally, your wife since she got him) should clean it up as soon as you see it, both for smell and hygiene. As long as this ""spot cleaning"" is done well, you shouldn't need to do routine cleans very often, especially if you have a tile substrate. If it's being left until a routine daily clean, then that could be the issue."

Also consider using waxworms as a treat too, if you don't already. They're very soft, so any size is fine and you won't have to worry about an impaction risk. You still need to avoid giving him one too often, as they have a lot of fat in them, but they're great as occasional treats."

Whether it was caused maliciously by someone else or by an actual malfunction, treating equipment like that, and with such explosive anger, is not at all acceptable. I definitely wouldn't want someone who behaved like that working for me (or with me). If I can't trust someone not to lose their cool while working around potentially dangerous equipment, I don't want anything to do with them. 

As for the guy blocking his view, that's also a safety concern and as such must be treated harshly, but it's less of a personality issue. He's not losing control of himself, he's just taking a joke too far/doing it at the wrong time. Unlike the other guy, there's a good chance this can be corrected by having a serious discussion with him (assuming it's the first time he's done this sort of thing)."

If you go for a loose substrate, you should get normal soft/fine play sand, or you can mix normal soft/fine play sand with some topsoil. You'll still need to make sure he doesn't eat any food off the loose substrate, so you'll have to do all his live feeds in a feeding box. You'll also need to completely change it all every couple of weeks or so, otherwise you'll get a buildup of bacteria, even with spot cleaning. 

It's much easier and safer to avoid loose substrates, especially if you're not an experienced owner. If you want to give him the option of digging, you can occasionally put a dig box in his enclosure."

I believe that's just another name for calciworms (Hermetia illucens), which are great due to their high calcium content, which is why I listed it as an appropriate staple. I'm not aware of any other kind of worm that can be used as a staple, but please correct me if there is. Still, there's many other worms that are great as treats as part of a varied diet (for example, waxworms)."
AskReddit,fgjzsqb,t1_fgjpbwp,1580854607.0,"For me, I think it depends. If it's a case of them being on their phone while I'm actually talking, or getting it out 3 times a minute, then yeah I'm done.

BeardedDragons,fgjxuvj,t3_eyxalz,1580853518.0,"Ideally you should have a tube style UVB (I assume you meant UVB and not UVA) that is 2/3 the length of the enclosure, but you may as well wait until you upgrade the enclosure (since that's soon anyway). 

The ""night heat bulb"" looks like it emits light, so it's no good. If you need night time heating, you should use a ceramic heat emitter, as light will disturb their sleep. Heating pads are strongly advised against because they are not good at judging temperature from below and can burn themselves. 

The sand can be fine (assuming it's not calcisand), but any live food that cannot be contained in his bowl will need to be fed outside the enclosure, as he should not be eating off the sand. 

Is that the ambient hot side temperature or basking spot temperature? If it's the basking spot temperature, that's way too cold. If it's ambient, then it sounds about right, but you still need to be checking the basking spot surface temperature with an infrared thermometer gun, as that's the important one. Those stick-on/gauge thermometers are terribly unreliable, so if you want to measure ambient temperatures, I recommend a digital probe thermometer. The night time temperature seems a little high. You only need a ceramic heat emitter if temperatures drop below ~21C at night. 

While space may not be an issue with that enclosure size (at the moment), I'd worry about getting a good temperature gradient. They need to be able to move to a cooler area to control their temperature. What is the temperature on the cool side?"
BeardedDragons,fgjvsyz,t1_fgjbw54,1580852364.0,"Die as in soon? No, that's an overreaction. But he may develop poor health and will likely have a lower life expectancy than he otherwise would if the only live food he eats is treats. Mealworms also carry a higher risk of impaction if you feed too many (particularly to younger beardies), but that's not too much of an issue for an adult. 

I would recommend cutting out all worms for a while and only offer greens and appropriate staple insects (dubia roaches, locusts, crickets, calciworms). It may take a week or so until he's motivated into trying them, since they can survive for extended periods without food, so don't give up too soon. It can be very hard to get them out of bad eating habits, but it's in their best interests to do so. The key to a good diet is variety, so try to give him as many healthy options as possible. Once he's on a healthier diet, you can still use mealworms as treats. 

He's right about the spinach and lettuce though. Spinach is basically anti-calcium, so you just don't want that in their diet; it does them no good. Lettuce is okay if you need to get more water into them, just as long as you think of it as a drink rather than a food as there's practically no nutrition in there."

Similarly, I don't understand the ones that say you have to force them to stay in their enclosure until they do it before letting them out. What does that accomplish?

Just get them out when you see the signs, let them go (watch and put them on paper towels if needed), then you can both get on with your day."
BeardedDragons,fgdt31p,t1_fgdlh0s,1580686549.0,"I looked up the substrate and it does appear to be a sand and soil mix, so should be fine. I might actually get some myself for a dig box. Oh yeah, they need calcium, it just needs to be on their food and not in their substrate. 

A feeding box can be handy regardless of substrate, as it saves you having to hunt around for escaped insects if they don't all get eaten (all must be removed after 10-15 minutes), though this will only really become an issue when you upgrade his enclosure to something bigger (I wouldn't enjoy trying to grab a bunch of locusts out of my beardie's enclosure, and I'm sure I'd miss some)."
BeardedDragons,fgdmlps,t3_exw72n,1580684097.0,"For greens, mine likes rocket, pak choi, squash, spring greens, cabbage greens, coriander, watercress, and kale. I always make sure there's some fresh greens available for him throughout the day. I only give him fruit once a day at most, as otherwise it's too much water which just comes out with the next bowel movement. So far he's just had blueberries, grapes, and strawberries. 

Mealworms and morio (super) worms can both be used as treats, but are not appropriate staples. Mealworms have less nutrition per indigestible shell, so are a greater risk of impaction, but morio worms are large so should not be fed to juveniles. As an alternative treat, you can use waxworms, which are both soft and small enough to be appropriate for all beardies."
BeardedDragons,fgdkq8p,t3_exw7vy,1580683471.0,"That looks like a T8 UVB tube (not a T5 at least) so it'll need to be mounted inside, preferably with a reflector. 

The basking spot needs to be about 40-42C, and maybe even a little higher for babies. If you're just using the thermometer in the picture, you won't be able to tell. For the basking spot, you need to be measuring surface temperature, so you'll need an infrared thermometer gun. The thermometer in the picture shouldn't even be trusted for ambient temperatures either, as they're known for being unreliable. Digital probe thermometers are far better for checking hot and cool end ambient temperatures. 

Loose substrate is fine if you do it right. I don't know what you've got, but appropriate ones are either soft/fine play sand, or the same sand mixed with topsoil (this is what it looks like, but that's just a guess). Never use calci-sand or anything with calcium in it, as you don't want them eating it. You'll need to make sure he never eats off of it, so keep all food in the food bowl, and for things you can't contain to the food bowl, you'll have to feed him outside the enclosure in a feeding box. If there is topsoil in the mix, then make sure it doesn't raise the humidity too much (it should be no higher than 40-50%; the lower the better).

BeardedDragons,fgdgtne,t1_fgdde9z,1580682340.0,"Mealworms and fruit are both treats only. I'm worried about the lack of mention of fresh greens, which should be the main part of their (adult) diet.

You have to make sure to go to a trusted herp vet. Unfortunately, some vets that have no idea will say they can treat them because it's easy money, and people use them because they're cheaper than a proper herp vet. 

In the mean time, at least see if you can get that enclosure cleaned; it looks disgusting. These guys shouldn't smell at all unless they've just had a bowel movement. If possible, check the UVB that's being used. It should be a long tube style, at least 10% UVB, and must be replaced every 6 months. Without this, any calcium supplements won't be absorbed. I recommend getting the 14% from Arcadia since he almost certainly has MBD, as this will aid recovery."

2. Yes, mealworms are treats, and can be risky to feed to younger ones because they're hard to digest which could lead to impaction. Waxworms are a safer treat (but still don't feed too many). If you mean live feedings when you say 4 times a week, that's for adults. Babies that small will need 3 live feedings every day; they eat a lot of bugs when they're growing. Crickets are an appropriate staple, though I'd say they're really not great to 'farm'. I don't even like buying them (I go for locusts instead) because they make noise, they smell, they're difficult to handle, and they die easier than other insects. Dubia roaches are much easier to farm, and are a great staple. They barely smell of anything, they can't climb smooth surfaces, they make no noise, they're easy to handle, they pretty hardy, and all they need to breed is a little heat. Dubia roaches are pretty expensive, so it also makes financial sense to start a colony, whereas locusts/crickets/mealworms are cheap enough to buy as needed. 

3. The one thing I was unprepared for was accommodation for all the insects. If you can't keep many of them in good conditions, you'll get a lot dying on you and you'll have to keep going out to buy more. Once you've got lots of room to store them, you can buy in bulk and have barely any dying on you. And the longer you have them, the bigger they grow, so even if you're not breeding them, you're saving money by raising them to be bigger. Just be careful they don't get too big for the baby beardie (they should be smaller than the distance between his eyes)."

Traffic must be hell in cars that can't idle in first (or second) gear. It's such a normal part of driving in traffic that I know that my current car idles at 3-4mph in first gear, and 7-8mph in second gear (depending on the incline). 

It's also worth noting that when driving in snow/ice (when the roads conditions are very poor), you're meant to stick to second gear only, and once you get moving you leave it to idle."

Heat pads are advised against, as they aren't good at judging heat from below and can get burned. If the temperature drops below ~21C at night, you should use a ceramic heat emitter instead, as they're far safer. 

Unfortunately, there's not really a cheap option for UVB. It's not something you'd want to risk going cheap on anyway, as you have no way of verifying if they're actually putting out the UVB they claim. The main brands to look for are Arcadia and Reptisun, the former of which actually offer bulbs above the minimum 10% UVB output that they need (worth knowing in case you suspect early symptoms of MBD).

BeardedDragons,ffl0pjy,t3_eu3cx2,1580032670.0,"Depends on how young you get him. I got mine at 3 months old, and he had no problem in his adult sized enclosure straight away, and I didn't need to make any changes. However, I've seen some places that sell them disturbingly young (look like they're only a couple of weeks old in some cases), so you may need to make sure there aren't high places he can fall off and that he can move around from the hot end to the cool end. Once you've done that, there shouldn't be any issues with an enclosure being ""too big"". 

As for being too small, all should be appropriate but for different times. They grow quickly, so I wouldn't want one older than a month or so in a 10 gallon, and 20 is probably starting to get too small for a 3-4 month old. 40 should be good up until they're almost fully grown. But really I'd suggest saving yourself the time, money, and effort, and just get a single adult appropriate enclosure right from the beginning."
BeardedDragons,ffkzj5j,t3_eu13sz,1580032040.0,"I can't tell which light is which or if there are more above the picture. Assuming there isn't and the one on the left is the UVB, you should move the basking spot to one side. There needs to be a cool end and a hot end. I'd also recommend having the basking spot higher, mounting the lights higher if needed, as they like to bask high up (such as where he is on the hammock). 

Throw away the compact UVB, as they only have very limited coverage and have also been linked to eye problems. Replace it with a tube UVB that spans at least half the enclosure (and overlaps with the basking spot). 

He should have a hide available, so there's somewhere dark and hidden that he can go to if he wants. 

The lighting changes will depend a lot on how you're temperatures are looking. Do you have an infrared thermometer gun to check surface temperature of the basking spot? Because those stick-on/gauge thermometers are really unreliable, and only measure (or attempt to measure) ambient temperature, so you'd need at least one other way to check temperature. Assuming the lights haven't just turned on, and that thermometer is roughly correct, the temperature seems worryingly low, which would explain why he's so dark."

When you get it checked, you can make adjustments by moving the basking spot closer and further from the basking lamp. You can also get a dimmer plug or dimming thermostat to fine tune it, though if it is too low at full power, you'd need to get a higher wattage bulb first (and make sure the lamp is rated to take a higher wattage bulb before changing it)."

Yes, it's normal for a change in environment to cause stress, so don't worry and just give him some time. When using all-glass enclosures, it's recommended to cover 3 sides to reduce stress from him seeing his reflection, so that may help.
