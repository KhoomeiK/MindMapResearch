You can't easily judge people for worrying about their livelyhood getting ruined. What is the first thing an office worker to worry about when their job is at stake? The orphanage that is about to shut down and leave kids to the streets? The blazzing fires that contiounsly engulf a country that is oceans apart from you? A war that doesn't even concern or affect them in anyway possible?

I respect you if in your case you would worry about the latter and risk your job just so you can worry about others. But the average person would still worry about their own livelyhood because its what's important to them right now, they've dedicated a lot of time and work for it and they don't want all that hard work to just crumble like that. Doesn't matter what kind of job they do. Making youtube videos or writing codes. W/e it is, if it's still a job to them then it is important. I wish you would understand that at least.

Maybe once you've dedicated a good portion of time on something you love or even if its just work and suddenly it's all looking like it's going to get ruined for no good reason, you might understand.

I see you've made a new sub. Wouldn't you hate it if the admins just remove it for w/e reason? You dedicate your time to make it good, putting in content etc. then suddenly it's gone? In your point of view it shouldn't matter because there are fires in australia and iran is in war, they should be the most important things to pay attention to, nothing else. But if you truly do care it will bother you. All that text you put up and suddenly admins say ""No"" and it's all gone. Everyone has something to care about even if it doesn't effect the world, and its important to them. I'm sure you'll agree that you are no exception!"
