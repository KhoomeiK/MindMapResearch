Dude you and I are the same. I get very attached, and I overshare way too much, too quickly. I've always been very lonely too. And that long distance girlfriend I mentioned, she just vanished on me, without any explanation whatsoever. I ended it after 2 or 3 months of not hearing a word from her, and didn't even get a reply to that. So as a result of the way my life has been, I've developed trust, intimacy and dependency issues. I can't seem to help it so honestly I've kind of accepted that it's just what I'm like.

I was in a super long distance relationship for a while, vears ago. Sadly it ended before we could meet up (as romantic partners, long story). But this makes me wonder/worry if that's been what it would've been like when we finally did. Scares me a lot to think about.

I can very much relate, in that I get attached to possible romantic interests easily, and I get very hopeful about the future we might have together. It's not that I'm naive, I'm just desperate.

I don't know whether I'm a good person or not tbh. Truth is I can't find any reasons to want to be better. Hopelessness lends itself to selfishness. But you're largely right. If you look at the world objectively, it's impossible to believe that people earn their fortune. It's just luck. The only counterargument I'd put forward to that, is that by acting better, your self-esteem ought to increase, which will make you more likely to have the confidence to do things/take risks which could potentially improve your quality of life and make you happier. But confidence, self-esteem and the belief that you deserve good things can still only do so much for you. The law of attraction and all that bullshit really means nothing if you're not standing it on the shoulders of good luck. It can help though, and I'm definitely not suggesting that I'm the most unlucky/powerless person on earth. I'm just very cynical of people who believe that destiny is fair or beneficent. But anyway that was a rant.

Thank you. I actually found someone on here recently who I've been talking to a lot. We get along really well and we've already built quite a trusting friendship, where we can confide in each other about pretty much anything. Even though it's just an online friendship, it feels crazy good, after not having anyone like that for a long time.

I'm really trying to make new friends. But I don't really know how. It's really hard when you're an adult, you're not going to school and you don't have social hobbies. I'm thankful for the internet, it opens up a lot more opportunities for finding people with similar personalities and common interests, and I'm pretty introverted and I love communicating in writing so it's not a dealbreaker to me if I can never hang out with the person.

I have a dog! And I had a cat. I love and deeply respect animals, and I would give the same recommendation to anyone in my shoes. Animals are fucking awesome. They remind me that it's okay to have a simple life, and that a lot of our unhappiness is caused by our expectations.

But it sounds like some people only have to have one attempt to make the permanent decision that they want to live. I guess it shocks them back to life, or gives them a permanent fear of dying which is more intense than their wish for their pain to end. And if that occurs then I can't help but feel like their attempt might have kind of been a good thing for them, if they're happier and coping better long-term as a result of it.
