Not a pizza guy, but was at a party in college, late night, only a handful of us left drinking and playing games. A buddy had recently won a lot of money playing poker across the border in Canada.. spent about a grand on booze.

We’re hungry so we order pizza.

One of the ladies who was still with us was beautiful. A real stunner. When the pizza arrives, she grabs me by the hand and brings me upstairs and says “watch this”.

She answers the door for the pizza guy.. topless.

Pizza guy: *shocked silence*

Me: *apprehensive silence*

Beautiful topless girl: “so can we just have the pizza?”

Pizza guy: “sure, that’ll be $22”.

Me: *holding back incipient laughter”

Me: *fully unable to control my laughter*

We shut the door, and the girl looks to me and goes, “that usually works”.

I didn’t mind. Wanted pizza, got boobies.

I ended up hooking up with that girl that night.. actually having a threesome with her and her friend. It ended with both girls crying because the hot girl actually really liked me apparently. Wanted to look cool. Regretted it. Was mad at her friend for joining. Mad at me for being a dog. I thought she was out of my league, and then I thought she wanted to have that threesome. I couldn’t believe she actually liked me. Shit, I just wanted to look cool too. But it was too late and that was the end of our love story.

It’s okay though. I still had pizza."

It was a couples' massage, and there were separate men's and women's locker rooms for pre and post the massage. They'd let you sauna/shower/drink some champagne, and give you a nice hot compress before ushering you to the massage room.

After the massages, I go back to the locker room, shower up, and wait for my GF.. and wait.. and wait.

When she finally does come out, she says, wow that was so nice how they give you an extra little massage! I say ""fuck, they didn't offer me one"". It comes out then that not only did they give her a second massage, but the guy who did it offered her a happy ending! He would apparently move his hand around with oil and say, ""you want cream here?"" The arm, yeah no problem? The back? Sure! My glutes? okay. ""you want cream here,"" he apparently says as he moves his hand towards my gf's nether regions. No. I don't Mr strange foreign towel boy. She tells me she turned it down.

That did not trickle down. Every industry Trump said he would “save” is still suffering, or in even worse shape. All he has been doing is funneling money out of the treasuries and into the coffers of the highest bidders (and his family). Low unemployment means nothing when it’s only because half of the workers in the country need to take two jobs to make ends meet. Our healthy economy is an illusion, and if Trump is allowed to continue, it will get worse. One day the floor will drop out from under 98% of the people in this country. It’s going to get real.

Thanks for reminding me to reply to you.

I did Model UN all thru High School and it was one of the highlights of my young experience. I am almost 30 now and still look back to those times as some of the most fun and fulfilling I ever had during my mostly wholesome youth years.

Something people don’t realize—while Model UN is an incredible academic and extracurricular experience— it is also a hell of a party. All of these smart, ambitious, often good looking HS students travel out of town to a University Campus or Conference center. It’s the best field trip you’ve ever had. You are given unprecedented freedom as a young adult to take initiative during the event and to explore during and outside of it. You will get to meet and match wits with the best of your peers from around the country. You will all be dressed to the nines. You will also have fun with them. I would regularly hook up with women who I might consider out of my league at these events. I got in trouble once, but some of the women I met are friends to this day. And some very delightful memories. I also opened doors to many other future opportunities in later life.

In caucus, you will have an opportunity to debate and practice effecting real change through networking, hard work, and cunning. You only work as hard as you want to. It’s like playing a sport, but with lower expectations. Except for the prep school kids. Those kids were cutthroat.

You will laugh and joke a lot. You will get to know schoolmates from your school you may never meet otherwise. You will learn you have more in common than you think, despite your cliques. I got to explore universities like Harvard, Princeton, University of Pennsylvania.. the great cities they are in.

If you are recruiting for this, talk about these things. Talk about how exciting it is. How eye opening. What an adventure. How fun. What an opportunity to grow and challenge yourself. An opportunity for awards and rewards. An opportunity to build your resume. An opportunity to explore and redefine yourself. An opportunity to explore college campuses and talk to college students about what life after HS is like. What a youth experience it was!

I wish you great luck. Per the actual recruiting? You need to get in people’s faces. Flyering and social media won’t generate the buzz you need. Do tabling during lunch and volunteer fairs and school events. Heckle people in fun and kind ways that make them smile, and get them to talk to you about why you are excited about this. Invite them to experience it with you. Ask to get up in front of each of your classes and pitch them for 5 minutes to join the club. Tell them to talk to you to sign up. Talk casually to friends about it. And strangers. Kids in different cliques too. Hey, have you ever heard of Model UN? Then talk about it. Your passion + their curiosity and ambition is the way to build your club. Figure out what part of what I said above applies to each person you talk to, and you are in for a great time."
