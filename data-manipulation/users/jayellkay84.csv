I recently left a small, 2 woman (sisters) owned franchise of a small restaurant chain. In the words of the hands on owner, her & her sister had 4 bottles of wine and sister suggested doing something together …how about a restaurant?

I also work for one of the largest Taco Bell/Pizza Hut franchisees in the US. If you see the actual owner, he’s flying about in his private plane. 4 years and I’ve never met the man. 

You’re looking at bare minimum $500k to open a restaurant (aside from franchise licenses) and that’s if the space is already outfitted. One needs to know both the food side and the business side of things. Plus restaurants attract some very strong personalities…it’s a pretty low paying job for the shit we deal with. Staff turnover is very high. It’s a dangerous business. Open on the beach and then the red tide pulls in? You’re doomed (I’ve seen it happen a few times here in FL). Shit like that."

But one of our best customers is also Indian. He’s the owner/operator of the hotel 2 buildings over. But he knows us, and we know him. We’ve gotten used to his order, and bag it separately if he’s ordering something for his staff. We don’t make the same mistake twice with him.
