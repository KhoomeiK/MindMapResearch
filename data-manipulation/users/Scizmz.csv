Electricmotorcycles,fggjmij,t3_exyp7n,1580763240.0,Hello. California motorcyclist and ev enthusiast here. In California you need a license to operate anything more than a bicycle. There are different classes of motorcycle licenses. Class m1 allows you to ride anything with 2 or 3 wheels. M2 limits you to scooters like vespas. Originally the limiting factor was the cc size of the engine. Keep in mind that any judge is going to nail you for driving without a license if you get caught. Its best to just get the M1 as you take a 2 day class and its yours for life and can save you a huge headache down the road.

If you push a seed that has fallen from a tree into the soil with just a finger, your premise would describe you as evil. When you take this approach you're rationalizing the extreme views that are against the idea as a whole.

The issue isn't having an affect on ""the environment"" as a whole. The issue is a complete lack of stewardship over the environment while it's being exploited economically. The extraction of wealth and sustainability for short term gains while ignoring any fallout, is where we start seeing a lack of morality.

Remember, it's ok to walk away if you're frustrated or upset and let the baby cry. (provided the child is safe in a crib for example)

Read to the baby! Even now, but especially as the child's brain is developing. Take time every day to read to your baby. There are lots of organizations that will actually send you free kids books to help. Library's are AWESOME resources. There was a study done years ago that was somewhat flawed and the number has changed from 30 million to closer to 5 million, but you might look into the concept of the ""word gap"".  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word\_gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_gap) 

Explain things to your child. Don't take the ""BECAUSE I SAID SO!!!"" approach, and your child will respect you more for it.
