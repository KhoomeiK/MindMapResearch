You look like a badass determined survivor. Kudos to you!"
Advice,feh954p,t3_ep5jbh,1579111721.0,"I can offer some perspective:

I feel like a terrible person often. 

If I bump into someone by accident and apologize , my brain tells me that the person thinks I’m incredibly rude and they’re right to think so.

However, if someone bumped into me and apologized, I’d think they’re considerate and polite, and an apology isn’t even necessary. 

Encourage him to be as compassionate with himself as he is with others. 

You can point out to him, factually, all the aspects of himself that make him good. Use evidence so he doesn’t see it as compliments, but more of a solid argument against his incorrect notions of himself. 

And you could also just thank him when he does or says something nice to you. Having encouragement and acknowledgment will help him grow in how he views himself. 

Maybe even write him little encouraging notes reminding him of a nice thing he did. Or something he accomplished. Or that he makes your world brighter."

Advice,fege5wm,t3_ep16na,1579089585.0,"Computer programming/software development is very valuable to learn! If you have a pc, you can download visual studio community and practice. It’s such a useful skill if you plan to be a business owner (or programmer)."
Advice,feetyfr,t3_eoslij,1579041150.0,"Read his body language and  hug him if he looks like he needs it. Be clear that you’re there to listen if he wants to talk about it. If he does, you just need to listen. You don’t need to provide answers—there aren’t any. Just let him talk and hold his hand. 

If he doesn’t, you can still do  things to comfort him. Perhaps make his favorite food or set up an activity he likes for you to do together. If he likes standup, perhaps suggest watching a comedy special. Or play a game with him. 

My husband isn’t always vocally expressive, but I can always tell how he’s feeling by his facial expressions and posture. When his mom had cancer and I could tell he was thinking about it, so I’d go over just hold him.  I put his favorite show and he’d know that I’m here. 

And then he’d start talking. And then he’d feel a little better. And then I’d do some nsfw stuff to him and he’d feel a lot better. 

But if he wants space, give him that and he’ll come to you when he’s ready.

I remembered after I wrote this out that there are underaged people on here and I purely write from the perspective of a 28 year old married woman. My response was under the assumption that you are both 18+."
Damnthatsinteresting,fedxtqn,t1_fedpsqy,1579022167.0,I did. It only covered partial and things like imaging they did in hospital every other day  (the big stay was 6 weeks) wasn’t covered by my plan. I was too sedated to even consent to images and stuff.
