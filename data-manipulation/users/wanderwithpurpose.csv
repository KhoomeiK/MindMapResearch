TooAfraidToAsk,ffrx50p,t3_eukwcp,1580167877.0,"Well let me speak about this as someone that has done both. There are benefits to a 9-5. It could be boring yes, but it's stable and allows for you to have free time on the weekends and after work assuming you don't have a bad commute. 

For the past 6 years I've been self employed. It has given me an immense amount of freedom with my time, but also left me directionless at time and contributed to a crippling depression. It's not as stable. I'm responsible for everything. If something goes wrong I'm fucked. 

There are pros and cons to both. I've adjusted to the lifestyle but I sometimes think about giving it up just to have the stability. The worry and constant responsibly can take a huge toll."

I go in with a damn battle plan every time. Thankfully I have good doctors right now, but it doesn't stop the anxiety I have over potentially not being listened to. It doesn't help that I am actually diagnosed with anxiety, which means if I meet a doctor not familiar with me, I will feel the need to prove I'm not just imagining shit. I put off an appointment until I know its absolutely necessary and come prepared to go to war, use elevated speech and talk with confidence.

You do this for all your photos and then remove the white background when splicing everything together and integrate the decorated backgrounds. In reality this wouldn't be that hard to do.

And as I how outlined, there is a very specific reason as to why women don't do that, especially to random men. It invites unwanted male attention, which can be at minimum can be an annoyance (guy taking it as an invitation) and at worst a very dangerous thing (getting yourself a psycho new stalker). It's not worth the risk and has no benefit for us. Most men are going to have to look to their sexual partners to get those compliments."

OutOfTheLoop,ffgs5du,t1_ffgkna5,1579913672.0,"Transitioning doesn't change their lung capacity which is a huge benefit to cardiovascular sports. There was a mtf woman that had previously competed in male cycling and regularly placed near the back of the pack. As soon as she transitioned she was winning many of her competitions. And this goes with a lot of male to female trans women. Yet you hardly ever hear it in the reverse. Female to male trans men hardly ever beat out the cis men in sports and that is because that underlying biological difference is still there. Should they be treated fairly in society and as the gender that they choose Yes, should they be allowed to compete on a competitive level with cis gendered individuals, I'm not so sure."

There is nothing stopping other men from befriending lonely men and that's where the onus needs to be. Younger generations need to be brought up with better emotional skills so they can do this naturally and the current generations need to try to form better bonds with other males.

AskReddit,ffgl69t,t1_ffgkjt1,1579908778.0,"He was complaining that women weren't friendly enough to him . My comment wasn't in response to the original post. A large portion of male loneliness is because men don't have male circles not because women aren't friends with them. 

This is seen in older men too so it isn't some new trend. It's not because society condemns male social groups it's because men don't form social groups the same way women do. Be it societal expectation (working too much, not being open with their friends, etc) or because that's how men tend to naturally operate. 

Women don't care about men having all male social groups, what women complain about is men excluding women from social programs. There is a difference between men making a group of friends on their own (what women regularly do) and men starting a country club or other organization that excludes women and contributes to systemic problems."
