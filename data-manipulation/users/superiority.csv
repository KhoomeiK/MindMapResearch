There's one remaining trigger from Dovescape, the one that would have countered Eldest Reborn. Eldest Reborn is no longer on the stack.

Mana cost is a copiable quality, however, so token copies have the mana cost of the thing they're copying.

MagicArena,felzqm5,t1_felm811,1579235202.0,"I played a Brawl game last week with my [[Ral, Izzet Viceroy]] against opponent's [[Niv-Mizzet, Parun]]. My deck was entirely counters, damage spells, bounce spells, and card draw. Opponent's win-con was the standard: drop Niv, then hit the other guy for big damage, but there were a good few counterspells as well. There was also a Jace in there to prevent dying from mill, and a couple other planeswalkers like Sarkhan.

It was very tough to keep Niv off the board, because my usual method was to counter which doesn't work on him, and the first couple times he dropped I didn't have much damage in hand. So it was this very back-and-forth, highly interactive game based around countering and removing as much as possible and, for my opponent, getting in little pings of damage to me over time.

Opponent dropped Jace near the end, and I just managed to kill it, with my first attempt getting countered. Not long after, on my last turn, I'm at 7 health and the opponent has Niv on board and a Royal Scions ready to ult, which I can't do anything to despite a number of spells in hand. I bounce Niv and end the turn, ready to die. They hit Scions for the ult and immediately die from milling themself. (The damage on that ability doesn't resolve as the ability resolves, but is a trigger that happens after you draw.)

It was a lot of fun, and I had forgotten that the opponent was so low on cards. I suspect that they had forgotten it as well. Hilarious end to the game. (In hindsight, I think I had enough cards in hand to force the mill on my last turn before passing anyway, but, like I said, I had forgotten about that happening.)"

Yes, but leaving the decision to family members by default isn't some intrinsically correct way of deciding what to do with bodies. It's just something that seems reasonable to people. We're perfectly capable of making a decision about how transplantable organs should be dealt with by default in the same fashion, and it would be no more wrong to harvest them by default than to leave corpse disposal to family members by default.

Water that gets supplied through your local water system is not the same as the total fresh water resource of the country.

The bottlers are typically not just running tap water into their bottles. They extract it themselves. That's the reason that they so often don't pay local government anything for it.
