Games,ffa7vlo,t1_ff98ub3,1579729596.0,I don't think this is true. If it is I think it is just an oversight because Microsoft smarted up and is releasing their games on PC also.
Games,ffa7otp,t3_esbno0,1579729491.0,I'm not surprised. They should do a staggered PC/Console release. Us sane people shouldn't have to be punished for people who should have just gotten a PC.

I fear the Twitter backlash if this happened today, though. Imagine all the blue check marks calling him a misogynist and racist. It would be both sad, and hilarious. Worse outrages have been started over things more simple than bacon."

So far this generation seems like it might actually be worth a shit, but Corvettes have always been overpriced wedges. I'd much rather they put more effort into the Camaro rather than cancelling it over and over. Then again, what do I know. I am not a GM fanboy.

Ford has stopped making cars, but they kept the Mustang. It has never been cancelled."
