AskReddit,ffotck5,t3_eudt16,1580081514.0,"Swimming with my little sister off a beach in Pembrokeshire, West Wales, 2019. She’s only 10 and I know the currents around this beach are dodgy as. I should have been more careful. We were in our depth and in manageable waves one moment, the next we were being pummelled by huge waves with a very strong undertow. I can feel us being sucked under. This has gone from a nice swim to “oh crap, we could really die out here” in minutes. 

I encouraged my sis to swim sideways rather than towards the shore, and let the swell take us onto the rocks. The rocks were covered in barnacles and we took off a lot of skin but we’re alive. Some of the surfers who had been helping other people escape the undertow, and my dad, came to help us get safely back to shore.

I’ve got a few scars but what shook me most was how I could have killed my sister by swimming out too deep with her. I’m 27, she’s 10. Big sis is supposed to be responsible. 

I’m a strong swimmer but even if I hadn’t had my sister to hold onto, I’m not sure I’d have made it. Losing control in the water is the scariest sensation. Beware rips and undertows, guys."
AskReddit,ffolfkj,t3_eu725g,1580078905.0,"I was nine, and we lived in Cyprus. We were strolling on the seafront in Larnaca when my parents noticed people in one of the restaurants clustered around the TV. They drew closer to have a look. We then got to the car and went home, where my older sister and brother had just got home from their St Johns Ambulance club and were watching the news. I remember joining them and watching the planes hit, and even at 9 I had the distinct impression that I was watching history in the making."

AskReddit,ffi8wop,t1_ffi14e1,1579968112.0,"I always thought that was a brilliant scene. Blackadder is so bitingly satirical that a transition to a serious moment could have gone wrong easily if mishandled, but it’s a beautiful moment where the comedy fades out to underscore the deep sadness of what happened. The fade out to the poppies is like a cut to the chest. Just...wow."

AskReddit,fcz0xsf,t1_fcyzu5z,1578091463.0,"Eh, I personally think it’s extremely strange that we’re all ok with watching sex acts on film, often with friends and family around, as sex is an intensely private act. If some rando was peeping in your bedroom window it’d be voyeurism and therefore illegal. But we’re all ok just cos it’s on film?"

AskReddit,fcyy8j6,t3_ejgu7l,1578089720.0,"The fact that it’s completely normal for humans to sit in an artificially lit environment all day and talk management crap to each other, gazing out wistfully at the hills where they’d rather be, then go sit in a small metal box, drive it home at speeds which will kill/maim you and others if you collide with anything, and stare at a variety of screens before bed. 

Seriously, modern living is weird and unnatural. And ridiculously bad for us."
