But I also have a trans pride symbol tattooed on my upper arm and the chemical formula for testosterone cypionate tattooed on my bicep. If people ask about the testosterone, I usually just tell them what the substance is without detail unless they ask for clarification. But if they ask what my trans pride one is, I openly tell them. Also, if anyone asks what all tattoos I have, then I proudly explain each one.

As a side note, I have long hair that I usually wear up in a man bun and I'm 5'4"" (~163 cm) but I also have a beard. You'd be amazed how many people look me in the face and call me Miss or whatever. Sometimes I ignore it, sometimes I have fun dropping my voice super lower and answering them.

I'm sure he'll have times when he hates being autistic, I have those times too, but it helps sometimes to think of it like a superpower. I can calculate what day of the week a date is way easier than anyone else I know and I'm great at remembering the date things happened.

On the other hand, I routinely lose things to the point where I have to have a GPS tracker in my wallet and really should have more attached to other important things. So remind him that there are ways to work with his limitations, but other people can't get his superpowers so easily.

Firstly, thank you for the way you are handling your son's differences. A lot of autistics, including myself, didn't have that growing up. In my case it was mostly due to the lack of understanding of autism in the 90s, but it has made it harder for me to handle my symptoms. 

Second, I don't know where you live, but in my experience in the US, a diagnosis can really open doors for assistance that he might need later in life. And having an earlier diagnosis can be more helpful than a later one. 

Finally, thank you for sharing your story, and especially for protecting them so well."

This is a common method for people to get service dogs without the same expense and waiting period. There are plenty of service dog trainers who are well regarded in the industry who only use rescues. 

There are certain personality traits and abilities that you can look for in a rescue when you're trying to determine if they have good potential. The specially bred dogs just improve the probability of each puppy having good potential. Also, for harder jobs like guide dogs, having that greater control over the dog's likely personality is better."
