It was this girl on the cruise that I was hanging out with. She had refused to come back to the boat with me on time and ended up missing the boat. My mother and my sister insisted it was me who missed the boat and remember watching me climb the ladder.

vinyl,fepht1r,t1_fepbbbo,1579320855.0,I would go through the zeroing and setting tracking force. What you describe sounds like it is too light. I doubt it did any damage. The audio quality worse as you get toward the center is called inner groove distortion. Its a flaw of records. The goal is to minimize it. Your stylus could be worn. How many play hours would you say it has? Or you could need a cartridge alignment. These things are plenty easy to do with a little education. Watch a few turntable setup videos and you should have no problem doing the adjustments.

Homelessness is systemic and that beer they are going to have tonight isn't their problem.
