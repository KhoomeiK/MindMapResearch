For ladder, we don't even know how many heros will be in locked in for the hero pool."

dogs,ff0thec,t1_ff0ppi0,1579472117.0,"I think you're missing a word there. Are you saying most breeders, trainers, etc **don't** go to the dog parks? If so, this is the first I'm hearing about the risks."
dogs,ff03007,t1_fezysop,1579464645.0,"Ah, I understand. Thank you, because I want to spend a lot of a time at the dog park with the dog.

Hm, I guess the perspective was misleading in the photos I found. They looked like the size of my Havanese pups!"
dogs,fezx76g,t1_few7krc,1579462848.0,I'm definitely leaning more towards a standard poodle after all the responses in this thread!
dogs,fezx4iv,t1_fewa2jv,1579462817.0,"Thank you for the information. I was under the impression Australian shepherds were great with other dogs. A bichon looks a bit too small for me, but thank you."
dogs,fezwvjl,t1_fexmz3v,1579462716.0,Good to know! Thank you very much

dogs,fezwqa8,t1_fewa4it,1579462659.0,"Well, she looked very cute and you're definitely changing my mind."
dogs,fezwn5l,t1_fexxicu,1579462624.0,"Yeah, there is someone who would be willing to do that. My shifts aren't long so it wouldn't be too much to ask of them."
dogs,few821i,t1_few7s4o,1579406705.0,I've thought about a standard golden as well. A childhood friend of mine had one and I adored her. I will consider a Golden as well!
dogs,few7v9i,t1_few7e1m,1579406619.0,"I must be honest, most poodles I have met have looked a little goofy, but I'm not sure if that's just how they were groomed or if it's the breed in general."
feedthebeast,fei6yor,t3_ep7tia,1579131661.0,This is absolutely beautiful. Well done!!!
PuppySmiles,feesa21,t1_feem35j,1579040130.0,Could you share a picture?
Minecraft,fe3kol7,t1_fe3ituj,1578850184.0,"Probably cause he just enchanted it and doesn't have access to a mending villager, and probably didn't get lucky enough to get Unbreaking on his first fortune enchant?"
