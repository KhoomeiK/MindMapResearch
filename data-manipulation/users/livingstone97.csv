However, I despise my other two classes. The professors seem nice enough, but I know for a fact these classes aren't going to be nice to me, my GPA, or my mental health.

Also, my piercer has his tongue split and he mentioned losing a lot of sleep and not really being able to eat/talk or close his mouth for a couple days, so it is definitely a good idea to plan the split around your work/school schedule. Lol

college,fej74ko,t3_epchz8,1579159678.0,"Idk if this will help or not, but I am a very introverted, awkward, and relatively antisocial person, I have learned that simply talking to classmates can help you make friends. And it doesn't have to be huge and philosophical conversations, you can simply just throw an innocent and genuine compliment at them (if you like their shirt, complement their shirt), or ask them about the class, or ask if they want to potentially get a study group together some time, etc. 

Joining clubs is also very beneficial, it practically forces you to get out of your comfort zone and go out and interact with your fellow club members. I can almost guarantee that there is at least one club on campus that you would find interesting. And if there aren't? Find the one that sounds the least boring and give it a go. 

Either way, I wish you the best of luck, my friend! Live your best life, and if you enjoy being solitary? That's okay, too. But college can be a very stressful and isolating point in your life, and sometimes having people who aren't family to talk to and hang out with can help to make your life a bit better"

AmItheAsshole,fe9pjt2,t3_eo33vy,1578940342.0,"NTA. There are microwave dishes made specifically to sterilize menstrual cups, and it is honestly kinda gross to use something someone is going to eat/drink from or use to make food/drinks to sterilize a feminine hygiene product. 

Not only that, but she can use a microwave safe mug or bowl to sterilize her cup, and then put that mug/bowl aside as her cup sterilizing mug/bowl. 

She can also boil water and pour it into a container with her cup in it. There are options that do not involve contaminating a household item that people use to make food/drinks. 

Here's a link to an example of a cup sterilizer, but I am sure that there are better quality ones you can find:

Either way, I agree with you. OP was not in the wrong for taking her pill, nor was she in the wrong for saying what she took.

AmItheAsshole,fe516d0,t1_fe3rngc,1578864693.0,"Lol, there's a small risk of you getting pregnant from unsafe anal sex. 

Not because of ass babies (have had people try to explain to me that there aren't reproductive organs in the ass, this is something I know), but because of the fact that semen can leak out of the anus and come into contact with the vaginal opening. Semen + contact with vagina = potential pregnancy."

AmItheAsshole,fe4x5nb,t1_fe403m3,1578863624.0,"I mean, the pill is usually small enough to dry swallow *for me*. But that isn't the point. There is absolutely no reason OP should have had to interrupt her dinner conversation just to take her pill. 

I do agree with what you're saying, btw, he likely wouldn't have cared if it was tylenol, or anxiety/depression medication, or anything like that. The issue wasn't her taking medication at the table, nor was it her telling him what the medication was, because it likely wouldn't have mattered with other medications. The issue was the fact that the friend's bf has some gross stigma when it comes to birth control.

Edit: added to my comment"
AmItheAsshole,fe4uo47,t1_fe49okz,1578862957.0,"Why should she reset the alarm a couple hours and put herself at risk? The ability of birth control to be as effective as possible is directly dependent upon the person having a proper schedule. They need to take the pill around the same time every single day. It isn't worth being late even once if you can avoid being late. 

There was nothing inappropriate about her taking her pill. She didn't need to be discreet about it, and it wasnt like she was making a big deal about by waving the pill pack around and making sure everyone knew she was taking meds, she popped a pill out of the pack, placed it in her mouth, and swallowed it. As someone who used to be on the pill, taking the pill is not super noticeable. He should have never asked her about her medication, it literally was none of his business. And her answering honestly was in no way inappropriate."
AmItheAsshole,fe4rdf2,t1_fe4dfcb,1578862070.0,"Her answering him honestly was in no way impolite nor inappropriate. 

Saying ""yeah, I just took my bc pill"" after being asked ""did you just take something?"" Is in no way an impolite or inappropriate response. It also isn't her talking about health issues. It isn't any different than replying ""yeah, I just took some ibuprofen."" It doesn't seem weird to me to answer ""yeah, I just took *insert medication here*"" when asked about the medication you just took. 

What made this conversation inappropriate was the dude who got offended over someone taking a medication that didn't concern him, and then starting a scene about it.

ETA: I had a person who sat next to me in one of my classes last semester. They took their bc pill at noon every single day. A little silent alarm would go off on their phone, they would pull their pill pack out of their bag, and they would take their daily pill. At no point did I question it or care, because their health and medication not only is absolutely none of my business, but also, birth control is nothing to be ashamed of, and I would rather them feel comfortable taking their pill on time regardless of who may see, than them ending up pregnant because they missed pills/were frequently late due to the fact that they couldn't take their pill on time. 
Also, there is absolutely no reason why they should have to interrupt their class work or, in OPs case, their meal/social time just to go to a private location to take a pill."
AmItheAsshole,fdy8hat,t1_fdx7vfg,1578777167.0,"Exactly, like, was he supposed to just stay down there and wait for her to get out of the shower? No matter how long it took? 

I sometimes take a bath before a shower and can be in the tub for an hour or so before washing off in the shower. Or sometimes my showers can last longer than 45 minutes (not common, but if I have had a rough day, if I am tired, or if I don't feel well, sometimes I just lose track and just stand under the running water zoning out). 

I can't imagine expecting him to be late to work, putting his employment at risk, and being trapped for who knows how long. I get being pissed at him for breaking down the door, it sucks. But I understand why he did it, and I would feel terrible if I accidentally trapped my SO in the basement."

The hilarious thing is that it pisses us off when someone else does it, but we all still accidentally do it (and then defend our actions to the pissed off individual?) I don't even now why we keep it locked, though, since the garage remains shut when we aren't moving the car in/out."

AmItheAsshole,fds6oh6,t1_fds5bem,1578695567.0,"OP got an abortion, so there will never be a baby. 

And, again, I understand OP getting offended over him thinking she would cheat. People do cheat, sure, but the ex is asking for a paternity test because he is insanely ignorant, not because he has any real reason to suspect cheating. Even if she cheated, she would still be on birth control. So, with his ignorant logic, she shouldn't even be able to get pregnant by the side dude. 

It was only on his mind because he is ignorant on the topic of birth control and somehow things that the condom and birth control made it impossible for him to knock her up but did not make it impossible for another guy to knock her up. 

Personally, I would also break up with my bf if he accused me of cheating just because I got pregnant despite protection. Idgaf if it ""makes me look suspicious"" I don't want to be with a guy who thinks that little of me and doesn't trust me. If you're going to accuse me of cheating, we don't need to be together, fullstop."

We would tell someone to leave a partner who isn't allowing them to get a job because that is abusive and controlling. It prevents the other person from leaving the relationship. 

Strip clubs are completely unnecessary for someone's well being, and if their partner doesn't want them to go, they need to respect their partner and not go. If they can't handle not going to the strip club? They need to spend time single and find a partner who is chill with their partner going out to the strip club. End of story."

Taking a break from school is not quitting/stopping school. I have friends who had to take time off due to poor physical health, but they got back up on their feet and started going back to school, and they were even more successful than they would have been if they tried pushing themselves to go to school when their health simply wouldn't allow it. 

There is no shame in taking time off if that's what your health and grades require. You just need to do what is best for you and your health. Please don't let others make you feel guilty for taking care of yourself and mourning in your own way."

Either way, I am so incredibly sorry for your loss. Please talk to a professional if you can, and please surround yourself with loved ones during this time. If you decide to go to school, talk to your advisor and the mental health people at your school, and also tell your professors about what is going on. Take care of yourself.

AmItheAsshole,fdrufph,t1_fdrt1vn,1578689907.0,"I don't think it is, though. 

Asking her for a paternity test implies that he thinks so little of her, doesn't  trust her, and thinks she's a big enough piece of shit to go out and cheat on him. It implies that he thinks she could be an irresponsible slut. It is especially bad since he knows how she feels about sex. It took a lot of trust for her to allow him to have sex with her and take her virginity. He knows that sex is a very intimate thing to her. 

I personally would be insulted if my partner asked for a paternity test if I ended up getting pregnant. If he doesn't trust me, we shouldn't be together. He knows how I feel about cheating, he knows how disgusted I am over people who cheat, and he knows I would leave him if I wanted someone else. 


Now, under certain circumstances I would understand asking for a paternity test. There have been plenty of times where I told a guy to ask for a paternity test because he had suspicions she was cheating, or they split up for a period of time and she ended up pregnant, or he caught her cheating, etc. I even messaged an old buddy of mine, who was paying a hefty amount of child support, after finding out his ex got pregnant around the time she fucked another friend of mine. 

But, in a relationship where there was trust and everything was okay leading up to the pregnancy, suddenly asking for a paternity would be very insulting to the pregnant person. 

If a guy needs a paternity test to be comfortable, I get it. But he needs to realize the implications that come along with demanding a paternity test, and thus the potential consequence of her not wanting to stay with someone who seemingly doesn't trust her enough to stay faithful."

If he was uncomfortable with her not wanting him to go to the strip club, he shouldn't be in a relationship with her in the first place. I'm sure this isn't the first time this came up. The strip club discussion probably occured way before their engagement and marriage, at least before the bachelor party. If going to the strip club is that important to him, he shouldn't have stayed in the relationship and instead found a woman who was chill with him going. 

Obviously he actually respects his wife and relationship, and he cares more about his wife and relationship than he does about going to the strip club. 

Also, not everyone enjoys strip clubs, and him not going to the club doesn't automatically ruin his night or prevent him from having fun. He can have fun with his friends before and after the club. It isn't a difficult concept that men can have fun together without going to strip clubs, picking up women, ogling at women, etc. 

If your partner isn't comfortable with something (within reason) you should respect them enough to not do it. For many, stuff like going to the strip club is a very huge dealbreaker and wouldn't be okay under any circumstance."

I was away from my bf of only 8 months because I chose to go to a school hours away.

Despite all the vulnerability, the loneliness, the stress, the separation from my partner, etc, I still chose not to cheat on him. And that was after being with him for only 8 months. There is absolutely no excuse for what OP's wife did. All of it is bullshit that she is trying to use to emotionally manipulate OP into staying with her cheating ass. She fucked another guy simply because she wanted to fuck another guy. No excuses change this fact, and I hope OP leaves her cheating ass.

ETA: I even had a nice guy hit on me once and ask for my number. My response was ""hey, thanks, but I actually have a boyfriend."" We told each other to have a nice day and then went our separate ways, and then I instantly told my bf about the interaction.

My point is, her age is not an excuse. Stop making excuses for cheaters and telling their partner that they ""should have expected it."" If she wanted to whore around so badly, she should have done the decent thing to either call OP, or on one of the many visits he made to her, tell OP that the relationship was over because she was going to go out and fuck other guys whether he liked it or not.

Maybe she didn't talk to him first because she didn't want him to accidentally guilt her into staying pregnant or staying with him.
