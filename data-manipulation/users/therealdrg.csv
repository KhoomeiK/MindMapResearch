AskReddit,ffcdxdz,t1_ffby4av,1579797376.0,"I dont agree, I think the problem is that a lot of people feel like they will enjoy doing something, but really dont. Or dont understand all of the things involved when doing it professionally versus as a hobby. I work in IT, and I absolutely love working with computers. I still do it as a hobby and I do it professionally. Nearly every single aspect of it provides some kind of satisfaction for me (except working with end users, and training people, both of which can easily be avoided). Nothing could kill my enjoyment, and work is a breeze because its fun.

I also love working on motorcycles in my free time, and I would never, ever do that for a living because the difference in expectations isnt something that would be fun for me. I enjoy it personally because I can take my time, do the right thing, find my own budget, and build what I want. But if I was forced to rebuild an engine in a few hours, or change tires, make compromises for someone else budget and whatever else? I would absolutely hate it and it would grind me down insanely quick. Even helping a friend work on their bike is not fun, its too close to work."

It was 3 checks, $59,000, $27,000, and $13,000. He wanted to deposit the first 2, and cash the last one. So a total of $99,000 dollars into an account that had a balance of $0.52 and get a new debit card because his current one ""didnt work"". That is pretty strange behavior, especially because for transactions of that size you'd generally just have the other party transfer the money rather than walk around with a bunch of checks, and because a transfer is relatively instant and non-refundable so you dont have to worry about the money ""bouncing"" out of your account or being on hold. Either he is naive and doesnt realise he did things in the most suspicious way possible, or he did realise this and it was intentionally done to make the transaction look suspicious. I'd probably go with the later because I'm cynical and because that money was coming from a lawsuit and he's already got another lawsuit ready to go."

interestingasfuck,ffae4h7,t1_ffa8zax,1579733464.0,"Those are bad assumptions though. A fish thrashing might simply be a reaction to a threat that has worked in the past. A bigger fish biting it? Thrashing might be enough to break free. Stuck on a log? Thrashing might shift it enough to get out. Beached? Thrashing might eventually get you back to some water. Fish who thrash when in trouble may simply live long enough to breed more on average.

There is no such thing as an ""evolutionary reason"". Evolution is not purposeful. Certain traits might be evolutionarily advantageous or disadvantageous, but simply saying ""A situation exists"" is not justification for a trait having to exist. There are plenty of reasons why a fish feeling pain would be evolutionarily disadvantageous. That is also not proof that the trait doesnt exist.

Physiologically, a fish just doesnt have the necessary brain structure for interpreting sensations that a more complex creature has. Fish probably feel *something* when things happen to them, but assume its pain in the same physical sense that we interpret it is the same as saying because your dog looks at the tv, he understands what a tv is, how it functions, and how to use it. Youre taking evidence (the fish reacts to something we would find painful) and extrapolating it beyond what it actually tells you (The fish reacts to something we would find painful, and since this sensation is painful to us, the fish must also be feeling the same sensation)."

Games,ff3ptot,t1_ff3gip8,1579546256.0,"Its ""open world"" in the sense of theres a lot of open space between you and your next fight. Its not open world in the sense that theres anything to do there besides pick up some glowing orbs. 

The gameplay loop is basically:

1) Run or fly to the next marker

2) Talk to some characters, maybe pick up some glowing orbs on the ground

3) Fight

4) ""Level up"", put some modifiers on your character

4) Repeat

Maybe this expands out more later but I doubt it. There are a few minigames here and there, but most of the game, as expected, revolves around fighting. 

The one good thing I will say is that the game plays a lot like Budokai Tenkaichi 3, which is probably the best dragonball game ever made. If only they had the same roster of characters to back up the gameplay, it would have probably been a great game. Instead, its just similar but in a less fulfilling way. Maybe the next game will be better.

If you arent a huge dragonball fan, I would say this game is worth about 20-30 dollars. If you are a huge dragonball fan, its still not worth 60 dollars but you'll buy it anyway. If you dont like dragonball at all, this isnt the game that will change your mind, its just objectively not that good. Its not terrible, but the shine of a not-terrible dragonball game wont cover up the flaws for you."
technology,ff3cfhy,t1_ff32uoz,1579538389.0,"For the same reason hillary wasnt torn apart for the hundreds of good reasons to do so.... because hes ""their guy"" and he will get the nomination no matter what. 

After the last 2 DNC nomination circuses, how can anyone still believe the DNC actually cares about fielding a candidate that their electorate wants? The DNC will, as always, nominate whoever is aligned with their interests and whoever can be directed in the way that benefits the core of the party. None of that aligns with anyone who would want to nominate bernie or warren, and none of it aligns with the majority of democrats unless youre living in a nice, gated community making hundreds of thousands a year.

The real sad part is the only movement to change this is putting forward candidates so radically unelectable and polarizing that theres no hope they can succeed in their goals of reshaping the party. 

Before anyone tries to chime in with ""Yeah but....!"", I'll cut you off. The RNC is no different, and the fact they were subverted for one cycle is most likely going to end up meaningless in the long term."

Looking at the discussion this spawned, I feel like theres a correlation between being financially illiterate and hating tax breaks."
videos,ff34kvh,t1_ff330er,1579533521.0,"Theres so many problems in this comment. Your tax return is not based on how much you make, its based on how much you pay. You started a new job. Are they doing withholding properly now? If your company calculates it correctly, your tax return will be minimal because you dont overpay the entire year. If they calculate it incorrectly, then you pay much more than necessary in taxes and get much more back. 

Are you earning the money different? If you put in a lot of overtime or work long shifts with long breaks (2 weeks on, 2 weeks off), most companies will take withholdings incorrectly, calculating the percentage that you'd owe for a week with heavy overtime or long hours as if that was your normal salary. Double your paycheck 1 week out of the year, and that paychecks withholdings will generally be far, far higher. You get the majority of that back at refund time, which can make your refund a lot higher if it starts to make up a majority of your earnings. 

Youre using tools and personal equipment for your job, are you writing off those expenses and the depreciation? You should. This would increase your refund.

Youre looking at this from the completely wrong angle. Your refund is meaningless and a small refund is a good thing. You dont want to give the government a bunch of money to hold on to, just to make sure you get a lot of money at tax time. You need to compare how much you paid in taxes previously, and how much you pay now. Any other number is irrelevant."

I'm guessing you think ""statist"" is a conservative keyword? Literally the descriptor for what the current democratic candidates represent, and have represented for pretty much this entire century so far, and a great descriptor of why I dont support them anymore. I could have said ""communist"" or ""socialist"" but I dont think any of those ones are legitimate contenders for any real power.

Being liberal doesnt mean you have to support getting rid of guns. At one point liberal meant that you valued personal liberties, now it means youre a statist. That shift in mindset is why I personally dont consider myself ""liberal"" anymore and dont align with the viewpoint of many current ""liberals""."
