As for me disagreeing with the Cannes jury who also went out of their way to reward Polanski that night, they rely on polemic to be relevant. Now did she say anything in particular to champion the movie? Because I can find nothing so it is odd you select her as a juror as the avatar of Joker credibility."
movies,ffg2h6j,t1_ffg1l1u,1579897028.0,"I'm mostly speaking for myself, but also it is important to say that the movie is aggressively mediocre. It turns a terrorist into the most sympathetic anti-hero possible by having him fight show tune singing wallstreet bros. It completely lacks the courage of it's convictions and the softball it throws barely makes it over the plate. Every choice it makes is a softer version of what Scorsese did 30 years prior.

Joker is as though there never was a comic, only Scorsese. The setting, the time, the place (NY as Gotham), the mom, the standup plot, making him a populist hero (happens in both taxi and king)... it is all Scorsese, no comics. As a comics nerd and a movie nerd it is just baffling, I feel like I'm watching people eat tide pods and throw a few at people who 'are too dumb to eat them'.

Maybe you can theme your runes as 'attendants' or 'monks' or something and give them the ability to sometimes have a fate that would befall a temple fall on them.

It is a drafting mobster game set in the 1960's where each turn you take a card, play a card and pass your hand. People try to build small criminal enterprises by playing thugs, properties and events. 

The game has a ton of synergy and pretty much everyone I've introduced it to got hooked. With a few it never clicked but mostly people got super into it and sometimes even won their first game. It is a nice mix of randomness but also strategy allowing for some insane plays if you pay attention and get cards that work together.

This means you can use 1 core to play with 2 players, and each player has a kinda prescribed deck with 'every card available to them' across two classes.

This is why people say 'buy two cores' in case you really do want a second wither or beat cop or any other popular card. At the same time you could print copies of only the player cards and not end up with 'twice the stuff' as Fantasy Flight wants to you. Multiple cores allow more players but also the ability to customize your deck like remove this card and add 2 of this card instead. 

BUT then Dunwich comes around and it has 2 great scenarios, 2 copies of multiple new player cards and 5 new investigators who can splash cards of other types. So I would say 'buy this' before you buy a second core, but a lot of the community would disagree with me. 

Then Dunwich is the first couple of stories in a whole 'tv season' that is released 1 story at a time for about $13 on average depending where you buy them. Each of these packs has a new place, a new adventure and 2 copies of several new player cards... so the 'core' is the only time you would ever have to double up. 

Now if you wanted ALL of Arkham that is pretty expensive like probably in the $300 range but if you buy like a 'season' or cycle every time you get bored of the current one it is kinda a good deal... I'm 2 years in and 2 cycles in (Dunwich and Carcossa)."

Dunwich core box has 2 FANTASTIC scenarios and then every other one is good but it will give you a good card base and all the staples.

My advice is watch some videos so you pick up good habits and figure out action windows and proper upkeep.

Then when you play with newbies run the tutorial and you sit back and act as ""dungeon master"" instead of playing so you can keep track of everything and help them have a good experience rather than harass them.

Hardcore push that losing is not the end and no game is this forgiving in terms of multiple options and branches and resolutions. Failing to ""save the princess"" (to be generic) is part of this playthroughs story and not a failure.
