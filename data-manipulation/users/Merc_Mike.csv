The Grappling Gloves is a lucky roll in the Vault. You just have to keep going till you unlock them. Same as I think a joker jetpack that gives you flight and a pair of flash boots that, when you wear them gives you super speed.

Even asked people if it smells good or bad cause I was looking for something new every one of them said I smelled great. One of my female coworkers even said ""for a dude your size you have great hygiene"".

Blame Old Spice for bringing me over to Axe. I broke out using their stuff. Axe's Dark Temptation is the shit. Deodorant/Spray and the body wash.

The scents are not bad. It's when people use anything TOO MUCH.its over bearing.

As a teen, I used to be big on Polo (Blue was my fav). It smelled good, but I'd dose my self in it often.

That shit has one of the best scents ever, but because of my use it was terrible. I had one friend straight up tell me never wear it again. 

That same friend years later loves the Dark Temptation (its smells like chocolate/caramel) I use.

I'm trying Doves Sport stuff atm, stick wise, just because Axe is no longer doing Dark Temptation at least from where I shop. Dove smells like old people. :/"

I've even used source material. You have not.

Ghost pokemon arent gas.

Everything wrong with dogfighting is wrong with pokemon. Pocket Monsters either groen or caught in the wild being forced to fight other monsters for riches and ""glory"". Doesn't matter the outcome.

Lavender town is prime example. And that's the video game lore that is canon. Pokemon do get fatally hurt or die. UNLESS the trainer does something about it. Other pokemon eat other pokemon. It's in the pokedex descriptions. Look up Shuppet and Bannette. Non gas ghost pokemon. Bannette is a pokemon who was tossed out and unwanted.

Dogfighting can end with no death but the pos owner will put the losing dog down because of the loss instead of nursing it back to health.

Now they are adding pokemon who used to be human. Adding to my point: not every pokemon wants to battle. Cause not every human wants to battle. Take Proffessor Oak. Hed rather study them than fight them. So...its by force.

Let me go catch some Yamasks and force them against charizards in an Arena for prize money. Its forcing animals (pocket monsters) to fight other animals.

Everything you saying not a thing of matters. The bottom line is:

YOU TAKE A WILD ANIMAL FROM ITS HABITAT, AND THEN FORCE IT TO FIGHT OTHER ANIMALS (nobody is going to understand a Pidgey's motive or if it wants to fight something).

Charmanders die if their flame goes out. I'm sure every single charmander made it out alive fighting a water gym. /s

there is literally Ghost Pokemon. You have no idea if, how, and when ALL those pokemon died. They only show you one side of Pokemon at a time cause it's a cockfighting game disguised as a kids game. Lol

Detective Pikachu has illegal underground fights as well. And knowing Humans, I doubt every pokemon of them made it out ok.

Most of them arent willing participants in fights. I'm pretty sure most pokemon caught from the wild never hear of a Gym battle or understand the concept. They are just out there surviving.

Its Cock Fighting but Japanese Anime themed.

Playing Red originally has no background of any intelligence or at all lore written about ""they know what they are getting into"". Its catch a wild animal in a pokeball and force it to fight for you for money and Prestige to beat the Elite  Four.
