It's one reason the Miracle on Ice was so huge- because the Russians had their pros, and our team was a bunch of college kids and non-nhl types.  That's mostly changed now, and why you see things like LeBron playing on th US men's basketball team."

CompetitiveWoW,fe2lpzu,t3_ekw1bb,1578840103.0,"IMO, equipping a BoE is a huge waste of resources for any progression guild.  Gear is easily upgraded. If you're raiding mythic and mythic boe boots drop, chances are there will be some other pair you could get within a week or two that would be just as good.
If that boe TFs with socket, that might not be true- but the gold youd get from selling it would be FAR more beneficial to the raid as feasts/cauldrons than 1 dps with some fancy boots.  Leave BOEs for the people with more gold than sense."

Someone posted actual data above that refuted your points where you said 'agree to disagree' but that probably won't change your mind either.  Keep giving 10% of your earnings thinking it will do some good.  It wont.
