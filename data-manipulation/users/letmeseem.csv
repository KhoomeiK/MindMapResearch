Here's the ELI5 and almost correct version of why the price is negative: We don't have infrastructure to store large amounts of energy since the production in normal situations can be regulated by the dams.   

The problem is that when the dams are nearing full and there's no end of rain in sight, and the only way to get rid of the water without risking an accident is to run it through the power plant, you risk an overload of the grid.   

So in order to not destroying the grid you need to give an incentive to increased use. That incentive is usually lower prices, and really only has an effect on energy hungry industry.   

What happens now is that they really REALLY need to get rid of some water so they have increased the incentive to actually pay people and companies to use more for a while. For a normal person it doesn't really matter since using more only amounts to a few cents extra a day, but for power intense industry this really makes a difference since electric can be a significant portion of the cost. This is a huge incentive to increase production."

Ironically it wasn't illegally selling weapons that was the boiling point either, but funneling the profits to fund The Contra in Nicaragua that congress had stopped funding after they were classified as a terrorist organization. 

So to sum up: illegally arming Iran (that  was under a weapons embargo) explicitly to fund a terrorist organization, probably acting on the direct orders from president Reagan (although there's a theoretical chance the military did it mostly themselves with some help in the administration, but that's somehow even more frightening). 

The five administration officials convicted plus one that had yet to go to trial were pardoned at the end of the presidential term of GHW Bush. He was vice president at the time of the scandal.  

On the note of Bush: Even if his own diary from the time included that he was one of the few people who fully knew the details, he coasted through the next election by insisting he was out of the loop and refused to comment. And won.  

So who convinced Bush it was a good idea to let them go, you ask? He surely wouldn't take that risk without some legal counsel?
