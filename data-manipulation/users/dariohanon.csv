therewasanattempt,felzsom,t1_felunbc,1579235251.0,"The biggest problem imo is: whites aren't always the issue. That's why I talked about ""minorities"" and ""majorities"" every country has different proportions of races. That law in Japan that forced every kid to have black hair for them to enter school is a good example of blatant racism.

Also no, I didn't mean to say (and I'm pretty sure I didn't say that) that kids can ONLY trust people who look like them, it's just easier. If you were a kid, wouldn't you trust a grown up that looked like your parents? You call it racism, I call it common sense; doesn't matter if it comes from blacks, mongoloids, Scandinavian, slav, germanic, Latin American, Middle Eastern, aryan, Semitic, etc. Simply because you've always been surrounded by the same race, you know you can trust them, here comes someone that looks like them, you (subconsciously) know you can trust them.

I guess my point wasn't on you own race, but the people you already trust, an adopted Indian by a black family would theoretically have more trust towards black people. 

A world without some type of segregation is just a utopia. Mexico for instance, doesn't suffer from racism, but it does suffer from elitism (a lot).

In a perfect world, people would apply for the job that suits them the best, and only the best would be chosen regardless of race and gender, but we don't live in a perfect world."

therewasanattempt,felk67l,t3_eps0ej,1579224131.0,"Title is misleading at best, but it does need to change.

A scared child (or anyone for that matter) will find it easier to follow instruction from someone they think can trust, which can potentially save lives.

Also, if we  force minorities into majority-jobs now, a black, Latin, Asian or whatever, can decide to become a firefighter on its own because he/she saw a ""familiar face"" when he/she was a kid. Kind of how ""black people can't swim"", if they were to try swimming they would be overwhelmingly surrounded by non-black, which can be awkward to them and never try it again."
