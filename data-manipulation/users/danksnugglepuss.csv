EatCheapAndHealthy,ffp5b3c,t3_euei4j,1580086564.0,"TBH a toddler should be able to eat pretty much anything you eat, with minor modifications as needed (e.g. some foods might need to be grated or chopped up, especially cut up slippery foods like grapes or hot dogs, and avoid anything super small/crunchy like popcorn, nuts, seeds, etc.)

I don't have any recipes because I think feeding a family is busy enough without having to make separate recipes/foods just for one person. ;) I would consider the following plain foods as easy finger foods:

* cut up chicken
* cubed or grated cheese
* cubed melon, grated apple, sliced pears or peaches, bananas
* lightly steamed veggies like broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, peas (and some kids might even be able to do raw veggies)
* strips of whole wheat bread or tortilla
* cooked pasta
* boiled egg

If you're looking for recipes specifically, fritters might be a good search term (e.g. zucchini potato fritters) or if you used infant cereal and still have some left, you can find pancake and biscuit recipes that include the cereal (although making regular pancakes/biscuits/muffins/etc. is much cheaper - just won't be as high in iron)

Have fun with feeding!"

AskReddit,ffi749v,t1_ffhp1yw,1579966835.0,"> Like, 99% of what I see about HAES is entirely second hand from people vaguely bad-mouthing it like they haven't looked into it themselves.

So much this. The ""official"" movement describes itself *""working to promote size-acceptance, to end weight discrimination, and to lesson the cultural obsession with weight loss and thinness. The HAES approach promotes balanced eating, life-enhancing physical activity, and respect for the diversity of body shapes and sizes.""* 

Literally my experience with HAES is a) meeting practitioners who quietly work with a focus on health behaviours - nutrition, movement, sleep, stress, and beyond - rather than the numbers on the scale; and b) people on the internet trash-talking the movement. I've not really seen HAES or other body-positive messaging that suggests ""everyone is healthy all the time no matter what"" ""overweight is preferable"" ""promoting an unhealthy lifestyle"" or any other such ideas that people seem to believe are being promoted. Perhaps it's out there, but I don't think it's as common as Reddit likes to believe. Maybe in many cases, weight bias is twisting the movement into something it's not."
regina,ffcrf80,t1_ffch3zy,1579805711.0,"> Lakewood's staff are really really nice, and I've liked the vets I've seen there, but be aware they promote holistic health, and some of the treatments they've strongly encouraged are really really expensive. 

This. I've heard good things about this place, and the location would have been super convenient for us, but we ended going elsewhere because all the wacky alternative health stuff on their website really turned me off.

We take our cats to Albert North and our experiences there have always been wonderful."
weddingplanning,ff83opp,t3_es524g,1579665146.0,"Yes, they design bouquets with only ""in season"" flowers which is how they keep costs so low. You don't have control over the flowers, but you can choose between white / pastel / bright colour palettes. You could try and look back at any of their social media photos posted in the same month your wedding will be, and you might be able to get an idea of what will be in season at that time. 

I don't have any experience, but I'm actually trying to decide between this company vs fake flowers, myself! It's not nuts for me because most of our other decor is green/neutral-ish, so I don't need to be too choosy about particular colors - I think any flowers would look good. If you have a certain theme/colour scheme or want more control, then this company probably wouldn't be for you."
Weddingsunder10k,ff79mkh,t3_ervvzl,1579643961.0,"These are both lovely! In the first picture I thought the shiny ones popped more; I agree with your comment that the glittery/textured ones get a little lost under the lace (especially when you compare them side by side - that said, I think the glittery ones still look great in the photo where it's just those shoes under the dress). 

Can I ask where you got both of them?!"
TwoXChromosomes,ff44zxc,t3_erfxq8,1579555667.0,"I agree with your point that it's mostly social conditioning - it's just seen as ""normal"" for women to take on this role. I can't really speak for men but perhaps it's also possible that some men think about marriage, but don't want to bring it up due to the pressure it might put on a relationship. Perhaps they are serious about the relationship but not yet ready to propose, and they feel that if they talk about marriage, the woman might start to begin *expecting* a proposal soon (again - social conditioning), which could potentially build resentment or disappointment if it doesn't happen as soon as she expects. I think it's important to talk about marriage, but I guess what it comes down to is good communication and managing expectations, as with most things in relationships!


I'll also digress to add that these social pressures are super annoying for women on the other end of the spectrum, too. I was with my SO for 10 years before we got engaged; I can't remember who brought it up first, but we talked at length about marriage and relationships many times - and I was always clear that marriage was not that important to me. We *could* get married, but we didn't *need* to. It always bothered me that people would tease SO right in front of me about ""putting a ring on it"", and then after we got engaged, they would joke about how it ""finally"" happened, I must be so patient for ""waiting"" that long, etc. It's like people assumed I must have been moping around for a decade just waiting for my life with him to begin, even though we had already been building that life for years? To me, all of these jokes and comments essentially implied that there was something wrong with my SO, which was not the case at all. What the heck, society!"
RingFitAdventure,ff25pqb,t3_er49s5,1579494541.0,"No shoes, on yoga mat. I already do most of my other exercise without shoes and otherwise spend a lot of time barefoot, so it's just what feels natural and I haven't experienced any soreness in my feet, knees, or ankles.

nutrition,ff24sxe,t1_ff1sr88,1579493817.0,"There is definitely [some evidence](https://www.almonds.com/blog/nutrition-wellness/skinny-almond-calories) to back this up!

This research was done for almonds specifically, but it wouldn't be a stretch to assume that it applies to most *whole* plant foods. (Notably, the calories from almond butter were still absorbed ""as expected"" - so certain types of food processing may blunt this effect)"
TwoXChromosomes,fezpdmf,t1_fez9xt2,1579459989.0,"The bonus assumption here is that losing weight is the only reason people go to the gym...

I was just using that as an example to illustrate how ridiculous that dude's question was. I'm lucky to live in a ""normal"" body, and I know all about energy balance (but I eat intuitively now due to a history of being too obsessive).


What I was trying to get at is that people use size to make a lot of assumptions about health and personality (lazy, unmotivated, etc.), and unless you're that person's doctor, asking for their weight is not a helpful or necessary way to make judgements about that person's health (or character). And even doctors don't - or shouldn't - use that number in isolation.

Individuals are welcome to date or not date whomever they please, but in the end, what is all about appearance is justified under the guise of health (when we know that this [bias](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/weight-stigma) directly harms people rather than helps them). So maybe instead of straight up asking someone whether they're fat - with the implication that they'll likely be judged harshly if they give the wrong answer - people could have a little more tact?

Other rhetorical questions: What is even meant by ""chubby""? What if someone's BMI was 24.5, are they chubby or thin? Why do people think it's appropriate or useful to ask someone how thin they perceive themselves when body dysmorphia and unrealistic expectations are so prevalent?"

TwoXChromosomes,fewsfy7,t1_fewphr4,1579418800.0,"That's [not the prevailing view](https://obesitycanada.ca/understanding-obesity/) of most major medical and health organizations, but ok.

There's a difference between having preferences and moralizing about health. If your preferences include certain appearances, fine. But you can find out if you're not a good match for someone without needing to whip out a calculator to determine their BMI

ETA: thanks for the downvotes, but here's the direct quotes from my link that contradict how someone can ""know"" fat = not taking care of yourself 

*""Many organizations including Obesity Canada, the Canadian Medical Association, the American Medical Association, and the World Health Organization consider obesity to be a chronic disease...*

**Obesity is more than just what you eat and how much you move.** *Many people believe that the amount of fat in your body is only determined by what you eat and how much you exercise. But the reality is that obesity is a complex illness caused by a number of different factors, including your environment, genes, emotional health, lack of sleep, medical problems or even some medications you may be on. Even with the same diet or the same amount of exercise, people will vary widely in the amount of body fat or weight at which their bodies settle.""*

And like, this is extending way past what OP even posted about - she was asked if she was ""a bit chubby"", whatever the fuck that even means - you could be a tad overweight or even a ""normal"" weight, appear a bit chubby to some people, and still be perfectly healthy. These questions about weight on dating apps are about appearance and control at their core, not about health.

TwoXChromosomes,fesatug,t3_eqc671,1579363364.0,"Gross. Glad you dodged a bullet.

There are lots of responses here like ""people are allowed to have preferences"", but seriously, this guy's questions were rife with assumptions and stereotypes. Like assuming:

* that knowing someone's weight is even useful with no other context, especially when you're also trying to link it to their [fitness level](https://www.blogilates.com/wp-content/webp-express/webp-images/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-20-at-6.16.20-PM.png.webp)

* that whether or not someone ""considers"" themselves skinny is an accurate measure of how thin they are (e.g. I wouldn't consider myself skinny but some people tell me I am - now what?)

* that going to the gym says something about thinness (e.g. I'm chubby but I've been going to the gym for 2 years - now what?)

* that someone's current body will remain that way forever (will he drop you like a hot potato if you gain 10 pounds? At least now you know you don't have to waste your time.)

It's just a rude question, period. If you're not physically attracted to someone, fine. But if you're coming out the gate asking directly ""hey, u chubby?"", don't be surprised when people respond negatively."
