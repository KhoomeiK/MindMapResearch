TrueOffMyChest,fffuk9m,t3_etbeux,1579892113.0,"It’s not the same thing but I have a close friend who grew up in totally different financial circumstances to me & we sometimes forward each other articles about things to do with mental attitudes towards money just to compare how it was for us. It’s just really interesting to us to see the other side of things because there’s always going to be a certain kind of ignorance about something that you weren’t taught about & haven’t experienced. So, basically don’t be mad at her for not realising/understanding -  there are probably be things about her situation that you don’t know either because it’s never been a part of your life before. 

I know you just want to vent so forgive me for offering just a little bit of advice - I’ve been in a very similar situation & it did cause an issue in the relationship. The issue was though that sometimes we just wouldn’t see each other because he had no money. If he had been open with me about it there were loads of times when I would have chosen differently (e.g. maybe 2 much cheaper dates so I can see him twice this week rather than a dinner out & not seeing him for a week or more afterwards) or, more importantly, I would have just gone to see him. I would have rather driven over to his place & watched Netflix than have not seen him at all because he couldn’t afford the bus to meet me somewhere. I’m sure your girlfriend feels the same way - you are what she wants out of this relationship, not the dinners out that she’s probably had thousands of in her life. Don’t push her away - if her feelings aren’t genuine then the advantage of your situation is it will become really clear really quickly, but give her a chance to show you how she feels."

offmychest,ff61tfh,t1_ff56rdm,1579616972.0,There’s a type of therapy called DBT which has a lot of focus on reducing self-harm behaviours. There’s a Reddit sub for it (of course) with loads of resources - r/DBT - and it’s easy to find PDFs of workbooks online for free. Obviously not quite the same as getting therapy but they are the kinds of things you can work through on your own & might help you continue on this great track - I’m really impressed with how well you’re doing & how hard you’re trying!

If you’re hiding something then you have some sense of shame about it. The funny thing is that I have had this conversation about someone. I don’t want to disclose the whole thing because it’s just too personal for me but basically I was telling my friends about a situation & someone involved was embarrassed that I was talking to my friends.

It’s not meant for everyone, but I guess the theory is that if you were a good parent your kids will still be involved in your life because they *want* to be, not because they *have* to be."

AmItheAsshole,femedbf,t3_epmdeh,1579251133.0,"NTA - your stepdaughter & honestly your husband sound like people you would be better leaving than giving anything to. I’m so sorry for your loss, I can’t even imagine what that must feel like, so here’s my two cents which obviously you can take or leave as you think best. Firstly, this is still very recent & you haven’t been receiving the emotional support that would have been ideal, so I’d say that you should probably hold off on making any serious decisions for a while yet. Definitely don’t think for a second that any of that money needs to go to your husband or his daughter, but you also don’t need to rush into donating it anywhere else. Secondly, I really like the idea of donating it & think that’s a very thoughtful gesture but I just wanted to suggest one thing that I haven’t seen anyone else here say yet: you can also just keep it for yourself. You’re still young (we’re actually the exact same age so I have to say that!) & who knows what life will throw at you. That money could provide you with the same kind of ‘cushion’ that your stepdaughter was hoping for, especially if your current marriage doesn’t last. There are other ways of honouring your daughter (a tattoo, a star named after her) but maybe even taking a year to go travelling would be something she would have liked to see you do. Obviously all your call but just thought that might be another idea & you should feel absolutely no guilt about whatever decision you make. Sorry again for your loss."
AmItheButtface,feg8o5o,t3_eos6yb,1579082347.0,"NTB AT ALL. I would hurt someone who woke me up from a deep sleep, never mind sex or whatever else. But what struck me was that he values his own sleep & routine so much more than yours. If you woke him up at 6am a few times a week, how would he react to that? He’s not willing to go to sleep early & wake up early, so it would effectively be the same as waking you up in the middle of the night & I’m guessing he wouldn’t appreciate it. As you’re bending over backwards & he’s not willing to make a single concession I’d be putting the focus on trying to work on the relationship issues outside of sex first (& I’d also wake him up at 6am to make a point, but that’s just me.)"

This year is a perfect example - the first serious fires started in winter. If someone had tried back-burning at that time they would just have triggered the same out-of-control fire."

sydney,fcmwqu4,t1_fclwd1b,1577795728.0,"Ok, so that’s a genuine fact & definitely a precedent (which changed a lot of things about how bushfires are managed & has helped to have a lot fewer deaths ever since). But there are other facts which makes these fires unprecedented - they started in winter, they have been burning continuously for longer than ever before, & they are bigger than ever. For example, there are currently 3.6 million hectares on fire right now. The Black Friday bushfires were “only” 2 million hectares. 
Also 11 people have already died, including a firefighter in a truck that was picked up & flipped upside down by the fire, & we’ve got months left to go."

There would be fires, of course, but there would be a few, spaced out, rather than the near-constant 3 months of fires we’ve had this year. That’s how policy decisions have made things significantly worse, because preventative actions that could have been taken weren’t. Then of course there are the more direct policy decisions, like not investing in the equipment firefighters need, ranging from face masks up to more helicopters.  Basically nothing has been done right & it’s made an already rough situation a hell of a lot worse."

On a weirder but funnier note, my weirdo cat is slightly obsessed with water & I’m here having a bath & I overfilled the tub a bit so when I moved it overflowed a bit & got the mat that he was lying on wet. First he got interested but then I guess something needed to be done so he actually took a corner in his mouth & walked backwards, dragging the mat out of the room. He came back after a couple of minutes so I guess he left it somewhere that was more satisfactory?
