Sumo,ffp4h50,t1_fff2fhz,1580086012.0,"If he can only use one technique, sure. But it doesn't seem that way. It looks like he uses a variety of techniques that are appropriate to the direction his opponent is pushing or pulling. Plus the rikishis needs to match or exceed his technique execution speed. He seems to have extraordinary reflexes. Even if you knew a technique is comming but can't react fast enough, foresight is no use. Combined with sudden changes in throw direction when the opponent read the throw, it's really hard to practically apply. 

The most effective ones I've seen used against him are those that keep their distance. Enho needs that connection with the center of balance to win. Enho suddenly is at loss when they keep their mawashi away and just slaps. He has to rely on speed and timing to bridge the gap and go for a mawashi grab. Similar to a jab and sudden dash with body strikes in boxing."
Sumo,ffoxbhf,t1_fffyfnd,1580082956.0,"Yeah. Except he is open to techniques that requires stepping back. Aside from being aware of his body, he's also fine tuned to feeling the other rikishis' direction of force when they are locked together. Great technical skills all the way."
Sumo,ffowmjx,t3_etf5b8,1580082639.0,"What I like about Enho is his quick changes on technique based on the situation. Most dominant sumo wrestlers would rely on power to force a technique--especially throws. Enho flows with the opponents' direction then adds in the techniques to gain the upper hand.

You are also not guaranteed a win when you root for Enho. Sometimes before the match, I would get nervous knowing he's down in points and could be lacking confidence. But oh boy, when he gets that win, you sure clap and cheer even when he couldn't hear you. The possibility of loss makes his wins even more exciting to watch."
