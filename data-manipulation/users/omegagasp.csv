I believe that every person should seek out a professional to talk to regardless if there's been something traumatic happening or not, it can be truly insightful. And talking to someone who's unrelated to anything going on in your private life can offer different perspectives on matters as well. So yea i think it's a good idea that you talked to a therapist, do something good for yourself so you can stop to doubt yourself :)"
offmychest,feaivbo,t1_fe94s15,1578949398.0,"Thank you so much friend. Sometimes it's hard to listen when the mind is so clouded, and even harder to break the habits and be kind to yourself. Keep swimming is probably one of the truest advices ever tho. I hope your year is gonna turn around into something real positive. It might be a struggle at first but you'll get there :)"
offmychest,feaia56,t1_fe99s4b,1578949112.0,"I have the same problem, it's a hard concept to grasp and I also have a ton of work ahead of me to change my own habits and negative thoughts. The subconscious is the worst enemy in all of this. But I'm positive we'll get there, don't give up!"

offmychest,fe8p2ws,t1_fe8deic,1578928788.0,"Right? I've seen mine for only a few months, but even tho it's such a short amount of time she's made such a huge difference, picking me apart and putting me back together over and over, and each time life gets a little easier. Our therapists are amazing people :)"

No need to feel like an idiot - tho I really get it to feel that way and to overthink on it. When it happens to me I just try my best to laugh about myself and be happy that I made other people smile for a moment, given that they indeed did laugh, haha. No one is perfect and no one gets hurt, so no need to worry."
