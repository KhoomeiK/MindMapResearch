Here's hoping this will help give kids the *unbiased* tools needed in getting them the correct information *before* making a judgement, whether right or wrong, agree or disagree with their opinions of the information itself. 

 Problem with us adults now is that we are getting farther and farther away from caring about the information itself and only focus on the parts that prove our biased beliefs are right or the other side is wrong, that we don't care about what's actually right or wrong anymore, we're fighting each other over which side of the same coin is right when the whole coin itself might not have any of our best interests at heart"
