Well to be honest, the ladies are all reasonably attractive.
It would be nice to see less body augmentation as that is unhealthy trend for the masses who are influenced by the Kardashians. Most men enjoy some chunk-in-the-trunk(naturally occuring though) and the way Kim's butt is glorified is a scary trend. Surgery like this should be frowned upon and not considered attractive."

politics,ff6o8kh,t3_erv08q,1579631409.0,So neutral non-USA here.  When do democrats decide their candidate ?  Also as Trump  is going for 2nd term who would Republicans want as the opponent in Nov 2020 to ensure re-election? I ask because Hilary was the favourite but lost. Surely Biden or Bernie would be an underdog to the incumbent Trump? Wouldn't they?
