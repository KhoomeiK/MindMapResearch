bipolar,fga2mqr,t1_fg9vd8o,1580646056.0,"This is something new to me. I’m definitely in a depressive phase but also feeling symptoms of mania (not needing to sleep, spending way more, eating less, risky behaviours, drinking more etc.). Then to top it all off I’m simply losing my shit at absolutely nothing and lashing out for no reason. This really isn’t a good place for me to be in."
bipolar,fga0o4o,t1_fg9xpms,1580645378.0,"With all due respect, this isn’t really helpful. It is known that the character in the play is Bipolar. These recent episodes are very new to me and I’m finding it difficult to understand them. My anger or shouting isn’t exactly directed at my SO, it’s just anger in general. I’m not an angry person but when my mood swings and all I can see/feel is rage it’s very difficult to deal with. I’m awaiting a medication review but with the NHS being as stretched as it is, outpatients at my local mental health hospital are having to wait weeks to see a psychiatrist."
bipolar,fg9wypn,t1_fg9wda3,1580644102.0,I don’t know. I’m not doing it on purpose. I worship the ground she walks on. She’s the only one who keeps me sane. That’s why I’m here asking this question.

shrooms,fg901q0,t1_fg6nnzf,1580632443.0,Nice! It should start spreading much quicker now. [Here’s what my pots look like now](https://imgur.com/a/PRDWc7A) . Are you going to use the humidity tent from Cyclocybe or put them in something like a shotgun chamber?
shrooms,fg609tz,t1_ffxm9d4,1580546953.0,Condensation was how my growth started too. How’s it doing now two days later?

shrooms,ffxe5il,t1_ffwc1we,1580323307.0,Sunday 19th Jan. Have been trying to get the house around the 19-22 Celsius mark. I have three pots in total. All three are now showing signs growth.
shrooms,fez64jq,t3_eqkjd1,1579454170.0,They look like they’re from Wholecelium? I’ve kept truffles from Wholecelium for up to two months in the fridge and they were just as amazing as they were when I first received them.
