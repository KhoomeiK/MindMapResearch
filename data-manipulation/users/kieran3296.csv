joinsquad,fef3ap8,t1_fedagdx,1579047171.0,"I really want them to implement something like a simple black screen after a dead-dead hit rather than just opening the spawn screen, might set a more cold tone than their is currently.

The immersion of this game is what drew me to it, and seeing things go from panic to silent black for a couple seconds would really drive home how quick you can be dropped without warning."

KotakuInAction,fe8nhbi,t1_fe5eksy,1578928277.0,"Its just godawful - the pilot for series 12 features so many eye rolling pathetic amateur level things its just so surprising anyone thought it was ok.

The antagonist is basically “google” - the main characters interview the owner and ask him why cyberbullying is bad - the main reveal of the threat is done by having the same guy go on TV and thank everyone for giving him their passwords, CC details, mothers maiden names etc. Its as subtle as a brick to the face.

Then the very climax of the plot, where the doctor defeats the enemy is done by having the doctor share a voice recording of something the antagonist said, followed by her saying “thats the problem with modern technology, you never know whos listening”

Like come on. This kind of topic can be handled so well and with so much nuance, and yet they chose to just make it “modern tech bad” - it has a serious case of tell dont show, the audience is never left to think about things, theyre just told through a spout of exposition and then its left. 

Awful writing, pretty awful acting, awful plots - just nothing to hook me like old who."

ocsp.apple.com

Connect to “adguard DNS”

Tap the top left lines to open settings

Go to “blacklist & whitelists” 

Select the blacklist file to be the text document above

Enable “connect on demand” 

Click the play button in the top left of the main screen to connect

Boom, you dont need to worry about apps getting revoked anymore - sorry if this is a bad guide, i didnt come up with this method by myself and it took a lot of experimentation

Painting it like they’re a group of sensitive no-lives is surely just dismissing valid criticism? 

I dont necessarily agree with the downvotes in this use case, and i’m not even saying there arent PCMR people who just irrationally hate everything - i’m saying your comment paints many well-meaning people in a bad light"

FracturedSpace,fdlhylb,t3_elxgmx,1578524416.0,"Unless you own the bootleg launcher you cannot play online at all.

If you havent already i suggest you join the KS3 discord to interact with the remaining community - i myself am running a steam group with the aim of having WEEKLY games - more info on that can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/FracturedSpace/comments/edskiw/fractured_space_games_are_back/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

The steam group contains a link to the KS3 discord, a guide on installing the bootleg launcher AND a guide on how to fix it, as there is currently a bug. 

Hopefully thats all the info you needed to get you into things - and if i left anything out, the Steam group and KS3 discord will 100% cover it

Also note: the Steam version didnt JUST become available again, this is a misconception i keep seeing - The recent Steam update simply made it so that free to play games arent removed from your library when uninstalled - the game has been and will continue to be available to download if you owned it at any point prior."

I’m not defending pewdiepie lmao, i’m just saying that this isnt going to make your point well heard or understood, its insulting and divisive - if you wanna talk to me about pewdiepie then pm me, i dont come on this sub to hear it, but if it makes you feel better i’ll listen. 

This isnt me trying to make this an argument, just state that you arent helping anyone here - you havent enlightened anyone, only insulted - every reply you make is a snide quote from me stating how pewdiepie is evil when i’m not trying to tell you he isnt evil. 

I’m trying to convince you that you should turn your insults into more constructive replies past “subscribe to pewdiepie”, or simply to discuss this on somewhere like r/changemyview where you can have a healthy debate about it and perhaps convince others in a healthy way. 

TLDR: you could do better, and thats all im trying to make you see - sure you can think pewdiepie harbours an alt-right racist fanbase, but that doesnt make it ok to you yourself lash out to prove a point."
ShouldIbuythisgame,fcfkvsp,t1_fccysa7,1577631084.0,"Im sorry - i only just saw this since you didnt reply to my comment directly. 

This isnt about specs or games, simply the fact that OP asked whether the Oculus was worth it, and your contribution was to spend over double the money for 1 single game - you couldnt even name the headset, just “the steam one with alyx” - which makes you seem pretty uninformed on the topic. 

What if OP doesnt have a PC? What good is a Valve Index then? You tell them to spend double the cash and they cant even use it? Again, its like you didnt read the question OP asked.

The reason i didnt reply to OP was because unlike you, if i dont know the answer to something, i dont try and give a shitty uninformed answer - i can happily criticise those who DO give shitty uninformed answers like yourself though.
