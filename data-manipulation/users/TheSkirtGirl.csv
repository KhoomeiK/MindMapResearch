gatekeeping,ffsqxa7,t1_ffsq58n,1580189323.0,"I mean sure, but that's not part of the definition of a flavored latte. I'm sure some places have more natural flavor substances. Mocha is just a latte with a different flavor than other flavored lattes. It's more popular a drink, hence it's own name, but it's not always made differently. I did work at a place that melted its chocolate but I've also worked at a place where they made their own syrup."
gatekeeping,ffsq0a3,t1_ffspsm7,1580188461.0,"Okay, but what lattes with added flavors like vanilla or caramel? You refer to them as vanilla latte, or caramel latte. It's just that when you add chocolate syrup to a latte it gets a different name. A latte is a type of steamed milk espresso drink, flavors notwithstanding."
gatekeeping,ffsk8e2,t1_ffren63,1580183757.0,"Yeah. A mocha is a kind of latte, and is made with steamed milk. So coffee and chocolate as a flavor is ""mocha"" but the drink with the same name is a steamed milk drink with espresso, i.e. A latte."
EDH,ffsict1,t3_euxlri,1580182420.0,"I'm not understanding something. So you used Putrefy on Meren and put it in the yard right? Wouldn't that have let you bring back Mindslaver without having to go thru the combat process?

And then you said they didn't have any creatures when you cast Gnaw, but didn't you send Meren to the graveyard?"
