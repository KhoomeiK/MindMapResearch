The full release into a 1200 square km re-introduction zone of the park happened Summer 2018. They're having babies and generally adjusting very well, so that's awesome."

But it's still a choice that comes with trade-offs, if you've got 2 kids nobody's forcing you to live in Maple Ridge and commute to Vancouver, when Burnaby and New West are an hour closer. Tons of families raise their kids in apartments and one floor houses too, hell I've got two friends who each have 3 kids and live in the city. They've made that choice to sacrifice more living space and lower rent so that they can bike to work and spend more time with family."

Bike lanes **are** a good way to address urban transportation with a densifying population. I live near downtown and love that I have my car / Evo / Car2Go / bus / bike / walk as options to get around. The people that complain the loudest are the ones that choose to live far from where they work and ""are forced"" to drive in. Fuck those entitled shitheads and bring in road pricing."
