Advice,fc7sfoa,t3_eggedl,1577517461.0,"This may be presumptuous of me, and I apologize if so, but it kind of seems like you already know what you want to do. In which case, I say do it. Those are not the actions of a mother who is looking out for her child's best interests. And I know how tough it can be; I'm still working out my own decision regarding my toxic dad, so trust me, I know. It's hard to cut out such an important part of your life. But if you're anything like me, then the main things keeping her in your life right now are societal obligation and a hope that things will get better, rather than love or respect or any reason that SHOULD foster a healthy parent-child relationship. And realistically, things will not get better until she realizes that she's the one damaging the relationship. So if you still really want to hold out that hope, tell her. Write her a letter. Explain to her why you're cutting her off, and under which (if any) circumstances she'd be allowed back into your life. Then she'll either do the work or she won't, but at least then you know that you've done everything you could to salvage the relationship.

It's important to keep in mind that none of this is your fault. Her toxicity is on her, not you. The toxicity of your relationship is on her, not you. And cutting off contact with her does not make you a bad son. It makes you someone who recognized that you were being mistreated by someone whose job it is very specifically  not to do that, and took steps to protect yourself from it. It's hard. It sucks. It's upsetting. But for the sake of your mental well-being, you do what is best for you. I don't know how much you need to hear this, but it bears the reminder. Good luck."
