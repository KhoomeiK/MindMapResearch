AskGaybrosOver30,fdrfe6c,t1_fdr3irr,1578683710.0,"You can still have low T and be horny. Even at my lowest I would still Jack at leads once a day. Also, I noticed a couple of comments lower I noticed 3-4 years ago was your last level check. It changes between the time you wake up and go to sleep, or depending on what foods you eat, or physical activity, stress, and as you near your mid 30's, it has a high probability of dipping naturally. It could very well be the issue.  Even if you know the shit on Social media is unattainable, it doesn't mean you can't drag yourself into a depression pit comparing yourself to others. Especially since you have already been in a depression before, it increases the likelyhood of having it now, and injuries can also exacerbate this.

Also, you are 30. Even at 60,70,80 it's not too late. I hate that we did the same thing as women and put an expiration date on ourselves. You are still barely an adult at 30 to be honest, especially based on life experiences as that is truly what shapes your maturity. And of course some people think their life is over at 40.No. Still young. Honestly, I am loving 30. I don't care about half the superficial stupid shit I used to, and it is liberating as hell. There is also a great deal of truth in the ""learn to love yourself."" So many guys make getting with someone a goal in life, and that is generally awful for whoever that guy ends up being. When you choose to make other guys the sole thing that makes you happy, you put the responsibility for your happiness on them. I've been there, and that is an extremely heavy burden to bare. As that person, you end up sacrificing your own happiness for theirs, you end up being trapped in codependency which is never a good thing.

Bottom line. You are still just a mere pup and have plenty of time to love others, but don't forget to date yourself, and  Every person needs to accept that they are not invulnerable to mental or physical issues. They happen, and it's absolutely nothing to be ashamed of.

depression,fdqlzc8,t1_fdqg9sy,1578669844.0,"ADHD plus Bipolar here. Not easy, but I suppose no ones life is really. I opted out of meds because they feel like your soul disappears. I remain emotionally aware at all times which is super exausting, but sometimes I slip. I still maintain a career in IT, but are some pretty bad managers out there that can do some pretty bad things.

Last job I had, my manager sent me between manic episodes 4 times in 4 months. Straight up abusive, and not just to me but everyone else there. And I'm not talking fun hypo-mania, like oh this is a great day everything is awesome. But bad mania. I was a full blown psycho. I can't even describe ..... It doesn't feel like you are you, but you have this unrealistic amount of self confidence, but really quick to anger. I got home and my husband and I got into a fight as he had been drinking and can push my buttons when he does (legit he can be an asshole when he is drunk) and normally I would try to join to tolerate, initiate some fun time to get his mind off it, maybe even just go to bed if there is no winning. This time though.....I backed him into a corner in the closet and started screaming say him, about everything that I disliked about him whether they were true or not, and I had violent urges. Instead of taking them out on himz I obliterated the closet door, so now no it's kinda a half door..... Even though I didn't physically hurt him, it still crossed my mind, and I'm not sure I can forgive myself for the fear in his eyes.

ADHD though, I view as a super power if used correctly. Sure I can't get organized for shit, and I can't do super boring things, but I can hyper-focus like you wouldn't believe. And even juggle a few tasks simultaneously. I would even argue that is how I work best. I just hate the awkwardness, losing what I was saying half way through a sentence, not thinking before I talk.

In fact as you get older, you tend to care less about certain things, and eventually won't even notice the difference. I usually say that if some dude is staring you down, it's usually caus they want some, even if they are the odd random homophobe, because even those are usually closeted (figure out first, they can double down and get mean). 

Luckily you live in a day where being gay isn't a big deal anymore. You can join a community if you feel, but you don't need your gay card validated, so you can also meet friends in different places, from coffee shops to online communities.

You can only get so much advice on marriages And relationships as one is never the same as another. You do what works best for you. Honestly, all either are two people (or more, whatever you are into) who enjoy eachothers company so much that you can't get enough, though everyone needs some alone time. You can adopt, maybe have a female friend who offers to surrogate, or be there for your nieces, nephews, and friends kids, because every kid and parent needs all the help they can get.
