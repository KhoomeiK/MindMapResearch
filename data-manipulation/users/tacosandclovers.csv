I have come up with the hypothesis that it's not really exhaustion but fear of starting a new thing or really move caused by the actions of my narc step mother. Stepping out and trying something new was always punished so I learned to not do anything new or different. That's why I consciously force myself to do something new or different than the usual when I'm feeling exhausted. It doesn't have to be the thing I need to do, just something. Sometimes it's just going to the store to buy myself a treat I never allow myself usually, sometimes it's shaving my head or painting my toes."
