 that's their whole thing. unfortunate they use emotional topics, lies and misinformation to get non-wealthy and uneducated people on their side to worship them.
 It's the same everywhere unless the populace knows history and how it happens again and again and again until a revolution happens and the process begins again. 

The US was special as its supreme leader gave up dictatorship power to form a decentralized republic. However as money is concentrated once again through evil trickle down theory, the only safeguard against the wealthy is weakened and maybe destroyed. 

The government, which creates and maintains the law, is the only thing preventing a lawless neofeudalism of the wealthy. The non wealthy will bow to the corrupt ""law"" which only serves to protect the wealthy in that case. This is the republican plan of ""starving the beast"" as Newt Gingrich put it.
