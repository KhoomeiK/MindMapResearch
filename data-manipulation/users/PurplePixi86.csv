Oh my God I am so glad I am not the only one who has had this thought. I dont actually want to be hurt but I have a 2 year old and an EBF 3 month old. The thought of having a night or two sleeping alone in a bed, with no obligations and meals brought to me would be so bloody nice.

Kids are ""innocent"" so it's shocking if they swear. Plus swearing properly is an art form (especially here in the UK, we have SO many levels of swearing), kids never get it right."

She lived in the East End during the Blitz, raised 4 kids on a working class pay, lost my grandad over 20 years ago and has lost most of her physical health. She totally deserves a bit of naughty fun and enjoyment in what little life she has left :)"
