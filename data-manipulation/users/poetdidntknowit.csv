AdviceAnimals,ffhhs00,t1_ffgvr0a,1579935822.0,"You just brought back an old memory. I was a typical teenager who left all the dishes for my parents to wash. My sweet Dad asked me to do the dishes just once. He came in the next morning to find all the dishes stacked up and touching the ceiling. I told him that his request to ""do the dishes"" wasn't clear and left it up to interpretation. I wish I had a time machine to go back and slap my smartass younger self."

buildapc,ffhd4zf,t1_ffgv1m4,1579930497.0,"I'm with you. My PC is on the floor. What's important to me is that my PC is powerful and quiet, but I don't care about the case itself as long as it just isn't ugly. I want all focus on the screen and what is happening on it."
Austin,ffg0nvz,t1_fffzbap,1579895910.0,"Just looked it up, no penalty in Texas for refusing SFST. License suspension is only for refusing breathalyzer and blood tests."

Austin,fffzq92,t1_fffhqoz,1579895336.0,We've got cameras everywhere including on tolls and you're surprised by this?
Austin,fffyvmm,t1_fffqo5u,1579894810.0,"Seems like someone who is stone-cold sober would avoid a hassle and legal consequences by just taking the tests.

Edit: I mistakenly thought you could have your license suspected for refusing, but that's not true for SFST. You can get your license suspended for refusing a breathalyzer or blood test."
Austin,ffepzn8,t1_ffdg30t,1579859682.0,"Lack of empathy. Fucking sucks but that is ingrained in a HUGE number of the population. My own sister: ""Lock up all criminals. Oh wait, now I'm in trouble. Society is so cruel and MY situation is different!!! Fuck lazy people on welfare. Oh wait, I could use help now and MY situation is different."" I call her out and it's nothing but excuses."
Austin,ffeoo24,t1_ffehbju,1579857680.0,One of my best memories was visiting a friend in DC and neither he nor his friends owned a car. Didn't need it. Walking and subways got me anywhere I wanted. We walked a ton and had a great time wherever we went.

Austin,ffefkwc,t1_ffdx0am,1579846115.0,Good call keeping the article title. Maybe we should standardize on something like [sic] to acknowledge that the title is both accurate and stupid.
Austin,ffef9of,t3_et5167,1579845788.0,I'm imagining a dystopian future where I35 is just a cluster fuck of scooters because that is the fastest way to get anywhere. Gonna be like vids I've seen of India traffic.
Austin,ffeev4x,t1_ffdvp8z,1579845371.0,"Thought about that. Actually, it sounds like maintenance is so shit that I wouldn't be shocked if the alarm fails to even work. I don't know much about this but I've seen elevator certification docs posted in elevators so I'd imagine it's heavily governed, and that a vagrant occupant would be addressed in those codes somewhere."

Austin,ffdopvz,t3_esy9e4,1579825384.0,"If nobody does anything, I'd be very tempted to just hit the elevator fire alarm and plant a seed that the bum did it. I don't condone misuse of emergency services so I wouldn't do it, but I would be super tempted."

coolguides,ffbzo8z,t1_ffbgk1o,1579787740.0,"This gets me wondering about the possibility of rounds that expand asymmetrically, like maximum expansion but only on one side. I wonder if that would induce more tumbling and possibly do more damage. I'm guessing that would be hard to get through a barrel cleanly, among other potential challenges."
