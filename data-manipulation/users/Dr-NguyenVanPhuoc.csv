this has been disproven a bunch of times. sometimes harsh punishments even encourage crimes. if you get death for rape, why not murder your victim? same punishment but your chances of escaping are much better. lots of historic examples for this. but i guess history is also just a bunch of fiction.

&#x200B;

\>  And speaking from a strictly number side of things, only about 1.6% of people on death row that are innocent get executed

this number is impossible to confirm. it's unlikely that there will be further investigations after an execution, thus we can not know how many innocent people were murdered.
