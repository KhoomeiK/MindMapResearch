In PvP I run NMA, BoS, and Valkyn. It works fairly well, but with food buff my HP is well over 20k (28k in Cyrodiil) so I’m actually thinking of ditching Valkyn for Grothdaar or Zaan. This is all on my Magplar.

For PvE I wear NMA, MS, and Grothdaar for overland and False Gods, MS, and Grothdaar for Dungeons and trials (will switch for Zaan for single target focused trial fights). You really notice the damage from Grothdaar, and the extra magicka is welcome.

You don’t really need the HP from Valkyn in PvE with food buffs and other buffs in group. You are better off with more damage. I never have any trouble surviving. Overland content gets slaughtered to the point where I can’t think of a world boss I have tried to solo and couldn’t manage it right now."
politics,ffyc77g,t1_fftroq1,1580342950.0,"You wouldn’t be living luxuriously on just $1 million.

If you want to live off invested income without depleting the principal investment the rule of thumb is you need to live off no more than 4% of the original investment amount per year (IIRC).  That would be $50,000.

However, over time that $50,000 would get you less and less, so in reality you’d want to live in less than 40% so that original investment can grow.

This is why I don’t think $1 million is actually enough to stop working for anybody who isn’t already approaching retirement unless they are willing to eventually live in relative poverty, most likely.

But 1% of $1 billion is actually $10 million, so you could live very well on that your whole life and grow it so you are richer when you die than when you started, all with relatively minimal effort and no actual work."

In PvE it’s better to go with a monster set that will provide more DPS, but the meteor from Skoria does an AoE splash, hits relatively hard, seems to have no range limit, and can’t be LoS.

I’ve gotten a kill from Valkyn Skoria in PvP where the enemy ran behind a wall at least 150 feet away and a DoT tick procced the Valkyn meteor and finished him off. I couldn’t even see the guy, I just saw the meteor animation and got the notification I’d killed him.
