I have emerging rage/ anger issues now. So its not a false statement.

Maybe its saying something about feelings or things going on with you.

Also i have gone to sleep with my lamp on only to wake up and its off. Its not a touch lamp it has a switch so yeah. But i know i will sometimes wake up and turn it off. I figure i dont remember is all."

Dreams,ff9ztai,t3_esegmv,1579725006.0,"When i was younger  i would dream of ruined cities and thousands of zombies moving down the streets like rivers . i would be living on roof tops and scavenging what i could from top floor apartments. But i was terrified.

I would dream of being chased by them but they would never catch me.

As i got older my dreams changed. And i started saving other people from them and killing them. Now i was still scared but i wasnt helpless.

I remember climbing this weird concrete tower that had window slits like the old forts had where they could just aim the barrels of their guns out. And i climbed to the top while zombies inside clawed at me from inside windows....i saved a dog and somehow got down and escaped in a stationwagon lol

I had a funny one once where i actually got caught by them..and when they came at me i was suddenly wrapped in bacon..i fell down and they ate it off me then left and i was like...wtf lol

The last one was very graphic and messed up. I was so scared when i woke up my heart was beating so hard. There was zombies outside but i was trapped inside a building . And it was one of those dreams where you are just and observer..like i was forced to watch someone be flayed alive , they wasnt a zombie just some stranger..the screams were horrible. I was so messed up when i was able to wake up.

Sorry for long post but i have had zombie dreams my whole life."

socialanxiety,fdu52wz,t3_emvoyh,1578727689.0,"Bar rules are just common courtesy , dont start a bar fight , dont be rude etc. 

You go and sit at the bar and the bartender will come over and ask what you would like. Now if  you dont know what you want, you can do what i did and ask the bartender for advice. I was like ""well I want something mixed , not straight. And sweet and I dont like wine or beer"" the bartender thought for a moment and was like ""you ever try a Buttery Nipple?"" And no she wasnt coming on to me. And Im like..nah. And she made me one and its now one of the things I order regularly. That and White Russians. 

Im a lightweight at drinking and I only do shots at home so more cocktail stuff is what i like when out and about.

Nobody was staring at me for sitting alone either. Lots of ppl go to bars alone. You can take aslong as you want drinking your drink and the bartender will check on your from time to time to see if you need anything.

As for what to do a lot of bars have tvs. I saw people bring their laptops or books etc. The bar I went to you could also order food from local joints and have it delivered to you  there.

Bars also will have a event calendar. Well mine does  , and shows what days and times they do fun stuff. Like Karaoke or a band etc. I went to Karaoke a couple times , I was terrified lol. But you dont have to join. And there was some really good singers at my bar , i was surprised."

As far as her pushing you away / stopping you from touching her, thats strange if she was touching you. And I would find it concerning myself. I would have felt the same as you  , that i was maybe being played. but its hard to say since i wasnt there. Them watching you is also creepy and weird. But I know I feel like im being watched in public when I get nervous , so unsure if thats what you were feeling or they were literally staring at you waiting for something to happen.

And about the feeling you did something wrong. From what you said it doesnt seem you did. When I had a crush on a girl a long time ago and i would attempt to flirt ""not very good at it"" and would get no response, I would then feel guilty like i had done something wrong. But I hadnt , its just I was so worried about messing up or offending her that I felt that way when in fact everything was fine and she wasnt offended.

And what sucks is the guild I found is amazing. There is always atleast 15 ppl on , guild runs , Mythics , pvp. Gear runs for new players or alts  , you name it. All great players , so nice and no Drama...like a dream guild and I cant even get into it. Im honestly disappointed."

I hate I felt like i gave away to much info and have put myself in a weak position. By weak position I mean in a place where it could backfire in the near future and hurt me. Like me in the past confiding in someone for them to ghost me , or throw it back in my face and treat me poorly. 

Im struggling with this myself. As it just seems to happen and i dont notice it till its to late. Which sounds odd but in the moment I dont realize im giving to much info or talking to much. I also wonder if its my poor self esteem thinking im oversharing etc , or if Iam actually talking to much.

Only thing you can try is to be mindful during the conversation. Such as keep descriptions short and to the point. Give someone else a chance to talk etc. pay attention to what they say. Let there be breaks where you dont talk except when someone is directly talking to you of course or you just agree / disagree to something said . 

  And before going into such a social situation prep before hand. Like remind yourself to slow down , take a moment think about how you have felt after previous socializations and what you wanna improve.. And after think of what you felt did well and what didnt or was to much.  Thats what I try to do but Im still working on it."

I mean we have contact regularly but its very casual..like a video game coming out etc.  i have had to accept this since trying to communicate with him on personal things gets me nowhere. He will share some if he has a girlfriend or with his 2 friends but not with me. For reasons unknown since when we were younger we were very close.

As far as anxiety his is worse. He is 5 years younger than me and has had issues attaining / keeping jobs etc due to his anxiety. But he wont seek help. Or talk about it. He has however always had someone to stay with.  

Me on the other hand i worked most of my 20s even with my panic attacks at work. Severe depression and anxiety were the main theme of my 20s.

 Im mid thirties now. I did goto therapy for awhile until they lost funding and closed down. But really it didnt help me much. Tried anti depressants and anxietymeds. Made me a zombie , felt nothing at all. And thats worse than hurting in my opinion. I no longer take meds. 

Working did help me by forcing me to be around people etc. Was hard but i feel after its all said and done that really did help me. I dont have panic attacks anymore. But find when im very stressed i will have one in my sleep and it will wake me up.

What im saying is , in a constructive , non self harming way use that anger and put yourself out there even more. And by that i mean go try new things you havent tried before. Horse back riding , para sailing , go join a d&d group...idk try all sorts of stuff. And make some NEW friends. Cause if your friends are not making time for you but making excuses instead you need to make some new ones.

 Im sorry your going through this but people make time when its important to them. I learned that from past ""friendship"" experiences.

I dont care if i have friends anymore but i can see the importance of socialization.  But i give major props to you for putting in the work you have already. You got this and your going to make it and achieve your goals. Look what you have accomplished so far.

On the anger as fuel thing i do that and make myself go to the gym. If im so upset about being fat then i tell myself ..then do somethin about it! Lol"
