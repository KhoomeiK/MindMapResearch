space,feg94eg,t3_eolw8l,1579082991.0,One of my best friends actually is the optical engineer at LIGO and is responsible for the laser. Goodness I love seeing them get headlines!
dogpictures,fdrqwzs,t1_fdrq030,1578688278.0,Just a chain of bells I hang on the door itself. There’s a ton of videos showing how to train in YouTube. He’s the first one bell trained and I won’t ever go back. Every dog I have going forward will be bell trained!
dogpictures,fdrqpo8,t1_fdrov7l,1578688201.0,"Not usually, he’s actually quite good at it and will ring them for my older corgi who refuses to ring the bells when she wants out as well. However, if it’s snowing? Yes he rings it incessantly!"
dogpictures,fdrq1dz,t1_fdrajgf,1578688023.0,That’s Ollie exactly in the heat. He HATES the hot.
dogpictures,fdqkg09,t1_fdqkcnx,1578668827.0,I’ve got to go outside momma! It’s the snow of my people!
dogpictures,fdqfrtd,t1_fdqfgqy,1578665550.0,"Berners are bred in the Swiss alps, my boy is actually 2 gen American. I don’t worry about him until it gets in the negatives, and even then he’s probably fine. We actually have the opposite problem of overheating and having to watch him constantly in the summer time. Thankfully it doesn’t get too hot here (yet)."
SupermodelCats,fdoi914,t1_fdohr68,1578605683.0,Thank you!
