The reality is if you are lower middle class and will never have the financial backing that others have then you need  to be clever and creative. I would say priority #1 should be study abroad. Not every place charges $36K a semester (Rome and Paris can cost this much). Studying abroad in a more ""out  of the way place"" changes everything. Places like Peru, Cambodia, Georgia, Indonesia are amazing and cost dramatically less in all aspects besides flights maybe.

Many schools (but not all) have deals with other international schools and, for you, it would work like this: you pay the exact same tuition to your school and go to another school for a semester. All you are responsible for is the flight and living arrangements. But you would have had to pay to live and eat at school anyway!"

Truth be told, I never even considered taking a year off because of the job implications, but I would have if my life long dream of the Peace Corps didn't pan out. However, if asked when the best time to travel is, I stand by my statement that the single best time to travel is directly after you graduate from college if you fall within the vast majority of people."
travel,ffrppsf,t3_euv5sv,1580163076.0,"The single best time to travel is directly after you graduate from college. Other people will say it’s anytime you have the money and ability, but they obviously didn’t read your post. Go for a year right after college if the wildcard of finances turns out in your favor.

Also, it would be the mistake of your life to not study abroad while you are in college. Make sure you study abroad in college. I cannot stress that enough. My advice for where to study abroad is this: go somewhere that you would never go normally. If you think you will have somewhat consistent travel throughout the rest of your life, then you will likely go to Paris and Rome and London and all the other major famous destinations, so instead think about going somewhere that excites you but is out of the way a little bit. 

Where my advice is coming from: I studied abroad in Tel Aviv, Israel (am not Jewish or a practicing Christian so I didn’t go for religious reasons) and it was fucking awesome. I was a double major in political science and Middle East studies so the region interested me, but I was blown away by just how cool Tel Aviv is. Directly after college I served in the Peace Corps for two years in Ethiopia (if you are looking to travel the world, do not join Peace Corps. If this is confusing direct message me and I will explain why). If I didn’t join the Peace Corps I would have found some other international program or just traveled the world.

Right after school offers more freedom than you will experience until retirement, and your body might not be up to the challenge then.

Side note: no, taking a year off after college and traveling will not hinder your chances of getting a job if you are a somewhat strong applicant. If anything, the perspective you will gain will likely make you more successful."

Only a beautiful person would go through the trouble of telling this story and sharing such a positive message. PC was lucky to have you. I think you are spreading an amazing message so keep at it!

Although I do not personally believe in a human's ability to predict the future in any way other than subconsciously analyzing and reacting to stimuli that we aren't even aware of (something that is proven and is very, very, very fucking cool), I am certainly aware of how little we know about the universe in general and am very open to the supernatural. I of course scoff at assertions like ""phones kill our intuition"" but realize how condescending that is. If I take it another way, it is likely very true that if you become abnormally preoccupied with something (like a phone) you will miss the subtle stimuli that you would normally pick up which makes perfect sense.

To play devil's advocate (*I am sure OP is aware of this, but it may be interesting to those reading*), the following can cause a feeling of impending doom:

* Certain Malaria prophylaxis (can also cause crazy dreams)
* Depression
* Anxiety disorders such as [panic disorder](https://www.verywellmind.com/types-of-panic-attacks-2584251) (during panic attacks), [generalized anxiety disorder](https://www.verywellmind.com/generalized-anxiety-disorder-4157247), [post-traumatic stress disorder](https://www.verywellmind.com/an-overview-of-ptsd-2797638), and more. (all things PCVs are at greater risk for).
* Bipolar disorder
* OCD
* Temporal lobe epilepsy

It's not unreasonable to claim that a certain amount of people that feel impending doom, according to the law of large numbers, actually experience some actual fucking doom which would only reenforce their belief that they can  ""see beyond the present or the now."" PCVs are more likely to fall into this category than other Westerners because they, quite simply, exist in more dangerous environments. There isn't anything necessarily wrong with this, but likely anything else, if taken to its extreme this can cause issues.

Of course, none of this really matters. No one can prove or disprove our ability to see the future. If feeling more in touch with the fabric of the universe helps you in literally any way then I say embrace it. If mentally telling people, like myself, to fuck off and have a nice day is your reflexive reaction then you are entitled to it.

I'll say it again: Only a beautiful person would go through the trouble of telling this story and sharing such a positive message. PC was lucky to have you."
