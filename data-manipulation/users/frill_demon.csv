DnDGreentext,ffk1rw9,t1_ffjid7r,1580013170.0,"Not just that, but rape is explicitly illegal in just about every society ever. They may have different definitions of what exactly constitutes rape, and whether it's illegal because the woman was someone else's property you ""stole"" or whether she is actually a human being who gets a say in the matter, but they still \*all\* have some version of it being illegal.

""Lawful"" evil people are basically like corrupt politicians or corporate loophole-abusers, they find things that ""should"" be illegal because they're morally wrong, but aren't explicitly punishable by law. Like if I go to a charity auction that has a ""donate whatever you want"" option, donate a penny and take $100 worth of stuff, I'd be a total asshole who missed the point, but I've technically followed the ""rules"" and haven't stolen anything. That's lawful evil."

It is literally part of their job to either be an expert in the thing itself or to gather a committee and educate themselves on the topic in order to make an informed decision.

Ignorance is a piss-poor excuse for someone who has the resources  available that a Senator does, they have literal teams of people at their beck and call, have some of them put together a broad spectrum risk-benefit analysis.

The average person has to have time to earn a living wage. It is utterly unreasonable to try and argue that they can compete with a company  employing several people whose sole and only full-time job is to lobby against whatever the individual would be lobbying for.

 Framing this as ""Individuals just need to take more responsibility!"" is a ridiculous attempt to gloss over how absurdly broken a system we have when the local branch of MegaCorp even \*can\* lobby for such an ability, let alone how broken it is that they succeed in the overwhelming majority of cases."
facepalm,ff41jek,t1_ff2znd1,1579553522.0,"I see where you're coming from, but I would argue that a majority of the people who use ""females"" in the way that the guy in the OP screencap did don't have a strong enough academic background to warrant using that scientific disassociation. Many people aren't attempting to have an academic discussion about biological sex characteristics, they simply picked it up from the prevalence of male/female instead of men/women in porn titles, or don't understand that the terminology they're using is literally intended to convey distance and academic observation. Men and women both do this, I've seen plenty of ""My man ain't allowed to talk to no other females/bitches/thots"" type statuses from trashy women, internalized misogyny often goes hand in hand with this type of distancing language as it can feed into an 'I'm not like other girls' complex. In both cases, it's typically used to classify half the population as ""other"" rather than make an observation about a person's biological sex."

facepalm,ff2054o,t1_ff1rgga,1579490284.0,So you use abstract academic language in a setting in which academic language is called for. Medical terminology is literally supposed to be impersonal. That same abstract clinical tone becomes a verbal uncanny valley when used in a social context.

No, they aren't. When you post in a forum you do so with the express intention of having a discussion with strangers. These women were, according to the man's own story, having a conversation unrelated to him with eachother in a coffee shop and he interrupted them. 


When you interrupt someone, you are basically saying ""Nothing you are saying could possibly be as important as what I am about to say, and therefore I am not even going to allow you to finish what you were talking about."" That is inherently rude even if you know the person, doubly so when you do not."

d) some random dude interrupts your conversation and just so happens to be the person that wrote it

&#x200B;

Literally no one would assume ""Gosh, this person who interrupted our conversation must clearly only have done so because he's the author!!"". A or B would probably be the case in 99% of scenarios, \*maybe\*  C happens 1% of the time.  

Even if he told them he was the author from the get-go, which one is the more likely scenario: that they happened to be discussing a piece in front of the author himself, or that some random dude decided to have a laugh by lying and saying he was the author? 

You only think their reaction was unreasonable because you have the benefit of hindsight."

cosplay,fdzhfqo,t3_enc5lz,1578790253.0,"Don't get me wrong, this looks really nice, but nothing in this suggests Sailor Jupiter to me. Only one element of her color palette is present, the facial markings and animal skin actively go against her character, and there are no other elements inspired by any of her aspects. If I saw this at a con I would assume it was an OC of some form from a medieval-ish fandom like Skyrim or GoT. 

Two things I would suggest that would immediately make this more related to Jupiter without undoing the corset-cutie aesthetic you're going for  would be to integrate her symbol or a lineart of her weapon onto your corset either by painting or embroidering it, and find a green&gold torc or circlet that's shaped similarly to the tiara she wears. 

I'm assuming you wanted to try and make her a little tougher-feeling, but roses are an integral part of Jupiter's motif and so would also more heavily relate this look as an alternate version of hers of you were to incorporate them."
