legaladvicecanada,ffbx2wk,t1_ffbrpmw,1579785586.0,Thank you for your help! The judge previously raked him over the coals for knowingly avoiding getting a job to avoid paying support and told me that if he ever did start paying it would be a miracle.
legaladvicecanada,ffbwrn9,t1_ffbrqw5,1579785310.0,It was to see how visitation was going and after 5 temp orders the judge granted me a final order. It states that visitation was at my discretion and that he needed to provide a notice of assessment going forward. Child support was set aside as he claimed undue hardship while he was in college.
legaladvicecanada,ffbqgxk,t1_ffb4b57,1579778581.0,"I've done that previously and he had quit the job once he was served. Which is why I am hesitant to go forward with it after reading the responses.. How do I prove he's working, short of getting a photo of him actually doing his job, I'm not sure how to prove it. He's 2.5 hrs away if that makes any difference to the situation."
legaladvicecanada,ffbpzpo,t1_ffb3xye,1579777925.0,The last time he had a visit with her was in July and he didn't show up for court in August. The judge is well aware of his no contact as its gone on for years at a time. I have given him a schedule for visitation through email and he told me that he won't see her until she's 18 and can decide for herself.
legaladvicecanada,ffaz7vv,t1_ffaz3md,1579747911.0,Thanks for the information! I'll definitely talk to someone about this as soon as I can. My friend lived with him for 6yrs from 2012 to 18 so she knows him lol they also live in the same city now that he's moved again. That's how I found out that he's working on the
legaladvicecanada,ffay0vl,t1_ffaxxsr,1579747122.0,No. Nothing has been set up but I was told that I could bring it to court at any time if things change.
legaladvicecanada,ffaxdxg,t1_ffax3ou,1579746699.0,"I should edit that I suppose. It was a final order for visitation, support wasn't set up because he had either not worked and been on welfare, or was in college. He recently got a job so I'm hoping he won't quit it once I file."
legaladvicecanada,ffawrlx,t1_ffawoci,1579746290.0,"No, there has never been an order to enforce."
