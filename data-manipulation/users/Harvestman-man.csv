I disagree that it’s the *biggest* factor- it’s probably the *second*-biggest factor.

After the evolution of birds, insect size throughout remained small, and did *not* fluctuate with oxygen levels, which means that predation by birds is actually the biggest factor (at least for flying insects, although there are plenty of other vertebrates that prey on terrestrial insects). 

See [this](https://www.pnas.org/content/109/27/10927.long) paper.

>You could also propose an evolution line where the insects' spiracle systems were more branched, creating more surface area for oxygen transfer, but this would make them more fragile. Or you could propose a more manual respiratory system, with muscles that contract and expand to push/pull air the way our lungs do.

Both of these things actually already exist in modern insects; I think one of the major issues is that in insects, oxygen is not transported through blood (or the analogous fluid: hemolymph) like it is in vertebrates- tracheae are simply empty tubes of air, unlike blood vessels and arteries.

>Why not just take a photograph and then release them? Live and let live?

Sometimes people want to be able to accurately identify their subject, so they know what it is they’ve seen. It’s often difficult, or sometimes impossible, to identify Arthropods with only a photo. 

There’s a sort of appeal to it, too, like Pókemon IRL; the creator of Pókemon has even said his hobby of insect-collecting is what inspired the creation of the game, which, needless to say, is hugely popular. “Collecting things” is something that people like to do in general.

Also, people can (and do) donate private collections to universities or museums; just because they’re collected for a personal collection doesn’t mean they can never be useful; note the importance of donated private collections in the [Queensland Museum Entomology collection](https://theworkshops.qm.qld.gov.au/Collections/Biodiversity+and+Geosciences/Biodiversity+Collections/Insects#.XiT2giRMElQ), and [this particular](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/03/24/521359417/octogenarian-couple-donates-10-million-insect-collection) private donation became kinda famous and made the mainstream news.

As far as the morality of it is concerned, I get that, but I don’t see it as being any worse than whatever fate an insect will experience in the wild. I think people like to romanticize nature, but really, most animals die unpleasant deaths before they even reach adulthood, and the environmental impact of entomological collections is pretty negligible."

Besides, most people kill Arthropods just for fun anyways and mutilate their bodies without collecting them. At least it’s more respectful this way. Since a large number of Arthropods have naturally very short adult lifespans anyways, they’ll just die on their own if kept as pets."

I also think you’re underestimating just how big vultures are. Compare the size of an [Eurasian eagle-owl](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C3yWQuLWIAENcro.jpg) (a huge bird, to be sure), with that of a [cinereous vulture](http://www.olkhontour.com/upload/tours/34_2932495.jpg); the cinereous vulture is 3-4 *times* as massive.

Also, were you aware of the [fact](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2014.1072) that Rüppell’s vultures and white-backed vultures routinely track eagles and (taking advantage of an eagle’s superior eyesight) follow them to find carcasses which the vultures take for themselves after bullying off the eagles? Vultures are very used to confrontation with other raptors, and tend to come out on top (unless they’re tiny vultures).

[Here’s](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xsWVxt5uS_0) a fun video where a cinereous vulture repeatedly spartan-kicks a golden eagle to the ground before the eagle relents and gives up a carcass; skip to 4:00 for the confrontation, and don’t miss the vulture’s intimidation display at 4:25. 

Vultures also niche-partition. Some species (like cinereous and lappet-faced vultures) are much larger than others, and they don’t all have the same feeding behavior, nor do they all sit on the same rung of the “scavenger hierarchy”. Lappet-faced vultures even [fight jackals](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/61/a6/19/61a61907b4d3a5a62804d6cbba3ab2ca.jpg) for the top spot on the hierarchy."

evolution,fe0tcxg,t1_fdzbc8h,1578818425.0,"There are some examples of taxa placed in old, outdated taxonomic arrangements, but that's not really the issue I have. 

There are many examples of a single obscure genus or species being placed at the base of a larger clade of totally unrelated animals:

* The species *Fasciosminthurus quinquefasciatus* is placed as the sister-taxon to the clade Chelicerata. This is a species of globular springtail, which belong to a totally different subphylum.

* The species *Heteromma fuegiana* is placed as the sister-taxon to all spiders. This is an oudated name for a species of sac spider now known as *Tomopisthes horrendus*. This is not a mistake of being ""outdated"", though (except the name), since this species has always been placed in the infraorder Araneomorphae, with the rest of the sac spiders. The actual basalmost spiders are the Mesothelae, which is not disputed at all.

* The genus *Minua* is placed as the sister-group to all harvestmen. This is an outdated name for a genus of armored harvestman now known as *Minuella*. Again, not a mistake of being ""outdated"", since it has always been placed in the suborder Laniatores, with the rest of the armored harvestmen. The actual basalmost harvestmen are the Cyphophthalmi. 

There seem to be fewer of these random taxa thrown around than last time I checked, so maybe they've fixed some, but I don't see any way of tracking their history of editing the tree.

Even if you ignore these randomly-inserted minor taxa (which you shouldn't, because understanding basal lineages is important for understanding the evolutionary history of the entire clade), there are still problems at the order-level:

* Pycnogonids/Pantopods are placed nested *within* the class Arachnida. While the position of Pygnogonids has been debated, I'm not aware of any studies that recover them as arachnids; they are instead thought to be the sister-group of Euchelicerates (arachinds+horseshoe crabs), or maybe an even earlier-diverging arthropod lineage. 

* Schizomids are placed as the basalmost order of arachnids. All studies (that I'm aware of) have recovered Schizomids as the sister-group to Thelyhonida; as a matter of fact, in the past, these two orders were commonly grouped together as a single order, Uropygi, and this relationship is one of the only rock-solid order-level relationships arachnid taxonomists actually agree on (the placement of many arachnid orders is uncertain), so I don't understand why Onezoom puts them here.

* Harvestmen are placed nested within the clade Anactinotrichida (Opilioacariformes+Parasitiformes). No studies (that I'm aware of) have ever recovered this configuration; although the placement of both harvestmen and Parasitiformes is uncertain, Many taxonomists don't even use the term ""Anactinotrichida"" anymore, and instead just treat Opilioacariformes as an order within Parasitiformes.  

In general, since the placement of many major arachnid groups is not fully resolved, it would be better to use polytomies instead of just randomly clumping together orders which we don't really know where to fit (like Ricinulei and Palpigradi, which are treated as sister-taxa in Onezoom, but certainly aren't).

Regarding harvestman taxonomy:

* The families Phalangodidae and Pyramidopidae are both placed within the superfamily Gonyleptoidea, even though both of these families are totally unrelated to Gonyleptoids, and have *never* been considered to be Gonyleptoids by any taxonomists ever, that I'm aware of. 

* The family Stygnopsidae is placed within the superfamily Epedanoidea, even though it is totally unrelated to Epedanoids; this family has more recently been resolved as a basal lineage of Gonyleptoidea, but as far as I'm aware, has never been grouped with the Epedanoids.

* The Isidiatores are all placed deeply-nested within the infraorder Grassatores, although they're regarded as either the sister-group to Grassatores, or to form a grade of basal lineages preceding the Grassatores.

* Family names like ""Gagrellidae"", ""Leiobunidae"", and ""Monoscutidae"", are used, despite being defunct names no longer used by actual taxonomists. Other (more recent) families, like Acropsopilionidae, Cryptogeobiidae, and Gerdesiidae are absent. You could cite ""outdatedness"" here, and while some of these changes are kinda recent (all of them still at least 5 years old, though), Gagrellidae and Leiobunidae in particular have been treated as subfamilies of Sclerosomatidae since 1992. 

That's a handful of issues, but there are more that I've noticed in harvestmen, and I don't know enough about other arthropod orders to fact-check them, but spiders and mites are certainly rife with similar errors. If you're brave enough to go down to the species-level, nothing makes sense at all (for example, why is *Leiobunum hiasai*, a Japanese species, placed as the sister-species to *Leiobunum apenninicum*, an Italian species, when in fact both of these species belong to different and unrelated formally-named species-groups?); it's obviously totally random, with more of an emphasis on looking pretty than on being correct.

Now, maybe if you look at mammals, it'll be more correct; there's certainly been far more studies done on far fewer species in that group, so it would be much easier to actually get a reliable tree. If you check their ""[data sources](https://www.onezoom.org/data_sources.html)"" tab, they list sources used for several larger groups, but all arthropods (notably- the most diverse lineage of all living organisms) have no ""data source"".

Glowing Womb is bad charm; if you equip Spell Twister instead, even a Shade Soul hitting a single target will deal more damage for the amount of Soul spent than Hatchlings will deal."

Duplications are important, though, as if you start with a duplication of a gene, that duplicated gene can be modified easily to generate novel phenotypes without damaging the function of the original gene. The evolution of aerobic citrate usage in a population of *E. coli* in the famous Lenski experiment, for example, was the result of a duplication mutation."
