I decided that I can get any information or book I need digitally - so I ditched them all.  And I figure that if it comes up again, that I need information, I'll just go the internet or download a book into Kindle.

Clutter problem solved!"

I've been living like this for decades.  Thought it was just me.

And I suspect that they would.   I believe the ACH method is free, but I will definitely double check.

aww,fdi4gpv,t3_elegoj,1578435566.0,"This brings to mind the movie ""The Shawshank Redemption"".  Red, during his life sentence, went in front of a parole board, and was asked if he was ""rehabilitated"".  The first 4-5 times, he tried to say the right things, thinking to say what he thought the board wanted to hear.  On the final time they asked him the question and his answer was along the lines of ""I may, and I may not be, but it really doesn't matter because you people will just do what you want anyways.""   With that statement of basic detachment, the parole board released him.

I wonder what it was about this cat that kept him from being adopted for 7 years.  And what changed in her that finally made someone adopt her.
