geckos,ffdrqd0,t3_esz47u,1579827298.0,"My opinion on the matter is that no gecko is ‘off limits’ for a first pet as long as he puts in all the hard work, research, and care. A crestie is probably a good choice, though. Easy to handle, relatively small, friendly, and has plenty of care guides and research put into them, unlike some of the harder species to care for. Personally I started with a leopard gecko, but honestly, he’s a little nightmare. Then again I came in a bit underprepared... so what I’m saying in, any gecko he wants as long as he does the work, cresties are great. That is all"
