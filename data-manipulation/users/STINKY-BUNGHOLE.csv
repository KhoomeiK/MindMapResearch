when a guy uses the word ""female"" as a noun, but uses ""guy"", ""dude"", ""man"", ""chad"" etc, they use FEEEEMALE to dehumanize and depersonalize the opposite gender, like they're ""other"", separate from them; the guys, the dudes, the *men* because feemales aren't equal to them.

Plus meeting John in a secluded building doesn't help his case, very dramatic.

""Season 4 fucking sucked"" is the hill I will die on and I am so willing to rant about it anytime it's brought up. ***Besides*** the Eurus bullshitery, how Mary's death was handled was such a cop out, like either let her live and carry on or let her die and that be the death of her, saving videos of her saved for after the fact is weak writing. I know it's supposed to draw parallels to Sherlock's birthday wishes video, but a cop out is still a cop out. A friend of mine brought up a *good fucking point* when she said calling John and Sherlock ""her Baker Street Boys"" was so cringey, once that was pointed out, the send off was made so much worse. Sherlock was **never** 'her's', heck, John was barely her's, even through Season 3 John was holding a torch for Sherlock. Plus her videos being the send off just shows how fucking far Moffat went off on the deep end, SHERLOCK was about John and Sherlock, them being bffs and their adventures, now there's this weird tinge of possession and narrative that now they live on for Mary. Fuck that.

Call me basic, but John is my favourite character, I find his emotional side very endearing- even his anger, and through season 1 to 3, he was Sherlock's humanity and anchor, 8/10 pretty good friend. Which made the dialog of Sherlock reminding John he's human so fucking dumb, but I digress.... Martin Freeman was the perfect choice."

>Anything gentler wouldn't have been enough.

EXCEPT John may have been the most gentle person Sherlock ever met. Though John's experience and expertise is what had Sherlock gravitated towards in the beginning, John complimenting him without hesitation, following him without a complaint, *staying with him*. Pushing him into the public because Sherlock is great and deserves ever bit of recognition he gets for his work.

I didn't really compare Molly to John, I compared Molly before John, who John is in the bigger picture and what Molly is afterwards. John is Sherlock's catalyst, which makes him Molly's turning point as well"
Sherlock,fddfmao,t3_eepa0w,1578310098.0,"late to the party, but there's one thing you're failing to realize in your own post: you're comparing her to John.

BEFORE John, Molly was a meek, self doubting, push over. It could have been months or even years that Sherlock was using Molly's morgue for his experiments, but through that time she was using subtle methods to get his attention romantically; using makeup, fixing her hair, asking if he wanted to go for coffee in a shy and gentle manner, only to be misinterpreted or even missed on all of them. Before John she could have never imagined she would join Sherlock in a case, slap him, see his sadness or possibly be depended on by him. The big thing is that Molly put Sherlock on a pedestal, sure she wanted to go out with him, but she never did straighten her shoulder, look him in the eye and say ""I want to go on a date with you."" because he was intimidating, sharp and flippant.  

John on the other hand had Sherlock immediately interested because Sherlock knew he had experience, thrived on adrenaline and possibly was broken in a way  Sherlock was able to relate to. During the course of their friendship, it isn't expressed in the show, but by simply going through the passage of time, John had humanized and socialize Sherlock in ways Molly would never be able to do on her own. It took John wearing Sherlock down for Molly to realize that Sherlock is just another vulnerable person who has values and worries.

She only slapped Sherlock because he was being a selfish, insensitive prick, which she knew he isn't because she helped him fake his death so the people he valued wouldn't get hurt, namely John. She also joined Sherlock in a case because Sherlock was feeling lonely without John, because he was getting on with his lif withhout Sherlock. 

Molly is a doctor in her own right, she has her own strengths and weaknesses and she's deeply infatuated with Sherlock, but John is the catalyst to Sherlock's life."
