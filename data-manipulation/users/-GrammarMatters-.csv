I would simply never forgive myself if something tragic happened to her because she had to live in a “very rough” part of the city knowing I could’ve done something to help prevent it.

I was hooked up to machines, electrodes and IV’s while dressed in a hospital gown for damn near a month while they waited for the steroids to make my son’s lungs strong enough to breath on their own, and after the 3rd amino, they induced me immediately. I had more cervix checks than I can possibly count, and more people staring at my vagina than I care to remember. The next pregnancy, I fully abrupted lost more than 1/2 my blood, almost died in emergency surgery, and tragically lost the baby too, so don’t talk to me about messy; the room looked like a horror movie and an intern fainted.

Parenting,fdkaqug,t1_fdjxnaz,1578499901.0,"Well, you’re being intentionally vague and obtuse about a lot of things, and it’s hard for us to give you the advice and support for which you asked from us without the details. You didn’t say what you found on the phone besides more details about sexual activity. What? Drinking? Drugs? Petty theft? Torturing small animals? 

Listen, parents of teenagers/young adults and parents of small children are different creatures. We have to be because we so much less control over pretty much everything, and teenagers are inherently sneaky and ingenious. When you’re a parent of children that span all ages, that’s even more challenging. When you’re parenting children who are not your own like step-children, you’ve hit another level of difficulty. You, my friend, are parenting a teenager who is not only not your own, but to whom you have no biological ties whatsoever, while having your own small children in the house, and you made it permanent. I commend you - I really do. 


However, something horrible must’ve happened in this child’s life to bring this whole thing about - something epically tragic. Please don’t lose sight of that! Don’t compare her to other children who are her age or hold her to the same standard. She may seem fine on the outside, but again, she’s just trying to survive, because that is every human being’s first instinct. You asked if you were being too harsh, and as of last night, the answers were a resounding yes. Not because anyone thinks you’re bad people, but from the outside, it’s so very clear that this child is broken. If you go through with everything you laid out, you will not heal her; you will not help her.

PS. I recommend - Don’t ask your youngest son to snitch on your adoptive daughter - That just reinforces the idea in everyone’s mind that she’s the outsider. I’m of the opinion that you don’t ask any of your children to snitch on another. Sibling bonds should be strong and last for a lifetime. Trust and loyalty are essential."
Parenting,fdj99sj,t3_eldxst,1578462163.0,"I understand your alarm and concern, but you should never make rash decisions, especially ones that are life-altering for your niece. It is much easier to hand down and enforce harsher sentences to children who are not your biological offspring. Do not do this to her without getting FAMILY counseling and guidance!!!

She is not the only 14 year old in the world having sex. She is not manipulative and evil. She is trying to survive and be everything that everyone wants her to be. Do you honestly think that she’s enjoying sex with 16 and 17 year-old boys? Or is she enjoying the affection and attention (love in her mind) she is receiving from them? She obviously wants you guys to be proud of her and love her or she wouldn’t have hidden what she knew you would deem as wrong. 

She is not amoral. She is a young teenager who needs guidance and support - not shame and isolation! Help her be the best version of herself. You don’t have to agree or like every itty bit of her - trust me you won’t like every bit of your biological kids when they’re teenagers either. 

Remember, Sex is a biologically based instinct driven by species’ innate desires for survival. It is not a reflection of an individual person’s worth or character. It’s certainly never linked to a man’s worth or moral character.

Sex does have real physical and emotional consequences though. Calmly explain those to her, but for God’s sake, don’t blow up her life. She will run away or kill herself for real. In a teenager’s  mind, everything is fatal! This is not fatal. It was just some poor choices."
secretsanta,fdgdleb,t1_fdg0h4y,1578391713.0,"I definitely enjoy giving more than receiving, and I love being a rematch because people are often genuinely bummed out and disappointed when they are forgotten by their Santas and don’t receive presents. It is great to have the means and the desire to make it up to them as a rematch Santa, so I totally get what you’re saying about that part. However, if you truly don’t like receiving gifts, and you sign up for the exchanges just so so you can be a rematch Santa then maybe you should explore other gift-giving options, of which there are hundreds of worthy and extremely rewarding options. For example, you can contact a local domestic violence shelter, and adopt a family for the holidays. I try to make little holiday gift bags for all the women in the emergency shelter that contain beauty and self care products, and chocolate. Kiddos get backpacks with books, school supplies, fidgets, and snacks. That’s just one option. Or if you want to keep doing Reddit’s exchange’s, you could even write in your profile that in lieu of gifts donations to such-and such would be appreciated. And finally, go get your stress ball."

When we first moved in, we had air mattresses (gifted to me by a wonderful friend) and no couch or table or dressers or anything. We didn’t have cable or internet for well over a year and a half. I had food stamps and TANF because my ex-husband never paid child support. I budgeted everything on $280/month. This was 2010, so still deep in the middle of the recession. You have to work to get TANF and food stamps, but there were no jobs, so I volunteered for the Red Cross 35 hours/week. Around 2014, things picked up. The company I started is doing really well, and I stopped receiving public assistance around 2015. I have more furniture and tv channels than I need. I’m now saving for a down payment on a house, which is really hard bc my State’s economy has recovered and housing has increased close to 300% since 2012, but I’ll get there eventually.

I like that you can upvote/downvote people and hold them accountable (until they delete) for things they post.

Sure, Reddit is definitely not perfect, but it’s much better than other SM sights because people are held to a somewhat higher standard (limited emojis make you think and use your words). Some of the wittiest comments/posts I have ever read came from Reddit. I’ve read stories that have touched my soul, and I’ve shared them with others.  You can customize the topics you want to read about, and explore the rabbit hole of everything else you never even thought possible. You can find your people. Lol

Anyway, I reordered the stuff I could, but the eBay seller’s items were unavailable (this was the HarryPotter exchange last year). I messaged her, explained the situation, and she kindly remade the oven mitts and kitchen towel and threw in a candle and some coasters and other knickknacks as a super kind gesture because she felt so bad for my giftee too. Contact the sellers and explain the situation... that’s my advice."

AskReddit,fcr6bfb,t1_fcr5p44,1577897418.0,I think it’s always good to rotate the sorting.
AmItheAsshole,fckrue7,t3_ehpx6d,1577731828.0,YTA and you’re rationalizing it.

AmItheAsshole,fckqrrb,t3_ehpsul,1577731168.0,"NTA Ordinarily, I would say you’re the asshole bc you shouldn’t be telling someone else what products to use, but personal hygiene in shared living quarters is the exception. Plus, studies have shown that the Aluminum Zirconium in spray deodorant linked to Alzheimer’s. You’re all breathing that shit into your lungs. Not showering on the regular can be a sign of depression. Maybe there are other issues with your sister that need to be addressed."

Btw...if you do quit, please use the extra time to brush up on your spelling, vocabulary, and grammar."
AskReddit,fc6br4s,t1_fc6awvi,1577476871.0,"I drive a lot too. I’m a private tutor and drive to my students. I drive probably 25,000 miles/year for work. I make sure the lumbar support is mid-back and out pretty far. I keep my seat back really far (I’m 5’10” and my 6’1” son keeps it closer than I do). I try to keep my hands at 10 and 2 to keep my elbows out and my shoulders down and back. If I find myself hunched, I just try to correct. My older son tried one of those strappy posture corrector thingys for when he was at his computer. He said it worked, but hurt."
