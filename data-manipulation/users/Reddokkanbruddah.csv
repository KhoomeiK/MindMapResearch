AskReddit,ffhw1ya,t1_ffhrw0f,1579956499.0,Where did they hurt you?
AskReddit,ffhvzww,t1_ffhqo2n,1579956431.0,"You can change this, if your interested in not being hated by everyone around you."
AskReddit,ffhvpzl,t1_ffhmvv5,1579956094.0,"Could be. In my experience (if you actually are too nice a guy), it's because the gal that called you too nice is usually kind of jacked up and doesnt want to ruin your ""innocence"""
AskReddit,ffhvbiv,t1_ffhlq5b,1579955590.0,"Have you tried not giving a damn? I know it's hard to get past being self-conscious, but I was very similar. Showered twice daily and used the strongest deodorant I could find, but it would still only last about an hour before my pits start to smell at room temperature. I'm also a heavy sweater, so when I realized that nothing worked I just stopped all together.

Sure I may not raise my arms to high in room, but I don't even bother with deodorant and I feel tremendously better about myself. Maybe it will work for you."
AskReddit,ffhut76,t3_eto99o,1579954925.0,"""Dick too big, might kill someone"" 

Kidding of course, but for me it's because i haven't met someone as outgoing and excitable as me. Well, except the girl who just asked me for my phone number a couple of days ago. She's real fun so far."
AskReddit,ffhrk47,t3_etnhf3,1579950176.0,"No, it encourages people to be confident with how they are and to not hate on themselves more then anything. 

Which leads to yes. It's that little itty bitty thought in the back of the head that says ""eh, I don't *have* to"".

It's so very easy to lose weight (excluding medical reasons) but most often it's being ""tired"" or a lack of self control that really gets people.

I don't blame people for being overweight. One of the purposes of life is to find the easiest way to do your hard work so that you have time to spend your energy else where and instead of going out and exploring or walking around or creating, people can be found vegging out days on  end in the same spot without moving. I used to do it as well. Luckily, I made the life change before It became really bad. 

Now, a huge portion of this is our(American) society. Why in the hell are our poor people *fat*? That's because we are worked so very hard and don't have time to make, grow, and process our own food. The reason healthy food is so expensive is because no one grows their own food anymore. It's shipped all over the damned place and has to have special refrigeration in order to keep it fresh as possible, which is pricey. Seriously, if you want to lose weight and be healthier at the same time, start a farm or help on a local farm.

Most importantly, don't hate yourself for being fat. Just understand that it *is* unhealthy and should you decide to make a change, commit to it. I believe in you!"
bestof,ffhpiin,t1_ffhox78,1579947000.0,"That's a very terrible way to use the term racist. There's a reason it has a negative connotation to it. 

It goes without saying, that for a very long time, if you weren't white you were treated like shit. So a lot of white people understand that and like to try to help people of color who make up a large percentage of impoverished people's and, of course, a big reason that those people are impoverished is because of white people."

wholesomegreentext,ffc5gla,t3_esrmpx,1579791971.0,It's really that easy. A LOT of issues with people today are predominantly because of their sedintary lifestyle. And over eating.
aww,ffatojd,t3_escx1y,1579744244.0,"Like someone else said, I've seen this behavior before. I personally believe that it make be [a little more sinister](https://youtu.be/EneFmy8h1wQ) than we thought..."
worldnews,ffasaj1,t3_esbk8p,1579743321.0,"Have we considered that this is our time. Just because we are human doesn't mean the planet isn't designed to reset itself every now and then. Of course we are speeding that up but.. oh well.

Maybe this is more of a shower thoughts kinda thing."
AskReddit,ffapeg0,t3_esba7m,1579741380.0,"Confidence, straight forward-ness, and just be fuckin' nice. Nice to me,  the neighbor, the girl down the street. Seriously sick and tired of people being so mean to each other."

AskReddit,ff7vic7,t1_ff7ff3l,1579659343.0,"Yeah, I don't really do the hipster thing, I'm more of a cowboy type guy. Good luck in your conquests as well!"
AskReddit,ff615lo,t3_eru7eb,1579616474.0,"Probably do what I plan on doing once I have a job again, a small cute pile of tattoos on my left leg, of all the nicknames and things that I like. I'm excited for like 6 years from now."
AskReddit,ff5y0dd,t3_erpq3l,1579613935.0,"How simple it is. Porn has all of those weird and awkward positions, but if you stick with the basics, most people are satisfied without that stuff."
AskReddit,ff5xpny,t1_ff5uvv4,1579613680.0,"Agreed. I've been with around 10-12 partners and only 2 of them provided the ""fit like legos"" experience. 

Even then, their personalities were too different from mine so relationships didn't work."
