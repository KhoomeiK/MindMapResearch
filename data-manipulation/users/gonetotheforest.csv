I just recently left a 6 year relationship and it was devastating. It’s still hard, and I’m still trying to find a place to live and everything. But I feel so much more stable mentally. I actually saw a woman today that was sooo cute. Usually, being attracted to another woman was sooo painful, in so many ways. But this time I was just like “hey I’m attracted to her.” And I would have hit on her more (if you count my awkward small talk and giggling as flirting), but I want to get my shit together before I feel comfortable pursuing anyone. 


Coming out has been so freeing. I’m more confident in myself, and somehow I’m seeing a lot more lesbians now!!

What REALLY changed my world was the show Gentleman Jack on HBO. If you don’t have HBO, you can but it on YouTube. I wish I could experience my first time watching that show. It was so amazing. I sat there glued to the tv, mouth agape, and would cry instantly because it’s just so good. 

There’s a podcast about the show. It’s on Spotify and called Shibden After Dark. That podcast was also life changing. 

I owe so much of my growth to shows, podcasts, and social media groups. It’s been such a painful journey. Every life hardship is scary enough, but lgbt people are never given the option to cope in a healthy way, and grief will quickly turn into something toxic. 

I’m so grateful for the nice side of the internet, and social media and shows."
latebloomerlesbians,ff7fs3a,t1_ff7e53g,1579648538.0,"I’ve started taking notes on my favorite quotes from the episodes that she’s in. So far I’ve only gotten like halfway done with this one. 


“You can only live according to one set of truths at a time [...] at  time, you were making choices that reflected a certain set of values, desires and interests and awareness about yourself. “


“... When people don’t understand or don’t relate to the process of actually acknowledging such a degree of conflict that you do something as bold as leave a life behind [...] they go to what’s most comfortable, which is judgement, and that’s probably a reflection of their own shame. “


“Don’t be afraid to grieve the choices that you didn’t make, because with every set of choices you’re also choosing to lose out on something else. “


“That’s what truth does; you can’t fight it, you can’t stop it, it will find a way out [...] truth loves momentum, but so does shame though, and so truth can compete with shame for attention. And fear is a very close cousin of shame. Anytime you start to actually get bold enough to make some choices, especially if they’re choices that are going to bring you closer to exposure, fear is gonna kick in first and then shame is right there behind it. “"

His father was going to ruin the entire family’s chance of survival and they’re much better off without him. Thomas already has to deal with the trauma of having an abusive father, and now  has to deal with the trauma and guilt of murdering him."

dykesgonemild,fc6ep2h,t3_egd2cv,1577478802.0,"I’m proud of you!! 

I just started being open about my relationship with alcohol. My dad is an addict and an alcoholic, so I’ve always tried to be very self aware. 

For the past several months I started drinking a lot to try to cope with my anxieties about leaving my heterosexual relationship & coming out, then I kept drinking because of the grief. I’m finally starting to cut back, but that doesn’t say much because I really was drinking a lot. 

I’ve always heard that the LGBT community is more likely to suffer from depression and addiction, and now I kinda have a first hand experience of that. It’s scary and sad, but I’m working through it."
