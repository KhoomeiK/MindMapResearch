You don't take as much offense as they intend by saying it. That's the difference, the people who like to throw that around genuinely believe that communism/socialism is responsible for a death toll 3-4x the Nazis and state such things often. When they throw that label around they are intending to label people as 3-4x worse than a Nazi, which they do for such things as supporting healthcare or a tax rate above zero.

The argument here is that, like in pugs, humans have so exacerbated a trait we find desirable that we have crippled the animals themselves purely for our own benefit.  

It's a valid position but it's not without flaws either, symbiosis like that evolves naturally all the time, there are plenty of things out there that have traded the ability to survive on their own for the increased survival offered by the symbiote.  In this case it's humans and sheep, we get wool and the sheep survive and breed at rates they never could have without being domesticated.

That said though we do often use modern knowledge to push things to extremes that were never possible before and that is moving the needle on some of these relationships from symbiotic to parasitic.

M3s and Camaros both tip the scales at nearly 4k lbs so the handling advantage is almost all suspension tuning and tire choice.

I'm not saying that all those people need to buy Tesla's but outside of the noise or the looks pretty much all their other reasons for not buying them boil down to paper spec bragging rights which is a stupid reason to buy a car."

interestingasfuck,fcuptyi,t1_fcujlhf,1577986083.0,"Lol you can't stop your average garage door motor with your fingers and most of those are 1/8th to 1/4 hp. Most motors that power vehicle hoists are 3/4 hp, you would get your entire body wrapped around one of them before it stopped.

HP is fairly meaningless in this kind of discussion as it's just a function of torque and rpm. (Ft. Lbs * RPM/5250=HP). If it's a high RPM 1hp motor you can pretty easily stop it with your fingers (as long as it has a low enough mass to avoid friction burns anyway) as it produces very little torque. However if the max rpm is low it will just start ripping bits off you if you try it.  Most electric motors have an exponentially decreasing torque curve with rpm as well so at high speed they are very inefficient resulting in very low HP ratings but at near zero rpm they can produce hundreds if not thousands of foot lbs of torque.  For reference people with extremely strong hands and wrists might be able to apply 10 ft lbs without any leverage advantage but even that is kinda pushing it as most of your strength is in your arms and they are hard to bring to bear without a lever."

I keep trying to explain to you the simple fact that you don't have a clue about the things you speak, despite your continued insistentance that you do. I get that you understand it so poorly you can't even grasp why your situation is nothing like the one you are trying to empathise with but I meant it sincerely when I said if you want to help kindly sit the fuck down and shut up. Your attempts at both sidesing for the sake of kumbaya are about as effective as a beauty pageant contestants pleas for world peace, hell they are actually doing a better job as you are actively making shit worse by essentially claiming not only that you are in a position to understand things that you do not, but that your aspersions cast against others should carry extra weight because you are an ""ally"".

What you are in effect doing is providing an incredibly effective tool to support those looking to do your friend harm and exactly fuck all to stop the <8 people in the country who threaten violence over a single accidental pronoun slip.

Get this through that arrogant head, you aren't doing what you are intending, you don't understand at all why people who are angry are angry and until you do, you have zero right to sit in judgement of any of them and even if you actually were somehow correct your ignorance in assuming that people who are looking for reasons to support their existing beliefs will look at statements like this as anything other than proof that ""even LGB people and their allies hate trans people"" is staggering.

You intentionally made yourself look like a boy and you were called one, that's a massive, MASSIVE fucking gulf apart from clearly and painfully visibly making an effort to be gendered a certain way and having someone do the opposite anyway.  Even old people are still smart enough to determine pronouns of someone in a dress and makeup, you don't fucking have to ask about that.

Shit like this is the equivalent of rich people telling kids who speak about their struggles with student loan interest they should just borrow money from their family to pay them off.  I imagine you'd lecture kids with no shoes about how it easy it is to pull ones self up with your own bootstraps...  I really really want to use some choice words here as that smug bullshit like that is frankly infuriating but I'm not going to.

Suffice to say your arrogance and ignorance is at least in service of a well meaning idea, but seriously if you want to genuinely help, go back to sheltering memorabilia and kindly butt the fuck out.  You have a lot to learn before you have anything useful to bring to these kinds of things and your judgement of those who get angry is as thoughtless as your beliefs that you understand anything because you once went through a bit of a tomboy phase out of insecurity."

That said this sort of thing is not transactional in nature, you don't earn LGBT credits you can spend elsewhere by doing nice things. Offsetting a wrong does not equal not doing wrong I guess is what I'm trying to say.

I also understand that you can't possibly know what pronouns actually mean to people, you've never had people get the fundamental part of your identity wrong. You've never tried to get people to recognize who you are and have them not only flat out refuse to see you that way but even bother with pretending they respect you enough to try. I could tell you to try and imagine what life would be like if everyone thought you were a girl, people called you by female pronouns by accident and always treated you like you were a girl even if they called you by male pronouns because ultimately in their mind you were female because your body looked girlish and they just dismissed your instance on being male as some weird belief of yours they were trying to respect. I would ask but you can't, because even if you could imagine it for a second you could never imagine what it feels like of a lifetime of that. What it feels like to grow up constantly on guard because your intuitions and natural behavior didn't fit your gender norms and accidently letting that show would get you mocked or worse. You can't know what it is that you dismiss as silly bullshit about word choices.  Literally nobody gives a fuck about the pronouns, it's the fact that nobody sees us as who we are because of a birth defect and when we ask for the bare minimum of respect in getting addressed properly at least it's met with hand waiving and complaints that we are being unreasonable because ""it's just a word and it doesn't mean anything"". It's true, it is meaningless but asking for you to actually think of us as who we are rather than just act like it isn't possible, so yeah we settle for the meaningless gesture of asking people to make a half ass attempt at hiding their true feelings as they are deeply hurtful. So sorry that even such basic niceties as not actively showing your disapproval of someone is beyond your grasp and hurtful to demand of you..."

AskReddit,fbwyasw,t3_eetf7i,1577162793.0,"Long Story:

My elementary school was infested with yellow jackets, they had traps on like every building but there were still angry yellow assholes everywhere.  I hated the bees as I had been stung on multiple occasions by that point and they generally seemed to go after me at every opportunity.  So I started to spend my recesses killing them, we had these plastic scoop things for throwing whiffle balls back and forth with and I discovered that if you whacked a wasp with it, they would get stunned but not die.  Well once I had stunned bees I started looking for ways to mess with them, magnifying glasses, pulling wings off and the like then I discovered by accident one day that if you drop one in an ant trail the ants would attack the yellow jackets and they would wake up and fight back...  So I had gladiatorial bouts for a while.

You would think this story is weird and creepy enough right?  Wrong, my little psychopathic ass wasn't done yet.  I was a curious little shit and in my messing with these things I discovered that squeezing the wasps butt would cause the stinger to pop out.  So now I was curious, would it still do anything even if the wasp was dead?  So I did the only logical thing and I poked a kid I was sorta friends with it in the leg to see.  Turns out this kid is allergic to bee stings, he doesn't die or anything but his leg swells up and he was screaming and crying(this was like 1st grade).  So yeah, causes a big hoopla, I was genuinely sorry about it as I honestly didn't think it would do anything so I didn't get in major trouble but the school wound up having like a PSA campaign about how ""even if bees are dead the stinger is still alive"" crap or something to warn of the dangers, lol.  

TL:DR was a near psychopath to yellow jackets, discovered that their stingers could be extended by squeezing their butts, promptly stung some other kid with it and caused a school assembly about bee stinger safety."
