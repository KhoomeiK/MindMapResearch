Can science explain why the placebo effect happens ?  Or why some people are able to lower and raise their body temps with their mind.  Can science explain biology of belief ?  Can science explain thousands of people healing themselves of cancer ?  Science can’t explain everything.  What people call pseudo science millions of people around the world have been using with results for thousands of years.  Probably because the placebo effect, but again that is something science can’t begin to touch or explain.  

There are many many things science can’t explain.  For instance how does toxoplasmosis work?  Toxoplasmosis knows more about the human brain and mind than all of science combined.  Science says Ayurvedic medicine don’t work, people have been using them for hundreds of thousands of years.  I think people wouldn’t be using it still today if it didn’t work.  Science are things that we have discovered and there is a lot more we haven’t discovered."

Stadia,fcn89ha,t1_fckgunt,1577805834.0,"I 100% agree with everything you said.  I’m a huge ps4 fan myself.  I love my ps4, but yes if the ps5 is 9.2 teraflops as they say Im not buying it for a long time.  But I highly doubt the rumor is true.  I mean the ps4 pro is almost 9 teraflops itself how could this rumor be true ?  The ps4 pro is like 8.8 teraflops.  You mean to tell me Sony is this stupid ?  So stupid to try and sell us an upgraded ps4 pro? I don’t buy it one bit.  

Also this rumor came out back in July I believe.  I don’t know why it came back up.  I think if some one like myself a die hard Sony fan wouldn’t buy it then they are in huge trouble if it’s true.  Also the Xbox having 12 teraflops isn’t 100% true either they are both rumors.  This link told me everything I need to know from digital foundry https://youtu.be/0PqMj6aSYH0"
