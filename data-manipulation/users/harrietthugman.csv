politics,fffvybw,t1_fffjqhz,1579892985.0,"Many people talk about reconciliation. The reason so few take issue with it is that M4A is a necessity without which tens of thousands will die annually, hundreds of thousands will go bankrupt, and tens of millions will go uninsured or underinsured. The US is in a state of emergency surrounding its crippled healthcare system and budget reconciliation is currently the best proposed option to quickly, effectively, and affordably provide care. 

There are a ton of issues with the presidency and abuse of executive power. This isn't one of them, and it's a confusing hill to die on given how many other contenders propose negative use of executive overreach. Biden supports warmongerin abroad, especially with Iran. Buttigieg is down to ramp up drug wars with US forces. But Sanders' M4A plan is a bridge too far? It's a double standard, and the inconsistency confuses me. 

What's equally confusing is that you dropped your support of Sanders over this issue, to also turn around and oppose him. What about Sanders appealed to you in the first place if budget reconciliation caused you to wage a personal campaign against him?

It's peculiar to see someone target Sanders' proposed use of budget reconciliation (to give the largest economic power in the world adequate healthcare) as a negative, much less a reason not to vote for him. If you ""can't stomach misinformation"", take a look at every other candidate's proposals and wage a campaign against them, too. Otherwise your whole presentation comes across as hypocrisy and willful ignorance *at best,* and not some principled crusade against.....budget reconciliation. I'm all for constructive criticism and alternative proposals, but that's not what you've provided."
politics,fffhlsq,t1_fffer5c,1579884139.0,"Sanders wrote *the* GND. His platform expands upon it and uses it as a framework for nearly every policy. Other candidates pay a GND lip service without explaining what they mean. 

For someone who spends that much time ragging on Sanders and his supporters, you seem to know little about his ideas or his policies."
politics,fffecwt,t1_fffc2i0,1579882115.0,"I can see that, and I hope the public may finally hold corporate media accountable. CNN was laughed at during their own debate, and it seems like folks are becoming more cynical of corporate media as a whole.

It also helps that ""not me, us"" is his slogan. It takes away the edge. 

I also think he's relying on the ""common sense"" element of his policies to appeal to centrists, ie the fact that M4A is cheaper than the current system by focusing on the public good over profit/shareholders (an early Buttigieg campaign talking point that was dropped after his flip on M4A). Sanders will make for an interesting coalition either way"

agedlikemilk,ff7lhh6,t1_ff7avey,1579652388.0,">i suppose my counter argument is that if being a politician isn’t a career, then only people who can afford economic instability can hold office.

I mean, that's basically the current system minus a few exceptions like AOC (who famously couldn't find affordable housing in DC before she was sworn in). The average working-class political aspirant is starting the race a mile behind corporate-backed establishment candidates. 

Most elected officials are filthy rich, from McConnell to Pelosi, and use their positions/legal insider trading to enrich themselves and their families. Many others started rich and succeeded due to personal connections, cronyism, or corporate experience. 

Getting money out of politics won't solve everything, but it's an excellent and necessary first step toward what you propose (a more egalitarian democracy)"

Or when Walmart shuts down local affiliates who mention unionizing.

Or when corporate propaganda misleads workers to the functions of unions.
