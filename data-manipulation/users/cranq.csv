ontario,ffgx19d,t1_ffg6zd3,1579917234.0,Gerrymandering and voter suppression are very real and dangerous things in the USA.  Even more so now that more accurate polling and data management by political parties (especially the ones with deep pockets) can target that shit with unprecedented accuracy.
canada,ff5exmj,t1_ff49nyy,1579589944.0,"Not sure that rule makes sense once you retire.  If you don't have a pension and have investments to live on, then you start to draw on those, and your percentage of net worth in your house starts to grow.  By the time you hit 80, you should have 10 percent of your net worth in your house according to this rule.  Sounds like you need enough non-house savings to grow your investments in retirements.  Hang on a sec while I pull that out of my ass..."
Guelph,ff4qg59,t1_ff4bzk6,1579569972.0,"Charged is not the same as proven.  If you are saying names should not be released until convicted, then I agree.

And even then, with plea deals being pushed on suspects (especially on those without the resources to hire good legal aid), conviction does not always mean guilty of the crime."

> Trickle-down economics generally does not work because:

> - Cutting taxes for the wealthy often do not translate to increased rates of employment, consumer spending, and government revenues in the long-term.
> - Instead, cutting taxes for middle-and lower-income earners will drive the economy through the trickle-up phenomenon.
> - The added income for the wealthy, resulting from tax cuts, will simply increase the growing income inequality in the United States."

They also cancelled a planned surtax on some of the highest earning Ontarians proposed by the previous Liberal government in its last budget that would have generated $275 million in revenue.  Not technically a tax cut, but similar in spirit."
ontario,ff0i1ot,t1_ff0bdw1,1579469075.0,"Witness our current Provincial regime.  They are attempting to hold public sector wages to a 1% increase.  This is being challenged in court, and most legal experts agree that the limit will be struck down, it basically suppresses the right to collective bargaining.  

I think our current regime is trying to kick the can down the road until the next election.  If another party is elected (likely with DoFo's trajectory so far) then they will have to deal with the fallout (back pay, penalties, etc).

I believe this is often a large part of the Conservative playbook. Slash and burn, and when the disastrous consequences of their actions become clear, it will be someone else's job to fix things, which of course costs money, and then they can just chirp from the sidelines about fiscal responsibility.

Rinse and repeat."

electricvehicles,fd69zfm,t1_fd2fpqe,1578187786.0,"True, some road wear is invariant over different axle weights, but some is definitely proportional to it.  So maybe the tax structure should reflect that.

If we could only do a non biased study to show what the different factors in road maintenance (and it's not all surface wear, other road oriented infrastructure too) then maybe we could come up with some kind of sane tax structure.  Which may have to vary by region, as weather is a factor too."

electricvehicles,fd09gjw,t1_fd06s4a,1578115611.0,"Electric cars do weigh more than ICE cars of the same size.  For example, [an average Tesla weighs about as much as an SUV](https://www.quora.com/Do-Teslas-weigh-less-than-ordinary-cars)

But let's not lose sight here of the HUGE difference between passenger vehicles and trucks.  If you are thinking of road wear, trucks are way harder on roads due to [the fourth power rule](http://thatmansscope.blogspot.com/2009/10/trucks-and-fourth-power-rule.html).

I say that if we are re-jigging road maintenance costs, we should take into account distance travelled, and vehicle weight per axle.  Paying a flat amount per year is just kinda dumb."
