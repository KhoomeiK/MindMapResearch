In this scenario, the dude can be the leader of the room and also be the most social and outgoing guy, but if he behaved like every other horny guy in the party, he wouldn’t have gotten results. In contrast, he could’ve been the sheepiest follower and only talked to one girl, but he would’ve gotten the same awesome results because he didn’t offer himself up like the other dudes.
