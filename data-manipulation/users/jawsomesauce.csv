wow,ffg7sr3,t3_etcmt8,1579900309.0,"but we did that before, the Catacylsm, and it just made people want Classic. So this would make people want Classic Cataclysm for some reason."
startrek,ffdkg5k,t3_esu4k1,1579822772.0,I rewatched Measure of a Man today also because of the Maddox reference. Too bad that Brian Brophy hasn’t acted in 10 years or maybe they’d bring him back in season two.
todayilearned,ffdjdio,t3_esz9xy,1579822115.0,I thought Carrie said in her final book that the hairdressers just tried a ton of different stuff and she picked that one to surprise Lucas who actually liked it. But then again it’s not like Fisher was the best source of info.
chronotrigger,ffdfpc7,t3_et0eke,1579819911.0,Similarly I love the battle style in Earthbound where you can sometimes control who goes first in battle by touching an enemy in the back. It’s just 100x more interesting to see the enemies than the surprise hidden battles from most RPGs.

startrek,ff6c3yo,t1_ff68il5,1579623952.0,Spoiler to me has always just meant revealed before the actual show/game/process. Not necessarily a bad thing.
