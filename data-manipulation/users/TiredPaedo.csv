Asterisks are just for the top row and left column bold formatting by the way as I like to draw the distinction between context and content.

This does make alignment chart memes easier though:

| | **Chaotic** | **Neutral** | **Lawful** |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| **Good** | Chaotic Good | Neutral Good | Lawful Good |  
| **Neutral** | Chaotic Neutral | True Neutral | Lawful Neutral |  
|**Evil** | Chaotic Evil | Neutral Evil | Lawful Evil |

Or the explanation of beliefs (first column deviates from the linguistic base of the others but Hindi is the only language I know of with a word for ""knowledge of nonexistence"")
