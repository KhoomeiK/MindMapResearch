LeopardsAteMyFace,ff7le4x,t1_ff6nzz9,1579652323.0,It’s fucked up that they just print the kids names like that. How is that even legal?
FREE,ff1sd48,t3_er31c0,1579485109.0,You’re great.
WatchandLearn,ff1rfrq,t1_ff1m72x,1579484535.0,The best solution would be for adult mittens to be made like children’s and have that string that runs from one mitten through the sleeves to the other mitten allowing them to just dangle when you take ‘em off.
WatchandLearn,ff1lopx,t1_ff0xpy6,1579481224.0,Treating mittens as a disposable item seems kinda wasteful though.

forwardsfromgrandma,fdyf1q7,t1_fdxlocl,1578779002.0,Good point.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdxh297,t1_fdvycfv,1578768637.0,Would you describe yourself as an orgy guy?
forwardsfromgrandma,fdx7una,t1_fdx4wps,1578766165.0,Your mind immediately goes to justifying killing someone. In most civilized countries that’s just not something people think about. That’s what I mean about the toxic effect on culture. But it’s so ingrained it just seems normal to you.
TikTokCringe,fduesov,t1_fduc6w9,1578732048.0,I can’t do scents so I’m already avoiding perfumes (it’s hard) and can barely stand to wear boxers to bed so pjs are out too. But maybe I can try something a little higher quality than the Aveeno I’m using. Thanks for the tips.
TikTokCringe,fdu7z2e,t1_fdt8i8b,1578729159.0,"Is it possible to moisturize without feeling moist?  That greasy feeling putting on clothes or any time I touch some bare part of me is just gross. And then putting clothes on top of it, yuck. I really only moisturize deep into winter when I’m basically going crazy from itchy, dry skin."
forwardsfromgrandma,fdu6oec,t1_fds2vo0,1578728529.0,"Not really. One would seek to control a women’s body; the other to limit access to weapons. American gun culture is more akin to the edgelord collecting swords and getting angry when you call it a sword and not a katana or something. Like, grow up, it’s not the Wild West or samurai showdown — the obsession with violence and being badass is almost as cringey as it is toxic to society."

Cringetopia,fds818b,t1_fds66gl,1578696452.0,People who say that tend to not know how to support their terrible opinions and just get angry when people tell them they’re wrong.

shittyfoodporn,fdrr3o5,t1_fdr65k5,1578688390.0,I’m looking at pictures and the tofu seems to be holding a shape which is not what I think of when I think of the amorphous glob that is silken tofu.
shittyfoodporn,fdq1mg0,t1_fdq14mn,1578650390.0,Silk tofu is the most disgusting substance known to man. It’s like a mixture of undercooked egg white and precum.

It’s really hard to properly source shit on mobile but if you’re actually interested message me again tomorrow when I’m off work and I’ll go do the dirty work for you when I’ve got access to my PC."
wholesomememes,fclt7g3,t1_fclqyfe,1577755880.0,I remember those fucking faces. I think there was a set of fridge magnets with them on it too.
Conservative,fclstea,t1_fcl43si,1577755607.0,There is evidence for everything you mentioned except maybe the pedophilia (he just associated with a famous one).  Just because you stick your head in the sand doesn’t mean it’s not happening.

Conservative,fcl34rv,t1_fcl2nrh,1577738777.0,"You know both Trump and Biden can be corrupt, right? And you really think a Republican would publicly vote against Trump when his base is essentially a cult of personality?
I think we’ve reached the crux of the problem the world faces today though. There are people that accept expert opinion and those that don’t."
Conservative,fcl20jt,t1_fckxr79,1577738084.0,"Thanks for telling me what I believe and proving my point that all you do is play the victim and  feel like there’s a conspiracy against you. 

From the coverage in international news, a good case was made in the house to prove Trump committed high crimes when he bribed the new president of Ukraine to signup or create dirt on his political opponent In your coming election."
terriblefacebookmemes,fckw0wi,t1_fcjwkg9,1577734407.0,That’s nice.
Conservative,fckvyug,t1_fcjzein,1577734371.0,No I think you have to have a huge victim complex and conspiratorial thinking about “the left” to post here by these responses I’ve gotten.
Conservative,fcjutl8,t1_fcjr4g1,1577705822.0,"No, he said “they” were “politicians” and I’m pretty sure Republicans are politicians so I just followed that absurd idea to its logical conclusion."
terriblefacebookmemes,fcjmrao,t1_fcj75yd,1577694235.0,"First off it makes it sound like he’s suggesting his girlfriend is sleeping around and has to prove the paternity; obviously joking but trashy as fuck to put on social media. 

Second, and likely the reason for the all the pretend bewildered “how’s this trashy?” posts is the stupid gun obsession. A large majority of reddit’s user base finds obsession with guns trashy."
Conservative,fcjm01p,t1_fcjlhl6,1577693217.0,Politicians (Republicans) want the culture to stay reliant on them and then blame republicans (politicians) for their (politicians/republicans) problems.
