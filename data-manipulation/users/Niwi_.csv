interestingasfuck,ffn0hb5,t1_ffmslie,1580060695.0,"It is way too easy.
You just crush some charcoal from coal for grills for example, put them at the bottom and then grab some dirt, sticks, stones or whatever you want out of the water (there are a lot of tiny animals in the dirt) and then you add some water from the lake and put it in there too.
Just put it next to a window so it gets sun
And then you will see algee growing.

If you pick stones with algee on it you will propably be able to close it right away. 
If not you will have to leave it open until you can clearly see some oxygen bubbles on algee.

If you want to scape it like I did that obviously makes it more time consuming, otherwise nature also always does a great job at that :)

And then you just watch.
In winter there will obviously be way less life in the water... im hoping that I will start seeing some more animals in spring.

I think thats all you need to know. Just dump some stuff in a jar and watch it adapt change and evolve. Its great

And the goal is to have no maintainance"

interestingasfuck,ffmo8vb,t1_ffmlewe,1580057227.0,"You mean as a hobby?

Well ecospheres are great
When you think about the cycle thats going on..
You can see the bubbles of oxygen that the plants produce and later you will see how many algee spores you got because it just starts growing everywhere and before you didnt even see it in the water
And then the animals eat them (snail trails on the glass are great)
And they give nutrians to the plants and CO2 but also give out nitrate which noone can use in the ecosphere and is toxic so you need charcoal at the bottom (make sure it cant float up)to filter it out...

Also I love rocket science and space exploration and the way everything around us forms or the engines fly
Or how life formed and almost got extingt 7 times

It should and could be airtight since the plants produce oxygen (the bubbles) and food and the animals CO2. Tho I am not sure how good of a job the lid does. Might not be 100% air tight. Its just a standart screw on.
