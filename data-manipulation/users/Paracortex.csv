I think it’s kinda cool that you seem to really feel this way!  But if you have an indoor cat playing with a toy, it so entertaining to encourage the behavior.  Those little murder mittens can draw blood, though, so it’s not a complete unfounded fear!  But loving cats means accepting a modicum of pain. Not just playing, but kneading, too."

You seem to be arguing that parental responsibility does not exist, even after birth, except by choice.  After all, they can’t force me to use my body to feed, clothe and bathe the child, can they?  Where is my bodily autonomy then?"

Just so you know, there are far more than you think. Only a tiny fraction of those who have such urges and have acted on them are ever caught. The vast majority are already here, in hiding, and I got news for you: they’re not “supporting pedophilia” in discussions, but [quite the opposite](https://dictionary.apa.org/reaction-formation)."

news,fevdcot,t1_fev9re8,1579396074.0,You’re so exactly right.  We also should abhor the growing normalization of vigilanteism. Extrajudicial vengeance should not be applauded and cultivated by anyone who says they care about children’s future.  No conversation can be had in that environment.

Also, **SPOILER ALERT - STOP READING IF YOU HAVEN’T SEEN IT**, it was what spoiled another movie for me because some sloppy reviewer mentioned it when reviewing the sixth sense, so when I watched that movie I noticed all the tells almost from the beginning, and didn’t get to enjoy the surprise. I stopped reading reviews of movies I haven’t seen since then."
