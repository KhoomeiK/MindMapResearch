I’m brand new to all of this, I just got my first printer last week. I’m using an Ender 3 Pro, with yellow springs, Capricorn tubing, an aluminum extruder, and a glass bed.  My bed is pretty warped, with a high spot in the middle, and so a glass bed seemed to make the most sense.  I had some trouble getting adhesion, but I think I just had my nozzle too far away from the bed, and after lots of fiddling, this cube stuck just fine.  In fact, the bottom is super flat and smooth.


It’s a 20mm calibration cube I got from thingiverse, and I’m curious why the sides look different near the bottom quarter of the cube.  I assume it has something to do with my bed temperature. I had it set at 65, which seems high, but I don’t know anything. How do I go about finding my optimal bed temperature?


Honestly, there’s still lots of work left to be done here, but I’m excited. I’m following one of the guides that someone here wrote, but if anyone has any tips or suggestions, I’m all ears.  Like I said, I’m very new and I’m trying to learn as much here as I can.

I didn’t even really want it, I’ve got so many cameras and I don’t shoot 35mm nearly as often as the bigger formats, but it was only ten bucks at a yard sale, so I figured I should probably give it a home.  I had no idea how amazing this little camera is, and I absolutely love it. 


I’ve got hassys, Rollie’s, contax’s, you name it, but I still reach for this little thing more often then any other, because it’s so tiny and light.  The viewfinder is so unobtrusive, it’s barely there, and the whole system weighs nothing.  It’s the most comfortable and enjoyable 35mm slr I’ve ever used. My Canon EOS-3 with L lenses will produce slightly sharper photos, especially opened up, but you can only really tell that difference if you get the negatives properly lab scanned.  Those oly zuiko lenses are sharper than my V800 can resolve, and the colors are fantastic.  The canon system weighs four times as much, is plasticy and electronic, and needs a huge bag to carry, where as the oly is all metal, no battery required, and I can fit the damn thing in my pocket if I really want to. 



You’re going to love this camera, OP, as well as that Domke bag. I’ve been using Domkes for almost thirty years now, and have never looked back.  Every year or two, I throw them all in the washing machine, and then rewax the ones that need it, and they all work just as good as the days they were new.
