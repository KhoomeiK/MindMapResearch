I agree that there are things that you can't do, or are impossible, without the assistance of magic or more--you can't roll high to get blood from a stone. I also agree that standard characters cannot do them without absurd luck--a commoner won't usually know a lot about much of anything.

The exceptions are the player characters. In particular, barbarians, rogues, and fighters are all classes who are capable of performing inhuman, nearly impossible tasks with a bit of luck, and can go even further with the mundane assistance of an artificer.
