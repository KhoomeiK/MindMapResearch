bipolar,fgmurhy,t3_ezc2wv,1580932444.0,"Sorry about the weird change of conversation, and definitely not that I’m doubting you, but are you quite sure it’s lamictal that’s causing this? If you are on a higher dosage, you could ask your psychiatrist to adjust it."
bipolar,fgmt9r1,t3_ezdyqi,1580931599.0,"I didn’t even know I had those side effects (mild) and I blamed it on coffee (I know, Abi + coffee, that combo was a TRIP)

I was closely monitoring my weight gain from taking Abi so I think I just neglected that part of the side effects, but as soon as I noticed 5lbs gain I cut it off. All the symptoms gone."
bipolar,fgmswc0,t3_eze3jr,1580931384.0,"Yup! I do play rogue like campaigns (darkest dungeon, neo scavenger) but that’s because one of them has fairly short campaigns and the other I can just do nothing but wander around the map scavenge things and I can hop off without commitments. My brain can’t take the overly stressful ones or ones that want a lot from me."
bipolar,fgjjo01,t3_eyuydy,1580845434.0,"A couple of blunt things to say but they are just my opinions so maybe take them with a huge grain o’ salt:

1. It’s harmful to try and diagnose someone else if you’re no professional and/or not in a professional setting.

2. Even if you think they’re BP, treat them like you would treat everyone else. BP does not excuse us of anything we do. BP can be the reason behind some of our behaviours BUT it’s by no means justification.

3. If they ghosted you, no matter the reasoning, they’re not ready."
bipolar,fgj8bdv,t3_eys2ih,1580838953.0,Had imposter syndrome going along with it so I was very doubtful when I first got diagnosed. But I was also at the apex of a depressive episode and found it too hard to do anything else about it but to take my meds and follow whatever my psychiatrist told me. It worked.
bipolar,fgj7xpp,t3_eys2q9,1580838729.0,I won’t have children- because I would hate it if I passed my BP to them and my psychiatrist told me that there’s a high chance of passing it on. It was the most awful thing growing up with BP with one of the two parents having BP and it resulted me running away and trying everything to escape when I got into university. Now I’m in my mid 20s I still am certain that I‘m not going back or trying to reconnect with them for my own sanity’s sake. It was too much.
bipolar,fgj79uf,t3_eysat4,1580838337.0,"On Lamictal 200mg for roughly a year. 

I need a LOT of sleep these days & energy level is pretty low, but my mood is under control so I sort of am taking the rough with the smooth. I don’t want to switch my meds at this point since Lamictal is working for me (of course sometimes manic and/or depression episode kicks in, but neither goes to distance and they are always manageable.)

I also kinda blame it on winter & the sudden temperature drop where I live. So there’s also that...?"
bipolar,fgj5wg7,t3_eytee8,1580837573.0,Talk to your psychiatrist about this! If it’s getting out of hand maybe it’s not the best type of meds for you.
bipolar,fgj5pvh,t3_eyt9zh,1580837476.0,Especially like the two on the floor. They are beautiful!
Dreams,ff4n0rt,t1_ff4msq5,1579567569.0,"Nope, that’s what’s funny too, I never dreamt about anything substantially religious at all either, so this one kinda weirded me out."

My name is Desmond, you can associate me with Celtic arrows and the moor."
CasualConversation,fe6qjyb,t3_eo0hgx,1578900723.0,For a time people thought my brother was gay because they knew that I am. Which made -10 sense. People just have weird logic sometimes.

Fuck yes"
CasualConversation,fe0kz9l,t1_fe0kqq2,1578815284.0,"That sounds amazing. I can’t even roll up my blinds without getting light pollution in my eyes the whole night. It’s loud out, bright out, dangerous out.

I wonder what it feels like. Do you take walks like this often?"
CasualConversation,fe0jzil,t3_enkhkh,1578814703.0,"Living in a patrolled but super unsafe area so can’t go out after sundown, otherwise gunpoint robbery happens (downtown metrop)

But what I would do to be able to wander around at night, I can only imagine!"

assholedesign,fdzibxc,t3_engact,1578790509.0,Ohhhhh I got the same thing a month ago! Scary that they should have so many people’s info like this tbh.
interestingasfuck,fdvwvz9,t1_fdvwf9a,1578752605.0,Oh no why would the dogs be exposed to those aggressive animals!? Just curious bc I have no idea about dog keeping at all
interestingasfuck,fdvjufd,t1_fdviz1n,1578748146.0,Oh man I don’t even want to know why. Humans sometimes are bad animals.
interestingasfuck,fdvg7j4,t1_fdvbvnw,1578747122.0,Oh no! Surely that’s not normal :O???

interestingasfuck,fdufa01,t1_fduedjr,1578732252.0,Mystery solved! Thanks for the pic!
interestingasfuck,fdu4axh,t1_fdu3wis,1578727287.0,"I’ve seen some dogs with red eyes and sometimes those are accompanied with tear like translucent goo around, I’ve never thought about allergies, that certainly opens a new line of thought. Thanks!"

interestingasfuck,fdu3fpa,t1_fdu3cop,1578726838.0,"Oh I see, thanks!"
interestingasfuck,fdu36wc,t3_en4c7n,1578726716.0,Silly question maybe (never been a dog owner and all!) is it normal for them to have red/pink eyes like this?

CasualConversation,fdtm9ld,t3_en31e4,1578718808.0,"How’s the air up there? /jk

Honestly I wish I could say the same but I’m not so young anymore, confused and scared around successful and authoritative people because of crappy childhood. 

Speaking of those people- How did you deal with being around them? How did you deal with taking orders from them and not be timid around them?"
CasualConversation,fdnzw5p,t1_fdnzhrb,1578596239.0,That’s what I got from the billboards and posters etc too. It weirded me out that they had thought it was necessary for something like that to have had about 70000 ads put out. Not going to put on my tin foil hat just yet but tbh it’s kinda weird.
CasualConversation,fdnz5cc,t1_fdnyo28,1578595803.0,"Had me in the first half, but I was curious also. What was it even about?"
CasualConversation,fdmlw6u,t3_em6bng,1578554917.0,"Amen to that. People for some reason always assume I’m straight right off the bat so when someone goes blind and decides to make a move towards my general direction I get so embarrassed and it just feels so awkward.

Purely from my experience, if nobody is hitting on you then there’s pretty much no way to explain to them except faking crushes."
