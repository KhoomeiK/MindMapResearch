AppleMusic,ffzuuq5,t1_ffzq6fn,1580393497.0,"So I post on r/apphookup a lot (check my post history too). It’s 100% not bots. People are very active on that sub and are on the lookout for deals. On that thread, people who missed the codes baselessly claimed that bots took the codes and that got traction sadly.

Edit: please please don’t turn your back on apphookup.net based code distribution. It has been tried and tested and is pretty effective against botting."
AppHookup,ffzukf7,t3_ew5xg3,1580393280.0,This is not a deal. They moved to a subscription model.
