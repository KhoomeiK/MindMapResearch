unpopularopinion,fgjzjm3,t3_eyta1t,1580854468.0,It’s the worst form of social media I’ve ever seen
ENFP,fgjzha0,t1_fgjy6fz,1580854432.0,"Yeah I’m sorry that really sucks man. If there were times you genuinely needed him and he was aware of it and wasn’t there for you I’m not gonna make excuses for him. I will say that’s not something I’ve noticed to be an ENFP thing that might just be a him thing. Friends should be there for friends regardless of their personality type. Maybe make sure you’re as important to him as he is to you, because one sided friendships suck."
unpopularopinion,fgj9711,t3_eyn3ft,1580839468.0,"This. This is the kind of opinion I came here for. Not the politics of weed, not controversial opinions about race or gender. This. This is what I wanted from this subreddit"
ENFP,fgj1ij3,t1_fgiuho3,1580835198.0,The fact that they want full fledged conversations when they come back is proof you’re their friend and they want to talk to you. If you can’t accept the concept that people need to be alone sometimes then there’s not a lot I can tell you.
unpopularopinion,fgiry0e,t3_eyosnd,1580829570.0,The people who can change the world are the people who believe they can. Everyone is special in their own way.
ENFP,fgir9jk,t3_eyl6o8,1580829127.0,Sometimes they just need alone time. Or time to hang out with other people. You shouldn’t take that as a personal attack
unpopularopinion,fghwzqq,t3_eydl9w,1580796487.0,It might not be “controlling” but it’s pretty lame
unpopularopinion,fghw78z,t3_ey981l,1580795743.0,I always like movies more if they have sone sort of love story imbedded in it
BatmanArkham,fghvwp7,t3_eyga4m,1580795470.0,He was a little too iron man-y for me. The city/asylum suit is my favorite because it makes you focus more on what the man is capable of as opposed to what the suit is capable of.
unpopularopinion,fghv5oh,t3_ey62dg,1580794803.0,"I have sympathy for people who are sad about being single. It really sucks sometimes. I don’t think it’s an excuse to sit around doing nothing all day, but everyone has different priorities and if you’re someone that really values relationships being single is difficult."
blursedimages,fg5yp54,t3_ewvtj0,1580544751.0,Oh that’s real depressing
BatmanArkham,fg5yn1m,t3_ewud7w,1580544672.0,Fuck I almost forget how beautiful this game is sometimes
ENFP,fg09z9c,t1_fg0379l,1580403389.0,Well everyone feels emotions it’s more the extent to which you feel them. People with the T personality type still have feelings. But I get it’s hard to articulate
BatmanArkham,fg09u1q,t1_fg06rk2,1580403302.0,"It’s totally okay to have problems with things it just seems odd to me that there’s such a large number of people that have such a problem with joker being featured in the games, yet they all still cling to the franchise so aggressively. Why would you say you love something if you hate what the central idea of that thing."
BatmanArkham,fg06h0w,t1_ffzrhgx,1580401262.0,"Well at the core of the Arkham games is Batman’s relationship with the joker, so either you can accept that and enjoy the franchise for what it is or you can find another game"
unpopularopinion,fg06b0h,t1_ffz9vhg,1580401160.0,I totally agree but as you just said there is still a white and black culture even if there are people that grew up in the other culture.

ENFP,ffz9n3u,t3_evtxg2,1580368566.0,Well if you don’t get emotional are you sure you’re an ENFP not an ENTP or an INFP?
unpopularopinion,ffz99el,t1_ffz90wc,1580368102.0,Well quite honestly black people and white people tend grow up in different circumstances. You can’t pretend that’s not true. It might not be great but it is a reality. There’s nothing wrong with enjoying the different viewpoints their respective lifestyles generate. Nobody is saying one is better or worse than the other.
unpopularopinion,ffz8pvd,t3_evqf3v,1580367488.0,You can appreciate different cultural viewpoints in their own right without being racist.
BatmanArkham,ffyjg56,t1_ffyj4h7,1580347874.0,Okay well in both cases they didn’t want to spoil it so I can see what you’re saying but I can also see why they didn’t advertise joker.
BatmanArkham,ffyguzw,t3_evtue1,1580346113.0,Everyone who bitches about it clearly doesn’t get the narrative the Arkham games were going for
unpopularopinion,ffy5ad1,t3_ettggd,1580338816.0,Gonna be real I kind of agree
me_irl,ffxwh18,t3_evpjae,1580333783.0,Yeah I’m downvoting them because I’m sick of seeing this stale ass meme all over my feed
BatmanArkham,ffxasvu,t1_ffxapj8,1580321333.0,Oh totally agree 100%
BatmanArkham,ffx9s9x,t1_ffx9cs5,1580320720.0,I’m one of them. She’s an objectively better character when she’s with him.

aww,ffhhj5e,t3_etib79,1579935508.0,...
BatmanMemes,fffydkw,t1_fffy8u4,1579894501.0,Yeah I agree
BatmanMemes,ffftxlv,t1_ffftj95,1579891722.0,"I can enjoy stories when she’s on her own but still in a relationship with joker, like in the animated series. But the second she broke up with him she became tacky and unbearable to me. Don’t get me wrong I’m all for female empowerment, especially in comics where it’s needed, but that’s what Catwoman and poison ivy are for. Not EVERY female character needs to be a cheesy girl power solo act."
BatmanMemes,fffezl6,t1_ffenwxw,1579882515.0,I think she’s a much better character with joker. Showcasing an abusive relationship was so real and psychologically compelling. No comic had ever done anything like it before.
BatmanArkham,fffeqgb,t1_fff7eo9,1579882354.0,So do a lot of people. I stand by it
BatmanArkham,ffelf3g,t3_et5feq,1579853021.0,I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Harley Quinn is only a good character when she’s with joker. It strengthens both of their characters and gives them more depth.
