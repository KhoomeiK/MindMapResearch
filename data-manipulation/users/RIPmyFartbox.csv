pelotoncycle,ff6prsr,t3_ert4hq,1579632331.0,"Been doing peloton for around 10 days.  One  pet peeve of mine is when instructors call out user screen names over and over.  I kinda wish they'd just teach the class instead of calling out mike2435 from Texas or KateSpins44 from Florida, or whatever. I understand the occasional shout out but some instructors are doing that way too much and takes away from the overall workout by calling out user screen names for what seems like 25pct of the entire time they're talking.  Any instructors that do this less than others?

Also looking for beat based instructors (like soul cycle) if anyone can recommend favorites.  Thanks"

barstoolsports,fekkh2w,t1_fek7ve2,1579201929.0,"Used to wait tables growing up and there was this waitress that would always do this.  She'd fudge 3s to look like 8s, etc.  Thing is, she'd only do it if the customer left both copies of the receipt so she could never get caught.  Always take your copy of the receipt (or I guess now with cell phones you can just take a picture but back then there was no such thing)."
