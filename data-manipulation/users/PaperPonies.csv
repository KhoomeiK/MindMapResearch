Homesteading,fesl738,t3_eqeocm,1579366378.0,"Well, here's one of mine: I live right across the road from a large cemetery, there are often burials/graveside funeral services. My fence is hardly 50-75 feet from where the cemetery begins. 

I have a standard donkey, Sully, who is very people oriented. He loves to be pet, played with, and gets incredibly jealous if attention isn't on him at all times. I also have a horse with a very similar personality, Ax, so it's always a little competition between them on who gets attention - to the point where if I'm handling one I have to tie the other just to stay out from under us. Even though they bicker, they're very attached to one another. 

So, typically when there's a graveside funeral I gather the horses/goats and put them all in the pen behind the house, out of sight. This is partly so they don't gather at the fence line to watch the service and partly so people don't go pet my horses afterwards because one of them bites (people approach them all the time!). 

Anyway, on to the embarrassing part. This one particular day I got home from work & saw that a graveside funeral was going on right along the road area. Two of my horses and all the goats were by the house munching hay, but Sully and Ax were attending this funeral and boy could they not stand not being included, their chests were practically touching the fence. 

So, I went outside and stood by the other horses hoping they'd see me and come down the hill to the pen (about 100 yards of open land). Ax sees me and of course neighs and trots down the hill. It was a little embarrassing that he neighed but no big deal. I put him in the pen with the others and expected Sully, the donkey, to come as well but he didn't. 

This is where it got *really* embarrassing. Sully, having spotted me ""giving Ax attention"" and having been abandoned by Ax, decided to start crying-- by braying LOUDLY right in front of this poor group of people in the middle of the service. Ax subsequently neighed with the decibels of a freight train horn. I expected Sully to come down the hill but he had no such plans. He decided braying as ferociously as his little lungs could would be his best option. This is where I started cringing. 

Ax then freaked out that Sully wasn't coming, so he neighed once more and of course Sully brayed/whined in response. I almost died right then and there of embarrassment. Ax wouldn't go back up the hill and Sully wouldn't leave the funeral and come down so they were just screaming at each other a football field's length apart. 

I decided to go get Sully even though it was super mortifying to walk up on these people's funeral service; I grabbed a halter & lead and marched up the hill. As I was coming over the biggest terrace, Sully brayed *at me* and I just wanted to crawl in a hole, except I heard people laughing, like deep belly laughing. I was probably 100ft away from the funeral and they were mostly turned away, but people kept turning around to look at us and they were definitely losing it, laughing or laugh-crying, I couldn't tell. 

I haltered Sully and dragged his ass down the hill as quickly as I could. I hope to everything that the funeral attendees weren't upset by the braying/neighing of their extra funeral guest. So glad they were laughing and not angry in the moment, that's a good sign at least. 

The cemetery committee texts me when there is going to be a service now, per my request."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fe32bni,t1_fe2ad8h,1578845235.0,"I'm not sure why someone said ""old mind set"" but there is extreme rural poverty in most areas of Alabama and Mississippi. I grew up there, went to school there, and was fortunate/privileged to attend a highly accredited school system. However, in my experience, the more rural/poor you are the worse the schools become. There is next to no funding. 

I grew up with kids who were forced to go to woefully behind, lacking schools simply because they weren't in the city limits of a desired school and couldn't afford to pay tuition. They and their parents would have killed to go to my school and to have a better education. It bothers me that anyone would say they didn't want to learn because they were *stuck in their ways*.

wholesomememes,fdiiotj,t3_eljasn,1578443792.0,"When my older brother was still in highschool he had three friends who unfortunately became unwelcome in their own homes. Three boys from different families had nowhere to go or felt uncomfortable at home. It was unbelievable. 

My parents let them all move in with us at the farm, one by one. They were able to set up beds upstairs and had their own rooms. It felt so good having the house full. I felt so special when they'd all rave and compliment the dinners I'd cook for everyone. It was like having extra brothers. They ate a ton, I felt like an army cook! Anyway,

One night one of them told us that he couldn't believe how my family talked to one another, that we didn't yell or argue. I completely took that for granted, it had never even occurred to me. At one point another said he could finally breathe at our house. 

I'll never forget when the oldest of the three told my mother, ""You're like another mom to me."" She said he could call her mom if he wanted and he just burst into tears. This big tough teenager just wanted a hug from my mom. 

In the time they stayed, these ""throwaway"", angry, hurt, rejected boys were able to just relax. My mom got them all to graduate (two were wanting to drop out), she helped them with resumes, job hunting, taxes, car troubles... She somehow got them off drugs so they could get jobs. But she didn't do it with anger or force, she supported them and **helped** instead of reprimanded. It was incredible to see them all transform. 

It was a great time in my life, I loved having such a big family and that experience is why I've decided to become a foster parent in the future. 

Not sure why I typed all this out but I can't wait to be that person in someone's life and I really hope others open their hearts and homes to those who don't have one or don't feel welcome in their own because you can absolutely make a difference in someone's life."

But even I hate reselling individually because taking individual photos, creating listings, packaging, labelling, and shipping takes a lot of time. 

How many models are we talking? I'd be happy to look at photos of them for appraisal and even help you cherry pick the select high end models to auction if there are any of significant value. 

I'd be happy to set you up or post on your behalf on hobby forums/sales pages looking for someone in your area to take the entire lot so you aren't left selling one by one. Depending where you are and what price you're okay accepting, we can likely get them sold in a reasonable amount of time. If you have a good era of horses they'll be gone in a snap. 

However, I will preface that sometimes, even horses in good condition, aren't worth as much as the original collector thinks, especially models from the late 80s-early00s. They expect a regular run to be worth $100 because it's been taken care of and get upset when I tell them it has a $35 market value, but I know the hobby and will appraise what I know the horse can sell for based on run, condition, and collectability.
