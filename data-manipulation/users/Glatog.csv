AskWomenOver30,ff7o6eh,t3_es1n6i,1579654260.0,"Yup. Sometimes I just need to let it all out. I need a cathartic release. Might not have anything major happening, but just little things that if left unaddressed will cause me to feel overwhelmed. I realized this was my mind's way of releasing the pressure valve. Now when I feel it coming I grab the chocolate and curl up under the blankets. I've learned I feel much better after."
AskReddit,fezldo7,t3_eqwb4n,1579458595.0,Hopefully none.
AskReddit,fezkan4,t3_eqvh0p,1579458243.0,Really really terrible. Nothing like being lonely when you aren't alone. Being with someone that is so detached really hurts.
JUSTNOFAMILY,feuegd4,t3_eqbhgw,1579385747.0,"I'm really relieved to see your edit. I think you need support. Don't completely hide from 1-5. Trying to do this your way all along has led you to where you are. You can tell them what steps you are taking, open your heart to them without involving them in the drama. 

Maybe sending an email to the group, after working with a therapist for a bit, is a good first step. In it you can admit your mistakes, ask them for forgiveness, and let them know you may need understanding and support as you try to change your world. At no point do you ask them to step in, intercede on your behalf. You don't need to tell them how 6 is reacting. Just that you are working to enforce boundaries. 

Please come back again and let us know how you are doing. If you want to dm me and chat, I'm happy to lend an ear."

orlando,fednohv,t1_fed81dw,1579015918.0,"Definitely check it out then because I'm the same way. They have clothes by type, then size, then color. I can literally go to the large blouses and look for a green top and see the entire selection in just a couple minutes. I can skip entire color sections i don't like. Sometimes people mix up the sizes, but it isn't that bad. I can pick a cart full of stuff, try it all on, leave with a dozen items and I've only spent an hour in the store."
orlando,fed7sab,t3_eoecht,1579002820.0,"I really like OMG in Casselberry. I like the way the clothes are laid out, makes it easy to find something in my size. I don't have to hunt."
AskReddit,fed7nw2,t3_eoemhc,1579002675.0,"I've been involved with two men who qualify. Neither told me ahead of time. One I was perfectly fine with. The other made me giggle. The difference is prior to clothes coming off, the second one talked it up and kept using the word big to describe it. Had he not tried to over compensate our situation would have been different. 

Was actually involved with the first one for a while. Still think of him from time to time. He had so many wonderful things about him, the size didn't even phase me."
tumblr,febkdr1,t3_eo2ota,1578959695.0,I always think if they lived inside my head for a day they would hate me so i can't be that nice of a person.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fe5tp8l,t3_enq8t2,1578874716.0,I accidentally said grandpa once and my dog stared at the door for two hours. She pouted terribly until he came to visit. The guilt trip i got that night was epic. I no longer say grandpa unless i know he is nearby. It's been five years and I'm still scarred from that!
AskFeminists,fe38esx,t3_enoiz2,1578846905.0,"Your lack of empathy for someone that has had a miscarriage makes me think you are still a bit too immature to go into medicine. Do you have that same reaction if someone dies in a car accident? I mean they made the choice to get into a car. Do you lack empathy for someone that had a heart attack because it could have been caused by their lifestyle choices? Do you lack empathy equally for all humans or just women that have tried to get pregnant? It sounds like you need to really look into the root of this. 


As someone that has had four miscarriages and is unable to have children I am clearly taken aback by your comments. Have you ever actually talked to someone that has suffered through this? Do you have any concept of how much parents love their children the moment they find out they are expecting? Love doesn't start when you meet a child in a conventional sense. Love starts when you start trying. Love starts when you feel the changes in your body. Love starts when you see the heartbeat. I may not have met my children, but i truly loved each of them. 


Let's look at a completely non related concept. The final Star Wars film just came out. Did you anticipate seeing it? Were you excited to see the conclusion of the story? Did you see commercials for it that got you more excited? That build up and anticipation if you are a fan is part of the excitement. Even if you know ahead of time you may not like all parts of the film. And if just before opening weekend it's decided the film is never going to be released you'd be disappointed and irritated. Multiply that by a million and add in physical trauma and this will give you a very small idea of the heartbreak of miscarriage."

BariatricSurgery,fde9k0i,t3_eku09g,1578334171.0,"My original pcp was on board, super supportive and actually recommended it. I ended up having to move to a new state prior to surgery. New dr was a giant ass for many reasons. One of which was that he wouldn't discuss wls as an option. I had the surgery anyway as intended and found a better fit for my pcp. 

You need someone who will listen to you and support you. Not necessarily do what you want but they have to be willing to discuss pros and cons of every option. I think you should evaluate if this pcp is really meeting all of your needs."
AskFeminists,fddfz0h,t1_fdczyru,1578310566.0,This paragraph would have been fine had you left the last line off. It's almost like you had to prove that people were right about your tone being antagonistic.
AskFeminists,fd2jz9m,t1_fd01z4k,1578148319.0,"I do like that a man didn't actually need to rescue them. I think that was the important part for many. Compared to Brave, the girls were able to be their own heroes so that was a nice chance of peace. Hopefully, this is the beginning of strong women characters directed toward young girls. 

I just thought it was a bad movie. Hated a lot of the dialogue and songs."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fd2bkqr,t3_ejtg7v,1578144818.0,"His anger toward you has nothing to do with you. You are his scapegoat. He needs somewhere to direct his hurt because he can't process it. And since you don't obey, you are the perfect lightening rod. 

The visa process sucks, but as soon as you can extricate  yourself from this situation the better. Protect yourself and your partner."
getdisciplined,fd2ajyx,t3_ejsntn,1578144305.0,"I never drank coffee, but i used to drink loads of mountain dew. A 2 liter bottle a day was nothing. I realized the sugar and caffeine was just too much.  Quit all caffeine. That was over 20 years ago. I rarely feel groggy in the mornings. I never need something to get me going. 

I've since tried caffeine a few times accidentally and once on purpose. My heart raced and i broke out in a cold sweat. My body literally can't handle it at all now."

Healthyhooha,fcy82l1,t3_ejhv41,1578076108.0,Lots of deep breaths. Ask questions along the way. It will be weird. But the weirdness is only for a few moments. I play on my phone as a distraction until the dr comes in. That way i have something else to focus on. Cute cat and dog videos are always good.
orlando,fcwtq5a,t1_fcw1bsr,1578037234.0,As long as you are honest about it you should be fine. If asked then you say it is the mailing address you are using while you set up residency. But at least you get your chance to sell your skills. I didn't get many responses until i had a local address.
orlando,fcvwu1l,t3_ej1jus,1578011903.0,An out of state address is a red flag down here. Either take the address off or see if you can get a po box in the area you plan to live.
BariatricSurgery,fcv2zka,t3_ej11xv,1577993580.0,As soon as i realized i looked like an idiot in oversized clothes i hit the thrift stores.  I should have gone sooner. Get a few traditional pieces and just make a monthly trip to the thrift store.

rescuecats,fciiuf6,t3_eh8ukx,1577663270.0,"It could be stress too. I took a cat out of a hoarding situation. She was stressed and underweight when i got her. There was plenty of food available there, but she didn't like living with 35 other cats in a small space. Her coat even filled out once she came to my house. 

It took her a while to adjust to my household. I have several animals since i rescue cats, just not to hoarder status."
JUSTNOFAMILY,fch2a3i,t3_eh98lp,1577646608.0,"This is one where i would say both ladies are in the wrong. Don't ever bring something to a communal dinner if you aren't willing to share. That's just bad etiquette. 

Her temper tantrum was way over the top. I'm guessing these are established patterns in the family. When everyone is calm, maybe it can be discussed. But you have to own your side of it. If you don't admit what you did was rude, you can't expect her to admit it either. 

Discuss better ways to handle conflict. Your exploding into violence and hurting yourself tells me you have issues you need to work on. Focus on what you can do to be better and you can hope your sister follows suit. Have that be your focus. 

These family patterns are hard to break. But it can be done. Be honest with yourself. Examine your motives and how you react. Focus on changing yourself first. You can break the cycle."

Foodforthought,fc05tkz,t1_fc01nof,1577279888.0,"Um.... McDonald's is supposed to be consumed immediately. You don't expect food to last multiple seasons when you buy it so not exactly a fair comparison.  And TVs, cars, and electronics are still getting used for multiple years by most people.

Fast fashion is trying to reduce the amount of time you can wear clothes before they fall apart. I expect to buy clothes and own them for multiple seasons before donating to the next person."
