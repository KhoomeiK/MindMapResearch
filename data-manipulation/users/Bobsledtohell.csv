I have seen a lot of posts about how violent and nasty Islam is but very rarely do I see anything about how violent and nasty the Bible is. I see a lot of posts about how Mohammed was a pedophile but have rarely or never seen anything about how God encouraged incest or how God impregnated a young girl (Mary was probably only 12 years old) who was engaged to someone else...without her knowing and without her fiance knowing. Technically rape.

I have seen that many people are quick to label Islam as barbaric, misogynistic and violent, but dont have the same criticism of the Bible, which is strange considering that:

1. God got mad at women turning gold into dildos 
2. If a woman touches another mans genitals then she should have her hand cut off
3.  The bible says that the men of Egypt had donkey-sized dicks and they ejaculated like a horse 
4. David had to pay the bride price of 100 Philistine foreskins in order to marry King Sauls daughter
5. Raping old men was not as bad as offering your two virgin daughters to any angry mob to rape
6. Drugging and sleeping with your father was fine
7.  When a woman has a discharge is menstruating she is impure and whoever  touches her shall be unclean until evening and everything she  lies or sits on is unclean. 
8. God demanded that Josiah kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has  known man intimately.
9. You can own slaves and pass them onto your kids, but only if they are foreigners
10. If you constantly don't obey your father, the city Elders should stone you to death
11.  If you are deformed in any way (mentally or physically handicapped) then you cant ever get to Heaven
12. A woman was considered as the property of a man, along with slaves and animals and could be made to marry her rapist
13. Women should keep quiet and let the man do all the talking and be submissive to her husband
14. God tell Saul to totally destroy a land.. utterly destroy all that they have, and kill both man and woman, infant and  nursing child, ox and sheep, camel and donkey. When he did not do this God destroyed him

I think that your view is far too limited in timeframe. If it wasnt for changes in culture across time, then UK would be a very different place. Its language has influence from Norse, French, Latin and Arabic for a start. You would not have spices from the east, nor the Church of England. Things in UK like printing, architecture, areas of higher learning such as maths and medicine, ballet, classical music and almost every other thing has borrowed from other cultures. Culture is a dynamic thing, not stagnant and it is from borrowing or being influenced by other cultures, that your own stays healthy and vibrant. Did you know that UK benefited hugely from Arabic medicine and for 100s of years, the Arabic texts were far superior and used widely across Europe. Or that UK high speed trains depend on French technology and know-how. Or that the current UK Royal Family is a mix of English and Greek heritage?
In fact I dont think that you could name a single thing that was not influenced by other cultures. 
Absolutely whites are allowed to preserve their culture.
But heres the funny thing. In years gone by, whites invaded/colonised/moved into non-white civilisations and took away as much as they could (ever been to a museum)? So they raped a culture that wasnt their own and tried to instill their own and nobody was talking about immigration caps then were they? But now that people from many of these places want to come to UK, then its all about maintaining your own culture."

A similar thing happened in my family. One brother was disowned. My mother died and left his share to his children. My dad died and specifically excluded him (he was a stepfather and not a direct relation). I and one brother were named as Executors, but after my brothers wife got involved and started making arrangements about assets to be sold etc, I told my brother to ask her to stop, since if anything went wrong, then as Executors, we were legally liable. My brother and his wife and their kids then got nasty. Really nasty! It was so acrimonious that  I finally realised that the reason my ostracised brother was cut off, was due mainly to the Executor brother working to badmouth him to my parents. Cut a long story short, my Executor brother fought my entitlement all the way and also the other brother. Even his kids (grandkids) started getting grabby, even though they got about 100K each.

He made his own life hell and then he lost. My ostracised brother got almost as much as we did. Now no-one in the family ever talks to each other.

Personally, I would talk to your brother. Make it clear to your wife that you are in charge and while you value her opinion, you want to try and undo some wrongs. If you are only 2 brothers then your brother may be awarded 50% if it goes to court. He then may be awarded his costs. Add to that, your own legal costs need to come out of the Estate. Since lawyers will smell money, they will be in no hurry to help you to settle through negotiation. So count on losing a least a few 100K from them alone.

I have just checked a US website and this may help, but trust me, try and get your brother on side and settle for a bit less than 50%. My ostracised brother had not spoken to either parent for over 10-15 years, but he still succeeded.

Good luck walking the tightrope that this is going to be and I hope you have better success as a family than I did

oh, I just thought of something else. Put every effort in writing and watch what you say or do. Judges look very poorly on an Executor who acts in bad faith or does nasty things. I am not talking about nasty like calling your brother an asshole, the sort of nasty they look for is hiding money or assets, refusing to entertain any claim, transferring stuff to your wife etc."

He said that, whilever I think that one thing leads to another, it usually will. He told me never to look at the fucking clock and to stop watching for signs. I did both and while I still get depression, its not the soul-crunching agony that makes me want to end it all.

..by some nonce who has a degree? Really? Psychology still needs to escape the ""crystals and mood essence"" stage of its evolution and its fight for scientific relevance has made it make some pretty outstanding mistakes in its classification of mental disorders.

You don't have to pretend to be anything, but you still can be humble and recognise that the world doesnt turn on your opinion. The best mindsI have ever met, always retained a healthy dose of humility.

And if you want to compare dick size (although you probably dont have one). I am a neuroscientist with more degrees than really necessary and have worked in 3 of the worlds most famous scientific research institutes, alongside Nobel laureates. So exactly why I should be intimidated by someone who may know a lot about a field of endeavour that has very little material scientific basis, is a bit puzzling.
