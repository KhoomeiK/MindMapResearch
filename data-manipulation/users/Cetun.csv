The warheads would be released from the nose of the missile outside of the atmosphere and would have the same range as the missile (while it wouldn't experience drag it wouldn't have enough speed to obtain orbit, gravity thrusters would pull it to earth) continue to their targets independently. With GPS guidance each warhead can hit within 90m of any specific target. With astrological guidance less than 200 meters. When your aiming for an entire city both those distances are tiny and would constitute a perfect hit. You could have them all hit one city in a pattern that would cause as much destruction as possible, or on specific targets like one over a rail yard, one over a government building, one over an important bridge etc. to cause more strategic damage. Now that's speculation as specific targeting data is obviously a tightly held secret and specific targets would be in prearranged attack plans that would be uploaded to the missile and warheads right before launch."

I know a lot of people that did H and Meth and I can say that 4/10 ended up fucked up bad 

Another 4/10 continuously have problems but on the outside you would never know it, they hold down a job, they maintain a rocky but long relationships, some have episodes of destructive behavior but mostly they just operate on the level of a typical high school educated 20 year old no matter what their age, so that means they are like 38 and still wash dishes or work retail but they can pay their bills by themselves or pay their bills with the help of their parents, they have worked the same job for years, and generally stay out of trouble with the police as much as any 20 year old does. 

The last 2/10 when they were young experimented or got hard into H and Meth and really developed an addiction, it controlled their lives for a couple months to a couple of years but eventually through whatever means, child birth, rehab, intervention, near death experience, watching a friend OD, whatever it was basically reset them. They are normal people now, I've been told they still have the urge but its controllable and not a problem unless there is something super stressful happening. They go on to college or have a family and live normal lives as contributing members of society. Though one thing i did notice is they turned to drugs mostly as a crutch for some deeper psychological problems and after they recover from drugs the psychological problems seem to be somewhat worse but they have more coping skills (either from tactics learned in rehab or having family or work to focus on).

Generally the more self control you have the better your chances are, but I wouldn't do it. I've never done meth so I cant say how much it grabs you, or how much willpower it takes to kick it, but the best way to never get addicted to it is to never do it in the first place."

WorldofTanks,ff6r4u2,t3_eruv54,1579633139.0,"I have the entire Panther line that I play regularly, I would say the whole line is somewhat underpowered and slow, obviously not as slow as other thanks but for how weak it is in other factors it's slow. The Italian line I personally think is better, or the Leo line, even the STB line, all three are paper armor but I feel they are faster and still reasonably accurate. The Panther line up to the E50 might as well not have armor, the P44 is much better. You can use the E50 as a sniper, but the Leo does that way better an has more mobility, you want armor but your turret can be penned on its face so it's not like you'll be able to brawl especially if they are slinging gold, might as well red line snipe with a leo. The STB line is meh until the STB then it's meta because of its depression and bouncy turret face."

Either get your equipment right or you're cosplaying, how much you want to bet that helmet is just a glorified bicycle helmet?"

That is they want to none young women but don't have the looks or personality so they try to make the financial and stability reason the biggest factor in sexual selection, and guess what, old white men that make laws happen to have the wealth and income to support a family."
