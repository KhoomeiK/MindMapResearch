Assuming a £4000 deposit and £1000 bonus (=£5000 capital), and you choose to withdraw the total balance as OP wants to do, the penalty of 25% of the balance is £1250 - so OP would only withdraw £3750 in total, so £250 worse off."

But primarily how will you specifically get a mortgage? The bank of mum and dad is not an income line, it's a guarantor line but even then they'd be as well taking the mortgage out themselves and get a better rate."

UKPersonalFinance,fedxv4u,t1_fedfq75,1579022189.0,"Your question is loaded because you're asking to predict the market. In reality if you invested in a S&S ISA product on Wednesday and the world economy went to shit on Thursday, you've lost money. Now it's unrealistic that it'll happen, but it could, and if you are investing in S&S in any form you need to be okay with the concept that you may actually lose money, both short and long term. 

HSBC is just one platform offering these ISAs, you can look at places such as Hargreaves Lansdown, AJ Bell, Vanguard, iWeb etc. that all offer different rates dependent on the product you want to invest in."
UKPersonalFinance,fe92aqg,t3_eo59zi,1578933366.0,"Painting with a broad brush but for many people using StepChange, it is because they simply lacked the discipline to actually deal with their debts in the first place. Hence a personal plan just wouldn't actually be practicable to them.

And fundamentally you can always contact StepChange to confirm your personal debt management plan is sensible using their expert advice service, without actually entering into a StepChange-managed plan. I'm not sure why, if I believed I had the discipline to roll my own DMP, I wouldn't contact them anyway to sense check it."

AmItheAsshole,fcaztos,t3_egyuco,1577579869.0,"People change, friends you had a year ago may not be true friends today, and cutting them out from your life is a totally acceptable part of growing up and older. It's likely that even if you say to them not to talk about that sort of stuff when you're around, that they'll continue to talk about that sort of stuff when you're not, and ultimately you need to ask yourself if you want that sort of negativity/toxicity in your life currently.
