IncelExit,fc48hmx,t1_fc3y48l,1577409479.0,"yes of course you can see an escort , the problem lies in the fact that you might expect too much from an escort and be disappointed , all life is about managing expectations .

you said that you are not content of living ""this way"" , what do you mean exactly ? i already know the answer so don't worry , it just that we make life too hard for ourselves . i don't expect you to understand me nor do i expect to understand you .

you also said that life is pointless , i totally agree , that makes it so that you CHOOSE THE POINT OF YOUR LIFE , of course choosing that it is pointless and not worth living is also an option , but please if you ever choose that route , dont die in defeat , dont die scared , dont die as a ""loser"" but die with your head held high , with a smile , be at peace with it , it is , in my eyes a totally respectable choice , but still , i wish you give life and yourself more chances , i am not saying that it will get better , in fact it might get worse , the barrel has no bottom (firsthand experience ;). just my opinions though"
IncelExit,fc3xo4e,t3_eg2393,1577401287.0,"i will say something that will sound extremely strange , life turns around reproduction but your life doesn't have to be , of course being a volcel is much different than being an incel , but you gotta deal with the cards that life has given you 

let me be personal with you , i am older than you ,  uneducated and jobless , penniless , dependant on my parents (god bless them)and comparatively in  a much worse situation than you , yes i too considered roping many times but with time , i no longer feel sad about all the things i don't have and feel content with the life i have , although i live in the bottom 5% i think i am as content as the top 5% , it took me many years to reach this state and i am still on the journey , please message me if you need any help"
