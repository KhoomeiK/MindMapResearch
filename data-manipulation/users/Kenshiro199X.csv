strength_training,ff9kcui,t3_esas4h,1579714839.0,Drop the weight to where you feel confident getting some depth. I suggest using goblet squats to help train for that as a supplement.
strength_training,ff9hzuh,t1_ff7rpic,1579713430.0,"Try walking. And try changing your mindset from thinking of why you can't do things to figuring out how you CAN. Baby on the way? You can't afford \*not\* to improve your health so you'll be there for that kid for 18, 25, 40 years and beyond."
strength_training,ff7ret7,t3_es4dp7,1579656532.0,Lifting isn't great as a direct driver of weight loss. It will help indirectly because muscle is metabolically expensive for your body to maintain. I don't know that 3 sets of dumbbells and a bench are really enough to get you the progressive overload you need for the kind of hypertrophy that would gain you that much muscle. Why is cardio off the table? What kind of dietary choices are you making? You won't lose anything without a caloric deficit regardless of your training regimen. Have you considered joining a commercial gym? Lots of cheap options out there.

The reason I'm leaning out is to not be those guys. Sucks to have stalls in strength and a major slowdown in muscle gains, but looking good and not getting winded walking up some stairs is a little more urgent than a new PR."

I had a similar thing happen when I was learning to deadlift. My right hip/glute felt messed up because I was driving harder on my right side than my left. I now mentally focus on generating an equal effort in my right and left leg on compound movements and it seems to help some. Being focused on the muscles and how they're contracting seemed to help me. Hopefully it will help you, and that tingling isn't because of some kind of injury."
