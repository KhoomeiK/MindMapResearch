While you are right about the state of warring in Europe it is important to note that they had enough peace at times to grow a true society. 3 main countrues ruled large tracts of land fairly consitently for centuries on end with barley a change in borders. Not to mention under Roman rule, Europe was allowed to grow exponentially into a vibrant culture due to the the practice of adopting culture rather than destroying it under the Romans. North Africa was just as vibrant under Rome. Then the Roman empire fell and they no longer had the military force to truly fend off southern invasions. I mean, the borders of Africa are fairly new in the mindset of world powers. Europe has remained fairly constant in throughout. And yes, the world wars happened at just the right point in history as to not be able to fully destroy the cultures and intellect of those involved due to the printing press. Culture and knowledge was not lost in such a widescale manner.

I will fully admit that I'm not too up and up on genetic study but isn't the ""mother admixture"" so to speak common in all AHM's and the odd ones that are lacked from race due to interbreeding with protohumans from the regions they crossed paths in?

And I would argue that it takes more than a couple of generations to assimilate on a large scale. This is a point neither of us will sway the other on I feel. 

The average African as in African is still little more than subsistence farming or a style of hunter/gatherer. Culture and increasing the average intelligence requires free time that some areas are not able to have.

Yes, everyone was affected, but it's no big secret that the war on drugs affected minorities to a larger degree than whites. You're being dishonest with your portrayal.

My numbers were off, but it seems the only aspect in which a race received more support than whites was under TANF

What's that? Ghettos on a whole are more crime  ridden than other neighborhoods(all over the world, this isn't a secret) and there are more blacks in ghettos than whites in America?! You seem to be so close to the edgy of intelligence. You can organize an argument, you just can't seem to think or research one well enough. 

No, the iq test is not valid and is being moved away from as a whole or only being accepted as a partial measure that needs to be buffed up
https://www.webmd.com/brain/news/20121218/iq-test-really-measure-intelligence

Oh, adopted blacks still underpreform? Crazy. Blacks underpreformed right after segregation ended? That's really fucking crazy. Adopted kids on a whole underpreform. It is no venture to assume that directly after segregation ended, they would be underpreforming... Seriously, do you think your arguments through?

You haven't provided any facts other than an advertisement to a book and FBI crime statistics.

I'd like to see you accomplish anything with your life before you generalize a race as beneath yourself. Until you can beat out the best among them, you are not above them.

OhItllBeFine,fe08zp1,t1_fe0876y,1578806396.0,"Well no shit ghettos still existed and blacks underperformed. How long do you believe segregation has been canceled for? And to be thrown into the drug war almost immediately after. Pretty fucked. And while.massive amounts of welfare have been thrown at blacks as you put, whites as a whole receive 32% more on average per household that receives welfare and white trash is still around so let's nip thatl argument in the butt before you think it holds water. Iq is not a measure of intelligence, it is a measure of motivation moreso than anything and is very inaccurate as in it changes on a day to day basis. Couple this with the underperforming nature of predominantly single parent households and no shit, it's going to be lower on average. You've put no time into looking at why these disproportions are. You watched shitty YouTube videos with fun little buzzwords thrown in to make it seem like a valid argument but have put in no research on you own or even have the capability to quote anything but a meme for statistics while misunderstanding the definition of what these statistics protray. Your argument is disingenuous and designed to misrepresent an entire race in the negative. Yes, blacks are on average not on par with the white man. Let's give it more than 70 years for them to join society. That's these generations. That's grandparents who were segregated. Wouldn't it be remiss to assume an entire race that was removed from normal society until recently in the scope of america, would be caught up to whites? You're argument is ignorant. That's why it is harmful and racist. Because you won't put in more effort than to research a sub that thinks Shapiro is more than just a strong debater and actually holds valid arguments."
