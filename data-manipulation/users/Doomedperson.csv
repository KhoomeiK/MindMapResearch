spaceengineers,ffgsxc1,t3_etimsq,1579914239.0,"More variety in thrusters is a good idea, but O2 thrusters would be awkward and probably not the right way to go. Maybe you could set up something, but I feel like they'd get outclassed by both ion and hydro thrusters, and generally not be very interesting to build with. I have the basics of a different take on thrusters, have any ideas on how to improve?

Hydrogen thrusters literally spew fusion. They take tons of power and hydrogen, but they can get large ships moving like they've been kicked by Lord Clang himself and melt whatever's in front of them for a long distance.

As a replacement for the atmo to ion transition, we get conventional rockets (chemical? needs a better name).

In a Hydrocarbon Synthesizer (also needs a good name), you can take Hydro plus Carbon (primarily from the upper layers of planetary stone) plus a lot of power to get Hydrocarbons, which you put in a tank and use for Chemical Thrusters, which are big, powerful thrusters that only work in inertial dampers or thrust override, but don't care about atmosphere. They also come in small variants, but those are pretty inefficient.

Pros:

More thruster types.

Thruster types more specialized.

Actual progression in gameplay between flying in planets vs. space.

Less all-or-nothing on getting plat for thrusters before the hydro runs out.

&#x200B;

This is why Role Queue made Overwatch (especially Comp) fun again for me, as a high silver/low gold tank (or occasionally support) player:

It guaranteed a passable team comp. Before, I'd usually see three or more people grab DPS roles almost immediately. This is backed up by queue times; tank queue at 1-2 minutes, DPS at 5 minutes, and support around 3 minutes. Add on people who decide to DPS in other roles to skip the queue, and you'd on average get a 1-3-2 or 1-4-1.

This was just bad. No co-healer turned it into a Moira LMB spam (who else has the raw healing to keep two tanks up?), while no co-tank forced me to hide in cover for a lot of the game to avoid getting melted. Having both a solo tank and a solo healer forced one of us to go either Moira or Hog. Moira has the healing to keep a tank taking the brunt of 3-4 DPS alive, while still having the survivability to avoid getting picked by flankers, while Hog has the self-heal and can peel with hook, allowing the healer to do something but spam heals into him. Neither of these were anywhere close to ideal.

And having a 5 DPS comp, while not extremely common, did happen and was close to an automatic loss. Moira could survive, and had the raw healing, but couldn't reach a spread out team. Mercy could reach them and heal them, but couldn't survive if people didn't always cooperate. And Lucio could reach them and survive, but couldn't keep them alive in the face of a team that didn't have a tank to shoot at. None of the others could do enough of these, except for \*maybe\* Brig on release if they didn't realize that you couldn't actually hit them from outside flail range.

While the lack of flexibility in 2-2-2 is a problem, I have to say that you brought this upon yourself. Healers and tanks couldn't have fun in comp when half the team went off to try to 1v6 the enemy team. I certainly gave up on playing comp; I had a choice between healbot Moira, Hog sitting in a corner waiting for the juice to recharge, or having fun but losing. Blizzard needed to implement a system to sit next to you and hold your hand through the whole thing just so that people could grow up and play seriously in comp.

Overwatch,ffc7nsi,t1_ffbl3tj,1579793423.0,"You usually flank with the teleport, jump down from above or come out from a corner so that you can kill the tanks for a bit, then wraith form back to the team when people start shooting you.

A good tank can also get up close and allow you to deal damage just by taking a ton of space.

And don't underestimate Reaper's guns outside of melee range. Sure, they're pretty weak, but they can finish off an enemy that managed to get a little distance but hasn't quite gotten away yet."

Overwatch,ffb6o1d,t3_esmbdk,1579753231.0,"We already have enough CC in the game. Another form of immobilization (with a powerful projectile character, no less) isn't good.

spaceengineers,ffatddz,t3_esd62e,1579744038.0,"Probably not a standard leveling system where you get points for doing things. It would be hard to implement and feel like an extra addition tacked on for no particular reason.

Suit upgrades would be a lot better, especially if they didn't have as many explicit tiers as different modules that are more like sidegrades."
Overwatch,ffapx4f,t3_esj5sd,1579741728.0,"Moira is good at that rank. You can survive, keep everyone alive even if your co-healer is a DPS skipping the lines, and occasionally help get picks.

Hog is also not bad at carrying just a little. Break barriers, be a damage sponge for your teammates, get picks, and make it easier for the healers too.

If you have good aim, Widow, Ashe, and Hanzo allow you to climb by just getting picks every fight. Junkrat can often get the trap + mine at the start of the game, and he's fairly easy to spam down a crowded corridor that they will push anyway. Also, the RIP-tire almost always makes it because of bad aim. Reaper can crush inexperienced tanks, and hopefully your team can mop up the rest. His ult also usually goes better when people don't always use CC in time."
