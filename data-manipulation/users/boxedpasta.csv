Compare the barcodes and matrix/runout on the side. The identifiable difference between the 2006 issues are the barcodes and matrix/run outs. For example, [here](https://www.discogs.com/Taylor-Swift-Taylor-Swift/release/9166257) is a 2006 copy with the censored verions. Always check the barcodes on discogs, people usually write notes on the listings to tell you the details. You can also buy cds right off this site, but I don’t have any experience with that. Hope this helps!! :)"

TaylorSwift,fdibsbj,t3_eljg9p,1578439380.0,"Not sure if you are familiar with Discogs, but it is like a huge database website with every version of a release. [Here](https://www.discogs.com/Taylor-Swift-1989/release/12937243) is the page for the vinyl I think you’re looking for. Compare the barcodes and matrixes of the vinyl listed and the one on this page to see if they match. If not, this is probably inauthentic. There was a normal re-release of this clear/pink vinyl variant [(US release)](https://www.discogs.com/Taylor-Swift-1989/release/11898686) [(Europe release)](https://www.discogs.com/Taylor-Swift-1989/release/11894007) and then a super limited amount that is signed (as linked before). The barcodes and matrix run outs are usually a tell-all sign when cross compared with the Discogs page. The Big Machine Records label of the signed and unsigned versions differ by just a few characters at the end. Hope this helps!!"

college,fd781y1,t1_fcvadks,1578200648.0,I do the same. My school has a huge commuter population on top of having a huge student body in general and parking is usually full around noon or 1pm. So I usually try to take earlier classes so I can actually get parking.

vegetarian,fctez7z,t3_eilkcx,1577941127.0,"NTA. You ordered it without chicken and the restaurant messed up your order. You can't just pick it out because it often leaves behind pieces, whether you missed them or they leave behind crumbs/small pieces. Your mom should understand that you don't want to just pick it out if you have avoided meat for four years. Plus eating meat after not having it for such a long time can be a shock to your system and possibly make you sick."

My GI was just basically going through every test since he did not trust my previous doctor's diagnosis and my case came with a lot of uncertainty (a pediatric doctor literally wrote something along the lines of 'could be but not sure' on my diagnosis). He was doing test after test until he could either 100% diagnose me or rule it out. 

As far as my symptoms, I've always had stomach issues ever since I was a baby. I've never been able to eat a lot without experiencing some degree of pain. I would either be on the toilet all night in a lot of pain or in a lot of pain but unable to go. I also experienced throwing up everything from time to time and real bad nausea. Basically, food made me sick in some way almost every time I ate."

CrohnsDisease,fcpfiei,t3_ehux1s,1577861716.0,My best advice would be to keep a food log to keep track of everything you eat and what symptoms they cause. That way you know what to steer clear from when cooking or going out. Make sure to actually record everything for your own sake. My first food log didn’t go so well because I didn’t put everything down so I was blaming the wrong foods/ingredients.
