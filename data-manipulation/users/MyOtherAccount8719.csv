Albuquerque,ff00fjt,t3_er05we,1579463826.0,How can they hate us if they don't even know we're a part of the country?

OddlyErotic,feynjbp,t3_eqpvpv,1579447998.0,Use the power of the boner to hook in at the top. That should give you a few seconds to rest your hands... Then you know what to do after that. Chalk up.
Albuquerque,feygxhl,t1_fewh3n6,1579445390.0,"I had one try to fight me about two or three years ago.
They kept leaving their stupid little flyers on my door despite there being a no soliciting sign. One day I happened to be heading out the door when they did it. I asked the guy if he saw the ""no soliciting"" sign. His response was ""we're not trying to sell anything, it's different. If you have a problem call the pastor."".  So I did, and the pastor kept trying to get my address (in a very angry tone) so that they could stop leaving them and then he told me if I didn't want them to bring them to him and tell him to his face. It escalated from there and he began threatening to ""kick my ass"". 
It was a real heartwarming Christian love moment."

unpopularopinion,fempgjf,t3_epry71,1579265680.0,"I was dating a girl for a very short period of time and when she found out I lived with my grandma (I'm in my early thirties) she decided we should stop dating. What she didn't know is that I didn't live my grandma, my grandma lived with me. I own my home and have since I was in my early twenties. My grandma moved in about 6 months before the girl and I started dating. She was unhappy where she was living and so I moved her in. I never bothered correcting her in thinking that I was a loser, she clearly was not worth the time and effort."
