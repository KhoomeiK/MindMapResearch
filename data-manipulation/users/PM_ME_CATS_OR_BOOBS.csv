ToiletPaperUSA,fdr8dx4,t1_fdr678c,1578680919.0,If you are using plate armor you wouldn't be using swords at all. Historically it would be hand to hand with daggers or just fists. There were a lot of cases where nobles in fancy armor got taken out by unwashed peasants who dragged them off their horses and bashed their helmets in with rocks
ToiletPaperUSA,fdr50u7,t1_fdr290g,1578679636.0,"Sure there are some swords that were massive heavy, but as you said they were pretty rare.

Honestly it's kind of a moot point since swords were not used in combat nearly as much as movies say they were. Spears for infantry and halberd for mounted knights were the primary weapons. Hell, knights mostly fought other knights with daggers or beating the shit out of them with their gauntlets.

Swords kind of suck, tbh"
ToiletPaperUSA,fdqyywn,t1_fdqy6mk,1578677072.0,"You're about ten times too high, historical longswords only weigh about 3-4 pounds. You'd break your wrist trying to fight with a 30 pound one

Most wood splitting axes are roughly 3-6 pounds, for comparison"
ToiletPaperUSA,fdqy2w5,t1_fdqxmp6,1578676532.0,Especially against enemies with any armor at all. You don't slash through chainmail.
ToiletPaperUSA,fdqw8di,t1_fdqtwyk,1578675697.0,"I mean, in practice maybe. If it was real sword I am curious how being really good at stabbing people would be a negative"

aww,fdnxsxx,t1_fdnd0t0,1578595025.0,My conure absolutely refused to use any real baths. I would get him nice fresh water in proper bathing sizes and he would always just go back to bathing in his drinking water bowl that he constantly drops seeds into.
facepalm,fdkvgxd,t1_fdkrxqi,1578511994.0,"Depends on the people I guess. They renovated, but a popular club in Ann Arbor used to have no doors on the stalls and everyone just uses whatever bathroom. It's the kind of anarchy you expect out of college towns."

facepalm,fdf3zmt,t1_fdeyt9b,1578352779.0,"You can only change the sound by holding down strings between the reciever/body of the guitar and the capo, but since she is holding it above the capo she isn't doing anything."
facepalm,fdevc33,t1_fdeoi96,1578347364.0,"The longer the string is, the deeper the sound, right? But if you have a song that is all higher notes, you don't want to constantly be holding down all the strings at once. So you use a capo, which is a clip with a heavy spring on it that clamps down every string to the same, higher tone that allows you to play open (ie no finger involved) notes at a higher pitch."

news,fd4y8w4,t1_fd4nlus,1578172311.0,"It's probably more that you just weren't paying attention during the Obama admin.

But okay, you say the outrage isn't as strong. It probably has something to do with those drone strikes being performed with even the smallest semblance of necessity and while informing our allies rather that doing a sudden and unknown strike because the president realized he can't see his dick without a mirror that morning."
GetMotivated,fd4pxyu,t1_fd4oo2j,1578169928.0,"So he is so fluent in media that he has games, books, and tv shows involving him but he's also so entirely braindead that he keeps saying super shitty things on camera"

GetMotivated,fd4jbn6,t1_fd3y1jd,1578168009.0,It has had a weird arc. It's incomprehensible if you don't know where it came from but the journey from start to finish is full of a lot of Weird Internet People.

Throw in a couple hours of ""actual zelda gameplay"" into a 50 hour game and it makes the rest of the game look lesser by comparison."

Authentic WWII memorabilia is hard to replace, after all."
BreadTube,fcvhxzo,t1_fcukue2,1578002460.0,"Can you really describe Contra as the oppressed person in this situation? The fight is basically between her and a ton of queer Twitter people, and I wouldn't call the person with a massively popular series and loads of fans ""oppressed"" by a bunch of random scrubs wanting her to be better."

You might not go for an ivy or private school and still rack up debt if you go to one with name recognition. University of Michigan, my state's big name university, is 15k annually for in state. If you are out of state, it's 45k like the table above."
