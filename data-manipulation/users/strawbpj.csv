I often just put a bit of oil in and just start cooking the egg without letting it heat up anyways lol. But medium heat is the best for eggs because it can splatter with hot oil and burn. 
2. It depends on how thick or small you cut and cook the vegetables and meat, and also what you're using. For example, fish cooks VERY quickly compared to potatoes. But potatoes cook faster than meat. The thicker and harder your vegetable, the more time it'll take to cook. Same with meat. Thicker cuts of meat take longer; if you want to cook it quickly, cut it into smaller pieces. 
3. I think it depends on your own stove. I recently got a new stovetop and oven and I use lower heat compared to my old one. Try experimenting on lower heats first and you can always increase it if needed. But it's harder to save something that gets burned up right away.
4. One of the easiest recipes I've learned was curry. I use premade curry blocks or powder. You just cook onions, potatoes, and add any other vegetables you'd like, then dissolve the curry with some water or stock. You can add coconut milk as well. Recipes can always be changed, so if something is too difficult, you can change things around. Broccoli cheddar soup is also super simple, with relatively the same ingredients. Boil broccoli, drain, cook onions and any other veggies, then add stock, milk, and cheese. Both of these have a lot of cooking aspects that can help you get a bit more comfortable in the kitchen, with preparation, to cooking."
beermoney,ffbl5jt,t3_esikic,1579770651.0,"I’ve been using it for a while (maybe 9 months?) and I’ve made about $19. It’s not bad since all you have to do is scan the receipt once and it loads a lot faster than other scanner apps. Sometimes, I’ll get up to $0.19 for a receipt but it’s mostly $0.03-$0.01. I mostly keep it since it’s quick and easy and requires no additional effort aside from one picture. You could definitely collect more if you buy more things and get more receipts, but I typically only have 1-2 receipts a week."
WomensHealth,ff71tbr,t3_erzzyj,1579639432.0,"I'm East Asian and I have a lot of dark, thick hair all over my body as well. It's definitely on my back, chest, butt, everywhere. It's pretty normal to have but definitely shot my self esteem growing up. Laser hair removal is gonna be the best bet if you want to get rid of all the hair but it's very expensive, especially for full body. Waxing works as well but it takes a longer time and you'll definitely feel the pain if you wax all over the body. And waxing doesn't last forever. You can try bleaching the hair, but make sure you do it safely because it can cause problems with your skin. Swimming a lot can naturally lighten hair all over the body because of the chlorine and sun exposure."
WomensHealth,ff4mex7,t3_eriplf,1579567139.0,"For me personally, masturbating doesn't really feel ""good"" either. It's just a strange feeling that makes me want to continue doing it. It only really starts to feel ""good"" when I'm about to orgasm. As others have said, finding the things you enjoy masturbating to is key. I prefer audio and videos, much like many others, so try experimenting and finding what you like."
cookingforbeginners,fej0lgk,t3_epcibw,1579152649.0,"Use gloves! There are gloves specifically made for handling food (like the people handing out samples at Costco). My OCD makes it so I wash my hands after touching basically anything that I believe to be contaminated or just dirty/gross, etc and so my hands have always been super cracked and dry. Wearing these gloves helps a lot. I also use chopsticks to hold onto raw fish and raw meat but you can find metal tongs that are easy to use to pick things up! That way, you won't need to touch it at all. 

If you're afraid of contamination on your surfaces, put newspapers down! My parents collect them whenever they go out anywhere and bring a stack home and we use them as mats. I put plates on top of the newspaper with saran wrap over it to avoid touching meat as much as possible. And I always wash things that have touched raw meat right away with the water as hot as it can be. (Try to get rubber gloves to protect your hands if you wash with hot water!)"
ARFID,feeqf4i,t3_eos58k,1579039019.0,"If you can't chew well, you can try making smoothies and drinking those. People tend to pack lots of fruit and some veggies that can help give you more calories, rather than if you were to eat that amount in the day."
college,fedykkb,t3_eomjwv,1579022615.0,"I don’t “study” in the traditional sense. What I do is I write things down over and over that I think are important to know because it helps me remember it. I’m not able to sit down and try to cram for several hours a day but whenever I have some free time or there’s a break, I’ll take a couple minutes to rewrite things I need to know for a class. For example, I’m currently taking a statistics course. I write the formulas over and over and make sure I also write out in words, what the formula is meant to do. This method works for me because I’m the type who is able to remember better when I write things out, combined with doing it a lot of times to get it down."
relationship_advice,febtmub,t3_eodbal,1578962587.0,"So, you don't like your girlfriend, you don't want to be with her, you don't want to have sex with her, you don't even want to TALK to her. It's selfish to try to keep her around you just because you won't find anyone better, when she could be with someone who actually likes her. You don't like her. At all. She deserves someone who does. She's already put more than enough effort into your relationship, let her go."
WomensHealth,fe57ucd,t1_fe53795,1578866373.0,thank you for the advice!
WomensHealth,fe50ety,t1_fe4v038,1578864536.0,"It’s a culture thing to only use pads! Sorry my wording is not very good. But I assume it would be more difficult because there’s lots of hair that gets stuck, personally because I do not groom down there. I find that pubic hair gets stuck to my pads as well and in general, I shed a lot of hair overall."
WomensHealth,fe49fnk,t3_enqewp,1578857011.0,"I don’t groom myself down there. I’ve tried before but even just trimming makings me ITCH like crazy. This sucks as well because since I can’t shave my pubic hair, I also only use pads, and it can get kind of bloody down there."
Sims4,fdryvhc,t3_emvfp9,1578691824.0,I've tried to create lots of different sims but I always feel like they turn out looking similar anyways !!
college,fdo5o7c,t3_emenl9,1578599336.0,"I always get reviews of the professor by other students who have taken them and the syllabus usually doesn't match their teaching style. For example, my current professor stated that all phones and devices should be off and put away during class but he told us the first day that we should be using MS Excel and he'll allow us to use our laptops during tests for it lol. I think syllabus is for general information and what the professor is required by the school to include but doesn't reflect their own teaching style and rules."
WomensHealth,fdcoh5l,t3_ekmzvl,1578280020.0,"I had a similar situation, the side of my breast was super dry and itchy. I bought Aquaphor for another skin related issue and it helped smooth out the skin on my breast. It's just a topical cream like vaseline but it helped heal my dry skin so fast"
college,fcvadks,t1_fcum1ah,1577997965.0,"I have a lot of worries about missing class or not being able to find parking so I tend to get there as early as I can for the first few weeks. Then once people start to drop classes and settle into the semester, I’m a little more lenient with my times. Good luck this semester!"
college,fctroh8,t3_eitwz9,1577955986.0,"I can relate to this a lot. I get so anxious and worried about the upcoming semester right before it starts. I find that to help me ease some of my worries, I write down a lot of lists or charts that basically map out my entire day. I write down what classes I have each day, and plan out a checklist of what I need to prepare beforehand/bring to the class. I commute so I also plan out my sleeping schedule and what times I should get up, how long I can lay in bed for, when I have to leave, and how long it will take me to get to the school and find parking. This helps me keep myself focused on what needs to be done."
