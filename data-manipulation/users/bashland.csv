bipolar,fecdza1,t3_eoc2bz,1578971650.0,"Yes, mindfulness can diminish depression, and yes it's still depression.  Mindfulness is an altered state of consciousness, like sleep in some ways.  What I think mindfulness meditation does is help me focus on something other than the depression. Instead of feeling the pain, my focus is on what I'm doing.

I'm a Buddhist, practice mindfulness meditation daily/almost every day.  Helps me sleep, which alone is a big help.  Here is a more in-depth article, if you're interested:  [https://www.excelatlife.com/articles/relaxation.htm](https://www.excelatlife.com/articles/relaxation.htm)"

Big task, lots of things to do, hard to know where to start. Easy to say heck it, I have (vague excuse), I can do this tomorrow. Less time = more pressure, repeat cycle.
