teenagers,fe5xhbh,t1_fe5hm7o,1578877126.0,"Np good luck, just remember I'm not a medical professional I just had an interest in weight gain a while ago and the same factors apply to weight loss."
teenagers,fe5hk3i,t1_fe5grih,1578869472.0,"That's rough and probably a big factor, I don't know much about tea but I don't think it's bad for weight, maybe shifting up his diet would be the best option, noodles and pasta and stuff isn't the healthiest and probably calorie and carb intensive. Maybe have him start using a calorie counter and see if his intake is more than he needs which you could find out roughly online and all you need his his age, height and stuff. If that doesn't work maybe he should see a professional if that's an option."

teenagers,fdpdrzw,t1_fdpdh46,1578626059.0,If your main reason isn't her body then your fine but you probably shouldn't advance on her because the age difference. It would only be fucked if you liked her young body because that's borderline paedophilia but yea ur good.
