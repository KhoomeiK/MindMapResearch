Also, he has a teleportation technique that is supposedly better than Goku's.  
Plus, Goku fought in an environment without oxygen in his fight against Beerus."

Daredevil would be able to ""see"" at all times and he wouldn't be to get the drop on someone like Spiderman."

Saiyans aren't biologically evil if it was like that Vegeta would have never been redeemed.

Also, Tarble was never hit on the head and he didn't turn out evil."

 I am sure Gohan would have turned him into a good person, eventually."

But, apparently when Dooku saw just how powerful and evil Yoda has become for the split second he fell to the dark side, he decided that the idea was a terrible one."

He would have easily won if he was in his prime."
whowouldwin,fdbjaev,t1_fda5ino,1578257878.0,">Iâ€™d say this would be very hard to pull off, at the beginning of the prequels the Jedi were not trusted in the senate, and all throughout the Clone Wars Palpatine did nothing but seed distrust. I think testing on such a wide scale would be politically maneuvered around with the Jedi backing it publicly, and if there was no public backing from a significant entity L would be ignored entirely.

We are talking about the possibility of one of them being a sith lord, you don't send interns to do that sort of thing."

Especially the frog boss which only took me about two or three times to beat on Jedi master difficulty. 

I still haven' beaten her yet. Also, just in general, fuck that probe droid that comes out of nowhere. It's really fucking annoying and I have no idea why they would put that bullshit in this fight when Trilla is enough of a challenge on her own."
