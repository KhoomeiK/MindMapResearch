The wings aren't always the same airfoil along the length of the wing, and it almost always twists and tapers.

Every rudder I know of is symmetric. It might have a cant angle to counteract rotation due to prop wash, but usually it's trimmed out with the trim tab.

Elevators control pitch and balance the plane on the lift of the main wing. They can be cambered or symmetric depending on what you need."

AskEngineers,fdpuqob,t1_fdowkxi,1578641289.0,"To add to XBL's response, *anything* that isn't completely round can generate lift. A lot of shapes are absolutely horrible at it, but an airfoil's primary advantage is that it provides very efficient lift. You can see lift (and drag) in action when you stick your hand out the window in a flat shape and twist it in the air stream.

Cambered airfoils (the special slightly cupped teardrop shapes you are thinking of) have the advantage of providing lift at zero angle of attack. This means you don't have to constantly tip the airplane nose up to get enough lift to fly. We couldn't be so easily served our in- flight drinks and peanuts this way. Instead, the cupped shape creates lift without needing to raise the nose of the aircraft, and the teardrop shape is simply to make it all happen more smoothly and efficiently."
AskEngineers,fdptypp,t1_fdoycln,1578640380.0,You are probably right on that one. I never had more than the one aerodynamics course in college.
AskEngineers,fdotu2i,t3_emgx5n,1578612731.0,"Edit: As the user below states, this is likely a simplification. I would expect tumbling, but a car is a more complex shape (most importantly: a thick shape) than thin airfoil theory can reliably approximate.

I would expect tumbling, but it is possible a stable condition exists. It likely is not the forward direction since cars don't have to be aerodynamically stable (center of pressure behind center of gravity), especially not on all axes. 

Original comment:

It would start flipping.

The center of lift develops \~1/4 of the way from the front of an airfoil and the center of gravity is in the center in this case. This causes an unbalanced net torque, resulting in the car flipping on the way down.

You can try this at home with an index card. If you drop it edge first, it may drop straight very briefly, but then will start flipping. If you drop it face first, it will eventually start flipping, but can be somewhat stable if you spin the card."

CatastrophicFailure,fdkrhot,t1_fdkljwi,1578509631.0,"You could know that it crashed due to technical difficulties if you didn't shoot it down.

737 doesn't explode into a ball of fire mid air: I mean, it's not supposed to. If the engine explodes, it can. If the fuel pump explodes, it does. If the fuel tank inert atmosphere system fails, it may. If the fuel tank ruptures, it likely will. (fatigue, exceeded flight envelope safety limits, other serious pilot error)

As for timing: correlation does not imply causation. While the cause absolutely should be reviewed with a special consideration for if a missile or gun brought it down, it **does not** logically follow that it must have been shot down if there are other reasonable options that have not yet been investigated."
