Wellthatsucks,feuq7h3,t1_feunkg6,1579388964.0,"""Artistic expression covered by non incitive freedom of speech in the human rights act."" 

Well, freedom of speech does not overrule private property, so your point is moot. Furthermore, ""freedom of speech"" is something people that don't understand the 1st ammendment love to throw around. 

""Artistic expression"" is not a legally protected right, nor priveledge.
The ""freedom of speech"" does NOT allow you to vandalize private property.

Vandalism is defined:
Vandalism

The intentional and malicious destruction of or damage to the property of another.

The intentional destruction of property is popularly referred to as vandalism. It includes behavior such as breaking windows, slashing tires, spray painting a wall with graffiti, and destroying a computer system through the use of a computer virus. Vandalism is a malicious act and may reflect personal ill will, although the perpetrators need not know their victim to commit vandalism. The recklessness of the act imputes both intent and malice.


1. By painting the house with Graffiti, he has damaged the private property. (I don't have to define damage, do I? Lets just say the owner has to pay another guy to paint his house now. That's financial damage.)

2. By showing the message about not paying, he has demonstrated his intent and his motive for the damage.

That's pretty much it. It's a very simple case. There is no such thing as artistic freedom non inciting whatever. 

The facts are: The painter got stiffed, so he vandalized the homeowner's house to force him to pay the bill. 

Has a crime been committed? Yes.
Is the painter guilty? Yes."
todayilearned,feuom2i,t1_feuo5e5,1579388524.0,"Sorry, I keep re-reading but did you mix up the negative/positive or am I dumb?

So you're saying... you've never left a job in a state that you actually wanted to put them on the resume....?

Were you trying to say the opposite thing? That you never got canned so hard you had to leave them off?"
todayilearned,feunrcb,t1_feun1cy,1579388336.0,"No... that's not how it works. 

They ask for 3 references and I provide them. I usually provide 2 immediate coworkers (my work buddies basically), and I do have jobs that ive left amicably, so I can provide those supervisors.

However, it usually doesn't even come to that - getting fired in a professional setting is a professional action, no hard feelings. Often times when you get fired, it's actually HR or an upper manager looking at the numbers that fires you. Your manager is usually like ""Look, i had your back... but... I gotta fire you man.""

So 3/4 times they're still willing to be a positive reference for you. You don't have to give them the 4th one's number."
todayilearned,feum683,t1_feum0pm,1579387869.0,"I have spent 67 nights in jail. It's really not that bad. Depends which pod you end up, too. There's good pods for good boys where they give you laptops to play with (as part of a school/ged program). Then there's bad places for bad boys where they don't give you underwear or clothes cause you might hurt yourself.

Be a good boy and you'll be aight."
Wellthatsucks,feulv1u,t1_feu2u08,1579387766.0,"What you fail to realize is the failure to pay is a CIVIL matter, but vandalism is a CRIMINAL offense.  By escalating from civil to criminal, this painter is putting himself in big liability. The criminal courts do not deal with unpaid bills. The painter has to go to small claims court and sue the client, get a judgement, then attempt to collect the money through legal channels.

This is retaliatory vandalism, and while not the right word, kind of ""vigilantism"". The truth is - the homeowner has rights too. He is innocent until proven guilty, and even then - there is no such thing as Debtors Prison in the states, which means the homeowner can never go to jail.

The criminal court can only focus on the crime - of vandalism - that has been obviously committed. To prove the crime, you need to show intent and motive, and there is a clear motive here because the guy didn't get paid.

The painter is guilty of vandalism, a misdemeanor that carries up to 1 year in jail and up to a 1000 dollar fine, and restitution to the homeowner. 

The restitution will likely be in the form of painting the house to the original specifications set by the homeowner.

For many reasons, Americans culturally gravitate towards the former. That is why we have commercials and Kardashians instead of soft witty talk shows. 

That is why we have Trump. Let's not lie, he's entertaining! It's fun to watch him crash and burn, and it's even funner everyone fuming at him... as if that's not exactly what he wants? He's a typical level 2 troll. He probably hasn't even got his ironic nazi tatoo yet.

Anyway, so... nobody is voting anyone in. Americans are wasting time (like I am right now, talking about nonsense) instead of actually doing some research about the laws, learning how everything works, etc. 

These peolpe REALLY think... that like... politics works like ""Hey we've got this great guy! WE all want to vote for him!""

Nobody ever asks... where these canditates are coming from... why their party has chosen them, they don't ever ask to exchange them! 

Americans have always been okay with having the majority of choices made for them, with only two left - BLUE or RED.

If I was a cop I could charge that kid with assault on a minor. The obvious question would be ""Why the fuck didn't you walk away from that dumbass kid?""

I couldn't charge the kid with anything cause he's a fucking kid and he doesn't know any better. 

A 10 year old does NOT understand the consequences of brandishing a hammer...

WinStupidPrizes,fcvdy0m,t1_fcva5gx,1578000086.0,"I mean... look dude. A judge would say this:

Kid attacking adult with hammer is almost harmless - the worst he can get is a bruise, and it probably wouldn't get to that point (as you can see from the video).

At the same time, that fall and that hit to the back of his head... that could have ended up pretty badly... I mean the mind is a mystery.... that kind obviously already has a little bit of ""problems"" - anywhere from an overinflated ego to a murderous psycopathic rage deep down... but physical violence rarely helps those kind of mental issues.

This kid, while the chance is small, could have permanent brain damage from that fall.

Look, I'm not saying it's not satisfying to see the little shit get what he deserved... but that's just our perception, through our own moral compass. It feels satisfying, but in reality it was NOT OKAY.

Don't trip little kids. Yeah, yeah he's an asshole, but he's a little kid and he can't do any damage. 

It's like fighting an old alcoholic man... he can barely stand, and yes he keeps calling your mom a whore, and your girl, and everyone else. But knocking him out... and causing him some serious damage is not what a strong man would do.  A strong man would use patience and avoid fighting a defenseless (too drunk) man...

TL;DR:  Kids are nothing but tiny alcoholic assholes, but don't hit them."

And the hot sauce. THE DAMN HOT SAUCE they have is the BEST. I think it's that lousiana rooster one.

You're a software engineer. That pays much more then a baby sitter. It makes your rate of $35 prohibitively expensive.

The tactful way to do this would be to simply reject the offer in the first place. I doubt anyone will be paying $35 an hour when they can find someone with more experience, and that charges the going rate of about $20/hr (my ex used to be a nanny)

It's the same thing if someone asked me to help them move a bunch of heavy furniture... considering my medical bills for my back, my freelance hours, etc, I'd be charging like $100 bucks an hour lol. Of course I'm not going to say that...  I would just say ""sorry I got a bad back"" or something.

Leave the jobs to the professionals. It's a bit offensive charging that much, especially for ""family"".  Of course, if you DONT charge that much, they'll take advantage of your and expect you to baby sit for 15 bucks every time. That's what ""family"" does )

Next time, think ahead, make your own decision, realize it's too much, and save everyone the trouble of getting mad at you.

35 is ridiculous, it really has nothing to do with your time, it's just high for the market. I'd be charging $20/hour minimum to collect cans, but the homeless do it for free..."
