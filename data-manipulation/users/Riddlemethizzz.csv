Even if someone has thoughts that are bad, they can recognize it’s bad thought and never act on it and self-rewire their brain to not think those things. That’s called being a human, which is self-aware. 

Anxiety disorder and a pedo are not even close to the same level, are you seriously comparing the two? 

Saying things to another adult is not the same thing as using your power over a child to sexually abuse them, it’s not even close. One is making a mistake, the other is someone who preys on the weak and vulnerable. 

There’s no need to understand someone who actively scars people’s children, society cannot be a good society if it tolerates those who have no place. This used to be something known as common sense but now there are folks like you who try to understand them, for what?

People who do that shit used to be hung publicly, or beaten publicly. When a person sees consequences like that with their own eyes, they either make the decision to never do it or they do it anyway. Now all punishment is done behind closed doors. 

If they are people capable of thought, they are capable of knowing right from wrong. If they know it’s wrong and still do it, they get the noose. If they don’t know it’s wrong, they’re nothing more than an animal that also gets the noose.

I personally have friends who need to be submissive to their wives/GF because if they don’t, the other things they offer aren’t enough so they offer the “companionship” the girl wants.

A girl that hoes around usually ends up with some sort of issues, whether it is trust, self confidence, heaven forbid an STD or something permanent. It’s usually the emotional scars that hang around, and it makes relationships with them tough. So as a preference I try to avoid them, but girls KNOW if they had a “slut phase” as they like to call it, it has a decent possibility of turning a guy off to them, especially one they deem desirable and they may hide it or not let on as much until later in the relationship when you’re already in kind of deep (from my experience lol)."

However, having a shit mother has always made me a little suspicious of girls. When your mom dips at age 11 and you haven’t spoken since, any girl that “loves” me could leave me too, and that thought never leaves my mind. 

Also, playing video games, having a brew whenever I want, sleeping when I want, leaving the dishes in the sink for more than 5 minutes...the list goes on lol. 

Besides the crap mother and freedom, when I’m just thinking about it I think lots girls demand too much for what they bring to the table. Each girl I’ve dated has had an...extensive sexual history. Whether y’all agree or not sex is a big deal to me. I prefer not to date ex-hoes, but so often I meet a girl that’s great and as it turns out she was a hoeeeee. With that brings other problems, her history causes her to think or react to certain things a certain way (as they have said), ex-fuck buddies hitting them up all the time, seeing ex-fuck buds or hook ups in public etc...yet I’m supposed to give my emotion, time, energy, commitment and money to someone who can fill a classroom with the dudes she’s messed with. 

Though I’ve been told I’m attractive, I have like the lowest sexual partner count among my friends. I only recently passed one of my friends because he’s been married for like 4 years. The other one is now married but I’m still behind lol.

AskMen,fdha5wc,t3_eleoqb,1578418692.0,I don’t have a GF atm but a GF is the only one I go down on. I do not go down on hookups.
AskMen,fdg8fnn,t3_el8ibg,1578384436.0,"Because LTR are a waste. Been there, done that. Time, money, emotions, connection, all flushed down the drain with nothing to show for it."
AskMen,fdeprl6,t1_fdeog79,1578344064.0,"Happened to me with my last 2 exes. They had guy “friends” that would text them. I was uncomfortable with it to be honest, because I knew their intention.  If she talked to anyone she had sex with before I let her know I’m definitely not cool with that and I’ll leave the relationship I’m not playing games like that. 

I made my not being cool with it known and it didn’t stop them anyway. They just hid it from me completely because once we broke up, not even a week later they’re going on dates. Two year relationships just thrown away and forgotten within a week. Meanwhile here I am years later still wondering where I went wrong. But I have to stop blaming myself for everything.

Relationships in the modern world are frustrating. It’s never just you two, it’s you and her and whoever each person wants to let in on the relationship. And those guy “friends” are always playing the field and hitting up girls to keep in their back pocket in case the girl is single again."

Edit: lmao down votes? For what? You guys need to chill out 😂. Lmao more downvotes, just for saying I am killing it with specialist. But ya let’s not talk about the game we play. Good to know. Time to downvote everyone all the time."
