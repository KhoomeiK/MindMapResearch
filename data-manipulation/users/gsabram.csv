For what it’s worth, it’s not just a dislike of being asked questions or being held responsible for editorial decisions (although that’s problematic on its own).  

There needs to be a pretty strongly drawn line between fandoms and creative teams these days.  A single sentence said by a beta reader at the wrong time to a random stranger can ruin a marketing campaign, hurt sales, etc.  without you intending it.  It’s happened for other books.  By asking questions of these fans who have quasi-influence over the author and quasi access to the editing team, you are opening up fans like yourself to real money lawsuits from the publisher and Brandon.

Sure you have the right to ask questions of Brandon and his team.  As a present and possibly future customer, That goes without saying.  But seeking out beta readers sounds like you created a division between by seeking out privileged info about a growing, popular, and ongoing series.  You’ve also seemed to completely ignore the (very obvious) possibility that the plot point you wanted resolves in a more complex way than a single book could manage."

I think the Caminoans snagged his DNA behind EVERYONE’s back not knowing much about Yoda or Jedi except rumors; and the Empire only discovers Baby Yoda’s rumored existence sometime during the original trilogy or by occupying Camino and finding records.

Most of all I think SW rebels, season-next will put to rest our questions so that most casual Mando watchers who don’t also watch Disney kids SW will probably find out the origin from their children, siblings or hardcore SW fans.

(Not to say the CGI in Dark Crystal is realism, just that it’s verging on indistinguishable from the puppets/animatronics so at least one step closer to realistic).

Also I’m willing to bet that book 4 will explicitly detail something or other action Dalinar takes in furtherance of repenting for his genocide at the rift, now that he *can* remember it.  From his visit to The Valley through the middle of Oathbringer his lives a life unaware he *had* such a sin to atone for, but now that he remembers and thanks to a boon that allowed him to move past and improve himself first, atoning should be a driving motivation by the time he finishes writing his memoirs."
