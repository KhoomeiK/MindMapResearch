I have a loud terrier who makes an amazing people deterrent. She can discriminate whether it’s someone “known” before they enter our yard and won’t bark if it’s us. My sammy usually stares at her curiously and quietly when she is barking her fool head off."
dogs,ffffxir,t3_etbs3d,1579883100.0,"There’s a whole market of retail rescue where small rescues mainly in Texas airmail you a rescue dog via Delta. They post the dogs in zip codes of urban areas in Boston so people contact them about it. They then charge somewhere between $700-950 to airmail you the dog. Most of the dogs are suspiciously “adoptable”, like cute young puppies or poodle mixes. 

I’m not against domestic transport rescue and worked at a Massachusetts rescue for over a year. It’s vexing though because those rescues that are ACTUALLY charge $500 at a loss and are transparent with their fees are following 48 hour interstate quarantine laws put in by the agriculture department of Massachusetts to prevent disease from spreading, and also provide local support to be able to return the dog if it doesn’t work out. The airmail rescues without local presence circumvent quarantining and don’t have that local support and it just skeeves me out."
dogs,ffe2s6s,t1_ffb71nw,1579835202.0,When they have single day audits open you should definitely consider coming your favorite day if you can! They don’t usually sell out for awhile IIRC. It’s fairly inexpensive and it’s a great way to find people close to you in the training community.
samoyeds,ffe2ly1,t1_ffb563v,1579835073.0,">	I haven't heard of active and passive training. Is it commonly difficult for a sammy to learn this?

Not really but it’s not something you’ll commonly find in even group pet dog classes. You might teach you dog to settle on a mat and I love classes that teach that. I do dog sports with my dog and it’s something that is a bit more valuable when training for that stuff but it’s useful.

Many sports dogs and attention loving breeds will go to great lengths to receive attention (barking included). They are quick to turn on when food is involved and working with their human is a form of receiving attention. That’s why I teach an active settle/down and more of a passive one - if I want a dog to “chill” and relax it will be pretty frustrated if it thinks it’s lying down because we are gonna do a training session and both is valid.

I train a lot of passive behaviors using Kathy Sdao’s SMARTx50 system. The idea is you ration out at least 50 treats every day (really small treats, or kibble), put them in a few jars or in your pocket, and any time a dog chooses to do something with you or does something on its own you like, you reward them with a treat. It’s a great way in addition to formal training sessions to encourage your dog to do stuff you want. Sammies are smart and if they get rewarded for something they did on their own they’re likely to try it again for more rewards in the future.

I taught my dog most of his useful life skills using passive, informal sessions. Like the puppy in the video, when he would chill out on the rug not destroying stuff he got treats without a big fanfare or got to work on a chew. If he put himself in his crate on his own I’d chuck a small chunk of cheese in there. If he picked up a toy and brought it to me I would tug with him a little bit, then trade it for some snacks. When he brought me random objects I’d trade it for praise, pets, and food. When he chose to lean into me instead of jumping up on me I’d pet him and give him treats. I didn’t really have to work super hard at much of those things, I just told him in food and praise I liked what he did and he would just continue to do those things into his adulthood. His puppy cousin barked for attention way more than mine did, which turned into her stealing objects to get my attention, so I spent most of that video secretly filming her, faking ignoring her, and throwing cheese at her when she was still. That way when she chose to bark, and nothing came of it, she’d rack her little brain to remember she got a lot of cheese for lying down and relaxing. She got really good at it the week she was with us!"
samoyeds,ffe1ifv,t1_ffbuj03,1579834269.0,"Spay coat is real. I spend more time around intact Sammies, and a dog has been altered for at least a year or 1-2 major coat blows I can tell it is altered by looking at it with high accuracy. Most breeders can tell immediately.

The coat often gets bigger and holds in dirt well, loses its harshness and becomes soft and cottony. It also tends to shed way more. Aesthetically if you’re used to an alter coat it wouldn’t make much of a difference but if you’re used to Sammies that have Teflon-like dirt resistant coats you’ll lament a spay coat pretty hard as well as the grooming challenges you’ll probably get from it.

The only real difference when owning a female dog is to know the signs of pyrometra which can be deadly and with older intact females being the most susceptible to it (younger intact females, and in extremely rare cases altered females, can get pyo but the risk increases as an intact female ages)."
samoyeds,ffe18br,t1_ffb55uy,1579834070.0,"It’s not false information, it’s just outdated. There’s a lot of great reasons to spay and neuter your pet and many people need to do it as a lifestyle decision to be able to board their dog or take them to daycare in the U.S. but the new research is showing at least very compelling reasons to at least delay the procedure until maturity."

AskWomen,ffbg6hm,t1_ffa2lq2,1579763855.0,"I have curly hair too! I found out from a white friend with curly hair after complaining about how annoying my frizzy hair was, and she told me it was curly and how to detangle it in the shower.  I followed her instructions, and voila, ringlets.  It took me until I was in my 30's to figure this out, no Filipino person ever told me this and even my own mother was shocked when I wore my hair curly around her house a few months ago. (And even now she laments that my hair is always curly and asks me if I'd consider straightening it, haha.)

It's def weird being Filipina. Not quite pale enough to fit Asian beauty standards, too Asian to fit Latina beauty standards, too dark to fit Eurocentric beauty standards.  I have always been really proud of my tan skin though!"
samoyeds,ffb4h0t,t1_ffb3rno,1579751552.0,"I'd have to disagree with saying that neutering fixes behavioral problems across the board.  Sometimes its easy to conflate maturity of an individual dog with neutering because it happens around the same time, but many people who neuter to solve training issues come on this forum and are straight-up stunned that their dog still humps/marks/is aggressive, etc. On top of that, early neutering removes hormones that contribute to good bone density and causes growth plates to close much later, making for leggier dogs with wrong structural angles.  There is an astounding amount of research backing this up and this will affect larger and also working dogs more than smaller ones, and many responsible breeders that write in a contract that dogs must stay intact for 18-24 months due to health benefits, and will void their health guarantee over it because the pediatric neuter caused the structure of the dog to be ruined enough that they don't want to be on the hook for hip dysplasia or ACL/CCL tears (and really, they shouldn't!)

I am not anti-spay or anti-neuter at all.  I just own a pediatric spay rescue dog who has legs for days, and an incredibly well-mannered intact male dog, and the spay literally did nothing to fix her temperament - she will hump the intact dog like its her job, and she's still noisy as all hell (because of her terrier genetics).  Most breeders in the U.S. that are responsible strongly advise buyers to not spay or neuter at the very minimum 1 year old if they need to as a lifestyle choice, and a lot contractually put in ~2 years at this point for pet dogs."
samoyeds,ffb2ze6,t3_esn0jb,1579750477.0,"Scheduled naptime does wonders. I put my dog in his crate or his space (he sort of had his own tiny room for awhile), closed the shade, turned off the lights, tossed a blanket on the crate to dampen the noise, and turned a fan on.

Exercise does a lot too but you have to be careful to not overexercise your dog -- much like a screaming, overtired toddler, dogs can sort of go nuts and people misread that thinking they need more exercise.

> We ignore him until he stops for 5secs and we give him a reward/praise. We have recognised some behaviours and try to distract him b4 an incomming yip.

So while this is a good idea, you have to make sure you aren't inadvertently creating a behavior chain you don't want.  Sammies are really smart and pick up on this.  If he barks, then you ignore him, then he quiets, and you give him a reward, then he thinks that barking starts the behavior chain.  So by trying to minimize the barking in the first place and putting emphasis on that instead of rewarding only when the dog self-corrects, you're going to get something closer to the behavior you want.

It's also important to know _why_ the dog is barking.  My Sammy isn't very vocal but I DO want him to bark or whine when he needs to tell me something like if he needs to go out.  So I make sure all his needs are met.  I also teach him to communicate in other ways, like leading me to the door, bringing me objects, trying to engage me in a healthy, non-demanding way, but that takes a long time to build up.

Some dogs just like to bark for attention. I watched one of my dog's 14 week old cousins who was demand barking, and I realized it was because she wanted attention, so I did a lot of [active and passive matwork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJMdw0GYnJI) to teach her an alternative and rewarding behavior to do instead of barking."

dogs,ffb26cb,t3_esk4o6,1579749914.0,"I'm taking the Disengagement workshop with a working spot. I'm excited for it because this is creeping into my dog's BN/CD training and trialing and most of our trials are in high-distraction environments (outdoor rings especially) so it's going to be fun to work through this.  As cool as the classes look this term, I just dropped a bunch of money on a working spot at FDSA Camp in June and we are about to ramp back up in in-person classes, so I think a workshop is a good use of my time and money.

My Sammy's very first class was Baby Genius when it ran for the very first time and 2 years later it was a huge component of the skillset he has today. He has amazing relaxation, impulse control, explosive releases, and just a wonderful attitude and this class was a huge part of it."

dogs,ffadbcn,t1_ff87c5n,1579732860.0,"I don't necessarily agree with this, but I do agree that getting bathed every other week should be enough for most dogs. Show dogs get bathed and dried sometimes twice a week.  The key really is making sure the dog is healthy (with no persistent skin issues), bathing with an appropriate shampoo product, conditioner if necessary (taking coat type/environment/humidity into account), washing and rinsing all of the product that should be rinsed out to completeness, and drying all the way down to the skin.

I have a Sammy in a very dry area of the country and as long as we did all of these steps (especially drying him down to the skin, as moisture trapped in coat can lead to hot spots/moist dermatitis), bathing him weekly was not an issue.  It was recommended to bathe him weekly by his breeder until 6 months old to introduce him to basic husbandry and get him used to grooming/maintenance for the future.  Many people don't do this in our breed and it causes dogs that end up being terrors to groom, bathe, or dry especially when the full adult coat comes in and the dog is not used to any of the process or equipment."
