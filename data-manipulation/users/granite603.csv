AfterEffects,ffgw9av,t1_fffbazd,1579916664.0,Wow. Do you have that underscore to line break expression?
AfterEffects,ffejmya,t1_ffd7m4c,1579850744.0,How does the technique you mentioned work?
AfterEffects,ff6kbnf,t3_ersr7j,1579629032.0,You could also use an expression to combine the three elements into one text layer and then center that new layer.
pics,feyyaa1,t3_eqwaz5,1579451948.0,Truly wonderful. Great work!
AfterEffects,feo1f2b,t1_fel7u2h,1579293800.0,Heck ya! That’s some serious firepower!

AfterEffects,feky645,t3_epop1j,1579210040.0,Wow. What’re your comp specs?
AskReddit,feehb7v,t1_fedzp9j,1579033747.0,It was a “stop what you’re doing and watch in awe” type of moment.
pics,fecd3l3,t3_eodzbb,1578971093.0,That’s awesome.
AskReddit,feccb91,t1_febfi8u,1578970609.0,"I remember being awestruck over her performance of this song during the Winter Olympics. I’m a big Buckley fan and love his cover so that’ll always be my version.  But, wow, KD Lang was mesmerizing."
translator,febblwj,t1_fe94d08,1578957184.0,Apologies on the incorrect flair. Won’t happen again. :)
translator,fe93vnc,t1_fe8l3zy,1578933901.0,This is great.  Thanks so much for your help with this.
translator,fe93tv5,t1_fe8l7yb,1578933875.0,This is fantastic.  Thank you very much.
AfterEffects,fe7lp0k,t1_fe6uo6i,1578916239.0,Sounds pretty awesome. I’m really interested in the part that processes the data and turns it into animations. If you’re able to share that is. Thanks.
AfterEffects,fe5d7zb,t3_enpbxj,1578867952.0,This is awesome. Are you able to explain the process for building this?
Monitors,fdzqo7k,t1_fdykwpb,1578793580.0,Wow. Thanks so much for taking the time to write this awesome response. I really appreciate it.
aww,fdo52uz,t3_emc9vi,1578599040.0,Plot twist: the friend is the dog and he adopted the bear on the right.
television,fdhxcxr,t1_fdh7obt,1578431872.0,That’s what sealed the deal for me. I can’t remember the exact wording from the scene. But Moira is cuddling with Alexis in bed and talking about all of Alexis’ good qualities. It was so motherly and highlighted how much love there was in that family. I love that scene.
interestingasfuck,fdeh18z,t1_fde1kch,1578338848.0,Excellent response!
Parenting,fddevjs,t1_fdcryt8,1578309087.0,Good call. I tend to focus on the “right now” problem without thinking a little down the road. Then eventually I have a new problem. Haha.
Parenting,fdbiizr,t1_fdbgarx,1578257725.0,Awesome. Thank you. :)
Parenting,fdbfpd3,t1_fdaxsfp,1578256927.0,Oh awesome! Thank you.
Parenting,fdbfo0z,t1_fdba3j0,1578256913.0,Great insight. Thank you.
Parenting,fd9unv9,t1_fd9eh2h,1578238291.0,Congratulations!
Parenting,fd9un24,t3_ekd1e3,1578238281.0,"Diono as far as the eye can see! Thanks everyone. 

Do y’all know if it has the push button LATCH as opposed to the clip?"
minivan,fd90ilt,t1_fd74ouq,1578226340.0,"Wow. You’re doing some great research with those crash tests! Thanks for that. In terms of the screen I wasn’t actually looking for the second row, but rather the third row because that’s where we plan on putting the kiddos. However, you’ve given me another thing to think about. You do three across the middle seats and leave the back empty? 

I preferred the single screen because of the shared viewing experience. I really only plan on using the screen for long trips and special occasions and like the idea of them watching something together as opposed to them both zonked out staring singularly at their own screen. If I had to recall and then guess I’d say the single screen for the second row would be a tight angle. Kinda like when you’re too close to the screen above on an airplane."
woodworking,fd73c6a,t1_fd6i59p,1578198916.0,It came out fantastic. Well done!
minivan,fd7395m,t1_fd71kij,1578198885.0,I haven’t pulled the trigger but am leaning to the Odyssey.  I like the magic slide seats. I also like that the back seats can rotate 90 degrees back into the trunk and you can sit / tailgate out the back like the old school station wagons. Lastly I like the one TV screen on the ceiling instead of the two screens on the back of the seats. I’m still mulling it over though.
woodworking,fd5mqkm,t3_ek1lhr,1578179148.0,Love it! Do you have plans?
interestingasfuck,fccf5gg,t3_egyhpf,1577597687.0,Wouldn’t it be crazy to put this show on for a completely isolated group of indigenous people that don’t have any concept of “drones” or “LEDs” or anything like that. Do it without any explanation and then just disappear. Leaving no trace behind. It’d be a mind bomb.
minivan,fcbbbz7,t1_fcasw87,1577584779.0,I know Sienna is getting a reboot in 2021. I’m reluctant to get a Sienna now because it hasn’t been updated in so long.
aww,fc9584j,t1_fc8ufim,1577547237.0,Thanks very much!
aww,fc8j0is,t3_egj4yu,1577535954.0,What’s your age difference? I have a 5 year old and am about to have another baby and sometimes worry about their age gap.
Charlotte,fbz2o4o,t3_ef2qd9,1577233255.0,Anyone know the rules on which windows and how much you can tint?
