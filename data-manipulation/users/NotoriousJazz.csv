Apparently they've been harassing their family for multiple years using methods such as flashing lights into their windows at night, breaking windows including their children's bedroom windows, and killing their pets. I'm no badass in any way but I feel like after the first pet dies I would be pretty close to my wit's end and would do what I could to protect my family if I spot the Scientologists on my property. Why has nobody just shot them at this point? It's well known they're just going to fuck with you and harass you."

My first main horse, I forgot the breed. It was Hungarian or something. The huge ones that didn't run very fast but were brave af. I dont remember the breed, but her name was Jasmine. She was light brown-tan with white splotches. She wasn't fast but she was more than willing to run straight into gunfire to save my ass on more than one occasion. Pickles... eh. Pickles was fast af but a leaf falling from a tree would spook him. Jasmine was reliable. If I needed to get somewhere and I knew that there would be trouble along the way, she was the one I could count on the most. If I needed to get somewhere and fast. Pickles."
