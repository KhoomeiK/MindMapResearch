relationship_advice,fffmqnc,t1_fffllqh,1579887298.0,"Sure we do... and we don’t get one tenth of the unconditional love, support, understanding, friendship etc etc from people that we do from our pets. Not one time have my pets (my furry kids) ever lied to me, backstabbed me, hurt my feelings on purpose or not been there for me. Ever. I can interact with people just fine. I’d really rather... not, lol."
