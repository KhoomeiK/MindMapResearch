aww,ffk4ddk,t1_ffk3ke3,1580015465.0,"The horse gets fed weekly by a local girl and weight seems okay. But my niece said that is literally the only contact anyone has with the horse, besides her. He has a decent sized run that is bare of grass and absolutely COVERED in shit. He has a small aluminum barn with a cement floor, no straw or anything. She lives in Ohio and it can get super cold here, and that was my biggest concern. Today it was cold and rainy and my heart was breaking. As we left he followed us as far as he could until he reached the end of the fence. My niece said he will stay at the end of the fence and look towards her house for a long time. I looked out the window 30 min after we were inside and sure enough, there he was. :("
aww,ffk42zu,t1_ffk3gpx,1580015199.0,"I feel so honored to call her my best friend. Seriously. I could write a book and it would never do justice to how cool this tiny human is. Today, topics discussed: animal welfare, bodily autonomy, the newly discovered dinosaur (wherein she ran to get an audiobook she’s listening to where she queued up the part about dinosaurs), the starling murmuration we witnessed in her backyard for 5 min, and how to massage the mouth(s) of her new Venus flytrap to get it to eat dead insects."
YangForPresidentHQ,ffk3e7g,t1_ffk3691,1580014579.0,"Re: telemedicine creating new jobs. Was thinking about this yesterday as I saw an ad in my dermatologist’s office for telemed. Sure, there will be new opportunities for docs & nurses. But what about all the schedulers and office managers and techs and janitors and building maintenance and parking garage attendants"

Damnthatsinteresting,ffhhnpn,t1_ffhe8fq,1579935667.0,LOL Also this is quite serendipitous of you because my best friend in HS called me a “poke slut” because I had multiple tips (but only tips)

worldnews,ffhb7nm,t1_ffgy6kd,1579928588.0,"Maybe this already exists, but there should be a way that the public can vote to award people designations like “national hero”, and cement stuff like that in history (to combat other ways history gets written and subsequently taught)."

Damnthatsinteresting,ffhaudf,t1_ffh9i19,1579928240.0,This was my thought - or like the tip (top?) was bulbous or something. I don’t have the correct vernacular here and I’m too lazy/stoned to make a diagram. And now I’m wondering what YOUR diagram looks like :)
Damnthatsinteresting,ffhamx6,t1_ffgzu7u,1579928047.0,French cleat is one of those words that once you’ve said it more than 4 times you start to doubt that it’s anything more than onomatopoeia
