changemyview,fghm8lo,t1_fghek5g,1580788035.0,HA! Well it's definitely tried and true. And it's perfect for the fold over. Happy rolling!
changemyview,fghe6sa,t3_eyib9b,1580782850.0,"Too much rolls off when you pull it from this direction BUT, honestly, I just take it off and roll it around my hand so I can control exactly how much I get and keep it neatly folded.

If only the people that believe in inclusion attend then nothing's going to get done. He can ask his question but then he has to sit and listen to the answer and see if he can't put himself in the speaker's shoes. 

Empathy is what's missing in a lot of the conversation surrounding race and nationality. I was blown away by a colleague who said that of course non citizens should not try to come here because it's against the law (which it's not). It is 100% normal to seek a better place to live if where you're currently living in untenable. People are hungry, afraid, deprived of education, and unable to provide for themselves and their families so why WOULDN'T they try to go somewhere else? If your city has no jobs or if your state/country became a war zone, you would want to move by whatever means you could and the whole, ""We deserve this because we were born here,"" or the, ""I got mine and I don't care about you,"" stances are disgusting. Can we have just outright open borders? No, but to pretend like there aren't valid reasons to want to be here and then be annoyed with people who are here is ignorant."
