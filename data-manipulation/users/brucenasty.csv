trees,fgnxhhe,t3_ezf6f1,1580955044.0,"Apparently coyotes and badgers have been hunting together for a long time. They share the same prey but hunt with different methods, so naturally their combined skillsets result in higher chances of success. When the rodent runs away from the slow badger, the fast coyote catches it. When the rodent burrows into the ground to escape the coyote, the badger digs the rodent out."

When preparing for a fight we would go to Muay Thai America Gym, also in Noho, for extra sparring. They're a great place too and very well known but I prefer mine for cleanliness and space.

I've also trained at Yacoubian. Great gym, very big and open, technical sparring (unless someones fight training, I got whooped lmao). But that's all the way in Chatsworth."
