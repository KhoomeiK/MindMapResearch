SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ffnctgu,t1_ffn4ng6,1580064389.0,I needed a filler.
dankmemes,felun3q,t1_felcrb4,1579231353.0,It was the reason the last Jedi failed and dragged down the rise of sky walker with it. Stupid Ryan Johnson.
dankmemes,felufxf,t3_epsw7n,1579231213.0,Joker should have won.
bipolar,feltrej,t3_epiwvm,1579230729.0,I’m a runner and it happens to me. I’ve been using the endorphins from exercise to help regulate my moods. It can really help. Just a tip from experience try not to stop exercising cold turkey (I did and entered my single worst depressive episode yet).
bipolar,feljtms,t3_epsny5,1579223896.0,The trick I used was always pick the second highest number how about you?
bipolar,feceybu,t3_enh6c0,1578972309.0,Fuck that. You know what you have you don’t have to listen to that shit. Sit them down and explain to them that one misdiagnosis doesn’t invalidate an entire illness that you have it and it’s time for them to accept that or stop bringing it up.
bipolar,fecctsj,t3_eo5dpv,1578970926.0,"As a general rule if you have to question yourself about it you don’t. Try telling yourself you don’t love him, if you really don’t you won’t question it anymore, if you do still love him you will refuse to believe you don’t love him. That’s how I tell but it might not work for you. But you are not crazy love is the most complex emotion it has little if any rhyme or reason and even the wisest of men still don’t understand it."
bipolar,fecbpjf,t3_eo8s8t,1578970275.0,Rant (I have been told I’m a bit of a jack ass). Sit around and generally ruin people’s days. I also will stay up playing video games till 3am or later. I don’t really act all that crazy just like what most people would imagine a stereotypical  teenager or person who refuses to grow up.
bipolar,fecavly,t1_fe94wic,1578969809.0,The ignorant will never learn only grow more defensive in their stupidity.
bipolar,fecamea,t3_eoclba,1578969665.0,I finally told my mom about bipolar didn’t say before because she laughed In my face when I opened up on my mental health before.
bipolar,fdznlyc,t1_fdz4b4e,1578792054.0,Glad I could help.
bipolar,fdyo61a,t1_fdxxmm7,1578781845.0,"They don’t, they are just Upset other people trivialize the severity of having bipolar"
PrequelMemes,fdi0c2y,t1_fdh3t9m,1578433456.0,"I blame the last Jedi it ruined the threads from the force awakens and didn’t foreshadow anything for TRoS to build on which made fans of TLJ mad because they had to undo it to a degree, and made people who didn’t like TLJ mad because it couldn’t do everything it needed to. The end result was a conclusion to the saga that didn’t fulfill its potential but did a good job doing what it could with what is left."
PrequelMemes,fdhzxfw,t1_fdhydr5,1578433231.0,But it wasn’t lazy it had to fulfill the roles of 2 movies in a trilogy since the last Jedi didn’t alter the status quo or foreshadow any plot points for TROS to build off of. It did the best with what it had after TLJ messed up the trilogy
PrequelMemes,fdhzle1,t1_fdhjmkz,1578433058.0,Ok defend it.
dankmemes,fd3yk8q,t3_ejy14z,1578162779.0,Pc gamers realizing they had aim assist on the whole time.
PrequelMemes,fckpxlt,t3_ehlbyb,1577730652.0,I think it’s only like 10% almost 90% liked the movie
dankmemes,fckh79r,t1_fcjy00a,1577725256.0,No because it’s a dumb movie that in no way depicts how being exceptionally tall actually is. Having size 13 shoes at least means you can still find shoes that fit. It makes a big deal out of things that aren’t problems and is just a bad movie.
dankmemes,fckgkqp,t3_ehip4y,1577724857.0,I can beat that I wore size 13.5 mens shoes in 6th grade suck it up and learn to deal with it loser stop being a whiner.
