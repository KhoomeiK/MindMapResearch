I can't say 100% it'll fuck up a save but there's a risk of course. Used it myself plenty, great mod. Manual saving is the safest bet but of course that comes with the caveat of f rembering to do it begin with lol"
fo3,fdhmylv,t1_fdhlfoo,1578426065.0,"Exactly, it's not a stable game to begin with. Best you can hope for is 3-4 hours modded gameplay before a ctd. Save every 15 minutes and you're fine. Ctds are annoying but not the end of the world. I had one save file that had about 500 hours in it and that had plenty of Ctds. Obviously it would be ideal to not have them at all but the engine is arse chocolate to begin with so might as well push it lol"

fo3,fdhablo,t3_elc11p,1578418784.0,"Fallout wanderers edition is amazing. Dozens of configurable options to make it as hard or easy as you want, various survival aspects etc. If playing with FWE portable camp stuff is useful so you can take a bed and stove etc around, PCS doesn't work as well if using a controller though. the mod controller fixes for FWE can  sort that but can also cause an issue where you can't drop anything from your inventory. Reloading a save can sort that.  Oh CFFFWE can cause an issue where you can't leave the shack on th alternate start part of FWE

. 

  the ""a quest for heaven"" series has about 80 hours worth of content, the first part is a little rough but they are absolutely phenomenal. I absolutely can't recommend them enough (rip firelady) 


Point look out reborn is a dlc sized quest mod that's pretty good.


alton is a huuuuuge new world space mod that was made by a 14yo and is pretty awesome.


D. C confidential adds lots and lots of random notes across the wasteland, one might be a prewar shopping list, others are from survivors of the bombs, some might be raiders.


Marts mutant mod. New beasties and configurable settings.


Midhrastic enb. Best enb preset for fo3 in my opinion.


Unofficial fallout 3 patch, hundreds of bug fixes, install before anything else.


E. V. E, energy weapon enhancement mod.


Ultimate perk pack. Exactly what it sounds like. 

A world of pain. Adds various new points of interest across the wasteland with a couple of quests. 

On the edge of your nerves. An additional music mod, get the shades of grey packages, bleak, depressing and amazing for fo3, one of my all time favorites.

Black wolf backpacks, goes great with fwe.

If I remember later tonight, I'll check my nexus history, probably plenty more I can recommend.


Also turn off all autosaves, when entering a new cell, only save after 20 seconds and if you die exit the game, restart and load save, do not load from the death menu. This cuts down on scripts getting interrupted and screwing your save up.

Busworld (pretty sure that's what it's called) is pretty cool, all buses can be entered, some have enemies in them and are themed appropriately, some might have a player home etc, nice little mod"
