teenagers,ffk5okd,t1_ffk5434,1580016689.0,"Glad to know you’ve been able to understand how I think from a few comments. How smart of you. But no, actually, that’s not what I was going to say. Physically and mentally abusing children used to not be recognized as a crime, too. In fact it’s still legal in many places. Personally, I see not vaccinating your children and not protecting them from deadly diseases as abuse. By not vaccinating, you are increasing the chance that that child gets extremely sick by a tenfold. People who choose not to vaccinate are simply ignorant and uneducated on the topic (of course, this excludes those with children who have had rare allergic reactions). Just because they are ignorant doesn’t mean they get an excuse to potentially cause harm to their children."

It is a second language to us if we choose to learn it. A hug, from a human, is an act of kindness. To a dog (any dog; not just pits), however, it is a threat of dominance. There are no parties at fault in that situation besides the owner of the dog and the parent of the child who didn’t recognize the signs of an uncomfortable dog (but mainly the owner’s fault."
tippytaps,ff64j0e,t1_ff63t5q,1579618937.0,"Again, dog language is not the same as people language. How many times do I have to repeat things? A child wrapping its arms around a timid dog to “give it a hug” is seen as nice or cute by people, but for that dog, it’s an act of aggression and threatening behavior. Dogs don’t hug like people hug, and a small child unintentionally pushing a dog’s boundaries can quickly cause violence. Dogs give warnings before they actually bite (growling, whale-eyeing, tail tucked, hunched, etc. There are many signals), but when those signals are ignored, the dog sees no other option besides biting in order to protect itself."

Instinctual desires can only go so far. Again, none of these statistics take into account the dog’s home life (which, with pit bulls, tends to be not-so-great) nor the actions of the bite victim before they were bit. Pit bulls are not inherently evil or aggressive, but they are inherently protective and loyal. Without proper training and desensitization, this can turn to aggression. From the dog’s point of view, when they see a new person around their home or their owner, they are on their territory. Dog language is not the same as people language, and a bite can mean multiple things. To judge a whole breed for the actions of the few is the same as saying all Muslims are terrorists and all Christians are homophobic. It’s simply not true."
tippytaps,ff5yvlu,t1_ff5xvee,1579614661.0,"Those say nothing about the dog’s life at home, just that it has bitten. So it really says nothing about whether they are born aggressive or if it’s a learned trait."

ABoringDystopia,fef4bhp,t1_feew6ha,1579047860.0,"Honestly my ideas are pretty plain and pessimistic. I don’t think there is a sure solution to homelessness. A lot of cases are very different, and to provide for everyone out there is impossible. Plus actually implementing “free housing” and other things for the homeless is incredibly difficult. Of course, there are ways to make things better for them like providing decent respect and some sort of universal health care, but the dozens of possible solutions that exist will most likely never be looked at before they’re shot down. A lot of people don’t want to do anything for homeless people and just see them as filth. Plus, if an idea were to gain attraction, it would most likely be met with something like, “So they’re giving my money to drug users so they can go shoot up some more and trash our cities?” That’s what usually happens, anyway. There’s a huge prejudice towards the homeless and it’s honestly quite frightening."
ABoringDystopia,fedpuu1,t1_fed6upa,1579017296.0,"It’s a generalization to emphasize my point. You, who is most likely impeccably average, were able to find a solution to something as complex as homelessness in five minutes. The term ‘average’ isn’t supposed to be insulting. I’m average too.

You, a person who is likely middle class with a decent paying job and a nice white-picket-fence family sprinkled in there, were able to come up with a ‘workable solution’ to homelessness in about the five minutes it took you to type your comment. Homelessness is no more. Great job. 

In one sentence you praise helping the homeless and the other you call them open sores. You can’t do both. Shaming the homeless does nothing but deter them from getting help and push them further into a bottomless pit that is nearly impossible to get out of.

“Chlamydia is a bacterium which acts like a virus. The most common **strain** of chlamydia in humans is the sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium chlamydia trachomantis.”

Not once have I heard it being called a “species” because it isn’t a new species entirely. It’s multiple strains of the same infection. They’re all still chlamydia. If there are medically sound sources that use the term “species”, I’d be happy to see them, though. I’m always up to learn something new. Just be less of a dick. That would be great.
