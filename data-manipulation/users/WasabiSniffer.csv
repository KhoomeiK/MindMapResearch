AskReddit,ffbkdc8,t1_ffbiutb,1579769463.0,"Thanks so much :) I thought of him as a friend for most of the time we've been talking but the holiday we had together really set in stone that it's a match made in heaven. He met my family and my Dad loved him, he spent his birthday us and family friends came out too. All the family friends that I've known since I was 10 loved him and...it was honestly the most amazing holiday I have had in my life. 

I couldn't stop crying the day after he left. I felt so alone without him. Jesus. Making me tear up just thinking about it. Can't wait for what the future holds for us - I see it so clearly."
AskReddit,ffbihac,t3_eskc2n,1579766834.0,"Welp, he was nice and bought me a bond on Runescape. I didn't immediately want to bang but we talked like every day for over 6 months. I had worked in fashion and noticed he had a rather unflattering haircut and we got talking about it and he decided to give my styling advice a try and he loved it. He started getting attention from the ladies in his home town too cos he was looking fly. That sparked his determination to go to the gym and see how much he could physically better himself and I encouraged him.

We had decided to meet up on holiday about 6 months into being friends. He decided he wanted to look good for me so he hunkered down and even though I insisted that I'd be his friend no matter what because I love his personality and how bright & cheery he is. I supported what would make him happy. He gained so much confidence in himself and lost 25kg by the time we met. I was so proud of him for his determination. 

We ended up having the most amazing time together and even though his body isnt perfect (mine isnt either), we're both doing our best to be fit and work towards our fitness goals. I'm so proud of him and I couldn't think of anyone better to be my husband for the rest of my life."

There's bound to be a free service somewhere in the country. For example, in Australia there's a company called MindSpot IIRC. Free help for people who need it. Online support for those who can't get out of the house, and they refer you to a professional that's in your budget."

TapDancing,ff2gxxa,t3_er7wkw,1579505669.0,"Hello tap dancing friend!

In my experience, you want them feeling like a pair of gym shoes. You're doing physical activity in them so you want the feeling of support in your arch but not tight around the ankle so you can have freedom of movement at the joint.

When you go to buy them ask the person working there. They're trained to know how to help you fit into dance shoes and tap is dance! :D

Hope this helps. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."

ADHD,fem23c0,t1_feltj1c,1579237234.0,"I was never talking about behaviours or coping mechanisms. I'm talking about the actual disorder that makes your brain work a certain way. 

In my original comment the guy I dated went to Columbia University and was insanely organised and focused so hard on getting his degree after his time served in the military. He was very disciplined. I worked my ass off every day to get my Bachelors degree, graduating with Honors. We both still struggled so hard with ADHD and it always takes so much more mental energy to achieve the same that normies do when you have ADHD. My point is that we weren't fuck ups and regardless of the success we had, I wouldn't inflict the hardship of having full blown ADHD  on a child just because we wanted to make one.

We had opposing childhoods and parenting styles used on us growing up so nurture had nothing to do with my original comment."
