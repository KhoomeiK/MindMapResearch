Tinder,fgj2ej1,t1_fghs1cg,1580835683.0,"The name comes from a powerful character in a particular Germanic heroic legend, which has variations depending on the particular tradition (Norse, Germanic, Scandinavian). The name gained recognizability in the German-speaking world through Richard Wagner's _The Ring_ which draws from this legend, and most modern conceptions of her are influenced by this particular depiction. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunhild)

Also, I am not sure why the character in Django Unchained is spelled with an ""m"" (Broomhilda) while most other spellings of her namesake are with an ""n"" (Brunhild, Brunhilda, Brynhild, Brynhildr, etc.)."

cats,ffuo42g,t1_ffule2l,1580246031.0,"If you want to cite the square-cube law, then you should be relating muscle cross-sectional area with mass. From the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law#Biomechanics):

> If an animal were isometrically scaled up by a considerable amount, its relative muscular strength would be severely reduced, since the cross section of its muscles would increase by the square of the scaling factor while its mass would increase by the cube of the scaling factor. As a result of this, cardiovascular and respiratory functions would be severely burdened.

(The underlying assumption being that [muscular strength scales with cross-sectional area](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19026016).)

While you are correct that density is not constant across animal species, I don't see any justification for the claim that ""for every time the volume is squared, the mass is cubed,"" which as far as I can tell is incorrect and also not ""close enough"" (but please correct me if I am wrong). Even if it is indeed ""engineering slang for a whole range of phenomena with similar behavior,"" it doesn't mean you can just throw it into any situation that smells similar. If you're going to cite something as quantitative as the square-cube law, you should try to make sure you're applying it properly."
