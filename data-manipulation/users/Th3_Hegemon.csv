TwoBestFriendsPlay,ffezql1,t1_ffexzzu,1579871585.0,"I agree it's a grey area, closer to scam imo. A hustle would if they bought the cheap ones and flipped them online for profit, this is exploiting a failing business and ignorant/indifferent employees."
DMAcademy,ffe3kgn,t1_ffct37m,1579835785.0,"My paladin has never used Divine smite unprompted, never once used channel divinity. His go to move is using moon beam and then moving it around, or just hitting things with his maul (and has to be reminded to he has an extra attack 75% of the time.)"

movies,ffc0dc4,t1_ffbt1r8,1579788293.0,"Iron Man 2 will have been 12 years old by that point. And ""my powers are killing me"" was originally Captain Marvel's (Mar-Vell) thing anyway"
movies,ffc07b2,t1_ffbsytf,1579788161.0,"You just pull a Sentry and say they were also there but no on remembers because professor X was hiding them from everyone using his psychic powers. Now he's dead/gone/missing and suddenly everyone remembers the mutants. Of course the sudden revaluation that there are thousands of super powered people in the world, many of them dangerous, and one of them was altering the whole world's memory sets up perfectly for ""hated and feared""."

DaystromInstitute,ff9695k,t1_ff930cy,1579705828.0,"And this was after being stuck in place for three days on a ""subspace sandbar"". I don't understand what was going on with Voyager that not being able to move for a few days would cause so many systems to go offline. Presumably toilets and showers are pretty simple systems relative to the rest of a starship, how is it possible for dozens of them to break simultaneously with essentially no provocation? Voyager was constantly having problems like this that leave me to assume they were doing zero maintenance."

That's a weird definition of ""decriminalized""."
movies,fefse7u,t1_fefov6k,1579063785.0,"I'm 100% onboard tbh, I love the franchise, but there's a delicate balance to be struck (Gunn being the obvious best example)."
movies,fedopoi,t1_fecoxxx,1579016578.0,"The rumors were that he didn't want to put Hank Pym in the movie, and then conceded but wanted to kill him, so Marvel decided to do a re-write without his input, and Wright decided to leave (this part is confirmed).

Ultimately all the conflicts at marvel seem to come down to some version of that. The movies are essentially set in stone before production starts because the narrative is dependent on previous movies and must slot into a larger narrative beyond that so many story elements are unchangeable, and then Marvel hires directors used to writing their own movies."
