**The Trans Community is Valid:**

• Trans Women and Men aren’t biologically Female or Male (except for the way their brains are wired “Female Brain and Male Brain” it’s slight differences that are consistent) [See sources below]
One way to think of the situation is like being stuck in the wrong body (Flawed, but can be one way to try to understand dysphoria).

• We luckily have ways to help those transition into what their truth is (such as surgery, legal changing of gender and name, support groups, etc)

• OP is right, trans women are still women (semantics and all that) may not ever be fully women, but just enough to where they are valid. (As stated in “1” .)

This is why I strongly dislike Incels.

I made an assumption and I mostly meant those as examples more than blanket statements of your character. It doesn’t dismiss my argument, but I do admit the sudden assumptions. Hope that clears it up, because I’m sure that you’ve seen these incel talking points as you said above."

IncelTears,ff8hpiv,t1_ff7scwj,1579678989.0,"See? Can’t even counter my statement. You’re logic is flawed and if you truly understand that everyone has differing opinions then you can see how incel ideology  is just baseless and has no scientific logic to it at all. You can say you understand females or you know because of [insert blanket statement A] or [blanket statement B], but (I’m guessing by this post you aren’t a female) when people who are FUCKING women say something that goes against the ideology that acts like us women are whores or sluts that only care about sex or height or dick size that are living proof of all those things being false, suddenly they are wrong? Not likely, yes there are some who are male or female that only care for casual relationships or care about these menial things, but I promise you that being bitter and thinking that “wahmen are sloots and only want (insert a stereotype)” can be baseless. If you follow Inceldom, I pray for you, because that hivemind does more damage than good, and if you think people only reject you because of those statements ingrained in falsehood, maybe it’s not them but you. Maybe, you should look into your self and analyze how much self worth you have, the way you present yourself, or why someone rejects you instead of being all bitter because they didn’t see how you were such a “nice guy”."

NoahGetTheBoat,fdl5ffi,t1_fdjlva1,1578517354.0,"Bahrain, Lebanon, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates do specify an age - from 15 to 18 years old - for married couples. The Philippines has the lowest age of consent in Asia at 12 years old, though Japanese law allows for consent at age 12, but only in metropolitan Tokyo. Japan's federal laws put consent at 13, but prefectural laws vary and can raise consent up to 18 years old.
In Thailand, the age is 15, but this seems to apply only to locals. In the sex trade, women must be 18 or older. In South Korea, the age for sex - homosexual or not - is 13. Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan outlaw sex among gay men, but allow lesbian sex at 16. Why? Who knows!
