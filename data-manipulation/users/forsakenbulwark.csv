worldnews,ff1pmvy,t1_ff1d25o,1579483374.0,"Yup, and the remedy is written right into the law that was broken. Basically the OMB would file a civil suit in the judicial branch to compel the executive branch to comply. That's it. It's not an impeachable offense, hell it's not even criminal. If you want to get nit-picky, you can also go back and see where every single president since the bill was passed violated it with impunity. 

Let's say Trump violated the ICA - the only remedy would be to compel him to release the funds through the court, which has already been done, thus the violation has already been remedied. It's a non-story meant to keep the uninformed on the impeachment bandwagon despite it now being little more than a few boards dragged behind a mule."
