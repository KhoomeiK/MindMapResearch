sex,fgo6o7t,t1_fgo5hl6,1580961095.0,"I don’t mean to be gross but if this is immediate advice you need on how to be dirtier for your boyfriend let me just drop some stuff:

Oral on him: (use a shirt or something on him as a blindfold to spice this up if you like) Drag your tongue up beneath his balls, sucking on one of them (careful, not too hard they’re sensitive), then up the shaft, spit on his dick (yes spit) and then go to town.

Oral on you: Grab the back of his head and burry that his face in there every now and then.



Penetration-

 With you face down/ass up, don’t be afraid to reach under yourself and play with yourself AND his balls sometimes. And back up into that shit. Tell him how much you love it when he fucks you.

With missionary, draw him in closer, claw his back a bit, squeeze his ass. I must repeat, SQUEEZE HIS ASS and pull him into you.

Don’t be afraid to pin his arms down in cowgirl sometimes.

I think I’ll leave it to your comfort level as to where and how he finishes..



Aside from all those basic points, anything further I feel like I’m just gonna incorporate my own fetishes and I can go on and on about them.

Ultimately, just have fun and don’t be afraid to venture outside your norm.

Not only would that be a super good sign to them, but it’s honestly how you use dating apps. You can’t have that icon on your phone that is one click away from looking at other options.

My ex-girlfriend wore my tank top all the time as she slept.

I broke up with her after four years. I had my reasons, it was incredibly hard because I still loved her and still do but I knew us together wasn’t going to be healthy.

A year later she took her own life.

The tank top was given back to me, among other things, at her memorial I spoke at. 

She still wore it to sleep every night.

Now, there it hangs. A piece of her. A piece of us. It hangs in my closet, and every now and then, I lean in, grasp it, smell it, and cry. I swear to god it still smells like her."

But, my approach is this: When they do something you like, make sure you tell them that you like it and want that to continue. 

One time she began rubbing on the back of my neck while I drove. Right then and there I told her, “Babe, I really like it when you do that. It makes me feel very good. I appreciate you.”, and she’s kept doing it since.
I’m definitely more naturally physically affectionate than she is, so it takes more work for me to get her to where I like.

If he isn’t responsive to things like that, then you need to be as blunt as you’ve been. You’re a human being who wants affection and love from someone who supposedly loves/likes you, and it shouldn’t be a tough order. Tell him he should want his girl to feel loved, and just because he may already assume you feel loved doesn’t make the simple act of a compliment or a show of affection any less valuable. It’s important to you and it should be important to him.

And no, you aren’t crazy for hating the “fine” response. FUCK THAT RESPONSE. I’ve gotten that response maybe a handful of times and have never ended up hanging out with ANYONE who responds like that."

And more importantly, how LOW are the lows?

Because every relationship has it's highs and lows. 
Let's say you two are arguing. Does he attack you or the issue? Do you attack him or the issue?

When I say ""attack you"", I mean does he call you names.



""You're being a bitch."" or is it more ""I don't like it when you do (so and so)""?




Ultimately, you see where I'm going with this. It's all about evaluating if the lows are normal lows, and if the lows are worth the highs with him.
Just never settle for someone who verbally makes you feel lesser.

But it seems like you hold your own, and you call him on  his shit, which as a man, I LOVE."

You challenge him and he hates it, yet you are both very similar...

I mean, maybe you are just self-sabotaging a little bit in not wanting to think you love this guy and not seeing a future with him?

I say this because I have done this a lot in relationships, where I don't let myself see me with them in the future to protect myself from heartbreak?
