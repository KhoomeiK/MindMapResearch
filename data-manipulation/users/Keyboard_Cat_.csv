I'm in agreement that TCAD needs reform, but it seems that you have a very specific ax to grind here. Bonds are a tiny portion of what these taxes pay for and they cover some of the most crucial improvements. Instead of going after bonds and blaming the voting public, why not advocate for more reasonable funding of APD (which gets a HUGE portion of our budget)? Or advocate to change the recapture system, where our approximately 50% tax base to AISD gets sent to other areas. Those two changes alone would be orders of magnitude more difference than all bonds combined."

Yeah, agreed it's likely some exaggeration on my part.

The French find it a tragedy if you can't walk from your home to a bakery with a world class baguette. That is what puts them on a vastly different level from the US. I live in a city of over a million (Austin) and there is literally no bakery that makes a decent baguette (I've looked for years).

Agreed. It's one of many examples where Austinites think that we have become a big city with big city problems, but we still have a small city mentality. If you commute by bus in Chicago/Seattle/LA, no one is going to act like you're a hobo for making that choice. But that's how people react in Austin still.

This is all fair and reasonable. But consider that the state has no intention of actually providing the support and resources you refer to. They only want to do the enforcement part, which DOES NOT WORK when the homeless just get out of jail poorer and still have no place to go.

It was basically the only safe way to connect up to Hyde Park. 

When people complained, UT openly said they intentionally took out the ramps and installed staircases because they didn't want cyclists cutting though campus. Years later, Bike Austin started to push to get the ramp back and get a trail built in the open space to reconnect Congress to Speedway. That started to get some momentum and then suddenly UT announced this ridiculous building exactly where the trail was being proposed. It seriously pisses me off every time I see it."
