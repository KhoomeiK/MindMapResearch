recruitinghell,ffd2ser,t1_ffcun3k,1579812290.0,In the early years of employment I didn’t care about much but In the past recent years I decided to get serious and move up/ step back into school. I was an assistant sup. For a couple years before moving departments to keep challenging me and help me grow. I was denied from moving up multiple times because (IMO) I wasn’t hanging around management and being a yes man. Or as they told me “we feel like we don’t know you enough” even though I’ve worked directly with management for years. I told myself if I can’t see opportunities to move up than it’s time to keep moving.
