We apparently all have warrants out for our arrest because the CRA is after us all. Or something equally ridiculous. The sad part is that a lot of people fall for them, especially the elderly. 

Sometimes if I get a lot of calls, I answer and mess with the person so they stop calling. This works for a few months but they start back up again. 

My favourite is when they ask for my information and I hit them back with “well I thought I’m under arrest, why don’t you have all of my information already?” or I just repeatability reply to everything with “but you said going to jail”."

I didn’t treat my depression until I was 19 and out of high school. While I was still in high school I tried going to my school guidance counsellor who was praised for being so amazing. He called me a princess and told me that my problems are not real. 

When I finally got help it was because I was severely depressed and suicidal. It took years for me to get better. It was so bad that I wouldn’t be able physically leave my bed at times.

All the sign were present when I reached out for help in high school. My trained guidance counsellor had me suppress my feelings and didn’t do his job to help me. 

LISTENING TO KIDS AND NOT DISMISSING THEM IS SO IMPORTANT! Especially for professionals. My family doctor caught on to what was happening to me, and sent me to get real help. It saved my life."
