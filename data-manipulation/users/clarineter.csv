You're deconstructing two different ideas, putting them back together all mixed up, and then trying to seem like you're being reasonable and just with your Kumbaya perspective. This is commonly referred to as a strawman. To conflate cultural appropriation with appreciation is to ignore and turn a blind eye to the actual malevolent business practices that people are trying to condemn. And you ""black, white, purple, I don't care"" guys are so concerned with ~~not being racist~~ distancing yourselves from racism and prejudice that you miss the point entirely. It's all about nuance.

Howie Roseman has stated that he will finally address the Superbowl hangover, so hopefully with major changes Alshon will commit fully to Carson again. they had great chemistry when they were both healthy together"
