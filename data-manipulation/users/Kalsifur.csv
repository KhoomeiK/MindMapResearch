ebikes,ffeiiq4,t3_et5g4w,1579849396.0,"It's really odd your kit didn't come with crank arms. You should check the ad/seller you bought it from, because I have not yet seen a kit that didn't have them. Get the seller to send you them, don't buy them.

The cranks are a specialty item because they do not have a spider on the drive side which ""normal"" square taper crank arms do. There are other options but the best is just go with the bafang arms to start with."
college,ffeh95r,t1_ffe7ypw,1579847935.0,"How is someone with a youtube channel a ""cause""? Maybe if the channel itself is a cause like saving animals or whatever, but they are capable of getting real jobs as well.

So many youtube videos I see are simple things that I could literally read a paragraph and get the gist just fine. I am so tired of endless videos for simple searches, it's all a big advertising money grab with Google pointing you to videos when you can read the shit on a website in a quarter of the time."
college,ffeh75m,t1_ffeg851,1579847871.0,How do you do full-time school with a full-time job? I know for a fact my grades would be in the gutter. I probably waste way too much time though.
television,ffeftoc,t1_ffe6eyj,1579846372.0,"Who the hell looks at comics and considers that ""canon"". Are you freaking serious? Man people are like legit insane about tv shows these days. ""Taken aback"".... really?"
CrappyDesign,ffefoan,t1_ffecxdi,1579846212.0,People can happily shoot up all they want with the door closed as long as I don't have to have some weirdos watching me while I dump.

beatsaber,ffe5tq3,t3_et37ta,1579837476.0,Maybe reinstall steam and steam VR?
ebikes,ffdzx6k,t3_et3t9j,1579833119.0,"I would get spokes. Easy to repair, much lighter, more torsional strength. Mags are solely for looks. The only time I would consider them is on very small wheels, like 10-12""."
television,ffdzetj,t1_ffd75zn,1579832747.0,"God just shut the heck up, y'all are WAY too picky, like seriously I've seen some garbage recommended on here and lauded as masterpieces, but when it comes to Star Trek the nitpicking anal-retentive a-holes come out of their basements.

This show has started off a lot better than Discovery!"
television,ffdz3io,t1_ffd97kp,1579832522.0,Androids can age. For fuck's sake you people are nitpickers.
television,ffdyzjl,t3_esoz8a,1579832441.0,Oh my God I was worried it'd be terrible for some reason but it was great! Damn they nailed that. And I can't wait for the next ep hahaha. Don't watch the previews if you don't want a massive spoiler. Patrick Stewart is such a good actor!
beatsaber,ffds4gd,t3_eso5ow,1579827559.0,This actually is amazing if you use vive controllers!
beatsaber,ffds25s,t1_ffctmnq,1579827517.0,LOL is that what those are for? I have like 100 hours in this game and didn't know that.
UnresolvedMysteries,ffdrlaj,t3_eswxy2,1579827203.0,"This is what happens when you have a serious mental illness, tons of money, and psycho parents. I don't think there is a ton of mystery about it. I doubt she has dementia, she likely has something like schizophrenia. This is a terrible illness. My mom has it; my cousin just drowned himself in a lake by accident because he went off his meds, it's a nightmare."
ebikes,ffdkosj,t3_et16jj,1579822915.0,"This usually happens when people don't use the mounting fixture that is supposed to go through the rear triangle, then mount the motor so it is touching the down tube (pushed up) with no padding. This causes vibrations and the motor can even torque against the bolt holes. If you install a motor like this you have to use a good amount of heavy-duty padding."
ebikes,ffda528,t1_ffd6u2b,1579816439.0,"Yea for sure, any mid-drive that's a good idea."
pcmasterrace,ffcxprv,t1_ffct8z6,1579809444.0,Retire from what? Does he have an illness? I don't get it. I don't watch this kind of content but I knew Linus from NCIX.
ebikes,ffcx1dg,t3_esx89z,1579809046.0,"You could simply upgrade the controller, lcd and battery on your current bike with not a lot of work and save a ton of money. I think EM3EV offers hard case triangle enclosures you could adapt to hide the battery."

ebikes,ffcsn3b,t3_eswpz9,1579806437.0,"The law in Canada is 32kph limit (the motor must cut out after this). What you'd want is a brand that is unlockable easily. I've been doing some research and I can't find info on why companies choose to lock bikes via firmware so you can't alter them. There doesn't seem to be a logical reason (Edit: I mean, if it's lawsuits, that I get, but people may want to use the bikes off-road or on their own property, so there should be a way to disable the restrictions). Rad seems to hide the top speed even I assume because it is locked to 32 kph and you'd have to buy a new controller/LCD to overcome that.

[Volt bike](https://www.voltbike.com/voltbike-mariner.html) however says it limits electronically. That would say to me that it is unlockable easily. maybe someone with a Volt bike can confirm."
nottheonion,ffcmez4,t1_ffcdiii,1579802547.0,"I'm wondering if the settlement guy brought in the wrong copy of the cheques. But you'd think any sane fucking teller would think of this. It's a little weird there would be a void copy that isn't obviously void. And who the fuck would call the cops if it's possible it was a mistake, they have no proof at all."
nottheonion,ffclwd5,t1_ffcj09o,1579802235.0,And why is the stupid paper reporting this even if the idiot bank told them?
ebikes,ffcflvc,t3_espm2q,1579798410.0,Can you post a pic of the controller?
ebikes,ffcfdwy,t3_essxl7,1579798274.0,"How's it working? Any shifting issues under load? I have a belt drive nexus but not with a mid-drive. I did try an old sturmey-archer hub I had laying around but I had some issues, but I think the issues were to do with the hub not the mid-drive (I was trying to stick it on a bike that did not allow for proper gear cable alignment)."
mildlyinteresting,ffcerlg,t1_ffc9x5p,1579797897.0,That's unfortunate. It looks like generic suburban North America.
bird,ffcd01v,t1_ffbtvnl,1579796797.0,Just a note be careful when holding birds like that.  It's easy to suffocate them.
Zwift,ffcbvy1,t1_ffc7wep,1579796102.0,Zwift is a fun gamified way to work out. Is it the best way to hardcore train? It could be a lot better if they would add some of these basic features. I mean the mobile api sends quite a bit of information and you can sniff info from the ant+ sensor so you can probably easily do something like this.
FortCollins,ffcarz7,t3_esv1k2,1579795401.0,"Any chance there's a hawk around? Sorry not from there just saw this in /new, but I'm an avid bird feeder and hawks can make birds go elsewhere. How long have they been gone?
Also you can check ebird and see what other people are reporting in your area."

umanitoba,ffb4upw,t1_ffaye00,1579751840.0,For a sec I thought you were making a joke about eating your degree.
umanitoba,ffb4sud,t3_esmfol,1579751800.0,"I guess the main thing for me is the disorganization and delays. Like for grades sometimes I wait months, and some of the online courses need a serious overhaul. But overall I am pretty happy with this school, and it's the only school I've managed to stick with in 20 years, no joke so it is doing something right haha."
