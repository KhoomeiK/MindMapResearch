jobs,ffk4rl5,t1_ffjgksk,1580015829.0,"I once got a job because I told the interviewer ""it was a shitty place to work"".  That made him laugh a little and he hired me on the spot. He told me he appreciated the honesty. 

Probably first and only time I'd say something like that though(not like that place was my dream job either)...but fuck me it's true that some places are just shitty to work at."
jobs,ffk3t3z,t3_etw1jn,1580014949.0,"Yes. I borderline look at every single review and if they have any of the following, it's a red flag to me:

* Reviews that go on and on about benefits and not much else. Pretty much guaranteed to be written by HR. 
* The reviews are either 5/5 and SUPER ENTHUSIASTIC!!!! or 2/2 and scathing. Again, probably HR writing the good reviews.
* Multiple reviews spread out over time that say the same things. 
* ""Lots of opportunity for OT"" = you will be working OT, by default, all the time and you're seen as lazy if you don't. 
* ""It's fast-paced"" = understaffed. Depends on type of job though.  

A super highly rated place (like > 4.7) is suspicious to me as well. Like this job that pays on average $12/hr is a consistent 5/5...sure.  

I have found that between 3-4.5ish are usually the best places to work. The kind of place that has a healthy mix of midling reviews that actually go over the pros and cons, a sizable 4/5 or 5/5 ratings, and very few low ratings or low ratings that were obviously written by shitty employees."

The shitty thing is I started to become just like him at like 19, but thankfully a diluted version. Like instead of cheating on my partner or quitting my good job in a crazy burst of emotion, I decide I’m going to become a mountain climber and dump $1000 into it because I’ve totally found my life passion, guys...and then do it once and hate it LOL."

And honestly it may even work out for him in the end. If there are rappers wanting to make music with him he could potentially make some cash simply because people find it funny. Wouldn’t be the worst way to make some money. 

It’d be a bad friend move to just shit on his dreams though. Just tell him to be careful and call you if he needs to. I am getting slightly weird vibes from these rappers he’s befriended, so just make sure he knows he has support if shit goes south."

I remember when I moved I got a lot of comments from people on my own (unimpaired) swerving, and it wasn't until my last visit that I realized it's because I learned to drive on country roads where going off the road a moment or being in the middle had 0 consequences. what are you gonna hit, yourself?"

AskReddit,ff4c8eu,t1_ff3my6l,1579560200.0,"When I worked at Wendy’s we had a list of exceptionally shitty customers...they weren’t banned but I was told to always grab a manager if one showed up. 

Mostly we just fucked with them and made them not want to return because we couldn’t technically turn them away. We had one guy who came in once and sent his food back SEVEN TIMES because it was “wrong”, each time basically contradicting what he just said was wrong. Basically just trying to get free food and waste our time. So next time he was in we purposefully fucked his meal up like 5 times (like giving him chicken instead of a hamburger) and after the last time he rolled his eyes and just drove off. Fuck that guy. 

Another one always came in with expired coupons and would easily take up 30 minutes of a manager’s time fucking arguing about coupons, until he came in once and my manager threw all his coupons away and told him he already knew they were expired and that he also knows he has the money for Wendy’s (apparently they lived in the same apartment building). Told him he never wanted to see him in there with a coupon ever again.

I think the biggest one is when servers assume the man is paying. This happens to my aunt and uncle in particular quite often for some reason, and I've witnessed it multiple times. It is a little amusing to see her pointedly correct it every single time.

I also witnessed a server ask my friend if he wanted his plate taken away. Friend said yes...and the server also took his wife's plate away, who was mid-chew and had a sizeable amount left. Mine was left alone. Friend's wife was rightfully PISSED."

Because at 3+ years through your CS degree + IT desk job, those places are no longer interested because you are almost 100% going to leave in like a year. I wouldn’t even bother applying to those simply because of that. You should be looking at junior dev roles, other IT desk jobs, and CS internships.

jobs,fekkef9,t3_epkya5,1579201887.0,"Kind of sounds like either a legitimately new company with a sub-company they’re also working on (like one is general marketing and the other is specifically SEO or something), or the job itself is shitty like manning a booth or cold calling. 

There are thousands of “marketing” jobs that try and draw in young people by selling this idea that handing out flyers and getting yelled at on the phone is valuable marketing experience. Usually by saying you’ll DEFINITELY become a manager after x months and THEN you can start doing actual marketing! (You won’t). 

Ask them specifically what your job duties will be at the next interview. Don’t let them just say marketing/advertising or keep asking you the questions. “Is this an office based position? What does a typical day look like? What will training consist of?” You’ll either know or they’ll keep dodging the questions...because it’s actually a shitty job with nothing to do with marketing."

Half the time there’s a problem at the self checkout and it’s literally taken 15+ minutes to receive help. They recently started locking the condoms up so you have to flag an associate down, tell em what you want, and then they don’t just fucking hand the condoms to you. THEY BRING THEM TO A CASHIER FOR CHECKOUT.  The one and only time I bought condoms after they began locking them up the cashier also made a super inappropriate joke. Like...please don’t. 

Also, they totally racially profile whose receipts they check. I’m white passing and have only been checked once. My dark skin boyfriend gets checked EVERY TIME, once for a fucking .50cent honey bun.

college,fee2s8p,t3_eomjwv,1579025206.0,"Depends on your definition of “study”, but I will assume you mean time spent outside of doing hw. In which case I don’t really do that every day. 

Usually understanding the material shows through on your hw, so 2-4 hours before tests on reviewing stuff you haven’t touched in a couple weeks is sufficient. 

For math I do extra problems until I can get it right without referencing anything even once. So that can be an hour or 10 hours before tests, spread out over multiple days. 

But I probably spend 3-4 hours per day on school doing hw and projects outside of class. Some people consider that studying and some don’t. This is also just my experience thus far, could change junior or senior year."

There was no tip line on the bill and I legitimately didn't know you were supposed to tip them because THEY'RE CHARGING ME $300.

Dude FUCKED MY SHIT UP the next time I went, and looking back now I'm certain it was because I didn't tip. Like he was aggressively grabbing my head and jerking me around and dyed my hair the wrong color, when previously he had been very gentle and colored my hair expertly.

AskAnAmerican,fco4lgv,t3_ei7n2j,1577823968.0,"A LOT of homes in New Mexico and Arizona have pools because it’s so hot for 6+ months out of the year. I would say that’s fairly standard for a middle class house in those areas. 

Housing prices are also really cheap in those areas. Like you can get a new multi bedroom house in the Phoenix suburbs for less than $800/month. Probably even cheaper in New Mexico. 

So I think in Breaking Bad’s case, it’s pretty accurate. Their house isn’t super new or large and could probably use a remodel and some new furniture. Teachers make 40-60k, which isn’t balling, but it’s certainly enough to support a family on if you’re frugal and live in New Mexico."

Rural Ohio is great if you have a family and want to work a manufacturing job. Most of my friends who stayed make 20-35/hr at factories, although this is years into the same jobs. A lot of people cannot fathom staying at the same job for 10 years or even life just to make a decent living, but an equal amount of people crave and need that stability.  None of them have student debt either. There’s also multiple theme parks and nice zoos, which is definitely something a lot of states can’t even say they have. COL is insanely low almost all over. So there are plus sides, and they can be huge depending on your situation.

I can’t speak for the cities much. I do know they are not very gentrified yet, but I do see that changing. Probably because people are trying to escape higher COL areas."
