BY all symptoms the major factor seemed to be low test with poor circulation both of which were fixed with a number of very nice side effects. I had more energy during work outs and would randomly actually want to be active during the day. Added an inch to arms in less than a year after years of plateau. Now I actually sort of look proportional. Chest took longer to kick in but it is also starting to at least grow in size. Upper body looks different and I also focused on more mobility to be able to put body to better use. Outgrew being able to fit into some of the shirts I put away for shredded time because I put on too much muscle.

That means that a 400 pound person losing fat is in no danger if they only get 100 grams of protein a day - they will meet all their protein needs. A 250 pound bodybuilder will begin to slowly shrink on 100 grams of protein a day (assuming he eats at a surplus).  Higher protein demand despite lower bodyweight is possible. But also I don't want the morbidly obese to think that they need to huff down 4 packs of tofu a day to stay alive... a bag of apples or sweet potatoes will do just fine.

On the nutrition side of things I would try to have a read of Eat to Live Fuhrman and Undo It by Ornish .

There have been enough studies into this, probably the NDE's really put a spin on it more than anything.

In many cases there are some rules about walking over and playing - many things are not allowed to be touched especially wall coverings etc. But there is another issue - one of the biggest sensory inputs are the soles of the feet. Unfortunately shoes and socks dampen this effect almost nullifying the input which feet usually receive. It has been shown that going around barefoot actually boosts IQ - and it should because more stimuli = more neuron connections usually :) .

At another place it seemed like one of the fans for the A/C blew and the insulation burned up real good filling the place with burning rubber with all the force of huge industrial fans. I got the fuck out of there - not going to breathe burning rubber for one night ... EVERYONE else stayed. We did not have to stay, the job was not important (not a production line) so that  we wouldn't be very behind (and that job we often had to slow down anyway) and yet people stayed and inhaled that shit. Oh I had told the supervisor. He stayed and inhaled that shit too  - although maybe as a smoker he didn't care really plus he wasn't in the middle of it. The really sad thing is that come summer time when the A/C is needed to cool off the place it was no longer able to push enough air because one of the fans burned out. Since management ignored me when I told them it burned down they had no idea why A/C is not working right. As a result the managers offices had almost zero air flow while the working areas had half of the usual flow. They were sweating puddles in management.

This link shined the light on the issue. I have seen a study from also 20th century and other sources in general talking about how badly the women felt.
