TBI,ff6it2o,t3_erw7g3,1579628108.0,"After my tbi I was cross eyed and have double vision. I've had two different eye surgeries, 1 to correct the cross eyed and the other for the double vision. I have to wear bifocals and there is a possibility of another surgery for the double vision as it comes and goes. My last concussion made my double vision better though. I'm also light sensitive but that may be because I have blue eyes. I was in 2nd grade when I got bifocals."
bipolar,ff6draj,t3_ermw4i,1579624986.0,I like the way you put that. I make candles so I guess you could say I burn things repeatedly to help with anxiety. Hope all is going well

TBI,fep7f03,t1_fep70qd,1579313815.0,Also corvel is the worst. My accident was in 98 my insurance company had spent a lot on me. After like half a mill it went to corvel who try to get out of paying for anything.
TBI,fep76al,t1_fep70qd,1579313661.0,"Good luck I've got crappy insurance but they pay for most things, so glad I don't have to pay for my meds"
TBI,fep3exi,t3_eq78ug,1579311251.0,Independent medical exam is just a way for the insurance company to say is not accident related. Fight this as much as you can.
