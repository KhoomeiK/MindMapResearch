Piracy can be a hassle depending on the media, if there is an easier and quicker way to do it most people will choose that way. A LOT of pirates are those who wouldn't have or couldn't have bought your product on the first place so you didn't lose any revenue from them. Hell, there are countless stories of people who pirated games and later bought them, I know I did it with Shovel knight when I was a poor teenager and then bought it as soon as I had money"

TumblrInAction,ffgkg0v,t1_fffczt3,1579908286.0,"I love how one conference talker took one question from a man and then said ""are there any woman or non binary that want to ask a question"" and there was silence for like solid 20 seconds before he said ""alright. Men can ask too"" and immediately someone stood up to ask"
television,fffuo60,t1_ffft4xs,1579892180.0,"Terribly sorry for misunderstanding you. But i agree completely.

Editors and publishers can sometimes have a heavier hand in shaping the product because they believe ""the public will want it differently"" but i've always been a firm believer of doing what you want and people will align themselves. If you write 10 books, it's better for half of them being a 1 and half of them being 9-10 on a quality scale rather than all being a 5. Hell, i'd say it's better for 1 being a 10 and the rest all 1s because no one will remember a 5, a 10 is something that stays with you forever.


Take for example the Star wars movies, the recent ones. They changed directors in the second movie and the new director wrote an entirely new script because he wanted to do his own story and not someone else's which is perfectly natural, i think there was a study done that said that creative ventures get worse for every member past 2 mostly because you are the most invested working on your own ideas. 2 people can easily come to a consensus on something if they have agreed to work on something, 3 or 4 people having the same ideas for one thing is much harder. 

Then there is also the controversy of Bob Iger changing the script because he thought it would perform better in China.

Take for example now Death Stranding, while a videogame, it's 100% just a guy with a vision not giving a fuck about who's going to like it, he likes it and that's good enough for him. People will play it and people will align themselves against it or with it, trying to push it on them will push more people away than anything.

Now if you have a large IP and a large company that says ""Well we want different voices on the team"" you end up with a stew of different ideas that feels like a hotpot with chocolate, gorgonzola and digestives crackers. Sure people might like those plenty on their own, but boil them all in a stew and see how many people are excited for it.


One clear vision is always better than multiple different voices, if it's bad then at least it is consistantly bad and you know to avoid it in the future, if it is a game of hot potato of ""Who makes it now"" you never know if it is going to be shit or presentable, most often it is shit."

mildlyinteresting,ffejmc6,t1_ffehqkw,1579850723.0,"Yeah, it's how induction heating works from my understanding of it. Pans can also be ""converted"" to working with Induction stoves just by adding poorly conducting metal to the base of it. The stove sends out electrical waves which the pan tries to conduct but loses most of it to heat.

Edit: As it just occurred to me as well, in defense of plot holes and ""Well this was in the earlier books so why didn't you just use that?"" (Why didn't they use the eagles etc).

gaming,ff8uw38,t1_ff8once,1579696907.0,"From what i've gathered, 'we' are not the problem. These target mainly addicts or big spenders, sure 1$ from a million people is still a million dollars but there are a ton of people that will sink thousands of dollars into the same game just because they have a LOT of money to throw around, a lot of these people come from the Asian regions such as China, UAE and similar states where there are people with too much money and nothing to spend on.

I remember reading an article after Battlefront 2 came out and this one person spent i think 25000$ in the first two weeks or so for instance. And the teenager who has been around everywhere on the net saying how he spent 17K$ in microtransactions. 

Sure we can stop spending money to get an extra revive or a weapon we want but for an addict that is much much harder and for an obscenely rich person they just couldn't give two shits about it."

Animemes,fek5n4r,t1_feg9vpw,1579193115.0,"Actually because of the square cube law you could fit 4 raccoons.

If raccoons are 4x4x4in for sake of argument, and you put another one right next to it it would be 8x4x4 since it doubled it width but not in height, now if you put two on top of those you'd have 8x8x4. 4x2 in width and 4x2 in height.

So if our anus is 8x8x4, four inches deep, eight inches wide and eight inches high we can fit 4 raccoons. However if we have it as 8x8x8 we can fit 8 raccoons who are all 4x4x4"
