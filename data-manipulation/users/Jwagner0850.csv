bestof,fewixpl,t1_fetgmkz,1579411476.0,"I would agree, but its clear Warren is playing along in this game. She thought this would help her. I'm not saying treat her with disrespect, but its hard to respect her in general when you fall back to mudslinging and dirty politics."
bestof,fewitod,t1_fet6re4,1579411408.0,"No, she didn't fabricate it then and she's only withholding information now. This is very clearly being constructed to be used against Bernie and what he stands for. Intentionally twisted the facts to make it sound worse then what it actually was..."
bestof,fewikrx,t1_fet36rg,1579411267.0,">level 4

This is exactly the reason and she knew it. She could have very easily put this to rest with ""Sanders did not mean that a woman couldn't be president, but had concerns that Trump would use my gender against me as a weapon.""  


She is clearly doing this to bump herself up in the polls. Only, it backfired and created infighting between Bernie supporters and Warren supporters."
bestof,fewi90f,t1_fesrv8t,1579411065.0,"Its because she knew about it and was in on it. This is dirty politics and she works with the establishment. She's playing the game. She knows that if not enough info gets out, it makes Bernie look bad.  The secondary, follow up question, was intentionally positioned to assume that Bernie is a misogynistic liar and is a fake in his beliefs."
politics,fewi219,t1_feppb8i,1579410953.0,"I'm sorry but based on the follow up question in the debate and Warren's canned answer, I honestly believe she 100% knew about it beforehand and was prepared to attack Sanders. She was put in a position to use this against him to hopefully get a boost in the polls and maybe make Bernie look like a Hypocrite.

For me personally, it only validated why I continued to look at Warren as a lesser candidate and further center and more establishment ready then Bernie ever has been."

Games,fenl2fl,t1_felq4fe,1579286977.0,"True but the workers have the power until they don't. Companies know that for entry positions specifically, they can hire any basic coder off the street to replace John/Jane that wants to unionize or just get paid more. That's why these people put up with it because they don't want to risk losing their jobs. 

I really hope unions occur to give some power back to the workers that do everything for the company..."
SandersForPresident,fehbafz,t1_fegtao7,1579113014.0,Her policies are empty promises.
SandersForPresident,fehb76a,t1_fegw66o,1579112959.0,"She started this a long time ago, but it was clear to me when she wouldn't back Bernie as a viable Democratic candidate."
Boardgamedeals,fe4s0fq,t3_enn07d,1578862262.0,"For those interested outside of price, I was not a huge fan of this game. I wanted to like it but the concept seemed basic and not really fun.   


I will say I have not played the expansions for this game, so if someone wants to add to this review, I'd personally like some feedback on the expansions too."
AskReddit,fe4oq12,t1_fe2lzwx,1578861449.0,"To add to this, electronics. While sometimes you can get an amazing deal from someone, two things are definitely a concern when purchasing something like an old system: Bugs and Water damage. 

Water damage is mostly self explanatory.  Sometimes hard to discover unless you open the product up, other times, there are clues right in front of you (residue/condensation/rust). 

As for bugs, bugs LOVE warmth. Especially our little buddies the roach. In dirtier environments, they flock to warmth/heat sources like VCRs, PlayStations, etc. Be wary of who's selling and if you do buy an old system, dont be to afraid to wrap up the unit in a plastic  bag for an extended period of time (air tight) and after, taking at least the shell of the unit off to inspect for critters."

aww,fdy6l1e,t1_fdxfuqe,1578776597.0,"Oh no, I get it. Just trying to justify why it's built that way. Probably hand made and the user didn't bother to craft a ""lid"" for it."
