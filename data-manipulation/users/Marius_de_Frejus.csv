If you DI a guitar (e.g., with the hi-Z input of an audio interface, of which a decent one can be had for less than two hundred bucks), there're several options which can emulate amps, stomp boxes, speaker cabinets, and mics. And there are standalone plugins that can emulate just about every outboard/rackmount effect you could ask for.
