Parents in logging towns in Oregon don't care about education since they assume their kid is going to be a logger, which doesn't need a highschool diploma. Those towns have some of the worst graduation rates in Oregon."
Libertarian,fgn138f,t1_fgmyf5o,1580935663.0,Usually families with higher incomes have one spouse earning the majority of the money which means the other spouse can take time off work when the kid is born. Their hours tend to be lenient and they have payed leave too

Libertarian,fgmmv98,t1_fgmmbud,1580927826.0,I went to Salem-keizer. A school like South Salem is pretty well off and imo the best school in the city. Schools like north salem and McKay are poor and have an awful drug problem and are by far the worst in the city.

Libertarian,fgm2qho,t1_fglmody,1580916818.0,"According to my dad, who's been in the Oregon department of education for 13 years, poor students tend to do worse academically. He thinks it's from a lack of one on one time with the parents since most the parents tend to work more hours and may also not value an education as much as better off families, because they never got one. Apparently they can predict pretty accurately who's going to fail highschool as early as 5th grade too."

There's also a big spectrum of libertarianism. I do agree that people should own firearms, but economic freedom is the thing I advocate for most. For a lot of people in here, it's the opposite. This makes it so there's a diversity of opinions and not just one big circle jerk."

nfl,fg7kxp0,t1_fg7jkeq,1580595023.0,"The pats fan who made the post about mahomes when Brady leaves:

>In Brady’s last 19 seasons he has a winning percentage of .779. The average winning percentage for all 32 franchise is .50025. If we adjust his winning percentage down to compensate for the outlier to a generous .532 (Still above league average) than he’ll average a much more reasonable 8.512 wins per season instead of 12.464 wins per season 

>The next outlier is career length. Tom Brady is entering his 20th year as an nfl quarterback. The average career length for a quarterback is three years. This is an extremely flukey stat. Let’s adjust his career to a more reasonable 13 years instead of 20. That still gives him a longer career length than titans of the game like Kyle Orton

>Brady’s stats are also riddled with statistical outliers. 

>Lets start with attempts. The league average in pass attempts over Tom Brady’s career is 471.05. Let’s be generous and adjust this to 485 for Brady per season 

>Next we’ll do completions. The league average for completions across Brady’s career is 286. Again we’ll help him out and give 306. That’s pretty above average. That’ll give him an average completion percentage of 63.09% across a season

>TD percentage is next. The average TD % across Brady’s career is 4.27%. We’ll give him a 4.4 TD%. That’d have him average 21.34 TDs per season. Much more reasonable 

>Now we’re gonna adjust his Int %. The average across his career is 2.76. We’ll compensate for that by putting his at 2.25. So he’d average 10.9 Ints per season.

>We’ll finish with Y/A. The average across Brady’s career is 7.04. Let’s be generous and give him an average of 7.56 yards per attempt. This means he’d average 3668 yards per season.

>So let’s look at his season average all together. When adjusted for outliers, Tom Brady’s average season looks like this: 306/485 3668 yards 21 TDs 11 Ints a 63% completion percentage and a 91.16 passer rating.

>Extrapolate that based on his adjusted career length and Tom Brady ends up with 47686 yards, 111 wins 273 TDs and 143 Ints instead of his gaudy, and flukey 215 wins, 531 TDs and 73000 yards

>Let’s say you don’t correctly adjust his career. Well even over his 19 year (omitting year 20 because it isn’t complete yet) with the correctly adjusted stats he’d have 161 wins, 399 TDs and 69696 (nice) career yards.

>Lastly, During Tom Brady’s career 19 Super Bowls have been played. He’s won 6 of them which is extremely flukey. The ideal average amount of super bowl wins for each franchise is .594 Super Bowls per team. With that in mind, we’ll be nice to Brady and round that way above average to 1

>#So what does this tell us?

>Simply put, when you adjust Brady’s stats to by removing the outlier numbers then he has roughly the career numbers and per season averages of Carson Palmer. The “GOAT” qb’s career is heavily inflated by flukeyness and his stats and accomplishments should be taken with a grain of salt."
