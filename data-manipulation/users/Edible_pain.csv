AmItheAsshole,ffc3rn4,t3_esd1z8,1579790818.0,"NAH (except for the guy that left you). Parenting is a hard, tedious, long, emotionally draining job. It's important to not sugar coat this. I think it was brave of you to tell your truth."
gardening,ffasutd,t1_ffa2mzs,1579743698.0,I winter sow too! In just a few years I have been able to fill my side yard with so many wonderful pernniel plants. I can't imagine how much it would have cost to buy all of these plants individually.

fatlogic,ff76t4r,t3_ervuu1,1579642255.0,"I have discovered something interesting. Things I consider junk food, my friends consider real food. To me corndogs, chicken nuggets, pizza, etc are all junk food. To them, that's all healthy food that's acceptable to eat everyday. Don't get me wrong, I love junk food.. but I'm not going to pretend it's healthy."
AmItheAsshole,ff5dlvc,t3_erlqlm,1579588453.0,"NTA. You tried really hard to include everyone, and that's really cool of you."

gardening,ff51pkf,t1_ff4o9ju,1579577849.0,"If it's dormant due to being cold, it will bounce back when the weather warms up. I have a fiddle head fern that sleeps all winter."

gardening,ff33csn,t1_ff2qif2,1579532620.0,"It's an interesting plant for sure, and can make for a fascinating experiment. If you are looking for a cash crop, weed is always profitable. It's not always a legal option, so please don't break the law."
gardening,ff330zl,t1_ff2q7iz,1579532373.0,"Saffron is super easy to grow. If you have a lawn, the saffron bulbs can be interplanted with the grass."
gardening,ff2hc0d,t3_er9wa8,1579506147.0,"Vanilla is an orchid, and you really only get a 1-2 hour window to pollinate the flowers. I'm not sure how well it would take to hydroponics, as I've only seen them grown in greenhouses, with typical orchid mix of large bark chunks, light watering, and light misting. Its really an expert level plant, with less profit that one would think."
gardening,feuz90b,t3_eqo7k2,1579391437.0,"Use both lights, because those are some sun loving plants. Good luck!"
fatlogic,feuyw7z,t3_eqob2b,1579391316.0,"As someone with PTSD, this pissed me off. It's my responsibility to manage my reactions and emotions. Asking the world to to cater to my very specific triggers is ineffective at best, and manipulative at worst. Seek therapy. Wear noise cancelling headphones in public while you work through your issues, if you can't yet handle hearing people casually mention common subjects like walking.. and eating.."

gardening,feo7ai7,t3_eq3sge,1579296090.0,"I have used predator mites with success. On house plants, I have used hair spray with surprising success. I hear about using hair spray from some orchid hobbiests. I just used whatever brand I had on hand."
AmItheAsshole,femilfh,t3_epmel4,1579257442.0,YTA. That's called fraud.
gardening,fedizuf,t3_eohvga,1579012747.0,I just toss stuff onto of my frozen pile during the winter. In the spring I start turning it again.

fatlogic,fdjbxxx,t3_elcpmx,1578464702.0,"One of my friends decided to go full vegan, low sodium diet. Which, ok, that's a choice.. He's eaten nothing but apples for the last 3 days. I'm fascinated by how this will play out. Eating nothing but apples is not really sustainable. This diet is going to fail, obviously. Either way, I'll make sure to give him veggies from the garden all summer."
AmItheAsshole,fdcidr8,t3_ekkjwl,1578275656.0,"NAH. Me and my significant other do this, we call it a power hour. Making room for personal time is healthy."

AmItheAsshole,fcmdc89,t3_ehqcrm,1577771240.0,NTA. This sounds a lot like financial abuse tactics that manipulative spouses do.
AmItheAsshole,fcmczod,t3_eho8dq,1577770916.0,NTA. Inconsiderate roommates are the worst.
fatlogic,fcd1vym,t3_egt3uo,1577605332.0,"I paid more to have a bowl shaped chair that I can curl up in. I'm had a lot of surgeries on my abdomen and junk, so sitting upright gets painful fast. Making a portable, foldable chair in this shape uses more material than a basic one. Niche items cost more."

I was so sooo stressed out and decided I'm ok with pissing off half of the family. I packed up their belongings, put it all in their van, blocked them on social media, blocked their phone number, and ignored their screaming at my front door. I have a lot of patience, but I have zero tolerance for emotional manipulation."
