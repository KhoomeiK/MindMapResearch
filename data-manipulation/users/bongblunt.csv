PublicFreakout,ff5q6iq,t1_ff5na88,1579605704.0,"The problem with your argument is this - the fact that the actual crime rate is much higher than the reported numbers, which I wholeheartedly believe, don't necessarily mean that there is a violent crime problem in China posing a serious *public safety* issue, which is the subject of this entire thread. 

The criminology professor in the articles you posted says a big reason for the massive underreporting is that 80% of the violent crime cases involve a migrant worker and are not being accounted for, probably because they're happening in marginalized communities that the state doesn't care about. So while there is certainly a violence problem in China that is being massively underreported, there's really no indication that a significant part of it is happening indiscriminately out in public, which clearly doesn't seem to be the case. 

Is there a *public safety problem* in China that people are denying? That's what you need to prove. It's not just about whether the violent crime rates are higher than they seem. That's a super basic way to approach this question.

Like I said, I'm not a fan of the Chinese state, at all. I'm not trying to defend them. And I have no problem believing you when you say that the numbers are fake.
