Whether it is politically a good idea to keep impeaching is a separate argument, and I don’t have the answer to that.

This administration, and McConnell’s senate, have shown the holes in the US constitution. It demonstrated the checks and balances can be outweighed by cheques and account balances.

AdviceAnimals,fg4sk2e,t1_fg3wmfg,1580510171.0,"I dislike the toxic “Only way to learn is in a manual” approach several of my peers have. A new driver is scared enough of the consequences of handling a tonne plus of metal among multiple other moving targets. Adding a clutch in there on day 1 is just harder then it needs to be.

My sister tried teaching my wife to drive manual. There was much stress and yelling. I bought an automatic instead. Many years later, when I was preparing to teach my son, I practised by teaching my wife.

I watched a few youtube videos on how to teach manual gearbox use, and settled on one I liked. It took maybe 15 minutes to teach my wife, an already experienced driver. 

So with my son, we taught him vehicle control in an automatic, then manual. It took him 30 minutes to grasp it enough to drive safely."

 The only real problem was finding litter she would use. She tested all the varieties we had around the house, but would then poop by the back door. 

We went through every damn variety before discovering basic bentonite was her thing. Now the worst part is that once she poops,  she wanders the house announcing it at 110 dB until she is acknowledged, and someone goes to look and praise her..."
