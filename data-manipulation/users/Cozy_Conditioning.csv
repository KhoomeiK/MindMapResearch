So you literally want the government in your medical treatment.

The ACA (Obamacare) did that. In a HUGE way. ""Free market"" medical insurance used to be able to tell you to fuck off for any number of reasons, most notably ""preexisting conditions"" which means the people who needed care the most couldn't get it.

There is more progress to be made to catch up with the rest of the developed world, but Trump literally tried to repeal the ACA, allowing insurance to dump people just like the bad old days. He failed (due to John McCain), but rest assured you ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT TRUMP to make any changes to the medical system because he literally tried to make it objectively worse in his first year in office."
