Not a lot of it, an old dresser that is f--ked and an old TV stand that is also broken. They are both flat-pack so with my mid-size SUV I can make a quick trip to the landfill.

nottheonion,ff3tlyt,t3_erbflf,1579548578.0,"I believe working steady and intelligently will lead to a better life. I believe putting in an effort to get along and work harmoniously with my colleagues, despite our differences, will lead me to a more enjoyable work environment, which will lead me to a better life outside of work. I believe that a lot of others don't share the same values as I do regarding work, and that is their choice, but that prevents me from enjoying my job, from getting ahead in my job, and from leaving my work at work. I believe that relying on your job to lead you to a better life is not a good mindset to have, because you need to have a good life regardless of what happens at work. That being said, I believe that if your job is fucking up your life and preventing you from being happy and healthy, then you need to find a job that's at least better so you can cut the toxicity from your life. Those are just my beliefs and I understand a lot of others do not feel the same way."

AskMen,ff2zdp0,t3_ercn42,1579529440.0,"Lots of good answers here I'm sure but I'll share my experience in case it helps you or someone else even a little bit. The key is to really want to change. When I quit smoking weed it was on my terms, when I played less games it was on my terms. The important thing for me was wanting something badly enough. For not playing video games as much, that was taking my passion for music more serious and wanting to spend more time being creative, that was being interested in learning Java enough that I actually wanted to sit down and do it. For weed that was wanting to be sober enough that quitting cold turkey and not looking back was a split decision. For video games that was also telling myself that they'll always be there and be a good escape but finally my urge to just improve and learn a real life skill was pushing me enough that instead of other things seeming like a chore, they turned into an area of genuine interest.

Good luck anyways."
