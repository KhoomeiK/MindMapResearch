bulletjournal,fdes80o,t1_fdec9g7,1578345518.0,"Yes! I do weekly spreads as well as a mood and habit tracker. That’s basically my layout every month, I might add in a brain dump page or a favorites every now and then. :) I like setting up all my weeklies at the very beginning when I set everything up, but I know a lot of people set them up week by week. It just depends on what you like and how much space you need to write per day"
