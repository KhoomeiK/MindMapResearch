dogs,ffdbty5,t1_ffcy4wd,1579817536.0,"Yelping, despite the weird recent popularity (and predictable slew of folks asking for help when it doesn't work), does basically nothing as far as training the dog. He's playing and being excited, and you aren't communicating 'too much' or 'stop' in a way he understands. As another commenter said, institute time outs when he gets too mouthy - quietly stand up and walk away (you may need baby gates, closable doors, or to have him leashed to furniture to accomplish this), so that he learns that rough play = playtime is over."

dogs,ffawvgo,t3_esmc69,1579746360.0,"Contact your local shelter and ask if they will do a 'courtesy listing' for you - they'll post pictures and a description on their site/petfinder, they'll check out any potential adopters and make sure that they're prepared to care for her, but until she's adopted, Sadie would stay in your home (it's kind of like you're fostering your own dog).

The shelter I volunteer at always tries to set up something like this for owner surrenders if at all possible - not only does it avoid straining the shelter's resources, but the dogs are much happier in their own homes, and potential adopters get a better sense of the dog's personality."
dogs,ffawglx,t3_esmbwk,1579746085.0,"Someone who shows their dogs competitively is going to be invested not only in the health of their litters, but in the breed itself. They regularly apply objective criteria (granted, almost entirely appearance based, but that does rule out some health issues that would stem from poor conformation, and any temperament issues that would prevent the dog from behaving well in a show setting), and are most likely breeding in the hope of producing a champion puppy that they would like to keep.

If you find a breeder who is similarly invested in their litters, has clear criteria for selecting the parents that line up with your temperament goals for your puppy, and does proper health testing, it's totally fine if their dogs have never seen a show ring. Depending on the breed, that may be more or less difficult to find (breeds that are regularly used as working dogs or sport dogs are more likely to have dedicated breeders outside the conformation show circuit)."
dogs,ff75e8n,t3_es1373,1579641462.0,"One note: A smidge under 7 weeks is pretty young to go home (8 weeks is definitely better, under 7 weeks is illegal in many places, and even though it was only by a couple of days, each day matters a lot at that age). You may want to keep a close eye out for common behavior issues (usually related to bite inhibition and proper play with other dogs) that may stem from that. 

That said, regardless of 7-8 weeks, 3 days is a very short amount of time and this is very normal puppy behavior. You'll want to gradually crate/pen train her (you'll want a confined area where she's supposed to sleep), and it usually looks like how you describe - start by getting her to fall asleep initially by herself, but with you staying with her after she wakes up for nightly potty breaks. As she starts sleeping through more of the night, she'll be spending more of her time sleeping by herself. It depends on the dog, but this process might take anywhere from 3-10 days (and given her age, might take an extra week for her bladder to get large enough to be able to hold it for the whole night).

It seems like you might benefit from checking out r/puppy101, or doing some additional research on puppy development and training - there are a lot of common speed bumps (housebreaking, bite inhibition, learning to settle, avoiding separation anxiety, socialization) that you can avoid or navigate more smoothly if you know about them ahead of time."

AustralianShepherd,ff469nt,t3_erc86k,1579556463.0,"Generally let you pup set the pace - if he's tired, don't push him to do more (particularly when they're <6 months, be prepared to carry them home if you're out for a long walk or hike). If he's playing with other dogs, have him take a break every 15 minutes or so to make sure he's not overdoing it, and try to avoid high impact activities (jumping, running on hard surfaces) while they're young. It's probably not a concern right now, but in the summer, make sure he's got plenty of water and doesn't overheat.

Generally, they're more fragile the younger they are, but you want to avoid putting too much stress on joints and growth plates until they're a year old."

Her stance is no harnesses of any type, but she also seems a bit fuzzy on the rest of it and changed her mind class-to-class.

puppy101,ff1wrdf,t3_er1j6j,1579487945.0,"I think I may have had a similar problem - my pup was much better about long distance recall than short distance for a long time, partly because for a long distance recall, he got to sprint toward me, which made it more of a game. Practicing at a distance, with consistent rewards and excitement, gradually transferred over to the less exciting 'walk across a room' recall (which also got rewards). As a general rule, I don't ask him for a command he's iffy at unless I'm prepared to make him do the thing (to be clear, usually this means 'make life incredibly boring until he does the thing', rarely does it involve any physical forcing) - I suspect this is what your trainer is getting at with the leash, but there are other options (moving closer to your dog, then slowly luring them to where you were initially standing before rewarding, for example) since the leash is triggering a different behavior that you don't want to discourage. Just avoid a situation where you're 20 feet away calling 'here!' over and over to no effect."

My favorite so far has been teaching my dog to clean up his toys into a toy box - right now we're working on fetching a bottle of water from the fridge, and the concept of 'open a door to get to the thing to be fetched' has been breaking his brain, which is great (he's slowly getting it)."
WiggleButts,fedgoac,t3_eodl5u,1579011028.0,"I don't know them personally, but some quick thoughts from their website:

On the good side: at least some health testing, though no mention of OFA (you could look them up on the OFA site to see if that testing was done). Their contract specifies that they will take the dog back should you need to rehome them, and their site describes some of what you'll be getting into with getting an aussie (vs 'these dogs are for everyone' that you sometimes see).

On the questionable side: 3 litters at once when they still have several dogs from previous litters says they're breeding a lot and for more than there's demand. There's no description of the dogs, just their pedigrees, which is an odd thing to advertise when they're two generations out from champion dogs (look for the ch at the beginning of the registered name). If the dogs are being selected for working ability or temperament, it's fine not to show them, but you'd then want some description of their work/personality.

The PayPal button seems fine, since from elsewhere on the site they're clearly expecting you to call and talk to them before putting a deposit down, so I suspect just clicking the button wouldn't guarantee you a puppy."

As far as behaviors go, be sure to not confuse hyperactivity with friendliness - the dog going nuts to meet you is going to be a handful (which might be fine for you, but be aware of it). For me, I'd look for: Minimal to no barking, approaches the front of the enclosure but doesn't jump up, and able to ignore the other dogs from a distance of 10-15 feet."

dogs,fdq7ue6,t3_empy9j,1578658517.0,"A quick rundown of the issues with doodles:

They aren't a breed, they're a mix of two breeds. The difference is that the offspring are unpredictable, because the parents are so different. In particular, some puppies will have poodle coats, some will have golden retriever coats, some will shed less, and some will be even more high maintenance (lots of shedding plus very prone to matting), and there's no way to know until the adult coat comes in.

Because they aren't a breed, in practice there aren't any ethical breeders. In theory, someone could do all the health tests required on both parents, have some temperament or sport based criteria for selecting them, and breed ethically (the guy who kicked off the doodle movement did this, although he now is not involved and hugely regrets his part). However, there just aren't any breeders doing that, because the folks who will put that time and attention in to breeding wind up breeding an actual purebred breed, because they want the traits they're selecting for to breed true.

Lastly, because of the previous two issues, doodle breeders have a hard time getting quality foundation stock, so the dogs they're starting with are more prone to have issues that can get passed on. Hyperactivity is a common one.

There are several non-shedding breeds (poodles, Portuguese water dogs, etc) that you could look at if shedding is a problem, but keep in mind that they will require regular, probably professional, grooming to cut their hair (as will non-shedding doodles)."
AustralianShepherd,fdnk4c1,t3_emawfo,1578587478.0,"This is pretty normal, and it sounds like you're handling it the right way. He's getting overexcited, and doesn't yet have the impulse control to know how to handle it. Having him engage his brain, refocus, and calm down is exactly how you teach him to manage this. A couple of things that might help: a choke chain can be used as a leash extension (don't use one as a collar) to have a bite-proof leash that's not as heavy as a full metal leash - loop the chain through the collar and clip the leash to both ends. You can also make sure to periodically reward calm walking while you're out - if he's been walking well for the last few minutes, give him praise and a treat, which serves as an intermittent reward for nice walking (paradoxically, intermittent rewards are far better at solidifying a behavior than constant rewards)."
WiggleButts,fdnjenp,t3_em5zr6,1578587057.0,"You could try a dog park during off hours (7am on a weekday, for instance). If there aren't other dogs, you can play fetch and run around with her. You could also ask the daycare how she does with other dogs - it's a little surprising that a dog that's reactive enough to be hard to walk does well at daycare, so they might have some tips (maybe she does well with small dogs, or maybe she's just leash reactive, for instance) that could allow her to do well at a dog park with other dogs.

Another thing to try is mental exercise - start training with her every day for 10-15 minutes, and see if that helps (do more with your dog has a lot of great resources, many of which are free, but you could also look into things like treiball or scent work)."
WiggleButts,fdm36nl,t3_elvj77,1578538717.0,"It sounds like you'd be better suited to a lower energy breed - one thing I recommend for people is to make two lists, one of what you're looking for in a dog, and another of what common dog issues that are deal breakers (high prey drive, dog aggression, stranger reactivity, allergies, issues with being off leash, etc). One thing that I think people over emphasize are positive breed traits that actually many dogs have. So if you want a loving, medium sized hiking buddy, for insurance, you have tons of options (probably 90% of medium sized dogs would qualify). If you already have a cat, or tend to have tons of visitors to your home, or live in an apartment with thin walls and grumpy neighbors, though, you may be able to narrow your search by excluding breeds with high prey drive, strong guarding instincts, or frequent barking.

Having boundless energy and a drive to continually master complex tasks is something that sounds close to a deal breaker for you, but it's a very common trait for Aussies - if what you love about them is their friendly nature and biddability, looking at breeds in the sporting/hunting/gun dog families might get you what you want without being quite so high maintenance."

It's something that requires an immediate action plan to address so that it doesn't get any worse, and ideally that plan would involve intervening in the behavior pattern quickly enough that it stops escalating to biting at ankles pretty much immediately (others have mentioned redirection, I've found that to work well in combination with time outs)."
dogs,fd9bsbs,t1_fczjgup,1578231179.0,"I'd definitely get a second opinion on your dog, because a lot of body language is pretty subtle, but it sounds like the trainer may be misinterpreting things. Open mouthed panting, with chin slightly raised, and eyes half closed? That's happy, relaxed, tired panting. Mouth just barely open, no tongue lolling, chin (and maybe head) slightly lowered, eyes wide? That's stressed out panting. Shaking is a little harder to misinterpret, it's pretty much always a 'phew, glad that's over' response, definitely not defiance, unless maybe they're talking about a head shake plus jump and twist that's more of a 'I want to play and ignore you' kind of move (probably combined with biting the leash/at your clothes)

ETA: maybe look for someone with experience with herding dogs. Biting/nipping are common herding behaviors, someone more familiar with that may have better luck understanding and working with your dog. If it were me, in addition to finding a new trainer, I'd start a program of trick training twice a day using positive reinforcement, plus timeouts for nipping, and see if that helps.

There is one part of your post that sounds like you might benefit from having an experienced trainer evaluate your dog, though - if he actually bit your friend with no warning or preamble (no stiff staredown, not trying to body check and herd the friend somewhere, no growl, etc), and it was a serious bite (not just a light mouthing), that's pretty dangerous, and you may need to take some more extreme steps pre-emptively to make sure no one gets hurt (never allowing him to interact with strangers in your home, either via crating or separate rooms, or only allowing him to do so while wearing a muzzle), and then if he responds well to training, slowly try to reintroduce him to strangers in your home.

I know that probably sounds excessive, because you know your dog and know he's not a mean dog, but I've volunteered in shelters that also housed dogs being held by animal control as bite cases - out of the dozens of dogs that came through, there was probably only one that seemed ""mean"". All the other dogs? Sweet, loving family dogs that begged for scritches and treats, but had had one bad incident with the wrong person (fortunately, most of the dogs that came in for bite holds did wind up going home to their families). The one common factor for all those dogs was that they were big enough that they could do damage if they wanted to, and from the pictures, your very adorable boy looks like he's big enough to hurt someone if he tried, so I'd encourage you to err on the side of caution."

His ears and nose also don't look much like an Aussie, but guessing mixed breeds based on appearance is often very inaccurate.

He gets fed from puzzle toys, but that's mostly to keep him from bolting his food rather than to actually engage his brain.

WiggleButts,fcl461k,t3_eapc7g,1577739419.0,"Not familiar with them, but some thoughts from their site:

Health testing - looks very thorough, plus no merle/merle breeding (none of their males are merles or seem to have excessive white)

Number of litters - definitely not just a hobby breeder with 12 dogs. Also not a show/competition breeder (or at least, no titles listed for any of the dogs). I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with commercial breeding if it's being done responsibly and humanely, but it raises a whole different set of things to look for (number of litters at once, what steps do they take to socialize/start bite inhibition training/start house breaking training, how much time are they really able to spend with each dog/puppy). If they only breed at most 2 of the females at any given time (breeding each dog once every 2 years), that might be totally fine, and from looking at their 'available pups' page, it looks like that may be what they're doing. The main thing here is to make sure they're invested in their puppies, and not just looking to pass them on and wash their hands of it - their contract specifies that they will take the puppy back, and offers a very sensible health guarantee, which is a good sign.

Breeding goals - on the one hand, they list pretty clearly what they're going for: low-ish energy, healthy Aussies for pet homes. This is a perfectly reasonable goal, but unfortunately one that's very hard to quantitatively measure breeding pairs against. I would ask them how they go about meeting this goal - do they have any temperament testing for their dogs? How do they define ""medium energy"" (30 minutes a day vs 2 hours a day)? Do they keep any pups from their litters, and if so, how do they decide which ones to keep? How do they decide on a particular breeding pairing? It's surprising to me, and probably the only real red flag on the site, that they don't have any descriptions for their dogs (not even a birthdate) - if you're dealing with something that's hard to quantify, qualitative descriptions are the thing you'd fall back on. I'd expect at the least 'Sophie is very snuggle' vs 'Alex will mostly do her own thing', but ideally which are more protective/vocal/nippy, which ones need 45 minutes a day of activity vs a more weekend-warrior style wanting a good 3-4 hour major activity every few days, which ones are more goofy vs serious, etc. 

Other thoughts - I may be reading too much into this, but they seem to put a little too much emphasis on the AKC/ASCA registration. That registration literally only means that their lines can be traced back to a specific stud book - it offers no guarantees of health, conformation, or temperament. Being 'in good standing' with the clubs means you paid a small fee and haven't done anything super illegal, not that anyone's been out and inspected your dogs/facilities. Saying that the registration ""ensures a well-bred puppy"" is coming on a bit strong - most puppy mills offer AKC registration. That said, it's not like there's anything wrong with AKC/ASCA registration (if they were touting C(ontinental)KC registration, that would be another matter). Personally, if I were considering getting a dog from them, I'd want to go out and meet their dogs to see if I really clicked with any of their personalities. If they then wind up having a litter from two dogs that you really like, then go for it."
WiggleButts,fcl1ep2,t3_ehphoa,1577737714.0,"Aussies won't generally exercise themselves, so having a yard vs. an apartment isn't a huge difference for them - either way, you need to be out and active with them (this is probably the issue with your parents' border collie - a large open space doesn't do much for a herding breed unless there's something/someone in that space to interact with). They also need a lot of mental stimulation - trick training, herding, agility, seeing new places (hiking or shopping both count for this). You should plan on spending several (at least 2, maybe more depending on the dog) hours a day doing things with your dog - if you work full time, make sure you're up for that level of commitment. I'd encourage you to look at other breeds as well (pointers might be a good fit, or other dogs in the hunting/gun dog family) - running & biking are activity levels that will work with most non-toy/non-brachycephalic breeds, but aren't really going to engage or tire out an Aussie, because there's not much interesting going on (hiking is better, since they'll get to smell and explore a new area). Aussies do also tend to be very vocal - while training and enough exercise can mitigate it, if you're worried about excessive barking, they might not be a good fit.  

For some context, my (working line) Aussie needs 3-4 hours of mentally engaging activity a day. He can be bouncing off the walls inside, but if I just put him outside without engaging with him, within 3 minutes he will be lying down staring at me or the horizon, quietly being bored (and go back to being nutty if we go back inside). I took him to thanksgiving at my in-laws, and they immediately said they wanted to get an Aussie, because 'he's such a nice dog, so calm and relaxed!' Thankfully I talked them out of it by explaining that I had been up at 6am that morning with an entire multi-hour battle plan to ensure that he would be well-behaved and calm at their gathering (needed to hit the sweet spot of slightly tired but not overtired), but it's worth keeping in mind that it can be easy to meet some nice dogs and think you really love the breed, when actually what you love is that breed with a ton of work put into it - I generally wouldn't recommend herding dogs to someone unless you plan to have a job for the dog to do (they don't need a 9-5, but do need an activity that they continue to strive and improve at over time)."
WiggleButts,fckzj04,t3_efbcec,1577736549.0,"Crate training is a great idea, and anything with familiar smells will help - try having a shirt that you wear for a few days and don't wash before the move, and let her sleep with it after the move (note: the shirt may get a bit chewed up, so don't use your favorite shirt), same for her blankets/towels. It's always tempting to put everything through the laundry when packing/unpacking, but if you set a few things aside, it will help her adjust (smell for dogs is like sight for people, in terms of how much they rely on that sense). Taking her out and about is also a good idea (use a puppy backpack or similar if there's high risk of parvo in your area) so that she's used to other sights/sounds/smells - you should do this anyway to socialize her during the 8-16 week window, but it will also help a lot with the move, because she'll be more used to being in novel locations."
WiggleButts,fckyzpc,t3_ebhft1,1577736220.0,"If she's not trying to direct you, and doesn't nip/jump/body check, she may just be being a velcro dog - my pup uses the nose boop as a quick 'hey, I'm here, just checking in' sort of a thing (happens especially when there's food that I might be looking for someone to eat). The most common herding behaviors you'd see would be nipping at ankles, pushing you with their body, or possibly a bossy herding bark. 

Whether you should discourage the behavior depends on whether you find it annoying (or if it seems to be escalating towards something that would be annoying). Place is a good command for when you don't want her underfoot, but aussies do tend to want to be near their people - if the issue is just the booping, try to teach an alternative way to ask for attention by ignoring the boops and rewarding what you want her to replace it with (grumbles? walking in front of you and doing a sit & stare? rest a head on your knee when you sit down?)."
AustralianShepherd,fcky3vp,t3_ehponj,1577735678.0,"$600, no registration (AKC or ASCA) - I care more about working ability than papers, and had met both parents and seen them work, although neither of them had ever been to an official competition. The breeder was keeping one of the puppies for their farm, which is why they had the litter - they were far more interested in being picky about where the puppies went than making money, so they were only charging enough to cover the vet and feed costs associated with the litter (you could also tell they were a farmer first and dog breeder second because they charged more for the girls than the boys). Some folks would probably call them backyard breeders, but they did do health testing (OFA hips, eyes, elbows), both parents were proven on livestock, and the breeder put a great deal of effort into selecting the stud they used (they only owned the mom), so I had no problem supporting them. So far so good, although my pup's only 9 months at this point - great temperament, good with the livestock he's interacted with, no health issues.

There's plenty of good information on here and r/dogs about how to select a good breeder, but in addition to that, I'd really encourage you (and anyone else going this route) to meet the parents in person, and make sure they're the kind of dogs that you would want - personality and temperament are really hard to convey with just text or photos, but are a huge part of having a good match in a dog.

&#x200B;

ETA since it seems color is often a price factor (although honestly I'd consider charging different prices for different colors a red flag for the breeder), my boy is a black tri."
dogs,fcjxa0i,t3_ehbo1q,1577709079.0,"As others have said, there's a big range in temperament (don't believe the folks who only have show lines who tell you they're the same as working lines). There are actually different breed standards for personality between the AKC (mostly show lines) and ASCA (mostly working lines).

As far as my pup goes, he's been incredibly easy for me because I found a breeder who was breeding dogs that would be a good fit for me, but he'd be a disaster in most pet homes. He gets 3-4 hours of mentally stimulating activity a day (most of it also physical exercise), and that results in a chill, sweet, biddable dog. However, the one day I had to delay afternoon activity, after a lower-exercise day, he started destroying everything (he did give fair warning - he did his I'm bored grumble, showed me the object he planned to destroy, and gave a final warning grumble over about 10 minutes). He has a sense of humor, he's incredibly smart (I definitely don't treat him like a 'normal' dog), and he's fairly vocal (thankfully minimal barking because we've worked on that)."
dogs,fcjwjzc,t3_ehbksi,1577708168.0,"You're already watching the dog, right? And haven't agreed on any payment yet? I think you may want to just consider this for next time, unless 'we'll figure out payment later' was part of the agreement. If someone agreed to watch my dog as (what I thought was) a favor, and then asked me for a few hundred dollars afterwards, that would pretty much tank the relationship and certainly any dog sitting opportunities in the future."
dogs,fcen2bh,t1_fc6xzdu,1577621999.0,"Plenty of dog breeds are prone to dog aggression, and most dog breeds have traits that make them unique - just because you don't like a breed doesn't make it abnormal. Whether pit bulls as a breed should continue to exist is a separate question, but to call it abnormal is equivalent to calling my dog's herding behaviors abnormal, or a pointer pointing abnormal - it's a silly misuse of the word. Moreover, if you talk about this frequently, you may want to consider that the implication most people will draw from that statement is that dog aggression in pit bulls is not normal (ie, most pitties are fine with dogs) which is both wrong and probably not the impression you want to convey."

dogs,fc8pvs5,t3_egf78t,1577539826.0,"Wait a few minutes for the initial shock to wear off (roughly how long it would take you to recover from a stubbed toe or hitting your funny bone). Then check out a few things, while keeping an eye on the dog to see if it hurts (wincing, yelping, etc). Specifically, I'd check for full range of motion in any joints, and gently palpate the whole area for any major sore spots. That should tell you if there's a risk of torn ligaments/tendons or broken bones. You can also do this when your dog isn't injured to get a baseline for how they react when everything's ok."

Lots of people forget the 'terrier' part of pit bull terrier - they were bred to have high prey drive, and to kill what they identify as prey. Dog aggression is a very common result in pit bulls, and it does no one any favors to pretend their dog will ever safely be able to be offleash with another dog."
