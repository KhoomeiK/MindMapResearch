Half the shit we consume comes from China. We're hardly isolated from each other."

singing,ffrphf8,t3_euscaf,1580162932.0,Find a good teacher and take lessons. You can research all you like. But sometimes you need some real time guidance from a person who can tell you what you're doing wrong as you do it. I made tremendous progress in a matter of months with my teacher because he helped me connect proper technique to the physical sensations required to do it.

vero,ffjfeu9,t3_etwmk2,1579997103.0,"Sure seems like it. I really like it and I was trying to share it in my circle. A handful of people jumped on board but without more or less universal adoption, everyone fell back to facebook, because that's where everyone else was.  
  
I check it every now and then but it's mostly just artist pages posting the same shit they do on every other platform."
malefashionadvice,ffjdly8,t3_etnn5h,1579996049.0,"Completely anecdotal, but I used to work for Nordstrom and we sold Gucci shit. The only people who wanted Gucci were douche bags who wanted to be seen wearing Gucci so people would think they have money.  
  
People with real wealth were usually more low key. Nice things but with less obvious or flashy branding."

Crickets and a down vote."

politics,ffdpp0l,t1_ffcnc6u,1579825997.0,"Okay but what do you define as tyranny? The only time the 2A crowd seems to use that word is when it relates to democrats and perceived ""gun grabbers"".  Donald Trump is the most tyrannical president in modern history, I don't hear anyone talking about taking up arms against his obvious tyranny. He cheats in elections, attempts to curb the rights of everyone from LGBT people to military servicemen. He makes weird and concerning comments about eliminating term limits and exhibits a whole host of tyrannical behavior.   
  
Are you going to defend yourself and the nation from any of that?  
  
Edit: yeah I didn't think so."

YangForPresidentHQ,ffc7onv,t1_ffbcf9q,1579793438.0,Legitimate criticism of a less than rational decison isn't the opposite of kindness. It would be unkind to pretend like its the greatest decision she's ever made.
gaming,ffb9rw8,t1_ffb9lqu,1579756512.0,I just buy up every repair item when I'm dealing with merchants and repair my stuff on the fly between visits to smiths. The whole concept of carrying capacity just feels like a lame attempt to model real life except not really. Let me carry 5 hours worth of shit so I can sell it all at once. I mean for fuck sake I can shoot fire from my hands. Who cares how much shit I can carry?
YangForPresidentHQ,ffb97cm,t1_ffb8rw8,1579755793.0,"For real. I hate to be that guy. But I think we all know Yang likely won't get the nomination.  
  
Are you gonna get a tattoo for every political candidate that inspires you? Maybe make a sleeve of your political affiliations?  
  
And before anyone shits on me, I've made multiple donations to his campaign. I made one *just today*. But we're likely looking at Bernie or Biden for the nomination. I hope it's Yang. But I'll still be ecstatic if it's Bernie."
gaming,ffb8zr2,t1_ffb85e2,1579755574.0,I have saddlebags from one of the DLCs that gives me 110 extra weight *and* I have the strong back skill equipped. I'm mostly making a philosophical argument. Even without those you can still carry a wildly unrealistic amount of things. So why not just take the video game logic all the the way?

singing,ff897m9,t1_ff88vpv,1579669712.0,It's less about range and more about what kind of vocalist I want to be. Is my voice better suited to sing like Layne Staley or John Hall just to drop some names. Maybe I'm trying to sing one style when I would sound better in another.
singing,ff88il0,t3_es4482,1579669091.0,I think my biggest issue is I'm not sure what type of singing my voice is suited for. I'm really into prog/power metal so I tend to go for that operatic feel. But it doesn't always click. How the fuck do I sing like me?
SeattleWA,ff88asm,t1_ff8332o,1579668898.0,You know there's tonnes of countries that outlaw guns and somehow they manage to keep from sliding into authoritarian hellscapes. Weird.

Imagine you hold the teleport button, the game freezes and an arc moves away from the character, you move the arc to wherever you want, he throws it there to teleport. Like shooting biotics in Mass Effect. You could dance around enemies for a tactical advantage. Would have made combat a lot more like it was portrayed in trailers/the tie in movie."

Would being familiar help? Absolutely. But to those of us who don't need to be spoon fed exposition in clean chronological order, the show was still great and made plenty of sense by the end. And for me it's made re-watching more enjoyable because now I can catch details that I missed the first time around."
television,ff6iso6,t1_ff6gphd,1579628101.0,"A lot of people are complaining about it but I liked it. Did I always know what was going on? Nope. But eventually it all clicks and there are clues along the way. Why is being able to wrap your head around the larger narrative the entire time so important?
