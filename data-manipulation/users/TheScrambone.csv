offmychest,ffcem8e,t1_ffccxrm,1579797804.0,"A common conversation trope my uncles or grandparents or parents would talk about was “what were you doing when __________ happened”. For some that were older and now passed, they talked about Pearl Harbor. Most of the time it was JFK. I’m now old enough to realize me saying I was at my school gym when I was a pre teen when it got announced over the speakers that the towers were hit is now gonna sound similar to people who were too young to remember or weren’t born until after it happened. And the fact those people are now adults or soon to be them shows that eventually I will be that old guy talking about Pearl Harbor to me when I was a kid. Hence the passing of time is trippy and me remarking on it history book reader."

offmychest,ffb655n,t3_esi01m,1579752824.0,"Good for you man!

Something similar happened to me. About a year ago during the blood moon lunar eclipse I saw this super cute girl and for some reason (maybe the eclipse?) I eventually talked to her and asked her for her number. She wrote in on a napkin with her name and a heart. I never had the balls to actually give her a call. That was the only time I’ve even had the balls to even get a girls number.

Fast forward to now I just started a new job and there’s this also very cute girl working there. I was cleaning my room last night and found the napkin with the number on it on a book shelf. I looked at the napkin and the name was the same as the sweet thang I work with. I go in my jobs work app and see it’s also the same number. I just never recognized her because when I got her number she was dressed up, and at my new job she’s always in our uniform (though still very attractive). I kinda have butterflies about the next time we work together but I’m definitely gonna bring it up in a teasing way. 

So good luck to both of us!"

Just kidding, step one is getting better at knowing or suspecting you are dreaming. Usually if you have to ask yourself that question you are. Practicing asking your self while awake is just to make a habit of doing it, not actually wondering if you are.

The hard part is learning how to focus your intent in your dreams in to actually affecting them. If I become aware I am dreaming I usually have to calm myself down, and tell myself this is my time I’m in control. That way I’m less likely to have my insecurities affect my dream. If you feel inadequate to enjoy certain things or feel not good enough in anyway during waking life, this is a good time to practice positive self talk. This is because no matter how much you want something to happen in a lucid dream, the smallest insecurity can create the opposite to happen. 

“What if this girl doesn’t like me?” She won’t make out with you. “This is a dream and I can do whatever I want” is the correct thought process to have. The more confident you get in that mental process, the weirder and crazier things you can accomplish. 

The final step once you get close to mastering this confidence in intent and belief in your lucidity, is just having the imagination of further things you can do. The limits really are your imagination and creativity of what is possible. Can’t completely change your surroundings and dream characters around you in an instant? Find clever ways to make it happen. I close my eyes. Some look for a door and envision what’s on the other side. Everyone has their own techniques.

I’m self taught and haven’t read much on the matter and by no means am a LD Jedi. So the most I can advise is to start small. And for most those small first steps are like I said, do your best to become aware you are dreaming. If that happens, count it as a victory and just have fun from there. The rest will come gradually.

Hope this helps."
