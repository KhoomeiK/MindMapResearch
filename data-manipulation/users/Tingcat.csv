I thought I could swim all the way underneath it and come out on the other side, but I hit the bottom of the float when I tried to resurface; I had only gone halfway. For just a few moments, I considered how stupid a way to die this would be. Then I panicked, but I was lucky enough to throw it off and make it to the surface.  


I didn't go underneath or under the water nearby pool floats for a couple weeks after that."

CrappyDesign,ffmu9eb,t3_eu8e91,1580058981.0,This is intentional. Switches not on a string pull pose a risk of electrocution if your hands are wet - or at least that's what I've been told. I think there's regulations for it.

The Inuits are like this, I believe.

You can have medical conditions which mean getting vaccinations is dangerous - these are the people most at risk from those who decide they don't want to vaccinate, because whilst those people are safe if everyone else vaccinates (herd immunity) they are put at exponentially more risk for each person who *chooses* not to vaccinate."

You can, alternatively, install the Safe Autodoc mod which removes its dependency on your medical skill. This pairs well with the Manual Bionic Installation mod, which allows you to perform surgery on yourself to install CBMS - it is dependent on your medical skill and still needs an anaesthetic kit, I believe. I'm not sure, but you may be able to install filthy CBMs this way, though I haven't tried and don't know the consequences of doing so."

You're right in that it's more difficult to remember a menu you can't see - that's the point. It's more effort to try finding a menu than it is to just buy whatever's on the massive ad in front of you, so you're more likely to do that instead."
