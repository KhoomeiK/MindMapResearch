My current clients already want more hours than I will work. I work from anywhere with a decent internet connection and when I rarely am required to visit an office all of my expenses are paid. I can smell the white collar bureaucratic stagnancy emanating from you and I can assure you that hiring me will never be a concern of yours. You can keep creating a fantasy where you're in some position of power over me and I'll keep working no more than 40 hours a week clearing more than you between ski lifts.

Police interaction has to be the foggiest term. Traffic stop? House call? Detaining someone on the street? A conversation? Attending an earthquake safety seminar led by a police officer? What the fuck does it mean? Those numbers could be skewed any way you want. We already know they're skewed with benign stops in high crime rate areas. Your words, not mine.
