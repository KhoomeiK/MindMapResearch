This is false. Helicopters can auto-rotate and land safely with a complete power failure. The higher and faster the helicopter is, the more reliable the autorotation is. There likely isn't a helicopter in production that could not have auto-rotated from the last known conditions per flightradar24.

I have not given up my voice for anything. I meant it when I said that there are businesses doing completely legal things that I do not agree with, and refuse to do business with them. 

But I draw a big thick heavy line in the sand between the my actions as a normal citizen, and government actions. We, as citizens, are completely within our right to judge companies how we see fit, to choose who we do business with, and to use the tools are our disposal (media, social media, picketing, etc) to affect change. I will support that until the day I die. I feel just as strongly that the government should not be legislating those kinds of business practices. The free market *should* keep businesses in line where the labor and safety laws fall short. When an industry collaborates in a predatory manner, then the government can come in and break up the oligopoly.

I believe that banks will get their money somewhere. They will not just allow profits to drop. This means that if you got rid of things like overdraft fees, banks would find somewhere else to take it. And there's no guarantee that the new fees would be any less predatory. 

If they can't recover the decreased profits, then the next course of action is to cut costs. Which would likely mean raising the fraud standard to exclude even lower risk level customers. Suddenly nobody below a 650 credit score can get an account, instead of just 600 (as an example). The situation is worse.

Because that's how insurance does it. The people I'm debating here are arguing banks should be giving away free checking accounts to high risk customers out of the goodness of their hearts. Nobody works like that, not insurance either. And honestly, if a law were established that required that banks give bank accounts to people, we would find that the bank accounts are likely worse for a low income family due to the high fees. It would be another example of how expensive it is to be poor. 

The alternative is a bank or credit union that chooses to work with high risk customers, maybe as a way to establish long term customers. And I would have the utmost respect for a bank that did. My point this whole time is that I don't believe they should be *required* to do so."

>You need to explain **exactly** how **ANY** of those things could possibly create a single second of work for the bank. Although that's already a moved goalpost, because you claim it'd be possible to defraud the bank. How?

Are you serious right now? You're serious. If you can't see the amount of man-hours that would go into identifying and resolving money laundering, or identity theft, or any other kind of bank fraud, then i don't think there's anything I can tell you. 

How about this for an example: someone stole my identity and opened up 24 bank accounts in my name with a single bank. When I found out, I called them and worked with their fraud department. They had to spend their time finding all accounts under my name and closing them, tracking any money that had gone through the accounts to check for money laundering attempts. Then they called one of the credit bureaus to report the fraud and put a freeze on my credit, while paying those fees themselves. 

And you know what else those employees were doing while they helped me? Nothing. Time is as valuable a resource for a company as physical inventory is. A single employee is only capable of performing a certain amount of work in a day. If there is more work, you need more employees. So therefore, by limiting the cases of fraud and abuse, the company limits the amount of man-hours they have to spend fixing it, which means they don't have to hire as many employees, which saves them money.

It's really super simple. And you might be the thickest person I've ever had the misfortune of talking to for struggling with this. Some day you will get a real job, and then you'll understand what I'm saying. Now I'm ready for you to downvote me and ask another stupid question.

I am not arguing for all cases. I am not discussing the entirety of the law in relation to police.

The implied meaning there is ""cops can do whatever they want, including violating your right to peacefully assemble."" And I whole heartedly disagree with that implication, and the number of people arguing that the police can do and say whatever they want. This is wrong. Simply wrong. You say it's wrong, I say it's wrong, anyone arguing my original point agrees it's wrong. And more importantly, it's damaging because it advocates for not holding the police accountable when they are wrong.

The league I played in made up of all my friends, that my wife still plays in, changed scoring categories every year because people always complained about balance. PIMs, game winning goals, power play goals, power play assists, and hits have all come and gone at various times. Some of the categories are so rare that it's basically chance if you get one, and there's no good way to draft for those categories. And that frustrates people. Especially PIMs when you have some second or third string guy that loses his mind one night and starts attacking people and gets like a minor, a double minor, a major, and then a game misconduct, for 21 minutes.

todayilearned,ff4i4qi,t1_ff4aw8j,1579564172.0,"The way every league that I've played in works is there are various categories for skaters (goals, assists, PIMs, hits, blocks, shots, hits, PPG, PPA, GWG, etc) and for goalies (saves, sv%, GAA, shutouts, etc). Each category is worth a point and tracked all week, whoever has the most points at the end of the week, wins (tied categories result in no points). 

So if you have 17 goals (cumulative across all your skaters that you played for the week), and your opponent has 15, you get 1 point. If you have 17 assists and they have 23, they get a point. If you had more goals, blocks, hits, shots, saves, and a higher save %; while your opponent has more assists, PIMs, GWG's, and shutouts; then the score at the end of the week is 6 to 4, and you win the week.

This means each category isn't worth more or less than another category, and no categories are weighted differently. And there is strategy in building your team in that many managers pick a stat to ignore (say, blocked shots by skaters) and build a team to the remaining categories, deciding that never winning blocked shots is worth being a little stronger in remaining areas. So for Gretzky back in the day, if you got ""Gretzky - goals"", then it could make sense to maybe ignore the assists category with your remaining player drafts, and instead build a team that's good at power plays and blocking shots, since goals are covered and assists are being ignored.

Of course we were going to weaponize our drones, of course we were going to use them to target individual people, that's one of the main points of having hellfires loitering overhead at all times: quick reactions upon finding a specific person. And the 4th panel just implies that our military is too inept to figure out that if we can do it, someone else can do it. No shit. Our military is always looking for weaknesses, and then finding solutions for them. The president isn't going to get droned because he doesn't walk around uncontrolled airspace. And because nobody has the balls to assassinate the US president."
