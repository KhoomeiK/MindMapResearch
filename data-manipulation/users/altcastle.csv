Birth is a really incredible card, actually. 1W gets your third land drop, effectively costs 1 if you haven't made a drop yet, gives a 0/4 which is huge vs. aggro and a world of 7/6s and the tiny lifegain is fine. It's overperformed so much for me in BW Doom and can't see it being worse in UW.

We don’t bother. You can’t fight the fear.

But you can. You can retrain your brain and learn extremely effective coping mechanisms.

So no, I’m not hating on them, but they’re not inherently the best of the best because our understanding of how to deal with fear/avoidance was flawed. What they were were totally capable of not having that initial or built later part and then also capable.

I hope my point is clear in that the astronaut program probably kicked a lot of EXTREMELY excellent people out because they didn’t bother to understand how brains work.

Just sucks that some people may have had a brief event that could’ve been surmounted and they would’ve been amazing but they were self selecting for not that because they couldn’t be bothered to look further.

The deck needs to draw cards when it grinds and this does it better than Liliana plus is also great at targeting the non-creature permanents. When you’re playing both of those, cav and ugin, your win percentage will really rise.

From there, I am experimenting with the 3/4 Pegasus that makes more. It’s certainly good in the sideboard, I have one main because people won’t expect it and it’s a credible wincon as it usually is 5-7 power in the air ASAP that lifelinks so it closes faster than Cavalier.

But all of this together is just incredibly powerful. I can answer any permanent, literally any of them, and don’t really care about the destruction of my own as my plan was to sacrifice them anyway.

Treacherous Blessing has been very good.

I vastly prefer the White Castle after many games to the black one. I dunno if that’s just variance but I need to make guys and win more than I need to take damage to draw. But I tend to have a very healthy life total."

Your friends were just driven/pressured to follow one path no matter what, there’s little evidence they will like their careers or stick with them as evidence is in abundance that selecting a career so early leads to poor fit (because lol of course) unless you’re exceptionally lucky.

People who zig zag start slower but end up just the same if not higher in the end.

Read Range by David Epstein if your post was serious and not a humble brag. It’s super obvious that we think early specialization is best when it’s so tragically incorrect for this world that not prizes flexible thinking and adaptation above all else."
personalfinance,fefwaku,t1_fef4m3z,1579067285.0,"Depends how much student debt they have. I have 0 and made 52k by 32 but have been fairly stagnate since then. Going to transition to data via grad school now.

55k is nothing if you have six figures of student debt weighing you down, but it’s totally fine for me right now with no debt beyond a 4K car loan on a car valued at 10k. But I’ll be paying for grad school classes so that’ll be something."

financialindependence,fedj3l3,t1_fedhxhl,1579012820.0,"Then for you it's fine. Normal human function has us focusing far, far, far more on negative feedback than positive. So I'm explaining that to the majority of people who obsessively look at stuff for awhile and wonder why it's making them feel so bad."

financialindependence,fecnaa0,t1_fecgbnu,1578978188.0,"Because you want to feel in control but paradoxically are doing the opposite to yourself. I’m reading The Power of Bad right now and it’s a useful tutorial on why less is more once you automate the stuff correctly. Negative stimulus is far more powerful than positive because that’s how you survive, but that’s painfully outdated in this world most times.

If you’re set up and good to go, just let it all fall away besides maybe a regular check you have scheduled like the guy who puts it in a spreadsheet monthly.

Seriously, dwelling on it isn’t doing anything but you’re using it as a source of feedback that’s not positive."
