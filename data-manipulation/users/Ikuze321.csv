There would be obvious signs of distortion with a wide angle lens positioned close to the subject, which is what would have to here to cause any significant amount of perspective distortion to make their heights appear off in relation to each other."
AbsoluteUnits,fffy1h5,t1_fffxx2w,1579894290.0,"No, it's not. If it was a wide enough angle lens it might be. But it's not, because you'd have to be so close to those people in the front for them to be this large in the photo that there'd be a lot of distortion showing"

It started about 5 years ago when I went on vacation with some friends and I bought a film camera at a garage sale. I had no plans to actually use it, but I did and I ended up really liking it. It's funny because I was already in school for my degree, and it just happened to be the perfect degree for making film, and I'm applying for a job to do that now. Here are some photos I took on medium format cameras, and some near infrared photos too. I always use the hashtag asmallredradio on Instagram, so if you search it you'll see more.
