getdisciplined,fepi5wp,t1_felzmbh,1579321117.0,"I began my morning schedule a few years ago when I decided I wanted to run a marathon. As the training season went on, my runs got longer and longer and I was forced to wake up earlier and earlier to fit them in. Here I started to really enjoy my mornings and I saw how refreshing and peaceful they can be (It got easier the longer I stuck with my bedtime/wake-time - I fell asleep more easily and woke up easily).

Now, I don't train for marathons but I still value running and try to jog every morning. It's always refreshing and it centers my thoughts if I feel anxious when I wake up - it's dependable. Then I shower, eat, and chill in my room. Ill meditate or clean my room.

**The most important thing is consistency.** Pick a bedtime, pick a wake time and stick with it. The longer you stay with it, the more solid your circadian rhythm will be.

**Wake up for a reason.** Make sure you are waking up to do something, not just to wake up earlier. If you wake up early  just to wake up earlier you'll end up sitting on your bed for a minute then lying back down. I wake up early so i can fit in a run.

**Be smart with your alarms.** Your alarms are important and should be dependable (and loud). 

Besides being calmer in the mornings, it also helps with sleep! It solidifies your sleep patterns, and lets your body settle into a bedtime when it's actually expecting it. Life is too short to get horrible sleep and not be calm. I would also highly recommend mindfulness meditation :)"

getdisciplined,felwlbh,t1_fela4gf,1579232752.0,"This might sound like a horrible suggestion on first glance, but you should try waking up earlier and using the morning as your alone time. Morning alone time is on another level of peaceful. Give it enough of a try for your body to adjust so you can actually see if you like it. 
(you don‚Äôt have to if you don‚Äôt want it‚Äôs just a suggestion. i‚Äôve tried doing mornings and i love it and i‚Äôm introverted as hell too ‚úåüèº)"

BirdsArentReal,fehsycq,t3_ep0535,1579123247.0,"I was in a therapy session one time last year shortly after I put my dog down. I was talking about it with my therapist and he asked if he could see some pictures of him. I handed him my phone with an album of my pup and he looked through all of them deliberately, while making comments about how cute he is etc. After the session I was looking through that album and realized there was a picture that didn‚Äôt belong. It was this picture... 
He didn‚Äôt say anything about it but I really wonder what he thought when he saw it."
