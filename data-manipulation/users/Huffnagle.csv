People are talking about how a heat bill couldn’t be $1k, well it can.

There are 2 common reasons for shocking heat bills. One is really poor insulation. There are steps you can take to improve the insulation if thats the case.

The other is a problem with the furnace. One problem in particular... The electric heat pump will sometimes malfunction to where the outside unit isn’t working and the furnace runs purely on the emergency element. This will get you an electric bill at or nearing $1k/month. 

For those unfamiliar; A geothermal heat pump runs lines underground to pull heat from the earth. That’s not the one I’m talking about.
An electric heat pump literally runs the air conditioner backwards to pull heat from the colder air outside. In some cases, they can be fairly efficient, but when they break and only run on the electric heating element, your wallet will cry."
fatlogic,ffbwd91,t1_ffbg1yk,1579784953.0,"One teensy problem with that.

Nobody actually does it, yet plenty of people (and more every day) are sticking to Keto diets and watching their health improve. 

Now... You will never find me saying that Keto is the only way to lose weight, that would clearly be incorrect. 

But, it’s becoming more and more clear that people (real people living real lives) are finding success with Keto that they never found eating high carb diets. The how’s and why’s could be debated, but the fact that people are experiencing a newfound success is incontrovertible. 
It’s also becoming clear that the Chicken Littles telling us the Keto sky is falling are completely wrong. People are finding success and renewed heath with the low carb way of eating. 

And... You mention the “severely obese”.
I’ve never been that, maybe 40# overweight as a pretty active and reasonably fit person. The Keto way of eating has vastly improved my heath. My doctor is happy with my numbers, I’m not sure why some people are so keen to disparage low carb diets."

Come to the Easyriders Rodeo in Chillicothe over Labor Day weekend. You can walk around naked all weekend if you want, you’ll have plenty of other girls doing it, and lots of guys enjoying the show.
And alcohol... 

It’s a hell of a party!"
AskAnAmerican,ffaym4y,t1_ffarzxp,1579747508.0,"Carmel is a bedroom community and suburb of Indianapolis. There is some industry, but not that much.

Now, I’m a white guy, but I live about a mile from Carmel. I worked in Carmel for a long time. Let’s say I’m familiar with the place.

So... A lot of times statistics get twisted and can be misleading. This isn’t one of those times. That statistic means exactly what it looks like it means."
fatlogic,ffax95r,t1_ffa82yo,1579746611.0,"You’re absolutely right, the experts say Keto is bad for your health in all sorts of ways. The 7 Countries Study is their bible.  (Too bad Ancel Keys actually studied a bunch more countries than that but committed research fraud by burying that fact)

But, there’s one teensy inconvenient problem... People keep getting healthier. They go on Keto, lose weight and get healthier in every measurable way. Their blood pressure goes down, their triglycerides go down, their A1c goes down. They reduce or entirely get off their blood pressure and (type 2) diabetes meds.  But it’s bad for you. 

Fortunately for me, my personal doctor is very happy with my labs and enthusiastically supports keto."
fatlogic,ffa5pts,t1_ff9yy88,1579728400.0,"There is no doubt that carbs are useful for competitive athletes. 

I’m not convinced that it matters for a weekend warrior who’s doing it for the exercise and is not worried about times. Will they be faster? Yes, usually. Does it matter? Maybe not."
fatlogic,ff9sws8,t1_ff9sdkx,1579720545.0,"So the Inuit have a wide range of problems? Expand on that.

And of course I didn’t suggest immortality, that’s a hell of a straw man argument.

I said that there is no such thing as an essential carbohydrate. Please review what the word essential means in the context of nutrition."
fatlogic,ff9r8ff,t1_ff9qg66,1579719314.0,"Not necessarily. 
You can be keto while eating no carbohydrates. Most people eating keto are getting some, but that isn’t necessary. 

I see I’m being downvoted, whatever... The truth is the truth. There is no such thing as an essential carbohydrate. The human body can make everything it needs to thrive indefinitely without any carbs."
fatlogic,ff8vfzi,t1_ff8v5b7,1579697438.0,"We do not “need” any sugar whatsoever. 
People can live healthy lives for years on strict keto diets, there is no such thing as an essential carbohydrate. 

That said... If you haven’t screwed up your metabolism, if you haven’t gotten fat... Eating some sugar (moderation) probably isn’t particularly bad for you."
bicycletouring,ff4huse,t3_erj3kf,1579563983.0,I went on a 6 day organized tour last summer at 52. I was the youngest guy in my group. The oldest guy in our group was 82. He rode every foot of every day.
RedPillWomen,fekidy3,t1_fejlhei,1579200677.0,"One of the core tenets of TRP really applies to you. 
You may not have been dealt the best hand, but it’s the hand you have. You can give up, or you can make the best of it and improve the things that you can. 

Simple fact: Most of your classmates are going to get fat. By the time you’re 23, they will be getting thicker. Just by staying (becoming) lean and fit, you will pass many of them. 

Stay away from sugar, take up yoga, learn to dress, learn makeup, learn feminine behavior and mannerisms. 

Easy? No. But these things are in your power to do."
