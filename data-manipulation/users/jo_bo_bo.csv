My friend is planning to bring food.  I have one that I for sure trust to cook for me.  She's a chef and very conscious of allergies.  I heard stories of nurses practically insisting ladies eat their jello.  I plan on having signs on the walls everywhere to remind people.  I'm not bashful!"
AskReddit,fgm18o3,t1_fgm0xc3,1580915864.0,Thanks! I just wish more people knew about it.  I'm pregnant and will have to figure out how to get food that's safe for me when I'm at the hospital.  I don't trust them.  They barely have gluten free options most of the time.
AskReddit,fglzx5n,t1_fglz9ae,1580914998.0,"Haha! Poultry and seafood.  Not a huge fan of seafood myself.   I eat a lot of chicken and turkey. Also have eggs for breakfast. Missing dairy makes it the hardest, because there are so many good gluten free things if you can have cheese or cream on/with it. 

When we have luck hunting we eat duck and goose too.

I hear emu is pretty good, but I've never tried it.

You learn to adapt.  I don't want to be negative about it, I do get frustrated though. 

What really sucks is that my husband and I were planning to raise meat goats to try and be as self sufficient as possible, and I had a good portion of half a pig in the freezer when I got diagnosed. 

I had to quit cooking it for my husband because I had digestive issues every time I did. I don't think it was the fumes, but the food splattering into the food I cooked for me.  I've been much better since I quit cooking that stuff for him."
AskReddit,fglu7nq,t1_fgltmcw,1580911042.0,Yes! I forgot about carrageenan.  I was telling a coworker about that yesterday.
AskReddit,fglstr0,t1_fglsn6x,1580910080.0,"Yes! Vegan, gluten free makeup and skin care?  This is just ridiculous.

Lots of people with alpha gal have reactions just to meat cooking.  It's nuts."
AskReddit,fglre40,t1_fglb5l6,1580908956.0,"Alpha gal and wheat and dairy allergies here.... 

Butter.  Anything made with butter won't work either.

Cross contaminated food at restaurants, so I can't eat out. 

Gelatin and tons of medications and vitamin supplements as well.  Can't take pills in capsules.  Turned out my prenatal tablet also had gelatin in it.  I have to find vegan vitamins to take.

Also, many vaccines are grown in pork cells. I had to research and make sure the flu shot was one of the 3 that were safe."
Aug2020bumpers,fgjcgif,t3_eyu31s,1580841143.0,My work pays 60% for 6 weeks of short term disability after we use 40 hours of vacation time.  I plan to take the full 12 weeks FMLA allows and just not get paid.
Aug2020bumpers,fgh8wkg,t3_eygqjn,1580779426.0,"I'm 5'3"" and I got some skinny maternity pants from motherhood maternity, they are large petite and they are about an inch too short for me. Indigo blue is the brand.  I'm built muscular/stocky with a little flab and they fit great."
