Even the very first pic I googled of the open tropical ocean looks almost clear if you take out  the reflection from the sky and certainly not turvy. It depends on many factors but with the type of  rough-grained sand shown, no disturbance and it being so shallow, that what it looks like. I Googled a little because I'm too insecure but the first hit with clear puddle shows a long to stpckpicture with more than 1000 that look almost the same..."
SuicideWatch,ffjik43,t1_ffjgtqe,1579999007.0,I'm sorry if my english is bad but the only way I sent off anything is to do it quickly because otherwise I take so long debating what I should write that I never sent it off.
SuicideWatch,ffjgtqe,t1_ffifw8l,1579997943.0,I hope it helped a little. Do you want to engage a little?
pics,ffij48e,t1_ffi68bq,1579975094.0,I googled a little and apparently few rodents were ever found that carried it including squirrels and no transfer has been recorded. The reason seems to be that the main rabies hosts are predators and rodents don't tend to survive a bite from them and they aren't among the incubators of rabies. No research seems to have been done on the possibility because of the unlikelhood but I wouldn't say it could never happen..
pics,ffidect,t1_ffi68bq,1579971211.0,I just wanted to thank you for the knowledge but I started wondering.. Who is saying that and how do they know?
OutOfTheLoop,ffi5k4f,t1_fffkya5,1579965666.0,"He thinks that there if a difference between someone born a woman and trans-gender woman and he thinks that transgender woman who transitioned very late so their anatomy were profiting from the heightened level of male hormones have an unfair advantage in professional sports that require high athletic capability when performing with woman who never had a body producing male hormones for a long time. Thats fucking  it and that he dares to treat the lgbtq community like everyone else by making fun of the most extreme members. Fucking idiots.. I stopped watching him regularly and I disagree with half he says but I am sure that outside the most extreme people who believer gender identy replaced sex while both are real and have to be true because otherwise the entire body dismorphia stops making sense. 1,7 % of people are born intersex so this entire debate doesn't make sense to me because nature is just more complicated than we think and all those label only have meaning in context with other things."

SuicideWatch,ffhgtt1,t3_etebjg,1579934630.0,I feel pathetic as hell but thanks for letting me know that there are always people like you. I'm sorry. I know you don't want to talk but you are because you are scared and can't think of anything to do. I'm sorry. Yiu are right that I could not care less about you personally but I do greatly care that people suffer and I also know that you do need to tall because that is what you are doing in a rather ironic way.
SuicideWatch,ffhfgzr,t3_etexyo,1579933035.0,"That is 100% what I feel like bit I'm too scared to die even though I think that it would now be the rational thing to do. Here is why I don't.. I know things can get better just like you probably do too  but I don't see how I could get out. What I realised though is that after a mostly miserable life, I keep pulling through things that progressively get worse evn though Im always convinced that I couldn't endure even a minimal turn for the worse. I'm now at the point where I don't have the energy to do what I have to in case all the help I seeked fails and I might just crack soon but I might get lucky.. Whatever mental illness you have, its just part of what 3 dimensional human being you are and instead of seeking to be good, just try to be motivated to do what you can to improve. Don't tell yourself that you'll fail. Try it. If you fail and can't cope you'll always have a last option but you might as well fight the bad parts of you just to try. Things can always get worse and better and part of becoming stronger and better is just giving yourself the chance in the first place. I feel with you. We are not alone."
europe,ffhenx8,t1_fffh75e,1579932122.0,"No worries. I caught that but tried to witty. I misremembered jones as the animator of the pythons and if heaven and god are anything like they showed than Terry would not appreciate the ""rest in peace"" because hell be resting of in pieces as card-board god probably but of his head.

SuicideWatch,ffghmt6,t3_eth6bt,1579906437.0,"Some people don't know how to help, most like your family have their own personal mental problems like not being able to express love by concern but by ""forcefully helping"" like making little statements because many think that mental health is all up to you alone and some profesional so they nag you to ""man up"", while we are social animals. All those people that you love and dislike  because we are all flawed will miss you. I would miss the blank idea of who you are because I know that you feel the same emotions as I do. I also think that no one would miss me my eternal mantra being: Im alone. I have no one. I have nothing. I am nothing. 
But I also know that we are wrong. 
I can't imagine your pain just like you can't imagine what it's like to not have had any relationship for half your life and being certain that that is completely impossible. That is mostly because I'm too scared to be hurt again and experiencing what you did would probably have been too much so I thank you for proving to me that you can fight and live with issues I believe I couldn't deal with. I really messed up with the family and you seem to share the recentment I feel for being recented1. They did many things wrong, completely messed me up really. But they were messed up in turn themselves.. I have not talked to any family or friends in month after it completely escalated and I was convinced that no one would miss me. Until the social worker who is taking care off me told mevtaday that they call her every week to make sure I'm all right. They don't care enough to get me off the streets and I am definitely not allright(I have a room at an hotel but that's over in a week and worth out the adresse I won't have an income so yeah..) but I know they would miss me just like I know that many people would miss you. Ive been socially secluding myself for years, I have huge self-esteem issues and Ive been abused although never by a long-time partner because I never had one, so I mighp after all exactly what you are going true. I know it can get better and I know you can pull through because I could never have imagined to suffer through what I do now. I ended up homeless because I felt exactly what you do after I was forced to move back in with family for what I thought were months and finally escalated a big fight I started to force myself into suicide. I couldn't because I know that all my problems and issues can be improved and I just need to get the right help. If I don't than I won't live much longer anyways as my batteries are dead but if I find what I need  than I'll live and I will be happy again. I wish you all the best. You can talk to me if you like although I don't have many answers, just a weird nihilistic way of hoping lol. I hope this makes some sense. I simply wanted to acknowledge you but fake wishes from stranger don't make feel less alone. Reading of other people's issues and pain however makes me reevaluate my own issues and realise our shared humanity and pain and that's something to remember."
europe,fff39zi,t1_ffevbpd,1579874537.0,"The ambiguity wasn't intended but I liked it both ways until I really thought about how some people could read it. I can't imagine a stout atheist appreciating the ""rest in peace""... Im still not over Pratchett and Banks :("
europe,fff1l1b,t1_ffeyvcs,1579873182.0,"We Luxembourgers have yet to achieve that. The Romans were leading in culture, education, population and conquest, we just abused an exploit in the economy and had a high diplomatic score only because our neigbours got tired of fighting each other over who becomes suzterain.
 I might have played to much civ 6. I would petition to be included as a city-state but my fellow Luxembourgers would mostly get butthurt if we're included as an economic city-state with the unlock ability to sipher gold from other civ's trade routes.."
pics,ffez9kf,t3_et94qz,1579871148.0,"There is or was a park in Glasgow/Scotland where a ton of semi-tame grey squirrels house. I went with a friend who brought a hand-full of peanuts with him they took right out of his hand, some even jumping up on his legs. I was envious of the attention but all I had were a few twix. I know chocolate is poisonous to dogs so to take little risk for the animals, I chewed of the caramel and and lucked of the chocolate. Totally not because I had munchies... They seemed to love the soaky biscuit but after two, which I shared between 4 or 5 squirrels, the chillest one, the only one I dared to touch, seemed to love it too much and also realise that I was biting something off it or maby he just didn't like my spit all over it but he waited until I took the wrapper off and just before I put it into my mouth, he jumped in my face in the least aggressive way possible, I didn't feel the claws I very much felt when they jumped up my leg, grabbed it and took off. Of course I now know that you shouldn't feed processed sugary human food to wild animals and that playing around with wild animals that can have rabies is dumm but its still my favourite experience I had with a wild animal. I hope you enjoyed my squirrel story."

europe,ffer8jw,t1_ffeq76d,1579861544.0,The fires affected roughly an area of twice the size of Belgium. Belgium is is about 12 times the size of Luxembourg. How many bank accounts could an African swallow open up before everything is consumed by flame?
explainlikeimfive,ffek5an,t1_ffbza8b,1579851381.0,That is what's so crazy. The fangs are rather brittle and grow straight up through the skull. I found no info whether the animal feels the pain one would expect from that.. My hypotheses is that the genes responsible are linked to one's that are overwhelmingly positive for reproduction in an yet undiscovered way and that reduced predator numbers allow a much greater amount of hogs to reach the age when it becomes problematic.
