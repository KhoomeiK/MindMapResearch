The location near me stopped recycling except for some basic stuff for about a year till they got a grant to put in a new machine. The reason was because there was so much crap mixed in with the recycling that they were just ending up putting it in the dump, while also not making any money off of the 'garbage'. The new machine took care of a lot of the sorting issues and even allowed them to take plastic bags. So they picked back up again."
