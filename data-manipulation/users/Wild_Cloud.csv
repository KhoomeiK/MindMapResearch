PewdiepieSubmissions,fdiznim,t3_ell6jr,1578454748.0,"Before you freak out there is a very real chance that as long as Trump decides to call it quits here everything should die down. Now if he doesn’t or Iran continues with more airstrikes/attacks then we may have a war on our hands soon... personally I’m hopeful, I don’t really support Trump but it seems like he’s taking the decision to say it’s over from here which is probably the best option. Take this with a grain of salt though, I’ve been following all this loosely but I think we’ll be OK from here."

lonely,fd4jjwr,t3_ejxuzt,1578168089.0,"Similar stuff yeah, I’ve been used as leverage to get with someone else **twice** probably just a good example of how gullible and overly loyal I can be though. Not that I blame them for not wanting to stay with me though, I’m probably the worst when it comes to relationships. I think you’ll find someone someday though, I don’t know when it’ll be but I believe in you, don’t rush things though!"
lonely,fd4hl0g,t3_ejyitb,1578167513.0,"The worst thing about it though is that a lot of people who aren’t loyal used to be, but people take advantage of that and the loyal ones lose out making them wonder why they bothered in the first place. Always treat people with kindness cause you never know what it takes for people to open up and do the same for you and others."
lonely,fd4gylj,t3_ejzhuj,1578167381.0,"I say that it’s what we do with those thoughts that’ll make things better or worse for us. Think about how bad things are gonna be and it’ll probably end up being that way. Think about how good things could be and even if they don’t go well you can still believe that things may get better and eventually they will.

Sorry if that sounded dumb I’m not the best with inspiration or words of wisdom."

lonely,fd4f9jy,t3_ejwmar,1578167022.0,"I can relate to this a lot, I love my friends so incredibly much and would take a bullet for them no questions asked on any day of the week. Only problem is that most of them prefer to hang out and be with other people, which isn't bad by any means, of course they should be able to hang out with anyone of choice with or without me, it’s their life and they can live it however they want. Part of the problem for me though is how anti-social I can be I’m a bit of an aphenphosmphobic and I dread having to meet new people and go out when I’d rather be at home, but that doesn’t change the fact that I get lonely and wish that I could go out and be with them. I rarely get invites to go out and do things with them but then I hear them tell all these stories about them hanging out with other people all the time. Maybe a suggestion I can give you is to try to find more people with similar interests to your own, it can be hard I know that a lot but things can’t get better unless you do something about it yourself. If you wanna talk at all about any of it feel free to message me and I’ll do my best to listen and help. Best of wishes to you though."
lonely,fd4czqo,t3_ejpl77,1578166447.0,"Golly yes, I can spend hours on end just making up scenarios that will never occur but are fun to think about nonetheless. It’s gotten to the point that I’ve started writing some of it down to remember it and even build upon it. Only problem is I tend to do it when I probably shouldn’t be I.E. a lesson in school and I tend to not take everything in as well as I should :/"
