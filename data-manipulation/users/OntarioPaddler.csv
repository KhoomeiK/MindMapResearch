In this respect, the Trump administration has failed by escalating the conflict, with completely suspect motives no less.

If it was just an uncontained engine failure, which is also possible, it's an insane coincidence of timing."
canada,fdlkom3,t1_fdlkg5e,1578526188.0,"[Southwest Airlines Flight 1380](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines_Flight_1380): a [Boeing 737-700](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737-700)  flying from New York to Dallas in 2018 suffered an uncontained engine  failure on its #1 engine during climb resulting in a puncture to left  side of the fuselage causing a loss of cabin pressure and damage to the  wing and empennage. The aircraft diverted to Philadelphia International  Airport, PA for a safe landing. There was one fatality.

[American Airlines Flight 383](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_383_(2016)): a [Boeing 767-300ER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_767-300ER)  flying from Chicago to Miami in 2016 suffered an uncontained engine  failure on its #2 engine during takeoff resulting in a large fire which  destroyed the outer right wing. The aircraft aborted takeoff and was  evacuated with 21 minor injuries, but no fatalities.

If AA383 had been at 8000 feet when it's engine failed it would have gone down in flames too. You're as ignorant as you are arrogant.  Keep downvoting me all you want it doesn't make you any less wrong, just more pathetic.

Arrogant ignorance like yours is the worst kind."

What does Iran have to gain from shooting down a plane of their own people? If it was them, which is still complete speculation, it was likely an accident.

What exactly is bombing them supposed to accomplish, other than escalating a conflict and killing more innocents.

Hurrr let's just bomb them! Why don't you ask the family members of the dead Iranian Canadians if they think we should bomb the rest of their family too. Unbelievable..."
canada,fdl11bi,t1_fdkyul7,1578515172.0,"Iran never said they wouldn't give Ukrainian investigators access to the black box.  Seems like they intend on cooperating with the Ukrainians. 

They only said they wouldn't give it to Boeing or American officials, and there's a pretty clear political reason for that.

There hasn't been any expert analysis of this 'shrapnel damage', which could have a variety of causes, so that is just more speculation.

I'm not saying Iran didn't do it, but it also isn't a certainty like some people are claiming. There are numerous other possibilities."
