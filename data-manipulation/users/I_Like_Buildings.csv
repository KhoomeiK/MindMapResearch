A single show that I have never even heard of can't have that much influence on our society as a whole. If suicide rates are rising among young men it's because of something that a large majority of people are feeling. Something such as the constant message from our media that men are evil and just want to rape everyone comes to mind. The correlation to the #metoo movement would be much stronger in my opinion, where the media said they don't give a fuck about men's rights and beliefs. That's a societal shift that happened in the same time period of the drastic rise in suicides by men. It could also have something to do with how offended everyone gets now days related to politics. Young men are constantly told that they don't matter as much as minorities and women through the massive focus on diversity and inclusion, which ironically excludes the largest group."

Was it a little weird to say it that way? Sure, but to assume the worst interpretation of the statement in my mind is overtly disingenuous and is a perfect example of someone believing something simply because they hate someone. It demonstrates to me a very clear lack of the ability to empathize with someone and interpret things the way they were meant and not the way you want them to be. 

The irony here is that he immediately assumed things about you without knowing you or your intent. He slanders people like me who frequent the_donald often.

The sub posts a lot of things I outright disagree with, there is an occasional racially charged post, Trump posts a lot of things I outright disagree with, but that doesn't matter.

The other side focuses on the mothers life, which in my opinion has merit as well. Having a child is a life changing event, and a huge change as well. Having a baby at the wrong time can mean the difference in becoming a doctor or becoming a stay at home mother.

Trump ended the practice of separating children from their family anyway. He also vastly increased the number of judges to try to process asylum claims (Which dems tried to block).

What is far more cruel is to allow illegal immigration in the first place. There are many very bad things that happen when illegal immigration is accepted/rewarded. Let me list just a few.

1. Immigrants make a dangerous journey through the desert where many die of thirst or other injuries.
2. Immigrants will pay coyotes to get across the border where up to [80% of women are raped](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/central-america-migrants-rape_n_5806972)
3. Once an immigrant gets here they don't have easy access to social support systems, so when something goes wrong they have nobody to turn to
4. They underpay taxes which puts the burden on taxpayers like you and I
5. They suppress wages by taking low skilled labor jobs that are already disappearing due to automation.
6. The low skilled jobs they take mean it's even more difficult for other struggling communities such as the black community to get jobs, it exacerbates crime and poverty in these communities

The argument about strong borders is absolutely idiotic. It should be literally impossible to get into this country illegally. The only discussion that matters is how many legal immigrants we can allow into the country. Democrats like illegal immigration because it leads to more voters that will vote for them. The rich like illegal immigration because it means they get an abundance of cheap labor. Nobody actually gives a fuck about a sustainable and fair immigration system that makes sense. Everyone is too busy calling everyone a racist to get anything done.

You will also notice that nearly every article refers to illegal immigrants simply as immigrants. Every time Trump talks about illegal immigration the news articles leave out the ""illegal"" and simply say immigrants. This is incredibly dishonest, because Trump has no issues with immigration, his only issues are with unfettered illegal immigration. Immigration is an issue that Trump literally cannot lose on, because the reality of the situation is on his side. When democrats regain power they are going to continue Trump's policies and actually enact many laws Trump has been trying to pass, because they are the only way forward.

The reason we are where we are in this country right now is because people are too emotional. They are too lazy to educate themselves on what is actually going on. In addition to that the democratic party has turned to identity politics which places value based on the color of someone's skin or their socioeconomic status. This is dogma, and has nothing to do with what is actually true. 

I would vote for someone other than Trump if they were able to be honest about everything. I would absolutely love to have someone with similar policy objectives as Trump who doesn't sound like a belligerent idiot sometimes. 100% the reason people hate Trump is because he is so pompous and hyperbolic about everything. It makes them predisposed to disagree with everything he says simply because they don't like his personality. It makes people hyper critical of literally everything he does. It is what leads to ""fake news"" which is really just his way of pointing out how exaggerated, misleading, or false the news is.

I'll finish with pointing out [this](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/c_fill,g_auto,w_1200,h_675,ar_16:9/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F180618100931-viral-photo-migrant-child-cage-trnd.jpg) photo was staged during the Obama years which has been used far and wide as propaganda against Trump."

Doesn't matter if Trump had sex with her or not. If he did who cares. I'm sure he has had sex with many many women. If he had sex with her while he was with Melania and there were any truth to the story, do you think Melania would still be with him? Kinda how Ilhan Omar's husband divorced her after allegations of an affair came out. 

The media paraded around every accuser of Kavanaugh and Trump with no corroboration. The majority of Kavanaugh accusers either admitted they lied or have been proven to be liars. Who would have thought someone would lie about something to prevent a conservative being appointed to the strongest court in the world. No critical thinking is applied with much of the media as long as it looks bad on Trump. Remember how everyone believed Jussie Smollett's stupid story and even blamed Trump? As someone who has been personally falsely accused of crimes by a woman I find it personally insulting how little the media cares about this shit. Did you see the recent story about the high school football star who spent years in prison until the girl said he didn't do it?

There are things that they do get right, like the crowd size thing, but they make a massive story about it and overplay it. Who gives a shit about the crowd size or if he had sex with a girl or not, or if he called some people some mean names. What I care about is policy."
