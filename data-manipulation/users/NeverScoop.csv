The prime examples seem to be enviromental de-regulation implied as a negative thing, or the US's withdrawal from the paris climate deal. Over-regulation is just as bad as underregulation, yet there is no effort made to discuss the actual policy of the matter. The implication is clearly that environmental deregulation = bad. 

As for the climate deal, it's dubious that the deal would accomplish it's goal. Its dubious China has ever been truthful about their emissions levels.
