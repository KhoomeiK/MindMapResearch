prolife,ffb95rm,t3_eshfe1,1579755745.0,"I strongly suspect this point of view is correct and I occasionally feel ashamed for continuing to eat meat despite these misgivings. 

Other commenters have suggested that human life is more valuable or important than animal life. While this is undoubtedly true, it does not prove to me that animal life still has not enough value or importance to be worthy of protection. 

I certainly don't think meat eating is unethical in circumstances when one has no other means of maintaining a healthy diet. It is expensive and difficult to eat vegetarian (I have done it) and this can not be expected of the very poor or the uncivilized. 

But, if I am perfectly able to subsist on a diet that does not cause harm to any form of animal life, what more justification do I have for my carnivorous diet than has the woman who aborts for convenience?

Ingesting narcotics while pregnant may or may not kill the baby, but in any case it can lead to birth defects and other health problems for the baby once it is born. According to the pro-choice premise, the baby is not a human life until x weeks (for some given x), so whatever harm is done to it before that time is inconsequential. However, the effects of the drugs persist long after x weeks, and drug use that takes place during early pregnancy can still have an harmful effect on the baby later on once it has become a human life."

When I started working and paying my own bills, I realized that this is nonsense that only an 18 year old can believe. It is very hard to make money, and only rarely is it ever ""handed to you"" as an adult. 

I think there is a valid point buried in the post, which is that having children can be very financially difficult on mothers, especially poor or single mothers. While that is not an excuse to have an abortion, I believe the strong and successful among us bear some responsibility to help lighten that burden if we are able. Maybe that does not mean moving out of your house, but at least try to give to relevant charities or volunteer."

AskAPriest,ff7lfa9,t1_ff7jbv8,1579652346.0,"What I mean by historical documentation is ""an account of what happened"". I do not think that is a modern concept, and I think people have been giving accounts of what happened since the beginning of mankind.

When Luke says ""John the Baptist said x,y,z"" then either John the Baptist actually said x,y,z, or Luke was mistaken. I can not ascribe a spiritual meaning to a mistake. Since in this case, either Luke or John was wrong, then whichever passage was the wrong one must be wholly without spiritual meaning because it was clearly intended to be an account of what happened."
AskAPriest,ff6y172,t1_ff5vhoc,1579637228.0,"I am unable to extract any spiritual guidance from the majority of such passages. I think if you observe closely, you will find that in most cases, ""treating the text as a spiritual guide"" amounts to ignoring it in practice.

I mean for instance, in this case, one or the other and not both of Luke and John's gospels contain the historical truth. The one that doesn't must be either a deliberate fabrication or a false memory. In neither case can I ascribe any spiritual meaning to the text. It is intended as a historical record, but just happens to be a false one.

It would be nonsensical for me to do anything other than just ignore whichever version is the false one."

You are where I was years ago. I understand the pressure not to call yourself pro-life because of the connotations of that word. Ultimately, it is more important what is right than what others think of you. 

As for your hang-up, the state is not forcing her to have the baby. The pregnancy is happening all by itself. The state is only forcing her not to do something, namely, not to have the baby killed. There are many instances of the state requiring you not to do something with your reproductive organs, which you would find acceptable. You are not allowed to use them for incest or sex with animals. You are not allowed to hide stolen items in them. Etc."
prolife,ff5b9b7,t3_epy55k,1579585978.0,"But if you were to believe as we do that the unborn child is a living human being then you would not let someone kill it even if they made a personal choice to do so. On the other hand, if we did not think the unborn child were a living human being, we would have no problem with killing it, hence no personal belief that abortion is wrong. So there is no case in which it would make sense for me to have a personal belief that abortion is wrong while allowing that it might be acceptable for someone else. Either it is wrong for everyone, or it is okay for anyone."
