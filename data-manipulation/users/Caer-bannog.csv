Sekiro,ff5ykot,t3_erssrb,1579614409.0,"Hey man, 1st piece of advice is just ignore toxic comments outright. Internet's full of it so the moment you see it's toxic garbage just stop reading and skip that comment - done!

2nd piece of advice: if the Tyrannicon videos are the ones I'm thinking of where the guy sounds like an obnoxious Monty Python character speaking nasally, I would avoid them like the plague. Not that they're not useful - they'll help you *get through* fights, but not in a way that's intended by design, or even fun to execute. It takes the soul out of the game.

3rd piece of advice: most bossfights are almost like a rhythm game! But more than just memorizing how to parry/punish different moves, try to understand how *your actions (or lack thereof)* generate specific reactions! For example, understanding how to ""trade blows"" is essential. Many enemies (including bosses and minibosses) will swing back at you after you swing at them once or twice - even if it seems like you'll be able to get a third attack in, you'll probably get hit instead. 

(As a rule of thumb, you're usually only able to get in more than two consecutive swings if you made the enemy flinch due to an HP threshold or right after you inflict status effects like burn.)

Attacking 1-2 times prompts the enemy to attack back, usually in a very predictable pattern (you still need to learn the rhythm) that you can deflect or even punish! At worst, you'll avoid all damage in the trade and be given a new window to get another 1-2 attacks in. At best, you'll get that AND do a ton of posture damage from deflecting and punishing!

And this sort of ""provoking"" trade isn't the only way you can influence enemy action. Some moves (usually very punishable with Ichimonji) can be triggered by *creating a certain amount of distance* from the enemy. Now, usually, you want to stay on top of the enemy because their ranged moves are mostly designed to wreck you; a way for the game to tell you to stay on top of your foes. But for example the very last boss has a highly punishable overhead jump/swing that can be triggered by creating a bit of distance - he uses it to try to close the gap you're trying to create, and you can dash past it and Ichimonji his ass while he recovers from it.

I hope these help, happy to go into specific bossfights but I think these pointers are quite universal!"
