AnimalsBeingBros,ffg728s,t1_ffg5e2q,1579899852.0,"Yeah but I’m sure your dog comes to the door when they’re too cold and ready to come in, though. I know my cousin’s husky will lay down outside in the winter when they let him out to pee so they just leave him til he comes to the back door."
AnimalsBeingBros,ffftz1l,t1_fffmqnl,1579891747.0,Dogs like German shepherds love the cold weather since they’re well insulated. And the cat probably just likes to sleep on the dog cuz he’s warm.

relationship_advice,fffp2oq,t3_etbkyi,1579888715.0,"Like someone else said, be good to yourself during this healing process. Take care of yourself. When my dog passed, I went to the shelter and volunteered to walk the dogs. I was the weirdo walking a dog down the street openly crying for a little while but it helped fill the hole lol it makes me feel good to do good for others. It might help you too! The dogs need walked and socialized and just visited with. They need someone to spend time with and so do you."
comedyheaven,fffff91,t1_fff4yup,1579882786.0,Yes but a quick death after a cage free life is much preferable to a cut off fin and leaving the shark to bleed to death.
Showerthoughts,fffc6py,t3_et95vn,1579880741.0,Yeah I saw that post about Grease too
fatlogic,fff39rx,t1_ffcp8rg,1579874532.0,"Yeah I feel like in this case it’s probably safe to assume they’re working out. But in cases where someone who isn’t 500lbs and more like 180 or so drops like 20-30 lbs and it’s not obvious they’ve been more healthy and fit, it’s not safe to assume. I think that’s what this post is referring to."
insaneparents,fff2zy3,t1_fff27r8,1579874319.0,Yw! I tried to link the actual fb post but I couldn’t get a link to copy on mobile. I don’t use Facebook often so I don’t know how to work it.
insaneparents,fff0wlx,t1_ffem8tk,1579872614.0,"Hijacking this comment to post [more info and replies.](https://imgur.com/a/7pAwQD2)

So it seems like OP found the post on a pro-vax page that makes fun of anti-vaxxers (that’s what that logo is for at the bottom) so I posted a few of their comments and someone there posted a screenshot where the original anti-vaxxer edited their post with more info. I can’t find/access the anti-vax group so I can’t get anything more than what the other users posted."

functionalprint,ffdspoa,t1_ffdndzu,1579827962.0,I was 17 when I made it cut me some slack
fatlogic,ffdal0f,t1_ffda3h9,1579816712.0,"“You working out?”

“No.”

“Well you look great!”

“I’ve been sick so I haven’t kept anything down in days but thanks I guess.”

Obviously it works out if the person says yes but the point of this post is that they might not."
BadMUAs,ffd8r1h,t3_esw7zd,1579815633.0,Did you fucking type this up and screenshot it to get around the no text post rule? It’s still a text post
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffd5rzb,t1_ffbwi8g,1579813966.0,That was a really enjoyable watch!! Thanks for sharing
pokemon,ffcpyhv,t1_ffcps1v,1579804757.0,Oh I forgot it’s canon that they’re mostly air and smaller than the anime makes them out to be
