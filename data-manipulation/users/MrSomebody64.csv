depression,fdk9p4l,t3_elqwy9,1578499238.0,"Honestly. I'm not sure. I don't like the idea of telling myself I'm depressed since I actually know extreme cases and It doesn't feel nice comparing myself with people going through hard times, like degrading the meaning. But. I always had the constant fight with myself. Keeping me down and feel ashamed and negative for everything. I can't enjoy happy moments for more that 5 mins. Laughter turning to crying. Anger and sadness for all the missed opportunities. An empty childhood with no friends, love. The love I lost and will never get a chance with. The constant negative self beating in my head for I'm not ""good enough"". Generally I try to understand why most the daily stuff are important,...if that makes sense, like I do them because I have to. Uncertain future.... All that and nothing in particular. If that makes sense."

depression,fco53ha,t3_ehsd09,1577824242.0,"Update :

After some time alone and the help of some very amazing people on reddit , i talked through my problems and realised some stuff I wasnt aware of and made me feel a bit better about myself ( and my manhood in this case). I still feel empty though and with no apparent reason to continue, so i decided...i just will. I will go on for at least a bit more. I truly made my mind to be the one deciding how and when my time will come. But I'll stay with the curiosity , for now at least. Time will show as always although it feels different this time.

Thank you everyone and have a nice new year. At least try."
depression,fco4fwf,t3_ei6kvs,1577823887.0,"Do a favour to yourself. Stop watching every mainstream social media. Facebook, Instagram, SnapChat. 

Seeing other people's lifes/lies they post online can really mess with the perception of reality and what is normal  and what you should do in your life. You end up comparing it with your life and when you see a miss match  you feel wrong . I say f\*ck em (metaphorically XD).

I just had an awful first time , with my crush of 5 years, and Ill never get a second chance. Im following a life path im not sure of, and im currently alone . But embrace it. Focus on yourself, what you like, do it, make your room/cosy enough and have a drink, watch a movie, listen to a song or do what I do and dive in the vastness of internet / reddit. You are not alone. Besides , never forget . Its not about how hard you can punch, but how hard you are able to get punched and get back on your feet, an keep moving forward. Shitty times will come and go same as the good ones, its all in the schedule . 

Have a nice and calm NYE and a calm year in general . Peace"
depression,fco2api,t3_ei78to,1577822759.0,Its my first time on reddit and Im alone too. I feel exactly the same way my friend. Have a nice and calm New Years Eve and a good and peaceful year in general . You are not alone in here ! Take care !

sex,fcmnwdw,t1_fcmn1j0,1577783516.0,"Yeah I was emotionally invested. 

And there were a few nice moments. 
There was communication and having a history since highschool, this chemistry was short of transfered in bed.

 She did moan a number of times while trying stuff for the first time, with her guidance, but still there was a limit to what I could do doing all that for the first time.

I'm trying to think of this idea of trying something with someone new where I'm studying, it just feels like I'm used to a specific type of personality and there, they are a bit different compared to that, the majority of the girls I've met at least (I'm Greek, studying in the UK).

Yeah I really don't want to lose that person. Its just the idea of this lost opportunity that gets me for now.

I'll try not to be too harsh. Thanks for the tips. It really helps having talks like that in those occasions. Thank you."
sex,fcmm4r7,t1_fcmlif8,1577781112.0,"First time yes.
 I feel I failed a purpose as a man. Because I wanted to make her feel good instead of this awkward and unfinished thing we had. I hate myself a bit for failing my last shot with that person. And I feel empty, for I don't know how to proceed from now.
 Now, I did learn a few things because we had some communication going and she was emotionally invested. 
And I now know what to expect short of. And we also decided to remain friends. 
Because we still have a chemistry.

But. 

The reason nothing can happen is because she wants to continue on a serious relationship with another person and I'm studying abroad. So that's why it was important for me. My first time with her would be the last. Thus I'm now empty for what I've lost/failed."
sex,fcmk9te,t1_fcmjvku,1577778741.0,Thank you for your advice! I will have all that in mind for the next time. Whenever it will be. But not with the same person because its kind of a closed window now. I should have been more clear with her of what I like or how I would prefer it to be for me to be conformable. We started with casual kissing and rubbing and the next thing I know she mentioned the bedroom and instead of saying all that I went on with it. And the rest is history. Just wondered if there is anything I could do to make me calm down from it now. But your advices are definitely helpful.
depression,fclboi4,t1_fcl7u0b,1577744113.0,Thank you. But I feel that is my time. I constantly felt empty and only had a few things to hope for in my life. Losing my hopes in my manhood and my crush's interests because of it was enough to crack me. I just can't anymore.

CasualConversation,fc8b0c7,t3_egol79,1577530860.0,"It was weird and at the same time wonderful . I study abroad and when I came back home I hadn't seen friends and relatives for moths. Living in my ""big"" house again after the comfort of my nest-of-a-flat-room felt different. I never appreciated my house that much until now , with all those comforts and spaces . Same to say about living with other people, family in that case. Going out with my ""good-old-highschool squad"" after an exhausting year was 'golden' and all the teasing and harsh jokes  made me feel like highschool again. People dont tend to be like that where Im studying . And finally, the one thing I wanted the most but never expected to happen, happened. My childhood crush of 6 years, the person I had shared and been through every feeling there is and who was a good friend of mine with great chemistry , showed the same response as me , and something finally happened between us ! We were standing in the middle of a park kissing , few lights, almost snowing, and it was great time both of us will remember for some time for sure.  She even said a few things that absolutely melted my heart , and being a person trying to overcome depression really gave me a ""spark"" to keep me going. Its like those moments that dont need to happen more than once,you know its a one time thing, but are....enough...and make you think for the future in a different way."
