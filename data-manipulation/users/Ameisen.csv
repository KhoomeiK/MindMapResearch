Continents* - again, the seven-continent model is followed in all Anglosphere nations. While the ""United States of North America"" was occasionally used (though generally in Britain and not in the US) before being cemented in 1789 (though I'd argue it was cemented in 1781), the term ""Usonian"" has pretty much *never* been used in the US other than, say, by Frank Lloyd Wright. It sounds about as silly as ""US-ian"" or ""United Statesian"".

There's a reason we call it the American Revolutionary War, and not the ""United Statesian Revolutionary War"",

No, you're from the South American continent. In the English-speaking world, the seven-continent model is followed. Generally, it is expected you follow cultural customs/norms when using someone else's language to communicate with them.

You are, of course, welcome to refuse to speak English properly.

It's also pretty rude to say that someone's endonym is *wrong*. Like, incredibly rude.

1. Communism is a form of socialism: it is an ideological branch that is under the socialist umbrella. Not that there is only one kind of 'communism'.
2. I did not call socialism communism. I called communism a form of socialism, because it is.
3. All forms of 'communism' are socialist. Not all forms of socialism are communist.
4. Social democratism isn't a form of socialism in the first place.

> US people

We call ourselves ""Americans"", not ""US people"" (which sounds almost offensive) or ""Usanians"". ""American"", in English (both American and Commonwealth), generally refers to the United States, as all Anglophone countries follow the seven-continent system, and the less-specific adjectives in English are ""North American"" and ""South American"". The ambiguity simply doesn't exist in English.

How would you feel being called a South American Portuguese person?

I assure you that I am well aware of the various ideological forms of socialism, and the difference between (democratic) socialism and social democratism.

todayilearned,ffcy293,t1_ffcwwz7,1579809637.0,"The influence of French on Middle English is generally overstated. Most people compare something like Beowulf (early Old English poetry) to late Middle English, which is odd. Late Old English and Early Middle English are basically the same language, and most of the shifts in English, primarily in case reduction and reduction in inflection overall, were already occurring in Late Old English."
todayilearned,ffcxt38,t1_ffct1zo,1579809496.0,"The case system of Late Old English around 1100 was already reduced from Early Old English. By 900, the instrumentive case is completely gone. By the time of the Norman Conquest (1066), the dative and accusative cases were already merging into a single oblique case, and the complex system of noun declension was already reducing, sound shifts were already causing changes in vocabulary (even in pronouns, which is why we say *this*/*that*)...

The shift towards SVO word order is common in basically all Germanic languages, though it's largely incomplete in most, which many going from the original SOV of Common Germanic to V2 word order, which Old English did as well. By Late Old English, SVO was already pretty common. *All* Germanic languages (aside from East Germanic which I'm not too familiar with) lost the ancestral SOV word order, switching to V2/VF word order. Even English still retains vestiges of the V2 word order, mainly in interrogatives and adverbial phrases. Late Old English was solidly V2 with SVO starting to develop, but the primary switch from V2 to SVO occurred during the Middle English period - Early Middle English is largely V2, and Late Middle English is largely SVO. English is the only Germanic language to switch basically entirely to SVO, though they all are somewhere between V2 and SVO, with *none* of them retaining SOV.

While the SVO word order did appear in the Old French period in French, it would have still been relatively volatile at the time, with native Latin SOV order still being used sometimes. The usage of SVO in English is not due to the influence of French - the shift from SOV to V2 to SVO was already occurring in Old English. Similar to the Germanic languages, Old French was actually largely *V2* word order, and this might have been due to Frankish influence (Frankish being a West Germanic language).

Yes, *rewme* is from Old French *reaume*, and is the modern word *realm*. It never successfully displaced native *kingdom* (OE *cyningdom*, ME *kingdom*), though."

In that text, you're just seeing 300 years further of linguistic evolution - Old English by 1100 was already merging the accusative and dative cases into the oblique, many word endings had already been lost, and so forth.
