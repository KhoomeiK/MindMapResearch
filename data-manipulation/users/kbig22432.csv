quityourbullshit,fg0orf8,t1_fg0nzmw,1580412075.0,"I’m guessing you found that specific type of swan that negates my argument on the free and easy to use internet. Which also has easy to access pictures or swans, and many other animals, so claiming not to know what general color swan’s beaks are when we have a wealth of information at one’s literal fingertips is silly. This isn’t 1909, we don’t only have regional knowledge that’s earned through experience.

Feeling the need to call someone names to prove your point isn’t a great look either, even if it is a dated term."

I have a bachelors in English Ed and teach HS juniors. I’m well aware that proper spelling is important for job related reasons. 

I also know that nit picking grammar, while sometimes necessary, is also a way of ensuring students, and others, don’t write anything for fear of ridicule. This is a user-based site with many different levels of English competency. If you are truly worried about my, or others, grammar, then send them a PM and alert them to the error. Putting them on blast makes you look petty.

Also, thank you for subbing. It’s not an easy job and it goes unnoticed. I appreciate you."
