8AM-8:30 first walk of the day 

Noon-12:30 lunch walk and play time

4:30-5PM after we get back from work

9PM last potty break"
puppy101,fewix2j,t1_fewis1r,1579411465.0,I’m pretty sure he will! Continue with what you’re doing in maintaining calm. You’re doing a great job
puppy101,fewilii,t3_eqs58o,1579411279.0,How old is your pup? Mine excited peed whenever she met new people/dogs all the time and my vet wasn’t concerned. They tend to develop more control of their bladder as they get older. My pup is now 1 year and she rarely ever excitement pees now. I also stay vigilant tho in making sure she’s “empty” before bringing her anywhere or meeting people
corgi,feryzjs,t1_fert02k,1579359809.0,Same! I feel bad for asking lol but yay! I will be following :)
corgi,fep09n6,t3_eq8uyn,1579309256.0,He’s absolutely adorable!! Does he have an IG???
reactivedogs,feeorbm,t3_eorul8,1579038062.0,Woohoo!! I’m so happy for you! I’m working on getting my dog comfortable with the dremel and it is a tough process right now
Dogtraining,fedksor,t3_eom479,1579013996.0,"She’s so young and this is very normal since she hasn’t experience large trucks/cars yet. Start small with baby steps and listen to your pup! Her walking away definitely means scared so be sure not to force her because you want to make positive associations. My pup was exactly like yours so I brought her outside (aside from walks) just to observe cars from a distance and brought lots of treats! Treat anytime she sees a car pass from a distance. By doing this, you’ll start to normalize the sights, sounds, and smells of cars

Congrats with your new pup! Also, if you don’t mind me saying. Please do check with your vet to make sure it is safe to walk your pup so young in your area. My area had higher rates of parvo (and owners who didnt pick up after their dogs) so I didn’t let her go on walks until more vaccinations."
dogs,fecc4oy,t1_febhzf8,1578970505.0,I believe in you!! Good luck with the chat with your friend. You have all of us backing you up
dogs,feaw3sl,t3_eoavj1,1578952778.0,"I’ll be honest! I have a family friend that has 3 kids and 2 dogs (older, not puppies) and those dogs are ignored a good 80% of the time. They get fed, they are let out to potty but other than that, nothing. It’s very sad. At the same time, kids are a BIG commitment too (not saying its justifiable). 

There are families that are able to have kids and raise puppies so it’s doable. BUT based on how your friend is, it’s not a good idea. I feel like you should talk to your friend just so you know you tried and did your best. She’s lucky she has a good friend like you. If she’s hard headed and stubborn, no matter what you say, she will not change her mind."
dogs,fe9a9bk,t3_eo6p3b,1578935791.0,"My dog has one of those hard nylon Benebones. It can get rough and sharp so I make sure to file it down (sandpaper or just a nail file is fine) or remove any pieces that she can swallow daily. If it’s pretty beat up, maybe it is time to replace with a new one"
Dogtraining,fds0wxo,t3_emx5v8,1578692550.0,"All my pup’s leash training went out the window when I tried a retractable leash! It only taught her how to pull which was horrible. I ditched the retractable and went back to a normal leash (padded handle, 4ft long)."
corgi,fdokujn,t3_emglsf,1578607178.0,Happy Gotcha day! Mortimer is a CUTIE!
Dogtraining,fdbt82h,t3_ekhrdi,1578261636.0,"You should definitely check out [Puppy 101](https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101) ! They have lots of resources and it’s a great community for new pup owners no matter the experience

Try with the redirecting with a toy or treat anytime your pup bites something you don’t want it to! Repetition and patience is key.

As for leaving it alone that long, depending on the age most puppies cannot hold their bladder that long. How old is your pup? It would be best if someone can come throughout the day to play/let pup out

Congrats on your pup! Things get better overtime trust me! My pup calmed down around 4-5 months, then adolescence hit. It’s a long road but so worth it. Good luck!"
puppy101,fdbsk56,t3_ekiccd,1578261327.0,Omg what a great idea!!!
puppy101,fcz9ww8,t3_ejnv76,1578096631.0,"Mabel is a cutie! Definitely normal! I would try to do enforced naps if you can. Puppies of that age don’t have an “off” mode quite yet (=even tho they are tired, they just don’t know to go nap because life is so exciting). They will definitely grow out of it but good job is rewarding when they are relaxing.

I know you’re not taking your pup outside because of vaccinations, but taking your pup on a car drive to see sights/sounds or carrying them around (carrier or in your arms) is a great way to socialize and get them tired!"
dogs,fcvl6gq,t3_ej41k7,1578004462.0,"It’s not a dumb concern at all! If you can, provide a worn tshirt that way your dog can have your scent for comfort while you’re away"
puppy101,fciaks3,t3_ehckgx,1577659786.0,My pup was just as energetic if not more haha but she did become more of a cuddler (possibly due to age as well)!
puppy101,fc6o9q0,t3_eghtiz,1577485331.0,"How old is your pup? Sometimes excitement and play speeds up the time from last potty to the next. But age is a big factor too! You’re doing a great job with taking them out and rewarding, so with repetition your pup will eventually pick it up! Use a good enzymatic cleaner too to clean up messes

If this continues or if you notice your pup has any discomfort I would bring to vet to rule out a UTI"
puppy101,fc3pk8d,t1_fc38h4y,1577395431.0,That’s great! I personally don’t feel like you could over socialize BUT I would look into the importance passive socializing as well. You want your pup to be comfortable around other people and dogs but not always wanting to greet them. Hope this helps!
puppy101,fc36v1i,t3_efy7lb,1577382879.0,"Congrats on your new bundle of joy! Socializing is super important starting now but always be safe about it! Do not bring your pup to high traffic dog areas (dog park) as you risk chances of parvo/other diseases or let your pup play with other dogs of unknown vaccination status . The important thing about socializing is that this doesn’t only mean having your dog meet other dogs (only fully vaccinated) or people BUT also get your pup used to new sounds, sights, and smells. Ask your vet for advice and what diseases should worry about in your area.

Side advice: enjoy your pups and have lots of patience!!"
Dogtraining,fbbtoth,t3_ecjkrs,1576707906.0,"Keep training sessions short and sweet but frequent throughout the day! Puppies sometimes have short attention spans, get distracted, or just want to play. But as others mentioned, some pups react better to toys and praise too."
