Just the other day I went down to pick up a months supply of 2 types of insulin, pen needles and glucose test strips. The most expensive part of my trip was the 4$ bus fare. 

What the fuck."

AmItheAsshole,fdipnst,t3_ellk2a,1578448228.0,ESH but your mum is the main asshole imo. What you said definitely wasn't right but I understand why you'd blurt something like that out after being badgered for so long.
CasualConversation,fdg1ueg,t3_el391c,1578376926.0,"Yes!

When I was a kid my local video rental store also had a games section. Every week I'd go and pick out a random ps2 and see how much of it I could complete before it had to be returned.

The tiny storage capacity of the old memory cards was soooooo infuriating but god was it a highlight of my childhood."

Also the tradition of ""apology vases"". After each episode he'd buy my mum a flower vase which he would throw at one of us the next time he got too drunk."
AskReddit,fdcy4hl,t3_ekoymy,1578287764.0,"I never saw them but heard regularly and just sort of blocked it out since by the time I understood what they were doing I didn't care.

HOWEVER

One night I heard my (at the time) 6yr old little brother enter their room...
""What are you doing to mum?""
Parents frantically yell at him to get out

Tried so damn hard to keep from laughing"
AskReddit,fdcxmzn,t3_ekoysv,1578287338.0,"I'd get my best friend with me who I know for sure is a better person than me and get to pushing. 

Hopefully theres enough people worse than me for me to rack up enough to pay off his medical debt before I'm killed.

My life isn't worth particularly much to me so if I can end it in a way that benefits someone I care about I'm all for it."
AskReddit,fdcx33m,t1_fdcw9ld,1578286855.0,"Not only are they not being selected out, it's become a preference (or maybe fetish is a better word?) for a lot of people so they are specifically carrying these genes forward."

AskReddit,fdcw72b,t1_fdcvape,1578286087.0,"So you think you can get something from nothing? Dating takes effort. From both sides. 

If you're not willing to better yourself and actually TRY then you don't deserve to be in a relationship."
AmItheAsshole,fdcvjrl,t3_ekop6j,1578285538.0,YTA. Even if they were trans that's really none of your business. If you were unsure of their gender in any way shape or form ask for what they go by - pronouns - and leave it at that.

AskReddit,fd7lqbi,t3_ek99a1,1578206428.0,"In high school I has this beautiful friend who was also incredibly smart like holy shit she was incredible. She got top marks in majority of her classes and ended up dating the guy I had been crushing on (she didn't know so I no reason to be upset). 

I'm not sure what happened but one year she just sort of... changed? Openly admitted to sleeping with her cousin and family friends. Started sharing snaps doing meth, cocaine and god knows what else. 

I'm not entirely sure where she is now since this happened in our final year but I definitely don't envy her and hope to hell she is getting the help she needs."
