NanatsunoTaizai,fdrhw0m,t3_efot95,1578684686.0,"What exactly is Merlin trying to do though? How is this going to feel her void? So her love for Meliodas is still there and she's still hurt? I don't want to sum up her character based on this, but it appears that's basically it. I can't hate her if I was powerful in my own little girl ego ways I could do whatever it takes to get what I want. But surprised she hasn't emotionally matured by these 3,000 years... Maybe Arthur's her new boo"

Berserk,fdg57gg,t3_ejcdyg,1578380485.0,"I want to know the backstory of the skull Knight, too. I believe from what I've read so far is that they got lost in their anger as well and that's why they empathize with Guts. And the big witch helped him through that.

Caska :( I feel to her but fuck her, poor Guts. Okay not entirely fuck her but still mannnn I hope she regains her shit and that part can at least be good for Guts.

I wish Schierke were older for Guts but nah"
