YouShouldKnow,ff9ads4,t3_es59s7,1579708478.0,How many times have you seen a top comment or post that references something in your profession that was completely wrong/dangerously oversimplified? Now think about all the knowledge you think you have based on top comments of things outside of your field of expertise.

coolguides,femno3c,t3_eps4im,1579263897.0,"Don’t forget the shit hole of a website that is Healthline, used to be exclusively only registered dieticians but is now just the buzzfeed of nutrition. The fact that they’re the only publisher to give definitive answers to searches like ‘is sushi healthy’ instead of saying ‘it depends’, like it fucking does."

Showerthoughts,fekly8e,t1_fejufju,1579202803.0,"Water is cool and all but over hydration is a thing, and I’m not talking about dying, I’m talking about developing a mineral deficiency by excessively promoting their excretion through the urine. I used to overhydrate but now I’m #faintyellowclearpissgang."
mildlyinfuriating,fekli5s,t1_feklel1,1579202535.0,Yeah but I don’t think that has anything to do with it since it happens on both accounts with different amounts of unread notifications.
ketoscience,fehlsdi,t1_fehlmhu,1579119137.0,"Oops wrong sign, but still way too big of a possible range to make any conclusions regarding the presence of ketosis. We can, however, speculate about the effects of carb reduction."
ketoscience,fehhb1b,t1_feg9yso,1579116525.0,"Fair enough, at least you’re somewhat self aware. Just realise that becoming more reserved (less radically vocal) is part of enhancing and maturing your understanding of a topic, since you start to realise that you shouldn’t speak so surely on things you can’t be 100% sure are true and are supported by evidence (not in any way referencing your comment in specific, just the Dunning Kruger)."
ketoscience,fehgwjx,t1_fehgnic,1579116292.0,">Poor ignorants, I pity them 

This. 

Part of becoming more knowledgeable in a topic is learning to stop treating it like the be all and all of everything that everybody ought to know. You learn to moderate yourself and always leave room to account for uncertainty as you begin to realise the Dunning Kruger."
ketoscience,fehgmfm,t3_ep1swl,1579116128.0,Studied ‘low carb’ as >40% carbs by caloric proportion. Definitely not keto.

YouShouldKnow,fegywb6,t3_ep3e58,1579105599.0,"Also don’t censor your images with stickers on the app you’re posting on, Facebook, Twitter, and instagram stickers can be removed and shouldn’t be used for censorship."

ScientificNutrition,fedrowi,t3_eon8gm,1579018444.0,Just because something contains compounds associated with healthy effects doesn’t mean it itself is healthy. You’d have to consume hundreds of glasses for a noticeable positive effect dosage.

ketoscience,fe4hl6l,t1_fe2pe80,1578859405.0,Keto kind of ‘emulates’ a faster state in some aspects which is why I would think it’s easier to transition into a fast from.
okbuddyretard,fdz6zpv,t3_en7o7g,1578787278.0,I hope they win their case bro
StopEatingSugar,fdy0ruc,t1_fczuizd,1578774858.0,Yup! I’m keto but would never tell anyone else to be keto unless I was able to sit down with them and explain the whole story regarding fats and common misconceptions.
AskReddit,fdri3t1,t1_fdqtmzo,1578684817.0,Yeah but they’re owned and operated by the Chinese!! (Ok Reddit this is where you give me and the other 20 replies saying ‘fuck china’ gold and upvotes).

ketoscience,fdqvj2o,t1_fdqduop,1578675508.0,I was surprised to learn that muscular maintenance can be as little as one 30 minute moderate intensity session per week from a study that used middle aged men as subjects.
keto,fdp2997,t3_e9098k,1578618276.0,"The ACV stuff is bullshit. There are very few substances that exist that can severely alter complex physiological functions significantly, diet as a whole is what does that. Also, cook and freeze."
ketoscience,fdp096a,t1_fdo4nmu,1578616933.0,Evidence I’ve seen also points to resistance training being far superior to cardio in the long term (and by long term I mean just as little as a couple months and beyond).
ketoscience,fdo99w1,t1_fdo95cp,1578601102.0,"Fair enough, some things are keto for some but not for others in varying doses. Whatever works for you is what is best."
ketoscience,fdo8evj,t1_fdo7vxc,1578600680.0,Are you sure you’re not eating sweetened berries? Back when I used to monitor they never used to spike my BG far enough to remove me from a state of ketosis.
ketoscience,fdo6gkf,t1_fdntuyj,1578599719.0,"Berries are typically pretty low in sugar, most are even keto abd often implemented in carnivore diets."

ketoscience,fdo4zcn,t1_fdo3a6z,1578598994.0,"Any vitamins that are present in oil will be fat soluble due to how oil extraction is filtered. 

Here’s a source that does a good job at explaining why fat soluble vitamins, in general, are more bioavailable than water soluble. https://gettespo.com/blog/bioavailability/"
ketoscience,fdniobg,t1_fdmjnc5,1578586617.0,If it’s in the oil it means that it’s fat soluble and therefore bioavailable.
ketoscience,fdh0hr7,t3_ekyblk,1578412696.0,Keto blood tests mean very little since keto only denotes macronutrient composition and not actual foods.
ScientificNutrition,fdgi0ue,t3_ekwmrx,1578397655.0,"At what point does something become ‘burnt’ in this scenario, would we consider browning a slight burn, or perhaps only when a visible black layer has formed with a distinct flavour?"
LifeProTips,fdghn54,t3_ek98zd,1578397188.0,Just like your body goes into “fat burning mode” when you xyz!! At least be upfront when you grossly oversimplify neuroscience.

ketoscience,fd7h2si,t1_fd6w0gz,1578204400.0,"Yup, this is why I don’t see carbs as the enemy but more as a supreme , rarer, energy source. Stable ketone metabolism is more than enough to keep me fuelled throughout the normal day though, hence why I’m mostly keto."

gainit,fcyusrw,t1_fcyu86q,1578087542.0,"Hormones do not circulate directly to areas that triggered their stimulation, they circulate throughout your entire body. This can better facilitate muscle growth in other muscles, provided you have stimulated them and they too require significant repair. Obviously doing squats won’t improve your bench directly, but popping squats after a bicep workout (small muscle) can improve bicep growth. Hope that makes more sense now."
gainit,fcytzxp,t1_fcytp5j,1578087045.0,"Bigger muscle stimulus = greater area of muscular tissue needing repair, hence stimulating more hormones associated with muscle growth. I’m no stranger to broscience being rampant on Reddit but this isn’t it."
