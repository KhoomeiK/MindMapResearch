AdviceAnimals,fd3s1wr,t1_fd3knl1,1578161189.0,"This isn’t quite true...but close. Tipping was a way businesses could pay black workers less than whites, by letting the customers do the dirty work of paying whites larger tips.  Black workers in general had a hard time finding non service jobs so most of the jobs where tipping is the custom are the kinds of jobs black people could get after the civil war, and through much of the pre-civil rights era.  The effects of this continue today, black people are still tipped less than whites on average.

Tipping, in the us anyway,  has its roots in racism for sure."

TheRightCantMeme,fcvtrtg,t1_fcvsbwt,1578009924.0,"It has everything to do with pack/herd dynamics.  Humans, like primates,  are social creatures, our society is our pack, or troupe or whatever you would prefer to call it.  Packs/herd exist for the survival of a species, and even more the survival of the genetics of the most successful group within a species.  You can pretend humans are above the laws that govern every other organism on the planet and you’d be naive...and arrogant for thinking you can better billions of years of natural law.

Can we take some steps to make our society more successful for our species? Sure.  But ultimately we will NEVER outrun the laws of natural selection because it’s innate to our existence.  There will ALWAYS be members of our species who will fight to hoard resources and deny them to others, you’ll never stop this, so guess what?  You gotta play the game of life and fight for yourself to survive and thrive ....because that’s how life has worked for billions of years on planet earth.  If you think we will stop this in this blip of existence we have existed, even blippier as a global society, you’re pretty damn silly.

malefashionadvice,fcqwqbw,t1_fcpia4e,1577893380.0,"There are shitloads of them, no way to list them all or by brand.  This is kinda like asking a doctor to list all the good hospitals or asking a chef to list all the best restaurants. It would require me to be an expert on the business practices of companies I’ve never worked for. The best I can do is give you generalizations based on my experiences in the industry.

Basically if you are buying from a brand that designs and produces all its own stuff for cheap prices it’s gonna be unethical.  They don’t have anyone outside the organization that can out them to the public about their unethical practices....and if someone tried they’d be bound by gag orders or be accused of being disgruntled.  They’d also control any evidence of such practices.  It’s easy to control when you are in charge of all moving parts.

If you buy from a company that gets its products from multiple vendors you stand a much better chance at getting more ethically made stuff.  The reason is because a company, like Macy’s for example, that has many independent suppliers must put in place certification requirements for their vendors because it’s the only way they can control optics with the public.  Without that certification it would be to easy for some disgruntled employee of one of these 3rd party suppliers, or even a supplier with a vendetta, to out them for selling sweatshop shit, and they’d have no way to do damage control....with that certification Macy can say “nope, all of our suppliers must be certified by such and such organization before we accept goods”.  Almost all large retailers that don’t make their own shit have some sort of factory certification process in place....and they don’t fuck around. Large businesses make enemies, sometimes powerful ones, and they have to be proactive about protecting their interests. 

Edit: also if you buy from makers that have prices that allow for ethical sourcing you’ll probably get ethical sourcing.  Since clean sourcing is a selling point most smaller brands that do will tell you about it...look in the about us page on their sites."

malefashionadvice,fcobiuy,t1_fcnter5,1577828205.0,Indeed many full price retailers make efforts to ensure at least a semblance of ethics.  There was a big blow up back in the 90s about sweatshops and child labor that caused most big retailers to put certification processes in place for all suppliers.  Whenever we supply large retailers our factories have to be independently certified before they’ll accept goods...This is true of almost all of the major department stores and shoppers clubs.
malefashionadvice,fcngz18,t1_fcnea8e,1577811501.0,"You’ll mostly be good if you are buying stuff in the $50+/garment range.  It’s the companies trying to compete on price that are the worst offenders...those deep discounts come from exploiting either people or the environment.  You’ll be hard pressed to find 100% ethical without buying artisan type stuff made in a first world country by a skilled craftsman.  Also most of the large full price retailers are pretty good and use factories that are vetted by companies that inspect factories because back in the 90s there was huge public outcry about labor conditions and now consumers are watching them.  When my companies supply these types of stores the factories have to be certified by one or more of these organizations before they can be shipped to these retailers.

Edit: This doesn’t mean you can’t get ethically sourced products on sale for significantly less than $50 per garment.  Once something is on sale the retailer is giving up some of their profit margin.  The same is true of off-price retailers like marshals and T.J.
