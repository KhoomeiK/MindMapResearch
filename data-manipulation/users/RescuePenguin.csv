pokemongo,fftkpqs,t1_ffsmpav,1580223061.0,I will try it.
pokemongo,fftknzp,t1_ffsneo7,1580223027.0,The first few times I played in the rain was for community day so I needed both hands to quick catch. Now it's almost every day so I might try this.
pokemongo,ffslfo9,t1_ffsj2zg,1580184637.0,Have you tried it yourself?
pokemongo,ffsinmu,t1_ffsimoa,1580182627.0,Does that help with throwing?
todayilearned,ffsiace,t1_ffshh3g,1580182374.0,"They have a big factory in Milwaukie, but they were across the street not that long ago until they needed an even bigger location. Their PR team should really fix this, haha."
IsItBullshit,ffshs6j,t1_ffsd320,1580182020.0,"In the 70s and 80s, big corporations realized they could have their own scientists publish whatever they wanted to muddy the waters. Big Tobacco made it famous and now it's just standard operating procedure but Exxon started it in the climate change realm. 

If instead, they'd published their true findings, how much policy would have been affected instead of 50 years of arguing about it? Because today is doesn't feel like it would matter. I'm not sure even if everyone understood that the science is solid on climate change if we'd have any more urgency."
todayilearned,ffsgqqc,t3_euzizn,1580181309.0,And they included his ashes on the probe that did the flyby.
todayilearned,ffsgkp5,t3_euyvsi,1580181195.0,"That article is poorly written. It says they started a mill in Redding, CA which still supplies Bob's today, then they bought a factory in Oregon City, then the ""original"" mill burned down. But I believe they're referring to OC as the mill that burned down, not Redding."
todayilearned,ffjd1a3,t1_ffjceck,1579995714.0,"I've wondered how different all our products would be if manufacturers were responsible for the entire life cycle. You wouldn't have plastics being added to waterproof paperboard in place of wax, just for one example."
todayilearned,ffj2i9r,t3_etwtpr,1579988749.0,"Six percent per capita. It seems like there is another variable missing. Because those other drinks usually cost more than water so spending on beverages went up and they're drinking more fluids per person. Although non-water is more palatable so I guess that could drive consumption. And maybe seeing people carrying around juice or soda acts like an advertisement to make other people crave it. 

Hopefully they find a solution but I do find the single-use bans specific to water and straws while ignoring all the other varieties of single use trash really frustrating. And many universities have contracts with coke or Pepsi so they're not going to get rid of soda and juice."
todayilearned,ffj22i3,t1_ffj16rw,1579988438.0,"If the use of single use bottles went up, they were probably buying more soda, energy drinks, etc. So if that's what you meant by ""properly"", yeah, but they're actually buying more fluids overall."
therewasanattempt,ffh69e8,t1_ffgdg3k,1579924271.0,"Except in many fields where they find a way to blind the decision makers as to the race and gender of the candidate, suddenly diversity rises. Which means the best person for the job wasn't being hired before. 

Humans are wired to pattern match. When VCs think of a successful startup, they think of a Harvard dropout in a hoodie so they are more favorable evaluating anyone who matches this pattern, and less favorable to actual Harvard graduates, and especially less favorable to ""diverse"" candidates. When the C suites are full of middle age white guys, that biases evaluation of future candidates. 

And some people on here are saying firefighting fitness requirements are being relaxed in an attempt to increases diversity, but there are also accounts of women and minorities being total badass firefighters, both the firefighter who spoke up about a colleague who impressed them and the Wikipedia article linked. It's likely both are true in different fire departments - in some places they may be relaxing the requirements and in some areas perfectly qualified firefighters are being rejected or harassed out of a job. 

So it's never been and will never be so simple as ""just hire the best person"" because humans are rarely rational or objective."
TheSilphRoad,ffh5apj,t3_etljmx,1579923510.0,"Sometimes. More like too time consuming to sit and battle, adjust my team, try again, etc. I like to play to get exercise and standing there for multiple rounds of battles is less fun. Plus the end reward of a mediocre legendary..."
therewasanattempt,ffg8m7j,t1_ffg72ng,1579900814.0,That's the subject of the article above.
therewasanattempt,ffg6bd7,t1_ffg59qc,1579899389.0,Literally the article we are referring to.
therewasanattempt,fffsqvo,t1_fffs0x7,1579890988.0,"How about: Some of the firefighters who don't want their boys club messed with also refuse to fight fires in ""dirty"" neighborhoods."
therewasanattempt,fffrqhi,t1_fffqsr8,1579890364.0,"I don't think you read the article either. Diverse candidates were regularly getting hired, having passed all the tests and requirements, and then harassed until they quit."
therewasanattempt,fffqtcg,t1_fffq1sg,1579889797.0,The article she's responding to the headline for rather than read.
todayilearned,fffptxd,t1_fffp215,1579889186.0,It was super entertaining when it was about the dry subject of competing theories of early humans. And butts.
therewasanattempt,fffnslp,t3_etdg3o,1579887937.0,"If you read the article, there are good reasons to need diversity in firefighting."
TheSilphRoad,fffn7a3,t3_einulo,1579887579.0,"I just picked up a Hatch 4 eggs for an encounter. I will be batch hatching this weekend so then I'll know what the pokemon is, but I haven't seen 4 eggs in any of these lists."

Wellthatsucks,ff48ecz,t1_ff47gr4,1579557781.0,Both say order 16. Is there something on the menu indicating this is a different order?
TheSilphRoad,feojhyz,t1_feog52c,1579300945.0,I have whirlipede but am grinding to get the next form so it was disappointing but on the other hand still fun to have surprises occasionally.
TheSilphRoad,fekxm3l,t1_fekxhp9,1579209708.0,I was a little disappointed since I pinap'ed the venipede...
TheSilphRoad,fekpxj0,t1_fekpgjd,1579205173.0,"But to have it show up in my journal as fled is still a little weird. I don't think that's been happening the other times though. Pretty sure the shiny Blastoise, which was the first I noticed, said caught in the journal. 

Makes sense as a potential hedging of bets."
TheSilphRoad,feknhtq,t1_fekly41,1579203724.0,"I have been meaning to pay closer attention to see if it is giving out the stardust and xp or not, but have not yet."

TheSilphRoad,feki9bi,t1_fekhxpd,1579200601.0,How would someone else catching the same thing provide proof?
TheSilphRoad,feki6cr,t1_fekhtlj,1579200553.0,"I wasn't recording my screen, so in my journal it shows I caught a ditto, but that doesn't prove what I was attempting to catch. And oddly below the ditto catch it shows the venipede ran away, probably because I've been experiencing a glitch about once a week where it shows my Pokemon break out and flee but then it's in my Pokemon bag."
Wellthatsucks,fegw4ds,t1_fegvh7n,1579103856.0,"They were trying to take an awesome picture which likely required a lot of time and effort and the result has streaks in it from satellites going by. 

Also, happy cake day."
todayilearned,fdau99p,t1_fd9igcz,1578250242.0,"I've read about a barista who had a customer like this, always needed their drink fixed no matter what, and the barista guessed it was the only time customer felt in charge in their life so barista enjoyed doing that small thing for the customer instead of resenting it."
