todayilearned,fem980w,t1_fem5sc3,1579244441.0,"From what I know, it wasn't regulations but investment that let the private companies thrive.

The government invested enough in railways that it became 100% feasible and even preferable in many urban cases to choose rail as the primary or even sole method of transit.

Once that happened, railways in populous areas had a stable commuter base and didn't have to compete against cars as much.

That and it's standard practice for the rail company to own the station and all the land around it. With many people solely relying on trains, stations become prime real estate and the train companies profit. It also synergizes well since they have to make train service good to attract people to their lands filled with shops and offices.

Stuff like, ""Oh I chose to live here because X train companies train line is so much better than Y train companies lines"" is a pretty common consideration, and the train companies and lines are so numerous and overlapped that cross shopping on the basis of which train line you want is perfectly possible.

For reference, I live in the Tokyo metropolitan area, I have a choice of 3 separate train companies to take me downtown and I chose to primarily use one because of its extensive network and ease of transfers. The other lines had other advantages such as being cheaper or getting me to downtown slightly faster at the cost of more inconvienent transfers.

> 'Into the warp I went, fifteen thousand years ago. Cast adrift by the storms that wracked the galaxy as man's apotheosis drew near. Deep, deep into time I was sent. I have seen the beginning, when the warp was first breached and the slow death of the galaxy began. I have seen the end when Chaos swallows all. I know the fate of mankind. You are not equipped to prevent it, and we sought to warn you of what approaches. Do you know what happened, primitive, when I eventually emerged from the warp? For the first time I was thousands of years, not millions, from my original starting point. My captain, a brave and resourceful man, seized the chance and made for the nearest human outpost with all speed. Imagine his dismay when, rather than a welcome and a wise heeding of warnings, he found your savage, devolved king squatting in the ruins of our civilisation. He was taken; bondmate, my friend.

I knew it would only be a matter of time before I attracted the attention of your brutal dictatorship. I thank you for clearing me of this infestation of monsters.

In Hakone, the Tsubaki Line, Yugawara Park Way are also good. Also don't forget the main Hakone Touge road.

Also it will be completely out of the way for your current itinerary, but the R246 back from Hakone to Tokyo is definitely the most enjoyable drive back to the Yokohama area (though after this point it becomes a multi lane heavily congested main road).
