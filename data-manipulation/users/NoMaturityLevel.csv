coolguides,felbjam,t1_fekvjjb,1579218317.0,Lmao talking about the diagrams in the guide. There ain't no other features so your argument is just a new argument and not a counter. Debate!
coolguides,fekutat,t1_fekmevi,1579208046.0,"That's fine, go away.

You're still using other features to orient yourself, you just dont want to admit it. And by doing that you've changed the condition of my statement, congratulations, you know words. I'll say it til I die, contours alone dont tell anything except that theres a change in elevation (see exception at the end). You dont know how big the jump is, you dont know in which direction, unless you have labels. You could even have two contours of the exact same elevation right next to each other and never know because there's no actual numbers."

coolguides,fejje1d,t1_fej3xu4,1579176754.0,"Lucky you to be looking at both the map and the site. I'm a civil engineer and while yes I can deduce A LOT from just contours, if those contours aren't labeled then you really dont know if you're looking at a steep slope or an over-contoured map. Furthermore, without outside knowledge of the site (by being there or thru pictures or a survey of features or thru google maps like I usually do) then theres no way of knowing if the slope goes up or down without labels. Like the guide above, ALL of those topo diagrams could have been valleys. Every single one."
coolguides,fej290q,t1_fej1g6l,1579154220.0,"Not at all. Contours are contours. If theres any distinction then it's between major and minor contours (usually major contours are every 5, minors are in between, but this depends on the scale). But I've never seen a topographical map with ""little lines jotting inward"", I'm thinking you were looking at a drainage map instead.
But still, if a topo doesn't have labels it's useless. You could be looking at 10 ft increments or 0.01 ft increments."

pics,fdk8exo,t1_fdk4fio,1578498431.0,Honestly this sounds like a cultural/linguistics thing. I WOULD call it a train. Id more likely call it a light-rail.
pics,fdk8b5j,t1_fdk5ogi,1578498362.0,"I beg to differ. What's the big difference between trams and trains..the length? The number of cars?? By definition, a train is a rail vehicle that pulls a load, which fall into 2 categories: freight and passenger. Trams fall under the passenger trains category. And yes they're all rail vehicles. 

A better comparison between car and train would be car : train :: electric car : tram.

Also consider 
local bus : tram :: greyhound : amtrak

Edit: I looked further into ""trams"" and found their origin is from the coal cars used in mines. Trams are also referred to as streetcars or light-rail. And then I find the name of the Mexico City tram system: Tren Ligero (light train). Maybe we're disagreeing because of deeper language barriers here."
