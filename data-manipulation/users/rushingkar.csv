tasker,ffbbw22,t3_eson03,1579758964.0,"From what I understand:

1-4 are all False. 

ADB Wifi is a method of allowing Tasker to run commands it used to need root for. You have normal permissions, and above that you have ADB, and at the top you have root permissions. Before this update, Tasker could only access regular and root. The addition of ADB wifi opens some of the root level commands to regular users.

You only need to plug into a computer to initiate the ADB Wifi. Basically, Android can receive some commands through ADB. Normally, ADB is only used when you plug your phone into a computer, but ADB wifi (is it new?) allows the same thing. Tasker is exploiting this. Instead of a computer sending (through USB) a command to Android to (let's say) kill an app, Tasker can send that command instead. 

Unfortunately, Tasker isn't allowed to send that command by default. So we have to plug the phone into the computer and give Tasker permission to send it. This only has to happen once per *phone* reboot. After you run 'adb tcpip 5555' (the command that gives Tasker permission to run ADB commands) you can unplug the phone and use it as normal. If you reboot the phone, ADB Wifi commands will not work until you re-grant Tasker the permissions to run ADB commands (by plugging it in and running 'adb tcpip 5555' again.

The WiFi part of it is just a way to trick Android into thinking the ADB command came from another device over Wifi. It doesn't really care that Tasker on the device is sending it, because Tasker is spoofing itself using the tcpip (I'm still unsure of this part)

If you remember jailbreaking in the early 2010s, this is effectively a ""tethered jailbreak"", but the only limitation is you can't use ADB commands until you tether. The rest of the phone is still usable."

bayarea,ff8crt9,t3_es77sa,1579673186.0,"I went to high school in Fremont. I think it's mostly the immense pressure to do well. The parents fed the pressure into the kids, and it definitely showed. It wasn't just ""My parents are making me do all this extra work"", it was ""I am doing all this extra work (so I can get into a good college, etc)"". Honestly, most of the time it seemed like the only reason people had that mentality was to get into a good college. In high school, that was the only end goal. My high school certainly felt like it was just college prep. I think we sent 30 something kids to UC Berkeley, and another couple dozen to UCLA (of a class of 500 something)?

It's definitely a culture of ""if you're not doing as well as everyone else, you're not as good as them"" and the kids absolutely perpetuate that culture. 

As for what kind of homework and projects and studying make it hard, I'd say it's again the pressure. I didn't experience high school outside Fremont, so I don't know what others went through. But the homework on its own isn't terrible - it's the pressure of doing as good or better than your peers that makes it hard. Of course, when you pile up on AP classes + sports + volunteering + more AP classes, the workload naturally adds up (and I have no doubt a lot of people did those just to look good to colleges, not because they actually liked it)."
