aww,ff1lgxx,t3_er2ldm,1579481114.0,I love the initial  “Oh!” to the final “Ohhhh nice- Very very nice” reaction.

aww,fdpt4v6,t1_fdpqroo,1578639449.0,"Listening to Travis actually helped me branch musically, so I’m real glad for that. Recently, I got into Kaytranada! My cat, April, purrs against my phone when I play “What You Need” by him. Don’t know if it is the tone or just BPM, but she loves it.  It is super cute and gets me every time.


It is the best feeling when you and your cat share a similar taste in music."
aww,fdpqev9,t3_emi7xm,1578636581.0,"Astro now looks at you as if you are his world. Thank you for sharing this!

Sidenote: Also big Travis Scoot fan! I worked so many shifts to pay for my ticket to ASTROWORLD. It was incredibly hard (juggling uni classes)  but so worth it. Hope you also get a chance to see him live!!"

aww,fdou9le,t3_emczxe,1578613014.0,This may come off as real dumb but I have to ask: Are snails able to metabolize the juices of the tomato through their skin? Because it looks like it!
Giraffesdontexist,fdnt7hd,t1_fdn0vl7,1578592348.0,"What I enjoy for this clip is that life lessons are analyzed. The perspective of the lions: teamwork, the giraffe: perseverance, and even the videographer who gives us a chance to look at everything in different ways. 

As someone who chose to support the giraffe (given my name), I wanted to see the positive outlook. Though, those of you who reminded me about the lions truly winning- keep me grounded. So thank you!"

aww,fdktqw8,t3_elu52b,1578510975.0,The two deers are totally working together- one is polite and distracts expertly while the other tries to hunt/steal from behind. They meet at an undisclosed corner to reap rewards and discuss how to improve. Pure genius (and highly adorable).

Bumble,fd0iv6h,t1_fczh1m4,1578119439.0,"I usually ask them what kind of tea they drink/like! If they don’t like coffee, tea or juice, I usually respond with “Water you doing about your drink choices?!” And then they either respond snidely or ghost."
Bumble,fcz36ip,t1_fcz2a5u,1578092732.0,Thank you! Cheers to the new year and hopefully new experiences.
