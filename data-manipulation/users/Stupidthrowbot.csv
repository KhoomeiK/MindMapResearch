ABoringDystopia,fgai6ld,t1_fg8gr80,1580651500.0,It always shocks me how some people can be so eloquent or funny but so racist at the same time.
facepalm,fg2pl27,t1_fg2kyia,1580450975.0,"Well it's kind of impossible to live without identifying race on some subconcious level. It's what you do with it that matters.  


But yeah screw like whoring."

TIHI,ffglbc0,t1_ffg1xjc,1579908875.0,"I hope this is ironic.

It is ok to dislike someone for bragging about sexual harassment, inventing a group of moderate right-wingers at a Neo-Nazi protest, then went back on his apology for it, obstructed his own court trial, said there were ""presumably some good people"" in a country, blocked an entire population from travel, set up a system that resulted in the deaths of several children, hired Steve Bannon and constantly averts any and all criticism from himself, right?"

TopMindsOfReddit,ff2g0gx,t1_ff0ldxo,1579504544.0,"Thing that started as a fun theory is now accepted as obvious reality. They will fight each other over ""how things actually changed."" They will ban you if you try and say that an objective reality exists because it's ""insulting other people's experience.""

I once tried to explain to them that ""in the real reality I was never banned,"" they didn't like that lmao."

TheRightCantMeme,ff2fjnj,t1_feog0ll,1579504000.0,"It's not ""stupidly in depth"" it's the same level of depth as the average political cartoon. Showing a situation in a mocking way."
TheRightCantMeme,fenylmv,t1_feno784,1579292665.0,"He's saying ""there are two genders"" would get the Nazi to not attack him and it's supposed to seem ridiculous thus proving that two genders people aren't really Nazis."

TopMindsOfReddit,feh1tlb,t1_feddyo2,1579107376.0,"Oh yeah, I already knew about his hate speech and M&Ms dispensary. I just didn't connect it to this. I personally don't hate on him for the M&M dispensary but it's clear that money didn't buy him happiness.

I still have some sympathy for him though, his post about his Dad's suicide was one of the most touching things I've ever read."
