bipolar,fdxlptn,t3_en1nb9,1578770269.0,This is fucking incredible. I can feel your mood.
pastlives,fdwoap6,t1_fdwni1e,1578760794.0,I just googled what that is and yes she feels like that. I saw her during an acid trip a few years ago. Like her energy not her physically idk does that mean anything
pastlives,fdwlinz,t1_fdwf84o,1578759890.0,I will!
CPTSD,fdsda25,t1_f6ltqp3,1578700010.0,I am in a similar boat. How are you coping with the feelings of doing things you would not do just to be the perfect partner? I'm struggling with this
bipolar,fdqpqy4,t1_fdp6bk0,1578672235.0,Thanks
bipolar,fdobaz0,t3_emdt9q,1578602090.0,"Seriously though, how do neurotypicals live like that?"
CPTSD,fckxpy5,t1_fckwkgy,1577735439.0,"Yes, it used to happen all the time. It’s starting to happen again mid conversation. I have moments where I am in my head but I can still sort of remember what happened but being more aware of this amnesia is starting to trip me out."
CPTSD,fckvsgg,t1_fckvha1,1577734263.0,Is it normal to have no recollection like I didn’t exist for those moments in time?
bipolar2,fcidp34,t3_eh9al9,1577661007.0,I feel so seen LMAO
CPTSD,fcfybd0,t1_fcfkmbj,1577634783.0,Ugh I feel that. I’m glad you’re working on it. I have a hard time connecting with healthy people also lol maybe in time.
CPTSD,fcfkim0,t1_fccq4xj,1577630885.0,It’s such a shitty thing to tell someone who’s been sexually abused. There’s plenty of parts of our lives that feel out of control (at least mine) and it so painful thinking our sexuality is just a consequence of the abuse.
CPTSD,fcfjtvj,t1_fcd0oby,1577630659.0,How did you work through those trust issues to build those kinds of friendships?
CPTSD,fcfj5fc,t1_fce7jvx,1577630547.0,I love that. “You were gay in the womb” thanks I’m going to think of that when I start doubting the validity of my sexuality.
CPTSD,fcch4p8,t1_fccfm0x,1577598323.0,Thanks I needed to hear that
CPTSD,fccdzhd,t1_fccdcx7,1577597312.0,I hate the confusion... I hate how much trauma has influenced my sexuality at least my perception of it. I feel so corrupted it sucks.
bipolar2,fcca0sh,t3_egwvt9,1577596035.0,This is amazing. I can feel it.
bipolar2,fc95eqq,t1_fc954xp,1577547318.0,Ah stay safe I hope you figure it out soon
bipolar2,fc6tudn,t3_eghn37,1577489342.0,Wow! This is so beautiful! I’m glad you’re finding some sort of relief :)
bipolar,fc6to7s,t3_egfib7,1577489217.0,Very beautiful!!
bipolar2,fc6fosz,t1_fc6er1c,1577479476.0,It does sound like a good job. I’m definitely going to look into it. Thanks!
bipolar2,fc6bd1q,t1_fc67j9o,1577476616.0,Thanks for answering. How’s the drug testing?
CPTSD,fc5x2n0,t1_fc5vxm3,1577467707.0,Thanks it’s really rewarding but it definitely took long to feel like this. I’m glad all the therapy is paying off.
bipolar,fc5itdm,t3_eg7wlx,1577458770.0,Amazing. I love this.
bipolar,fc0ks81,t3_efhnhh,1577293201.0,Congrats!!! That’s amazing news you should be very proud of yourself!!!
