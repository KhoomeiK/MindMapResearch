unpopularopinion,fesis27,t3_eqig84,1579365665.0,I partially agree. I think root beer tastes good but to me soda doesn’t really quench my thirst
unpopularopinion,fdwd5d8,t3_en89gc,1578757539.0,Are they adult chicken nuggets? Yes. Do I care? No. Will I continue to order them? Yes. I like the occasional normal bone in wing but I usually prefer boneless. Also there are places near me that do call them nuggets.
unpopularopinion,fdwckk8,t3_en8o0l,1578757345.0,Following astrology in general is stupid. Like why does it matter if you’re a Leo or cancer or whatever. It has no significance and horoscopes just make crap up anyways.
unpopularopinion,fdwba4z,t3_en8s85,1578756960.0,The remaining monarchies of the world should be abolished
unpopularopinion,fdo5ybv,t3_ememwc,1578599476.0,"Depends on the situation. If it’s someone chiming in that has no reason to chime in (like they aren’t a family member or friend or acquaintance that knows what’s going on or a stranger that has been in the same situation for whatever is being argued about) then they shouldn’t chime in. If someone is someone with experience or is relevant to the argument then yeah chime in and bring up your point especially if it’s something the other two parties didn’t think of and could possibly diffuse the severity of the situation in particularly bad arguments.   

TLDR; only if they are relevant to the argument"

unpopularopinion,fcsa9tr,t1_fcs1s7r,1577913701.0,I still think it’s a stupid idea to suggest that it should be mandatory because I’d never follow that law anyways. So again I disagree with you and will never do that. Thank you
unpopularopinion,fcrxf4z,t3_eimojd,1577907946.0,Unless I’m specifically craving McDonald’s I’d take any Burger King burger over any McDonald’s burger
unpopularopinion,fcqvvnr,t3_eijek3,1577892998.0,I disagree with you there sir/madam. I don’t think the government shouldn’t force me to use lights during the day and I don’t think we should buy new cars based on having it or not. I use lights during nighttime driving and low visibility driving but I shouldn’t have to use them during the day and I currently don’t. If the sun is out we can see.

hockeyjerseys,fab3jqe,t3_e8cvv9,1575917252.0,If someone wants to buy a fake jersey that’s fine I won’t judge since people have different budgets but I personally would rather save up longer and buy a real one.
