unpopularopinion,ff8ai1i,t1_ff89zhq,1579670920.0,"My point though, is that the society and lifestyle enjoyed by the rich and powerful is only possible because of what you call underachievers. Without the working class, without people like you, the whole system falls apart. So how can we say that a truck driver is less important than a CEO? Without the truck driver to transport goods, it doesn't matter how ambitious the CEO is. Furthermore, without their employees, they're nobody. 

Take Jeff Bezos. His success is contingent on the labor of countless individuals. You simply cannot say that he earned it all himself because all his profits rely on the people actually making deliveries and producing goods. Without them, he's nothing."

Again, I am usually 100% in support of an armed working class but domestic abusers are just statistically more likely to commit other crimes and acts of violence. 

All this to say, yes. I think a registry would be a great idea, but only just the beginning if I had my way. 

As a little caveat, I will say that this would all hinge upon a complete overhaul of how our justice system handles domestic abuse from the sentencing down to the cops themselves. I've known several people in my life who dealt with domestic abuse and none of them felt very supported by our current justice system. 

It's sort of like the classic argument about how you can end up as a sex offender for taking a piss behind a dumpster. I'd be afraid that people might end up on the registry who didn't belong there. Of course that's just because of the complete lack of trust in police and the justice system as a whole. 

So yeah, but it would require a lot of redesigning to actually be feasible. There would have to be some sense that the police, prosecutors and judges were actually serving the public good. As it stands, we have very little indication of that being the case."
