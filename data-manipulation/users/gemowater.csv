I understand that doing it in mono-blue would seem out of place, but I think that using hybrid mana in the case of this custom card as well as flavoring it well would make it not feel weird."

custommagic,fffmu9j,t1_fff85mk,1579887360.0,"This is a card draw effect, it's in blue. The question is does it fit in black, and I think so.

EDIT: To clarify, blue can get unconditional card draw every turn, so restricting it at all doesn't change the fact that it is still a blue effect.

Blue can draw cards regardless of conditions.

Black can draw cards when creatures die.

Therefore, blue/black overlap in drawing cards when creatures die.
