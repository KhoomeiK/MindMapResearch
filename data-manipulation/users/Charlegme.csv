IndiaSpeaks,fg0tqeh,t3_ew4ewn,1580414840.0,"Okay? And this is relevant to India how, exactly?"
india,fg0ntym,t1_ffzon8o,1580411555.0,"Oh, on the contrary, someone who likes to describe themself as a 'patriot' tends to be the opposite of a good person."
wiedzmin,fg0no5q,t3_etxn7v,1580411461.0,Lol it's so hilarious watching this entire sub have its month-long meltdown over the sight of PoC in the show.
ProgrammerHumor,fg0eid8,t1_fg055yq,1580406118.0,"Exactly. In our company, when the tester finds something going wrong she usually assigns the issue to the frontend team. If they investigate and find it's a backend issue, they can always reassign it."
ProgrammerHumor,fg0e695,t1_ffzix7f,1580405917.0,No.

Paladins,ffzlsqf,t3_evsf3c,1580385171.0,Will never not upvote my big tiddy goth gf.
Paladins,ffzlrrb,t1_ffyl90u,1580385140.0,"Google ""La Llorona"" if you want to know more (there's also a kinda crappy Hollywood  movie made on the legend, would advise you to skip it unless you're really into cheesy horror)."
netflixwitcher,ffz614n,t1_fbwdy7w,1580365117.0,"Good news is you can come back now. It's become a much better place since the release of the show. I think the influx of all the new Witcher fans pushed out the closet racists, most of whom seem to have migrated to r/wiedzmin."
wiedzmin,ffz5mno,t1_ffvezpn,1580364783.0,Thanks for just proving their point lol.
delhi,ffz2drp,t1_ffz1lnm,1580361727.0,"One word: Delhi Metro. Regardless of which government is in power, the public transport in Delhi is way ahead of that in Bangalore. And I say this as a person who has stayed in both cities."
delhi,ffxhpqw,t1_ffx84wd,1580325376.0,Don't see how that makes it better but ok.
bangalore,ffxfbnb,t1_ffxeiez,1580323994.0,"Oh, I agree with you. Downvotes are supposed to be for badly structured/irrelevant/abusive comments, not simply something you disagree with. But that's Reddit for you."
bangalore,ffxe1f8,t1_ffw2uf1,1580323238.0,">Not sure why you are being downvoted?

Eh, I'm not surprised. When you go to any sub and criticize the main topic of that sub, you shouldn't be surprised by the downvotes. But I don't think I've said anything wrong.

india,ffw9qym,t3_ev71f1,1580291347.0,"First we should make abortions legal and available on demand, no questions asked. Then make condoms and birth control pills free and easily available. Maybe also give tax benefits to people who have vasectomies. And encourage adoption of orphans. If these measures are unsuccessful then we can think about a two-child policy law."
india,ffw9kbt,t1_ff3dqqb,1580291066.0,Because that's where this governments priorities lie.

freefolk,fft2pa3,t1_ffsi4b1,1580203868.0,Exactly. Season 4-5 was roughly the time they began to run out of source material from the books and D&D were forced to write their own story and dialogue. And we all saw how that turned out.

india,ffst3wl,t1_ffj1r6y,1580191470.0,"Yes. And other types of crime as well. Combined with the other 'cow belt' states (Bihar,  MP, etc) it's responsible for most of India's bad image."
IndiaSpeaks,ffssyl2,t1_ffrnmq6,1580191318.0,Exactly. This country is a lost cause. Better to get out while you still can.

india,ffrce0z,t1_ffr8134,1580155147.0,"Yes, UCC is needed. It is ridiculous that in a seemingly secular country we have separate laws for separate religions.

BUT (and this is a big but) it has to be done fairly, without any ulterior motives, not designed to benefit Hindus and trample minorities under the guise of equality, and that's not something I trust this government to be able to do."
