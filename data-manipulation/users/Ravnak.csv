My friend and I tried out MHW on PC and enjoyed it, but struggled with two things:  


1. The ""lobby"" system. Which was an absoloute pain to get into a game together. (Lots of faffing about to get into friends games)  

2. The scaling. Where 2player was just harder than 1player? On several fights we just had to split up as it was much easier to drop a monster on your own with its reduced damage.

trashy,fcpsnlj,t1_fcoucs4,1577871268.0,"Control over the platform isn't really a must. So many industries rely on something they don't control. Especially media ones. You make a TV show, you don't control if next season gets greenlit. You quarry green slate, you don't control if people want to stock purple this season instead.

Also, the important thing so far has been that the platform has been enabling their income entirely. I can't name one famous youtuber who would be able to make money without youtube.

More to the point though: they ARE addressing it. Thats the whole point. Youtube are becoming very restrictive.  People are seeking a way to do their job on a new platform before Youtube do something to them."

You will land somewhere on the left/right spectrum as a candidate. And depending on what the public currently want, you'll win or lose.

We always end up letting extremists dictate policy, then when it turns out they suck, going the other way.

eg. Indian curry is primarily a tomato, onion and garlic base, with a spice based flavour profile built in a pan and then stirred together.  


Once you learn the sauce, (which is very easy) you can cook about 30 curries by just adding the right spice.  


There are some great cookbooks out there, and I'm also a big fan of these guys for chinese:

No... I'm realistic. The script is bad, the cast doesn't work, the four people don't mesh into a funny unit, they just fight each other for laughs that they don't get because the characters aren't good, and its just a lazy rehash of the first film to keep it safe.  


Oh, and the comedy style is absolutely ""comedy chic-flick"", but its a nerdy sci-fi/comedy, meaning youve written a movie for one demographic, but stuck it in a genre that they don't typically watch.

He described a culture of paranoia and fear amongst the management that not pandering to the SJWs of the internet would ruin the comics.  
Various staff provided evidence over and over that the general public never bought the tacky, rebranded WOKE reimaginings of superheros. (ie. lady thor, etc.) because they had no idea who they were. They wanted Tony stark, and Peter Parker, and didn't see girl versions as the same thing.  


Suggestions that someone sit down and simply write good female characters were shot down in flames, as ""the internet"" demanded that Doctor Strange become a Black Woman with disabilities, and by god imagine the repercussions if we don't immediately do that!
