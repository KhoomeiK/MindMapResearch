A few years ago my brother got all uppity and told is he didn't want any more Star Wars t-shirts. I say uppity because we were genuinely buying him nice t-shirts, not random shit, and my dad als loves Star Wars and loved buying him those shirts.

Well we listened to him. No Star Wars themed clothing
But this was the year the Force Awakens was released so so the merchandising was at its peak. He only forbidden clothing, so we decided to buy him every random ass thing (mostly food) that wasn't clothing and gift wrap every single one individally and put them under the tree (he also got real gifts, this was a gag gift). 

We were psyched to fuck with him Christmas morning...except we went to my aunt's for Christmas Eve. She did the exact same thing, bought him every random ass cereal box and can of soup with Star Wars in it, except it was a genuine effort at gift giving, not a gag gift. 

Tbh, it did kind if make our orange k the next morning even funnier. 

My aunt is also a notoriously bad gift giver, though, who puts no thought into them. Like one year after I joined a sorority who had owls as mascots she bought me a ton of shit with owls on them, including an owl shaped candle holder...I'm allergic to candles. 

She also had no concept of age. Like last year she got a Star Wars children's picture book out of the library for my brother, who's in his late 20s, so he could read it and then got really disappointed that he wouldn't."

Also I'm not sure misuse of that law is as common today as you think it is. Has Affirmative Action been misused in the last? Yes, and that is why the Supreme Court has ruled what is and isn't okay. Looking at the wholistically nature if someone is okay. Requiring X amount of people with Y background, applying ""points"" to applicants with certain backgrounds and then re wa hiring candidates to earn a certain amount if points, etc. are not okay.

By the way, the wholistic background makes things such as considering extracurricular activities, employment history, legacy status, basically everything is isn't just a grade or test score, legal to look at and consider."

Yeah, I *still* need to go back to school for my masters if I want to actually go into my chosen field.

BAs aren't special anymore, and yet nearly all employers who aren't service industries require them. For the good jobs you need masters now, or a shit load of experience, which is ridiculous. I get paid $13 an hour, no benefits, and was required a bachelors to do this job. Entry level jobs no longer exist, which is a whole other issue.

AskReddit,ff9nakj,t1_ff8gz4p,1579716572.0,"So everyone in Wyoming lives in your neighborhood? Doubt it. Also bot every state school may offer your course of study. For many this means paying expensive out of state prices to get into the right program. Luckily where I live if your state does not offer your program you can go to any other New England state school and pay your own in state, but those people certainly can't commute. 

Also a long but ""doable"" commute to school *sucks*. You might be on campus for *hours* between classes with not ability to take a break at your house because it's too far away to quickly stop by. Remeber picking a schedule only has so much leeway, you must make sacrifices to get into the right classes for graduating. Sometimes a class you need is only offered at 8 AM and another you need is only offered at 5 PM. You're food options are limited because you don't have access to your own food. It's also just miserable. I did a commute like that *part time* and that alone was shitty. I know I never would had graduated if I had to do that full time. Let's not pretend that shitty situations like that, such as long commutes and long days away from your house doesn't effect your ability to graduate. Also those things can effect your ability to hold down a job while in school, which for many is another obstacle for  graduating.

It's not so simply as you can technically do this and graduate with less debt. If doing that is going to make your life miserable and risk you ability to attend classes or do well in school then its not a proper solution."
AskReddit,ff8gcir,t1_ff88ikd,1579677246.0,That's actually a common misconception. A lot of people think that if they make enough money to get into the next tax bracket *all* they money will be taxed at that rate and they'll actually end up with less money before they got a raise. But that's not how tax brackets work. It's all the money *within* that bracket that gets taxed.
AskReddit,ff8fyd1,t1_ff85edz,1579676767.0,"Tuition alone at my college is $14,500 for in-state students. That is just for a regular, run of the mill degree at my school. Some programs include additional fees. Engineer students must pay an additional $500 per semester. Nursing students must pay an additional $850 per semester for years 2-4. And starting their third year, pharmacy students must pay either $1,375 per semester (for students in the four-year program) or $3,250 (for students in the six-year program)

Those costs are ridiculous. But they are far from the only thing that is ridiculous about the cost of a college education. You dismiss the cost of room and board, but those are also an issue. Students have to live somewhere and for students living too far from their parents' home to commute that often means student housing. Some schools even make living on campus during their freshman year mandatory.

Those living on campus have to eat. Many colleges make a dining plan mandatory if you live on campus. My college made it madatory with the only exception being given to students living in ensuite dorms with private kitchen (only 2 out of the 29 dorms had this).

The most basic room and board package at my school is $12,700. And that's form a tiny ass triple room, a bathroom down a hall and crappy dining hall food. That adds up to about $1,800 a month. Oh, and these ""amazing"" dorms aren't even open to students during the whole school year.  At some schools, you aren't allowed to use the dorms during Thanksgiving break or spring break. It doesn't matter if you have a long commute to get home or can't afford it. Better cozy up on a park bench because that expensive room you're paying a shit load to stay in is closed.

Then there's the cost of books, which is also out of control.

52book,fe2m6xp,t3_enn4ig,1578840403.0,"I finished reading **The Testaments** by Margaret Atwood and **Wishful Drinking** by Carrie Fisher. 

The Testaments was *so* amazing. I just flew through it. I loved learn more about Atwood's Gilead and what happened after the Handmaid's Tale ended.

Meanwhile Wishful Drinking just reminded me how much I love Carrie Fisher (and how much I miss her). She was an absolutely amazing individual, and so freaking funny. Yes, her life was quite outlandish at time, especially her childhood, but the way she viewed the world felt so familiar. Her insecurity, her self-deprecation, her need to be loved, her inability to shut the fuck up or keep things to herself--that's me. I've never felt so personally connected to someone else's struggles before. I've always loved Carrie Fisher because she was Leia, and I was obsessed with her character as a kid and wanted to be just like her, but now I know I *am* just like the *real* person and someone that's better. 

RIP Carrie. You'll always live on in my heart.

I'm also reading **the Princess Diarist** also by Carrie Fisher, though this one was specially about working in Star Wars, and the novelization of **The Force Awakens** by Alan Dean Forster 

The Princess Diarist made me realist I might have a crush on Harrison Ford, though I'm sure that's just because I was seeing him through Carrie's eyes. I swear half of that book is just about her affair with Harrison...which was interesting but I wished it got into some more behubd the scenes stuff. 

TFA novel is...well a bit boring at times. Tbh I'm reading it as fanfiction research, lol. I want to better understand the sequel trilogy characters for my fanfics. It's just very dry and there are many new things it's added to the movie, at least so far. So far there's been an extra scene with Poe and an extra scene with Leia, a little more dialogue and some insight into some characters heads during various scenes, but really it's kind of a struggling

I built it so it worked for me. For example, I made up a weekly schedule because my schedule week to week was often vastly different with variing hours. Last year my dailies were literally just the date plus all my tasks/appointments/notes for the day. It was more like a to-do list. I'm changing that up this year and I'll see if something else works better for me. Also, this year, now that I've been doing a bullet journal for a little over a year I bought more items. I have a circle stencil. I have fitness themed stickers. I have way more spreads.

Start small. Buy the minimum items you need and just buy new things *as you need them*. Also keep your spreads small. Don't go overboard until you're used to the system and know what else you need help with. The bullet journal is designed to adapt to what *you* need *when* you need it. 

As for what journal to buy to start with, since I started my first journal in November my friends suggested I started with any old notebook to see if I'd actall stick with it, and then to reward myself with a nicer one if I was still doing it that January. But January really does feel like a good starting month so if you really want to do this I'd say splurg a little and get a nicish notebook. But you have to think about what you want. Do you care about ghosting? Do you want dots, grids or lines? What size? Come up with a list of the things you want in a notebook and then find a notebook to match that instead of looking through endless recommendation lists."

[Here's mine, btw](https://imgur.com./a/EqfqmyX). I read a lot more than six books (I think I reached 24) but that's a pic from early last year. I don't want to go hunting down my 2019 journal for a pic right now so I just found an old picture of the spread on my phone.  I remade it for 2020, but it's empty right now."

GilmoreGirls,fcvzg0r,t1_fcvxhns,1578013619.0,"Lots of Veronica Mars spoilers ahead: 

He was am extremely troubled 17 year old when he did that.

By season 4 he's in his 30s and has *seriously* gotten his life together despite what life has thrown at him. Seriously: abusive father,  dead girlfriend, murderous father, orphaned by 18 through very traumatic means. High school was fucking Hell for that kid. 

And despite that by season 4 he's a mature responsible adult. He's really happy with where he is in life, from a job that he loves to a girlfriend who he loves. He's also dealing with his issues (how can we blame him of all people for having iasues?) with therapy. He's a genuinely sweet guy who loves Veronica and has fully redeemed himself for the jackass behavior he committed as fucked up teen."

Yeah, I loved Gone Girl so much that I went through and ran *all* the author's books."
