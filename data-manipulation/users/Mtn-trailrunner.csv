regulated output like on my BD storm has been best. I don't think the belt think is that great, having done so much stuff including climbing with headlamp. a belt just seems uncomfortable and cost of them currently seem ridiculous to me. I know some people love them, but personally I'm skeptical. People are very susceptible to marketing and herd mentality. But if you can try and take it back risk free, then why not. 

hope that helps."
BarefootRunning,ffdwrsw,t3_esph1x,1579830854.0,"I wasn't sure what your were asking, as I didn't see a question just a statement yesterday. So let me say I have been enjoying my Sandals, they are locally made here in T land, although the material of sole seems to be already wearing out. I'll probably try pay the expensive price and get luna's next.

anywhoo, the xero's are like paper thin soles, so I could see them being a lot better for you, if your sandals that your ordered don't work out. They also have a great warrantee policy. Like my buddy here in T-land doesn't run, has had them for a few years called them to get some new ones. They said oh, well if your are wearing out and still under their x miles policy. they are actually paying shipping and sending him a pair here. I was quite surprised. hope that helps."
AmazfitBip,ffdvmuf,t1_ffdtow9,1579830046.0,"Yea me too, you'd think the error would be more consistent. I'm sure having one research if we looked into it we might be able to.
     
and to correct myself a bit the better ones in amazfit and garmin, suunto ect, have more consistent error. usually around 10 to 20bpm off during exercise.. However it could be anywhere within that range as I understand it.

if they had more lights, or increased the power like a pulse ox that they put on your finger at doctors, it just very battery intensive. 

further more let me show some personal history. I had a MI otherwise known as heart attack. and had to closely monitor my hr when exercising. So I had great confidence as well as my doctors because they are 1 to 2 bpm from ekg. 

and from this I used a hr monitor and gps watch religiously for next few years, but then when they finally broke and I know longer needed to be concerned about my hr. I realized that it's just a stupid metric, that isn't important at all. like so many features on these watches we get caught up in the marketing and tech and ooooh shiny. 

So now I use the bip to more monitor my resting hr change, from previous days workout. Like if I'm feeling worked and my resting hr higher than normal then maybe I need to rest or not work out as hard. I realized this from listening to David Goggins  talking about active recovery.

Now you can disagree, or maybe you are trying to be more scientific with your training, then ok. Probably wear a chest strap then."

AmazfitBip,ffdq40w,t3_et245l,1579826261.0,"Yea so a couple things, Wrist based hr isn't accurate to begin with. It works like a spectrophotometer (you can look it up) but essentially your blood pumping overwhelms the device. More lights (sensors) add to accuracy and or more powerful lights. So they are fairly accurate at low resting to very light exercise. but as soon as you start jogging not so much.

The bip states to be worn 2 inches above wrist which is different than normal watch position. it does seem a little better there. but it's fairly random when I'm working out. there are times when I look down and it says 164 and I'm like that makes sense I guess. They there are time when I'm absolutely dying and it say 74. So it's more for walking and resting hr than anything.
   
get yourself a chest strap and pair to your phone if you want real accuracy. Even garmin, and main brand one aren't that accurate. Which is why things like VO2 measurements in watches are a joke."

However if I use a irrigating nasal saline spray. It makes a huge difference. 
       Also adaptation is huge. If you can travel to higher elevation even on weekends say like up to 8000 ft it's going to make a difference in my experience. If you can get up in leadville area and train 2weeks prior you'll actually have time to adapt. Also if you never been at that elevation and go up too quickly expect acute mountain sickness.

When I lived and trained in Ouray, So many idiots came up directly from sea level to run these races without having ever even ran a 50 let alone ever been at any altitude. It's just setting yourself up for complete failure.
   So train train train, and get to altitude as much and for as long as you can before the race. good luck.

a couple other things that I realize training as climber, and getting into running that help. Knowing the rest step, even doing a faster version of it. Slow and steady wins over speed in the Alpine unless your Uli Steck. And forced exhalation in combination with those, I believe freedom of the hills calls it the mountaineers purse.  You should look them up. They have helped me both in running and in getting up mountains."
