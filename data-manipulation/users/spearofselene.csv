I'm sure someone as intelligent (/s) as yourself knows teenage girls are the most insecure, so you find them an easy target. Truth is, these 'vulnerable' groups are much stronger than an individual like you who try to bring down strangers online."
AskReddit,ff9xinn,t3_esa70e,1579723656.0,"Green Eggs and Ham. I've lost count of how many people I've begged to watch it. I got my best friend and my dad to like it!

For a show based of a Seuss book, it's suprisingly heartfelt. Who would've thought that a show like this could give us accurate and respectful portrayals of depression (which I relate super hard to), bonding of a mother and daughter, tragic backstories, plot twists that are foreshadowed from the very beginning, and INSANE emotional delivery?

It took me a bit to decide to watch it after my girlfriend wanted me to, cause I didn't have the energy to get into a new show. But whoops, I ended up watching almost all 13 episodes in one night.

Also, Adam Devine is Sam-I-Am and he does an amazing job. The cast is full of big names and they really bring life into the show."
