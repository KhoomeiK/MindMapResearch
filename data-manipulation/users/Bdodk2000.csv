If Bernie becomes president, he doesn't just become president of the base Bernie supporters. He becomes the president of ALL Americans, including Rogan and the folks in Rogan's fanbase. For Bernie's supporters to ask Bernie to shun Rogan is to basically ask Bernie to turn his back on a good number of Americans, which is not what a true leader should be doing."

Like the other guy said, though, tanks are generally there to displace people, not kill. I really do like GNB's AOE heavy, though (bow shot?). The AOE isn't big, but if you can get two or more people caught in it, it feels like huge value out of the cooldowns you force them to pop.

For tanks, I had most success on DRK, I think, although all the tanks can do the job just fine. Probably due to the healing debuffs he brings, and the reset of his dive makes for quick chasing. TBN makes for extra durability, and his burst is pretty good too, albeit mana restricted."

That being said, I've found that a quick 1v1 is possible against another DPS. Melee usually beats ranged, imo, but BH matters a lot. I try to avoid 1v1 against tanks or healers because it usually takes way too long to kill them by yourself.

As far as just killing goes, try to pressure their healers if possible. Good healers can multitask, but subpar healers will get overwhelmed when trying to save both themselves and teammates."
