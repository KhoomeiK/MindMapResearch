drugtesthelp,fecek5n,t3_enbvkj,1578972042.0,"You could've probably left your body hair alone. It takes around 7 days for the dirty hair to break the skin on your head. Body hair grows slower. If I were you, I'd keep my body hair shaved for the rest of the duration. Just maintain your head hair. They'll most likely just go for that anyway. They say 1/2 inch of hair is 30 days. If you've grown a fresh 1.5 inches by now you should be ok. Maybe trim it down to an exact 1.5 one last time beforehand."
