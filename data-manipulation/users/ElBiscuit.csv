I’ll grant you that all those religions may say those things.  But how do those claims get us any closer to showing that Christianity is the only religion that makes sense?  If your list of qualifications for which religion makes the most sense is “the one where God created us in his own image, God loves us, and the messiah came to Israel”, then yeah, you’re pretty conveniently going to end up with Christianity as the right answer.  But if Christianity didn’t already make those claims, what are the odds that that’s the exact list you’d come up with?
