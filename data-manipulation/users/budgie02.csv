I’m sick of it, and I no longer care. I know I was harsh, I know it was wrong but I am just so done. What is happening is not okay. The only ways anti-vaxxers have ever been made sensible is when something happens to their children. But still, half the time they blame misinformation and not themselves. The truth about that baby is that it should be adopted out to a family that will get vaccinated and cared for. As well as the rest of his infectious 3 other children. I won’t freaking stop until they stop comparing themselves to Jews in the holocaust, take the 9/11 slogan and use it to victimize themselves, and complain and complain and complain.
