bulletjournal,fcqxm7e,t3_eid6pa,1577893752.0,I almost wrote “Happy New Yer” in my journal... thankfully it was in pencil
bulletjournal,fcqws7n,t3_eifonb,1577893401.0,"If I had a bullet journal when my son was a newborn I would have tracked feedings (time, amount, side I fed from, whatever), diapers (when he was a newborn), vitamins (since he was breastfed he needed vitamin d), pumping (time, amount, etc), any meds (time, amount, reason), naps (if you want)... stuff like that

Now that he’s almost 2, I just add anything to my daily. If any of my kids have a fever or other symptoms, I stick it on my daily so I can see how long it’s been going on."
bulletjournal,fcnp26b,t1_fcnotd8,1577815727.0,My first weekly of January starts on Sunday the 29th and ends Saturday the 4th.
bulletjournal,fcno5dp,t3_ei645d,1577815202.0,"I put the week in the month with the most days... so if it has 2 days in January and 5 days in February, the weekly goes in Feb."
bulletjournal,fci8qr4,t3_eha7i7,1577659119.0,"I do my setup for the day the night prior after my kids go to bed. It usually takes me about 10-20 minutes a night. I then leave my journal open on my desk at work throughout the day and add stuff or cross things off as needed. 

I prepare my monthly calendar and weekly spreads during the last week of the month prior so it only adds an extra 10-20 minutes a night. Some months I don’t do anything fancy and just add doodles later. Sometimes, I have more time/motivation and spend more time making it pretty during my set-up week."
BasicBulletJournals,fc3kkpr,t3_edkihr,1577391872.0,"I have a spread to handle all the yearly appointments for my family, since I’m the one that keeps the family calendar... I track appointments like dentist, optometrist, flu shot, physical, hair cuts. That way I can tell when they’re due for each thing. I find it useful to have it all on one spread."
bulletjournal,fbaf90g,t3_ec1cjf,1576676493.0,I love how you used the stickers in your weekly. I didn’t know I was looking for something like this until now!
