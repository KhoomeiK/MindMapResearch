Actually, he didn't hang too long because they were able to revive him shortly after finding him. He stayed until the end of Season 3 I believe before he died.

And you're right. The death of Lady didn't signify the death of Sansa, so the death of Shaggydog doesn't necessarily have to be the death of Rickon. I actually hadn't considered that. Perhaps Shaggydog dying could be used as a reasoning for Rickon becoming important to the plot or something."
freefolk,ffvp4e8,t1_ffvo4x3,1580269433.0,"Yes, but GRRM named the direwolf Shaggydog for a reason. I could totally see this being a storyline that just leads to the same ending as we got in the show (although hopefully a lot more fleshed out than just ""here they are, they're dead now"")."
freefolk,ffvoyg7,t1_ffvjenw,1580269315.0,"From what I can tell, Shaggydog was the most aggressive. Greywind was great in war, but he was seemingly super well trained. So not as aggressive until the time arose that he needed to be."
freefolk,ffvoa6l,t1_ffvllie,1580268840.0,"Symbolism is a huge part of that too. Sansas direwolf represented her desire to be a lady. When lady was killed, so was Sansas innocence and desires.

Aryas and Jon's are pretty straight forward, as you said. Robb's direwolf was kind of representative of  his military personality, I think. Him I'm not entirely sure about.

As for Bran and Rickon, I've already explained Rickon. A Shaggydog story is one the eventually leads nowhere and no little to no relevance to a plot. His Wolf's name not only foreshadowed his eventual death (his life having little meaning more than being a mere pawn used by Ramsey) and the eventual fact that 90% of the show was irrelevant to the overall plot.

With Bran, his wolves name was Summer. Upon her (?) death it marked the end of Summer and the beginning of Winter, as the NK and WW fully began their fight against the living during the attack of the 3ER."
