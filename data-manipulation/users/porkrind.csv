motorcycles,ff0uhhi,t1_feyhnms,1579472403.0,Shit yeah! You can negotiate with your *own* damn insurance company too. Never sign off on a payout offer until you’ve researched the market.
motorcycles,ff0skvq,t1_fez19jr,1579471907.0,"I bought the large sized Motion Pro tire irons that also interlock to become a bead breaker.    Changing a tire with those is pretty easy after the first one where you get the feel for it. Got some plastic rim protectors that slip in and have been able to do the job several times without marking the rims. 

I got a balancer kit from Marc Parnes that sits across a pair of jack stands and can balance a wheel in just a couple of minutes."
motorcycles,ff0r9vh,t1_fezo6ip,1579471558.0,"Came here to say this. My AMA membership with roadside assistance has more than paid for itself over the years. 

And I’ve found that my dealer will come get my bike too. I popped a MAF sensor, making my bike run so poorly that it was unsafe to ride. The owner of the dealership came by with a van a couple days later at no additional charge."

typography,fez0iu5,t3_equi22,1579452758.0,MY GOD! I thought my Intertype was a complicated machine. This is another level beyond. Or two. Or three.
motorcycles,fese13x,t1_feorunr,1579364221.0,Apparently I did! I can’t explain how that happened.
aww,fesdn3r,t3_eqfhyk,1579364114.0,That horse is mostly concerned about the fact that she doesn’t seem to be carrying any treats.
motorcycles,feoljon,t1_fenb153,1579301876.0,"For the most part, when you see articles talking about the death of the 600, they're talking about the Supersport-class race replicas. That's a very specific type of 600cc bike that has faded in popularity, it's not commentary on the 600-700cc market in general.

Ducati,feoka17,t1_feojwv8,1579301377.0,"Someone is going to pay a ton for that baby. Me, if I win the lottery in the next day or two."
aviation,feo30yv,t3_eq3182,1579294469.0,"The old joke ""How do you get an F-104? Buy some land in West Germany and wait."""
motorcycles,felv7cl,t1_feh47wc,1579231753.0,"Happy cake day, grandpa!"
motorcycles,felv6g8,t3_eoyxcd,1579231735.0,"Been riding since '94. I had my first drop in 2012. Was riding while too tired, pulled into my spot in the garage at work and just never put my feet down. Oops. 

Depending on definition,  I dropped a different bike in 2018. I had a flat tire camping at Laguna Seca, and was pushing the bike so I could put in a plug. The grass was still wet with dew and I fell, knocking the bike over."
LosAngeles,fei730z,t3_ep3ni2,1579131739.0,Ah I fucking love Velvia. I used to shoot it occasionally on my 4x5 camera until the last local processor closed up.
motorcycles,fehb2bj,t1_feh6sdl,1579112879.0,Too loose definitely can lead to a jerky drivetrain as the slack is taken up and released.
motorcycles,fegqo34,t1_fegjqr2,1579100265.0,"And in California! Shit, I died *twice* last night while splitting. It's that bad!"
Unity3D,fee9mcs,t1_fee984p,1579029242.0,"Nope, that is the entire text of the relevant law. The law was written with the intent that the CHP could then provide a guideline for safe lane splitting. 

You might remember that the CHP published those guidelines a couple of years ago and some jackass sued them saying they had no legal basis to do so and forced them to retract the document. This law just puts the framework in place for them to legally do what they had tried and failed to do."
motorcycles,fee610y,t1_fecg91e,1579027127.0,"Undo the velcro, open the gauntlet a bit and shoot a couple of pumps of soap into the gap. Run some water down into the glove and redo the velcro tightly. Stand in place, shaking your hands vigorously. Walk out of the bathroom without draining your water balloon hands. Win."
motorcycles,fee5hne,t1_fed7srb,1579026807.0,"Goddamnit. I see videos like this all the time and they really frustrate me. I cannot do this. And by ""this"" I don't mean corner tightly or swerve with agility. I mean that there's no fucking way in hell I'd remember the goddamn course."
motorcycles,fee4pqr,t1_fe88olf,1579026347.0,I can get deep into the ABS and/or lift the rear wheel with two fingers. There's literally no more braking to be had for me.
