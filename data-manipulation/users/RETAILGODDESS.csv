depression,fcmfcbp,t3_ehyfk3,1577773180.0,"Hey there! I am 17 and I know a little about what you’re experiencing. I feel as if life is sometimes just a constant routine that needs to be broken because if it isn’t than things get very boring. When things are boring, life gets depressing and seems pointless. You’ve hit the nail on the head when you said that you must do something different (in order to break this routine). I do not personally know you, but I know your mindset. You just use school and your Xbox to get through the day, because the days do get repetitive. These may provide some comfort or no comfort at all. I would seriously recommend joining a club or sports team at school if you haven’t already, you may also consider volunteering in the community. Late is better than never! These things seem meaningless at first glance because they do end at some point, but they will let you see the beauty of being involved in life. This past summer I would’ve been so bored if I didn’t volunteer at a hospital! I would also recommend setting long term goals, this may entail a career or a big trip you want to take! :) anything that seems special to you somehow, you must dig deep within yourself to find this. You may feel surrounded by people at times, but how much of the social scene or experience at parties are you actually absorbing? You will feel alone if you are absorbing nothing. You will not be happy or excited about anything if you live out your days feeing truly alone. Things will not get better unless you do something that forces and encourages you to interact with other humans and the scene around it, you MUST learn to absorb your surroundings for what they are. In terms of drinking, this is not a healthy way to cope, and based off of the way you worded your comment, I’m sure you realize this. In short, you cannot drink your problems away. Drinking takes the mind off of what’s going on around you, it changes the way the mind perceives emotions by either making them dormant or enhanced. When you feel the urge to drink, go and jog a mile, read something online, volunteer or walk around the neighborhood, maybe cook something! You have the potential to enjoy your life, everyone does! You are not an empty person, you just need to change your perception (without alcohol)! You can do this, I know you can. Just make the most out of small things around you, and don’t over analyze your negative thoughts (especially the ones about yourself). I wish you the best of luck :) though I doubt you’ll need it! If you want to talk feel free to message me anytime!"
depression,fcmdofs,t3_ehyfma,1577771557.0,"Hey there fellow senior! I am in the exact same place as you right now. I have dogs, I go to school, I have a job, I feel the same way, I actually have one art credit to finish next semester before I can graduate. A lot of the things you do and describe are a big part of my day-to-day as well. I completely understand the feeling of wanting to move on and make a change, it is hard because I feel like I am trapped under this cloud of being a child, only I’m not really a child anymore. I am only 17 but the world isn’t so big to me anymore. I think the trouble of the relapse of depression or down thoughts comes with thinking, as you’ve mentioned. I start to think about all of my failures and about what I COULD be doing right now, now that I have the free time to do so. I compare myself to my peers, I am stressed about college already and I haven’t even completed high school. Ugh. I am on break now and it couldn’t be more miserable, I got rejected from my dream school, but got into some halfway decent schools. That isn’t enough to satisfy my conscience though, I will always question everything and anything and of course that entails myself and most aspects of my life. The best thing to do is (and I know it is way harder than it sounds) to just block those negative thoughts and worries. When one is about to come into your view just smack it away and forget about it. These thoughts are natural and usually the result of our anxiety trying to prepare us for potential bad, but most of the time such thoughts are unnecessary. I am burnt out already from my senior year (gotta love AP physics), but we only have one semester left, things will get better when we go off to college, whether that may be one state away or halfway across the planet. We will be free of being adults identified as children, we will then be adults identified as adults. We will have more of a drive to study and work hard (and have some fun in the process) because we will be on our own in a whole new world with new and exciting things that will make high school seem like a kids playground. Just let yourself relax when you are given the chance to, you have accomplished success, you have more than enough resources around you to keep your brain preoccupied with positivity at the moment. Life is NOT actually all that bad, things will turn up, just wait and you’ll see! I would love to hear where you plan to attend college and what you would like to study! I wish you the best of luck (though I doubt you’ll need it)!"
depression,fcmcdhm,t3_ehyfja,1577770356.0,"I am very sorry to hear this. I would imagine that the pain and disappointment you are feeling is unbearable. I have a few questions to ask you first (you can reply here or personally message me). Why did you go to college in the first place? What changed in your attitude in high school versus college? Has there been an occurrence of traumatic or displeasing events since you first started college? Why are you ACTUALLY upset about this? What could happen to help you feel better about your situation? Please answer as soon as you can, we will work through this together and I will help you make this better :)"

depression,fcmazvw,t1_fcm7nnt,1577769149.0,"The electrolyte imbalance that I was referring to was more specifically to people suffering from bulimia nervosa, when a person binge eats then purges. Vomiting can also lead to dehydration and dysregulation of the secretion of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone steroid hormone system which means that renal failure can develop in severe cases. With dehydration, emesis can result which affects the heart. Sinus tachycardia, hypotension, and orthostasis can put the heart and individual at risk of heart failure. These heart problems in this case are the direct result of a person purging, the electrolytes in our bodies are minerals that carry an electric charge, there are certain electrolytes that dissolve in the blood, for example sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate. These act to help regulate nerve and muscle function, and maintain the diffusion of water into these parts of the body, they also help to maintain the acidity and alkalinity of these parts (thus maintaining a proper PH), when there is a deficiency of these one might experience muscle weakness, spasms and paralysis. The weakness and paralysis is what I’m referring to as the main down fall. When muscles are weakened a person feels more of an inability to move them, they then may reduce the frequency of movement and exercise, this is the reason that muscle is lost. Once the heart is weakened it may experience arrhythmia as the abnormal frequency is the body’s natural response to compensate for the lack of nutrients. Sorry this is long but I can explain more if needed :)"
depression,fcleqho,t3_ehmqfh,1577746090.0,"This is not an appropriate comment. There are some people on this subreddit who are depressed because of their weight and this comment encourages starvation and there progression of another potential mental illness or eating disorders. It is not healthy to starve yourself because you can easily degrade muscle first and you can develop permanent and pore fatal heart defects due to prolonged electrolyte imbalance. Please do not comment things like this here. I would understand if this was an awareness post, but to me it just seems like sarcasm poking fun at a more serious issue."

They might mean nothing but they could mean something we don’t know because we ourselves cannot run tests that health care facilities can administer. I truly apologize though because I should have been more reasonable with the wording in my reply. I would probably be saying the same thing you said if I read my response also. Though my wording was not the best, it is still of importance to maintain truth in saying what I said, because most of the time it’s better to be looked at by a professional than not if you feel abnormal, as soon as possible to increase effectiveness of any potential treatment administered."

hypochondria,fcgzhlg,t1_fceb28c,1577645657.0,"I feel this way all the time! I convince myself that I’m dying when I see a random lump or bump. I have a lipoma under my skin and I was convinced that it was liposarcoma even though I know it isn’t because it hasn’t changed for years and I didn’t notice any other cancer-related symptoms. I had an ultrasound done in the fatty tissue and nothing was found, the fat looked uniform throughout no signs of irregularity this no area of concern. But before the ultrasound I couldn’t even sleep, I had convinced myself that I was dying. I even typed up a bucket list, when my mom and sister wanted to convince me to get out of the house and do something, I said “what’s the use? I won’t be here in a year.” (Aka this thing is going to kill me or something else will). When I get myself into this mindset I feel lost, nothing else matters to me except a potential diagnosis that doesn’t exist. It’s a very big hindrance to think this way but anxiety does this to me, and to anybody else suffering from the disorder. You probably do not have cancer or another potentially terminal illness, but you do have hypochondriasis. The best way to relieve the thoughts from it is to remember that you are healthy and that you are just fine. It is not that simple though, you have to picture yourself being healthy and doing things in the future, you have to convince yourself of the things that will actually happen (the positive) because they will, versus the things that won’t ever happen, despite your anxiety telling you it will or it could (the negative). I hope this helps :)"

askdoctors,fc7fngg,t3_eghfz4,1577505996.0,"Hello, I am not a physician yet but I do know a lot about this. You took a good initiative in pushing the cranberry juice. You might also consider drinking at least a gallon of water everyday, this will help to filtrate your kidneys, the main filtration system in the body that converts cellular waste into urine. The more diluted the urine, the less bacteria per milliliter, this means that you will be excreting a LOT of the bad bacteria in your urinary tract. Ask your doctor to take a new urine sample and run the sample to a pathologist, who can identify exactly which type of bacteria is causing the infection. You may have a UTI, but you may not know exactly which type of bacteria is causing it, therefore you may not receive the proper treatment for the infection and it won’t be treated effectively. When you stop showing symptoms of a UTI than it is most likely the case that you have asymptomatic bacteriuria or less virulent bacteria in the urine. I know that this is a lot but consider talking with your doctor about this, but for home remedies here are a couple of suggestions: drink pineapple juice and take probiotics to help effectiveness of treatment. I hope this helped at least somewhat I wish you luck and good health! :)"

It could just be an inflamed lymph node in your groin which is quite common and is usually not cause for concern unless you notice any other symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, loss of appetite or unusual/ongoing pain. Do not be afraid to sleep because of these jerking movements, lack of sleep can cause you to physically be sick. These movements are common as well and do not mean anything serious.

I know the effects these disorders have on my life but I do not use them as an excuse to dwell. Dwelling feels good for a short while until it turns into sadness, which, if coupled with negativity and the unwillingness to change, causes depression, and where does that leave us? Dwelling has NO benefit at all. It is useless. You should not continue to push away other people who try to help you by saying kind words, yes corny and cheesy, but they are kind words.

I am literally only 17 and I know this much about a terrible situation, but I have grown. I have big goals and aspirations and a minimal support team. I am the only one here for myself. I have never received counseling for anything. You must help yourself because you are only YOU. You cannot control what they say or do. Just help yourself by relaxing a bit more. You may find that some things are not as bad as they seem."
Life,fc63wnm,t1_fc5wyoc,1577471694.0,Good! I’m glad this has helped you. Have a better day!
depression,fc63t6g,t1_fc63hcg,1577471633.0,"I had bad anxiety a couple of years ago. People would make fun of me in school and call me “nervous (my name)” I was 15 and a shy teen. I’m 17 now. I have never received counseling for anything. I had to force myself to look into people’s eyes again and look at my surroundings and smile. It sounds hard but that’s because you can’t imagine yourself doing it. Just try it, if I’m wrong than you don’t have to ever try that again. It’s worth a shot!"
depression,fc63irz,t1_fc62qqa,1577471448.0,"I hope this is not sarcasm, but if it really helped you than I’m glad! :)"
depression,fc63f7f,t1_fc61uoo,1577471383.0,That’s great! Have fun and seize the day!
depression,fc63bpe,t1_fc61hki,1577471319.0,"I have already read the description of this subreddit twice. You don’t know my situation either, my dad was stricken down with an illness three years ago and has been suffering very painfully since then. I have witnessed careless people leaving him for dead in his most vulnerable state. I have seen him having seizure after seizure on his death bed. I am only 17 years old I was 14 when this first happened. My life has been a constant struggle. I had such bad social anxiety a couple of years ago that I could barely survive going to school. I have anxiety and OCD which used to rule my life a lot. I have controlled my OCD but my anxiety is bad. I also suffer from hypochondriasis. I have an internal battle as well as an external battle. Life is not easy for me, but I gain strength in helping other people. My dad has had an array of health problems including a stroke, when he had this I seriously contemplated various methods to take my own life. I have never received any counseling for any of this. I have had to pull myself out of depression as it made my other disorders progress. I chose not to live my life in a cloud of anger and sadness. I found relief when I did this. I didn’t want to live that way ever again, I was tired of it! It is no way to live! Life is too short to put yourself through that. It’s just no way to live, that is why people commit suicide, because they don’t want to live in the depression anymore. I get it. I know what it feels like to desire a near end. But you were put onto this planet for a reason, to live. Some people never even get a chance at life. Some people never get to open their eyes and see the world. Oh but they would love to be able to type on reddit if they had the ability. This is why I say to be positive, I’m not berating you, but you just jumped to conclusions before you knew why I truly say these things. My dad is wheelchair bound and is suffering as we speak. It kills me everyday. My sleep used to be effected. But I’m past this now. I’ve experienced things that most adults only see when they’re older. I was forced to grow up and control my inner thoughts, I was forced to find my own strengths and goals. The road is rocky at first but it will smooth itself out if you just change the wheels you use to travel, in other words, change your mindset about your situation and you will find that life really does get easier and better. Sorry this is long, I just wanted to share."
depression,fc61qtu,t3_egehba,1577470304.0,"Hey there! I just wanted to say that I’m glad you decided to share this. I admire the fact that you volunteered and acknowledge the fact that missing it is wrong! I have days like this sometimes, I struggle to get out of bed and when I do my head feels heavy and I am already bored with the day. You are NOT worthless. You are worth more than you will ever know! I guarantee you that you have so much potential! If you don’t mind me asking, what caused you to feel down in the first place? What is the root cause?"
depression,fc6179l,t1_fc608ig,1577469960.0,"Why do you feel this way though? What is the root cause? This stuff is cheesy and boring but part of life is as well. Light is what you make it, it doesn’t mean literal light, it means happiness. There must be something in this world that makes you happy! You have got to STOP dwelling on the bad, you’ll find that the reason you are surrounded with depression is because you dwell. Life WILL NOT get any better or easier if you dwell. And don’t get me wrong, dwelling feels great sometimes, but it should not be the main aspect of your life. Now I don’t know your situation, as many people have their own unique situation, but there is one universal way to handle it, you cope with strength. The strength that I’m talking about is not something that has to be acquired, it is naturally instilled within you. You have that strength and that is why I know that you will be okay. Your life will be okay. Things will turn up if you let them. If you are briefly thinking positive thoughts, let them in and invite them to stay! You seriously must do this to get better. I wasn’t trying to offend anyone on this subreddit by spilling some corny line, I am just here to help! If you ever want to talk, feel free to reach out!"
depression,fc6075x,t1_fc600s7,1577469413.0,"It’s easier than it sounds. Start with small things, then work your way up from there until you reach the big picture. From there hit the ground running!"
depression,fc602uk,t1_fc5z20h,1577469349.0,"I’m sorry you feel this way. Stuff like this doesn’t help me much either, but having that attitude where you shut out any light that tries to enter is why you may feel down all of the time. It’s simple. Try it."
depression,fc5q84w,t1_fc5palh,1577463603.0,I’m glad this helps! :) :) have a better day today!
depression,fc5p1tr,t1_fc5nldb,1577462955.0,But WHAT about your life? When did this happen? And please share how it makes you feel!
depression,fc5nb8t,t3_egckl4,1577461998.0,"Do not be so hard on yourself! You were brought into the world with the purpose to live and be happy. You may feel down at the moment and you may imagine yourself vanished from existence, but that is because your mentality leads you to act and feel this way. Think more positive thoughts :) show yourself that you still have the potential to have conversations with people. You’re still human right? Just look at the small things and make the most out of them. Let good thoughts into your head and invite them to stay! I wish you the most luck, and remember...you are worth WAY more than you will ever know!"
depression,fc5mvbn,t3_egclqu,1577461750.0,Why do you feel this way?
depression,fc4xr48,t3_eg6rgr,1577432972.0,"Hello there! I am sorry to hear this. It makes me sad that you think that you are ugly and an embarrassment. I don’t know you or your partner but I know that if they thought that you were a true embarrassment that they would not want you in their life at all. But obviously they don’t think this and that is why they have you in their life! :) I can tell you something, I know what it’s like to feel as if I’m a burden on someone, it makes me feel worthless and completely drains me of all self esteem and hope. You are a human and so is the rest of the human population, most of the differences between us are minimal, we may look different and act different but we are all mostly built the same. We each have a heart, a soul and a head. How we use these things are the reason why we are truly different. It is not good for you to be taking random medication to punish yourself. I would suggest having a serious heart to heart conversation with your partner, tell them how you feel! One day you may discover that these pills cause you permanent illness and when you are in a good relationship that you enjoy, that will effect you negatively and it will also affect your partner negatively. You care about them and you care about yourself otherwise you wouldn’t be posting this personal stuff on reddit. I know it may be hard to grasp but you are worth more than you know. Stay positive :) Always look toward the sun light because there is a part of you shining in it everyday! You WILL get through this, and things WILL get better! But please, do not take pills anymore that you don’t need because you are YOU and you cannot control what others think/believe about you. If you love yourself than it should NEVER matter what others (yes even your partner) think about you! I wish you the best of luck, and remember, you are worth more than you know!"
