In the last year or so my provider added free SMS in other countries, but everything else abroad is expensive.

It doesnt mean nothing is ever going to happen you at a low risk place. But an art class where she is with her friends, classmates clearly ready to back her up since she recruited them for her 'blockade', and a teacher with experience, it's a fairly safe place to tell someone to back off her friend, assuming he didnt give her reason to believe he'd turn violent. As opposed to places considered high risk, like a dodgy bar you're at alone, or a public park after dark."

My friend and I are currently running a challenge run where we each choose one tool (with the exception of weapons) and can only use that tool and no others. She chose the pickaxe, I chose the fishing pole. Took us till mid fall to start farming since we had no hoe or watering can.

AmItheAsshole,fek2fnp,t1_fejx94c,1579191177.0,"Absolutely. It's best to flat out explain verbally why something he did was inappropriate. He probably doesn't understand why you guys are doing this. I know talking about those things can be awkward or difficult to put into words sometimes, since social cues are something a lot of us never need to vocalize, which is why I can't rule YTA. A lot of people are just uncomfortable around those who dont quite understand as easily as the rest of us, and I get it. But I'm willing to bet if you pull him aside and explain it to him, he'll be grateful for it. Perhaps embarrased, but thankful. I agree, NTA."

They've got years and years of proven child rape and abuse under their belt, hidden away by one of the most powerful organizations in the world where they protect these molesters and pressure victims and their families to say nothing in exchange for compensation. And yet your attitude tells me you very clearly dont know the first thing about any official Satanist group, which hasn't had any such legitimate scandals. Well, other than people like you spreading fearmongering articles and made up stories by pearl clutching suburban moms from the 80s who dont understand what a dungeons and dragons book is. Next time you want to pin abuse on a group for the sake of slandering them, do your research properly."

The few lady friends that I have are almost all in relationships so I'm friends with their SOs as well. So by default I know more men than women and tend to have more in common with them. But none of those relationships are anything close to sexual or romantic. Most of them are married, in a relationship, or much older than me. So the dynamic of our relationship didnt change at all when I got together with my BF. I find, more often than not, emotionally mature guys are more than capable of maintaining platonic friendships with women. Which is nice because they're cool guys"

The Japanese course isnt anything special, I wouldnt use it for anything other than memorizing hiragana and kanji. However, if you dont know the first word of a brand new language, it ain't terrible. Itll give you a good first stepping stone into the language that you can then branch off of and learn from other sources. Plus... it's free, which is huge.

AmItheAsshole,fdkf1wv,t3_elv1jd,1578502500.0,"I hesitate call you an asshole, because it seems like an honest misstep. But yeah, that was fairly inappropriate for a few reasons. First, it seems like he gave no indication that he does nude photography prior to the question, let alone would be comfortable doing such a thing. Secondly, he wasnt there in a professional manner, it was a casual visit. He wasnt there to find clients, making a business arrangement when someone is visiting someone else is a bit rude. And finally, the manner of the relationship between you two. You're a friend of his girlfriend's mom, so he associates you with her. Put yourself in a similar situation, what if one of your parents' friends asked you to see them naked? And everyone knew about it? It definitely feels weird, even if it's in a professional manner.

If being photographed nude is something you're into, do a web search for companies that do that, or inquire through a company email or phone number. I'd steer clear of asking random photographers to take pictures of you naked. Especially ones you dont know very well.

In closing, YTA, but not maliciously. I dont think anyone is going to hold this against you."

Support the politicians who support changes you want by telling them so, donating, and (this one is important) voting. Not just in the big elections, vote locally. These are the people who actually get shit done. And support news sources that focus on facts and real journalism rather than fearmongering or clicks.

The next door neighbors were a super sweet older couple who liked to garden and being outside in the summer a bunch we'd see each other and chat.

But I certainly can't afford to drop $1000 on a transatlantic flight every year, and neither can most Americans.
