Within 50 years all babies will be genetically engineered to have a 0 risk of all genetic diseases like Alzheimers, Cancer, Chronos, etc. That will be standard and maybe eventually required. The rich will engineer their babies to be born with perfect hearts and other organs as well as to design their adult heights, genders (although this can be done now by separating the sperm through a centrifuge since the XX chromosome is heavier because it has an extra arm the XY separates to the top and the XX to the bottom), size of feet and hands, unique colored eyes like purple and pink etc, and most importantly penis size. This sounds like science fiction but the actual science is already very strong (look up CRISPR) the only thing standing in the way are the religious politicians."
