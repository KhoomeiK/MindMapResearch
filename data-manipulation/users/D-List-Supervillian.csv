coolguides,ffz8col,t1_ffy2l4o,1580367154.0,I broke my femur when I was 2 years old from what my parents have told me it sounds like it was an oblique displaced fracture.  The doctor at the time said I was lucky because the way the break lined up  they wouldn't have to do anything other than put a cast on me.  If I remember my parents said he said it was because the bone pieces overlaped which was apparently exactly the way they needed to be so one leg wouldn't grow to be longer than the other.  I spent 6 week in traction and had a cast from my waist down to below my knee I think.  I apparently had to learn to walk again after it was healed.  What ya think is what my parents told me sound right.
coolguides,ffz7gij,t1_ffyyzi5,1580366351.0,I broke mine when I was two years old not sure which type of fracture but I think it was an oblique displaced from what my parents told me about what the doctors told them.

They basically have the food safety standards of the Middle ages.  It is really no surprise that a disease like the coronavirus first started in one of their disgusting wet markets.

trashy,ff7sjnw,t1_ff7okmz,1579657319.0,"He needs to show up with a lawyer to the meeting to discuss how he is going to fuck their world up with lawsuits.  You are absolutely right beyond the credit check what vehicle he drives and what his personal finances look like are none of their damned business.  He needs to make it clear that if they take  any action against him he will sue the fuck out of them and win because he has proof of their B.S.

Edit I know that what they are doing is legal so I guess he should go with my second thought then.  Have a nice polite meeting and then find a way to destroy their careers their families and lastly their health legally of course.  You don't want to know what my third option is muwahahahahaha!
