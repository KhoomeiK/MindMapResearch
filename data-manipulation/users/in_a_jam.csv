For example, if you sell merchandise of your inking oc nintendo could still send you a cease and desist, but if it were simply an inspired character you made and not recognizably an inkling then you hold rights."
AmItheAsshole,ffauxar,t3_eslwvx,1579745068.0,"I'd say this is NAH. You're getting irritated and you can't help it, plus it seems really extreme in your case. Your mom and sister aren't either because they can't understand how uncomfortable it makes you due to them enjoying singing so much. Just a small human moment."
AmItheAsshole,ffauhye,t3_eslye8,1579744783.0,"It was debatable, but ESH. She should have moved her baby and shouldn't have yelled in front of babies. As for you, you should never move a stroller with a child in it."
AmItheAsshole,ffattc5,t3_eslzew,1579744331.0,"YTA, you should probably own up. The height is irrelevant and they'll find out one way or another if it turns out to be yours. Confront the problem to avoid dealing with it later."
