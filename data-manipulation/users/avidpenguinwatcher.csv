FullShrimp,ffyel02,t1_ffye89g,1580344559.0,"You're totally right. Leviticus, and the old testament as a whole say lots of things. Many of those things are very good even by today's standards and absolutely apply to Christians today. Some things, however, this passage included, are part of the old law for the Israelites. It's a very important theological question to ask which parts of the old testament no longer apply because of passages in the new testament. For instance, Acts. 10:9-16 tells of Peter seeing a vision in which it is revealed that all food is good for Christians to eat, that there is no more ""unclean"" food. This passage also has strong parallels to Christians accepting gentiles and no longer seeing them as ""unclean"" either."

Having the 'adult age' be 18 is for the benefit of the individual not the government, it means you can get a job (for some that is enlisting), make financial decisions on your own, or move out of your restricting parents household.
