todayilearned,ffajjul,t3_esh0nv,1579737313.0,I do not have this mutation. I think I have a different one that makes me sleep a lot and be tired anyway. Or maybe that’s just my age catching up with me.
cults,ff8zb3e,t3_es3d1g,1579700779.0,"I see there is a lot of denial on this thread, but that’s normal I guess. People in cults never think they are in cults. I didn’t either until I left after being in for nearly a decade.

My experience with AA is the very reason I belong to this sub and relate to the cult experience."

politics,fezffxc,t1_feya72i,1579456800.0,Right. It’s absurd to claim that the wealthy don’t pay into social security. Of course they do. It’s a terribly regressive tax and should be changed to apply to higher levels of income but there is no benefit to just making things up.

JUSTNOFAMILY,feteot2,t1_feslznw,1579374655.0,"Exactly! I actually think the trip cancellation is a perfect opportunity to set a boundary. OPs mom wants to put her on a guilt trip—instead she can respond with setting her expectations for future behavior! 

OP I’d suggest that you give mom a time out for at least a week and then set the rules. No criticism of your appearance. No demands for media content. No guilt induction. Violations result in more time out. Do it. No backing down. If your mom learns that her behavior will not work she will cut it out, but she will test your resolve first."

It’s just fucking heartbreaking. It’s not the old days when people disagreed about policy. Now people believe things blindly. Both sides are guilty but one more so. 

It’s so depressing and paralyzing. Maybe that was the idea all along."
AmItheAsshole,fec2n22,t3_eo7x5l,1578965766.0,"NTA. It IS unhealthy to eat like your sister and as a major long term survivor of an ED I stop at nothing when I see this sort of thing.

Sad to say but there can be a very small difference between careful and healthy eating and an eating disorder. Insisting on the same exact dinner every night is over that line and you’re a good mom looking out for your daughter when you say so."

AmItheAsshole,fdsuc6n,t3_emw6xl,1578708046.0,"Can’t make a judgment. This is way beyond Reddit’s pay grade, not because it is useless but because there are just too many factors to consider. 

You two need marriage counseling ASAP."

migraine,fdodey3,t3_emchvk,1578603104.0,"Yep, I've had edibles while visiting a state where it's legal and it definitely helps. But I don't like being high, so what helps me even more is Kratom. I have had almost no headaches since I started taking small doses of Kratom and the only side effect, which isn't a bad one, is a mild mood elevation like drinking coffee. It gets bad press but it has changed my life."
AmItheAsshole,fdocdqz,t3_em9u5g,1578602613.0,"I'm an estate attorney. You would be surprised at the variation in people's viewpoints regarding what is fair. There are so many ways of looking at situations.

Regarding your situation, it is very common for married couples with no children to divide up their estates 50/50 with half going to members of the wife' family and the other half going to members of the husband's family. That's basically what you are doing. Less common, but certainly not unusual would be to split things up equally between all of the siblings of both spouses, which is 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in your case. 

I don't see *either* distribution as unfair and you are NTA for deciding to do it the way you did."
AmItheAsshole,fdn8227,t3_em6zmz,1578579803.0,ESH. Obviously the ex is TA for what she did but for future reference the answer to “should I call this person out on Facebook?” is always “no”.

death,fdfplav,t3_el4rmm,1578367162.0,So sorry you witnessed this. What a terrible thing to see. You will likely benefit from talking to a mental health professional about this. No one could be expected to process such an event all alone.
SelfAwarewolves,fdfmobb,t3_ekygzs,1578365241.0,Totally cool with seeing all of it from all of them regardless of party. What’s the big deal?
antiMLM,fdflwoi,t3_el2ahx,1578364740.0,Why do we call small businesses a “hustle”? Makes the whole notion of a small business seem unimportant. Some of us do have legit small businesses!
EstrangedAdultChild,fdf5roh,t3_eky9rb,1578353945.0,"I’m an estate lawyer ... not your lawyer but here is the general rule.

You are not legally obligated to do anything when either parent dies. You don’t need to plan their funeral or pay their debts.

If you are named to receive some of their assets you can refuse them through a disclaimer.

If you are named as executor of their wills you don’t have to accept the job.

My vote is with those who suggest you go on strike. And stay on strike until he is used to carrying his own weight."
relationships,fddqvvd,t1_fddnqre,1578321591.0,"Honestly my second marriage is an even distribution. The only time I have done more than my husband was when he was undergoing cancer treatment. Aside from that time it’s been 14 years of him doing as much or more than I do. Including laundry, cleaning and shopping. He also notices when things need to be done.

Good men are out there....I swear they are!"
relationships,fddqk11,t1_fdcqw93,1578321323.0,"Can confirm. My first marriage ended partly over issues like OP describes. The housework imbalance started the day we got married but I was able to ignore it until we had kids. 

There is just nothing more infuriating than having to be two places at once and your spouse refusing to help because he has to go to the gym. Then walking in and throwing his sweaty clothes and shoes onto the counter for you to deal with. Then telling you that it’s your job to clean because you are a SAHM mom. Yeah but I’m not your servant....

He was shocked when I left him but I guess he learned his lesson. I understand he does laundry for his second wife."

TwoXChromosomes,fdb7zqv,t1_fd9vivy,1578254798.0,As a mom I agree 100%. But this is a criminal matter not a civil one. She should be contacting the prosecutor who is in charge of the case. If she feels comfortable pursuing this.
TwoXChromosomes,fdb75io,t1_fd9vp0b,1578254509.0,"Yes. OP if you feel comfortable you should contact the prosecutor‘s office. You may be able to provide evidence to help convict your rapist.
