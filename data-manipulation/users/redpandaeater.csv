People tend to praise the 80/20 rule of ACA that Al Franken got put in that makes insurers have to use a minimum of 80% of their revenue on health care costs and the remaining 20% for operations and profit.  While you can say great some people have gotten rebates when they haven't properly predicted premium rates, you can also see how it gives insurers absolutely no desire to help cut medical care costs.  The more things cost, the more they can potentially profit."

It's generally a bad thing that leads to massive shortages since you tend to end up with more demand or at best the same as you did before, but with less supply.  At least with spiking the price you can increase the likelihood of someone truly needing something actually being able to get it, though it would cost an arm and a leg."
