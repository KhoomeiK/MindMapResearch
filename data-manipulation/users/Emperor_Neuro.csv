AskMen,ffhim49,t1_fffv5an,1579936916.0,"As a full-blown nerd, the part that always bothered me the most was how nerdy the characters were about EVERYTHING that could be considered nerdy. All those guys were like the peak of the nerd pyramid about all of it. They couldn't have had someone who disliked Star Trek or refused to read comic books, or was into something else like muscle cars, oh no. Then they wouldn't have been ""nerdy.""

Real nerds aren't like that. For instance, I've got probably around 100 board games, but I hate Dungeons and Dragons. I play lots of video games, but I also go hiking, camping, and travel a lot (which is actually where most of my free money goes). My dad is a car nerd who watches mechanic shows all day long on weekends and likes to buy and fix old cars for fun. Another of my friends, who does love D&D, also participates in Crossfit religiously and does like 20 5k's / obstacle runs per year. 

It just felt very flat. There was no character variety and none of them felt like real people."
AskMen,ffhhxgz,t1_ffh3nh0,1579936017.0,"To me, it was not how they handled the ending that was bad, but how they handled the whole season leading into it. They spun their wheels way too hard gearing up for the wedding."
AskMen,ffhhtfh,t1_fffqm0t,1579935874.0,I bounced most of the way through the first season. They took the actual events of the Columbine high school shooting and capitalized on them with no mention of the actual victims or disclaimer or memoriam or anything. It just felt low and trashy to plagiarize a tragedy like that.

ImperialAssaultTMG,ff1qt5d,t3_eqzjot,1579484139.0,"The best way to play the game, i think, is to go through the campaign head to head with a real player. The app is nice, bit there's nothing like matching wits with another player. There's a lot less of the ""dirty tricks"" in Imperial Assault than you'll see in Descent and it makes the experience much more rewarding. The Imperial player never feels like they're being a jerk just because they have to be one by releasing poisonous gas or other peril effects. 

That said, it's still fun on the app. The app uses its own missions and campaigns and has no crossover with the boxed missions."
AccidentalRenaissance,ff1orn9,t1_ff1jwub,1579482831.0,"There are a lot of people who are of Korean and Chinese descent whose families moved to Japan 100 years ago when those regions of China and Japan were literally Japanese territory and even though their families have lived there for generations, they still don't have citizenship and are still treated like outsiders."
wholesomememes,ff1o111,t1_ff1d5cj,1579482383.0,"I get that. My parents always shush me when I'm talking. I'm in my thirties and they've done it for years. I don't talk any louder than any of the rest of them, and my sister is a good deal louder than I am. I know because I've measured it with a decibel meter. Yet they still shush me all the time when I'm speaking. It just makes me not want to talk at all."
changemyview,fevhd1l,t3_eqjubj,1579397458.0,"One thing that people gloss over in America is that we have a right to NOT vote. That is very important for a democracy to function properly. Countries with mandatory votes are almost entirely dictatorships, whether de jure or de facto. In almost all of those cases, they use the threat of imprisonment and violence to force people to vote for the party in power and any contrary votes also tend to bring around severe consequences for those people. 

The thing is, people should not have to choose the lesser of two evils. If there are no candidates which a person likes, they should not feel the need to compromise their values to endorse whoever they dislike the least. Those who are abstaining from voting aren't likely to be the people to vote straight down party lines without any research, either, which I would argue is a more severe failing of civic duty. Here in America, we have the ability to say that we do not like any candidate, refuse to vote for them, and then still criticize them once they are in office. 

If that same logic were applied to a wider spectrum, you'd wind up with arguments like ""if you don't work in the oil industry, you shouldn't talk about climate change"" or ""women aren't allowed to have a say about going to war since they aren't registered for the draft."" There are a lot of things that people are able to speak about, regardless of their position, whether they were an active participant in creating that situation or not. 

Inversely, should those who did not vote be banned from praising politicians for their good work?"

You're actively discouraged from fighting against enemies because your good weapons need to be saved up, no side activity has any real reward since the only items that matter are either handed to you right at the start of the game or found in shrines.

Bring on the downvotes, but I personally think it's only an average game at best. If you're a big fan of older Zelda games and their memorable characters, unique dungeons, diverse enemies, and good stories, you won't find those elements in BotW. If you want an open world RPG like Skyrim or the Witcher, you won't find that, either. BotW chose to straddle too many approaches to its design and felt weak in its lost focus."
NintendoSwitch,fcpmoza,t1_fcobsy1,1577867633.0,"Get Smash. It's the much better of the two games. MK8 has a decent amount of content for an arcade racer, but it doesn't go beyond the most basic modes or expectations. If you simply want to finish each cup race one time each, then it's only about 4-6 hours of content and then it's just trying to beat your record times. Smash has multiple modes to play through, and even just finishing the basic arcade mode will keep you busy for a very long time because there's like 75 characters on the roster."

Honestly, 7-11 there has better sushi than many restaurants in the US (though Japanese 7-11's are a glorious tier above every concept of a convenience store in the states to begin with). The Japanese whole-heartedly believe in doing everything to the best of their ability, and that shows an effect in the fishermen, the fishmongers, and the chefs. Everyone in the supply chain is striving for excellence, and that's anywhere you go. Meanwhile in the US, many places just go with ""good enough."""

NintendoSwitch,fcppijx,t1_fcp9kma,1577869341.0,"Nintendo is also one of the very few that has had a large share of the console market to sustain them through that. Sega and Atari bungled their console lines and it cost them dearly, but they are still around as developers. 

Other big, long-time developers that i can think of off the top of my head: Squaresoft (merged with Enix and is now Square Enix), Capcom, Namco, Activision, Electronic Arts, From Software,  Koei, Ubisoft, and Rare."
NintendoSwitch,fcpngay,t1_fcoz8q2,1577868093.0,"They announced last year that Metroid Prime 4 is in development for the Switch, but there's no more details about it than that. Could be another 3 or 4 years until it releases for all we know."
NintendoSwitch,fcpn9eu,t1_fcohosr,1577867976.0,"As with anything, there's some big differences in opinion on Breath of the Wild. Bring on the downvotes, but I personally think it's only an average game at best. If you're a big fan of older Zelda games and their memorable characters, unique dungeons, diverse enemies, and good stories, you won't find those elements in BotW. If you want an open world RPG like Skyrim or the Witcher, you won't find that, either. BotW chose to straddle too many approaches to its design and felt weak in its lost focus."
NintendoSwitch,fcpmoza,t1_fcobsy1,1577867633.0,"Get Smash. It's the much better of the two games. MK8 has a decent amount of content for an arcade racer, but it doesn't go beyond the most basic modes or expectations. If you simply want to finish each cup race one time each, then it's only about 4-6 hours of content and then it's just trying to beat your record times. Smash has multiple modes to play through, and even just finishing the basic arcade mode will keep you busy for a very long time because there's like 75 characters on the roster."

AskReddit,fcjikkm,t1_fci7yvq,1577688967.0,"I'm lucky enough to have a job where I get to eat for free at work. I was describing this as one of my work benefits and he scoffed at the concept as the cafeteria food wouldn't be up to his standards. I'll admit that some days it isn't the best or they don't make dishes that I like, but we always have cereal, cup noodles, bananas, bagels, and a salad bar available to us, too so at least there's a backup. Due to the timing of my shift, I get two meals a day there. If I ate out for every meal, that's saving me from $10-20 each day, or up to $400 per month."
movies,fcjgpfj,t1_fcgubx6,1577686955.0,"I fly a lot because of my work. Just two weeks ago I did a roundtrip from Denver, CO to Melbourne, Australia. That's 18 hours each way. I think I watched 10 or 11 movies on my flights. Most of them were pretty new, too, as the airlines want their in-flight options to be exciting for people on such long haul flights."
funny,fc40ns5,t1_fc405ql,1577403529.0,"Ooh. That sounds great. I normally put rice wine vinegar into the water under my steamer baskets so that it cooks into the breading, but I may try that way now."
funny,fc3z648,t1_fc3tskl,1577402414.0,"You'd be surprised. Part of it is the fresh fish, but I think the more significant factor is how fierce the competition and high the standards are in Japan. Honestly, 7-11 there has better sushi than many restaurants in the US (though Japanese 7-11's are a glorious tier above every concept of a convenience store in the states to begin with). The Japanese whole-heartedly believe in doing everything to the best of their ability, and that shows an effect in the fishermen, the fishmongers, and the chefs. Everyone in the supply chain is striving for excellence, and that's anywhere you go. Meanwhile in the US, many places just go with ""good enough."""
funny,fc3yn7f,t1_fc3qiuk,1577402016.0,I like to mix sweet soy sauce with chili oil and use that as a dip for dumplings. The sweet / spicy / fatty combo of that is awesome.
funny,fc3xyvq,t1_fc3o570,1577401512.0,There's a lot of variance in soy sauce. Go to an Asian grocery and you'll see a whole spectrum. I really love the soy sauce that's fermented with mushrooms for that extra punch of funk that's great as a marinade or sauce base.
Boardgamedeals,fbxfx8w,t1_fbx784p,1577185372.0,"If you enjoyed Ascension, you should give Star Realms a try. They have a similar deck building premise, but Star Realms is much more head to head and the choices feel more meaningful."
