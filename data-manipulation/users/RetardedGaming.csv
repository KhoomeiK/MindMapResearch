 My older sisters by 3 years decided to partake, at that time my parents were kinda in conflict about leaving the church so they decided, after I partook in the confirmation ceremony they would leave, as an 11 year old I didn't even know what they meant, they didn't consider whatever I was spouting for that reason. 

Boring story short, I became 13 and was suddenly far more smarter about life so much so that I was able to decide my religion in proper consideration of the impact, my parents refused since that would mean the money they've been paying in was kinda useless, ""At least you'll have a proper marriage this way"" (they don't think a marriage is ""proper"" unless done by the church).
