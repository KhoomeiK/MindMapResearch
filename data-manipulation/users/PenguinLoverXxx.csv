If you're unable to do that then just do some homework, if you don't have anything to do then find something related to do. Just as long you keep yourself busy when these urges come then you are probably going to be fine. Just don't be on your computer or your phone when it does come."

NoFap,fdgdfom,t3_el7mq1,1578391483.0,"If you have used it once, then yes it will feel like you have relapsed. This feeling will stay for about one week, maybe more. Cocaine is easily addictive and you will feel like craving for more the next day, like having a extreme headache. I'm not a expert at cocaine usage but I do have some knowledge about heroin usage at least. Don't worry that you have damaged yourself much, usage over some period of time will cause noticable damage. Just stop using cocaine please."
