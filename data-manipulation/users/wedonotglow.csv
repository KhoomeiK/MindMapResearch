So you move the girl with the darker complexion out of the glare of the sun, maybe in the middle of the other girls or on the right side. Reposition yourself so the buildings in the background aren't visible and BAM your career isnt ruined and neither is this poor girl's self esteem."

politics,fegse0r,t1_fegpc6q,1579101437.0,"Yes I know. Bernie is my candidate and has been since 2016. Doesnt take away from the fact that the DNC is gonna do everything in their power to get Biden the nomination. Once the first big endorsement comes, and the Super Delegates get to talking, it's just a steam roll for the establishment candidate.

When I say DNC I dont mean the *democratic voters* I mean the actual heads of the party that make decisions *for* their voters instead of the other way around."
politics,fegm0r0,t1_fegkzy6,1579096870.0,"When we let a Republican stay in office, the DNC is ""forced"" to push a moderate candidate to garner the right-leaning moderate vote. The DNC could very well win with a progressive candidate but they think they know best and think a more moderate candidate will win. 

I agree that the DNC rigs the fuck out of their races and picks the establishment over the people. But choosing neither party is a vote in the wrong bucket."
