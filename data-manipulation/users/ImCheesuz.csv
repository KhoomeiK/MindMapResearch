memes,fefuz8a,t1_feeqp98,1579066050.0,"Do you even have brain cells? This cycle won't end if you eat meat, animals will suffer and keep suffering because you support the people who kill them."
memes,feeicoo,t1_feehwpj,1579034347.0,It's not about liking it. You are literally responsible for animals being killed. That's not a choice.
memes,feeetwd,t1_feeea2u,1579032293.0,That's a totally different thing because nothing is harmed for these produces. Well not nothing that's true but why would you support something you can so easily just stop doing
memes,feedqu3,t1_feeco1l,1579031656.0,Aha and would you kill them yourself? If your answer is yes aha congratz you are a real man who is not stopping at harming others for his own pleasure. If no why still eat it? They are killed for you and everyone else who decides to eat meat.
memes,feedl2m,t1_feeco6q,1579031560.0,"Thing is that they do get hurt. Take for example milk, mother gets baby cow, baby cow gets taken away gets food produced by humans not milk from mother but mother has milk we take milk. They are hurt. And with milk gone, that's cheese, butter etc that falls away. Now if you eat an egg from friends who have like 6 hens idc if you do tbh. I myself find it disgusting but that is nothing but my opinion. Eating meat and other animal products one buys at the supermarket equals harmed animals. And that's no opinion look up whatever animal product you want and research how humans made a mass industry out of it. If you don't feel disgust then idk anymore"
memes,feeajzr,t1_feeaduo,1579029789.0,Also they will be killed anyways then sooner or later that's what they are there for. We can only stop that if we stop supporting this industry.
memes,feeah82,t1_feeaduo,1579029743.0,Look at comment
memes,feea59f,t1_fee37kz,1579029550.0,Bullshit dude we only have so much animals because we made a mass industry out of living beings. Don't turn it around saying going vegan would cause more animals to die because if you wouldn't eat meat in the first place we would not have this problem now

SuicideWatch,fdbzk52,t1_fd8xypo,1578264328.0,"I agree with you with your point of it goes against the desire of human kind to die. That's why it is an illness. And not all diseases are curable. I don't think it is ""bad"" to commit suicide. People who do it were in horrible pain for too long. The disease tells you not to get help. That's why it is kind of worse than physical injuries. You get your arm broken your instinct tells you go see a doctor. You get depression your mind tells you kill yourself. You have to fight against yourself to fight the disease."
SuicideWatch,fdbwlyo,t3_ekcts3,1578262987.0,"I think so too, it is disrespectful. People are on the edge here. If you don't have anything else to say, don't say anything. Better than empty promises."

buildapc,fd9qpad,t1_fd9po2v,1578236812.0,For price/performance I'd say air cooling is still better but aio looks cool and got a little heads up to air cooling but if you have solid air cooling it is not anything like 10°C. So nothing ground breaking
