I support part of the MGTOW ideology but this is just pure bitter woman hating for the sake of it. A punching bag thread.

I get most of you guys are hurt. But that toxic redirection only works in this hivemind forum. I thought MGTOW was about being above and beyond (I still do) not about being a bitter misogynistic loser.

This thread has no doubt shown MGTOW has gone the way of 2nd or 3rd way feminism. 
(I don’t know the difference anymore but it’s clear it’s same path, same thinking, same mentality, reverse gender but same outrage).

Just be a better person man. Fuck. Just because you hate females it doesn’t mean you’re doing MGTOW right. If anything you’re doing it wrong. It’s known that there’s a tendency for people to hate what they don’t understand.

Y’all not understanding, just hating. That isn’t growth, that’s regression. This is the kind of shit that makes MGTOW look like an embarrassing small dog loud bark complex."
AskReddit,ffcuij8,t3_esps5n,1579807527.0,"Being the average Redditor who can’t hold a legitimate discussion because they’ve been conditioned to write upvote seeking sentences that hold high agreeableness that lack genuine honesty / passion to what they really believe in for fear of disapproval from an audience who could not give two shits about them really.

Taking this one step further, they carry the seeds of this mentality into real life and are faking themselves to please a society that does not give a shit about them, then anxiety and depression follows because they can’t cope with the reality."

madlads,ffcharq,t1_ffcc8w3,1579799448.0,"You’re not all wrong but the Reddit Hive have deemed you unworthy to contribute your opinion. 

I can relate with what you’re saying about the board time as someone who travels regularly on international flights as well, as opposed to meme posting all day and not knowing real life shit. Hell you could even miss your group entirely and just jump on after they called all boarding groups. Not a big deal.

Also understanding twitter culture, you’re not completely off, as twitter avatars are definitely places where selfies are the norm and if you deviate from that you’re most likely a meme / business account / low confidence/ illustrator. Because Twitter profile pics are an opportunity to flex creativity with irl face identity like FB but without the likes. So guess they didn’t want themselves shown. Despite posting personal experiences on the site. (Strong Reddit vibes)

But still a bit of a leap with your last point but I understand the thought process.

But obviously because you’re not conforming with Hive mind thinking here, it doesn’t matter what you bring to the discussion because it’s not what the Reddit zombies want to see. It’s all about appealing to an audience here. I’m not doing that either, guess me and you both are free from trying to create highly agreeable statements that are purely intended for upvotes.

And that’s something I can respect about your comment at the very least. On some level you knew you’d get shit from it but you posted it anyways."

Now he can get away with editing and backtracking his statements. (Which he has now done, expected of course)

We have something far far better though. The actual life skills to identify that his intent was BS straightaway. That’s a much much harder and useful skill to have in life than some internet points.

Reddit hivemind culture wins again though. But to be fair he did get away with manipulating thousands, so I guess that’s a useful skill to have too."
unpopularopinion,ffaeajt,t1_ffabtij,1579733600.0,"I’m not saying every complaint requires therapy or that all ingrates suffer from clinical depression. Just because I said this particular case may do, you made the leap that I’m saying they all do. Another general agreeable statement that you made up, that I didn’t. Why?

Because it generates a highly agreeable comment, that is upvote seeking, not knowledge seeking.

‘All ingrates’? Wtf is that supposed to mean?
Well it clearly means you have a bias against the wealthy.

No one. No one but you. No one is saying the problem requires more attention than another problem. Another deflection is being made here.

The topic here and the key point you continually fail to understand and address, is about the act of a deflective comment and the mentality that drives a deflective comment and how deflective comments do not, by nature of the term itself, address the issue directly.

You’re reaching here, desperately and I can’t entertain this kind of wilful ignorance about understanding what a deflective comment means because you’re not trying to understand.

Again, you’re just trying to generate general statements (ones I’m not even saying at this point) that look largely agreeable so you can win an audience over. 

It’s not about understanding that deflective comments are unhealthy responses to those who perceive they have an issue (no matter how big or small, entitled or not, rude or not)

The problem is, you’re not actually disagreeing with me, you’re disagreeing with a statement you made yourself that you labelled as mine.

To actually legitimately disagree with me, you actually have to legitimately understand what I’m saying. So you can identify what you are disagreeing with. You haven’t even done the basic foundational start, of identifying it.

This is a problem with you, not me. But it’s becoming mine because I’m actually engaging in this nonsense. That has Reddit dopermine upvote response ticked all over.

Its the typical Reddit style of thinking. Which will be more and more obvious as the years go by with more endgame Reddit users who style themselves this way."

unpopularopinion,ffa915g,t1_ffa6e3r,1579730240.0,"It’s a deflection because they’re not addressing the issue just pushing their agenda.

Yes people make far less, and the person should be grateful.

But the point is that they couldn’t invest in that second summer home (their personal target) so they equate that with personal failure and in turn they think their life sucks. 

That’s a problem they have that needs to be addressed directly not through a comparison of the grass is less greener on the other side. 

They might need a clinical therapist to identify the root of their consumption or they might not, and that high achiever mentality drives them to do better and contributes to why they have a high paying job. They might need a financial professional to help them finance towards their goals correctly.

It has nothing to do with other people having far less. That is a deflective guilt tripping response reserved generally for manipulative people.

You took a response. Misunderstood it completely. Then literally copy pasted applied it in a situation where no-one would gain sympathy for the rich, (a reverse sympathy context) in order to manipulate emotional anger for rich people to generate an extremely agreeable response, without trying to actually identify what a deflective comment means.

This is a prime example of what I mean when I say upvote seeking comments try to invalidate the original response by deflecting the main point by generating an extremely agreeable comment and it being a shitty thing to do.

Because you’re not trying to understand, you’re trying to look correct purely for upvotes by matching it to agreeableness.

You are in every way an end game Redditor with the most typical of response."
unpopularopinion,ff96sbn,t1_ff909o4,1579706181.0,"It’s a deflection from the current issue to ignore the original statement that has the intention to  invalidate the original statement as being less.

That deflection in many ways is an act of subtle acceptance that bad is ok.

Redditors are notorious for applying this thought process when upvote seeking.

Instead of actually trying to engage with the original statement they ignore it and deflect it with an extremely agreeable statement that attempts to invalidate the original comment without actually engaging the original comment.

It’s a real shitty thing that is very common use on this site that people fail to identify despite its common use."
unpopularopinion,ff900lu,t1_ff8zar5,1579701341.0,"So you really believe fat shaming people at the gym is a popular opinion.

I don’t know what world you live in IRL but it’s a toxic one.

Yeah it’s good to be self-aware I agree. When at the gym you can’t help but notice what others are doing. 

The key distinction I’m making is that I don’t judge them for what they’re doing. 

If they do a few reps every 15 mins (Christ I’m not even checking how many reps they do every 15 mins but still) if they do that, then fair play. No judgement there I don’t look less on them or more. They may have a reason such as injury whatever. They still did more reps than someone who never even went to the gym that day. Everyone works at a different pace.

Same with photos, as long as they aren’t taking photos of other people, they’re fully within their rights to take selfies at the gym if they want. I’m not one to moderate behaviour at gym / public places unless it imposes on others, which it isn’t. 

I’m not saying people watching at the gym is something we should avoid, it’s good to be self aware but what I’m saying is that making a complete end judgement on what someone did in the few moments you were clearly actively monitoring them, says more about you than it does about them. It’s not even about the fat people thing at all, it’s the how you treat / see people thing.

And I don’t agree with your end observations at all and the way you laid out your post pretending like it wasn’t anything but upvote seeking."
unpopularopinion,ff8yjuz,t3_esajvh,1579700166.0,"How do you know people haven’t physically exerted themselves or a consistently taking pictures and if so how does that affect you? 

How about just mind your business and let people do what they want because they too paid for their gym subs. They could be on a rest day (low strain / weight) or are keeping their socials active by sharing pics of their day with family and friends etc. 

This is an extremely popular virtue seeking post that prides itself in monitoring other people’s activities.

Someone could equally make a post saying I dislike people who go to the gym to watch how others are doing at the gym and then judging them on it depending on outcome.

Fat-shaming in the gym IS the unpopular opinion here on reddit. Not the other way round. Let’s not pretend we don’t know that. 

This is in every way in intent a karma whoring post and of course it’s agreeable in statement but I disagree in intent.

halo,ff8wmzh,t1_ff8r3d0,1579698519.0,"It’s a much different aesthetic though.

H2A kept the visuals faithful with a modernised version of Bungie’s own art style. They did not sacrifice quality and they did not take shortcuts. The biggest artistic liberty being in how they represented gravemind, but still visually closer to a Bungie style than 343i.

Not even 343i could achieve that in any of their artworks sadly. (They’re trying with Halo Infinite but we’ll see) HW2 is more a visual successor of Ensemble studios Blur style mixed with 343i H5’s own touch. A compromised hybrid that worked purely because they kept elements faithful to the first halo wars. But it was always a departure from Bungie’s style.

Two completely different things.

I’d argue that H2A blur cutscenes were the best thing to happen to the Halo franchise in this entire decade with the exception of bringing the MCC to PC. (Thanks in large part to Halo Online’s popularity)

They are more than capable of being responsible for cutscenes, I wish they did Halo:CE’s as well. They would do it right and proper. A key distinction from other productions that half ass things."

“They don’t... bite” - meaning he wasn’t referring to fire ants. 

So bringing it up as a question to him means you weren’t paying attention and are seeking to undermine / detract from his message by bringing up the non-harmless ones, which would be fine as a separate point.

I also agree with your very agreeable statement too. Fire ants. Deffo no no.

But I disagree with the intent because you basically ignored what he wrote so you could write something that was intended more for upvotes than for engaging with his discussion of leaving non-aggressive/non- biting ants alone and now it’s twisted and corrupted his initial message and the discussion has railroaded meaning his point will never get addressed or agreed with in numbers that support yours.

Obviously the end execution is bad and that reasoning is twisted. But kids aren’t inherently evil like that in the UK environment at least.

It’s UK casual type funny because they ran away like little shits in the end, meaning they don’t think they’re hard. They know they’re gonna get their ass kicked if caught. If you were raised round British asbo culture that POS mindset is part of British culture and identity for the working class.

Americans won’t understand it, maybe rough neighbourhood Boston boys or Italian NYC kids like in the movies would get it. 

The whole point is to create trouble and get away with it as a squad. It’s a form of team building but the problem / fun is that it’s negative outcome. Like the orient express mystery. Everyone is complicit. Everyone must  stick together then.

Obviously when you grow up it’s disgusting behaviour but as kids, it’s character building. It’s not the same as kids throwing rocks from a bridge highway like they do in America. There’s a level to this that is ‘madlad’ and not ‘psycholad’ and judging by how they actually put hard  physical work into this, as opposed to just smashing the windows etc, they went with a more creative approach and applied themselves going the extra mile to really be little shits.

Obviously I don’t support the property damage but I would have cracked up too seeing those kids using teamwork / making stories about their delinquent youth.

If anything when these kids grow up they will most likely be far more entertaining and life lived than the average teen (110% true when contrasted with the minecraft in door self-prison childhood playing Redditor) and the problem with that is that they are exposed to so much vices by then growing up with stability and responsibilities is harder to be straight edge so they become failures in the system.

This will no doubt be a unpopular opinion because mainstream society doesn’t understand it, but will gladly consume and fund entertainment that encourages this behaviour in  movies and social media. (Mad lad style activities).

Trainspotting, Skins, This is England. That’s the kind of mindset of youth growth that still exist and won’t change from a cultural POV. Nothing Great about Britain.

It’s really divisive image because its about standards, empathy, compassion and possibly manipulation. 

The innocent takeaway from this suggest that the man in question is a victim of his own emotional experience in this tragedy, and was ill advised because of his own trauma to post this. This would be a more genuine stance from the camp that believes in the goodness of people. Who has a belief that this was not intended in anything but good faith even if the end result is in poor taste.

The other perspective is to do with self-respect and strength of character. That this person does not have either because they ultimately failed in both departments by not only disrespecting their spouse by posting this picture [with or without permission] but in turn themselves because they lack the awareness of the aspect of Reddit / Social Media that gravitates specifically for virtue signalling. The idea that this person is taking comfort in false praise [even if genuine] And short term positive gratification through a numeric figure suggesting popularity means that the person struggles with having a strong sense of strength of character.

The question now is, do we blame this on the situation that the tragedy brought upon for the two victims. Or do we do a meta-analysis and look at the reactions that support this that show lack of concern / understanding of it being seen as a faux pas. It’s a very touchy topic and extremely sensitive.

Because if you believe this guy is doing it for the upvotes (I personally do too) then you lose faith in human beings in a social media age. The idea that the short term doparmine hits are more important to an individual then a long standing respect for dignity and privacy. Means that this guy is truly lost. Which fits in completely with how some people deal with trauma differently.

I can’t really judge in this situation because I can’t relate at that level and I wish no one had to really, but I don’t support it or at the very least endorse it. 

Post like these on social media sites if they were to appear, at the very least should remove the upvote and award mechanism And be strictly comment based only, to remove the social karma popularity aspect. This part I don’t blame him for. 

Reddit and Social media was definitely not designed for this.

This is definitely an example for a need for moderation on social media sites. I’m all for freedom of the net and that but when it comes to sensitive matters, regulation / moderation is important if not just for reinforcing positive behaviour but also identify negative behaviour. As without a doubt, regardless of motive and emotional trauma, this was done in poor taste. That bit at the very least should be identified."

There’s around 5 girls so far, they all mainly just cruise (3 long boarders 2 skateboarders) and hit up the long beach boardwalk to skate cruise on nights where they just wanna chill and get away from it all.

Don’t want to give away too much personal detail but they’re a mix from 19-25 and are mostly all vegans haha they even gave me a bottle of Kombucha and we smoked some weed by the beach. In short they’re awesome people.

halo,fd24465,t3_ejqbfk,1578141378.0,"I always preferred the Reach metal looking plate marines from the original Halo:CE games.

It gave it a more unique spin on how the Halo universe functioned and made it to me out like their armour specifically was a response to Covenant weaponry.

When H2 came round and we saw marines there I always saw it as a more ‘peace core’ everyman role. 

That we were running out of higher quality soldiers and equipment in a war, that starved humanity resources and we were clutching at straws for humanity’s survival from an extinction onslaught campaign. It wasn’t a war at the point post Reach, but a last resort humanity survival event.

Which made seeing an ODST body for the first time in H2 even more badass. Because you knew there were elite soldiers still about but they were just few and far between, scattered as their numbers dwindled down, hunted almost. 

Also knowing that ODST equipment were far more specialised than the ‘Everyman last resort bog standard earth core’ marine, more care and resources were placed on them meaning they had higher priority missions.

By having ODST put on such a high pedestal, that differed from Marines makes you realise just how truly insane SPARTAN-II’s were seen as by the military ranks. If ODST’s were top tier hopefuls for humanity what would MC inspire?

You’re this son of a bitch freak of nature whose entire existence is to fuck shit up and is given the finest training, resources and armour humanity has to offer. You represent humanity’s last resort  at its greatest peak in their most dire time of need.

Any human soldier who has given up on the war/survival effort would want to help you succeed because your success directly correlates with humanity’s survival. 

Humanity was losing at these points, they were losing hard. It wasn’t a Universe where Humanity saw itself as a winner of anything, but a survivor. Merely to survive was winning at this point and even then they were losing at that.

This vibe really got taken away by Bungie as time went on, they somehow forget the sheer desperation and ‘alien’ movie inspired sci-fi aesthetics, and fell more in line with modernised current day reality. The safer and easier option. They still dropped hints of it, but visually it meshed into a more modern day military shooter with sci-fi elements as opposed to being a Sci-fi shooter with military elements.

343i then took this to new heights with no understanding whatsoever to Halo:CE initial style and the thought process and representation behind it. They put Halo 3 on steroids and modded the crap out of everything like there was unlimited asset budgeting and made awareness to military vibes solely in the form of US army style Hollywood banter to relate with modern day players.

That vibe was not lost on me and is a sole reason why Halo lost itself visually, thematically and later itself all together."
