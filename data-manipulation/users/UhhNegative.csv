discgolf,ffqkxuf,t3_euombt,1580137393.0,"In my opinion, from a purely open field regular golf line distances these are the general distance ranges for a good AM1 up to 1000 rated pros. Obviously there will be people who can push things further, but these are the general distances you will see people throwing on Youtube coverage. It gets a little iffy with the drivers because you're often choosing fairway vs driver based more on shot shape, wind, downhill/uphill, etc and not really purely distance.

It won't happen without a good weight shift, and most beginners will have both heels on the ground at the same time (not a good weight shift) and their leg won't look like this during the throw because they are keeping weight on the rear leg too long."

If you walk up a hill 100 feet there is a bottom bound to how much energy it takes to do so. That's generated by your muscles. But it's also state dependent meaning it could take more energy depending on the path you take."
askscience,fenqnct,t1_femjkqj,1579289389.0,"Well of course. A series of enzymes are used to do it in the body. Enzymes typically lower activation energy sometimes the reaction can occur without much energy input. And it's obviously more than one step needed to go from a branched chain fatty acid to CO2 and water (however it's balanced).

With combustion, you are supplying all the input energy that is needed for the reaction in the form of heat. And typically there is nothing governing the rate of reaction in that case except for the level of oxygen in the air. No enzymes needed."

pcmasterrace,feki8en,t1_fekd2l1,1579200587.0,"Because then you are limited by the heat transfer rate from the CPU to the spreader. With this setup the heat is dissipated primarily by a phase change. Depending on the solution and the particular phase change, a phase change will either use up energy or give off energy. So in this case the 3M Novec is being heated by the CPU up to boiling temp. Heating up to boiling is taking some heat from the CPU, but the real heat sink is the latent heat needed for 3M Novec to go into gas phase. As the gas boils off, more 3M Novec takes its place and the cycle continues.

I think you have a point though. If motherboards/CPUs were designed with this type of cooling in mind, I'm sure it would be a different form factor with more surface area. But you would need an all-metal surface and not rely on thermal paste or anything less than amazingly conductive.

Then you run the risk of getting choked for power. Even a lot of modern rigs aren't pulling 300 watts at peak usage and definitely running a lot lower during anything less than peak usage. Something like a 1060 ti will only draw \~120 watts at peak output. Even the 2080ti only consumes 350 watts at peak output but hovers more around 280 during typical gaming.
