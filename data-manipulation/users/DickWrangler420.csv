“Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual ... I now understand how she sincerely feels that she did not consent.”

This quote here basically is him saying that he did it, but without admitting legal guilt. It doesn't matter what he thinks. She clearly didn't consent and that is rape. In those articles, it shows that she was discredited because he put pressure on her and her family when she came into the spotlight."

HydroHomies,ffr16od,t1_ffqdckp,1580148198.0,"No??? He was definitely a rapist. There was clear evidence of a woman entering his hotel room then leaving beaten. She immediately accused him of rape.

He even admitted that he didn't behave well, which is basically saying yes, he did it, without saying he's guilty.

Discharge comes with an open pyometra. I'm not saying that's for sure what your dog has, but that's probably why they ruled it out. An x-ray wouldn't tell you if it was open or closed.

The doctor may have decided to not talk to you about spaying and x-rays because of your body language. After talking about all the medications you'd have to pay for, perhaps they didn't want to push you to spend more?"
