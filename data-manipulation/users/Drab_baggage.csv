desmoines,ffomdx7,t1_fflkkif,1580079130.0,"Lol. I mean, I get the point of why they require it for teenagers and I think it’s a good practice in theory. When I was a teenager I didn’t have the discipline to study the manual, nor did I have a strong sense of self-preservation. I feel like a lot of what teenagers have to learn is why not to do reckless things in a car."
todayilearned,ffn2z1a,t1_ffmf0tk,1580061467.0,"I think it just takes longer for me to settle in at home than at work. As in, I try to make sure everything's just right before I get down to business, and I can spend the first hour or so being like, ""oh I need some tea,"" ""I should take the trash out,"" ""It's sunnier in the kitchen, I'll work there"".

But then when I actually do get started I'm fully cued in and focused on the task, and I stay that way until dinner rolls around. At work I'm always jonesing to get moving or kill time *somehow*."
todayilearned,ffn15xi,t1_ffme262,1580060935.0,"It's funny, because people always used to complain about being ""cooped up in a cubicle"". Popular culture used cubicles to represent a loss of self and defeat.

Now everybody wants their cubicles back."
desmoines,ffmz61v,t1_ffmwgsx,1580060386.0,"I'm not doubting that it is. I just think sitting next to a police officer would put me at unease, which wouldn't be helpful in the early stages."
desmoines,ffmv309,t1_ffjmfri,1580059285.0,Thanks! I'll give them a call this week
desmoines,ffmsw70,t1_ffmg1rz,1580058574.0,"It was a joke. Still wouldn't want to learn driving from a cop, though."
desmoines,ffjc2e8,t1_ffizefo,1579995151.0,Yeah that's unacceptable. Being a responsible driver means not driving when you're too tired lol
desmoines,ffjbvbw,t1_ffj461v,1579995033.0,"Nice try, cops. Not gonna make it that easy to get my permit revoked."
desmoines,ffjb80k,t1_ffj24c8,1579994652.0,"Having a baby is common sense.

Just breathe and let the child out.

desmoines,ffix6ds,t1_ffip5nz,1579984893.0,What'd the instructor do?
AskReddit,ffij3aq,t1_ffhk7g5,1579975077.0,that sounds like something you should bring up with your parents.
AskReddit,ffhiv3n,t1_ffgoyvy,1579937244.0,but i like being circumcised. or at least it's never bothered me. i understand that it goes wrong sometimes but i don't think that's the intent whereas FGM is pretty much universally awful
WorkOnline,ffgquw0,t1_fffai3v,1579912741.0,"Everybody gangsta until the ombudsman shows up. 

Thanks for the info. I'm definitely going to be pursuing this, among other avenues, should they insist on not compensating."
WorkOnline,ffgpzo7,t1_ffg79hi,1579912115.0,I've made several attempts to reach out over the past two weeks. All of my messages have been ignored save for the first reply that stated they would get back to me. It's been radio silence ever since.

AskMen,fff321b,t1_ffetakh,1579874365.0,I guess I would just trust they feel that way whether they wore a ring or not
AskMen,ffeenqq,t1_ffdmc5g,1579845165.0,"why buy a bunch of cheap rings, though? seems silly to buy a $4 ring just for the purpose of saying ""i'm married"""
gaming,ffec4xy,t1_ffe6g4k,1579842742.0,"To GameStop's credit, one time I took a PS4 in to trade and a customer offered to buy it from me straight for $40 extra. The guys working there were completely cool with the haggle and even let him test it out before we made the deal.

Afterwards they informed me that the customer actually paid $100 more than they would've offered me as I had neither the stock HDMI cable nor the USB charging cable. Weird place."
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffe5tcl,t1_ffdxk6h,1579837468.0,"I used to see one of these guys on campus pretty often. He claimed he was raising money for the Boys and Girls Club of America, and that's why the candy costs extra. He would push the guilt angle *hard* if you blew him off. I was kind of ""whatever, everyone knows he's lying anyway"" about it until I saw him grift $60 off an elderly couple."

AdviceAnimals,ffcoie2,t1_ffbncr8,1579803840.0,"AFAIK in most states you can't get put in jail for civil debts (credit cards, loans, hospital bills). just stuff like not paying a criminal fine or child support. or not showing up to court for a civil debt. basically more for pissing off the courts than for the debt itself."
