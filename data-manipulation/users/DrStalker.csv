You've got half a dozen really unique planets to explore and you're stuck in a 22 minute time loop.  You progress by learning as a player what's going on (and the notes in your ship's computer don't reset) and decideing what you'll do in each loop to help advance your understanding first of what's going on and later of what you can do about it.

I hated that so much; you're randomly interrupted by unstoppable unavoidable enemies who drug you and teleport you across the made so you can watch an unstoppable video of a psychopath being a psychopath before a brief shitty mission (that probably takes less time than the unstoppable cut scenes) before you have to trek across the entire map to get back to what you were working on.

What finally made me quit was I wanted to talk to an NPC but all dialogue was locked because the regional villain was spewing some generic ""I'm an evil villain"" crap on the radio so no NPC would talk to me until that was done... felt like I spent more time passively waiting for boring and predictable scripted sequences than actually playing the game."
