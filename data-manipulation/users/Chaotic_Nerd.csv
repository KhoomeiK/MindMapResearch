Like I've lost friends in the past, and I can see where I went wrong/drove them away/was just in general too much to deal with. But more recently people tend to ghost me and I don't have a clue what I'm doing and its frustrating."

bipolar,ffvshzo,t3_evfw7v,1580271990.0,I'm the same way. When depressed shaving is the hardest thing to make myself do. It  sucks cause I cant grow nice looking facial hair so I look like a hobo till I finally feel better enough to shave.
