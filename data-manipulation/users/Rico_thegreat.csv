depression,fe6s6y9,t3_eo0jmu,1578902898.0,"I feel like that everyday still but I think the only way to avoid the worst case scenario is to just work hard learn to manage money, never give up and hey if you become a bum it’s because you aren’t working hard enough. And if that does happen it just means you haven’t figured it out yet which is 100% ok keep trying"
depression,fe51iri,t3_eno7v3,1578864821.0,I don’t think religion helps depression I think it’s finding a community of people who are going through the same things but trying to get better. I’m finding it’s less about religion and more about relationships you build with people who have faith

depression,fcpbmqc,t3_ei6338,1577857325.0,"Well you don’t have to work the job you have, and two you should just get out. Even though you don’t want to try going to a museum or something. Depression is a bitch and will make you lose joy in everything but you have to fight it. Even when you don’t want to you have to. I got called up by some friends last night and I made two excuses before they called me out to hang with them and it wasn’t much but it was honestly what I needed. I really just wanted to sit there and watch YouTube and creep on Facebook but that is so unhealthy! I said fuck that"

depression,fcp4d5c,t3_ei6338,1577850086.0,"I think the biggest thing for you to do is to find something social to do. You may not have any friends because of the isolation depression brings. I have tons of friends but have still been depressed because when we hang out we don’t do anything..... maybe try a sport, this year I’m dedicating my self to learn how to surf and kickbox and I’m hoping I can create a friend circle around these sports to where I can hang out and improve with friends and deepen relationships"
Adulting,fcp4456,t3_ei075k,1577849870.0,"You may be knocked on your ass for a few months just wanna say that... when it rains it pours, but the biggest thing is to create a routine, a schedule, stay active, go running, hit the gym... my biggest advice is to not isolate yourself at all."

Christianity,fcl2ls1,t3_ehedx7,1577738449.0,"As far as conquering temptation fully, is to be super human... we just can’t haha we’re in this world not of it so temptation is something we just have to push through but we also must remember we aren’t perfect, we are all born sinners"
Christianity,fcjnkhe,t3_ehedx7,1577695349.0,"Overcame porn... sooo I wouldn’t say I’m in the clear... im very much more aware though of masturbation.. I realized that a lot of the women in porn are there cause of sex trafficking or because they have some really serious issues that haven’t been dealt with properly. After watching an interview of Mia Khalifa, speaking about her regrets of porn I felt really bad cause I’ve watched like every video she made and masturbated to it... and I just felt like a piece of shit. I said to myself “Wow I’m literally finding pleasure in the lowest and most painful points of someone else’s life....” and that changed my entire out look on masturbation... I also realized that I used masturbation as a coping mechanism to cope with feelings of inadequacy as a teenager but the habit carried on into my early adulthood. I’m 24 now and have only masturbated like 4 times in the past 2 months which has been a huge huge huge improvement from 1-2x a day everyday for 12 years...  

I do have a relationship of 7 years and our sex life isn’t “normal” we only have sex like maybe 6 times a year due to the fact that we don’t have our own place and aren’t married. And even my outlook on that is changing... I’ve been making it clear that I only want to have sex in my apartment, or my home that I pay for, and I’m also making it clear that we have to dive into our health, that we can’t have sex drunk or under the influence like we used too... that it will eventually turn into like we won’t have sex till we’re married or try to refrain as much as possible because.. to be completely honest. I feel like sex is a gift.. something that is a huge blessing that when shared between two people who are happy in their skin and don’t need drugs or alcohol to numb their insecurities. And to have the pure intentions of connecting with that person on that kind of spiritual level is what will produce the best offspring you can,.. 

I think that’s why we have so many rules to abide by before we get married and have sex.... if two fully mature people come together, who have their finances in check, who have spiritualy on check, who have health on check, like that is what will
Literally produce the best offspring possible"
