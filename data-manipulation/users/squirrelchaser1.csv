I am exhausted and wanted a few memes before bed. I saw this and I fucking SWEAR I saw Marx's lips move as if he were gently flapping them like a goldfish.

TheRightCantMeme,ffi72us,t1_ffgukzj,1579966807.0,The spear tits design makes me so uncomfortable.
TheRightCantMeme,ffg0boc,t3_etauvn,1579895702.0,Ah yes because the ease of acquiring a machine designed to put holes in things from a distance because you're chronically paranoid is morally comparable to someones bodily autonomy and their choice to become a host for a fetus.

educationalgifs,fe0awk0,t3_en7hus,1578808154.0,Imagine having to explain to someone you met that your job is to sculpt the streamlined poop slide at the bottom of toilet bowls and them trying to parse this information.
enoughpetersonspam,fdb4r07,t1_fd8iwsn,1578253802.0,"Completely unrelated but something that made me chuckle. In the article on social justice term usage theres a spread of graphs that shows trends over time for a specific word. The first word I saw that had steady decline since the 70s is ""radio""."

educationalgifs,fcui34g,t3_egn4m4,1577981479.0,All the lines on its face makes me imagine its whole face openning up when it eats like something out of the thing. Film has tainted my impression of natural creatures.

ImaginaryTechnology,fc2vl99,t3_efqpry,1577375217.0,This kinda has a death stranding design vibe to it.
