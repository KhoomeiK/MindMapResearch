AskNYC,fejrkrp,t3_ep8px8,1579184086.0,"There's a lot of good advice here to help shake up your routine. 

Another thing to realize is that your outer circumstance changing won't really change your inner self. At least this is the Buddhist view, and it's proven true for me. 

It sounds like you need a little love/kindness/joy in your world - consider doing something out of character like taking an improv class, go to a service at the Brooklyn Tabernacle and listen to their amazing choir, head to Fort Tryon and go for a walk, volunteer with NY Cares. Anything to shake up your routine and help you shift perspective. 

And good luck. This is a tough town, it's normal to fall in and out of love with it. Like others mentioned, maybe moving away will be good too."
