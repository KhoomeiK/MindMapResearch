A one year vs 100 year fluke is perhaps just an indistinguishable tiny scale blip in geologic time. But we are concerned with living organisms. Tens of years is much more meaningful to us than billions - the void is unforgiving and unknowable. Put another way, coral can withstand one crazy year - they bleach and recover. But multiple bleachings in years too close together (trend) kills it outright. 10 year trends vs 1 bad year matters to us. It doesn't really matter to us right now if the sea level recedes in another 1000 years, if it drowns all our megacities built on the coast in the next 100."

Refineries are good at turning one kind of HC into another, by cracking big molecules and polymerizing smaller ones.

I'm not sure what you mean by this, but we could double or triple our renewables right now with no issue. Nuclear can provide baseload. We 100% have the technology to go neutral on the entire grid.

>What are the alternatives to combustion engines in cold climates?

They drive Teslas just fine in Canada, they're all over the place up there. Range is lower, but they make it work. You're correct that home heating will be more expensive. There's also biofuels (~10% of all gasoline for years now), carbon neutral synthetic fuels. For example, we can synthesize methanol out of nothing but water and CO2.

For plastic, we can make similar plant-based plastic, identical plant-based plastic, or even keep using oil for plastic. If we don't incinerate it and plug emissions in production, it's carbon neutral. Steel can be made with coke made from plants (charcoal), a lot of activated carbon is made this way already.

>Also the agriculture industry ...

We can make everything we need without oil. Haber process currently uses H2 from natural gas, but H2 is just H2. Sulfur may be one thing difficult to replace, honestly I'm not sure what the sulfur mining prospects are.

Or *we can just keep using oil* for those edge cases, and simply sequester the carbon, we can do it for [as little as $0.10/gallon of fuel](
http://www.innovationconcepts.eu/res/literatuurSchuiling/olivineagainstclimatechange23.pdf) - mining and grinding up minerals that lock away carbon, also are decent fertilizers. I've worked on traditional mechanical CO2 scrubbers, they will never compete with that, they're just too complex.

>Do you work in the energy sector? Are batteries really ...

Yes, quite a bit on the petrochem side, some green projects. I also have a Tesla. Range anxiety is very overblown. I've put about 30k miles on it, have only waited around for it to charge a handful of times. Less time than I'd have spent doing maintenance by now, have taken several 3-500 mi roadtrips. I don't see swappable batteries on cars - it already charges at nearly 600mi/hr. Though I think semis may do that. Trucking companies could set up depots on major interstates to swap out batteries. Diesel is a huge cost there.

EVs are the equivalent of ~$1/gallon gasoline - this will drive electric grid development, and smart meters can bring real time market prices to consumers allow EVs to smooth out the spikes and even sell back. There will probably be overbuilding of wind and solar - heavy industry can be set up to take advantage during periods of overproduction, even storing that energy in methanol or w/e. I'm not really sure if any large-scale electricity storage will pan out - we'll have to see what the free market decides. We just need to get started."
