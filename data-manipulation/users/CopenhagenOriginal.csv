bestof,ff7naq3,t1_ff6x9p9,1579653641.0,"I'm guessing he was looking to substitute ""infinite"" for ""perpetual"". That statement is correct. Show me any for-profit model in the US which doesn't strive for growth in the next quarters' earning reports.

The intention of capitalism is to efficiently acquire resources to lower costs and increase output efficiency. By nature, unless you're some off-the-wall normie who cares about morals, you're going to do everything in your power possible to make growth your number one priority. Growth = perpetual resource acquisition.

In doing whatever it takes to make the most money, you may do a cost-analysis to determine whether somebody could assess a certain aspect of your business which is inefficient, and they're paid to find any possible ability for you to save money. That could mean downright illegal acts (i.e. fines are cheaper than doing things the right way), or other things which are morally reprehensible, but not illegal in a market-operational aspect.

Money is being spent at an operational level to determine whether fucking over somebody is worth the cost instead of being devoted to making a unanimously better perceived product. All in the name of growing marginally more and more than the last quarter.

You know exactly which sorts of situations I'm describing. It is why there are specific agencies created by the government to limit their ""capitalism-ness"".

Capitalism without any sort of ""socialist"" integration is not human friendly by nature.

It is undeniable."
politics,ff79isc,t1_ff72gbc,1579643883.0,"Honestly, the DNC has made me so spiteful that I‚Äôd almost rather see Trump drag us through four more years of political feces in order for them to realize their shortcomings.

The thing the DNC doesn‚Äôt realize is how much untapped potential they have. They prefer to play it ‚Äòsafe‚Äô in their candidate-choice, and effectively have left us to deal with the burden of it by allowing Trump to win.

If the DNC gave an equitable endorsement to candidates like Sanders or Yang, with how much energy those two alone have created, they would handily manage beating Trump.

With all of the impeachment drama going on, the one question I like to ask Trumpers is 

‚ÄúRegardless of whether Trump is innocent, don‚Äôt you think it would have been at least more competent of him to go after someone other than Joe Biden? Biden can hardly make a sentence‚Äù

Maybe consider learning numbers and how to be interactive in public at most, like, to order food and buy stuff. I wouldn't expect anybody who isn't currently exposed to German at all times, every day, to be able to hold a conversation with a German in 10 months.

Because if you do attempt to be conversational, Germans will eagerly switch the conversation to English, and they're likely going to be much better than you expect. Many find it fun to use when they get an attempt to do it outside of school or business. Even as someone who has studied for years and has been lucky enough to have constant exposure, sometimes the best I can get is a compromise where I speak German and they speak back in English.
