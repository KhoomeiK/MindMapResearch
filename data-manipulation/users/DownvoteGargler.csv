Seattle,fe4dsf6,t3_enow8y,1578858224.0,This is going to be an unpopular opinion but I think Amazon made a mistake locating its campus in the city. I constantly get pinged by recruiters and don’t even reply because I would never drive in and out of that location every day. Had they set up on the east side they would have cheaper space and a much friendlier business climate. Their current campus also lacks a strong identity because its hard to know what’s Amazon and what’s not. It’s all a jumble. Microsoft’s Commons on the other hand is a major architectural nexus. On top of that MS is building another hub on east campus that is going to be equally awesome. It’s an amazing feeling to be working there.
