One more thing and I will be done. 

They had the 'best speakers they could find'. Okay. How many people di they ASK. Just those three would be my guess. Did they even extend an invitation to anyone else? Did they even attempt to contact any one else?"
GenderCritical,ff9i1so,t1_ff7l8b9,1579713464.0,"This is bothering me more and more. 

When you complain about the subject matter of the talks you should be clear that the material was not appropriate to the audience, it was stuff that hadnt been taught to the people attending. ( That was the issue right? ) And that there needs to be a conference series to bring the audience up to speed, or maybe they need to talk about the information that HAS been given.  

Sometimes I feel like women are deliberately sabotaged ( its not really JUST women, men love making everyone feel stupid). For example, I know a little about cars, car parts, and internal combustion engines. But I didn't go to school for it. Its got nothing to do with my job, and frankly it doesnt interest me much. I can still do some repairs and maintenance on my own and when talking about it I always make the disclaimer that I only know enough to tell when I can do a repair myself and when I should let a pro handle it. 

 But men in general cannot accept that. I was talking about replacing a fuel pump, it was literally a few bolts and one wire connection and took me about 30 minutes. But all the men I discussed it with ( they asked, I didn't volunteer) started in on fuel/air ratios, combustion rates, and devolved into a larp on street racing nitrous kits.  Dude. Its a 15 yr old Buick. I paid 2k for it, I am NOT dropping 15K I dont even have to fulfill your 2 fast hollywood racing fetish. I don't want to talk about it. Its doesnt relate to my situation AT ALL. Hell, it didn't relate to THEIR minimum wage life either. It felt like they were talking bullshit in an attempt to impress me or make me feel stupid.

 Your post reminded me of that so much. The speakers should have been aware of the knowledge level of the attendees and spoken about relatable subjects with a bit on next years curriculum. They shouldn't have spent the whole time masturbating to the fact they had many more years of experience.  That might be expected in some cases but doesnt sound appropriate to that particular venue. Its a deliberate attempt to discourage you and make you feel incapable.  

Its ridiculous.  You don't walk into college on the first day and get handed a degree. It takes many years to master a subject, especially one as complicated and as full of unproven theories as physics. A lot we know for certain, but a lot is still just an educated guess. Its OKAY if a first year student doesnt know as much as a 20yr tenured professor. Its NOT okay that the professor refuses to teach in a learnable manner. 

Another subject that pisses me off entirely is this screeching about nit being 'inclusive' every time women talk about WOMENS issues.  Please stand up and ask why they are excluding women. 

This whole 'exclusion' is just gaslighting and suppression. Its ridiculous to say that a woman is excluding a trans person by speaking about pregnancy, and then insist that pregnancy be excluded from the conversation. You want us to shut up because you can't get pregnant. We are not allowed to talk about issues that we CANNOT separate from our existence. That is EXCLUDING WOMEN. That is DISCRIMINATION.  You are being bigoted against us on the basis of biological reproductive capabilities. 

Asking women at a womens conference to not discuss our biology in relation to our careers is bigotry. Its exclusionary. Its sexism. Its discrimination and its inequity.  You stand up and tell them that. 

Women are used to being told to sit down and shut up. We just got to the point where we were starting to gain some confidence and starting to push for real equality and this is just a new spin on old misogyny. 

We have to push back or make spaces that are exclusive to females.  They give us no choice when they refuse to let us speak."

I took birth control for a number of years and didn't enjoy sex very much. I didn't desire it. I didn't get into it. I had no libido at all and could have happily went all those years with NO sex. Masturbation did little to nothing for me. Might as well play with my elbow.  I had no natural lubrication and it was always dry and painful or trying a different lube, turns out a lot have sugar ( seriously wtf) amd that causes yeast infections so I had that to look forward to. A lot of lubes dry up quickly and get sticky and that shit hurts. 


I tried the patch bc. It gave me migraines and a huge rash. 

I tried over 6 different brands of pill, all had horrible side effects ranging from severe depression to my hair falling out to severe non stop acne breakouts. Lets not forget the cramping and period flow so heavy I had to leave work and stay in bed with a towel under me. 


I tried the depo shot- and had a THREE MONTH PERIOD with major mood swings, crying randomly, and at one point was suicidal.  

I also got pregnant and had to scramble to pay for an abortion because I could barely afford to feed myself. Turns out some types of pill have to be taken at the EXACT same time every day. One delay of three hours ( because I was stuck in traffic after a major wreck on the interstate) was enough to render that pill ineffective. 

It turns out without artificial hormones I am a happy healthy person that doesnt suffer from clinical depression or anxiety. I don't break out with acne as an adult except rarely. I don't retain water to the point of high blood pressure. I don't bleed through a pad in under an hour. 

Stopping the artificial hormones was the best thing ever. I am not the same person at all. I WANT SEX. I enjoy the sex I do have. I get turned on. I masturbate and it feels good. I haven't needed to use lube even once, its an option and not a necessity.  I enjoy sex toys for the first time.  I have not had a single partner complain that 'You never initiate' Inwould have sex a few times a day if I could.

You know that trope that once you get married or have kids the sex ends? Yeah. Thats because of HORMONAL BIRTH CONTROL.  Imagine that. Next time your female partner is never in the mood and you feel they don't like you try sticking a condom on and dealing with a tiny amount of decreased pleasure. Its totally unfair to get angry and leave your partner because they have no sexual desire and also demand they take the very thing that KILLS desire because your poor sad penis can't deal with a tiny bit less stimulation."

It takes a while, but try to get replacements. I found for my own peace of mind it was better to trash that stuff than hold onto the negative emotions surrounding it. I think it was last year I ran across a tshirt we both used to wear. It went from storage to the trash. 

I do still have a few things now that I think about it. Some pictures, a really warm down coat that I have had for 15 years.  I think if he had ever said he liked that coat I would have replaced it by now. But he really didn't like it and wanted me to wear more 'feminine' ( read ugly, no pockets, not actually WARM). So now if I do remember him at all when I see it or wear it I giggle. 

Donate it, cut it to pieces, burn it, get some acrylics and fingerpaint it. There are some sentimental items I will never let go of even if it reminds me of him because that isn't the only meaning they have. But clothes are meant to be worn, and they wear out so I find it easier to let go when its something that I am going to dispose of eventually anyway.

  I shop a lot at goodwill and flea markets so I find lots of cheap items with a lot of wear left. 

And I don't know if you will relate, but the few times this subject has come up for me, it has seemed to me that the victims were more sentimental than average. I know I held deep meaning with some strange and pointless objects. I still do sometimes. Seeing the used stuffed animal bin makes me sad. There has been several things that were just plastic junk that I got very attached to. This was from before my abuse, but it also was a part of my abuse since abusers will target stuff you care about.  


 I have a hard time letting go of anything and I know I could end up being a hoarder if I am not careful to purge my home every few years. Those jeans I haven't worn in a couple years that I hope I can eventually fit back into, those lovely but impractical shoes I got last year that I never found an occasion to wear. It adds up and I care about those things. But sometimes a shot of vodka in my slushie and a garbage bag takes care of the excess clutter. I've lost everything so many times its hard to let go but I make myself clean out things I won't use because in the end, its just stuff. 

You can always find other clothes you love. You can also make new memories. Do what works for you. Sometimes its worth it to keep a reminder just so you can compare to how great it is without an abuser in your life."

I have a local church run resale shop ( like goodwill they take donations) and they will give free furniture to people who ask. One food bank I went to years ago would give a ten dollar voucher for a church resale shop for clothes.  A shirt there was 50 cents so it helped quite a bit. Be very nice, polite and grateful and they may throw in something extra for you. 

Some things that helped me a lot, a toaster oven. You can buy one for less than 30$ and make a lot of meals with it.  You don't need a whole stove if you have a hotplate or electric skillet.

  I really don't like microwaves but it could be useful to you. Some saran wrap and you can have easy baked potatoes. I found the microwave almost useless until I got one of these https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007M2BMQ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_9f5iEbY3GA9AT some things easy to make in that steamer are any type of noodle dish, like those side dish packets, or even boil noodles for mac n cheese ( its tricky but its doable. Use a lot less water heat the water first and stir often) in addition to rice you can also steam veggies. The steamer changed the way I think about microwaves. It makes the most amazing mashed potatoes. 

I like to use the steamer basket to cook stir fry veg, then take the basket out ( sit on a plate) rinse and make rice, then take a piece of salmon ( frozen is fine, just thaw it and slice thin) wrap the salmon in foil or saran with a few drops soy sauce and pat of butter. As soon as the microwave stops for the rice ( 8 mins for one cup rice) Take the top off add the fish packet ( just drop it on top and close it back up) . In about 15 min the heat already in the rice will cook the fish and finish the rice. 

A crock pot can do an amazing amount of cooking. Even better than a crock pot is a 'wonder bag' you should check out a few videos on youtube, you need to heat a pot up but use the bag to finish cooking which saves so much on your electric bill. I haven't got mine yet but its on the top of my must have list right now. You can even make one if you want, just use 100% cotton so it doesnt melt and scrap styrofoam, one video I watched was made with shredded foam fast food cups. 


Its hard. Its SO HARD to start over from scratch. But its better than being abused and it doesnt take long before you have everything you need. I left with what little I could pack in my car and my dog. Now, years later, I have too much stuff and need to clear out some clutter. I have learned to make friends. I have people who care about me. I have a decent job that covers bills. I have a bathroom that needs cleaning but I DON'T have anyone that is going to scream at me for waiting till tomorrow to clean. 

When I moved into this house I had a few bags of clothes, a few boxes of sentimental items, and a used twin mattress on the floor. Now everything is good and I am happy. 
This is how I know you will be okay. I did it and you can too. Its been hard, but I have had so many little moments of peace and happiness that I never got while I was with my abuser.  I can honestly say it is better to eat trail mix and beef jerky every day than spend another minute being terrified or anticipating the next blow up.

But captain marvel was more 'human overcoming adversity' even with the 'you can't do that because you are a girl' stuff. 

Those scenes and the criticism against them completely pisses me off because they whine its 'catering to feminism' when that shit is absolute lived and experienced reality for a lot of women.  FACT the US airforce DID have squadrons of women pilots that trained for years and never flew an actual mission. FACT many women my age will have experienced people telling us we shouldn't play sports or race go carts because its 'too dangerous' while our male peers were encouraged to do these 'dangerous' things. I remember sitting and seething with rage when I wasn't allowed to play outside during certain events ( family reunions, weddings, get togethers) because I might get dirt on my fancy dress but my male cousins got muddy all over and even my own mom said 'boys will be boys'.

You should put gaming aside for a while. Anything that keeps you from being sociable in real life should not have priority so use it as time filler and not a plan. 

Be single. You already have no friends. Concentrate on making FRIENDS and not hooking up or having a relationship. Its pretty damn important to your future happiness that you not get into a relationship while feeling you NEED a relationship. Thats feeding insecurity and not a healthy way to start a relationship. 

A lot of women will avoid you if they feel you want a relationship so soon after this toxic one ended. You 'opening up' is not a great idea if its venting about a previous relationship. Your new romantic partner does not want to be your shoulder to cry on about your ex. Save talking about that until the relationship is serious and even then you shouldn't go into detail.  Save that for your therapist, you pay them to help you unpack your negative emotions. 

People that don't have friends tend to try and dump all their issues on a romantic partner. This is overwhelming and give them emotional burnout. They are not there to fix you and if you try and stuff them in that role you are creating a toxic dynamic. That's really what long-term friends are for, but it takes years to get to that point.

This is where I was when I left my abuser. It took years to figure this stuff out and I am way better off for it. I am a lot closer to the person I want to be. Find who that is for you. Work on changing the habits that made your life toxic, I was a desperate for affection pushover.

If a man has 'no one to talk to' then he needs to get in therapy or make friends. This is a huge problem in relationships and most especially a huge problem in abusive relationships because the victim has a feeling of obligation to 'fix' or 'help' their partner when they have no idea how to give real help. Its not at all a healthy part of any relationship. 


You say its a 'turn off' when men talk about their personal struggles to women. I know exactly where that narrative comes from and its false. What is a 'turn off' is making someone else responsible for your mental well being or talking about your negative issues in general. As a woman no man has ever been cool with me dumping my anxiety and talking about my mental struggles unless I was paying them. The only time a man has ever cared about my problems is when they had a quick and easy solution. 

It also bothers me when men say its a 'turn off' for women, but also say they have no one else to talk to. That means you don't have friends or family of ANY sex that is willing to listen. That isn't a gender issue. 

Sorry not meaning this as an attack on you, I have just seen this narrative far too many times to let it go without saying something.

Yeah non binary can be on the scale. But unless you are a female person you are not by definition a lesbian. Because sometimes you feel like a man you are not always woman, because you identify as being in between you cannot be a lesbian because a lesbian is female attracted to females. LESBIAN IS NOT A WORD THAT DESCRIBES A SCALE. 

 Its not 'exclusionary' to say this because its true and you shouldn't attempt to be every group at the same time. You cannot be a Christian and an Atheist at the same time. You shouldn't feel the need to be part of every last circle. Its okay if you aren't a part of X group because you can be a part of Y group. You can even be several groups at once but you should not try to force a group to accept you when you don't fit the defined parameters for membership. 

This isn't an attack on anyone. This is a stand to keep meaning in language. Its really my reason for objecting to this,  no matter what you might be hearing from tras its really truly and honestly the REASON for MANY people that take issue with this.  Because words have MEANING and definitions have LEGAL MEANING. If a male bodied person that identifies as male, presents as male, and also identifies as lesbian and someone attacks them physically it is now a 'hate crime' because 'lesbian' falls under a LEGAL DEFINITION. And don't even get me started on that. I really dislike 'hate crime' laws, not because I hate certain people, but because I believe all violence that is not self defense should carry the same SEVERE penalties no matter the reason someone did it. Why should beating two different people to death carry two different penalties? Why not have murder=execution. Why do we have to consider their motivation like ANY reason is more justified? I know hate crime laws are supposed to add extra protection for certain groups. But why not make all penalties harsher, so it will strengthen protection for everyone? And if people are still getting attacked make it even harsher. Not ONE person should be getting beaten and assaulted regardless of any social group they belong to.

How is Buck being hateful by saying a lesbian is a woman attracted to women? And if you don't identify as a woman you cant be 'lesbian'.  Because words have actual meaning and if we let people use whatever words they want while using them incorrectly then we lose all ability to even have a conversation. Can a cis straight male identifying man be 'lesbian' too? Please explain to me why a non binary person cannot simply be 'non binary female-attracted' because to my understanding being male or female is your SEX and being attracted to a sex is your SEXUALITY which are two distinct things. Why exactly do they insist on a label that does not fit how they describe themselves? Sorry if this is offensive but to me it feels like when my nephew yells hes a dragon, and then barks like a dog and asks for dog treats. One of these things is not like the other and labels matter for others to understand you. 

No where do I see buck say non binary doesn't exist. I simply see him objecting to an inappropriate label. The backlash to him asking people used appropriate labels is hilarious to me when you consider how many people flip out that he calls himself transexual. Because he fits the dictionary definition. 

I also don't see why the dysphoria issue is even a debate. Dysphoria is a medical issue that literally defines being trans. If you don't feel uncomfortable being your born sex then why would you transition? Its a legitimate question that is asked my someone that had severe dysphoria. Can you not understand Bucks perspective? He transitioned at a time when he was literally one of the first FTM he is literally the case study.  His entire sense of self is caught up in body dysphoria and his entire identity is based on his dysphoria. I know this comparison will offend, but to me its the difference between having cancer and having someone say that they identify as a cancer patient.  I don't understand why this concept is so horrible when you can simply identify as something you are instead of something you do not fall under the definition of. It just seems deliberately convoluted."

Buck was one of the first FTM trans persons to medically transition. His transition literally set definitions for certain things. Buck identifies as 'transexual' which for some reason pisses off 'trans rights activists' even though he identifies that way because he fits the dictionary description of a transexual person. Somehow this is offensive to the same people that get pissed when you don't agree with their personal definition of what they identify as, so its pretty damn hypocritical to say he is somehow evil because the way he identifies himself is offensive when its the literal meaning of the word.

This one the top in one of your first 'references' of why Buck is supposed to be a horrible person.

>since i've seen absolutely no mention of trans masc ppl being hurt by this buick angle thing,  

Are you kidding me. This person doesn't even know WHO Buck is. It seems the whole thread is people spreading rumors with no facts. Did YOU read the threads you quote?? 

You also link a thread where there is a screenshot of buck saying that the word lesbian is 'women loving women' and includes people who 'identify' as women. 

How is that a problem? I fail to see any issue with stating that a lesbian is a woman attracted to women.  Below that, someone says they are a 'non binary lesbian'. ( if this is even serious) To BE a lesbian you have to ( by definition) identify as a woman attracted to women. How can you be a not-woman and be lesbian? Why can't they just simply say they are non binary attracted to women because that is exactly what they are defining themselves as?   I have felt for a while that these so called 'allies' are just trying to co-opt words and insert their own definition. Its making a lot of people stop taking trans rights activists seriously. 

And talking about Natalie and Blair White like they are leading armies to hurt trans people, when they ARE trans people, should be allowed to identify as 'transexual'' if they so choose ( because they fit the textbook definition) and are sharing their OWN experiences and the language they relate to.... I completely fail to see how this does anyone any harm and I would really like someone to explain that to me in terms other than ' what this person identifies as is offensive to me' because that sounds like another flavor of terf to me. 

I also take issue with people who get offended with the word 'transexual' or the definition of 'lesbian' and think its okay to use a slur like truscum (true scum). We have words and definitions of those words for a reason. I don't consider myself a 'terf' but maybe I am if I think a non binary female attracted person should just call themselves by the thing they identify as? Im pretty cool with trans women calling themselves women and presenting as feminine and using feminine pronouns. I take serious issue with male identifying and presenting people calling themselves 'lesbian' because we already have a defined word for that. To a point it feels like the actual DEFINITION of words is what TRAS get offended about the most and to be absolutely fair this is stupidity because it shuts down all possibility of having an actual discussion while allowing tras to be 'offended' about everything and anything that doesn't fit their own personal arbitrary self imposed definitions.

Then have the bride stroll in wearing a gorgeous bright deep color ball gown or evening dress. Let mil show up matching every other guest ( or at least the majority) and watch the bride waltz in wearing a bright orange taffeta tea length gown or something of the sort.

TAMPICO DOESN'T NEED TO BE REFRIGERATED. 

Its obvious to me that they just ran out of whatever is supposed to be in this space ( or may be a new store waiting on product). 

This stuff is just to look nice until the real product gets there. Leaving shelves empty is a huge no no in retail. This is literally just placeholding.

Edit because.  Just to clarify, this product is 'refrigerate after opening'"

LifeAdvice,fd69j42,t1_fd5ag1n,1578187591.0,"Relationships are going out of style, not everyone you know is in a relationship and not many of those are happy. You are on a self destructive spiral and you should run the other way from anyone willing to jump in and play savior, its either a scam or a control freak. Learn to love yourself and have something more in your life than living for others.

Would you date you right now? The person thats losing their job and home and wallowing in self pity? You need some form of medication and therapy and you probably won't because you are so self hating BECAUSE you need medication and therapy. 

If your relationship is the only thing you have going for you thats worse that putting all your eggs in one basket. Thats demanding that someone else carry the basket for you. 

Its also super abusive to say to a partner that you don't have anything to live for without them ( lets not argue that you did or didn't say it, if you are in a relationship long enough the other person knows you think that way) . If you don't get help, stop feeding this self pity and learn to care for yourself, then you won't have a relationship, you will have a hostage situation.  

I used to think I was supposed to do everything for someone else, that my only meaning in life was to make someones elses life easier. Then I got abused and used a couple times. Now I am happy to be single and like who I am rather than try to be what someone else wants me to be. 

Find your own happiness. The meaning of life is to be the best you that you can. Not to foist all your issues into someone else's hands because you can't win that way."

Op has a point but that just doesn't work for millions of working parents. If I had to choose between sending my sick kid to school and losing my only means of keeping a roof over their head I would choose to send them to school because I had no other choice.

LifeAdvice,fctk24a,t3_eiovwg,1577946070.0,"You have to find a life for yourself. Its completely unfair to expect a romantic partner to be your personal therapist and reason for living. Its a completely unreasonable goal both for yourself and them. It might be a reason you can't connect with anyone. I know I would much rather be single than be on such an unstable pedestal. If you want someone to FIX you, that needs to be between YOU and a trained therapist. 

Find a therapist and get some actual help. Trying to find or make a romantic partner responsible for your... Everything... Is like going to McDonald's and demanding a 5 course gourmet meal. They have neither the ability or experience to give you that. The same goes for all the people you keep asking for 'help'. They have no idea what 'help' you even need, they are just doing what they are able and its not their fault that its not what you need. 

 Humans are usually pretty flawed and very few people have their shit together enough to have their own life under control. You are going to have a very hard time finding someone that enjoys being the ruler of YOUR universe when they barely understand their own. 

You also seem to expect unconditional love, which doesn't exist. If you truly want a happy and satisfying relationship you need to see a professional and stop this self sabotage.  First thing tomorrow, start calling and make an appointment to see someone."
SelfAwarewolves,fcszg88,t1_fcr463h,1577928968.0," Just a quick sidenote, I keep watch on all these types of movements. I started watching gender related hate cults almost ten years ago as a relation to my interest in feminism, domestic abuse, and social cultures. Sort of an ongoing self-education research project. 

I might get downvoted or banned for this, but in the interest of balanced discussion, not all people under the 'gender critical' banner are massive hateful Aholes. Many are in fact critical of the concept of gender roles and expectations but we should also acknowledge the fact that there is a vocal minority that preach hate. There are a whole lot more that are closer to the woman in this video https://youtu.be/9t_oDOhhjmI 


 I always try to keep my own balance and not buy into hate. I don't think all of them are doing this to preach violence and I find it interesting that the few I have found that do dont limit it to trans people but are also highly racist and misogynistic and almost always advocate for ""manosphere"" issues ( I wont post names or links to the violent ones because I dont belive in giving them more views).  Its hard for me to watch someone like Blair White and condemn them as a TERF preaching violence and hate. I welcome any discussion on this, and any youtube links for those on any side of this issue ( preferably not mainstream media or public figures) that anyone wants to pm me.   I am not here to argue one side or the other."

I don't have a picture of the door my ex destroyed. Luckily I wasn't home that time. Unluckily, he took it out on me when I did get home. 

We should not need specific photographic evidence to be believed. 

Unfortunately some jackass decided that domestic violence was a joke. Every day millions of people make all sorts of 'jokes' about abusive behaviors. Isn't it time to stop laughing and point out the truth, that these things happen. Honestly I am not surprised it was a 'joke' that is the only way we can view male violence that has been pointed out by women, without that woman making herself a target for the bile of online trolls. 

I am long past the idea that all examples put forth need to pass verification. People don't believe that victims of domestic violence are telling the truth. Being female means no one believes you, and if they do then they will blame you for your abuse.  But mostly, no one believes you. In fact, there is a societal assumption that if you are female, you are lying. We see it over and over and over everywhere. We see it time and again in mainstream. And it honestly doesn't matter what the subject is, women are not believed. Not by law enforcement, not by the justice system, not by coworkers, not by medical professionals, probably not by their own family. 


Certainly not by media which you can find examples over and over as they drill the idea that a tiny percent of false accusations are somehow a bigger problem than the millions of women are being abused. In fact, if you believe the media then the only abuse victims are the ones that have been murdered and make a good catchy story, but of course they somehow 'deserved it'. 


 Being female means you are held to a higher standard than men in everything except physical strength. And even IF you manage to jump through all their hoops they WILL attempt degrade your credibility. Here is just a short bit of Anita Hill's testimony. https://youtu.be/4oPnd911FcM  I don't think it would be much different if it was happening now. 

I give up on this concept that every single post and comment and word by women has to be 100% verified fact with evidence, witnesses, and receipts. 

Memes as example are enough for the purpose of the movements.  Because the truth is it happens and it is largely undocumented. And the truth is also that men are assumed to be telling the truth, while women are assumed to be lying. When we know men are lying they are still defended and excused as doing it for noble reasons. While women, even when tge have evidence are still dismissed as liars, or as being 'emotional' or 'hormonal' or just plain 'dramatic'. 

Extremely few victims will come forward in a public setting.  When you post a real picture like this, you are opening yourself up to all the abusers online that will then send nasty messages and threats. You already have an abuser, you don't need dozens of online ones too. 

Even though this sort of thing happens A LOT, we don't have a lot of people tweeting their abuse. 

I worked for several years as a property manager/deep cleaning service/painting/general repair.  I wrote all that because I have seen a LOT ( at least 30-40) such broken doors in my years. And many many more where the doors were just missing ( cleaned up before we got there) but there were fist size holes and kicked holes and dents in every one of those houses. Those signs of physical domestic violence were probably in about 20% of all the houses I saw. 

The average victim of domestic violence will plan for months and take several tries before they are able to leave. One thing I can confirm from experience is that posting such a thing, or even taking a picture of it, would have gotten me hit at least as many times as that door in the picture. You say we have plenty of real life examples, I haven't seen that many that were not news reports. 

I still think this is a great example of male violence. I would love to find the video as it will show how quickly and easily he breaks it apart, something that few women would even think of doing, let alone try. 

Call it a meme. Its still accurate and should not be dismissed as a joke. 

Ive had a long month. So if you don't read it all or respond at all it makes no difference. I just need to get it out."
