Utter, utter bullshit. This is a lie we've been fed all along. People on zero hours can still get told when they have to work. They just also get told when they're not working. You can only pick and choose when you work or take holiday if you're being paid a handsome reward for being so flexible. Most people on zero hours are not being paid handsomely.

And companies using zero hour contracts add clauses so you effectively can't take other ""gigs"".

These companies don't want you to be able to pick and choose when and where you work. They want cotton pickers waiting at home for a warm day.
