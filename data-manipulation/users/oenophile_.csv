FemaleDatingStrategy,ffizwgt,t3_etwgde,1579986864.0,"I stopped watching porn and spent a year intentionally celibate, which helped me reconnect with myself and my feelings and better understand my relationship to sex and to men. I've also spent a lot of time in therapy working through trauma and low self worth and damaging patterns with men. I think if you find a truly trauma informed therapist they will better understand that BDSM is not always (and perhaps only rarely if ever?) a healthy sexual dynamic and support you in working through your feeling and your feelings about your feelings. I also started attending women's meetings for sex and love addicts anonymous where I also got support and understanding and felt a lot less alone. You can heal and learn to have a healthy, fulfilling relationship, it will just take some work."
GenderCritical,ffijc1g,t3_etp215,1579975240.0,"I can really relate to a lot of what you are sharing here. A few things have helped me a lot....working through this stuff in addiction recovery communities (for me, it's been sex and love addicts anonymous, I generally stick to women's groups for that, adult children of alcoholics and other dysfunctional families, and some Buddhist and yoga recovery communities). People in addiction recovery can relate to the experience of being out of control of your behavior and the distress it causes and struggling with hating yourself for it and grappling with huge amounts of trauma, all while people in your life really don't get it. Just having a space where you can be honest and not be judged or misunderstood and to hear from other people struggling with similar things can offer huge relief. The other thing is therapy with a trauma-informed professional. I can't stress enough that they be trauma-informed; if they are not, they can do more harm than good in situations like this. Other practices that can help you get in touch with your body again in gentle ways, like breathing practices and yoga, and with your thoughts and feelings, such as through journaling, can help a lot too. Be gentle with yourself as you travel this very challenging path."
selfimprovement,ff3ukca,t3_erfaax,1579549170.0,"This might be an unpopular sentiment, but it honestly it sounds like people are putting a lot of pressure on you. Getting everything you could ever want is not all that it's cracked up to be. I was born into a working class family that was probably the polar opposite of yours, but I have climbed the social ladder and now spend my time around a lot of upper class/wealthy people and their lives often seem pretty miserable, despite so many people believing that money & stuff & status = happiness. It doesn't. Obviously having money and freedom is great in a lot of ways and solves a lot of problems, but having a lot of stuff brings its own burdens and pressures, and having people treat you like you're something special and precious rather than a fellow human is not as fun as you think it's going to be. The sheer number of possibilities that become available when you have the support, freedom, money, you have can be paralyzing. And if you have no need to take care of yourself, it is easy for motivation to drop off entirely and to feel entirely purposeless. Plus, no one feels bad for rich, privileged people, so it's easy to hate yourself or feel like something is wrong with you because all the random garbage people are buying you isn't making you happy. I would have not appreciated being gifted a snake either; it's ok to clearly communicate that you really appreciate the sentiment and that your mom wanted to do something nice for you, but that you don't want to be responsible for a snake and that you'd rather she spend the money on whatever experience or thing you'd actually enjoy. 

I would recommend you stop beating yourself up so much and try to practice a bit more self-compassion. You don't deserve to hate yourself. Try to practice some more self-inquiry, maybe through journaling, about what you really want and how you really feel about things. What would the best possible version of yourself in 6 months look like? What kind of life would they be living? What is actually important to you? What makes you feel good about being alive? What stresses you out about your current life? Why does it stress you out? How could you change those things that stress you out? When you get a better sense of who you are and what you want, you will be in a better position to get clearer in your communication with people and set boundaries in a way that is respectful of yourself and the other person without feeling irritable or angry or lashing out.  
 
Since you have money and freedom, maybe you could look into therapy, or things like personal growth retreats or meditation retreats. Immersion in other cultures (in a real way, not in a cushy rich way where you are insulated from the actual culture) or reading books (maybe memoirs, books on minimalism, philosophy, ancient wisdom traditions?) can also help you open your mind and question what you've been taught about how you should only ever be grateful for being buried in expensive shit. Stuff like that can help you get some clarity on yourself and what you want and how to construct a life that feels better to you."

GenderCritical,fet5p32,t3_eqifdl,1579372065.0,"Thank you for sharing your experience here. Your story is fascinating to me, because even though our background might seem completely different on the surface, it sounds like there is so much more similarity in our experiences than I would have guessed. I'm not sure if you have shared more of your experience elsewhere but I'd love to understand it better?"
CPTSD,fep91y9,t1_fep7d1w,1579314865.0,"I haven't spent a ton of time with IFS, but I have found it to a really helpful model. Maybe you can think of it not as betraying your mom, but as taking over for her so you can now mother yourself? No one's moms were meant to care for them forever, so I don't think it need feel like a betrayal. Now that you are an adult, you are your own primary caregiver and it can be helpful to be intentional and thoughtful about what kind of caretaker you want to be for yourself. I have been helped by the book Self Therapy by Jay Earley. It's provided a much more compassionate model of how to relate to and understand myself, and helped me to better recognize the ways I'm not being compassionate with myself in ways that I hadn't realized before."
CPTSD,feozkfg,t3_eq8us4,1579308816.0,"My background is not exactly the same but I am undoing a lot of trauma bonding, from childhood and adulthood, and learned helplessness. Your first paragraph in particular really resonates. A lot of things (therapy, EMDR, ACA, meditation, yoga for trauma, somatic body work) have helped in some ways, but what has allowed me the most progress is MDMA therapy and psilocybin therapy. I don't know how I could do this without something as powerful as those have been. I recognize that it's not for everyone but that's what's been true for me."

getting_over_it,fdhnb5h,t3_eldwdc,1578426275.0,"It sounds like you and I have had really similar experiences. What is most important right now is not ""working on yourself"" but finding ways that you can feel safe and restore feelings of safety and trust in yourself. It takes a lot of work and a lot of time and a lot of gentleness and compassion, from yourself and others. You need a trauma-informed therapist; a lot of therapists simply aren't qualified to help with trauma and their ""help"" can make things worse. It's so important to find people that can understand where you're at and listen with understanding and without judgment and without needing to ""fix"" you or explain to you why you're wrong or why you shouldn't feel this way or that. I can't write more right now but if you would like more advice or just to chat feel free to PM me or we can chat here in the comments. Hold on, friend, things won't always be this dark and painful."

aspergers,fcaingg,t3_egwor7,1577569895.0,"For what it's worth, I think it's legitimate. I'm not really sure why it is that people often seem to demand such a higher degree of systematic assessment for autism as compared to other mental health conditions, and imagine that it can only be recognized by a a very specific type of specialist doing a very specific assessment. You have had two different mental health care professionals observe you over what sounds like a good bit of time and come to these conclusions that you agree makes a lot of sense in characterizing and explaining your life and experience. You could get an ""official"" diagnosis if you think it'd be helpful or if you find that it will give you access to certain resources or accommodations that you couldn't otherwise access, but it seems pretty clear what the diagnosis is going to be.

You very well could have both CPTSD and be on the spectrum. It's very common for people on the spectrum to experience trauma and to be more affected by it than others. It's really unfortunate that this isn't more widely understood, imo, but there is not a very wide understanding even of trauma at this point."
PsilocybinMushrooms,fca9uon,t3_egvawk,1577565324.0,"I saw this last week and loved it. I was amazed by the cinematic beauty of it and how much info they packed in, far beyond just the psychedelic properties of mushrooms. Highly recommend as well."
Psychonaut,fca59ie,t3_eguqz5,1577563250.0,"He was not Tim Leary's professor; he was a colleague who was instrumental in getting Tim Leary hired as a fellow professor at Harvard and was the director of the center under which Leary did his psychedelic research while at Harvard. He supported the research while it was being conducted, and even when issues first arose within the university, and then later turned on Leary and Alpert when the scandal became public. His criticisms of psychedelics and the research on them were entirely self-serving; it was the only way for him to not get taken down as Leary and Alpert were. Not really the kind of person I have a lot of respect for."

Moving to the PNW sounds amazing. I think changing your environment can make a really big difference. I am hoping so anyway, and that has been my experience in the past.
