step1,ffipbtb,t1_ffikt2x,1579979365.0,"Edit: not sure why I buried this in the text below.  Probes are 1) intranasal and 2) at a reference (skin) site -- i.e. a spot unaffected by whatever crap you're doin in the nose

Haha oh...

I was talking about the kidney (where amiloride is usually relevant).

I know from studying cystic fibrosis that chloride inhibits ENaC on its *extracellular* domain.  Summarizing, in CF: decreased Cl secretion into nasal mucus --> release of ENaC inhibition --> increased Na reuptake --> decreased (less positive) resting membrane potential.

However, my understanding is that when testing for CF, you compare the potential between nasal mucous **and a distant reference site** before and after an amiloride challenge (reference probe placed at a standard point on the skin) .  If Cl- channels are not diseased (i.e. you don't have CF), amiloride-->decreased Na flux INTO cell from mucus --> ~~increased~~ decreased Cl- flux OUT --> **decreased** Cl- ~~inhibits~~ **activates** ENaC --> Na flux ~~drops~~ **rises** towards baseline --> resting potential doesn't change much (becomes only slightly less negative) because the Cl flux **decrease** *inhibits* the ~~increase~~ **decrease** in Na flux (i.e. promote ENaC activity).

Compare this to what's seen in CF:First, initial (pre-challenge) potential is much higher because: decreased Cl efflux at rest --> decreased ENaC inhibition --> increased Na+ uptake --> more negative mucus relative to reference potential.

Then, when challenged with amiloride, the effects are dramatic.  While the mutation is obviously in chloride channels, the primary driver of the altered nasal potential is overactivity of ENaC secondary to low chloride, and amiloride directly blocks this channel.  So, inhibit ENaC --> hyperactive Na flux drops WAY off --> nasal mucous potential moves strongly towards 0.

Does this help?  The core take-homes are 1) the gradients (which direction will X flow) 2) the fact that extracellular Cl- inhibits ENaC and 3) the fact that probes are comparing nasal mucous to an unrelated reference potential (usually a standardized skin site).

step1,ffiljh9,t1_ffije1j,1579976761.0,"Well, I don't have any specific evidence that it does -- I don't think it's a clinically relevant effect (should it exist), I was just thinking about OP's likely point of confusion.

That being said:

Diminished luminal K+ efflux --> increased intracellular K+ --> increased basolateral K+ gradients --> **increased basolateral K+ efflux** \--> more negative resting potential.

A super, super important thing to realize about membrane potentials is that they are NOT really determined by bulk concentration.  Bulk concentrations will make it to electochemical equlibrium really damn fast -- if you pick any given point in the center of the cell *it will be electrically neutral!!!*  (Cells are generally NOT big bags of static charge.)  Instead, it is differential *flux* across the membrane that matters.

So, in terms of the effect of elevated intracellular \[K+\], the take home is that flux across the membrane (i.e. increased K+ leak) is far and away the dominant effect.  Changes in bulk intracellular \[K+\] are small and rapidly normalized, and we only even think about them (as in my --> above) in terms of how they ultimately effect membrane flux.  In other words, increased intracellular \[K+\] should be considered a transition state effect, not an outcome..."
step1,ffieu8f,t3_etsvcr,1579972181.0,"I might be misunderstanding, but...

Is it possible you're thinking of transluminal potential?  I agree, if you're thinking about resting, basolateral membrane potential, amiloride would be expected to hyperpolarize the cell, and a quick google gives me the sense that, outside of its effect on the luminal membrane of principal cells in the kidney, that is exactly what it does.  (one [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs004240050248), among many)

But in the kidney, basolateral resting potential isn't the variable that matters.  The transluminal potential, however, matters a lot, and *does* become less negative (as part of the primary mechanism of diuresis and the major, highly predictable side-effect of hyperkalemia):

ENaC blockade--> diminished Na uptake from lumen (diuresis) --> diminished electrochemial gradient for K+ efflux--> diminished K+ leak from apical membrane (hyperkalemia) --> diminished /more positive resting potential at **luminal**/apical membrane.

Note that you do not see these effects at the basolateral membrane.  The driving forces for K+ efflux are far less dependent on \[Na\] (and much more dependent on the very strong chemical K+ gradient), and ENaC channels are not expressed on that side to begin with.  Thus, the basolateral resting potential remains largely unchanged (even slightly more negative, due to the increased intracellular \[K+\] and resulting increased K+ leak from the basolateral membrane).

Does this help?  (Worried I may have totally misinterpreted your question...)

Edit: If you have a source telling you the basolateral potential gets less negative, I'd love to get a link..."

step1,fefy9kc,t3_eoqyuk,1579069272.0,"On the left shift: Similar idea to CO poisoning.  While the effect isn't nearly as extreme, oxidizing Fe shifts electrons around in the porphyrin ring in a way similar to what happens upon O2 binding, and you see a similar series of downstream changes.So, In a nutshell:Fe oxidation -> porphyrin ring chemistry changes --> conformational change in affected subunit that simulates O2 binding --> O2-bound conformation stabilized in other 3 subunits --> left shift.

The SaO2 decrease is simply because there are less binding sites available.  Should be noted that as the disease becomes increasingly severe, your (falsely high) SaO2 reading will bottom out at 85% (the color of the Fe3+ heme complex looks to the sensor like blood at 85% saturation, even though no oxygen is bound).  So you can go from nbd to big problem within a pretty narrow range of pulse ox readings...

Edit: note also that the 85% reading reflects the changes in the porphyrin ring (which is the primary absorbing moiety in Hb, in the visual range) I talk about above, which in turn drives the conformational changes responsible for the left shift.  In other words, you can literally *see* the effect of iron oxidation on the porhyrin ring, and it's a straight conceptual line from that chemical change to all the changes in the Hb subunit / tetramer and eventually all the clinical findings and hemoglobin O2 dynamics.

But I did a little more digging, and I don't think your explanation is accurate:

While the Na/K-ATPase is obviously electrogenic, the vast majority of the resting membrane potential is determined by leak channels (primary K+, but also Na+, Cl-, Bicarb, and H3O+).  While those leak channels ultimately depend on the action of the Na/K-ATPase, the resting membrane is *so* much more permeable to K+ than it is to Na+ that you would see erasure of K+ gradients long before Na+ influx can depolarize the cell -- which is not a physiologically relevant situation (except perhaps in rhabdo...)

The picture painted by the articles I found is 1) that we don't really understand the mechanism for sure but that it likely has to do with 2a) a drop in K+ conductance (which has been experimentally demonstrated, with the presumed mechanism being closure of K+ leak channels at very low potassium levels) or 2b) nervous system irritation overriding direct effects on muscle.  The theory here, as I understand it, is that if hypokalamia knocks out inhibitory interneurons via hyperpolarization --> alpha motor neurons fire --> muscle is stimulated to a degree which *overcomes* the hyperpolarizing (and hence relaxing) effects of ~~hyperkalemia~~ hypOkalemia.

So, pressure drops, *precipitously*.  But then the aortic valve slams shunt and pressure rebounds a bit as the blood that would otherwise backflow is trapped in the stressed volume by the aortic valve -- conceptually at least, you can think of this 'trapping' as adding a little bit of volume to the stressed compartment in the moment the aortic valve closes.
