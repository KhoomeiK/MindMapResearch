AskReddit,ffjikrm,t1_ffjcswt,1579999019.0,"I was kind of the same way, but I rooted for him until the end. He was the bad guy and a horrible person but for whatever reason I just got on his ship and decided to go down with it. The guy on the bottom getting pushed around and deciding not to take it anymore really resonated with who I was at the time."
todayilearned,ffimb2n,t1_ffikwab,1579977290.0,I just explained the things fine about it. Get some friends or a TiVo and stop bitching so much.
todayilearned,ffiibv9,t1_ffigl4o,1579974551.0,"The ads are fine when you’re watching at like a party. It gives you time to refill drinks, get food, socialize and then it quiets down after the game is back on. When I watch by myself I record it and watch later and skip ads. Works pretty well."

coolguides,ffbsmha,t1_ffbrrrf,1579781218.0,There’s literally dozens of comments in this thread alone that proves you wrong.
worldnews,ff69mir,t1_ff66c7s,1579622356.0,Your diet probably isn’t that bad. You may eat bad food but you don’t eat too much of it. 95% of weight loss is in the kitchen.

coolguides,fezkmy4,t1_feyrahd,1579458316.0,"You typically get things out when you set up camp. Stuff that’s on top. Like food, clothes, cooking gear. Also a lot of pack have either a separate compartment for sleeping bag, or a bottom entry opening to get to it. I kept my quilts in a trash bag in the bottom of my pack and there was no unwarranted expending of entry to get my stuff out lol."
CollegeBasketball,feume5i,t1_feukh70,1579387911.0,Are Kentucky fans like this in every game thread?
CollegeBasketball,feulx9n,t1_feukjag,1579387789.0,Moscow Mitch allowed Kentucky residents to come work them for us since coal is dead and no one in Kentucky has a job.
Cringetopia,fetr5k9,t1_fetq90o,1579378696.0,"Yes, you aren’t wrong on their growth promoting feed, I just took issue with calling them antibiotics. That’s not quite what they are. Also the housing system you’re describing does have “free range” options. At least with turkeys and some chickens. Tyson I think is one that doesn’t allow it. They’re not a good one to farm for. Butterball is pretty decent though. The only thing they make my buddy do is use special grain. He’s got a system where they can go outdoors and even at full capacity there’s plenty of room indoors for the birds."
Cringetopia,fetp2dp,t1_fet484f,1579377852.0,"Most of this info is wrong. Chickens aren’t given antibiotics to grow bigger. They’re bred that way. They’re given antibiotics to stop them from getting sick. Also this doesn’t happen as much and is going away. Pigs aren’t kept in those cages. Those cages are for when sows are nursing piglets so she doesn’t smash them, which commonly happens. 

The conditions you’re describing are where the animals spend the last part of their lives before being slaughtered. They’re terrible, awful places and I don’t agree with them, but that’s not where the animals spend their lives. 

They mostly spend them in pastures. They are then sold at market and sent to the factory farms you’re describing. Also the chicken houses aren’t quite that bad. They have a decent amount of room to run around, have windows that open and some have outside access. Again, not ideal at all and I don’t agree with it, but your comment is very very misleading."
