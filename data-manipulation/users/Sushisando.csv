asianamerican,ffcgxlg,t1_ffcg6tl,1579799224.0,thank you for commenting. I didn’t get past the paywall and felt passionate about the article title so I went off half-cocked. I get annoyed when people comment off topic when they didn’t read the article and then I did the same ass thing.
asianamerican,ffcbitm,t3_estzrg,1579795875.0,"Unchecked power = discretion. This is the official term for when they make judgement calls. When I was an immigration advisor for international students, I often got calls from CBP officers when they weren’t sure if a student should be allowed entry to US. Luckily, most students I advocated for were allowed to enter and come to university. 

But I did have to narc on a former student who tried to come back to US on long expired documents. He failed out of uni, left US, and then tried to re-enter when he wasn’t a student anymore. 

Final note- ICE visited me and wanted to know why my university had ‘so many’ students/scholars from Iran. 

I have so many stories about people who were allowed to enter but shouldn’t have and so many people who were detained for no legitimate reason. I’m so glad I got out the immigration field for work because the stress, low pay, and lack of resources was depressing and I was an anxiety ridden mess. One small data entry could equal detainment or deportation."
