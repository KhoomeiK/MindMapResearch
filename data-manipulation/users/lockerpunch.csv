Even if he's said you'll get a raise at a specific time, knowing they could be losing a good employee can speed up the raise process. If he does counter, make sure it's in writing.

AskWomen,fdest5x,t3_ekvi2h,1578345867.0,"Growing up, I absolutely hated my name. No can pronounce it the first time (save one or two wonderful linguistics professors), and then people mispronounce it even after I've corrected them tons of times. It's not difficult to pronounce it's just not spelled the way it sounds. Not to mention the nickname people use is something wildly common so I get a lot of ""oh like \_\_\_"" and then people tend to think they're funny and original.

I still get the occasional joker, but most adults now say it's beautiful and original and I've grown to love my name. I just had to get out of high school. I've never met another person with my name, though according to the internet there are others. I would never change it. My parents spent a lot of time coming up with it and my middle name.

AskWomen,fc5rbby,t3_eg7srq,1577464207.0,"People just noticed me. I wasn't overweight or anything, I just didn't care about my appearance or fashion or anything - no makeup, just brushed my hair, wore whatever, didn't shave much. For me, school was strictly about learning and getting through so I could go to college. Once in college, I still didn't care and I had the same mindset. It wasn't until I got my first job out of college that I befriended this woman who to me was absolutely beautiful and she was kind. And for some reason I decided I could do both and I wanted to be just like her. I think it was the first time a very attractive person took notice of me and was friendly to me. Before I was largely ignored.

I went shopping alone, put on makeup, did my hair, plucked, shaved and the response was ridiculous. Up until then (maybe 21 or so) I hadn't had a single boyfriend. I hadn't even been asked out on a date.

Now I was getting attention everywhere I walked. People were holding doors open for me, offering seats to me. I got discounts at bars and restaurants for no reason I could see (I always polite to wait staff). Now I was being asked out constantly, men and women comment on my style.

I went from being ignored to being seen. It was eye opening. I like the attention fine, but it was overwhelming at first and very opening to how looks still matter."
relationship_advice,fc5pqpz,t3_eg3q65,1577463341.0,"It was rude of them to laugh and make such comments, but like enough people have said the bigger issue is your boyfriend. You can't control how the family reacts and you don't really know them. You should know your boyfriend and he should have defended you. At the very least, have enough sense not to send you something that any rational person would see as hurtful. How did he expect you to react when you saw that? 

I would collect the presents, return them, spend the money elsewhere on yourself and make a point to not buy these people gifts again since they're so unappreciative. Next, you need to have a serious talk with your boyfriend. If you can't trust your partner to defend you when you're not around, you have a big issue."
