todayilearned,ffb5mw3,t1_ffb2lsq,1579752432.0,"The Seljuqs were a primary target of the first crusade, as one of its direct stated intention was to stop the looting and burning of churches in Anatolia by the Seljuq Turks. Either you have a very basic understanding of the history or a very skewed one. Based on your name I'm going to have to assume the latter. 

The conquests of Egypt, Palestine and North Africa were almost certainly attributable to economic reasons while the conquest of Hispaniola had many potential driving factors, not the least of which was the Umayyad failure to capture Constantinople and the natural human desire to conquer. The whole ""power burns a hole in your pocket"" thing. Besides, Spain was by no means Christianized at that point, being ruled by the Visigoths who were mostly pagan or Arianist with a Chalcedonian Christian minority. So even that wasn't a religious expansion beyond being justified by Umayyads as ""better to be under Islamic rule"" (which notably, unlike almost every christian conquest, didnt include the forced conversion of those conquered in Hispaniola).

The Muslims, like Christians, have experienced periods of conquest and expansion. Let's put it this way then, Islam never posed more of an existential threat to Christianity than Christianity did to Islam."
todayilearned,ffb5d6l,t1_ffb31n6,1579752228.0,"You may want to read up on the seljuq turks, and the range of the seljuq empire at the time of the first crusades. 

Short answer; because they could. To suggest it had anything to do with them being Muslim is absurd. Raiding and conquering were very different things. Just ask the vikings. The were great at one and not so great at the other."
todayilearned,ffb057g,t1_ffax8cj,1579748536.0,"Bullshit. They, particularly the Seljuq Turks, had beef with the Byazantines, sure, but they were hardly united by any means. The Seljuqs wanted Anatolia, which was land conquered from their ancestors hundreds of years previous by the Romans in the first place. In fact they were in the midst of a power vacuum when the first crusade was launched, hence why it was so successful. It was the Crusades themselves that served as the impetus for figures like Saladin to unite the squabbling Caliphates and pose a real threat to the west. Yet still Saladin never launched assaults west of Anatolia, in fact Saladin never even really went that far north of Aleppo in force. Why not, with the Muslim armies at his back and the Kingdom of Jerusalem vanquished and the crusader forces reeling, if this was the Muslim intention from the start? Because Europe was never the jewel, the Levant was. The bridge between east and west. Europe's gateway to the Silk Road.

Regardless of any of this, the Mongols would later arrive and beat the piss out of and subjugate everyone in the region (later leading to the rise of the Ottomans), and would make serious headway as far west as the kingdom of Moravia in central Europe. The only time the Muslims have ever posed a threat to the west is in the minds of scared old white men."

Don't fuck with me, I went to university for welding and metallurgy, lol"
todayilearned,ff8mdcq,t1_ff8it2z,1579685690.0,"The Japanese used asymmetric longbows called Yumi that are relatively weak by comparison to war bows of other cultures, with draw strengths of 30-50 lbs. They're beautiful and elegant and accurate but pretty ineffective as a war bow. The Japanese of the samurai age tended to resolve conflict, even militarily, by single combat. One of the main reasons that when the war-seasoned and battle-hardened Mongols arrived on their shores they got their asses handed to them.

The swords you're referring to are likely attributable to a single smith or smithy, and they're called the Ulfbehrt blades. The steel they were forged from however was likely not Scandinavian in origin, but metallurgical studies have strongly suggested the steel was sourced from Syria, making them Damascus or Wootz steel blades. This was possible due to the Vikings' far flung trade routes, traveling by rivers and bodies of water and portaging their boats between them. Genetic testing of northern Indian populations reveals shared genes between the Nordic Scandinavians and the native Indian population in the northern part of the India. The Vikings were by far the best traveled people of their time, and there's exotic swords, a whole ethnic group in India and Viking ruins in Newfoundland to prove it. 

On an interesting note, a culture that straddles the skill of Japanese smiths (because they were truly masters, practically making silk purses from sows ears), and the higher quality steels of Viking Age Scandinavia (these guys were working steels about 0.8-1% carbon; Japanese steel was historically  ~.5-.7%) are the Celts that were pattern welding as early as the 2nd century to increase the strength of their works and for decorative purposes. By the viking age, pattern welding was common across Celtic and Scandinavian Europe. There's also strong speculation that your Ulfbehrt blades were just extraordinary examples of Scandinavian metallurgy, combining high quality ore and revolutionary pattern welding techniques.

While katanas are ""more brittle"" than other blades, this was usually by design to retain an extremely sharp cutting edge. The thought that they are prone to snapping in half or are otherwise ineffective or defective is the result of push back against samurai culture in general in Japan, of which I believe Kurosawa has played a large (and ohh so beautiful) part. Yes, they have edges that are prone to chipping, as all finely edged weapons do, perhaps a bit more, but trained swordsmen do not block with the edge, and blocking is an afterthought to armor in a true melee (which Japanese warfare during the katanas true hay-day rarely devolved into).

While we in the west see samurai like the knights of Japan and ronin like wandering gunslingers of the old west, this is not the view of the Japanese public. Samurai were oppressors and are a symbol of nobility and classism."
todayilearned,ff8ktj5,t1_ff8ihxp,1579683307.0,"No, not like the Khans archers. Those are the absolute pinnacle of mounted combat. The Apache helicopters of the medieval battlefield. Samurais are more comparable to the mounted dragoons of colonial times. They used horses to get around, much less as actual mounted combatants. Mongols used horses like you or I use our legs or hands; they were extensions of the Mongol's body. Most people can't comprehend what a Mongol on horseback was capable of. Imagine an army of rodeo trick riders armed with bows twice as strong as English longbows and as accurate as your average soldier in WW1 was with a rifle. We're talking armies of dudes that conquered the world in mouse-skin clothes. Mice they shot with bows, often from horseback on the Steppes. Each man bringing with him not a single horse, but a pack or a herd of horses so as to always have a fresh mount. Mongols also didn't require a supply train in the traditional sense; their horses provided milk (as they rode mares almost exclusively) and blood, which they would mix with the mares milk to form a sort weird horse smoothie with lots of protein and nutrients. They were allegedly capable of milking and drawing blood from their mounts as they rode, allowing them to cover ludicrous distances without stopping.

Mongols failed at invading Japan because a) they were not a naval empire and b) were severely hampered by weather during both of their invasions. Rest assured if the Mongols possessed a naval genius of Jebe or Subutai's caliber the Japanese would have been swiftly subjugated by the Mongols. Before the massive naval disaster during the first invasion, the Japanese were getting their asses kicked."
