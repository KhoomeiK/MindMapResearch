books,ffgv8h6,t3_etfp3z,1579915917.0,11/22/63 is my favorite King book. The way he handled time travel was brilliant.
facepalm,ffaa5gy,t3_esdwta,1579730879.0,More amusing than facepalming.
atheism,ff46l7e,t3_ere8wh,1579556662.0,"Instead of the Ten Commandments, they should replace those silly placards with the seven deadly sins."
facepalm,fez29h7,t3_eqx8bv,1579453176.0,"This is the equivalent of ""I'm not racist, I have a black friend."""
unpopularopinion,feyzn78,t3_eqw7hu,1579452449.0,"If you believe that everything happens for a reason, then don't look both ways before crossing the street because if that bus is meant to hit you, it will."
AskReddit,feylmu5,t3_eqt3lg,1579447248.0,"My grandfather (born in 1911) used to leave the kitchen whenever the microwave was being used. He was worried that he would get cooked too. I finally convinced him to eat food cooked in it but he never got over his fear of getting irradiated. My grandmother, on the other hand, thought it was the greatest thing ever, even though he wouldn’t ever let her get one."

leanfire,fe7vy6l,t1_fe2qjyt,1578919807.0,A big part of the return of international stocks is based on currency fluctuations. Right now the dollar is very strong but that won't last forever. Keeping some of your money in an international stock fund is a good hedge against that possibility.
progressive,fdaiypc,t3_ekd1hn,1578246577.0,Except that LGBT persons have no protections.
atheism,fd5j076,t1_fd3xgyb,1578178115.0,"This is exactly what I do. Everyone who asks knows I'm an atheist but I still fast on Yom Kippur and avoid bread on Passover. I also light candles for Hanukah.  I do it for me, not for a higher power. I do it because my parents and my grandparents did it (and never forced it on me). It connects me to them. I don't belong to a temple but I don't mind going to celebrate weddings and bar mitzvahs. Come to think of it, my grandparents who escaped the pogroms in eastern Europe never mentioned god or faith. They just did these things because ""it's what you do"". I bet they were atheists too but didn't even realize it."
atheism,fcxiohy,t1_fcvlto3,1578063898.0,Right now a bunch of Christian extremists are running our country - so we have to acknowledge that in some ways they're smarter than us.
financialindependence,fcswrhr,t1_fcrb9ar,1577927072.0,"However, if you started in 2000 with $1M, saw the market crashing and decided to keep working, your portfolio, excluding new money, would only be worth about $600K in late 2002 and you probably would have waited until it came back in 2006 before deciding to retire."
TeslaLounge,fcj0cfy,t3_eh99pe,1577674131.0,It apparently can withstand a light saber.
atheism,fcg3anq,t1_fccxqzj,1577636114.0,"I don't think #3 is all that rare. Plenty of people keep their religious labels for convenience but are atheists. I was raised Jewish but the more I think about how I was raised, the more I think my parents and grandparents were actually atheists. They never talked about god or faith and while my grandparents followed the traditions pretty closely, it was more due to culture and peer pressure than anything else. If I take a survey, I'll still check off the ""Jewish"" box even though I'm a non-believer and mostly non-practicing."
atheism,fcfzey2,t1_fcdvsk7,1577635138.0,I'll just add that at 16 most of us were quite sure of a lot of things that we now know aren't true.
atheism,fcfxi5y,t1_fcfu9cx,1577634651.0,"Well, that would make you a deist!"
atheism,fcfwevl,t1_fcd64jd,1577634320.0,"I really like the comfortable sweater analogy. As a physician, I deal with grieving families and religion often gives them comfort among all the uncertainty of a dying relative. Who am I to say that they can't use whatever tools are available to them to deal with it?"
atheism,fcfu9pt,t1_fccsgvq,1577633814.0,"The fact that you posted your question here tells me you are not as insecure as you think, and that's a good thing."
atheism,fcfthft,t1_fcc3zl7,1577633589.0,"Conveniently, no one mentions that god gave that baby cancer."
atheism,fcfm2kl,t1_fcex9p3,1577631547.0,"As a non-practicing secular Jew with no particular belief in god, I can assure you that Christianity is constantly shoved down my throat. The way you throw out the terms ""feminist"" and 'homosexuals"" makes it sound like you don't approve. How are they shoving anything down your throat? I'd really like to know."
atheism,fc4zgtw,t1_fc4hq17,1577435316.0,"As a neonatologist who sees lots of births and asks lots of questions, I can confirm that “virgin” births are a dime a dozen."
