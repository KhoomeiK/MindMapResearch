My parents were kinda helicopter in the other way. I am 20 now and noved out due to university, but back when I was in school, they took every chance they could get to ruin my selfestime.

Good grades were scuffed off, however bad grades - oh boy, could I be ready for a fucking barage of shit.

I always had a rather problematic schoollife. I have been bullied since 2n grade (elementary school) untill 7th grade (grammarschool) were I totally shut myself in, my grades dropped and I put on weight because I had stopped to take care of my body (both of which they never missed to point out).
My parents never cared for my mental health and only wanted so save the happy family-image. I never felt at home with my parents and even now they belittle my achivements over my failures and constantly passivly tell me my brother is better then me.
