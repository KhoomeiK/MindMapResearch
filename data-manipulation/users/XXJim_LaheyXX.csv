vegancirclejerk,fendf9y,t1_fencp22,1579282307.0,"Beyond Meat’s existence has saved more animals than any of the companies you are advocating for but cannot name.

A company that produces sustainable alternatives to meat for the mass market is incredibly valuable.

I don’t think we can just wait around forever until a perfect option appears, I’m much more for making choices that create a more sustainable world today.

Let’s work towards the best options, sure, but to not do anything until we have everything is a recipe for failure.

These companies aren’t going anywhere and our economic system isn’t going to change dramatically overnight and pretending otherwise only prolongs animal suffering and environmental degradation.

But you do you, and maybe I’ll see you at the revolution someday."

I don’t have to adjust my setting because some weird inexplicable glitch is happening with my graphics card or sound card.

I can just install the game and play it and it works this way for years at a fraction of the cost and frustration of a PC. I can play it with friends easily. And most importantly, I can sit on my couch in front of my tv and play in comfort, instead of hunched over a desk like I spend the rest of my waking hours.

When PC gaming has an answer to the accessibility and comfort of console gaming, maybe I’ll be more interested. Maybe."

Switch,fdemce6,t1_fdejb4t,1578342058.0,"Videogamesnewyork is one of the coolest games stores I’ve ever seen.

Barcade is an arcade that serves a variety of beers and it’s a pretty good time. There is also 2bit arcade which is the same sort of setup albeit not quite as fun, spare maybe one or two really good machines. Lots of pinball if you’re into that, but there are probably better pinball places.

Strand is a must if you like books.

Forbidden Planet is a cool comic shop, midtown comics is also pretty good.

If you’re into toys/statues of movie/show/game/anime characters Bookoff in midtown is pretty cool. They also have an interesting selection of games, manga, and other things including imports.

The uncommons is a small but cool board game cafe.

Nitecap is a nice but expensive bar. Welcome to the Johnsons is a grungy spot with cheap drinks.

The TKTS booths are the best way to get affordable show tickets."

The employees seem genuinely happy there too which is cool, totally different vibe than gamestop.
