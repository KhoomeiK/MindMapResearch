SavageGarden,fdlnfvs,t1_fdldi72,1578527998.0,"If you have a South facing window it’ll appreciate that more. VFTs are outside plants, the more direct sun the better for the plant. I had mine sitting in direct sunlight on a sunny porch. As soon as the sun got over the top of the neighbors house it had all the sun it wanted until the sun went down behind the other neighbors trees. Keep it under the grow light and natural sunlight as best as you can and keep an eye out for.. rubbery/plasticy/wrinkly/elongated leaves.. that means it needs more light and or stronger light

VFTs grow in swampy marshes so they like it *wet*. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being cactus, they like it at a 10. You can use the gimmicky cup but just be careful the water doesn’t sit for too long cause it can get algae in it which is not pretty or fun. Make sure that the water you use is distilled or rainwater. Tap water has chlorine and other particulates in it, which can harm the plant which likes clean water.

Make sure you don’t play with the traps, it’s so fun to watch them close, but the traps are only good for so many closes before they turn black and wilt away. New ones will replace those, but it still takes a lot of energy... Speaking of energy, making flowers at this young of an age is bad, if you see a flower stalk  you can cut it off to protect the plant (make sure it’s not a trap though cause cutting those off is no bueno). If you have a flower stalk reevaluate everything, a flower stalk means it’s really stressed out and it needs something in its life changed

If you decide to repot the lil baby make sure you use unfertilized peat moss. Regular potting soil has fertilizers in it which will kill it. The reason why it traps bugs is for those nutrients..
