television,ffdtdjd,t1_ffdt0wx,1579828446.0,I'm pretty sure almost the entire increase in scripted shows is due to the growth of streaming channels.  I haven't seen a lot of channels increase the total number of hours of scripted shows all that much.  I do see big increases of reality shows though.

It's the same reason you burn 2000 or whatever calories per day, even while lying down or sitting down.

television,ffdpqui,t3_et1van,1579826030.0,"A couple of things.  Channel groups like Viacom and A&E Network and the like continue to jack up their fees while reducing cost of programming through more reality shows and reruns on their individual channels.  Channels are becoming more homogenized and less distinct like Music Television only or History only or Movie classic only channels so there is less reason to get 1000 different channels, since they look more and more the same.  Also, prices for the cable bundles keep climbing.

So you can either play the game of threatening to cancel every year or 2 when your intro package is up to get reasonable cable rates all while getting worse programming, or you can go through with your threat and cut the cable.  If you don't watch Sports, it becomes a pretty easy decision.  Continuing with the hassle of 1 and 2 year contracts to pay more and more for less and less is absurd."

Diablo,ffcql7v,t1_ffcqdqa,1579805174.0,"There is gear inflation, but not nearly as much as D3.  Since Season 1 D3 gear inflation has increased damage over a million fold (from top GRs around 50 to top GRs around 150).   

The fact that there is gear inflation in PoE doesn't change the fact that PoE has an evolving endgame and more things to do at endgame than the same old rifts you leveled up on and then GRs that only look a little different.  Also, your gearing continues to evolve through the life of your character if you know what you are doing.  It's not uncommon to get a dramatic upgrade even at level 98 or 99.

D3 really doesn't change much from day 1 of the season if you play a lot.  You get to a relatively static position and the biggest thing that changes is the +5 mainstat from Paragons and Augments."

Let's face it, you have your build filled out and you may be GR100 by the first day, or at least the first weekend.  After that it becomes kind of a treadmill.

explainlikeimfive,ffc2dme,t3_estocu,1579789812.0,"Essentially the US only has to pay back debt when people are no longer willing to lend money to the US, and the Fed buying debt instead of other people would cause too much inflation.  The way it works is that the Treasury Issues bonds with a duration on them, the most common issue is 10 years, but they can issue instruments with shorter or longer duration.  So for a 10 year bond, you lend them, say, 10,000, and over 10 years you get your 10,000 back plus interest, but you can't demand payment before your scheduled payment.  

When Bonds become due, the Treasury can always issue new bonds to pay for the old ones.

If no one were to buy bonds, the Federal Reserve Bank could always buy bonds, but that would tend to devalue currency.  However, currency prices are also set by supply/demand, so it may or may not devalue the currency.

In a real sense, it's not all that important for the government to pay debt to zero, what it should do is try to get the Debt/GDP (you can think of this as national income) percentage to a reasonable value.  The higher the Debt/GDP, the slower a countries economic growth seems to be."
television,ffc0rbe,t3_essr1p,1579788593.0,"Honestly it makes sense to me, especially old shows that had a lot of filler in their 26 episode seasons.  I already fast forward through some shows when the ""B"" or ""C"" story involves some minor characters that I don't care about or dislike.  To me it looks like some of those stories are added just to kill time in an episode to hit commercial breaks on time.  Also, if there is a montage used for the same reason I usually FF through it.  Essentially, shows made for commercial TV often have a lot of filler which is mostly used because it is easily manipulated to hit the breaks on time, and I'd just as soon FF through the filler.  Also, in a lot of shows they have scenes that just belabor the obvious or are acting out some tired trope, or they are running through the 9,643,346 car chase scene since Bullitt, which I'm happy to x2 past.

Diablo,ffbz1eu,t1_ffbxb3m,1579787241.0,"A) You didn't get your do over in Act 1 until fairly late in the D2 life, something like 2010.

B) Once you know a few basic things about character building, it really isn't tough to go without a guide.  However, for rookies a build guide is a very good idea.  For most rookies who don't want to follow a build guide, I'd suggest targeting 150-200% additional life nodes on the tree while leveling, and keeping your elemental resists capped, because getting things like an energy shield build is much easier to do in maps.  Your armor/evasion really isn't a big deal until maps either.

C) When it comes to resistance, at Act 6 you need 75% cap plus 30% penalty, or 105% resists for 3 elements.  That's 315% elemental resist. You should be able to craft +25% or so resist to your gear after act 4, and you have 9-10 slots you can craft, which is 225-250% resists.  That leaves you with less than 100% elemental resist you need to find on gear.  It really isn't that tough. If you can't get that plus reasonable life plus sockets, which is all you need until maps, you're doing something wrong with your loot filter.

D) until you know what you are doing, you should probably prioritize defense over offense, if nothing else you can stay alive longer while figuring out whatever mechanics you can figure out."
Diablo,ffbwkxa,t1_ffbudki,1579785146.0,"By Act 6 you should have crafting going, and the ability to craft resistances means that getting resist cap even with the penalty isn't particularly difficult.

He was banned from twitch.  You're just too fucking stupid to know the difference, because you literally have a river of shit flowing between your ears."
Diablo,ff0uau3,t1_ff0u4t4,1579472381.0,lol.  That's pretty hilarious unless it's a metric shit ton of bounty mats.
Diablo,ff0ty8k,t1_ff0s832,1579472277.0,So he doesn't drop anything worthwhile and no achievement or anything?
Diablo,ff0tt9g,t1_ff0s45h,1579472233.0,"He's clearly still on the leaderboard, and he left the game like a week before the emergency patch and bans came out you slimy, lying toad."
Diablo,ff0r61f,t1_fes9ezq,1579471521.0,"No, they didn't, and he is in fact still on the leaderboards."
Diablo,ff0qhic,t1_ff0jzzm,1579471377.0,"He's still on the leaderboards at number 92, dumbass.  He just quit D3 because there comes a point that playing D3 is boring as hell, and he had hit it for the season."
Diablo,ff0pm79,t1_ff0jzzm,1579471090.0,"What was he banned for?  I know he quit playing D3 on stream like a week before the Pandemonium exploit bug and well before the leaderboard ban.  Hell, he quit the D3 league something like the first week of December.

The only thing I know he got banned was like a one day or two day ban on Twitch, not D3."
Diablo,ff0jt5e,t1_ff0isve,1579469503.0,"Dude, everyone is streaming PoE instead of D3 now because that's where the viewers are.  That includes Quin, DatModz, Lord_Fluffy, Alkaizer ...

The D3 season brings viewers for a week or 2, and then if you are an ARPG streamer you switch to PoE as soon as there is a new PoE league.  PoE brings in better numbers for most streamers outside the first week of D3 league launch."

Personally, I think it's a little bit funny and a little bit sad how delusional he is."
Diablo,ff0eoil,t3_eqg0ax,1579468189.0,"I don't think they can ban on consoles at all, and quite frankly, I don't think they have a way to 100% tell if someone is cheating.  I'd be surprised if they have a way of dealing with cheaters with 100% accuracy in D4."
Diablo,ff0e7s8,t1_fes9ezq,1579468030.0,"The only time I recall Alkaizer getting a ban was for using the name MunzoverFunz.  Seems a pretty absurd thing to do,

I do remember Chainer getting banned for blatantly botting tho."

Diablo,ff0bdku,t1_fetyij3,1579467192.0,Funny how other games with trading have much better drop rates.
science,ff09prq,t1_fezk5ke,1579466658.0,"It's pretty clear after talking to women who have had the procedure that the whole ""life ruined by regret"" scenario has always been wishful thinking by the religious right.  Most women I've talked to are happy they didn't destroy their lives with a pregnancy at a time when it would have wrecked their future.

Unfortunately, in our society you can see many people who entered a cycle of poverty and despair by having a baby too young or even having a baby an putting it up for adoption.  Our society really doesn't have the type of social safety net to put people in those positions."
Christianity,ff08gnm,t1_ff07i8a,1579466275.0,"You were the one trying to make it a single party issue.  I just think its hilarious that weak minded individuals wring their hands about the deficit when Dems are in charge, but when their GOP is in charge, they never seem to notice that in fact GOP Presidents routinely increase the Deficit more than Dems and create investment bubbles that destroy the economy when they pop more than Dems.  

When the current bubble pops, it will be much worse than Bush's '08 disaster."
Diablo,ff06ta4,t3_eqiu3m,1579465781.0,"I've always believed the real problems were the itemization being so bad that you were pretty much forced to go to the AH to progress.  Games like D1 and D2 and PoE you can play Solo Self Found and completely avoid trading and the auction house, and still have an enjoyable time, and you don't really hit the wall if you know what you are doing.

In D3, unless you were exploiting, that really wasn't possible.  You'd hit a wall where the items that were dropping were lower level than the mobs you were fighting, and most of your drops would be trash anyway, like Strength Bows.  Additionally, Legendaries were all pretty much garbage, and the only Legendaries people really wanted were stat sticks, like Mempo of twilight which allowed more IAS.

I think the AH took the fall for incompetently designed itemization in D3."
