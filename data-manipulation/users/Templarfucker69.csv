antiMLM,ffgl6se,t3_etg8tm,1579908788.0,"Reminds me of student works. They almost had me hook, line, and sinker cause they said it would be a summer job. I thought it might be good on a resume but I don’t have a car, so I had to back out. So glad I did."

Showerthoughts,ffclrzw,t1_ffca5a2,1579802163.0,True. I feel like all it does is prove how bad they are at their job if everyone fails like that.

AskReddit,fectcso,t3_eo9dmg,1578983837.0,... I think we all know.
AskReddit,fecq2b7,t1_fecowj6,1578980500.0,"I had this treatment done to help cope with trauma. Unsure if it was that specifically that helped, or if it was a combination of that and the support system I have, along with my therapist helping to support me every step of the way... all I know is that I’m much better now. I don’t get near panic attacks from thinking about what happened. When I remember it, it’s just a passing thought. So I guess you could say it was effective?"
curlyhair,fecky1z,t1_fecafp0,1578976459.0,"Oh that’s rough. Comments like that can be pretty hurtful. I dealt with the same sort of thing growing up, but not from my family. I’m glad you have taken your own hair journey into your own hands! Let those curls run WILD!"
curlyhair,feckqzh,t1_fe9vwv2,1578976314.0,"Ooof. That’s... pretty upsetting, I’ll admit. I hope they ask about whatever you’re doing right now instead of your appearance. Though I’m sure both your hair and the work you’re doing is wonderful. Keep doing what you’re doing"
curlyhair,feckgkd,t1_fe88r0h,1578976103.0,"Thats a good comeback! If someone’s being rude about it, I’ll try saying that. 

Omg that reminds me. One time, I was waiting for my friend after school so we could walk together. Spent like 10 minutes reading my book before I finally decided to look up. She had been sitting right next to me the entire time, just didn’t recognize me because my hair had been straightened.  Wild."
curlyhair,fecjsft,t1_fe80tzc,1578975627.0,"Oh word. My hair used to be nothing but frizz with slight waves. I treated it like it was straight, so my hair was very angry at me. Now after years of learning what my hair needs, my curls are really coming through. I’m glad your mom is coming around to your curls! :)"
