As I described in another comment, it might be the better solution to simply let those conspiracy panic-heads run wild freely thus people become more sensitive and attentive to the issue than to actually to try to calm people with a currently rational and realistic position."
worldnews,ffmcn0e,t1_ffmarp3,1580052424.0,"That is a neuraminidase inhibitor which like a vaccination can only work to specific mutations. It can contain an infection with reducing the viral load by inhibiting the virions (basically viral cells) to dock on healthy cells with basically filling those docking ports. 

Imagine a big ball with hands around it which grab everything they can. Now Tamiflu is a carpet bomb of baseballs. These baseballs end up in the hands and thus the hands can't grab anything else anymore. Though, what is if you don't have enough baseballs? What is if the hands don't react to the baseballs? What is if the hands learn to let go?

And that is why neuraminidase inhibitors can just reduce the viral load and depending on the virus mutation, might do that more or less or not at all.

So, it is not quite an anti-viral med. I mean it is, but it also is not like people understand it. Also it is extremely debated right now as it seem to have some long-term sideffects [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4375804/)

&nbsp;

> but that can only go so far. Common cold has a much, much lower mortality rate, and I'm vaccinated against the flu. There is no vaccine for Coronavirus yet.

As a side-note, you should realize that you are not vaccinated against the flu, you are bestowed with a limited spectrum of antibodies for a limited spectrum of influenza-based mutations. That is far from ""all there is"". You can entirely catch a flu like everyone else as the flu mutates way faster than any vaccination can be loaded with. That is the reason why the flu exists.

The flu vaccination is kind of an epidemic prevention method as the flu is mutating so quickly, reducing the stems means reducing the rate of infection, but you are not magically protected to it as that is not how our biology works.

&nbsp;

>I don't understand how the fact it's lingering long without symptoms is irrelevant for those with suppressed immune systems.

Because one has to assume that someone who knows one is in the risk group should be way more careful, hence also take precautions. Including letting your immediate social environment know to be careful around you.

Those who get infected are simply infected because they lack that caution an especially higher attention like you should apply. It's not a kind of superman virus which requires a single gem to hit somewhere and bamm infected."

You know flu shots only offer antibodies to a range of mutations, yet there are way more mutations than what you get vaccinated for that's why you usually still can get the flu, which is also nothing utterly bad unless you are immune suppressed.

As of now, if you are infected by a virus, you have your body to come up with a method to fight it and all you do is support that system."

worldnews,ffm4ooa,t1_ffm45c7,1580048482.0,"It's still entirely unnecessary to get infected (it's really not nice to be mentally struck for 2 weeks for nobody), hence I agree to the end that people should simply become more sensitive and sensible with spreading germs.

I get your point, as of now it seems that the issue is that the incubation period is so long that people infect others due to a lack of attention as there are simply no symptoms.

You know, if you got no symptoms a lot of people simply are not concerned and have a generally bad or minimal attention span to not spread germs. This stem seems to take a lot of time to actually have a human body to react to it and thus people spread it more effectively. 

So, it may not even be more infectious, it's just that it lingers for so long.

So, at one end I'd say let the conspiracy panic maker spread their thing as it at least leads to people be more attentive in general, at the other end I just have an intellectual issue with people spreading panic-driven  misinformation.

If that spread out quickly due to some circumstances like Chinese New Years which is a weeks long festive time, you gotta increase that isolation radius.

This mutation is easy to transmit, but is not as taxing to the body as SARS was and is. It's quite comparable to the influenza stem, spreading easily just dangerous to those who are in condition of suppressed immune activity."

Especially waking up and immediately leaving the room in a hurry is easy to be interpreted as a hasting activity, means flight. To realize if there is danger, the dog follows you. Over time a dog will get used to this pattern and know ""ahh nothing bad, she just doing her thing"".

memes,ffbzm2p,t1_ffbjtuo,1579787693.0,"> The moment you stop giving a flying fuck about what women think about you, it's the moment you become much more focused and attractive to them.

That's a general misconception, based in selective and biased perception. And also it is a typical spread romantic idealist phrase. It's not grounded in reality. 

You don't. You are just not as annoying to women anymore as before you may have tried to read all kinds of signals into all kinds of little things like smiles and politeness. Most people can't handle that constant analysis expression well and leak it to the outside looking tensed, which attractive women can read easily as they are exposed to it soooooooo often. I had so many women explaining me the very same thing over and over again and that is why they start to become more defensive as that is the easy way to handle men they are not interested in. 

Men usually make the mistake to interpret the sudden openeness of women when they don't signal that constant search for cues anymore. But that is again not a sign of being more attractive to women, it's just them not being annoyed anymore as before the same guy tried to see interest signals in every little hint, and thus the women are more relaxed in the interaction, becoming more open. 

That though, doesn't mean you are more attractive suddenly. It's just a mistaken perception disparity as men like to tend to ""think"" they have chances with women they are signalling indifference to and may be not interested in. But alas you get a date, you should rather assume it's just women more relaxed in your environment and that is not attractiveness."

Also agree with, it's just soooo annoying to always read this negative painting of someone else. We didn't have that in the early 2000s and we had as active forums, IRC and direct messenger culture. We didn't came up with those things to blame our parents for anything, we just saw issues and either acted or didn't.

A story is complete if a story has an end. If that is a bad story, got plot-holes and an open-end doesn't mean it is not finished. An open-end is a totally legit rhetorical device, used all the time.
