WatchPeopleDieInside,ffqarmo,t1_ffq2als,1580128524.0,Same. I used to watch football and now stopped. I'm sick of matches being decided on professional flopping. Clear and fragrant flopping should banned for the remainder of whichever league's current season.

Leaving my sister and I at a drug dealer's house because my mother couldn't pay at the moment? Not good enough. It took us being shot at, myself hurting the shooter as a 7'sh year old, and my mother arrested for multiple felonies for the judge to even consider letting us stay with our father."
