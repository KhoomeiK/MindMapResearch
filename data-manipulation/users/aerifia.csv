bulletjournal,fgqgli8,t3_ezz887,1581023787.0,"I’d never made a skincare tracker or anything like this before, but decided to do it now since I’ve been playing around with my routine a bit and was getting overwhelmed by trying to track it in my head. Feel free to use as inspiration (or just straight up copy) if you think it could help you!"
Libraries,fg2h7gy,t3_ewil91,1580444943.0,"At my library, they usually purposefully mess up a shelf and have you put everything in the right place, or like you said, give you some books to put away. It’s probably not a pen-and-paper test, so I wouldn’t worry about it too much!"
trichotillomania,ffj80zo,t3_etsqau,1579992679.0,It looks so good and you’re so pretty!!
bujo,ffix8cl,t3_etv6fn,1579984932.0,"Did you get the journal from amazon? The quality seems to have gone down over the past few years, and many (including me) experience pretty major ghosting with any pen or marker. I would change the journal if that’s a possibility for you. I know a lot of people use Archer and Olive and say they’re really good, with minimal ghosting. Scribbles that matter is also good from what I’ve heard."
