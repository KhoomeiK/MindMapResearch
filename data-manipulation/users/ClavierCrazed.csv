As for safety, had it been a huge issue, we would’ve talked about it more.
I told them to never touch someone who didn’t want to be touched and to get away if someone tried to touch them inappropriately. They knew to tell me immediately if someone touched them.

Students also went through a program at school that addressed molestation and abduction.

You have to keep in mind that my kids were of “sex talk” age more than 20 years ago in a very small close-knit community.  Their environment was probably much different than yours.

Also, I think that when kids are exposed to too much sex talk at home, they become precocious and are more likely to become sexually active too soon and, possibly, promiscuous.. 

The girls I went to school with whose parents talked openly about sex were the ones to have more of an interest in sex. Most of them had a trashy way of speaking. They focused more on relationships and sex than goals, studies, interests. 

That was my experience. I’m not saying that all kids whose parents are open about sex never succeed in school. I’m suggesting that overly emphasizing sex at home might be distracting."

There are men who approach for sex and men who approach for a relationship that includes sex. I’m old enough and wise enough to know the difference. Most of the men I meet are looking for long-term commitment and expect it far too soon.

This may seem like a strange concept to you. However, it is real.

One of the most common complaints from women is that men are hard to talk with. They generally do not listen attentively enough to hear and understand what we’re saying. Many men do not think that it’s necessary to understand.

My theory is that rushing relationships is a result of the sexual revolution and our society becoming an immediate gratification society, possibly influence by a disposable society.

Before the sexual revolution that began in the 1960’s, dating was far different. There was no online dating, of course. In the 1950’s and before,couples were familiar with each other before their first date because they met at school, church, work.

take their daughter on a date. The daughter needed her parents’ approval before she could go.

Dates were commonly chaperoned to prevent physical contact, either mutual or forced. Another common practice was double-dating, meaning that two couples went on the same date. 

There was no ‘hanging out’ at one of the others’ homes. Dates included activities such as bowling, movies, dances, a light meal or ice cream. The boy, who paid for the date, returned the girl to her parents according to a curfew established by her parents. 

After several dates or months of dating, the boy asked the girl to be exclusive. If she agreed, they continued on without sexual contact. After a year or two, the boy asked the girl for marriage, usually asking her father’s permission beforehand.if she said yes, they set date for the wedding several months to a year or more of which the bride-to-be planned with her mother.

The couple were sometimes allowed time .alone. But, traditionally,they did not have sex until after their wedding.

She said that she was breaking up because of poor communication. This is the number one reason that relationships fail. Please take it seriously because, if you don’t, your future relationships will suffer and you will likely end up feeling as you do now.  

23 years ago, after a divorce, I realized that my communication skills were, in part, the reason our 10-year relationship/marriage was troubled and ended. To learn to be a quality partner and prevent heartbreak from happening again, I underwent therapy, read numerous books on the subject of communication, watched instructional videos, journaled, practiced. I urge you to do the same. 

My communication skills have improved extensively. Yours will, too, when you put in the time and effort. 

Advice on how to move on emotionally after your break up:

1. Make a conscious decision to get over your feelings for your ex.
Do not allow your feeling to control you. Control your feelings.

2. For  your own sake, do not base the outcome of future relationships on the outcome of one relationship. Live in the moment. Listen attentively to new women who enter your life. Appreciate the time they spent with you. Have fun.

3. No relationship comes with a guarantee that it will last. Focus on quality time together, not longevity of the relationship. Be careful to not sabotage your relationships by focusing on longevity. The more you worry about it, the less focus you have for the actual relationship. The relationship will be unfulfilling and likely not end well.

4. Break-ups do not mean failure. They do not necessarily mean that one or the other partner wronged the other. 
If a woman breaks up with you, it doesn’t mean she intentionally tried to hurt you. It doesn’t mean she’s evil. It doesn’t mean that she finds you undesirable.
There could be many personal reasons for breaking up that have little or nothing to do with you. 

5. She you free to find a woman who will be happy with you and you with her. 
Remaining hurt, angry, distrustful, and bitter with all women after a break-up, will sabotage future relationships.
Instead, look forward to meeting someone new to enjoy time together. When you DELIBERATELY open your heart and mind, you will be more likely to love again.

6. Don’t seek the same feelings you had with your ex. You will likely never find it again because women are unique, therefore your feelings will be unique. Look for admirable and trustworthy qualities rather than focus on feelings. 

7. Distract yourself when you think of her. Avoid places you went together, Find a new hobby, watch a movie out of your normal genre, take a hike in places you did not go with, listen to new music, GET NEW BEDDING to prevent being reminded of her at night, take down pictures of her, remove all of her personal items from your dwelling.

The point isn’t to completely forget her. You never will. The point is to not be reminded during the stage you’re in because thinking of her extensively holds you back from moving to the next stage.

When you’re stronger, you’ll be able to go back to those places, watch those music, listen to the music you shared, etc.


8. Do something you’ve always wanted to do, something that will raise your self esteem. Don’t wait until you feel good. Make yourself do it. Celebrate your accomplishment.
 
9. Seek medical treatment for your depression immediately.

10. Keep reminding yourself that better days are ahead of you and keep moving towards them.

11. Do not retaliate. Focus on healing yourself rather than hurting her. Acts that will inhibit you from moving ahead:

Attempting to destroy her reputation, blaming her, withholding and/or damaging her personal property, self/harm with the hope that she’ll feel guilty, persuading mutual friends to side with you, contacting her after she’s said “no contact.

I’ve only touched on a few of the many steps you can take to overcome a break up. I urge you to seek many other sources such as books, articles, pod casts,YouTube videos.
Be cautious of talking with men who are bitter towards their exes even if you think they are justified. They likely will not offer you healthy advice or accurate insight.

Good luck to you!"

Think through the costs in regulating child birth. What you propose would be a huge financial burden on our government. 

-Extra law enforcement, investigators, courts, support staff, transportation.

-Funds for office buildings; salaries of social workers, administrators, record-keepers, janitors; postage, office supplies, computers, phones, etc; court costs when parents sue. 

What happens to parents who have incomes above the minimum to qualify for having children, yet do not take care of the properly? They should also be fined, don’t you think? 

They’d still have children who aren’t cared for. That would be unfair to lower income people who do not qualify and did not break the law by having a child. A great deal of animosity would occur between social classes resulting in violence and other criminal activity.

Signs of romantic feelings:
She smiles, giggles, plays with her hair while you’re talking, her eyes sparkle a little when your eyes meet, moves close to you and, especially speaking to you kindly with a warm or excited tone of voice.
 
Those are signs from a normal teen age girl.  Being as I don’t know her personality or much about her at all, I can’t be sure that she’d show those signs.

If she sounds harsh, she might be interested in you romantically, but, not really like you as a person. That’s the type of girl to avoid.

My advice:
Keep talking and spending time together as-long-as she responds well. Being as you’re uncomfortable with a kiss at this point, show her other signs of affection such as casually holding her hand, touching her arm or lower part of her back lightly, putting your arm around her lightly. 

Start out slow. Do not grab her hand and clutch it throughout the entire date. Lightly hold it for several minutes at a time while talking, working up to longer durations. It’s okay to hold it for longer while you’re walking or watching a show. 

Take the same approach with putting your arm around her.
See how she responds. If she seems comfortable with affection, she has feelings. Your affection will cause her feelings to grow.

You probably don’t because you believe that would be a violation of a human right to choose to give birth or choose to not give birth. Correct?

The same applies to your idea that 13-year-old should be sterilized (is that what you meant?) until they’re financially responsible. Their right to choose would be violated.
 
Besides, it’s a downright creepy idea to live in a country where the government tells you when you can bare children.

Would this regulation only apply to girls? What about boys? Shouldn’t they also be at risk for complications from the method of birth control? Why would the responsibility and risks only be placed in girls, if that’s what you’re proposing?

I don’t think you’ve thought through the burden such a regulation would place on our government. An entire agency would have to be created including numerous employers, staff, doctors. The cost would take a huge chunk out of the national budget.

Who would pay for the birth control, monitoring the recipient’s health, the reversal procedure, and other medical attention? 

The cost to the government might be as much, if not more, than what would be paid for children born to parents receiving government healthcare, cash benefits, housing, and food assistance.

She hangs out with you, seems to like you, yet told you she’s dating someone else just as you were about to ask her out.

Proceed with caution because you don’t want to scare her away, right? You want to respect the respect her new relationship, too?
My advice: 
Hang back slightly in your interactions with her. Still be friendly, but,  with a little distance. Wait for a couple of weeks to see what happens. If she mentions her new boyfriend or asks why you’re being distant, casually mention that you’d like to take her out if things don’t work out with her new guy. Tell her, “Let me know”, then drop the subject, then continue on as you were somewhat distant. If she shows more interest in you after that, remind her to let you know if she’d like to go out. If she shows less interest, become even a little more distant.
Be patient with the process. Be cool and genuinely polite. It might seem like a back and forth game for a while, which indicates she’s in the process of making a decision about you. 
I can’t tell you the outcome. She might eventually come to you and say she’d like to go out. Or her interest in you might gradually decrease until it’s apparent she’s not interested. Or you might gradually lose romantic interest in her. Be patient with the process. 
Don’t be angry or rude because there may come a time when she sees you in a different light and/or is ready for what you have to offer her.

unpopularopinion,fcqpdf2,t1_fcqfth6,1577890010.0,"Well, I never saw my kids put their toys between their legs or masturbate in anyway. Maybe your kids are sexual. Mine weren’t. Not all kids have the same physiology.
Accuse me of not paying attention? I was a stay-at-home mom. My main purpose was to take care of my kids, stay abreast of pertinent issues, and deal with them as they came along. 
Masturbation wasn’t an issue. Once they went through puberty I’m sure they figured it out on their own. WTF would I have told them? They would have been embarrassed. 
Some things are meant to be private. That’s how I roll.
What did you tell your kids about masturbation? How did that information affect them?
My kids’ well-being was my number one priority. 
You assume that, because I didn’t tell them where babies came from, I didn’t protect them from predators?
None of them were molested. I would’ve known. My eyes were open and I constantly monitored who they spent time with. They knew that if ANYONE said “don’t tell your parents” or threatened them, they were to tell me immediately.
When my daughter was a pre-teen, I asked her how she felt about talking to strangers online. Her response: “Why would I want to talk to strangers online?” 
You see, I showed faith in my kids’ intelligence. I protected my kids by paying attention and spending time with them. They had friends, activities and interests. Our community was protective of all children, not just their own. We were on high alert for molesters and abusers.
If I sensed something wasn’t right about an adult, I didn’t allow my kids to be alone with them.
I also allowed my kids to use their instincts. If they didn’t feel comfortable with an adult, I supported them in staying distant from them. 
My second son was pushed into a chair by the school principal when he was in fourth grade. He insisted on calling me. He told me to pick him up, then told me what happened. I called the superintendent immediately, then called the police. 
The principal was made to seek therapy and ordered by the superintendent and myself to stay away from my son.
That was the only incident of abuse to any of my children by an adult. He knew to call me and get out of the situation. He knew he could talk to me and I’d be there for him. 
About the little girl who nearly molested my five-year-old son, you knew her and her family based on two sentences of information?
Yes, I’m glad that my five-year-old son was innocent. I watched them closely after that incident. And I mentioned that he was too young to be married and have babies.
What would you have done? Would you have let the little girl continue?
You know, children molesting another child is a thing that parents should be concerned about.
When I was in fourth grade, a gang of boys ripped the clothes off of a girl in the playground while other students observed. I don’t know what or even if the incident was of concern to her parents, teachers, school admin. I didn’t witness it and didn’t hear of it until I was in my forties when my then husband told me he saw it happen after I told him that one of the boys involved molested me on a school bus when I was 13.
I told my boys at a very young age that when a girl says “no”, get away from her immediately. I didn’t go into details about what circumstances, I told them very firmly that “no” means “no”. 
In college, my oldest son rescued a girl at a party from being gang-raped. I tend to think that my “no means no” played a part in that.

My kids always knew that they could talk to me if they wanted. They’re grown adults now and all of them would tell you that.
They were smart kids. But, really, how smart does a kid have to be to figure out where babies come from? You’re sounding as if, because I didn’t directly tell them that sex creates babies, I totally isolated them.
We lived in a tight-knit community.They were surrounded by families and pregnant women. They watched television and read constantly.
I didn’t think it was necessary. They made it through their teens and young adult lives without any consequences such as unwanted pregnancy. 
If they felt I wronged them, they would have told me. 
Their dad and I were divorced. Maybe he had “the talk” with them. I doubt it, though. Like me, he doesn’t have to know every detail of our kids’ lives. He doesn’t involve himself in every aspect.

I personally am disappointed with Bruce Jenner. He was a national hero when I was young. He was a young man who accomplished an amazing feat. A man. I new him as a man for nearly forty years. I still haven’t adjusted to his gender change. It confuses me because, when I see pictures of him, I see a man dressed like a woman. Not that I think he’s wrong for doing so, seeing him as Caitlin plays with my mind.
I shouldn’t be disappointed, but, I am. I want him to be Bruce Jenner, the Olympic decathlon winner, not Caitlin who I used to know as a man, now dressed like a woman with unnatural female organs.
It’s selfish of me, I know. 
I try to be happy for him. But, my feelings always return to disappointment."
unpopularopinion,fcp3dby,t1_fcn2pg9,1577849223.0,"Females as more natural caregivers is not a myth.
I’m not saying that men cannot be good caregivers. I’m saying that it comes to mothers naturally. Do fathers carry children for 9 months? No. Do fathers give birth? No. Do fathers breast feed? Of course not. Their only necessary function by nature was to impregnate the mother, provided she was able to find nourishment on her own in order to give birth to a live infant.
Once the infant is born, it is possible for the mother to care for the child without the father, as I mentioned before, if she’s able to find food to nourish her body to produce milk for the infant.
By nature, fathers are providers that are designed to find food and bring it to the mother. But, the mother would be able to keep the child alive until it was old enough to find food on its own without the presence or assistance of the father.
I anticipate men being offended by that last statement, although it is absolutely true. 
You see, men are not natural caregivers and nurturers of children.
However, fathers are able to LEARN caregiving and nurturing with the aid of bottles and formula or milk to feed the child. 
They might fumble a bit. But, they can adequately keep a child alive.
Before bottles, formula, and expressing milk from animals, young infants did not survive without their mother unless their was a surrogate to nurse the infant.

I’m not writing this to insult fathers. I simply want to clarify that their caregiving and nurturing are LEARNED skills, not natural skills.
That’s likely the reason that it surprises many people to see a man caring for an infant without the mother nearby.
We’re evolving. We can’t expect what’s unnatural to be completely accepted, especially when only 50 years ago it was extremely rare for a father to feed and diaper their child."

That’s the way discussions between conservatives and liberals usually go, this the reason we don’t talk with them.

I felt instant relief.

It went far more smoothly than I expected."

Issues between men and women are an overwhelming mess in our society. There are so many misconceptions. 
Based mostly what I’ve read and heard on social media over the past several years, men have far more misconceptions about women than women do about men. Misogyny is pervasive and more extreme than ever. Women have been demonized. It’s a serious problem. Men are frustrated, scared, and failing at relationships because of the sexism men have created.

I’ve been concerned since I started online dating in 2003. It became obvious after talking to many men, reading their profiles, seeing thousands of single men on a each dating site that there was a prevalent problem. 
I soon discovered that men were generally distrustful, angry, frustrated with women based on their own misconceptions, stereotypes, their unwillingness to understand, communication problems, self-entitlement and a myriad of other male-induced problems. 
I’m not saying that women are never at fault. I’m saying that the differences between men and women usually are caused by men.
I know that my opinion is not PC. 
Do you know about MGTOW? Check it out on YouTube if you haven’t already. It is a movement originally started to help men with legal and financial issues after divorce, which was a good thing. Over the past decade, it’s grown to include 100’s of thousands of men. The original purpose has been lost. It’s horrifically toxic for women and the men who follow the movement. Watch a few videos if you haven’t already. It’s shocking and frightening.
Because of what I heard on a MGTOW video in which horrible things were said about ALL single mothers, I did a YouTube search “bad single mothers”. There were 1000’s if videos. I then searched “bad single fathers”. There were far less, maybe less than 100.
Yes, we have big troubles and I don’t know where to begin in finding solutions. Most men will not hear reason.They do not realize how much they’re hurting themselves, their families, and society in general.
I’m unsure if most of them even care as hate seems to be more acceptable than understanding."
unpopularopinion,fcolxoy,t3_ei66s1,1577835547.0,"Perhaps, that’s because of your approach, such as in your remark about hate.
More-than-likely they simply do not agree with your view point or you have evaded giving support for your claim/view point.
It’s annoying and a time waster.
The best think to do in Reddit, if you really want a discussion, is to make a statement, then offer your the reasons you believe that statement. Offer examples, analogies, sources, and concepts that support your statement. 
If you don’t have any of those, it’s best not to post on Reddit unless you want 100’s or 1000’s of liberals calling you out.

Also, when you hear or read a claim that you’d like to pass along to other Reddists that you cannot explain, give legitimate reasons for supporting, show evidence of, that claim is probably a lie, misconception or unfounded accusation.
For example, your claim of “ you hate conservatives” cannot be supported based on my two prior comments. You have no evidence of that. You don’t know me. It would be a waste of time for  me to argue with you over that. It would be a silly argument.Thus, I didn’t want to talk with you."
unpopularopinion,fcokecu,t3_ei2m58,1577834444.0,"Please explain the relation between your title and your main post.
I don’t understand.
Maybe I’m slow tonight. 
I think what you’re pointing out the hypocrisy of a person or group of people having negative perceptions of women based on them being or, at least, showing more emotion than men, then complaining when they think men need help to become more emotional and deal with their emotions.
Did I get it?
If so, yeah, that doesn’t make sense.
Is your post based on personal experience? 
I can see a man complaining that a woman is too emotional or bases her parenting on emotions, then turning around and complaining that he doesn’t get help or understanding for his emotions."
