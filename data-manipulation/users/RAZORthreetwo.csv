If you have conducted any survey where you can show some on-paper results, then you don't have to worry, your method will be in medical text soon.

Don't fool yourself that it's just a small breathing problem. There are two ways it can progress: one, either it gets alright on its own just like with tips like this straw one, while it is working only as a placebo, or two, it can exacerbate and then people will rush and call ambulance because now it's not just a ""strained breathing"".
