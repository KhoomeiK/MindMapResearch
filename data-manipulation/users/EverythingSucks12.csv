>on what? their service is worse than steam, no one cares about EGS outside of free stuff, for Epic at best all things equal people just don't care about the launcher, this ignores many people who like steams many features

>what reward? if they didn't have fortnite money this would be worlds dumbest idea

A stream of near passive income. And good thing they do have Fortnite's money to then. This is how businesses expand. Using revenue streams or investments to try and further their market share.

>it's a gimmick because you can't always have the exclusive so what happens when you no longer do?

They're just trying to get people invested in the environment.

>how is running negative in a market already heavily dominated by a successful popular franchise a solid approach?
>, there is no basis to believe this is a long term viable strat

This is LITERALLY what Microsoft did to break into the console market. Burnt through piles of cash from other revenue streams and use exclusives to get people to their platform. They famously made no profit on their original XBox, just churning through cash to establish themselves.

This strategy is employed in tonnes of industries. Sometimes successfully, sometimes not. The same is true of making a good product. Or any strategy.  But there is HUGE precedent this approach works.

You don't have to agree to the same risk / reward assessment that EGS's financial analysts do, it's yet to be seen if this will work out. But to say that's no reason to believe this will work is absurd.

>you kinda have to be a fanboi to even 'acknowledge' it might work

I don't even have it installed. I once played a bit of Dauntless (5ish hours) then went back to MHW on Steam, uninstalling EGS. I haven't even redeemed the free games. I'm not even in the same hemisphere as a fanboy. 

>except that objectively works, 30k to one guy for millions in contracts, lobbying is smarty money with a successful history 

As is burning cash to build a consumer base. Currently being employed aggressively by Amazon, with plenty of other examples.

Exlcusives are literally the primary strategy of every gaming environment. Origin, Steam when it launched, any console.

The only difference is EGS buys theirs instead of making / funding them, but the end result is the same: ""we have something you want"".

But sure, this strategy is dumb when EGS does it. Everyone else though was on the money."

> It seemed like the coolest place for so long. Riddled with common sense and an open attitude to life.

In addition to what others said, you're also overestimating how 'cool' Australia is. We have a chill image but we are still rampant with sexim, racism and homophobia, which unfortunately plays a very (sometimes subconscious) role in how people vote.

Liberals have an image problem. They're seen as weak which is conflated with homophobia, with a culture that strongly emphasis stereotypical masculinity. 

We have a large number of people that hate immigrants. 

We have our historical shames like the Stolen Generation, the Cronulla Riots and a ton of casual racism.

We might not seem as severe as the US, but remember we haven't been around as long and our population is much smaller than the US (our whole country has less people than California alone) so there's just less absolute noise.

>fantasy world where revenue is barely 30mil? and profit is likely a 3x loss?

No one is expecting then to turn a profit for years. They'll operate at a loss, burning through their Fortnite cash while trying to build a user base. Will it succeed? It's an unknown, being into this space is high risk / high reward. That doesn't mean the exclusives model isn't a viable strategy with a long term view to build a dedicated user base the way Steam has. Seems like a solid approach.

>why anyone would celebrate anti consumer behavior, fanbois smh

You're conflating my acknowledgement that this strategy might work with my approval of it.

I can acknowledge that political lobbying is an effective strategy while also thinking it's a disgusting abuse of democracy. Or that lying about alternative medicine works while thinking it's highly immoral.

At no point did I express approval of EGS or it's strategies. No idea where you got that idea from and weird you'd put those words in my mouth (I hate what Epic is doing, fyi, but it's really irrelevant to the discussion I didn't feel the need to inject my person thoughts into the discussion).
