Hasn't been true for years. They choose which demographic they aim their shows to on an individual basis now. Hell, they pretty much started doing this *with* Arrow.

Every subsequent season of a show is written based on which actor the creators are able to get though? What else do you want them to do?

And so are many other things that one should not dismiss simply because they are beloved by children. Chronicles of Narnia, Harry Potter, etc.
