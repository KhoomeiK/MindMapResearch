I would have thought Q1 and H1-H4 would be going for more."
minipainting,ff1yre6,t3_er6e83,1579489286.0,"Just the one?  I usually throw two at my party...  


Just kidding of course, this looks amazing, and I applaud your work."
PublicFreakout,fexzm8c,t1_fexqjho,1579438821.0,"I think it depends on if he's able to snapchat his going fugitive or not.  I don't think he has any real interest in fucking up his life forever, unless of course he's able to snapchat it all for the likes."
politics,femkomr,t1_femjpro,1579260376.0,"But they could have gotten the very same from Pence. I think they’re all afraid of 45 getting revenge on everyone if he’s ousted by spilling the beans once he’s gone, and the whole house of cards collapsing."
facepalm,felyvcj,t1_felwet4,1579234485.0,"I think you’re analyzing his post a little too hard. The post is about not being allowed to make a bad decision, yet being allowed to make another one with huge financial implications a mere three months later."
facepalm,felf5rk,t1_felep4c,1579220724.0,I'm under the impression that the Kansas City AI is a 4 year degree.  Is that not accurate?
facepalm,felddo1,t1_felb7ow,1579219539.0,"I have some friends and children of friends who have majored in art at various institutions (like these and at local universities that you might also go to for a business or English degree).  They both seem to be serving their purpose, and everyone I've spoken with has been happy with their respective experience."
facepalm,fel68ab,t1_fel4qmf,1579214937.0,"Chapter 7 bankruptcy. It’s not new obviously, but claiming the student loan portion, and having the judge sign off on it sort of is.  It’s a much more involved process to include a student loan, and up until this week was thought to be extremely hard to do."
facepalm,fel61or,t1_fel58zn,1579214822.0,"Well sure of course. But the problem lies in that if you have 10k, you have the means to repay your student loan. Part of filing bankruptcy is showing proof you do not have the means to pay your bills."
facepalm,fekpfnd,t1_fekp6r1,1579204875.0,It’s 52k a year (give or take) before scholarships. After its about 28k a year.  My state university was less 13k a year (including living expenses) no scholarships.
facepalm,feko04a,t1_fek6kul,1579204028.0,Kansas City Art Institute is about that much to attend I believe.  It’s really not that unheard of.  Though the 119k number most likely represents the full 4 years of education.
facepalm,feknj2v,t1_fek2ohp,1579203745.0,"There was actually just a court ruling this week that makes it easier to declare bankruptcy on student loans.  Only problem is that it usually takes about $10,000 in attorney’s fees to go through it. But the judgement did set the threshold of proving hardship at a far lower/easier level."
mattcolville,fekmzkz,t3_epcevb,1579203421.0,Very cool. I’m just about to run night below for the third time.  Well a home brew spin off version of it anyway. That’s one tough adventure to get through as players.
whatisthisthing,fekmmmg,t1_fejydo9,1579203206.0,"I would also add that I bet it would have more to do with temperature control and sensing than anything due to location and placement of the device. Code requirements for items (such as meat) to remain at or below a certain level is becoming a bigger industry, and an early detection system like this to sense if a room is getting warmer might be more plausible."
whatisthisthing,fekm1n1,t1_fejydo9,1579202861.0,"Why though?  A heat sensor or two in the same location would be substantially less money to install, and wouldn’t require a control panel capable of cat6 cable for initiation devices. Most stores like this (large grocery chains) want as cheap a system as they can get away with by code."
ReaperMiniatures,feiffzi,t3_epavgp,1579137276.0,Looks great.  I can't wait for the Bones V version to come out too.
videos,fefsfcg,t1_fefrcz7,1579063809.0,"You ask Alex Trebeck questions. Thing is, he’s psychic and is able to give you the answer before you even ask."

videos,febnmhh,t3_eo6axc,1578960742.0,He could be in a band or something.
criticalrole,fe8hqq9,t3_eo3ed8,1578926282.0,"The art reminds me of the 1977 Hobbit movie.  Especially on King Dwindle.   I’m actually okay with it if it turns out to be the official art. Nostalgia and all that. And at this point I’d throw Mercer up there with the great fantasy world builders such as Tolkien. Yup, I said it."
Pathfinder_RPG,fdwdrf9,t3_en6rmf,1578757646.0,"The spell weapon wand and then wands of touch delivering attacks such as shocking grasp or icy touch.  That plus a keen weapon (as someone mentioned already), with the aforementioned metamagic feats too."
ObscureMedia,fdmdry1,t1_fdlei2u,1578546632.0,"I’d argue that The Blaire Witch’s website changed the game for studios, after they saw the mass marketing appeal it could have for relatively low cost."
politics,fdi3h4i,t1_fdi2eko,1578435064.0,"The guy won’t even speak poorly of Russia. And by that I mean he trips over himself to fawn all over Russia and Putin. Literally can’t say an even slightly interpretable as negative thing about them.  Nothing he has done has been to be reflected poorly towards Russia. Congress and the Senate may have done something, but I am hard pressed to think of anything.  The Republican Party literally put planks in their 2016 platform to reverse past actions taken against Russia. They are bought and paid for lapdogs at this point. Traitors, every one of them."
politics,fdhv3sw,t1_fdhc905,1578430682.0,Have you forgotten that since leaving office he continually speaks coherently and in complete sentences to make the current president look bad!?!?
politics,fdhl634,t1_fdhb8y1,1578424982.0,My argument would be that this is by design and a part of the plan. I truly believe that Putin is making Trump make bad economic decisions (and even military and policy decisions) to help usher the US into a spending spree that will result in its financial collapse. Similar to what the USSR experienced in the late 1980’s/ early 1990’s. And once the US began to rebuild it would be no where near the world influencer it once was—allowing Russia and China to take that place.

On a more serious note, congrats to Finland for being much more progressive than the rest of the world."
PublicFreakout,fcpab51,t1_fcp8siw,1577855982.0,"I actually always thought they were fairly legit.  My wife was actually asked to be on one of these types of shows when she was going through a divorce with her first husband (she declined).  Apparently the shows hire people to just comb through local court records and reach out to anyone who is willing to do the show instead of going through with the court proceedings.  It wouldn't surprise me if there were some people who try to fake it (as with anything associated with trips and cash at the end of it), but all in all, I think they are legit people for the most part."
todayilearned,fc73pgm,t1_fc6u0bf,1577496707.0,Oh I had no idea that was the same guy that wrote all of the Drizzt Do'Urden books.  That guy has such a huge following in that fantasy genre.  Its a shame he had to endure that.
interestingasfuck,fc3q74y,t3_efxzdv,1577395880.0,"I once saw the “world’s largest piece of jade”. It wasn’t nearly as large as this tree, but it was carved very similarly. I got to get within inches of it and the security guard even let me touch it. Was amazing. Such detail, and ones you would miss if you were even just feet away. I bet this tree is similar. The best my city’s craftsmen offer is interesting spray paint art on occasion."
