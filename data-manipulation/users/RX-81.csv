I've been into PC's for years now and I've gathered info along the way. I repaired several systems for my parents and school and I've built and replaced parts for my personal PC. I had to do a lot of troubleshooting in my PC because I received several bad used parts so I learned a lot there. 

For every problem my troubleshooting is different. I see what the problem is. If I think it might be a hardware problem I re-build the PC and replace parts that might be broken. If i'm not sure what the problem is then I ask the internet, sites like Toms Hardware helped me out in countless problems.
