GreenBayPackers,ff88h59,t1_ff7rwf2,1579669056.0,"Thanks for being the rationale one in this conversation than just spewing hate. My dad and I talked extensively on the day of the game about other distractions that draw Rodgers into a mindset that makes him continue to think he's the best in the league when he isn't. These things includes all of his endorsements from various companies, his relationship with Dannika( not saying a relationship is bad because that is own personal life), and his obsession with money. I can't speak for his motivations on and off the field and how it changes from season to season, but I sometimes see many times, Rodgers playing half ass in every game until he absolutely had to step it up to win. It would make things less stressful of he found a more even kill for playing more consistently in a game and getting scores throughtout the game instead of the last quarter. Maybe some of my thought is wrong and I'm okay with admitting it, but he is getting older, we haven't won a Superbowl in 9 years with one of the supposedly best quarterbacks in the league. I think it might be time to start thinking about training up a new guy that can take his place."

I always thought love was a choice and an emotion but at the end of the day was always rooted in that choice. However, my experience has been when I've chosen to love her, she left based on the feeling. It's as if men are hardwired to go the distance even if the current isn't always flowing knowing that the current will be there every once in a while.
