vegan,fe18fby,t1_fdw59vn,1578823735.0,When a cosmetic brand sells their products in China they essentially are complicit in the Chinese version of the FDA testing the brand’s products on animals. So companies like Mac can say they don’t test on animals because they don’t run any tests on animals. But the federal regulators of cosmetics in China DO test Mac products on animals. It’s a bit of a clusterf- but essentially the real problem is China. And if you see what is happening in Hong Kong well... good luck changing the Chinese government.

Yesterday went well but I am hitting a couple of snags and spent some time journaling this morning to reflect on why that might be.

Some background is that I have trauma-related OCPD tendencies which can spiral into depression and insomnia. And so for my goals I’ve tried to be very not OCPD haha, and to catch my cognitive distortions. That means saying 20 minutes of exercise is okay and not tracking my calories, not weighing myself, and generally not having kind of weirdly impossible and rigid ideas about things (I really do not need to lose weight and was underweight a couple months ago).

However, with a couple of my goals I’ve been too non-descriptive, specifically with weight-lifting and taking photos every day. For photos I have figured it out.

So I am looking for a weight-training routine. I primarily am a cyclist but I’m also trying to run a couple times a week since running in an airport in December was a real heart attack / sweaty eye opener. I know squats and SL deadlifts should be on the menu but my upperbody is also weeak. I need to be able to do these things at home. Any suggestions? I find searching on the internet for these things a bit shit. I own a kettlebell, dumbbells and some smaller elastic loops.

Meditated... My 2020 mantra is “20 minutes is enough” so I got on my bike and surprised myself by hanging in there for an hour. Also went for a walk this evening which I am trying to do before bed to help with said insomnia.

Spent like three hours drawing which was kind of a surprise, talked to a friend from the US on the phone and also bailed on a LAN party so I could stay zen.

I sometimes think streak running can be a sort of cognitive distortion - specifically all or nothing / black and white thinking.

Drawing is a skill and requires relatively little talent. I think most people that are off the bat “talented” at drawing are just good at seeing past how our brain simplifies things visually.

I have continued forward by reminding myself of a couple things: 1) even if the memories are not clear they happened during a pivotal time of brain development and still effect me 2) often children cope with traumatic shit by focusing on something else going on (like wallpaper/paint or a piece of furniture/decoration in the room) Or believing themself to be the “bad guy” 3) because of 2 often we can’t contextualize how much something, even if we only vaguely remember, messed us up until we have the perspective of an adult.

When I remember these things then I know that my cognitions that I am wasting the therapist’s time and my trauma is too vague makes sense - they fit in with the model of how children cope with trauma.

3.	Everyday: Journal, practice dutch, physical therapy exercises, my personal yoga practice, meditation, drinking plenty of water, and reading. Edit: one photo per day

5.	Weightlifting 3x/week (MWF), running 3x a week"

I mean, Avedon died 15 years ago. Yes, there are professional retouchers now separate from photographers but everyone I know (which is not many) that has broken into the biz in the last couple years did so by working on both their photography and their retouching. I’m also living in europe as an American so my network is very small, which is the primary reason to go to school. There’s no success in isolation. I really appreciate your advice and time! I am planning to hire a model and MUAH for some new portfolio work once I have the hang of editing and I think that will help a lot - just working with people that take good care of their skin.

We are all anatomically different and some poses are not going to agree with a personâ€™s individual anatomy.

FWIW Iâ€™m a yoga teacher and Iâ€™ve been able to put my legs/feet behind my head my whole life, but I have never been able to do the splits! A lot of the photos we see on the internet are people showing what they happen to be good at.

Good luck, and keep practicing!"

All that being said, it sounds like your body or nervous system is trying to protect something. See a fysio if you can."

Letâ€™s reframe her comment: â€œWhen I hear someone speaking about losing weight it reinforces my negative beliefs about my body size.â€

Suddenly she is a lot less aggressive and it becomes clear that the underlying issue is her system of beliefs, not what you said.

Anyways, as others have mentioned, I hope she gets some therapy."
ArtFundamentals,fd8fiac,t3_ek4ym4,1578217792.0,Iâ€™m with you! These effers are really hard! I have started to do a half page ellipses plus planes in ellipses as a warm up and Iâ€™m trying to let go of my perfectionism.

90daysgoal,fd88ctb,t3_ek6arb,1578215156.0,"**TL;DR** I am a cyclist first, runner second, looking for a 20-30 minute home weight training routine, do you have any suggestions? It can be longer I guess but then I will need to arrange it by priority.

Yesterday went well but I am hitting a couple of snags and spent some time journaling this morning to reflect on why that might be.

Some background is that I have trauma-related OCPD tendencies which can spiral into depression and insomnia. And so for my goals Iâ€™ve tried to be very not OCPD haha, and to catch my cognitive distortions. That means saying 20 minutes of exercise is okay and not tracking my calories, not weighing myself, and generally not having kind of weirdly impossible and rigid ideas about things (I really do not need to lose weight and was underweight a couple months ago).

However, with a couple of my goals Iâ€™ve been too non-descriptive, specifically with weight-lifting and taking photos every day. For photos I have figured it out.

So I am looking for a weight-training routine. I primarily am a cyclist but Iâ€™m also trying to run a couple times a week since running in an airport in December was a real heart attack / sweaty eye opener. I know squats and SL deadlifts should be on the menu but my upperbody is also weeak. I need to be able to do these things at home. Any suggestions? I find searching on the internet for these things a bit shit. I own a kettlebell, dumbbells and some smaller elastic loops.

Edit for formatting And I forgot BQ

**BQ** In my ideal round 31 I stick with it and donâ€™t get overwhelmed or slide into weird thinking patterns. Stress-free is not one word but ah well"

90daysgoal,fd5d51d,t3_ejscm1,1578176436.0,"Beep beep. Today went well, slept kind of late which is great because I struggle with depression/insomnia.

Meditated... My 2020 mantra is â€œ20 minutes is enoughâ€ so I got on my bike and surprised myself by hanging in there for an hour. Also went for a walk this evening which I am trying to do before bed to help with said insomnia.

Spent like three hours drawing which was kind of a surprise, talked to a friend from the US on the phone and also bailed on a LAN party so I could stay zen.

Didnâ€™t really practice yoga today but I guess Iâ€™ll go do savasana in bed lol"

I sometimes think streak running can be a sort of cognitive distortion - specifically all or nothing / black and white thinking. My biggest struggle (more with cycling than running) has always been resting and letting go of perfectionism. We see other people resting and itâ€™s fine but hold ourselves to a different, often higher standard.

I read the first two quickly but now TBH I kind of lag every time I get to a chapter from a character or storyline Iâ€™ve deemed boring, even though itâ€™s not really boring, itâ€™s just not as exciting as other bits. I do prefer it a lot to the show/dumpster fire that was GoT seasons 6-8.

Drawing is a skill and requires relatively little talent. I think most people that are off the bat â€œtalentedâ€ at drawing are just good at seeing past how our brain simplifies things visually. Nice that you are sharing it with your daughter and showing interest in her interest. Good parenting vibes!"

CPTSD,fcx28iu,t3_ej0xwr,1578047985.0,"Hello! I am doing trauma therapy and also have many of the same cognitions. I canâ€™t remember things clearly and I thinking Iâ€™m taking up time and space from someone with â€œreal trauma.â€ Even though kid me went through some seriousLy effed up shit.

I have continued forward by reminding myself of a couple things: 1) even if the memories are not clear they happened during a pivotal time of brain development and still effect me 2) often children cope with traumatic shit by focusing on something else going on (like wallpaper/paint or a piece of furniture/decoration in the room) Or believing themself to be the â€œbad guyâ€ 3) because of 2 often we canâ€™t contextualize how much something, even if we only vaguely remember, messed us up until we have the perspective of an adult.

When I remember these things then I know that my cognitions that I am wasting the therapistâ€™s time and my trauma is too vague makes sense - they fit in with the model of how children cope with trauma.

Most of my goals are things I already do but I would like to be a bit more consistent.

1.	big goal: cycle around lake Markemeer by the end of 90 days. (Approximately 204km/126 miles)
2.	For January I would like to eat vegan as much as possible. After January a general reduction in animal products - 2 vegan meals a day or at least a lot more vegetables.
3.	Everyday: Journal, practice dutch, physical therapy exercises, my personal yoga practice, meditation, drinking plenty of water, and reading. Edit: one photo per day
4.	non-commuter biking six days per week, a minimum of 20 minutes.
5.	Weightlifting 3x/week (MWF), running 3x a week"
photography,fb71rq6,t1_fb4lg87,1576569472.0,"I generally agree with you (especially about art school), and I think itâ€™s important to note that photographers like Leibovitz and Avedon rose to prominence in a very different photographic reality. I mean, Avedon died 15 years ago. Yes, there are professional retouchers now separate from photographers but everyone I know (which is not many) that has broken into the biz in the last couple years did so by working on both their photography and their retouching. Iâ€™m also living in europe as an American so my network is very small, which is the primary reason to go to school. Thereâ€™s no success in isolation. I really appreciate your advice and time! I am planning to hire a model and MUAH for some new portfolio work once I have the hang of editing and I think that will help a lot - just working with people that take good care of their skin. Thanks for your time!! It was helpful."
