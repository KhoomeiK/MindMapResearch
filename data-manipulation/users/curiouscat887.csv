AskMen,fdh90c7,t1_fdh7o88,1578417990.0,"The difference between 1800 and 2500 is quite a lot, as an example there are 3500 calories per lb of fat, so a 500 calorie reduction below maintenance will make someone lose on average 1lb per week, 700 calories below would be even more. 

So not taking into account body fat % or muscle mass if your only hitting 1800 on some days then  I think it would be safe to say your definitely not eating enough.

I’d personally quit the cereal, it’s doesn’t really contain any nutrients, I have a tip for a 800-1000 calorie breakfast shake.

You will have to work up to this In terms of the oat quantity but it will hit a big % of your calorie needs in the morning, leaving you to fill the rest with your usual diet over the course of the day.

Add 60-100g of oats, 20-30g whey protein powder ( chocolate flavour works well) , 
1 banana, 300ml full fat milk, 10ml olive oil or 20g coconut oil and a table spoon of peanut butter.
Then blend it all together. 

It tastes really good, if it’s too thick add some water and re blend.

I drink this everyday when bulking. 

Also if your interested in weight training I’d  highly recommend it as this will add some good size onto you with the right nutrition, if you want to learn more I recommend T-nation.com the website and forum. 

Try aim for 500 -700 calories per meal, focus on high protein meals, you want fats too! Fats are good, only trans fats are bad. 
Plus plenty of complex carbs as these are your main energy source.

Maybe aim for 40% protein, 30% carbs and 20% fats in your diet/ meals if you want to get technical but to keep it simple if you added that shake and then made sure you had a big lunch and a big dinner both at around 700 calories, plus some snacks throughout the day I’m sure you’ll put weight on."

I bulk on 3000-3500.

2500 calories in a sedentary job should have you at a much higher weight, are you 100% positive your hitting 2500? And from nutritious food? 

I don’t mean to sound condescending or anything I’m genuinely curious. 

Also are you male or female?

And yeah muscle mass is the ideal weight to gain, fat won’t help you in terms of health unless your body fat % is seriously low.

Your bodies immune system usually doesn’t spot the cancer in the first place but I’m assuming by triggering an immune response to that area it would then cause the immune system to also detect the cancer cells and then destroy them, the body can easily kill a cancer cell if it knows where it is.
