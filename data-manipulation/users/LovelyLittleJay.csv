omad,ffan4ak,t3_es57gj,1579739843.0,You look absolutely amazing! Congratulations on your OMAD!
AmItheAsshole,ffaki7o,t1_ff8r7uu,1579738007.0,"Exactly! I have asthma but cigarette smoke immediately makes my throat close up. As a child I would throw away my grandfather’s cigarettes because I couldn’t breath and he use to get so mad. Now if someone comes into my work place smelling of cigarettes I have a minor reaction, as if my lungs will stop short at the inhalation. I can persist but then I’ll cough the rest of the day. This dude sucks. YTA."
fatlogic,ffaj6u3,t3_ese53d,1579737043.0,"I fly 3-4 times per year. I actually love flying. I’ve done both first class and economy, overseas and continental. I can sit cross legged when I want, which is good because I naturally sit with one foot tucked under me. 

But I’m still not a house cat."
lowcarb,ffafbcu,t3_esgx2y,1579734395.0,Their spinach artichoke dip is tasty! And only 2 carbs a serving. It’s in the frozen section.
offmychest,ff5g2ij,t3_erhisj,1579591310.0,"It depends on the cheating. I “emotionally cheated” and it helped me get out of an extremely abusive marriage and now I’m thriving. With my ex husband he cut off all my resources, friends, relatives, even work. Wouldn’t let me get a car. Lies about rent and bills so I paid more. So yeah, when someone saw me as a person and invested in me emotionally I cheated “emotionally” and grew enough confidence to ask for a divorce. Now I’m a much happier person.

Not every cheating story is black and white."
AmItheAsshole,ff290m1,t3_er5mf1,1579497351.0,"NAH that’s more than a full course load where I’m from and I’m in school right now. When I take more than 3 classes at a time I have to meet with my advisor and show them that I’m only going to work part time and the high advise against more than 20 hours per week.

Edit: what’s he in school for? This really determines a lot of things. For instance I’m full time employed this semester specifically because I was told the class I’m taking requires 30+ hours a week. It’s one class. But yes, it’s that demanding and it’s all I’m taking this time round."
AmItheAsshole,ff24wkl,t3_er0h4e,1579493897.0,"NTA he shouldn’t have said any of those comments, and the whole “you’re not (whatever racial characteristics they deem worthy) enough” is just gatekeeping nonsense. 

PS, I just googled your hair type and I am envious! I love that hair type, it’s gorgeous :) Though difficult time maintain I imagine."
netflix,ff23yq1,t3_er5wyd,1579493157.0,"Another thing it could be, and this goes across all languages, is that the script doesn’t perfectly match what’s spoken. The script is usually what is typed out for subtitles. I get frustrated with this with French as well as English. 

I always watch tv with subtitles, even in my own language, because I do other activities while the tv is on. Even in instances of tone or music that is subtitled sometimes things do not match up. Yesterday while watching Grace and Frankie a character was supposed to have whispered something, subtitle read “word” (whispered) but the character hadn’t whispered at all. Another character was supposed to have (cleared throat) but that hadn’t happened. And this was in English."
IsItBullshit,fewnkmq,t1_fewdebv,1579415868.0,As someone in the medical field tell me exactly which hormones affect weight gain.
AskReddit,fewescy,t3_eqies2,1579409388.0,"There’s this section on my drive home. It’s up hill, two lane road, with forest on both sides. There’s a curved part where you have to pull your steering wheel pretty hard to the right, and then you straighten out towards the traffic light. At night, this means you’re eclipsed in darkness and then this light appears. This part lasts about 10-15 seconds depending on speed. Speed limit is 40, and I never go above 50or below 40, because I want to get home. 

One day I started on that curve and it just didn’t end. It was so long I felt I would never get out. Seeing that traffic light was like taking in air after being underwater. I remember thinking, why isn’t this ending? This is so odd...what’s wrong???

Second time I got freaked out because it lasted almost the length of a 3 minute song. 

Since then it’s happened multiple times. I don’t freak out anymore. But I do time the length of it every time I take that curve."
nextfuckinglevel,femeg1k,t3_epvhl5,1579251243.0,This is absolutely darling! Love it.
fatlogic,fem2p7n,t3_eppxr0,1579237786.0,If this went down in my first aid/CPR class I would have left. No way would I believe someone that delusional to be able to properly teach me.
fatlogic,fekueme,t1_fekrtan,1579207809.0,The last time I looked at one of those studies the unintentionally underweight people were mostly those who had cancer. Of course they fared worse than someone with obesity.
fatlogic,fekr6s8,t1_fekjmrf,1579205916.0,Thank you for such a thorough explanation! I’m now just mostly horrified by all of this. This is some insane thinking on their part. It also makes me question the few people I’ve seen in this sub come to the defense of intuitive eating.
fatlogic,fekhhhu,t1_fek8u3z,1579200140.0,"I don’t understand what intuitive eating is. I thought it was as you’ve described, eating when hungry, stopping when full. Listening to the hunger cues of your body. I was even willing to accept the idea that sometimes this means eating things not necessarily nutritious for the sake of satisfying a craving. But after reading those linked articles I’m just confused. What’s the point of intuitive eating?"
AskReddit,fejcf5s,t1_feiz92v,1579167032.0,The end when he meets her as an old woman always has me bawling. He sacrificed so much to make sure she grew to that age.
fatlogic,fej87kq,t1_fej7ccc,1579161072.0,"Likely this person explained how their ED was “restrictive” to their therapist, the therapist said no that’s not how restriction works, and then tried to get them to see their real issue. The therapist realized that their client didn’t want real help but to be validated by their warped reality so the therapist bounced. 

I’ve done outpatient group therapy for AN recovery and witnessed something similar. An obese girl who insisted she had restrictive anorexia to me because she was only eating 1,400 calories per day. I said hmm but I managed to not roll my eyes. Eating your TDDE is not an ED."
fatlogic,fegvbzf,t1_fegofg1,1579103352.0,Cane sugar or beet sugar consumption might be down but high fructose corn syrup is in everything and is indeed up in consumption.
fatlogic,fefwixg,t1_fefullz,1579067508.0,"I can get that. When I looked at people in terms of weight distribution I was kind of shocked. Obese is so normal. Obese is “chubby”. But I must say, I gained 10 pounds because I was an asshole to my body and drank and ate whatever I wanted and my blood panel showed it on the cholesterol portion. Nothing alarming but higher levels than last year. My eating revamp began when I saw that."
fatlogic,fefpzrn,t3_eomg76,1579061932.0,"In class last Thursday we’re discussing diabetes mellitus type 2 and it’s correlation to obesity. Love my professor, he’s explaining how bad obesity is and all the health risk beautifully. Going in depth about how on a cellular level obesity leads to diabetes type 2. Then a a girl piped up “so when you say obesity, do you mean in the medical sense?” Note, this is a class for nursing students, so what other sense was she talking about?

He says “uh yes, I guess so...?” And she continues “it’s just that, my doctor told me I’m obese, but I mean, obviously I’m not” This is when I go to look at her. She’s got a puffy jacket on and I can’t tell her body composition, but she does have a double chin, and I dunno her doctor is probably right?  I mean he/she would know better than my eye balls. She then goes on a tirade about BMI and how obesity isn’t correct and how we don’t really know what it is because obviously she’s not obese. Her doctor is wrong, she’s not heading towards diabetes like they said. The worst part is my professor agree with her because he’s a super tall guy and an obvious outlier and he too was once called close to over weight. But he never mentions that he’s an outlier due to his height. And when we’re dismissed I can clearly see that she’s obese. I hate how people are going into the medical community and totally dismissing medical evidence."
AmItheAsshole,fefkhvp,t1_fefhd42,1579058250.0,"Yeah, and a lot can happen in a few weeks. This is why some moms who are planning to give up their baby dont want to hold or even see their baby when it comes out. There’s a greater chance of changing your mind once the oxytocin kicks in and you’re holding your baby. 

I don’t think this makes the OP TA, but I do wonder how much communication was going on."
AmItheAsshole,fe6itn1,t3_eny5fh,1578892265.0,YTA. You’re going to lose a good employee and make it so much harder on your “team” once you can’t find a great replacement.
fatlogic,fe06ees,t3_enibgq,1578804221.0,"As a fellow nursing student did she skip the section on venous return and how extra adipose tissue creates an issue for it, thus you know slowing down healing? Is she actually just completely full of shit? Looking like a yes."
fatlogic,fdpqyq9,t3_emmi2c,1578637159.0,Yet. They don’t have diabetes yet. Give it time though...
science,fdmsrjz,t3_em4st3,1578563968.0,"Every time I tried looking at the linked studies from the article it would not pull up anything, so I couldn’t see the actual study. That being said, fatty liver disease, which use to be associated mainly with alcoholics, is now more prevalent due to high obesity. Over consumption of sugar leads to the same disease. Which could account for a portion of the increase. Someone correct if I’m wrong though on the study, I couldn’t access the info."
insaneparents,fdmrgz1,t1_fdmqu1r,1578562140.0,Ah okay! Well good luck to you :)
insaneparents,fdmqpzd,t1_fdmq33h,1578561096.0,"If you can, sleep a bit propped up head wise so it won’t happen until your meds kick in. I’m assuming they’re for your acid reflux. It’s an awful feeling to aspirate your stomach acid. The only equal feeling is if you’ve ever aspirated an alcohol spirit like vodka. My uncle did that, his gasps were frightening and he said it felt like he was drowning under fire."
insaneparents,fdmpyve,t1_fdmovol,1578560044.0,"They did, thankfully. Unrelated, but my ex who is a lawyer had a case he had an assignment on regarding Johnson’s baby oil where something similar happened. Kid was caught with baby oil, accidentally inhaled it because the mom angrily shouted “what are you doing?!”, coated the lungs so they were without oxygen for 5 minutes if I remember correctly. Survived but sever brain damage. Parents sued because they had no clue that this could cause lung collapse. 

One time I accidentally inhaled some of my acid reflux and that was the worse pain I ever felt. Lungs on fire. Crying is what finally helped the pain subside due to the extra fluid washing over the lungs, thinning out the acid."
fatlogic,fdmnpqa,t3_em4tj8,1578557088.0,Man I’m gonna have fun showing this post to my professor tomorrow when we discuss diabetes in class. Who knew that instead of being taught about this disease by the chairman of the science department I really should have gone over to an Econ professor?
insaneparents,fdmiqkz,t3_em3r68,1578551366.0,"Parents who do this disgust me. We had a professor in my A and P class who talked about an ER case where a parent did this to their child with liquid soap. Poor kid struggled and ended up inhaling some of it. Guess what happens when a super sticky substance hits your lungs and mixes with the fluide there? Bubbles and a partial lung collapse. Kid couldn’t breath, parent called for an ambulance. Suddenly their punishment went from abuse to potential death."
fatlogic,fdkqazb,t3_elw2xp,1578508928.0,Let’s flip their logic. If you have to manipulate your diet by eating any amount of extra calories per day and make sure you’re mostly sedentary so you’re guaranteed to gain weight then you’re not actually meant to be overweight/obese and it’s not genetics.
fatlogic,fdi6v7c,t1_fdi4p7x,1578436791.0,"A body fat percentage of over 32% is considered obese, with 25-31% being overweight. You’re obese dude."
fatlogic,fdg5plf,t1_fdfk5ha,1578381072.0,"It is disordered eating, but it’s not anorexia. It’s not the romanticized eating disorder they wish for. And I really hate that they keep masquerading their binge eating as such. I mean, they honestly do not know what it’s like to be an anorectic. It’s horrible. I mean, sometimes my friends remind me of the crazy shit I did and I feel so stupid. For instance, in a company of 150+ employees I was known as the sugar free girl because when people went on coffee runs I always asked for sugar free syrup but I was also so deep in my disorder that when they brought my drink to me I would “taste” real sugar and insist up to 5 people try my drink to make sure it was sugar free. Can you imagine the office weirdo shoving their iced americano with sugar free vanilla in other employees faces demanding to know if it’s sugar free or not? I don’t know how I wasn’t fired."
AmItheAsshole,fdg1bgn,t1_fdfd2jv,1578376403.0,"This is the vibe I’m getting from some comments on here. Especially the ones jumping to BDD. It’s as if you’re suppose to just love how your body looks after going through the often traumatic experience of birth, and if you want your old body back you’re just vain or have something wrong with you. It’s a ridiculous idea."
fatlogic,fd624tl,t3_ek3vy3,1578184503.0,"This is a joke account right? Right? Like no one, not even the anti-vax crowd, okay maybe the anti-vax crowd, is that stupid."
fatlogic,fcmts2l,t1_fcmm6jm,1577791888.0,"A BMI of 25-30 is certainly becoming a growing group and leading to a perception of it being normal. But no, it’s not normal or healthy in any regard. A BMI of 35 is class two obesity. You should be concerned at overweight, or even the upper end of healthy if it’s looking to go up. Not when your class two obese."
fatlogic,fcmtj71,t1_fclrsa1,1577791546.0,"If they cared about any of that they would stop making excuses and lose the weight. But they don’t. They really do care about how being thin is more attractive in society, and they themselves are often more attracted to thin/fit people. Especially the loudest FA women bloggers. Good god are they puzzling, they hate thin women but they sure do believe they deserve a fit guy."
fatlogic,fcharcr,t1_fcbx5we,1577648844.0,Same. It’s been super helpful to not even have to care about “good” or “bad” food.
AskReddit,fc374di,t1_fc2fblo,1577383060.0,"It’s considered the desirable ED to those who know about or have an ED. I know this because I have an ED. Like alcoholism, they never go away and require constant upkeep. Currently I’m in remission from mine, which is good as I’m in nursing school.

But thank you for all your helpful info."
AskReddit,fc2b5t2,t3_efs468,1577349796.0,Anorexia. So many people claim to have/ had had it because it’s the “desirable” eating disorder but most people have something else.
AskReddit,fc1z5lg,t1_fc1yztg,1577334340.0,"Lolli and Pops. Didn’t even know I was getting it at the time, I was originally buying a gift for my boyfriend and they asked if I wanted my sign up gift."
insaneparents,fc1yz47,t3_efqe95,1577334168.0,Why did they have a kid? Did they think “oh I’ll bring someone into the world but then they’ll owe me everything for bringing them into existence” Why do some parents do this insane shit?
