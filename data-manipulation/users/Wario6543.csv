Only because DC has some weird special status."
Askpolitics,ffydb6q,t1_ffxpj20,1580343697.0,Thank You! It’s like people don’t understand this ducking concept at all!
MurderedByWords,ffwrt4x,t1_ffvv65c,1580309473.0,I did 6 years worth of reading.
MurderedByWords,ffvrcjt,t1_ffvpjpr,1580271090.0,"I think the point here is that you shouldn’t be a racist and blame Chinese people for a problem they arguably didn’t cause or want to happen. 

A surprising number of non-white cultures adhered to basic hygiene principles before germ theory was accepted. 

The Japanese in particular were extremely clean while Europeans bathed once or twice a year."

animeplot,ffrjki1,t3_euqbfh,1580159329.0,"Do you think they’ll release an uncut version after it’s initial release? 

Usually I wait for the censor bars to go away before watching an anime like this. Lol"
detroitlions,ff2eyz8,t1_ff2678u,1579503344.0,Wel for sure. I root for the lions in every situation. But when they inevitably fail. I like to have another horse in the race and Wisconsin isn’t terrible.
harrypotter,ff1y0eg,t3_er69eh,1579488768.0,I think we should use Ilvermorny houses for US presidents. lol
harrypotter,ff1xrwo,t1_ff1u907,1579488607.0,Bush a Griffindor? Seems like a he didn’t have much courage and if what he did was Charisma then I guess I don’t know what that word means. Lol

detroitlions,ff1sckw,t3_er5kx5,1579485101.0,Is it only because my family is from the Upper Peninsula that I root for the Packers as my secondary team?
Askpolitics,ff0cvku,t1_ff08qjf,1579467664.0,"Inflation is caused by supply and demand principles. A universal basic income may temporarily raise the cost of some things but the market usually stabilized by increasing supply when demand increases. 

Monetary inflation occurs when more money is put into circulation causing its value to be less. 

If Yang taxes billionaires and then gives that money to poorer people it doesn’t increase or decrease the supply of money in the country, it only redistributes it."
Askpolitics,ff08op4,t3_er1eau,1579466364.0,That’s not how inflation works my brotha.

CNN has a rating of over 56% mostly to all true statements. 

Fox has 21%. 

You sit there and tell me both sides are lying to me equally but the facts tel me otherwise."
environment,feoqyqc,t1_feoo3z7,1579304271.0,"There are not nearly as many falsehoods published by major news organizations than there are in right wing “news” outlets. 

Fox “News” relays more falsehoods on a daily basis than CNN and MSNBC does in a year. 

This isn’t one of those “both sides are bad” situations."
environment,fenm5t6,t3_eq3r9x,1579287647.0,That’s because Murdoch has almost singlehandedly eroded every democracy that has allowed him to push falsehoods on a gullible population.

news,fei2i6r,t1_fei1z0m,1579128847.0,"The article you posted says the investigation was inconclusive and they couldn’t prove it was him in the photo. 

Besides 1984 wasn’t a very progressive time period if I’m remembering correctly. 

Does he act like a racist? Are the policies he has enacted disproportionately discriminate against people of color? Or are you just saying that to make a “bad people on both sides” argument. 

Because the racists trying to storm the capital with guns seems like the baddies here."
