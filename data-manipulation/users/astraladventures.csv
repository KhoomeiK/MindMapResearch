CanadaPolitics,ff8iy17,t1_ff6u80e,1579680614.0,"Look at it from the point of view of China. Here you have Canada basically getting on their knees to take in the big, fat American cock whilst giving an embarrassed sideways smile back to China.  America leaning back with an ecstatic facial look, gives a nice hearty grunt  and a two-handed thumbs up back to China.

Who the hell made the Americans the ultimate rulers of the planet? Who says they can unilaterally impose their will on the world? Who says the Americans should be allowed to unilaterally pull out of and not honour international agreements, agreements  they had already signed and committed to?  Who gave the Americans the right to  then unilaterally create laws prohibiting anyone they want from doing business with that country? Who says the Americans get to determine who is right and who is wrong, who is good and who is bad? With their absolutely horrendous record in manipulating world events?  With their overseers gloating at the chance to knock down Iran a peg or two. 

And why? Just because the Americans are afraid of an up and coming global power that is threatening their position? Of possibly giving a little choice to the rest of the world, from a developing country which is doing more to raise up the poor countries in the world then the West ever did? Afraid of a rising star company of that global power which is offering the world an alternative to the American sphere of influence and monopoly of corporate control?

Sure, I understand it is tough for little Canada with our raspy little voice to stand up to our massive brother to the south, but don't play the fool and pretend we are surprised by what China did when we caved in to the finger snap of Donald Trump and his overseers."

My point is that there are so many gaps in the story and facts released to the public, one could drive a truck through them.  But I read people on here (not necessarily you personally), just happily lapping it up, seemingly believing without critical questioning what Trudeau has been told by the Americans (bc you know for a fact that the intelligence he refers to came from them). 

So my questions are, what exactly are the facts firstly that, 1) it was a missile; 2) it was an Iranian missile launched by the Iranian military; 3) that the Iranians did not intend to launch this missile / did not intend to hit this civilian aircraft; and 4) if they did not intend to hit this aircraft, an explanation as to why in fact they did hit the aircraft. 

I have seen toooooo many sneaky and clandestine and false flag operations perpetrated by govts in general and the US specifically, just to take everything being spilled out to the media on only the 5 day or so after the incident at face value. 95% of people will likely be satisified with this response even though there is so much unanswered that the matter will be pushed back to old news cycle stock very quickly. 

And yes I suspect more to the eye, but it is not necessarily only the Americans I suspect, maybe there was the other foreign govts involved like the Chinese who really are down on the Canadians this last year because of the Huawei matter.

legaladvicecanada,fd6rm9a,t1_fd6eiu9,1578194866.0,"Why is your ex in a women's shelter? Why were you told that you need a background check?  It sounds like your ex has expressed personal safety concerns about your presence with her or the baby.  It won't help you at all, if  you insist or persist to push back against what they are telling you. In fact, quite the contrary. Anything negative will be carefully recorded and could be used against you in any future custody case between you and your ex.    

While it is understandable and commendable that as the father you want to see your baby and feel frustrated that you are getting stonewalled by the shelter, but it is really in the best interests of your new child as well as your own, to play ball with them, back off as necessary and obtain legal counsel for advice including  your child naming rights.  You need to think of what is best in the long term interests of your relationship with your child.  

Lawyer up and do not let your emotions dictate your behavior."

Also, we had the same doctor throughout the pregnancy up to and including the delivery and aftercare....

shanghai,fd5vb6x,t1_fd2o96e,1578181942.0,"I believe we had our child's Cdn passport within a couple months - I know we were flying with him when he was 4 months.  

There should be no impact on the child being born outside Canada to Canadian parents. However, I believe the Canadian laws state that if that child were to have their future child outside Canada, then that child (your grandchild), would have to establish his / her Canadian citizenship through an application or actually returning to live in Canada when they are 18 (not sure of the details on this)."
shanghai,fd5sx7j,t3_ejs9u7,1578181138.0,"We had our baby in Shanghai, although quite a few years ago (2005) so some of this info may be outdated but we all lived in Shanghai until 2017, before returning to Canada.  Our experience having a baby in Shanghai was first rate and I probably have half dozen or more friends, mostly foreign or at least one foreign partner who had their babies in Shanghai.  No one had any bad experiences.  OK, if you are going to have a major operation, you may wish to return to Canada (actually I have foreign friends who have had meniscus surgery, heart stent and cancer surgery all done successfully in China), but having a baby? - pretty sure the Chinese have that down pat.

We used a private maternity floor of a public Chinese hospital, the ""Peace Hospital"" located right a Xujiahui so this made a big difference. For the first couple of doctor visits after the pregnancies, we used the public portion of the hospital. Although as you probably know, large Chinese hospitals are extremely efficient and quick and inexpensive, the experience is very daunting. You wait in line with dozens of other expectant mothers, and although our actual meet time with the doctor was pleasant, it also was very rushed. But was soooo cheap, like 10 USD visits / 3 USD blood tests, that kind of thing. In the end though, we opted for private coverage. 

The private floor was clean, quiet, cut flowers, that sort of thing. We choose their a 2 or 3 night plan, cant recall atm, which included all the labour / doctor costs for a normal delivery,  private room with attached private bathroom and a cot for the father.  Everything was first rate. Also, should mention that our ultrasound technician gave us strong hints what the birth of the baby was, so they are not so strict about that, at least with foreign parents. The doctors are of course all the same that are used for the general public, so you pay for their scheduling, environment, cleanliness, attention and English speaking.   Costs at that time were about 15,000 RMB IIRC. Chinese insurance would not cover private delivery of course. 

Our child grew up tri-lingual, attended Chinese public school for 3 years, before putting him in an international one. He is now back in the Canadian system and thriving."
