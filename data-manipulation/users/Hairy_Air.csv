I actually meant a war pick, they are longer than the one you pointed me to, so should be safer to use. Also, they are anti armour weapon so pretty good for cracking skulls and can be used as hammers."

He just wants to know how is it in the muslim community. That's the very basic question that he/she is asking. It isn't a sense of superiority but innocent investigation, with regards to common themes being circulated about muslim and hindus all around# in a safe space."

So yes the Quranic laws will be overruled just as the the laws from Manusmriti, Bible and other holy books were overruled."
