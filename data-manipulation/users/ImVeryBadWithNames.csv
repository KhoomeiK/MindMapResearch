Considering Oleander as a simple example, toxic plants are quite common and not really regulated, outside of a few specific examples.  Too many common plants are for it to be effective.

For a hilarious examples there's Rhubarb, the raw leaves of which can be fatal.

> If you can actually have said plant where you live but the plant comes from somewhere else (lets say africa por ejemplo) would you be able to “buy” a plant from there and have it shipped to you? Would you have to go there and get it personally? Ive looked into some things and imports/exports dont really mention toxicity but invasiveness etc soooooo. Would you need permission for that (toxicity) too??

Toxicity is usually not considered, so invasiveness, etc are the primary concerns.

> This is sorta plant-y but more about strict liability and ‘animal cruelty’. If one were to own said plants and kept them under literal lock and key and took every precaution but say ur pet got in somehow and were hurt or killed by said plants could you be held liable of animal cruelty? Bc i took a law class for a semester (so obvi no expert here lol) and there was this thing called strict liability where if you had a dangerous dog (for example) and you took precautions but it ended up biting/hurting someone you could be held strictly liable even though it wasnt ur intent for anyone to get hurt but u had knowledge of the danger and had tried alleviating it but obvi failed. So would something similar apply to dangerous plants??

You would probably be fine, given the list of common plants poisonous to cats and dogs is very, very long.
