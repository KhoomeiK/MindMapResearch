AskReddit,fdcq6fw,t3_ekny4d,1578281271.0,"I kid you not, it was these fancy crackers I had back in HS at a wrestling tournament. 

Backstory 

I wrestled in high school, my weight class my senior year was 125, I weighed around 145-148 lbs naturally.

One weekend we had a 3 day long tournament. This meant if I won (which I ended up doing) I’d get to move on to the next day of the tournament. They so GRACIOUSLY gave us an one-pound-allowance each day at the tournament. 

I had to make weight each day as follows:
Thursday — 125 lbs
Friday — 126 lbs
Saturday — 127 lbs

So the cracker, you might ask?

On Friday, due to my necessity to eat in order to have energy to wrestle, I allotted myself a 32 oz Gatorade, dry can of tuna, and three crackers to eat for the day...and let me tell you. Those crackers were BOMB. 

They were multigrain, in the shape of an octagon with SUN FLOWER SEEDS IN THEM. Oh those sunflower seeds. 

I guess Eddie Murphy was right"
