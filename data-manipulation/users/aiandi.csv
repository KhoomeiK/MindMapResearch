My initial reaction upon seeing the title of this post was ""how could it happen?""  When I read the article, much of it was explained by the fact that he supposedly confessed to everything.  That is, if you believe the cops.  In addition, many of his neighbors were said to have observed his domestic violence on numerous occasions.  I guess it's also possible that this is bogus testimony.

I fit in with every group and my girlfriend was into ""The Cure"" which made her a punk rocker back in those days LOL.  She even went as far as shaving one side of her head, oh my!  Nowadays that look is [quite popular](https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/half-shaved-hair-natalie-dormer.jpg) and is simply called an [undercut](https://lovehairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/disconnected-undercut-women-blonde-long-pixie-334x500.jpg).  I was very much into Black Flag, Circle Jerks, Bad Brains, and similar bands but didn't look the part.

From [12 Ski and Snowboard Mistakes You Don’t Know You're Making](https://www.visitmammoth.com/blogs/12-ski-and-snowboard-mistakes-you-don%E2%80%99t-know-youre-making)

*Mistake #3: You're sitting in the middle of the run.
Solution: Don't stop where you obstruct a trail or are not visible from above. If you need to rest or stop to wait for your slower friends, stay as close to the side of trails as possible. Go one step safer and only stop by signs or trees, which can keep you from getting hit by an out-of-control skier/rider.*

From [Rookie Mistakes](https://www.vogue.com/article/rookie-ski-mistakes-how-to-avoid-them)

*Stopping for a break mid-trail. You would be surprised by how many novice skiers stop for a break in the middle of a trail, only to be completely annihilated from behind by unsuspecting skiers mid-descent. Instead, carefully pull over to the side of the trail, where you will be free to catch your breath and snap an Instagram at your leisure.*

Many ski resorts even [post these signs](http://cdn.welove2ski.com/wp-content/uploads/California-sign@welove2ski-1.jpg) telling you not to do that.

I feel that instructors who teach such things should be fined, or at least kept out of areas where non-students are skiing/boarding.  This is another topic of discussion I'm sure."
