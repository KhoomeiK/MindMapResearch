I ended up being an atheist after I kinda realized Christianity was never my sort of thing. It felt so manufactured and over the top that I was eventually just tired of it.

For a good while I was an agnostic atheist, and then I discover Wiccan paganism. It’s what I’m comfortable with and there’s only one rule to it.

“An’ if it harm none,  do as ye wilt”

This pretty much means don’t do things that purposefully hurt others (if not in self defense), don’t bully someone or kill animals for fun or slap someone just because you don’t agree with them; just be a good person.

This is less of a rule and more of a belief, but the rule of three plays into that ‘harm none’ aspect, that the energy you put out will return to you 3 times as strong.

The only problem is that I’m often targeted for being openly Wiccan. The whole thing is we practice magick (witchcraft) but it’s never to harm anyone. We do this because we feel connected with the earth and the deities we worship."
