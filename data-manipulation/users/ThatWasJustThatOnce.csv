bipolar,ffmcm5c,t3_eu5g24,1580052408.0,"For starters, stop using screens an hour before bed. But let’s get real, this doesn’t always happen. Still try. High dose CBD (NO THC). Careful, some CBD products contain other compounds, including  melatonin. Know the ingredients, and verify the producer. CBN and CBG are becoming more available, with CBN showing lots of promise for sleep. An aromatic diffuser with lavender oil (linalool terpene) helps me drift off too.

If you won’t get off your phone/computer, at least use night mode starting early in the evening. Might not be the case for you, but blue light REALLY impacts me."
bipolar,ffm8mln,t3_eu5g24,1580050426.0,"I can’t take it, wake up in a puddle of sweat every time, even at low dose. Glad it works for you though!"
conspiracy,ffhuhrs,t1_fff0gg9,1579954503.0,"Agreed. These guys are definitely more concerned with making money than identity politics. But they are clever, and recognize identity politics has changed the cultural landscape, and thusly the market. They want to work with an increasingly diverse group of investors because they now see different perspectives as more and more valuable."
