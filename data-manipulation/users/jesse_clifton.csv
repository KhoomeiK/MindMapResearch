CasualConversation,fgvd52k,t3_f0nr8q,1581145247.0,"The short answer is no.  While it would be nice to avoid some of the mistakes, it seems to me that, given that power, we would want to correct \*every\* little misstep along the way. While that probably sounds like a good plan, you'd spend your entire life worrying about and trying to avoid those missteps and miss out on life in general in the process... and the good things that sometimes come from our mistakes.  

A series of rebellious 'mistakes' as a young man caused me to miss out on a road trip with some friends and instead get stuck going on a family vacation.... a vacation on which I met the love of my life and the woman I was married to for 35 years.  She's since passed away but correcting the speeding and general smarta$$edness which would have allowed my buddies and me to take that road trip would have caused me to potentially miss the single greatest gift in the world. Had I been asked this at 18, my answer would have probably been different, but at 60, I can tell you mistakes have value too. :)"
Jeep,fgvc7lu,t3_f0m49h,1581144190.0,Awesome.  And you had the right vehicle to do it in!

If you're doing a dough that needs a longer rise, turn on the oven light, then put the dough in and you'll get great results."

Tucson,ffpzs6s,t1_ffpdnit,1580112734.0,"Saguaro National Park East is pretty but it doesn't hold a candle to the west side.  Back in the 50's the National Park Service bulldozed HUGE swaths of standing saguaros because some were dying and giving off a black tar like substance and the powers that be thought it would spread. It doesn't. As a result the saguaro population is noting like the west.  The west side is MUCH more scenic. 

Sabino Canyon is a great place to visit and while you're on the east side, go up to Mt. Lemmon and check out the views of Tucson.  The biosphere is worth checking out. Kitt Peak Observatory is a beautiful drive and they have awesome programs.  Madera Canyon has some great hikes and is close to Tubac. It's a little touristy at moments but interesting.  The old mission at Tumacacori is worth seeing. 

As for food, there are great places all over the city.  Lodge on the Desert is a great 'date night'.  Tanque Verde Ranch (east side) has an amazing brunch. Silver Saddle is always a good choice. White Stallion Ranch (west side) is a very fun experience."

CasualConversation,fekhaqm,t3_eplrg0,1579200030.0,"I've only known this one guy who walked on water.  The rest of us will drop the ball from time to time and sometimes in spectacularly embarrassing ways.  It happens and yet life goes on.  If it helps there'll be more missteps in the future and you'll survive those too, just like the rest of us.  

Pointing out what went wrong is helpful so you can learn from your mistakes, but hounding is not. The next time he/she starts berating you, stand up for yourself.  Tell them you understand a mistake(s) was made, but continually berating you isn't helpful."
SeriousConversation,fekfzya,t3_epkkh8,1579199255.0,"I'm so sorry.  I've been in your almost exact shoes.  My mother had been on dialysis for 7 years when she came to live with my wife and I (my father had passed years before). At the time my wife was battling metastatic stage IV lung cancer. As you know there's a million things to do, appointments to make, treatments, and what most don't understand, side effects to deal with.  Mine was there in spirit, but the woman I knew was gone.  It's a really, really tough place to find yourself.  

I wish I had some grand, insightful words of wisdom for you, but I don't. I'm not sure any exist to be honest. You're on a tough road.  The best I can do is let you know you're not alone and pray for peace and strength."

CasualConversation,fekey2f,t3_eplxta,1579198629.0,"My first piece of advice is to find your local Toastmasters Club and join.  It's a great organization that will help you hone your presentation skills and be at ease while you're in front of a crowd.  

Practical tips for a speech/presentation tomorrow?  Make sure you know the material through and through.  Understand that the bulk of your audience would rather eat a shoe than get behind the podium so showing up with a smile is more than half the battle.  Remember it's just a speech, not a walk to the guillotine.  Mind your breathing; slow and steady is good for your breathing, but also for movements with your hands or walking around on a stage.  Salt the audience with a friend or two you can look to as grounding posts as you talk to the audience."

CasualConversation,fej2ixc,t3_ep1q8s,1579154494.0,"I'll offer the advice I offered my kids and grandkids. My undergrad was in economics; I retired as a chief financial controller after a string of positions with the company I went to work for fresh out of college (a rarity these days I realize).  After I retired I built houses for about 10 years because I enjoyed it.  My advice is to pick something you enjoy that you can make good money in.  If you're drawn to business, that's great.  There are countless avenues for a lucrative career in ""business"" either working for someone or as an entrepreneur.  

If nothing else, you'll learn how businesses function (and everything is a business in one sense or another), how money is made, how it's lost, and with luck how to avoid some of the pitfalls of the latter.  You may not always enjoy every second, but work to advance yourself every day, guard your money, invest well, and in time you'll be able to retire.  Enjoy life along the way, of course, but if you're diligent, when you retire you'll have the economic freedom to pursue your other less income producing passions without too much worry.  Where possible, always take the long view."

CasualConversation,fej0zs6,t3_ep60l8,1579153024.0,"I've been fortunate to live in several spots around the world in my years on this little blue marble.  My answer is almost always, YES, go for it.  Although it may seem enormous, it really is a small world after all ;)  Portugal is stunningly beautiful, the people are incredibly friendly, there's history and culture to explore, great food, and all of Europe is at your doorstep.  Go, immerse yourself, make some new connections, and explore everything you can.  Personally I think the world would be a MUCH better place if people would get our of their box and discover that no matter where you roam, people are really not that different.  Cultures, yes, but the basic goodness and desire for a better life for themselves and their family is universal.  Our shared hopes and dreams really, really are much larger than our differences.  Experiencing another culture firsthand brings that to the fore in a way you'll never forget.

CasualConversation,fej05t4,t3_ep92wi,1579152247.0,"I hope that the friendship will survive the hiccup, but in the meantime I'm reminded of the following poem I came across a long time ago that's stuck with me. I hope it helps in some small way :) 

When someone is in your life for a reason it is usually to meet a need you have expressed. They have come to assist you through a difficulty… To provide you with guidance and support To aid you physically, emotionally or spiritually… They may seem like they are a godsend, and they are. They are there for the reason you need them to be. Then without any wrongdoing on your part, or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end.  Sometimes they die… Sometimes they walk away… Sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand…. What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled… Their work is done. The prayer you sent up has now been answered and now it is time to move on.

Some people come into your life for a season. Because your turn has come to share, grow or learn. They bring you an experience of peace or make you laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it, it is real. But only for a season.

Lifetime relationships teach you lifetime lessons. Things you must build upon to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person, and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life.

It is said that love is blind, but friendship is clairvoyant. Thank you for being a part of my life. Whether you were a reason, a season or a lifetime

I lost my mama to kidney failure after 8 years of dialysis and my wife to cancer four months later.  Try not to hold anything against your teachers, or others, who clearly have no idea. As for not meeting your eyes, it's because they're afraid of being in your shoes someday. It's a visceral reminder of mortality, even if they don't realize it, and, equally important, people mean well but they really have no idea what to say... and that's mainly because there isn't really anything to say that helps.  Some people chatter away anyway or want to help because it's all they can think of."
CasualConversation,feix8p4,t3_ep8kfe,1579149724.0,"As has been said, property managers are required to keep the rental unit in functioning condition - the old adage is safe, sound, and sanitary.  If there are things broken in your apartment, you need to notify management.  Practicing a little risk management, I would advise you to telephone them or tell them in person, if applicable, and follow up in writing.  In person or by telephone in case of the water leak or something that could cause damage so they can address it asap, or at least you've given them the opportunity. A letter with return-receipt-requested will serve as Actual Notice (vs Constructive Notice) that you have an issue and expect a remedy.  If issues aren't addressed, continue to mention them, in writing.  I don't know where you live, but generally speaking once notice has been given and no action has been taken by the landlord, you can have the repairs made yourself and deduct them from your rent. You'll need to provide notice to your property manager that you intend to go down this road before doing it, you'll need to provide receipts for the work which need to be in line with an average cost for the work, and it will need to be delivered/sent to the landlord (again, return-receipt-requested so it can't be it wasn't received.  

An important note.  Property managers are licensed by the state to practice real estate. They're licensed just like the agents who help people buy and sell homes.  They can have on site management that's not licensed in certain instances, but the manager will have a license (It's possible they're unlicensed and scamming the system, but that's a pretty small group). If you really can't get any satisfaction for the issues, do a google search for \*your state\* real estate commission and give them a call.  The state handles state-law license violations and the National Association of Realtors handles ethics issues.  Search \*your city\* Board of Realtors to find your local office. Both can be helpful and both can light a fire under an uncooperative property manager.  Good luck!"
AskCulinary,feivvny,t3_epa5qy,1579148632.0,"Home cook here.  I absolutely love mine.  As said, it's mini-convection oven.  Very efficient but it's not for everything.  I have cooked meatloaf in it, roasted chicken, a chicken and rice dish I came up with, and baked halibut and salmon.  Mine gets used for cooking lot of other run of the mill stuff like and for reheating.  They're not necessarily huge, but I can cook for six in mine without much of a fuss.  

The only thing I've found it does NOT do well is cooking pre-breaded foods like fried okra as an example. It will cook it but it won't 'cook' the flour.  Also I haven't had much luck with little fried berry pies or the like.  Those need to be pan friend with a bit of grease.  As for cleaning, mine comes apart with the push of a button.  The inner basket if cooking directly on it go into the dishwasher and the 'oven' itself just wipes clean."
AskCulinary,feivar0,t3_epbdkh,1579148176.0,"I'm not sure I understand them turning ""sour"".  Can you elaborate on that?  Also, what kind of beans are you trying to cook?

As an old southener, I've eaten my weight in dried beans probably a few times over.  For everything except black eyed peas, I soak them overnight in a LOT of tap water.  In the morning I rinse them, put them in a pot, recover them with water and, depending on whether I'm on the ball or not, either slow cook them until they're done or if time is short, I'll bring them to a boil, let them cook for 5 minutes, turn the heat off and let them sit, then repeat until they're done.  

I'll add any seasonings when I start to cook them (usually just black pepper, maybe a little garlic salt, and beef stock depending on what I'm cooking, and a couple of onion quarters).   Wait until they're almost done cooking to add salt to taste.  They should come out just fine. Pair with some cast iron cornbread and send me an invite haha.  I've never used coconut milk in beans so I can't comment on that addition.

Black eyed peas cook much faster, so I usually don't soak them and the cooking time is much, much shorter. Unsoaked beans aren't poisonous, but they will take a LOT longer to cook unless you're using a pressure cooker."
