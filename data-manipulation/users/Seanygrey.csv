bipolar2,fc67fiw,t3_egc3gb,1577474002.0,"I’ve noticed there are two different types of tech in the Bay Area. Those newer companies who attract younger talent through amenities such as kitchen with free food, video game rooms, nap rooms etc. 

I, unfortunately, work with an older tech company with older business practices (manual data entry and older software). No upbeat culture like those companies, very political in career progression. I’d say asking the right questions about work life balance and stress/work management during the interview would be key. 

Hope this helps. Just my two cents, doesn’t really apply to all companies, just trends I’ve noticed working in HR."
