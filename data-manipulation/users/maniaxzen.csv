And what both the earlier poster and I were saying is that you can't get away from that. It's there whether you are recognizing it or not. You are automatically a product of your generation and period in time. You are steeped in your culture and politics. You have viewpoints that are determined through your positioning on those things. Therefore when you write, your positioning is inherently in your story/writing/plot. Whether you realize it or not. I understand how people react to politics ""forcibly"" being inserted, but that wasn't what the previous poster was saying. We're not talking about a random speech seemingly out of nowhere, we're both saying that politics are in there whether you like it or not -- and whether you recognize it or not."
FanFiction,fffj2hn,t1_fff6hit,1579885035.0,">scratches an itch books have yet to come close to touching

There's something to be said about this. I think it's like watching your favorite reality tv show or sitcom versus watching something at the Cannes Film Festival. They are just different things. I studied English Lit, so I love to read literature and literary fiction, but I read that to analyze it - I want there to be hidden meaning and things that can be taken apart to reveal something. It's like doing puzzles for fun. 

That doesn't scratch that itch that I have for fanfiction and lighter fiction though. I still want that - that's my ""I'm having a bad day and just want to curl up with a book/fic in front of the fire"" stuff. And I've found literature that does that for me (Pride and Prejudice, The Three Musketeers) but those are fewer and farther between."
FanFiction,fffimyg,t1_fff44po,1579884773.0,">a lot of it is connections and luck

I think this is the part that gets missed a lot. When I see or hear interviews of contemporary authors (not the ones that are award winning, just new authors), the chances that they 1) grew up in NYC or New England, 2) came from money, and are 3) white/male is just absolutely so much higher than the national average (even of writers). 

Anyone can write, but to get published your chances go up astronomically if you fit that description. Because you will have the right kind of connections (and you probably went to the right schools and programs to get even more connections). 

This isn't to say others don't get published, but I think a lot of the crap out there that I've read (the stuff that sounds like the person is getting off to the sound of their own voice) often comes from the above demographic. And they likely got published over someone else who wrote something better because of their connections (and probably some luck also)."

FanFiction,ffff4e5,t1_fffedcm,1579882598.0,"Absolutely although it’s changing (slowly)! Recently we found out at the college I teach at that Women’s Lit wouldn’t transfer as Multicultural Lit to the state universities because it’s finally considered mainstream.  I teach African American Lit (that was my masters focus) and I’m noticing that more of those works are being included in the general American Lit anthologies, which is really important because the “Canon” literature that gets included is really indicative of what people consider Literature. 

I think one problem with teaching is that people teach what they are comfortable with, so those things still get left out. A lot of teachers don’t feel equipped to handle the race or gender issues that come up in some works and then they sidestep them and that’s so problematic."

What I was mostly responding to in the earlier post was saying we should treat it like bias or bigotry. (I’m on a mobile so I can easily switch between the posts and it won’t let me copy the exact words). To me that meant other people should respond to that person the same as if they were treating someone with bigotry. That’s where I take issue. 

I completely agree with you that individually we should be looking at why and assessing our biases at all time. I teach research writing and I literally just gave a lesson on understanding our own biases yesterday :-). But I think we get into dangerous ground if we start judging people or treating them different for their personal sexual preferences. They need to do that work, but others need to stay out of it imo.

To your point people already judge, I’ll accept that I’m wrong about this. In the groups online (anonymous spaces so you wouldn’t know gender of person anyways) I’m in, I don’t see it, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. 

To the “at work” comment, that wasn’t an exhaustive list. I was just giving a couple of examples instead of listing every single scenario. At work is big because that would be a scenario where you might be around someone you wouldn’t normally (say you are a triathlete and all your friends you’ve met through the sport). But my example list didn’t mean I ONLY found those two examples problematic."

MensLib,ffcl2xd,t1_ffcevxf,1579801744.0,"Also, just a tip from my own experience, depending on the environment (work in particular), humor can work well when you call people out (it allows the point to be made but also diffuses the situation enough that people don't get so angry (from embarrassment) that they don't learn their lesson. My co-worker and I actually fixed our immediate team's discrimination problems through this (at least no one was saying these things out loud any more) and other teams would watch it around us after about 5 years of doing this consistently.

AskReddit,ffcc30g,t1_ffc7sjs,1579796223.0,"There are several things that need to be addressed here (I've included some links for more information):

1. Homelessness does not equal panhandling. Panhandlers may be homeless and some homeless may panhandle, but equating the two as being the same thing is inaccurate (although a common stereotype). Most people that are homeless are not panhandlers -- they are couch-surfing, living in their car, living in shelters. Some have jobs, some don't.
2. There absolutely are a few career panhandlers that make a decent amount of money off of it, but these people again are panhandlers and DO NOT represent the entirety of homeless people (or even panhandlers).
3. There is a wide variety of [experiences](https://nlchp.org/panhandling/) within the panhandling community, just like with any group there is variation and [misconceptions](https://thinkprogress.org/everything-you-think-you-know-about-panhandlers-is-wrong-36b41487730d/).
4. For most people these are the only homeless people they run into. (According to most studies, there are a decent amount of panhandlers that aren't homeless also - they may have terrible accommodations, but some actually have rooms/places to stay, and some do not). Because people see panhandlers and not the people that are staying in their car and going to work in the morning, a lot of people have the misconception.
5. There are many [paths that can lead to homelessness](https://www.streetsteam.org/causesMythsMisconceptions), and much of it depends on not having a reliable support system and safety net.
6. Your bootstrap story suggests to me that you have privileges that you aren't even aware of. Most people do not have the means or ability to just move when things fall apart. And that's great for you that you were able to get a bartending cert (I assume this cost money and time) and then get a job so quickly. (I'm not being sarcastic, that's great that you did that) But your one experience with your situation does not negate everyone else's experiences and certainly doesn't erase the statistics.

I've volunteered with several non-profits that have worked with homeless folks, and non-profits that have had a substantial amount of people that at one point were homeless. I have talked to individual people and heard life stories.

I also teach college and have a number of students find themselves homeless every year. Most are able to get themselves back on track within a few months with some help and resources, but they didn't choose to be homeless. They had housing situations fall apart while working a low paying job, they had a job loss unexpectedly, they have had all sorts of things go wrong in a perfect storm and when you don't have a safety net, it can lead to homelessness.

Not a one of my students was panhandling or doing drugs or the many things people think of with homelessness. They were using campus facilities to shower, they were sleeping in their cars or shelters. You would NEVER know they were homeless to look at them or talk to them. I knew because they trusted me and I helped them get in contact with the services at the school to help them get back on their feet. I really hope you actually read some of the above resources, or do some research on your own because these kinds of misconceptions and stereotypes about homelessness do a lot of harm in our society."

MensLib,ffc44yr,t1_ffbp7mx,1579791075.0,"I don’t think it’s true that we would fault men for problematic sexual tastes. I’m a bi woman and it comes up often in lgbt spaces that it’s okay for people (men and women) to not find trans or enby folks attractive personally as long as they aren’t excluded from the spaces or treated with bias. Personally, I have wide reaching attractions (including trans and enby folks), except light blondes. I don’t know why but male or female or enby, I just don’t find really fair people initially attractive. Now, I could still eventually fall for one given the right personality, but it just is my basic attraction. 

I think most of us have those things and while societal expectations and conditioning are likely to play into some of these (overweight women, short men), it’s unfair to say to someone you must be attracted to someone you aren’t or we are going to treat you as racist, sexist, transphobic, etc. particularly if the thing is an actual physical trait.

I think it's just situation and different for each person. If waiting works for you, great. If not, be safe. 

Additionally, I've never been one who associates love and sex. Like, yes, sex can be intimate, but it doesn't have to be and I enjoy all types of sex. So, I was pretty comfortable with (safe) FWBs when I didn't feel like dating and life was busy and there were never hard feelings (I specifically chose partners who weren't interested in dating me and I wasn't interested in dating them, but we were sexually compatible). I think waiting becomes more important if sex is closely tied to love for that person."
MensLib,fdqq3o5,t1_fdqmiap,1578672456.0,"To add to that, when I (as a woman) tried to not wait for men to make the first move, I was basically derided. Like, if even when I heard a guy might be interested in me, there was a high likelihood that me asking him out would make him feel emasculated (I would hear back through friends groups that I ruined it). If a guy wasn't interested, then he would treat me like pond scum for daring to ask him out. 

Now granted, I ended this experiment pretty quickly (this was only during college), but I basically ""learned my lesson"" about asking guys out and stopped. It never went well. And, for reference, I got asked out a decent amount (so I'd like to think I was at least moderately desirable, but I think particularly for young men still working out what it means to be a man, this can trigger too many of their own issues with masculinity). So until we fix that whole thing, it's pretty hard for women to equally ask out guys. (And maybe it's better now, this was some years ago, but it was a pretty terrible experience all around. And this derision wasn't just from the guy himself but from my entire peer group because I was breaking norms). Maybe if I was model gorgeous, it would have been different, but being mostly average, it didn't work. 

Once I got a bit older, I got a little more outspoken about this when I would hear my guy friends talking about women who did this in that way. (Guys who otherwise considered themselves feminists). We're all just so steeped in the patriarchy that sometimes it's hard to break through that -- particularly for things like dating where we're all feeling pretty insecure anyways."
MensLib,fdqp5r1,t1_fdqfvfd,1578671864.0,"From what I know, historically, the double standard is very rooted in paternity. (I'm not a historian, but I have a graduate degree in Literature where I studied a lot of medieval through Victorian lit, where this comes up a lot). We always know who the mother is, but the father could be any guy. So, in a patriarchal society where land laws and inheritance are tied to the male line this becomes a problem if they have no real way of determining paternity. So, social codes, laws, religious pressure, etc. put a high priority on women being virgins and women being faithful (obviously in a patriarchal society all the pressure and work is to fall to the women also)."

MensLib,fdqcpbr,t3_empqwg,1578663125.0,"Most of these posts are dead on, but I also want to add to this another layer. I don’t care two whits whether someone is a virgin, but in many cases when it’s come up it’s been from a fundamentalist Christian whose next move was to slut shame me (I’m female), or try to convert me, or just generally tell me I’m going to hell. So I’ve developed a bit of an association with virginity that has nothing to do with the act itself that might make me wary of someone unless I knew them well enough to know this conversation wasn’t about to go way downhill from there. (And “not all fundamentalist Christians,” and all that, but it’s happened enough to be a thing I react to now)."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fdiw8ct,t3_elk3dw,1578452448.0,"I fell out of my loft at college and gave myself a concussion. I was trying to get down without the ladder because we had a stupid H-loft where only one of the bunks could have the ladder at a time and my roommate was asleep. Wound up waking her up after all with the crash and needing to take me to the hospital for a head injury.

Edit: sorry went to bed and didn’t see all the questions. Basically the above view would look like an H with the vertical lines of the H being each bed and a two by four for added support running between them (the horizontal line of the H, although if I remember correctly they weren't in the middle of the loft, but on the ends... which would look more like an O). The ladder would lean up against that horizontal support but you’d have to move it from one side of the bed to the other (so only one person had access to the ladder at a time). L-lofts (shaped like an L) are more common. (also this was just what everyone called these lofts at Michigan’s State University like 15-20 years ago, so I have no idea what official names are)."
writing,fdhfse6,t1_fdh7na8,1578421723.0,"Eh... grades 8-12 English teachers basically work 70+ hour work weeks and then spend their summers prepping (after a short bout of collapsing from exhaustion). The pay might be terrible for editors, but teaching English is pretty damn hard at that level. They have the same class prep that all subjects have, plus they have more grading (longer and more frequent papers to read and grade than other courses). I decided to go into teaching college after seeing the nightmare that is high school English teaching.

This isn't to say all subjects aren't a lot of work, but English is particularly grueling to teach. Over time, class prep gets easier, but grading papers plateaus pretty quickly and you can't get any faster at a point (without just not doing your job well)."

In some programs and schools, you can do that for your master’s as well. I specifically chose the university I went to for my masters because I got a graduate assistantship (teaching position) and it was all paid for. My sister did the same at a different university for her masters in library science (where she worked as a reference librarian as a grad assistant). 

There are people that will pay for their PhD, but those are generally (as far as I’ve seen) not the ones getting jobs in their field after, because they often were the ones not making the cut for the GA positions and scholarships."
