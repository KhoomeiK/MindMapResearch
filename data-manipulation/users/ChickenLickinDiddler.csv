pics,ffjs6xy,t1_ffjpr9g,1580005508.0,"From what I'm seeing online you can find yourself a nice private room, with a full or queen sized bed, in a highly rated property, with breakfast included, for $15-20. So that AirBnB is a bit spendy for the region considering that extra $40-45/day could buy you quite a bit of stuff there."
Colorado4Sanders,ffexo1d,t1_ffe91zx,1579869614.0,"Nothing. They could easily just switch to Democrat as well and do the same thing. Keep in mind candidates who receive less than 15% of the vote don't receive any delegates though. That being said, as things currently look, a vote for someone like Bloomberg would likely be fruitless."
Colorado4Sanders,ffdcuym,t1_ffd0zvm,1579818193.0,Thanks! Good to know.
Colorado4Sanders,ffdct09,t1_ffd486t,1579818159.0,"To my understanding, no. You'll get it for the green party candidates and, according the the secretary of state website, 3rd parties sometimes receive nothing at all. I'd register to vote Democrat or Unaffiliated if you want to be sure you can vote for Bernie in the primaries."
FortCollins,ffcz3so,t3_eslexm,1579810234.0,"There are zero places that offer it in Northern Colorado to the best of my understanding. 


If you're hankering for quality and reasonably priced dim sum I recommend making the drive down to Star Kitchen in Denver. Dim sum is served 10:30-2:30 on week days, 10-2:30 on weekends. They're closed on Wednesdays."
Colorado4Sanders,ffcy46j,t1_ffcm6vt,1579809667.0,"Colorado did away with the caucus though. Now the primaries are like any standard election with a mail-in ballot that you can mail or drop off (and the option to vote in person of course). Also, unaffiliated voters can vote in the primaries for candidates of one party of their choice. 


Am I missing something here?"
DeTrashed,ff7bfck,t1_ff6u6s8,1579645495.0,I'm being super pedantic but New Amsterdam is more like low mid-teir vodka. I think a 1.75L is ~$17-20 most places in the US. Compare that to true bottom shelf where you can buy a 1.75L for $9-12.
couchsurfing,ff3j9xd,t3_eqyakq,1579542235.0,"I'm surfing through El Salvador right now and I'm only on day 5. I had a wonderful host the first 3 nights, absolutely incredible. There's not many, if any at all, English speakers on CS in most of the other areas of the country though. That's ultimately my fault for not knowing enough Spanish to conversate, but it's perhaps a problem you may run into as well (if you lack Spanish language skills)."
EarthPorn,fepqyyv,t1_feppx6v,1579328328.0,"I can understand some people's frustration though. During peak summer weekends you sometimes can struggle to find a place to even dispersed camp if you're an hour or two away from the front range. Of course you can still bushwhack in the National Forests and not see a single soul but as far as quick, casual (car camping) weekend getaways it can get competitive."
AskReddit,fejlugn,t1_fejl9ms,1579179267.0,Just start investing on margin and add to the pile.
FortCollins,fegpost,t1_feft0t5,1579099588.0,"I just wanted to stress how bad of an idea it is to attempt a 14er, even a class 1, in the middle of the winter without any prior experience. I strongly recommend you wait until summertime to give it a go. Good luck and have fun."
FortCollins,fe9w52r,t1_fe9qpy1,1578941956.0,"What are these $60 tolls you speak of? 470, if you choose to use it at all, is under $20 round trip even if you don't have an express toll transponder/account."
nonononoyes,fe9u2ux,t1_fe9fl7l,1578941424.0,"Can't say I remember. It was a while back and I hardly go to dispensaries. The potency was printed right on the label though, lab tested according to state law."
nonononoyes,fe94tia,t1_fe92p2v,1578934264.0,I've 100% seen marijuana in the dispensary that was 28% and there's no way they'd risk lying about that.
IdiotsInCars,fe91kf7,t1_fe91d0b,1578933221.0,"I'm talking about the comment I originally responded to saying it ""fucking blows"". Perspective goes a long way."
IdiotsInCars,fe911wn,t1_fe6qh7a,1578933035.0,Fair enough. It's also less than 2 miles long though so I find it hardly worth complaining about. How long does it realistically take to get from one end to the other? 5 minutes? It's not like commuting from Hyannis to downtown Falmouth on 28 in the summertime. Could be worse.
IdiotsInCars,fe6kq4i,t1_fe6iriw,1578894121.0,What's so bad about driving on Independence?
WhitePeopleTwitter,fe5woi5,t1_fe5vraf,1578876622.0,"That's contingent on where you live, your spending habits, how much debt you have and the amount of dependents you have (if any). 40k/year would be solid in a large portion of the US if you don't have kids and are somewhat financially responsible."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fe30mbf,t1_fe2wzpw,1578844778.0,"Invest in a travel belt bro. I've never looked back. 


Also, carry a dummy wallet with a little cash and perhaps a dummy card in case you need to bribe the police for something minor if you're traveling to areas where that may happen. Same goes for traveling to places where stick ups are possible. It's your call if you want to play dumb about only having the dummy wallet and your cellphone on you, but it could save you your passport (if you're carrying it at the time) and main money stash.


Lastly, Uber is dead in SEA. Grab bought them out and now dominates that region of the world. Prices have gone up significantly as well (no competition really, what a surprise)."
LifeProTips,fdw9us7,t1_fdw9ke8,1578756560.0,Gotcha. Glad you made it through unscathed! Be safe out there.
LifeProTips,fdw8atj,t1_fduaij8,1578756094.0,I love Longs. What time of year did this happen? Fall ascent?
LifeProTips,fdw83ok,t1_fdv1a8w,1578756019.0,Make sure it has a decent R (insulation) rating if you plan to use it winter camping. Lots of inflatable sleeping mats don't have any insulation and you'll still be quite cold once it reaches below freezing. Still better than sleeping on the ground either way though.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fdvxrp0,t1_fdvva7t,1578752952.0,"I think they meant:


1) don't have kids 

2) go traveling as much as you can"
HistoryMemes,fds0ryp,t1_fdrzm0n,1578692465.0,Not east of the Denver metro area. That's the point I was trying to make. A huge portion of Colorado is just as empty and desolate as Wyoming but you never hear people rip on Colorado for it.
HistoryMemes,fdrr48r,t1_fdrlfup,1578688400.0,"What about the Snowys? And what about entire NW corner of Wyoming, one of the most beautiful areas in the entire county? 


My point is that once you get to know Wyoming well it's pretty funny to hear about people ripping on it. Hell, I like it that way. I live in NoCo but I sure as hell would rather go somewhere like Medicine Bow NF on summer weekends while people are fighting the crowds all throughout much of Colorado Rockies."
HistoryMemes,fdretnz,t1_fdqxrpc,1578683587.0,"Wyoming gets ripped on quite a bit. Sure, there's a lot of open ""boring"" space. The same can be said about Colorado though, especially east of the Rockies which comprises almost half of its land area, and it almost never gets shit on for it."
AskReddit,fdqyi97,t1_fdqtspp,1578676792.0,"I have sooooo much Carhartt gear. It helps having a close family member who's a senior design manager. The only complaint I have about Carhartt is that sometimes their zippers fail. It doesn't happen very often, and most items I own haven't had that problem, but it's come up several time. Other than that their products are practically bulletproof."
LifeProTips,fdqr60r,t1_fdqnb8i,1578673114.0,"I know they sound callous but it really can become a serious problem. 


The downtown library in my library system is full of homeless and drifters. Many of them are respectful and are there to stay warm/cool while utilizing library resources. Others are loud, violent, use drugs and generally cause a lot of problems. Have you ever seen people get arrested in your library? People getting into fights? People passed out in the bathrooms with needles in their arms? Police patrolling inside constantly? I don't mind all the shenanigans but frankly a lot of people do. People don't want to be around that or bring their kids around that kind of environment."
insaneparents,fdqpiq3,t1_fdqmudq,1578672091.0,I understand. Those should definitely be higher priorities. Good luck!
insaneparents,fdqmi7g,t1_fdqjp90,1578670183.0,"What hub do you fly out of? Even secondary airports in the US can get flights in the $600s to major cities in India. Then once you're there you'd only have to budget ~$20/day for food, accommodation, some activities and travel insurance."
Unexpected,fdppxs9,t1_fdpo32v,1578636095.0,"I think the same can be said for anyone who has a fair amount of contact with wildlife. Unless surprised, provoked or completely desperate, there's no reason for most animals to attack you."
couchsurfing,fdp3icg,t3_emd68a,1578619132.0,"People wanting to stay ridiculous amounts of time (a couple weeks to 6+ months) come up every now and then. Sure, I'd love to have a roommate that doesn't pay rent while you ""get established"" in city that has a competitive housing market, with no job lined up and probably no money saved. Sounds like a blast.


Then there are the ultra low effort requests. Two somewhat recent ones are:


""Available tonight?"" - A compelling last-minute request made at 22:00. 


""Need a place to stay"" - Another riveting request made at 23:00, again looking for a couch that same night."
BrandNewSentence,fdk2xaw,t1_fdk1zyb,1578494754.0,I stand corrected and I will leave the comment up as a monument to my arrogance.
