Our hearts go out to those fighting the fires, suffering from loss bc of the fires, and the poor animals who have no idea what the hell is going on. We love you. Ask Everyone for what you need!"

interestingasfuck,fdqh8fu,t1_fdq0pr4,1578666606.0,"Knock that sh*t off. Or try to at least. For some, your 20s are amazing. You can run like the wind (the speed of the wind is specific to each person), drink like a fish and still take midterms the next day, sleep all day or or only sleep for 2 hours and function just fine. I had major anxiety in my 20s, but a lot of my anxiety was about things I couldn't control and/or couldn't ""handle"" but I really could. Reddit: I know that not everyone had this experience and your 20s are tough. Your young, kinda stupid and most of us had to no money (or a clue what we were doing). Some people had it tougher than I can imagine. My point is, I wish I chilled the F out back then and enjoyed it more than I allowed myself to. Have a bitchin' day (people still said in my 20s)"
