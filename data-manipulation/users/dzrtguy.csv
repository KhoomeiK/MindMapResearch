The employees pay (federal) income tax, but the rez can do 'benefits' equally to everyone and have those benefits tax free. The state and county taxes are super complicated.

I might have to trim my gas saws a little fat to keep the head cool, but otherwise it's triggers down through mesquite all day. It's not some ""tough guy"" thing, they're not there yet for our use. At the end of the day, there's no battery saw I've ever seen that will replace the MS660 we use all day for felling and logging. It could probably kick the MS240 to the curb for limbing if it didn't overheat. Hell a lot of the ""pro"" e-saws have plastic dogs..."

We came up with roughly the same thing as I was being generous and not applying a power factor, or literal+specific numbers to the equation? Watts to horsepower, you're not in a very big saw to outdo the electric one at 100% duty cycle which is a whole other can of worms in terms of how much of that 864w you get net to the chain... I'm not an EE, but I can run the snot out of a saw. I've used the big commercial e-saws and not even close to their counterparts especially if used commercially."
specializedtools,ff9sbi9,t1_ff9qvut,1579720142.0,"You must not cut wood in California then because they are killing even the new electric carb saws for commerical use. In 2021 you can't operate a diesel older than 2012 there. I cut for cell and microwave antenna installs not forestry, but we clear cut, log, and hand the wood off to sellers. We can't profit from the wood so it's a total loss. Adding the bullshit cost to new saws and batteries is a total waste of money and time. But you already knew all that and so do all the home Depot guys telling me my business.

To your torque point you're stuck on, those pieces of shit will overheat and turn themselves off so they don't catch fire before I'm worried about running out of power. Zero torque when they're overheated. There's a lot to take in to consideration when selecting tools you make a sizable investment in to keep things going."
specializedtools,ff9hp2x,t1_ff9cs9g,1579713247.0,"Hardly. The work I do with a saw requires more than a 16"" bar to do the job safely. Find me a battery saw with a 36"" bar and .050 chain. There are OSHA specs on not only **what** tool, but also **how** to use a chainsaw the same as there is for a forklift or man lift... I am required to wear chaps, and a hardhat, and eye/ear protection when I use my saw. For work. The arrogance and ignorance in this thread by home gamer armchair qb idiots in here is frankly concerning and overwhelming. Gatekeeping = following the rules as outlined by OSHA. I also use the same shit for firewood @ home. I wear all my PPE @ home too."
specializedtools,ff8g3hj,t1_ff8ebvt,1579676939.0,I was being generous. I also didn't have any resistance or heat handicaps. These 60V cells they make for mowers and shit must be 20x 18650 or a larger cell? I don't know or care. Batteries are for flashlights and starter motors.
