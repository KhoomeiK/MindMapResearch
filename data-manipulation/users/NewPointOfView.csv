explainlikeimfive,feia3fi,t1_fei9uwg,1579133684.0,"I’d say that, assuming the 5-year old understands the question, those answers are understandable for 5 year olds. But your answer explains the effect of any happy chemical reuptake inhibitor but not how it could be selective.

OverwatchCustomGames,fdmm49p,t1_fdmhklw,1578555177.0,"A control loop is just a loop that controls something in essence. But usually you’ll have inputs, like position of the hero and the position you’d like the hero to be. The output of the control loop would be the force you need to apply to get the hero to the place you want it. 

Usually a control loop requires tuning to get it right, and to adjust how “snappy” or “bouncy” the hero moves. 

One common application of a control loop is in a Segway or hoverboard. The loop would control keeping it upright. 

If you’re into that kind of thing look up PID loops, they’re the most intro level control loop (and the only type I know of lol) 

I’m sure there’s a lot more to control loops, people major in this kind of thing. But there’s a bit of the basics"
