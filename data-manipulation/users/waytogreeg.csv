socialanxiety,fcka97a,t3_ehir4w,1577720715.0,"I believe the most affective way to overcome this is to get out of your comfort zone. Yes, it is exhausting, and you might think I wish I was dead instead of socializing in some situations. But believe me it really helps you. Also later I started to care less what strangers are telling me, their critics etc.. Just force yourself to get out of your comfort zone. Our brain always want to do easy things not to use more glucose. Also you should stay away from your family friends or someone that always do your things instead of you (like talking to a teacher when you should talk yourself)"
