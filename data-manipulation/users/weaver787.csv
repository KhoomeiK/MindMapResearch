BattlefieldV,ffduptd,t1_ffdtjsj,1579829397.0,They have never added a plane or a tank as a weekly reward so the point your making isn’t applicable to this situation.
PSVR,ffda4ym,t1_ffd515v,1579816437.0,"Blood and Truth was built for PSVR so they had the move controllers in mind during the entire development. Still, I would have preferred free locomotion but I understand why they couldn’t do that"
BattlefieldV,ffd8clp,t1_ffd6b3y,1579815399.0,"I will withhold judgement until I actually see how this is implemented. The Type 2A scenario that you described is more of a weapon balance problem (it is a better weapon and therefore having it early is an advantage). I don't think many of us would care if someone was able to unlock the Boyz AT Rifle early.

One thing about the chapter reward system I do like is that isn't not going to require me to focus on doing some specific asinine thing like get 20 pistol headshots in order to unlock the gear. The path will be clear ... play the game ---> unlock the gear."
BattlefieldV,ffd38ro,t3_esw71d,1579812550.0,"Alright, so its both, so who gives a shit if you can still unlock with coin?"
PSVR,ffd30uh,t3_esx0tt,1579812423.0,"As with almost every VR title that comes out for PSVR these days, I worry about the control scheme.

God damn Sony, why couldnt you just add a thumbstick to your move controller..."
Teachers,ffcwj4s,t1_ffcvpaq,1579808745.0,"It is definitely not the same everywhere, but I do not blame you at all for feeling defeated. I taught 6 years in a shitty charter school before I found my current school which I love. The experience of teaching is largely driven by those above us and those below us, which is why I think there is such a  variety in experiences.

Best of luck to you. I hope you find something that makes you happy."

He broke the cardinal rule of Steam... never pay full price."
politics,ffcrk1u,t1_ffci7gs,1579805792.0,I always wonder if they actually believe their bad-faith arguments in this impeachment or they say them because there is literally no defense otherwise.

buildapc,ff7rizg,t3_es33jn,1579656612.0,I used to have this happen to me. It was because I had a PS4 controller hooked up via USB... when I unhooked the USB it would boot every time. So strange.
Doom,ff725hy,t1_ff6x0e3,1579639613.0,"Unless you want to be severely gimped for the later part of the game, then the upgrades aren’t exactly optional in my opinion"
Doom,ff6wpxi,t3_erzwey,1579636453.0,Nope... truly do not understand the 'it pulls me away from the ripping and tearing' argument. Looking for those damn secrets pulled me away significantly more than the 30 second cutscenes.

buildapc,fenssrq,t1_fens9um,1579290197.0,"Its pretty universal that RAM sticks should be in alternating slots... It has something to do with being able to take advantage of dual channel

Edit: Okay after 10 seconds of research I found out it is not universal. Still, check your MOBO manual to tell you how you should install two sticks if you have 4 DIMM slots."
Teachers,feneld0,t1_fekpoyl,1579283018.0,"That line seems to stem from a philosophy I heard a lot when I taught in a charter school, which is black students learn better from black teachers. It's absolute nonsense, but many admin in the inner city believe it."
buildapc,fend36x,t3_eq2evx,1579282105.0,"Looks cool, but it looks like your two RAM sticks are right next to each other. You might want to check your MOBO manual about the optimal way to install them because it might be better to have them in alternating slots."

PS4,fekbm88,t1_fek8hmb,1579196650.0,Launch lineups typically suck anyway. There likely won't be a reason for PS5 to be a must-have for the first 6 months.

Games,fek7ia0,t1_fek69w4,1579194224.0,I definitely had fun playing Exodus but oh my god the voice acting is so bad it slightly ruined the experience for me.
BattlefieldV,feihswg,t3_ep6jr0,1579138848.0,This is why I prefer playing on console. I just bought BFV for my PC a few weeks ago because it was 15 bucks and wanted to see what the experience is like... I have encountered at least 3 very blatant cheaters in just one week.

Infinites narrative is okay but I actually just really preferred the gameplay in that one.  (I'm likely in the minority in that opinion)"

boardgames,fcyix1l,t1_fcygwd2,1578080814.0,"I've learned from the replies here that we played slightly wrong. We did not know the Vagabond could trade with the Riverfolk company. Still, that probably would not have helped much.

A few problems that the game had.

- The moles and birds largely played a game of solitaire on both sides of the map. The moles controlled one side and the birds controlled the other side... they really didn't interact with one another. The birds used me as their
battle requirements

- The cards I was drawing were garbage and were not needed by either side. I guess its just luck, but the birds and moles were drawing the cards they needed by themselves. The vagabond was also handing great cards tot the birds through aid which further made my shop worthless

- Because the moles and birds werent batting, they never felt the need to use the rivers

-Again, because there was almost no meaningful battling, nobody was using my troops. Still, because nobody was buying my services, I had very little actions to take so I largely had very little troops to contribute."
boardgames,fcy044r,t1_fcxytk2,1578072785.0,Crafting. I don't remember which leader they had.... and that trading post was the 2nd building they destroyed. The birds crafted three items on their last turn alone.... it was all legal - no buildings were activated twice.
boardgames,fcxymhm,t1_fcxyeem,1578072314.0,"Yes, the birds were able hit 30 before that happened. Once the birds built 5 roosts the moles didnt want to destroy their buildings because they were banking on that turmoil occuring in a few turns. Had the birds not destroyed my trading post on that final turn, they would have failed their build decree and went into turmoil."
boardgames,fcxybh0,t1_fcxvuym,1578072138.0,"Yes, the moles and the birds were essentially playing a game of solitaire on both sides of the board. Strategically, it worked out for both of them.. the game was very close between the two but the birds ended up winning (in truth, the birds started the game so they ended up having an extra turn and they won on that extra turn.. had it gone another round the moles would have blown up points wise and won the game). The birds won on a lucky dice roll at the end of the game (they needed to roll a 3 destroy one of my trading posts which gave them the last point to win. 

I could have moved some of my troops onto the other end of the map but it really would not have have forced the birds to fail their decree. They controlled half the map so they were always within one clearing of the moles. They also always have the option of moving in a single guy and battling which would satisfy that requirement."
boardgames,fcxucoi,t1_fcxu2tu,1578070631.0,">How did they manage to influence ministers if they didnt venture out?  Something seems really off here.  I can't imagine the birds and moles never clashing.

The map was essentially split in half - with moles being on one half and the birds on the other. The moles controlled enough territory to satisfy their 'swaying ministers' requirement and the birds used my measly force to satisfy their battle requirements"
boardgames,fcxtytd,t1_fcxtri5,1578070434.0,Yes they had a card in build. The moles never battled the birds a single time... the moles just pretty much stayed on their side of the map and never ventured out... The birds just built everywhere that the moles weren't
boardgames,fcxtejf,t1_fcxsci6,1578070157.0,"I was not aware of that Vagabond rule, so yes we definitely played that wrong.

The problem mainly involved how passive the birds and moles were being. Moles literally never battled a single time in the game. The moles never needed by rivers because they were just using their own tunnels to get by. Birds never failed their decree and only had one battle card in their decree so they used my otters/beavers as punching bags. Because nobody was buying my services, I had very little funds to recoup my losses from the birds. If I wanted to set up a trading post, that only left me with a single action on that turn so I often times neglected to build in order to get more cards in my shop or get some more troops on the field. 

I definitely could have technically scored more than 4 points but at a certain point I was so far behind attempting to score more points seemed completely pointless."
