I discovered this insect in my yard yesterday. The diameter of the hole is roughly the size of a quarter, maybe slightly larger. It looks like the hole has been dug by the insect. I observed the “worm” writhing around in there, which appeared to be digging him further into the ground. You can see the freshly removed dirt pile around the outside edge of the hole. I live in the southeastern US."

So many of these comments are from people who have this same comforter. Of course I knew that other people must have it too, I just never really thought about it. Someone else posted a picture of theirs and it was so weird to see. Now I feel like we're all in some kind of club together."

Vermiculture,fd59wuk,t1_fd3pyb8,1578175530.0,"Great suggestion.

I am planning on starting another one soon. Half of my freezer is packed with kitchen scraps, coffee grounds and non-edible veggies from last year's garden (tomatoes with blossom end rot and a bunch of cucumbers that got infested with worms). I think I have enough for another bin, and I'd love to have double the compost and castings for this year's garden!

I'll do some A/B testing with the two bins and see which methods work best."
Vermiculture,fd3dix6,t1_fd2wx66,1578157224.0,"I think you’re right. I tend to do that. I’m just new to this and want to make sure my little buddies are happy, healthy and productive!

Overall, they seem to be doing well. 

I take the lid off of the bin for a little bit every day to let some fresh air in and relieve some of the humidity if it looks too wet in there. If the inside of the bin is covered in condensation and there are worms all over the walls and inside of the lid, I take that as a sign that it’s too humid in there. I leave the lid off until the sides are dry and all of the worms have crawled back into the bedding. 

They are multiplying, which I take as a good sign."
Vermiculture,fd3cnk8,t1_fd0doeo,1578156911.0,"Thank you for the thorough response.

I think I will experiment with doing a few feedings on the same side before switching to the other end, and see what happens. 

My worm bin lives inside, so I doubt the shift in weather has much effect on them. 

Great point about the celery vs. pumpkin. Celery is fibrous and doesn’t break down as easily as a pumpkin, so that adds up.

I still think there’s something to the fact that there’s simply more food options to choose from now than when I first started the bin. Also, maybe I overestimated how quickly the baby worms would grow to a size where they are noticeably contributing to the composting process. 

I guess the bin hasn’t really been around long enough to become stable. Mostly I was just wondering if my methods are somewhat conducive to developing a healthy colony. I tend to overthink things. 

Thanks again for the feedback, and good luck with your little guys!"

Perfectfit,fcb28s6,t1_fcaw8p0,1577581322.0,"This could easily be faked.

1. Cut the paper longer than what is needed to wrap the item.
2. Perfectly match up the cut edge with the design on the paper.
3. With the edge matched up, gather and pinch the paper on the opposite side of the box, then tightly fold and tape it.

You'll notice in this video that the right side of the paper is already folded in and taped to the box. And because of the camera angle, we can't see the paper on the underside of the box on the left side. I doubt that is a coincidence."
