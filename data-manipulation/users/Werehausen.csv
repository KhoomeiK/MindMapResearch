gifs,ff4caz3,t1_ff44rxh,1579560247.0,I thought maybe it would be something like that--like a quick acceleration to get it moving in the right direction before the big push. But I also agree with u/thx1138- it looks like something jettisons forward at the same time.

I use Playonmac to run HD and it works alright, but I'm thinking of running bootcamp off an external SSD (damn 128 gb internal drive) for a better experience"
