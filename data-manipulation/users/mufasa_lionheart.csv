That folder went to every class with me. Then I had separate folders for each subject (probably not as important as a teacher).

What I would probably do as a teacher is have a 2 compartment bag. Then make the kids come get it from the bag if they really wanted it back. I might even be nice enough to binder clip them together by assignment or even class if I was feeling extra helpful. I had one teacher who used milk crate type filing boxes for that exact purpose.

Eh...... probably? I'd have to dig through my notes to find the graph to say for sure though. But really, freshly bottled beer shouldn't be skunky, regardless of what bottle it's in. I have some flint(clear, but really grey, for *reasons)  glass that I will be using to bottle my own beer shortly, which will be fringe because it won't then sit in a warehouse with lights 24/7 then be put on a store shelf with lights 24/7.

But to answer your other question: It takes 9-15 MJ to recycle 1 kg of glass and 60-100 to produce 1kg of plastic from crude. 

20 oz plastic coke bottle I have because bottle deposit: 27 g, so roughly 40 per kg, so about 1.5 to 2.5 J per bottle. (20oz is perfectly fine comparison to 12 oz glass, as most of the weight is in the top and bottom of the plastic bottle, which wouldn't change) 

Glass bottle I weighed: roughly 250g, so about 15-25 J per bottle. Admittedly this isn't ideal, but that's why the idea of returnables is also important. Glass returnables could allow an energy savings of a factor of 10 or more. Yes, plastic returnables would benefit from this as well, but they are far less practical, and to even be possible would need to be much heavier than they are now (ie would require more material)."

worldnews,ff8ljrs,t1_ff8etay,1579684420.0,"Ok, I am actually deeply involved with the packaging and container industry ADHD much of what you just said is either misleading or outright false.

It is more environmentally friendly. That is a fact. Glass breaks down into sand, a naturally occurring substance. Plastic doesn't break down period. Glass is infinitely recyclable. plastics can be recycled, but degrade as you go. 

They don't have to use any chemicals to disinfect, boiling water does just fine. 

Most recycled glass is immediately broken, turned into cullet, and sorted by color (fun fact, just one bud light platinum bottle will taint an entire batch of glass pretty bad, like ""flint"" glass [what is thought of as clear] comes out a pretty vivid shade of translucent blue). So transporting intact (used) containers isn't really an issue

>as it degrades

Literally what? Glass doesn't degrade..... also, if it did get discolored, you melt it down and make a new container, then all the organics would burn off.

As for paper vs plastic: you are kinda right, but ""U.S. EPA statistics show that paper bags are recycled 5 times more than plastic bags."" And while that isn't the end all solution, I will point out that plastic isn't infinitely recyclable, after a very short lifespan, the polymer chains get too short to be useful, at which point what do we do with them, whereas when the cellulose fibers get too short to be off use, they are carted off and spread on a field as fertilizer, because pair is biodegradable."

I mean, kinda? I forget the exact number, but I'm pretty sure it was about 70% energy savings to recycle glass compared to making it from scratch. And it isn't that energy intensive at all, especially with most of the glass plants putting solar up and they've been wholly electric for a while now.
