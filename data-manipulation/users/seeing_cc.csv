AskReddit,ffdt7cg,t3_et0l34,1579828319.0,"I've spent more than a week in the hospital a good few different times over my life. I have wicked bad asthma, it was worse when I was young and there wasnt alot of different medicine for it, id be in for multiple days at least 3 or 4 times a year. The longest was 12 (it may have been 15 split between 2 hospitals I'd have to ask my mum lol) days in boston children's hospital.

It wasnt to too bad when I was in as a kid, I was lucky that the hospital near where we lived knew me really well, they had TVs in all the rooms and a little room at the end of the hall with VHS tapes and the nurses would always buy a bunch of Italian ice and keep it in the nurse breakroom fridge for me because it was the only thing id eat lol there was a childrens room with toys and games and stuff too.

The downside was I usually wasnt allowed out of my bed except to use the bathroom and even then I'd have to buzz the nurse to help with my iv pole and have a nebulizer treatment and oxygen waiting for me because it was to much on my lungs. Spending days and days and days in bed sucksssssss you start to feel gross and hot and greasy and even if your allowed to take showers or baths you dont really feel clean because it's hard to wash with one hand wrapped so your iv port doesnt get wet. And even then your not using your towels or putting on your clothes n u still just feel gross.

By far the hardest thing though was being so sick all the time I was absent from school more then i was actually there (luckily i was hella smart and would do all my work at home or in the hospital and never had to stay back) I'd be out so much i never had close friends and sometimes people would forget me altogether. One of my most crushing childhood memories was in 3rd grade we had a competition to see who would illustrate the cover for our classes little mini yearbook. The kid in my class who was the best at drawing drew this really detailed cover with a little cartoon drawing of everyone in our class (Massachusetts class like 25 kids) the drawings were so detailed, everyone was in clothes and shoes they actually wore, in groups with their best friends. Everyone voted for it and we all stood around so excited. I scanned it three times before I realized I wasnt on it. I said where am I? He said idk I guess I just forgot you were in our class. It took everything I had not to cry, I asked the teacher if she could let him add me in. She said no. It won and I wasnt on it. I hated that stupid fucking yearbook and the kid that made it for years. I dont think he did it on purpose but I'm weirdly still sad about it damn bear 20 years later lol

As an adult I'm alot better and I havent been in the hospital for a couple years at least, last time was 5 days. It sucked for similar reasons, it was over the same week as Thanksgiving and my daughter had to go to her dads and stay with him and his gf, they brought her to see me for maybe 10 mins. None of my family came or called and when I called them they were to busy. My bf at the time swung by for just enough time to start a fight (I asked him to stay the night w me because I was allowed an overnight visitor, and he refused because he had a raid with his WOW guild that night. He called me selfish for trying to take him away from people who needed and depended on him and then he took my car and I didnt see or hear from him again untill I got out a few days later).

So I'd say all in all there are alot of shitty things about being in the hospital, I never particularly missed the outdoors because I'm allergic to nature and it makes me sneeze and wheeze lmao mostly you miss your home, your bed, your clothes, your shower, privacy, sometimes the food sucks, you feel nasty, and it's boring as fuck.

But overall I'd really have to say that the absolute worst thing about being in the hospital is the isolation. You will never feel more alone, while simultaneously being surrounded by people, in your entire life then you will in an extended stay in the hospital."
