mbti,ffxsc2w,t1_ffxfn0q,1580331451.0,"This is a good example. I think a better example is in basketball. If you are right-handed you will prefer to dribble and shoot with your right hand. But if you want to be the best you can be, you learn to dribble with your left hand, and you learn how to shoot left-handed layups. So you do a lot of practice to get more comfortable shooting left-handed layups and dribbling left-handed for when the defense gives you the left side of the goal. 

You are still right-handed and you will probably always be able to dribble and shoot better with your right hand. So on a fast break, you will naturally prefer to dribble down the court and shoot a layup with your right hand. And when you shoot a medium field goal or 3-pointer, you will always use your right hand.

Edit: Forgot to mention switch hitters in Baseball. Sometimes switching hands gives you an advantage based on the handedness of the pitcher and how the defenders are shifted or positioned."
mbti,ffxrmtr,t3_evpfyl,1580331061.0,"Think of a really good actor. They have their own idiosyncracies, traits, and habits that reflect their natural behavior. As they jump from role to role, they suppress their natural habits and adopt the habits of the character they are performing. Their natural habits and tendencies are still their default and very much part of them, but they are able to not rely on the default.

The same is true of MBTI. If you are ENFP and you want to solve a problem. You might ask a lot of questions, but you will really try to Feel what is going on and come up with a solution that way. Let's say you get thrown into a job that is just 99% numbers and data. You can get really good at using data and available evidence to solve problems. Does this mean that you have somehow changed into an ENTP? No, you are still hardwired to be a feeler, but you have developed the ability to use a function that you were not naturally prone to use. If taken out of this environment you would go back to feeling as your preferred function instead of Thinking. 

The most well-rounded people are the ones that knows how their MBTI type has their brain wired, know the strengths of their type, and know their types of weaknesses. They then work on improving their weaknesses so that they can perform better if the circumstances required that they must do something that is traditionally uncomfortable for their type. No this does not mean they change, they still prefer to act like their brain is naturally wired, but they are able to handle challenges as they come up like an actor who performs different roles very well."

Put the ball in their court. A lot of times when there is a wedding, the fued/fight/rift makes it seem like some family members will not be likely to show up. Most of the time, the people in question are not even invited to the wedding. But the thing to do is to always invite the people that you are fighting with if they are important to you. This changes the narative of you not inviting them and you being the bad guy to you inviting them and putting them on the spot. If they come, then they must care about you more than the dispute. If they do not come, then you tried and it is on them. 

We all know that moving in with someone is no reason to abandon someone. You should actively do what you can to try to maintain ties with your family. Doing this will constantly put the ball in their court and force them to think about maintaining their absurd world view or potentially losing all contact with you.

Ideally, they will spend time with the two of you and get to know him better and realize he is a good person, that he makes you happy, and that they are acting childish. Or they will severe ties with you. Either way, you hoped and tried for the best. If the relationship with your family ends at some point, it is because of them and you can have a clean conscience.

Plus we just drafted mecole hardman so we have him for a few more years on a rookie deal and we will probably extend him when the time comes.

Watkins often gets lost in the conversation when people talk about the chiefs. Sure he could go to almost any other team and be the number one and get more targets and yards. But he has a history with injury. If he stays here and is always the 2nd or 3rd option, his risk for injury falls and he never has to go against number 1 corners.

Ideally we will draft a linebacker, running back, and o-line in the first three rounds of the next draft without trading up. I think veach can pull an elite running back out of the third round for us that nobody saw coming like Hunt. The real question is if Veach can find an overlooked inside linebacker in the second round (we basically have 2 second round picks with our late first round pick). If we I could also see us getting some more quality depth at offensive line. I like Erving when he fills in at guard, but he struggles when we put him at tackle.

If you give us a tough running back that can lead the league in rushing, and you give us solid inside linebacker play with mahomes and our current team, we would have a stranglehold over the rest of the AFC and the entire league for the next 5 years.

When she broke up with you, you had no idea why. It was early enough in your relationship that you still had her on the pedestal and had not learned enough about her to think any less of her. But then she broke up with you. Then she talked with her ex. Then you asked her to try again and you started dating. Then she told you everything that happened.

What I see here is two young people dealing with maturity and relationship experience. 

She should not have started a relationship so soon after breaking up with her x if her mental health was compromised at all. She should take that as a lesson and remember it going forward. 

In the future, if somebody breaks up with you, or rejects your request for a relationship, you should move on and never pursue them again (unless they refuse your request because they are in a relationship and eventually become single in the future after they have had time to recover). If someone rejects you and you keep asking, you appear desperate. You should have enough self-respect to only date people that respect you and want to date you.

Meaning if someone is willing to break up with you or reject you initially, they see something they don't like about you. You shouldn't have to change yourself or beg them to date you. You should move on and find someone that respects you enough to give you the relationship you deserve. The more time you spend begging this person, the more time you could have spent finding someone that would have not broken up with you after 2 weeks.

basically, if you keep chasing girls that reject you or break up with you, you look desperate and you are wasting time that you could be focusing on people that would respect you.

You subconsciously realize that if she did respect you, she would not have broken up with you, and she probably would have taken enough time to get over her ex before starting to talk to you or move close enough to you to start a relationship. To me, this is why you don't feel that spark that you initially did. You know that she didn't feel that spark initially or she would have never ended it in the first place. Take this as a learning experience that when you are talking to a girl in the future, be wary if she just ended a relationship. Jumping from relationship to relationship without time to recover is a huge red flag and is something that can indicate a person is not stable. 

You can try to ride it out if you wish, but I honestly doubt it will get better, I think you are still stuck on the initial idea of dating her that you had before the first 2-week stint instead of actually dating her after the breakup. 

I once was crazy about a girl for a year or so. We talked a lot and she kept leading me on. I would ask her out and she would friendzone me, then hook up with her ex. I was crazy about her, so I would find a way to justify it. Well, eventually I realized that this was bullshit.  The ex went off the deep end and hurt her. She then tried to ask me out and be with me. I was already over her and rejected her. Since then I took on the attitude where anyone I ask out or date gets one chance. if they say no or break up with me, I will never date them again. 

I have been with my wife for 6 years now. Had I wasted time on every girl that rejected me or broke up with me, I never would have found her. And when you do find the one, you will know it and wished you found her sooner."

If he rejects any attempt to seek treatment, you would not be on the hook for his well being any longer. That is on him at that point. You sould leave him.

He is not going to get better without treatment, and treatment and how he responds is up to him. If he refuses to apply himself, that is on him.

Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't that how selective breeding works? You take samples from the population that show certain traits or have stronger features and you breed those to make the traits and features stronger in the next generation?

Maybe the first people to attempt to domesticate wolves selected the pups that were more docile and playful to breed simply because they were more inquisitive and not as threatening when they grew into adulthood? I mean we put down dogs today that bite people. I can only imagine what a pure-blooded wolf would do to a person if they decided to bite them. Surely these wolves would have been put down before they had a chance to pass on their genes while the gentler ones that were more likely to play fetch would have been kept as pets and had the opportunity to breed future generations??

If you share a bank account, open one up in your name that you can trnasfer half of the money into. Be sure to keep digital copies of the bank statements to prove you only took half. You want to do things like this to keep him from destroying your credit and savings after you break up. Plus having a place to stay will prevent you from being forced to live with him.

The third thing you should do is understand that you are not compatible with eachother and that just because you have 6 years invested in him does not mean you have to stay with him. Those years are over. If you are hating the way you feel because you are are ina relationship with him, you need to end it. 

Ideally, he will get professional treatment to manage his depression to where he is no longer at risk for taking his life. Ideally, this is when you should break it off. If he refuses this treatment, you should leave him immediately. Otherwise he could always threaten suicide to keep you under his control. At this point, you would only be enabling him to not get treatment and you would only be making the problem worse, you would not be saving his life by staying.

relationship_advice,fekq8s3,t3_epo9zp,1579205359.0,"It sounds like a ""grass is always greener"" type of situation. You probably thought she was exotic or different than other girls for some reason. As a result, you pursued her and started dating her. Now that you are dating it seems like she isn't as special as you thought??

Maybe you put her on a pedestal or held her to a higher standard before you started dating. In other words, the idea of dating her was stronger than actually dating her. 

In my experience, dating is just a checklist to find the person you will eventually spend your life with. Every relationship starts off with a high. You have someone you are attracted to and probably share interests with. As you spend more time with that person, you find out more about them and you either discover something that is a deal-breaker (ie they are fucking crazy, they cheat on you, they are not a good person, they are manipulative, or you just are not compatible). This typically takes around 2 years or so ( I am basing this on a study that I read where people that dated for 2 years before getting engaged/married had much lower divorce rates compared to people that got married earlier than 2 years. The idea is that people are on their best behavior early in a relationship and they can often mask their real behavior. So the more time you spend with them, the more their mask breaks down to reveal who they really are. After about 2 years of dating someone, you would probably have a pretty good idea about who you are dating and have probably seen how they have reacted to stressful and challenging events that occurred during that time.)

The reason I bring this up is because it sounds like there was the initial attraction in your relationship, so you started dating. Now it seems that you might not be as attracted to her as you initially were. Maybe you have already started seeing things differently and she is not as ideal as you initially thought? Sometimes relationships just don't work out, even between 2 good people. Not every relationship is able to work.

It is pretty normal to notice other attractive people besides your partner. As for sexual dreams, I am not sure the significance of no longer dreaming about her. How long have you been dating?"

>Last March, he cheated on me with a girl we went to high school with. I caught him in the act. He said he wanted to stay in our marriage, but he felt like I was neglecting him emotionally because I was always wanting sex. We talked, discussed our needs, and tried to heal.

So you are telling me that he felt neglected because you only wanted sex, so his answer is to have sex... with somebody else??? That seems like bull shit. I don't think he is attracted to you anymore. I can understand mental health impeding sexual activity, but why would he sleep with someone else if that is the case? 

I think the marriage should have ended in March. He never should have cheated on you. That is inexcusable. I think he is not attracted to you anymore, and he slept with this other woman, got caught and blamed it on the PTSD. For all you know, they could have been involved for the last 2 years when he started to pull away from you. 

>My husband has noticed me being gone more and more, and finally realized he needs to step up or I'm going to leave for good. Yesterday we started marriage counseling, but as soon as we got home he went back to the sob story of him being neglected or being to blame for the lack of sex. I don't know if I have the energy to work toward a better marriage after trying so hard for almost a year. But I also don't know if I have the energy to leave him.

If he was so concerned with you leaving, he never would have cheated on you in the first place and he would have been open to marriage counseling and psychology before he cheated on you. It seems like he is just trying to keep you to stay so he can leach off of you or control you.


> I also fear if I leave, he will give up all together and commit suicide.

This is tough. You can't let this control your life though. I wouldn't stay because infidelity is a deal-breaker. He should be seeing a therapist. The fact that he has refused to do this so far shows he doesn't want to try and get better. If he doesn't want to get better, he will use the threat of suicide to control you forever. If someone doesn't care about helping themself and they disrespected you by cheating, why the hell are you still with this guy? You need to end it."
excatholic,fekff3r,t3_ephxjv,1579198909.0,"Honestly just read various philosophical stuff that makes you feel uncomfortable and challenged. You don't need to join a cult to know what is right or wrong. Just follow your conscience and be willing to read, appreciate the merit, and think about views that are different from your own. This will keep you from becoming complacent (like most Catholics and religious people are) and you will always seek ways to better yourself.

For me, this addresses the issues with religion and gives me resources to supply what religion actually should be trying to do. 

For me, religion should be about making the world a better place by starting with yourself. 

For me, the problems with religion are:

1. the goal of religion is to make each person follow the religious doctrine, which may actually be harmful to that person or violate their conscience. For example, the catholic church will tell gay people that they are sinners and that they are not correct. So gay people that grow up in the church often have some sort of identity crisis or mental issues because they have never been accepted for who they are.

2. The political structure of organized religion is more harmful than helpful. Man is a political animal. People will almost always act out of their own self-interest first. Sure there are a lot of priests that have died around the world for standing up against various oppressive political regimes, but most priests and bishops do not have this mindset. Instead, they focus on protecting the church and doing whatever they can to move up the ranks. So you have priests and bishops that ignore abuse because it would damage the church. You have clergy endorsing politically convenient politicians.

You can stop this by voting with your time and money. Stop supporting churches and organized religion with your cash and time. Read and volunteer with actual charities that actually have the primary goal of helping people first (instead of churches whose primary goal is to protect the church and grow before helping others).

But when in doubt, follow your conscience. I would recomend reading excerpts from Adam smith's theory of moral sentiments. He talks about when you see someone in pain, you think about what that pain would feel like if you were that person. As a result you pity them as if you were in pain. If you follow your conscience but also feel empathy towards others as an impatial spectator, you will be able to know how to act in all situations. You don't need a xenophobic set of outdated rules preached to you by pedophiles to know what is right. If the church taught people how to think, the church would stop existing. But as long as they have a stranglehold on people by gaslighting them, the church remains relevant and empowered to be a shit stain on the world..."

This is how they get you. In order to get married in a catholic church with a priest, you have to go through catholic brainwashing classes and receive the various sacraments. it's not like the church will just let you rent out the building and the priest for an hour or so to get married, you have to basically become catholic to have a catholic wedding.

What you and your fiance should do is figure out what kind of wedding you want, how much it will cost, and who is going to pay for it.  I have seen parents offer to pay for weddings, but put qualifiers on the wedding. ""We will pay for the wedding, but you have to do it catholic.""

So figure out what kind of wedding you want and how much it will cost. If someone offers to pay for it and there are qualifiers that you don't agree with, then you need to find the money somewhere else, pay for it yourself, or come up with a less expensive wedding.

&#x200B;

If I were you and your fiance, I would not do a catholic wedding because neither of you are catholic. If this is what you decide to do, then a conversation needs to be had with his parents. Your fiance needs to be direct to his parents that you both are not catholic and that the wedding will not be a catholic wedding. Odds are they will try to guilt-trip him into agreeing because they raised him and gave him a good quality of life. That is probably true, but he is not obliged to follow a religion that he does not believe in. You need to be there to support him, but he should be leading the conversation (as you would do if the issue was with your parents).

&#x200B;

You both basically want to put the ball in their court. In other words, tell them the wedding will not be catholic and it will be on X date and time. Invite them to come. If they are that torn up about it, they don't have to come. This is a difficult conversation to have, so have your husband be firm, but not a dick when he does. This might piss them off, but it should get them to realize if they want to share this special day with their son, they will have to give up their dream of a catholic wedding. If they decide they won't show up, they risk ending a relationship with the two of you.

I was raised catholic and went to public school my entire life. I played sports and earned a football scholarship to a small catholic college near my home. The college had a great reputation and a great success rate in alumni finding jobs. 

&#x200B;

I figured I was raised catholic so I should be able to do fine there. Well, I thought I was raised catholic. Like I mentioned before, I was raised catholic, but I went to public school. My church where I grew up had a lot of Hispanics that migrated here (half legally and about half illegally). So we had masses offered in English and Spanish. As you would expect, the priests we had were bilingual and had spent a lot of time in various parts of Latin America. So the priests I had been exposed to growing up understood the implications of genocide (backed by America) that have occurred in that region since the 1980s. As you would expect, the priests I grew up with were more liberal and probably all voted against trump.

&#x200B;

So I get to college early with all the other fall athletes to start practicing for our various sports. I would say at this point, half the people there are catholic. Of the Catholics, I would say over half were similar to me, grew up in the suburbs, went to public school, went to church on Sunday, etc. I would say 1/3 were rich and went to private school. Of the non-catholic athletes, most went to public school and earned sports scholarships.  

&#x200B;

For two weeks everything went great. Then the general population of students showed up. The athletes made up 1/2 of the school. The non-athletes made up the other half. Of these nonathletes, 95% were Catholic, and of the 3/4 were hardcore conservatives that want to repeal Vatican 2. I would say that 15-20% of the college was homeschooled growing up.

I thought I was catholic, but these people treated me like shit because I didn't want things to go back the way they were in the 1950s. You had women wearing veils to mass, you had people trying to get mass said in Latin, and you had people that would kneel down and basically kiss the floor before they took communion.

I missed a few days of classes to go to the wedding of a family member (who is gay). I came back and these holier than thou Catholics treated me like shit because there were pictures on facebook of me at this wedding and smiling with the couple. I realized that for people that claimed to be living like god, they wouldn't know jesus if he kissed them on the cheek.

I decided that I was done with the catholic church. Unfortunately, i didn't have the finances or other options to go to a different college. The other two colleges that offered me scholarships had new coaches, so I couldn't transfer to them my sophomore year. Plus I didn't play my freshmen year, so I had no game film to send to other coaches. I stuck it out and tried to make the best of my situation.

&#x200B;

And here is my advice to you. I would encourage you to work your ass off in your classes and ignore the haters. It sounds like this is a very prestigious high school. If you get good grades and smash your test scores, you can open up a lot of options for college. This does 2 things. 1 it will allow you to go to a state school (where you will be in the majority with other atheists). 2 you will get out of your parent's house and can escape their attempts at indoctrination.

I went on to get my master's degree at a state school and it was a breath of fresh air. I did a lot of reading while I was getting my undergrad.

As you already know, most Catholics that treat you like shit are only following the herd mentality of thinking they are in the majority (because most of them have only ever gone to private school and been forced to go to mass every day for their entire life). You should arm yourself with the knowledge and resources to show how these people are not following all of the doctrines and just cherry-picking what is politically convenient to them. But here is the most difficult thing, don't argue with them. Even if you win the debate, they will think they are the winners because of the herd mentality. If you fight with them, you just put a larger target on yourself. Just teach yourself how they are wrong and how you can be a better person by studying something you don't believe in in order to understand why you don't believe it and to understand how it is being abused by the people that claim to follow it.

I will say if you get in the habit of studying something you don't believe in, you will be stronger because of it. Most people simply follow what they agree with (as I am sure you can attest to). The people that are most successful in life are used to doing the hard things and can deliver in the face of adversity. So focus on your grades (even your shitty theology classes). Go through the motions with your mom (even if it means sitting through mass). But focus on yourself and get into a good college and get the hell out of there in 3.5 years.

I would encourage you to start reading Rerum Novarum. It was an encyclical written by Pope Leo XIII in the 1890s as a response to the growing popularity of socialism. He basically says that capitalism at that time was extremely ruthless (remember there were no labor laws and labor unions) so people were turning towards socialism. He says that Marxism is bad because it takes away the right to own private property. He also says that unbridled capitalism (ie liberalism or modern-day libertarianism) is also wrong because it alienates too many people. The funny thing is that virtually every pope since has issued an encyclical repeating this. But most hardcore Catholics ignore it or have never heard of it. Instead, they focus on gays and abortion while preaching for regressive tax brackets, no refugees, and no labor unions while all of these things are encouraged by catholic doctrine."
