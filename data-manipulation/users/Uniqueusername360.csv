Here are some incredibly important and relevant links. Please be sure to read. Condoms are only an average of 85% to 98% effective at preventing the spread of STIs like HIV. 


“However, condoms don't protect you from all STIs such as herpes, genital warts and syphilis which can be spread from skin-to-skin contact.”

""Also one month after beginning the treatment interruption, his 44-year-old female partner had fever, joint pain and a skin rash – symptoms that are suggestive of acute (very recent) HIV infection. She was subsequently diagnosed with HIV and phylogenetic analysis showed that her viral strain was very similar to that of her partner.

The only sexual behaviour the couple reported to doctors was cunnilingus (not usually considered a risky act) on two or three occasions.""

You can still contract STDs from oral or while having sex with a condom. So be very careful with who you sleep with. Many people with fatal and transmissible illnesses could not care about your well being in the slightest. So be careful.
