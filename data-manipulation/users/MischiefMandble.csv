Listen, I can tell you think I'm that special kind of morron you only see on reddit, but understand that I have multiple degrees and a doctorate of which I am drawing from to make this argument. I'm not just talking nonsense; I am trying to explain how the bodies orientation would not contribute much to how easily your poop will flow.

AskReddit,ffdcp9n,t1_ffdbwkp,1579818093.0,"That's why you seem to be misunderstanding my point; gravity hardly does anything to help your digestion ( look up peristalsis) which is why all my points are revolving around the RELATIVE position of your hips and knees. I'm saying that you could be doing a squatting position standing on your head, and the idea that you relax the muscles around your sphincter would still be true"
AskReddit,ffd9hov,t1_ffd8e9d,1579816056.0,"One is a consequence of the other. Unless you are implying that there is a requirement for gravity to be working with you therefore you must be sitting upright instead of leaning forward, then I am telling you they are the same thing!"
AskReddit,ffd68mm,t1_ffd405s,1579814224.0,"That's because you're thinking that I mean your knees are literally UBOVE the hips, but I'm talking about position relative to other body parts.

The premise of the squatty potty is that it relaxes some muscle that would otherwise inhibit your flow. The stool is used to move your feet up, reducing the the angle your legs make with your torso, and relaxing the muscle. 

What I'm saying is that if you lean forward, you reduce that angle in the exact same way. When I say your knees are above your hips, I mean in the sense that your head is at the top of your body, and your knees are closer to your head than your hips I.e. relatively speaking, they are above the hips"

If this is their intention (sometimes they might be genuinely curious), they will probably believe that morality comes from God and that there is no other explanation. They pose the question hoping to get us to realise that fact. The problem is, as it often is, that they've fallen prey to circular reasoning where they assume that morality comes from God, and so are using morality to prove that God exists.

I think the question becomes more interesting if you get to the bottom of why it's being asked, because we can then start talking about why their assumptions on the subject are flawed"

AskReddit,fenwh7x,t1_fenqd9h,1579291886.0,"Think about it: the passwords change all the time, probably as a safeguard for letting others in! Spoken passwords are always going to be insecure. The point is moot as to whether or not they're *allowed* into the other persons common room because anyone can over hear a password anyway. Basically, if a student wants to get in to cause mischief, they can probably get in whether they're allowed to or not. 

So Harry's broom was still unsecured, it still could have been anyone who entered the room, same with the diary.

It still doesn't matter whether malfoy was in the common room or not because the point of that plot thread was that they had to trick malfoy into talking to them; being in the common room wasn't necessary, being disguised as crab and goyle was the necessary bit. 

A slytherin could help Sirius in the current system by eavesdropping. Separate from that, though, you're implying that a Slytherin was friends with a Gryffindor, was let into the Gryffindor common room (thus hearing the password), and then decided to give a murderer access to the place their friend sleeps? No! Sirius might get in, but he's not going to get in because someone willingly gives him the password!

None of these counter my original point though, which was that harry could have just been friends with a Hufflepuff and visited them; Harry breaks tons of rules, and this is probably a very minor one. Besides, who would know? It's not like the house heads ever come into the dormitory!"
AskReddit,fennc76,t1_fenh386,1579288123.0,"All these plot points would still work if only Gryffindors were given the password and only let their friends in: Harry knows it was a Gryffindor (or a guest of a Gryffindor) who stole the diary; Harry stashed his broom in a place where only a Gryffindor could allow access to; Malfoy would never invite Harry and Ron into his common room anyway, so that plot point remains the same; Justin Finch-Fletchly hiding was a Hufflepuff, so Harry could have followed him into his passworldless common room anyway -- he  just didn't want to, so that ""plot point"" is unchanged; no one was even going to give sirius a password, so that isn't changed; Neville still forgets the passwords; and I don't remember the thing with Carrows, so I can't comment

Sure, they *could* meet somewhere else, but I don't see why that's a reason for why they *can't* meet at in their common rooms.

Firstly, how would a person sabotage the house cup by sneaking into someone else's common room? Teachers are the ones who give out house points, and they hardly visit the place.

Secondly why would it matter if it did happen? Unless it affected the plot, it probably doesn't matter whether people sabotaged other houses all the time. Maybe it already dose happen and we don't hear about it.

Thirdly, and most relevantly, completion can still exist when other houses are free to visit. This is a question  about who JK could have written the book to allow Harry to visit other common rooms. She could easily have written it so that pupils were allowed to mingle without having to sacrifice the idea that they were competing for the house cup!"

atheism,fena4jf,t1_fen1uaw,1579280277.0,"What you've just described is the mental anguish caused by demanding belief, which isn't what I'm describing at all. I (and the OP) described indoctrination,  which is different.

Obviously it isn't a one to one comparison, but the differences aren't really relevant to my point. If you support a football team, you go to matches, you watch their games regularly, you talk about that ludicrous display last night, you cheer when a goal is scored, you cry when your team loses, etc etc. If you raise a child and the child is witness to that behaviour, they will start to think that team x is the best team; they will start to think that the other team sucks; they will start to think it's a common and normal practice to watch tv on a specific day of the week. That's indoctrination.

Similarly with religion, a parent goes to church every week because that's just what they do. They have to bring their children along because they can't leave them at home. The kids are exposed to prayers and singing and stories, and it just becomes the norm for them because they are exposed to that sort of behaviour"

Let's flip the question upside-down and see if it still makes sense to you; why wouldn't you teach your children that the earth is flat? You wouldn't because you honestly think it's an incorrect model of the earth.

An abused child who wanted to keep his head down would just allow himself to be pushed and hope it would stop eventually.

He was always quite head strong, though; he discovers Fluffy in the philosopher's stone because he was goaded into having a duel with Malfoy out of hours. Again, that doesn't seem like the type of behaviour that an abused boy would do, but it is the type of thing you might expect of a person who visits other common rooms just 'cos"
atheism,femuamm,t3_epxl7l,1579269784.0,"I find it hard to agree completely with this because it's hard not to indoctrinate kids into something just by being yourself.

That way they'll probably come to understand better how a sequence of discoveries build up over time to form a theory.

The ""where did the water come from?""

If you want to argue against that type point, you have to go really deep and ask them about why they think it's possible for God to be so powerful? Why can God create something from nothing, but animals can't change very very slowly over millions of years (which seems like something that's much easier to do). The key is always ask questions.
