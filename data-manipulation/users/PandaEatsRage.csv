AskReddit,ffeejsg,t3_et0asi,1579845056.0,"It was my ex. The relationship was going good for a long while, and during the 'creepiness' of it I didn't even notice till after we ended it how bad it was. One of the things she always liked about me was the way I dressed. I took care in how I looked but nothing I would consider overboard. I would call it routine normal guy stuff +10 minutes a day. She especially liked the way I dress and a specific clothing line in my country.  They had different series of clothes, T line, F line, etc., with unique but specific styles/look. They had vastly different price points, looking back it may have just been the money on them? She would sniff me occasionally at first, normal cute girlfriend things or I thought. Liking my smell, my cologne,  when you're in love those things become comforting. It was casual during cuddles, or dates, and then it would become more frequent and often. 

She would clutch me more often, put her head onto my shoulder, run her fingers along my shirt and sniff. Noticeable but fine until the frequency ramped up and family would even make comments. I talked to her about it and she had curbed it. She then would make requests of what I should wear even though she liked what I wore before. It wasnt like we were shopping and she was picking stuff out, just picking stuff I already owned. She would normally ask me to wear the more expensive S-line of clothing I owned even for more casual things like lunch at a cafe, or visiting a friend. This was all still pretty ok until we would go out shopping and constantly ask me to buy some clothes she picked out. I would try them on, she would rub me, run her fingers over the clothes, sniff me, and make sexually suggestive type ideas and motions and in the heat I would buy them. 

It just got worse as time went out. The weird stuff became the norm, no friends or family mentioned the sniffing because she was more discrete with it and heck, what she likes is what she likes. My company went through some changes and I had to take a big salary cut to stay on board. Jobs in my field arent readily available in my country so I didnt have too much a choice. I tried to save money when and where I could. I told my girlfriend about it and she understood and was so patient with me. Except in the field of my clothes, my nice clothes were getting a bit worn over time and I replaced a few of them  on my own without telling her trying to save money. I'll admit I kept this from her because I was brow beaten? I wouldn't say it was abusive yet, or she wasn't. Just controlling in this one area. A couple weeks later and we were crawling into bed and she was sniffing and fingers running over me and she stops and asks why Im wearing the F series clothes. I don't know why but I said no no they weren't they changed a few things these were the more expensive ones like she like. She fucking flipped. It was night and day on, off. She slapped me. I was shocked I stared at her holding my face. She grabbed my hair and pulled my head down and grabbed the back of my shirt. She lifted it and flipped up the labeling on the collar and said ""No it's not you fucking liar. There's no Series-S Tag"""

dndmemes,ff9lxn3,t1_ff9ljeb,1579715766.0,Different personalities different roleplay styles. Sounds like you need a new group. Or to find a a group you can RP hard on the side.  Everyone’s got different pacing.
dndmemes,ff9kbdg,t1_ff9hqjc,1579714815.0,I’ve never had an empty feeling thinking my roleplay won’t be good as theirs. And that’s why shows like critical role can be hugely negative. You have an empty feeling? Just have fun. However you may. Critical role isn’t a fucking benchmark. They shouldn’t be. And that’s one of my issues with them in general.
dndmemes,ff9dk84,t3_esbigx,1579710668.0,It may just be me but I really hate the romanticized notion of Roleplaying games that things like critical role have created over the years. It’s made so many shit Players/DMs and people searching for a perfect ‘something’ instead of playing a game for fun.

AskReddit,fcyccff,t3_eje7fc,1578077965.0,"Old girlfriend of mine came over and hung out for a while when I was college but still at home. I had some clothes in a pile on a chair that looked like laundry. She pulls out a bra from the pile and yells at me “Who the fucks is this cuz I know it ain’t your mom or sisters that accidentally ended up here and it certainly isn’t mine!” I stared at her and muttered “um ah” a couple times and stammered as I had no clue. It finally dawns on me and I bust out laughing which pisses her off until I explain. It was a women’s in the drama class I was in. She didn’t have a suitcase for a scene we were in together so we used mine. I had dumped out the clothes when I got home and she had forgotten to take it back when she took the rest of her stuff. 

She was a good sport about it and was vaguely aware of the event so it wasn’t an issue."

To clarify I’ve seen a bunch of mild suggestions and pages where you can search entertainment or games, Alexa make a list sorta stuff. What I would love is just a long list of like “entertainment” followed by all known commands in that category for my parents to follow and remember

todayilearned,fcn4lfc,t1_fcmepzm,1577803109.0,I'm not sure I'm for or against suicide. I think it may be on a case by case basis for me? I'm really not sure. That said I do 100% agree that before helping someone end their life there should be some things you go through. Like making sure its not a passing temporary feeling because they're currently depressed and they've tried no alternatives first.

todayilearned,fc7o78h,t1_fc7lmg2,1577514111.0,"The process of creating a shrunken head begins with removing the skull from the neck. An incision is made on the back of the ear and all the skin and flesh is removed from the cranium. Red seeds are placed underneath the nostrils and the lips are sewn shut. The mouth is held together with three palm pins. Fat from the flesh of the head is removed. Then a wooden ball is placed under the flesh in order to keep the form. The flesh is then boiled in water that has been saturated with a number of herbs containing tannins. The head is then dried with hot rocks and sand, while molding it to retain its human features. The skin is then rubbed down with charcoal ash. Decorative beads may be added to the head.[3]

In the head shrinking tradition, it is believed that coating the skin in ash keeps the muisak, or avenging soul, from seeping out.

Shrunken heads are known for their mandibular prognathism, facial distortion and shrinkage of the lateral sides of the forehead; these are artifacts of the shrinking process.

Among the Shuar and Achuar, the reduction of the heads was followed by a series of feasts centered on important rituals."
