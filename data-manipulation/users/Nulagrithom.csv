As an IT professional who has worked with offices all over the US, you are sorely mistaken. 

Our last mile infrastructure is absolute fucking dogshit, and is a disgrace to our developed and modern nation.

The antitrust violations of ISPs and their local monopolies are the antithesis of free market, and any self-respecting capitalist should be *fucking pissed*.

Frankly, restoring the free market at this point would be incredibly difficult if not impossible. It's time to view the Internet as a utility, not a goddam luxury."
AskAnAmerican,fdnob1e,t1_fdn9np0,1578589869.0,"Except QoS doesn't really work like that. At all.

You don't just up the latency of video. That doesn't decrease its bandwidth requirements, doesn't improve overall performance, and as far as I'm aware it isn't really commonly possible to selectively buffer these specific packets for longer than others (not that you'd want to anyway).

What happens in reality is that video overwhelms the ISP's equipment and causes latency across the board, regardless of the ""type"" of data. 

I put ""type"" in quotes because in general your ISP doesn't really know for sure what the data is for. In some instances it might be obvious, such as a plain-text TCP connection on port 25 being SMTP for sending email (probably), but in many if not most instances your data is encrypted it could be damn near anything.

In short, it's not like these packets have a little flag that say ""Hey I'm playing an FPS game and I need to go really fast!"" But even if they did, you still couldn't just backburner all the video stuff and make everything work. The buffers would overflow eventually either way.

And if you buffer TCP packets for too long, you run in to timeout issues as well. You say ""who cares"" if email takes a minute, but it doesn't work like that. Your computer expects a timely response from the server on the other end. If it doesn't get it, then it believes something is wrong *and tries again*, which means more packets and more bandwidth. This is largely built in to the TCP spec. The Internet simply *wasn't built* for the kind of throttling shenanigans you describe.

In actuality, what the ISPs did before NN and have continued to do is throttle connections that *look* like video, but in many cases they've also throttle individual services like Netflix *specifically*. This degrades your video quality or sometimes even renders the service inoperable entirely. They do this because their equipment can't provide the Mbps they promised you, and lowering the video bandwidth makes it look like it's Netflix's problem (interestingly, when Netflix put a message on their loading banner saying something like ""the Verizon network in your area is experiencing issues"" they got sued).

Instead of upgrading their equipment to provide what you already paid for, ISPs just throttle video and tell Netflix to pay to ensure *you* get what *you already paid for*. And it's not like they want Internet video to take over anyway. They want to keep selling TV. And they have local monopolies across the US, so it's not like you can just switch ISPs. And even if you could, most the time it still ends up running through their equipment anyway.

It's the antithesis of a free market. This is antitrust and monopoly."
AskAnAmerican,fdnltbr,t1_fdn15u1,1578588481.0,"Verizon already tried (and succeeded) to do this to Netflix. They wanted Netflix to pay them to ensure *Verizon's* customers got the bandwidth *they were already paying for*.

There's been plenty of instances of where people found Netflix to be throttled by Verizon. Not just on mobile, but FiOS and other services as well.

Some cases have been so bad that simply VPNing the connection out to a nearby server fixed Netflix usage for end users.

All the people in this thread that think the ISPs did nothing haven't been paying attention. They were pulling this shit *before* NN, and they're continuing to do so."
AskAnAmerican,fdnl53v,t1_fdnhy60,1578588085.0,This. We were already getting fucked in the ass by big telecom. The last mile internet infrastructure in this country is largely broken.
AskAnAmerican,fdnkwzz,t1_fdn2c1d,1578587952.0,"Bullshit. You're talking out your ass.

Netflix already pays shitloads for their bandwidth. They pay CDNs like Level 3 and Akamai to push their traffic across the nation. They even put caching boxes in more local server racks to reduce traffic across the greater Internet.

Where they run in to trouble is in the ""last mile"".

The problem is ISPs don't give a *fuck* about their promised data rates. They'll sell you and thousands of others a 20 Mbps connection, then when it shits the bed they'll tell you ""lol well it's *up to* 20 Mbps"". And they have tidy little local monopolies all over the US to ensure they never have to upgrade their dogshit equipment because it's not like you're going anywhere anyway.

To begin with, this is the fucking antithesis of a free market, and should make any self-respecting free market capitalist pissed. Through government interference, lobbying, and subsidy, big telecom has crushed the free market.

Enter Netflix. Video eats a lot of bandwidth. If everyone comes home and starts watching Netflix instead of TV, the *local* ISP equipment completely shits the bed. Switches get overwhelmed, and it becomes pretty obvious that they really can't provide 20 Mbps for everyone. Not even fucking close.

So they blame Netflix. Because most consumers don't know any better. Then they try to get Netflix to pay them too.

So you're paying for 20 Mbps of Internet, and Netflix is paying to make sure *you* get what *you already paid for*, and the telecoms can get away with it because you can't switch providers anyway."
