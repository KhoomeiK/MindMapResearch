Holy waffels that is beyond cruel to say, especially since your kid passing away so suddenly is beyond horrible. I cant even imagine the pain you must have felt.
Yes it is very sad to lose a pet, they feel like family but you don't say that to someone who lost a child/friend/family member. I am truly a bit shocked."
