technology,ff90axx,t3_esbmvy,1579701565.0,"> How can a video contain code, malicious or otherwise?

It almost always boils down to the fact that computers don't know how long a memory region is. If you tell a computer you need 100 bytes of memory, you will get a number as answer that points to a point in the memory that the system allocated to you. It's your responsibility to remember that this region is 100 bytes long. If you try to write beyond the 100 bytes length it often works to a certain extent but you will eventually end up in memory that belongs to someone else or is not allocated at all, which results in those access violation error messages.

But you might be lucky and the memory region before yours or after yours might belong to your application too, which means you can write into those regions even though you should not. If you are extremely lucky, these regions contain data that is supposed to be executable code, which allows you to dynamically rewrite the code in memory, potentially changing it to something malicious.

How this is abused:

A text file is a simple thing, if you have a 200 byte file, it contains 200 bytes of text. A video file is much more complex. It has video, audio, metadata and subtitle, sometimes multiple of each one. This means we need to tell an application, where in the file those pieces are located and how long they are. You could now craft a file that has those offsets and/or numbers set in a way so that they are outside of the video file. If an application is not careful it will now access memory it should not and do whatever it interprets there.

A very similar thing was used to steal cryptographic keys from webservers that used OpenSSL (almost everything Linux based does). The TLS protocol (thing that makes HTTPS secure) has a command the client can send to the server that does nothing else than replying back with whatever data the client sent, sort of like the ping command on your computer. This is used to keep long running connections alive. It's called the heartbeat extension.

An oversight in the code of OpenSSL allowed a malicious packet to be sent.
The packet specified a length and data of that given length. Because it was valid at that point it was placed in memory and passed on to the function that reads the content and takes actions according to it. This function now looked at the contents of the packet and saw this ping command with a length that was way larger than the size of the entire packet.
Because someone forgot to validate this length, OpenSSL would read far beyond this data and return whatever came after it too to the client. By repeatedly executing this ping command you would get random chunks of memory, including the region that possibly contains the secret RSA key for the server certificate or leftover usernames and passwords from the requests of other users. This got the name [heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com/).

These types of attacks are generally known as a buffer overflow: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow (This also shows a simple example)

> And how can that code get access to data in a phone when iOS apps are sandboxed (assuming Jeff's phone was an iPhone)?

Like PhotoRec it doesn't depends on the file system still being intact. It merely reads individual sectors and checks if they belong to a jpeg, then reads more sectors until it has the entire file."
programming,ff7sl9y,t1_ff7qapj,1579657350.0,"There's two ways to restore files:

You can try to restore it from the file index of whatever file system is on it. Deleting a file doesn't erases the entry entirely, it just marks the entry as deleted and the sectors it occupied as free. No data is actually overwritten. Depending on the file system this is an attribute that is set or by changing the file name to something invalid. This is done in FAT for example by using a question mark as the first letter because a FAT driver ignores invalid entries.
This approach is very fast, provides good results and is often able to restore fragmented files. The file system has to be mostly intact for this to work though.

The second way is to essentially brute force it but it works with severely damaged or even missing file systems and partition tables.
You read the disk in blocks of whatever the sector size is (usually 512 but can be a multiple of it) and check if that block looks like an image using so called magic numbers (most formats start with a certain sequence of bytes, for example for JPEG it's FF-D8-FF).
You then use the information in the header to figure out how large the image is and read that many bytes from the disk. This fails if the file was fragmented. It's not a huge problem for SD cards from dedicated digital cameras because you usually delete all files on them after you copied everything away, which means there's almost no need for fragmentation. The story is different for MicroSD cards from a phone where files are much more frequently changed.

Since data on the card is allocated in blocks of whatever the sector size is or multiples of it, you can under some circumstances recover a fragmented file if it has a well defined structure without the information from the file system itself.
You can essentially read a sector and check if the image would stay valid if you appended it. If not, you discard the sector and try the next one. This will be a very long process unless the entire disk fits into memory. You can optimize it by reading the image headers on the first swoop and then try to append sectors to each one of them every time you read the disk."
