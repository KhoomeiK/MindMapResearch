For the same stuff but a few years earlier:  https://thinkprogress.org/states-spend-millions-to-drug-test-the-poor-turn-up-few-positive-results-81f826a4afb7/

>these 13 states tested 2,826 people out of about 250,000 applicants and recipients in 2016. Of those tested, just 369 came back positive. In four states, drug testing uncovered exactly zero positive tests for the whole year. The positive drug test rate out of all applicants, in states where people tested positive, ranged from 0.07 percent in Arkansas to 2.14 percent in Utah; none of them came anywhere close to the national drug use rate of 9.4 percent for the general population...states collectively spent more than $1.3 million on drug testing for TANF in 2016. Add that to the nearly $2 million states spent in the prior two years

Forbes (which surprised me) has an article to similar effect. https://www.forbes.com/sites/judystone/2015/02/17/the-sham-of-drug-testing-walker-scott-and-political-pandering/
They cite the federal substance abuse and mental health services administration for a figure of 2% drug use amongst welfare population vs 9.4% in the general population. 

Yet another. https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/374700-punishing-the-poor-isnt-just-bad-policy-its-wasting-taxpayer-money
> Florida taxpayers, for example, spent $118,140 to reimburse people who tested negative for the cost of testing, which was $45,780 more than the state saved by denying benefits to the 2.6 percent of applicants who tested positive.
