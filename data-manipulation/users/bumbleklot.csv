Very sad. Still I eat beef when it’s free , so I’m no better than the cattle farmers . But crazy stuff. No telling how smart cows are. Maybe gods eyes"

But yeah baseball caps or no cover my whole life. Usually a tshirt with tactical gear. Maybe a cowboy hat. Traffic/highway police still wear uniform tho.

todayilearned,fdszi1p,t1_fdsrs4c,1578709967.0,"Tallow is worse, only because the “popcorn” it drops toxifies the ground , making the soil chemistry uniquely unsuitable for the native plants (of the southeastern US) and for crops. It is beautiful, and government issued literature from as recently as the 70s lists it as a good ornamental shade tree. Most of these (southeast Asian, mostly) “tropical” trees have very short life spans (same as most warm weather trees) , reproduce very quickly or rhizomously, have very pretty foliage, and have mechanisms of changing the soil chemistry negatively. Anyway, where I’m from tallow thicket blankets vast expanses of abandoned farmland (that was once transitional prarie /pineywoods). The prettiness wears off. No one planted it there. Where I live now, lots of chinaberry , privet , nandina, pear, tallow present, mimosa present due to poor management prior to my moving to the land. Was once shortleaf pine/mixed hardwood/canebrake/bottomland . Will eventually look like an overgrown superWalmart garden center thx to encroaching concrete. None of this stuff was intentionally planted here either. It was planted by neighbors , businesses, brought by seed in bird, animal droppings"

Plus who knows what heavy metals are in that random outdoor soil that’s going to leech up into the flowers . Woody Asian plants are a much bigger problem than herbs, as of yet"
todayilearned,fdsd0na,t1_fdsbbi5,1578699830.0,Same situation with mass random tree planting. All kinds of horrible invasive species’ being introduced to new areas for an apparently good cause .  People need to talk to local ecologists before they just randomly start planting trees.

I’m from a massive state that’s instead run by the rural parts, and here there hasn’t been any sane legislation in years. Public education and infrastructure have gone from the best in the country to the worst after 30 years of GOP control here (sponsored by rural vote + handsome gerrymandering). Arlen doesn’t exist anywhere because the middle class doesn’t exist anymore.  My state’s better known politicians are global embarrassments at best but much more likely actual traitors.

He is conservative in some ways, but in terms of modern American politics he’s pretty liberal. The church is filled with gun nuts and trump fanatics. Not sure how he deals with it. He actually reads the literature the church provides him, and it doesn’t seem to have brainwashed him. Although I don’t think this is a ‘prosperity gospel’ focused evangelical church. Idk the dude immersed himself in rednecks, I really don’t get it, hope he has an angle (sees himself as a mole on behalf of the better elements of Christian values). Idk.

After the protections came into existence, it became much easier for wealthy businessmen and political leaders to get their drafted kids into “protected” jobs. This killed the integrity of the draft, and a major reason for the protests that eventually ended it. Now, the rich and powerful don’t have to worry about their kids getting drafted (I also know rich kids being chastised by fam for joining military for patriotic/honor related reasons). Thus, we have endless worldwide conflict with no complaints from the ruling class, bc they don’t have to worry about little W being sucked-up by selective service"

But yeah if I’m ever president I will commit to not being a war criminal. & I try to support like minded candidates.

It’s mostly admixture of prosperity gospel, threats from the Old Testament, adherance to Romans, and “it doesn’t really matter if you understand as long as you’ve been baptized and verbally acknowledge you’re a *Christian*.” I honestly think Christ would agree, in the Bible Belt, “Christianity *IS* a cult”, and their “religion is evil.”"
