Have you ever filed a flight plan?

None of this is necessary for typical drone flying outside controlled airspace. In fact, the current regulations are working just fine, keeping people below 500' (where only helicopters or ag planes generally fly).

However, all the 9/11 hijackers were taught how to do all these things as part of their preparation for actual terrorism. And a savvy terrorist preparing for a major incident would use everything at their disposal to ""seem legitimate"".
