MadeMeSmile,fflth3i,t1_ffbnlgy,1580043904.0,"I mean, here's the lens I choose to see it all through: 
Everyone is trying their best, including the boomers.
The Boomer generation wasn't raised in a world where you can fact check anyone you meet with technology, or communicate with anyone else with similar technology at any time. 
They were lied to by companies trying to wring every penny from them and turn them into perfect little consuming slaves. 
For the most part, they did what they thought would work, which was the path created for them by corporate greed. 
Obviously not all of them are saints, but can you honestly say you'd have done better if you were raised under the same circumstances? 
If I were to trade places with them, I'd have probably made the same mistakes; including being proud of my creation for fixing the problems my generation caused- not out of entitled laziness, but because I would honestly be proud of someone capable of identifying a problem through the haze of propaganda that made it seemingly impossible to come out on top.
If you didn't have that knowledge at your fingertips, and it required you to detour an already busy schedule to go to a library and hope to find what you're looking for, I can completely understand why so many said ""lol I'm not a scientist, I'll leave that to them""
I'm not trying to say they didn't fuck things up- only that the world was ignorant before we could talk to eachother like we do today."

I worry for them.  I've made friends with some of them.
I worry about China too, as their 250 year plan seems to be going off without a hitch.
As far as the nukes go, mutually assured destruction isn't something that I would say is obviously not a problem.  When I served, if I needed to do my actual job the world was going to end.  When I first arrived there, I was briefed my mission and the implications of ever having to carry that mission out, and people would discuss off the record their plans for informing their family to GTFO in the event of modern nuclear war.  EMPs are not a joke, just one would destroy life as we know it in America. Otherwise, I made sure radios didn't break.

science,femkejw,t1_femg7ga,1579260006.0,"I'd heard on a video somewhere a way to explain entanglement that really helped me to understand it better, I'm not a physicist but here's my understanding: If you were playing billiards, and the cue ball collided with another ball, that is the ""event"".
They both behave in inverse to each other, because every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
If you were to try to observe either the struck pool ball or the striking pool cue by picking it up, you would impart your own forces on it, invalidating any attempt to measure it. 
They don't become their nature when you try to observe, they ARE their nature, your observation is going to cause chaos in the system they are in. 
If you could observe the pool cue or ball somehow, without ""picking it up"" and manage to decipher some properties from it, you could more confidently describe the entangled state of other objects within the same system. 
It isn't as if the entangled particles know how to behave when an observer decides to watch, it's that any act of ""watching"" displaces the system they're in."
funny,fek7irl,t1_fejz4rf,1579194232.0,"If you read the article, you'd see the guy was caught on camera doing it, the dart was recovered, and they've identified why it's happening. There was a bust of 200K syringes with this muscle relaxant in it and these guys were killing dogs to sell for streetmeat vendors. 
The tainted meat can hurt people who consume it as well.
Just because this guy retaliated in the moment doesn't mean a formal investigation doesn't occur, it just means that the consequences of his retaliation apply; we don't get to learn more about the individual caught on camera darting dogs or his affiliations.
Not saying I don't disagree, he definitely needs to see someone about what happened, but I don't think it's unreasonable to react the way he did- crime of passion. I'd be enraged beyond belief if this happened to my dogs, and I'd probably react the same way if I caught the guy who did it myself.

AskReddit,fejww5b,t1_fejk23y,1579187709.0,"A surface blast nuclear detonation will have a weaker EMP that attenuates to power lines and generally doesn't do a lot in comparison to a HEMP, or high altitude emp. 

A HEMP creates an enormous pulse that can cover an enormous range.  I'm not an engineer, just a radio tech that used to work on EMP hardened facilities.  Those engineers could explain why the atmosphere up high makes the EMP so much more devastating, but I can't recall. It's crazy though. 

What I do know, is it doesn't just reset electronics, it melts them.  Anything that is small and can conduct electricity gets so overloaded with energy it turns red hot and disappears. Bigger things do better, but powerlines are still sensitive. 

A HEMP detonation over the center of CONUS would wipe out all unhardened electronics in the US."

LSD,fejoemu,t3_epieba,1579181579.0,"I didn't follow any of the recommended advice for numerous trips, and I've had mixed results. While hellish, bad trips help you heal. They teach you about yourself in ways you can't explain, if you're strong enough to sit there feeling the worst depressive episode you've ever felt. 

That's a big ""if""

Every bad trip I've learned from has at one point or another made me feel like killing myself. 
I don't go into any kind of trip with hopes or expectations anymore; I just get a feeling when I'm stuck in a rut that it's time to do it again, whether I feel good or bad during the trip is inconsequential, it clears my mind for months afterwards, and before I'd ever tried psychedelics I was riddled with suicidal ideation and thoughts. 

Last time I wanted to sit down and enjoy a fire outdoors with my dog and mom on 200ug, a guy my dad's friend hired to help with fixing cars came over to our house and just ruined the trip. 
Started talking about how lucky we were to have dogs or someone could steal our shit, and said it'd be a shame if something happened to the dogs. Like it was a movie. This guy was whacked the fuck out, by appearances you could tell he was a meth / opiate addict. 

I love my dogs when Im sober.   But I turned into the monkey in me and just... Watched him. My mom told him to leave, and I spent the next few hours just staring at him from across the property (they did the mechanic work in a horse barn on the property, maybe 300' away. 
I couldn't ignore him, I couldn't stop thinking about it. 
I don't think I have to describe the thoughts I was having at the time, they were primitive. 
Normally I'd have said something or laughed it off and walked away, but this...

So I guess Its up to you.

And from watching / reading what this drone company says it does better vs manual plantings, is the height of the drop allows the seed pod to force it's way into the soil to the depth it needs to be in order for the seeds thrive.  (Won't be perfect, but it's way faster) 
This can be done in any terrain environment, covering a large area in a fraction of the time it would take manual laborers to accomplish it.  Imagine a carpet bomb of seeds, it doesn't take a lot to spread a fuckton of seed over a large area from a good height."
Futurology,fde4s5m,t1_fde47o7,1578331171.0,"It would be the cost of the seed pellet with drone operation costs compared to the cost of a sapling & manual labor. They're working the seed pellet manufacturing process to be as cheap as possible. 

And how long does it take to manually plant a tree, let alone care for it? 20 minutes? 30?
At half an hour per tree that's half a billion man hours, so at minimum wage that would cost around 3.6B for labor alone. 

So if you use that as your ceiling, plus whatever the sapling cost would be, maybe it starts to make sense to be inefficient with drones if we can get a pellet price down to say, $0.0001-$0.001 ea, you get a price of 50-500million for the seeds, and then whatever you can get drone labor for the given amount of hours needed added on. That's assuming that they can produce pellets that cheap though.
