Not a huge deal leaving the carb onlike that so long as it doesn't sit for too long, I'd say over a month.  Whenever it gets kinda sorta warm, I'd suggest taking it out for a short ride, just to keep the jet clear.  When you bring it in, set the switch to off and let the engine run till it starves and shuts off on its own.  It can take a couple minutes at idle, just park it in neutral and wait."
motorcycles,ffpmha9,t1_ffpmc4f,1580098729.0,"Assuming it's still carbourated, it should be a little 3-position dial on the left-side of the engine.  Left for reserve, down for off, and right for on (non-reserve)

I keep a fuel log using the AUTOsist app, and it lets me get an accurate picture of my fuel economy.  I usually get 50-60mpg, but on a longer trip loaded with luggage and going 80mph on I-10, woah boy did it drop."

motorcycles,ffpm41y,t1_ffpgl32,1580098451.0,"Earplugs help the riding experience, but more importantly they will SAVE YOUR HEARING. Wind noise on longer rides will absolutely damage your hearing over the long term.

Personally, I use Honeywell Lazer-Lites. You can get a box of 200 on Amazon, and it comes out to like 10 cents a pair.  Don't reuse them for more than a short stop.  Does a great job muffling louder noises while still letting you hear the road and your helmet comm speakers.  For me they're quite comfortable once you get them to seal, but that can take a couple tries."
motorcycles,ffplrzy,t1_ffpdqf5,1580098213.0,"Comfortable enough for maybe two hours on the highway.  I added an AirHawk 2 Cruiser cushion to mine. Takes a bit of trial and error to dial in the air pressure so as not to add pressure to your upper thighs, but once you do it makes a world of difference. Forward controls mean you generally put more pressure on your tailbone than a more upright position would, and that's what the AirHawk takes care of.

I did a 460 mile ride to visit my folks for Thanksgiving on my Shadow 750. Factor that you'll be taking more frequent breaks into your scheduling.  My fuel economy dropped like a stone when I had loaded saddlebags and a huge sissy bar bag, as low as 40mpg at highway speeds, and I hit the reserve at around 110 miles (that was a fun new experience!)

TLDR: You totally can take longer trips on a smaller cruiser, but do test rides first.  Find a nice loop near your home area and do some distance riding to see how you hold up."
