Like we have National Geographic..... They may just be here to ensure that we do not destroy earth. 


Another thing that I think, is that we are an experiment. All mammals were placed in this reptile planet. Reptiles can take care of themselves from birth. Mammals can not, they require milk from their mothers and teaching. So essentially reptiles are pre programmed, and mammals are programmable. 

No fucking way in hell did a baby mammal anything raise itself to adulthood. Whether we were genetically engineered or brought here from somewhere else is the question.

Maybe aliens if they exist are the universes maintenance, they go around to habitable worlds and fill them with animals and perhaps other intelligent life. Then monitor these places, perhaps this is the way the universe manifest itself. It wants to be..."
