mentalillness,fe4kzqf,t3_enn77a,1578860436.0,"I haven't been in these forums long, but they have really helped me nevertheless: commiserating with people who understand, reading what helps others gives me more options to consider,  even being a little challenged about my posts opens my mind, expands me beyond  set ideas, myopic beliefs. 

Ive white knuckled it through a few bad depressions recently by visiting these forums"
bipolar,fdj10pi,t3_elkvip,1578455700.0,"Yes, bipolar did poison a lot of my friendships.  I am fortunate that i was able to rebuild relationships with my sister and a friend after i got stable.  

Before i admitted i had problem, and took medication/therapy seriously, i tested relationships.  When manic, i was all charm, easy to befriend, positive, creative,  told was fun & funny.  Then it would tip into warp drive, and became sarcastic, caustic, hypersexual.  The fun daring person became the risk taker with a death wish.  Then, of course, the depression hit- to many, it was like i was a totally different, unappealing, person:  listless, introverted, fatalistic.  

I am grateful for the friends who stuck w me, even briefly.  I can see now how exhausting and challenging illness can be. I reached out to a few people who i thought i would not be reopening old wounds if contacted, offered apology and reconnection if they desired.  I accepted the boundaries they set for reconnecting, but if seemed too punitive i wished them well and left it alone.     Once my sister & friend saw i was taking my health seriously, was committed to sobriety (ie sanity), and i became less unpredictable, they felt safer getting close, opening lives up to me.   Its a day to day intentional act for me. 

When i could be more consistent (not disappearing, not becoming manically ""entertaining"", presenting in more  stable way), it helped.  I still get sick, but try to be honest, know my triggers.   I am still learning"
bipolar,fdiyf5u,t3_elbjna,1578453903.0,"I'm glad you posted this. I'm struggling with similar issues. Now that I'm healthier in other areas, I'm having to learn how to establish relationships. Before I was medicated,  bipolar charm gained me a lot of friends. But the detrimental side of bipolar ended a lot of these connections. 

You must not be totally bereft of skill however. Having a successful relationship, and still having family members around seems to me a real achievement. I'm also lucky to have some supportive family members. I think this shows it can be done, that there are already some of the skills there. There's a foundation to build upon.

Medications were a bittersweet blessing for me - more stable, able to get healthy, but not all issues ameliorated.  I also had that chilled 3-am reckoning that THE PROBLEM IS ME.  

I will start working w my therapist next week on this issue.  Im excited to begin, but feel despair at lack of attachments right now.  
Am interested to also glean help from responses to your post.  Hope you will update.  Best to you"
bipolar,fdiwp4m,t3_eljz1a,1578452754.0,"You are so right on.  Her writing really impacted me.   A woman writing so personally about addiction and mental illness, not in doleful shame but with humor, seemed bold and amazing.   I was still believing that mi, addictions were degrading burdens, that must be kept secret, never spoken of aloud.  Thankful for her and others who ""outed"" themselves in a riskier time."
bipolar,fdiv4yw,t1_fdhkz27,1578451732.0,"Yes! - celebrating your productive anger & righteous fight!  Inspired by you, ""F*ck you, Bipolar"" helped me finish my steps today, too. I may have found my mantra....."
bipolar,fde574g,t3_ekpqbn,1578331435.0, Im really glad you posted update.
mentalillness,fcu7lki,t1_fcu0dfe,1577974453.0,"No, you're right. Thanks for pointing that out. Lots of people go about their day 2 day lives and you would never know if they were struggling inside or not. I apologize for being glib, perpetuating something that's a real problem. Appreciate your comment"
mentalillness,fctk2h7,t1_fctjo7k,1577946082.0,I meant that to be sardonic. Does feel like commodification
mentalillness,fctjo7k,t3_eir5lx,1577945643.0,"I'm all for fighting stigma, but this looks like it's meant to be ironic. I could be wrong. What I do know, is that's not the typical face of depression. But i guess it wouldn't sell if it looked like both the guy and the shirt hadn't been washed in 2 weeks.  Plus you couldn't see the logo if he was laying in the fetal position."
bipolar,fcs6lis,t3_eilu3r,1577912156.0,I appreciate your response- thank you for sharing
bipolar,fcs2g98,t3_eilu3r,1577910454.0,"That is a major achievement ! If you don't mind sharing, have you seen improvement by keeping to your med schedule, more so than before?  Eg, what improvement(s), has it been better managing mood, more hopeful, etc.  Id love to know.   Good on you!"

bipolar,fcqypy0,t1_fcqwnwn,1577894213.0,"I got some good stuff from your post - appreciate your insight.  Will be checking out ACT.   Like the neutralizing  language. DBT goes with ""effective/not-effective"" which was also helpful.  Take care"
bipolar,fcqxttw,t3_eibfp9,1577893834.0,"Lamictal is holding my head above water.  I have been able to make more effective choices, start paving a future because of Lamictal.  Its the only med, thus far, that has helped me without wretched side effects and sickening med hangovers.  I still get mania spikes, fall into chasms of despair, but can right my life faster and with less damage.  Its like being tethered so i can only fly or drop so far.    Lamictal, you are imperfect, not everyone can tolerate you, but you make me a better person."

Therapy could be the way through: route with most compassion, and learn heathy ways to manage.  I'm not adding much to conversation, but wanted to reach out, let you know you've been heard.  
Take care of yourself."

mentalillness,fclmhxq,t3_eh5xos,1577751264.0,"I appreciate your honesty posting this. Though it seems stakes low posting in anonymity,  admitting to these feelings is pretty bold.  

 I have ptsd. When it was more raw (ie up to 3 yrs after event)  i went from mild mannered calm to rabid berserker when i felt threatened.  Thank god i never assaulted anyone but it was close (shouting and shoving matches or exchanging punches w strangers, property damage) .  Anger for me was poison, it provided such a rush of power that was vital to me after the event that caused ptsd.  I believe like anything though one starts to need higher doses to feel the same purge of ones own bad feelings/energy. 

For me, what helped:
The right meds, balm of passage of time, dbt training (learned some self awareness and control), depleting by running or something physical, recognizing signs im ramping up, recognizing triggers, and learning ways to soothe myself.   Ex for me include knowing drinking turns me into a pugilist, avoiding too huggy coworker, not being passenger in vehicle, and allowing myself to just leave, whenever wherever, when i start to feel irritated and get sarcastic.

Wish you the best, and some solace.  If you're really in extremis, emergency room may be the place to be."
mentalillness,fclkea2,t3_egpoe5,1577749838.0,"Managed to go outside after 3 days isolation.  In my downtime (ie non work hours)  i kind of mentally drift.  I do poorly with unstructured time. Without external enforcement (don't work, don't get paid) i really struggle to stay conscious, on track w goals.  Bought toilet paper feeling like Hercules, victorious over impossible odds."
bipolar,fckzecd,t3_ehohni,1577736470.0,That sounds pretty significant; a book is an implied commitment.  Glad there is an injection of hope. Wishing for you that this provides a buoy to keep your head above the depths.   Take care
bipolar,fccomig,t3_eh11ei,1577600818.0,"My self care plans for this new year are to try to focus on inching forward.  To try to give self compassion, rather than driving with spur and whip.   To redirect thoughts so not punishing with the past or building manic fantasy futures that i feel like a failure for not achieving.  

I've learned any movement towards a better life is progress, even if today its just getting out of bed, or bathing ""just the necessary bits"" (respect to coworkers).  

All  cliches, but with bipolar its been like groping my way out of a burning house. No time to process or reflect, just trying to luck into an exit.  

This year, i want to do more than just what is necessary to survive.  If i can calm myself and stay in reality, i think i have a shot moving up Maslows Hierarchy.  Several steps if i apply myself! And if i can refrain from dismantling progress made when depression tells me there is no hope, and that nothing comes true.  Im trying to keep it light, but there's an unspoken, ""please, god!"" in there

Wishing best for everyone.."
