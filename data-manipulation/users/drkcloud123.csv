Only problem I see is that at the start he should have the bar as close to his shin as possible. 

And it seems the problem with the descent is really just general lack of awareness of form which is understandable since he is relatively new. He kept his knees locked on the way down. He just needs to hinge down with unlocked knees and let the weight down once it's past the knees on the way down. I would not bother using bar on thigh as a cue because what tends to happen is that people drag the bar along their thigh and they turn the eccentric into some kind of thigh massage that follows the thigh on a diagonal direction instead of bringing the bar straight down."

When you deload after a particularly good workout cycle your body tends to supercompensate. When you are training and loading your body (volume work over time) you are gonna be slightly weaker. 

The hope is to improve your training base line level as you train so that your general base line fitness becomes greater and when you DO deload, you will be even stronger than just 16 reps. Even if you wait until you are ""fully rested between session"" you might still not be in the same super compensated state as your 16 rep pull up and also your average baseline fitness won't improve nearly as fast..

Sumos you try to stay as upright and keep yours hips as close to the bar as possible. Furthermore, you need to use the bar as a counter weight to wedge your whole body against it. (Think rocking back and leveraging your body against the bar - almost like a tug of war but keeping your back straight and foot right by the bar). 

Move the weights further away from the bushing if you are running out of footing, you got 4 inches over me and my foot is already on the bushing.

That way your back is pre-set and all that you have to worry about is your hips and knees.
Main issue is you have a preset hip height that you keep yourself to when your lower back can't even get into position, you were actually hinging down mid-way, stopped because you reached your pre-set hip height and then rounded your entire back to reach the bar."

That's like me telling you that you should only post 400+ lbs on deadlift for better form checks when your working weight is 315lbs. That would be foolish of me.

Just a recap the 135lb mark is an arbitrary number you set (you even initially suggested 225lbs!)

Beyond this when you squat and do any exercise that requires foot stability I suggest you artificially create a foot arch. Learn to hold it, learn to grasp things between your big toe and second toe and also work on getting other toe mobility. (Spread your toes out and wiggle them often)

When you are completely flat footed you will almost always have knee valgus when you squat, work on finding that foot width/knee flare sweet spot where it occurs less. Otherwise you will be suffering from knee pain frequently. On another note **do.not.neglect.calves** whether calve strength or flexibility. One of the causes of flat feet is tightness of the calves which cause weakening of support structures/ligaments that are responsible for flat feet.

formcheck,ffij8z7,t3_etpntq,1579975182.0,Yea your set up is bad. you literally left yourself with tons of slack  by rolling the bar around and then proceed to touch and go without once again taking all the slack off.
formcheck,ffh6gwk,t1_ffgtsby,1579924439.0,Best of luck man. You got this
formcheck,ffgomlt,t3_etgcpu,1579911154.0,"You should not change anything in your form. It looks solid. If you want to learn low bar for powerlifting by all means, there is almost a 80-90lb difference between my high bar and my low bar. 

There is gonna be some reworking that needs to be dealt with. Nothing crazy but the sensation of hitting depth is going to be different on both forms, and you want to learn to just hit parallel if you want max numbers for power lifting."
formcheck,ffbwud1,t3_esprmi,1579785375.0,Very normal to feel it in your quads. Deadlifts involves extension of the knee and hip joints. Quads are fully in charge of knee extension. It would be weird if you don't feel it in your quad.
formcheck,ffb26hd,t3_esfwda,1579749917.0,Your sets look solid. Others mentioned over arching but it just seems like your natural spine curvature to be honest and unless there is pain I would not worry about then
formcheck,ff7j9ic,t3_es2624,1579650857.0,I would recommend to post a form check. It's hard to see how much your knees hyperextend without seeing it. For all we know your ROM could be entirely normal and the problem lies elsewhere.
formcheck,ff7iz1y,t1_ff7gy8w,1579650657.0,"Well you have a deadlift platform so no one cares but you can always do something in between the two. Drop em once it's past the knees (so hinging back as well).

Once again this is only in the context that there is no deadlift platform. If you got a platform it wouldn't matter because that's what it's for."
formcheck,ff7g6xr,t3_es2t2l,1579648808.0,Reps look very solid. Lucky you were working on a deadlift platform and not a random commercial gym floor. You drop em fairly high.
formcheck,ff58skn,t3_ermdzf,1579583642.0,"You're slamming the weights at the bottom by the safeties. That causes you to loosen tension right before the concentric and also fuck up your form. Furthermore, this weight might just be too heavy for you, there's not a single rep of squat that has clean form."
formcheck,ff56twk,t3_ermz4j,1579581903.0,Your form is just fine. You're ready for heavier weight.
formcheck,ff2wpbi,t3_eracfy,1579526986.0,"Your grip is extremely narrow, it's a close grip bench press. A simple measuring method is one hand width away from the smooth area (given your hand size your pinkie finger or ring finger should be around the knurling probably not wider than that but certainly play around with it)"

If the newest owner had no idea it was stolen are they out for the money they paid for the stolen painting? (Like falsified records in regards to the painting)"
AskReddit,feoper9,t3_eq1xux,1579303471.0,"I'm Asian and part of my elementary school years were in the Dominican republic. Dominicans were hella racists and i remember so many adults and kids were harassing me and making fun of my ethnicity growing, they never started any physical confrontations but it's rare to go a single day without someone throwing ""Chino"" this and Chino that and make fun of the way I talked.  Ofc, not everyone is like that but it's very easy to remember all the bad memories over the positive ones.

The rest of my education was in the u.s. where I lived easy walking distance from projects so both middle school and high school. Most of the bullying we're done by blacks and Italians. 

The Asians and Hispanics kept to themselves or they would argue and fight amongst themselves. It was hard to say we were explicitly targeted because of of race but when kids don't know better ways of taunting each other beyond racial expletives it's also hard to say that we weren't. The worst ones were the black kids (just the guys), the Italian kids would only try to jump you if they think you've got cash and you looks vulnerable/alone 

But black kids would just start shit just cause they wanna fuck with you, it wasn't even about money most of the time.

Hell there was one instance where a black kid would ambush random passerbys with spray deodarant in their face.  He never did that to other black kids and I called him out being racist.  He had a reaction and I'm assuming somehow it gave him a reaction of some kind cause he immediately went to targeted some Spanish kid thinking it's fine cause he wasn't Asian, he gave me a small glance with a smug ass look afterwards as if he proved me wrong."
formcheck,feoe4ev,t3_eq7ay8,1579298877.0,It looks fine but you were not under any sort of weight that was challenging for you.  Can you grip with a full grip or are you using two fingers because of mobility issues?
AskReddit,feo50va,t1_feo18ae,1579295202.0,"That kind of mentality is a pretty first world problem to have.

formcheck,fen22c3,t1_fen0fd3,1579275236.0,You gotta do what you gotta do. If you can't get set properly after your eccentric either you speed up your eccentric where your back doesn't round( or atleast you can re-set easily) or do what you just mentioned earlier to set up once again. Practical or not it's necessary to avoid excess shear force.
formcheck,fen0bqs,t3_eq16xx,1579274105.0,That is why you should reset every rep.

formcheck,fel83ai,t3_epn9ey,1579216096.0,Forms fine but it's too light to really accurately judge
formcheck,fekletn,t1_fekj3mh,1579202481.0,"Part of it should be core bracing. Perhaps it's because we don't see your face and there's not much apparent visual cues of you bracing your core. Are you tightening up your entire abdominal area and stabilizing your spine? If you do your back wouldnt over arch and your belly shouldnt be sticking out forwards.

What this means is that you are taking the chest up cue and ignoring the tightening of your core primarily your abs.

In between your reps just tighten your core and breathe!"
formcheck,fek7v93,t3_epjmhi,1579194440.0,"So you made the mistake of just pushing your knees out with minimal hip involvement. The end range of motion was also too low for you hence the low back rounding.

Given you are doing strict form high bar but you have to mess around with knee flare and hip involvement. 

That and also this weight is too heavy for you to properly judge."
formcheck,fek6ben,t3_epknpp,1579193516.0,"Pull your shoulder blades back. Your arm also is a tad extremely narrow, If you are mainly just targeting triceps that's fine I suppose.

A perfect push up almost looks like you are hitching your body forward a bit on the way down. The top position your arms should be a tad more forward as well (this could be because of narrow arm tuck, a slightly more flared out arm should fix it)"
