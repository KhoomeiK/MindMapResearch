What happens instead is that I see the amount due for the next month's payment is reduced by the amount of my overpayment and nothing happens to the interest schedule.

Checks and payments that are made explicitly as ""principal only"" get treated this same way and TFS responds to inquiries about it with a form letter/e-mail that says what their policy is. The one they're not following.

I have never made a successful principal-only payment despite many attempts and following their instructions on how to accomplish this."

Latimer did invent a novel way to produce carbon filament for light bulbs. Many people mistakenly claim that all of Edison's bulbs used bamboo as a filament base material but there's evidence that he tried quite a few materials.

I bought a batch of seven ADATA SSD's about six months ago and used them in a raid10 w a parity drive.

All of them are dead. One by one, they have gone from being a drive to being a device that makes the disk manager slog off. One of them even overcurrented the sata port it was on and turned into a smoking mess. The controllers are garbage. The media itself doesn't seem to survive sustained write cycles very well, either.
