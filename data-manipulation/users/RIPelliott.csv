At first I got depressed looking at all the responses on here saying “lol I’d never live with my parents ever”, but then I remember just how often on Reddit I see threads where everyone is all “my parents died and holy fucking shit I would do anything to have another moment with them”. Remember that you and I won’t ever have that regret because we took advantage while they were here. That helps me a lot. It doesn’t seem as clear now cause they’re still around but when they aren’t, it’ll be even more worth it."

But when it’s so immediate and in your face, for you to not see it, it’s just shocking. If I smoke and tell others smoking is bad I’m a hypocrite. But to me, someone saying smoking is bad and then that weekend going on a yacht and having a cigarette is hypocritical, but it’s miles and miles different from someone saying smoking is bad *while having a cigarette in their mouth*. That’s an unbelievable and concerning amount of hypocrisy. There is no way that mindset doesn’t seep into other areas of their life, probably all of them.

Something, personally, that confirms this to me is the following: in a theoretical situation where an average girl I’m friends with has slept around a ton, but it’s Tom cruise, brad Pitt, all the hemsworths etc then yes I would be legitimately impressed, just like I would for a man, because she clearly had to put the work in.

AskMen,ferm3fu,t3_eqgcia,1579355688.0,"Dude you literally know exactly what to do, you said it all. Get a job you enjoy or at least begin looking for one. Chill with your male friends at work and get that bro time going, even if it starts with drinks after work or something. Try a day or two a week at the gym. Maybe it’s just me but having a six pack and even halfway decent biceps that look good in a t shirt, it’s literally impossible to not drip confidence, especially when women begin noticing and feeling you up (which they will). As far as how to act around women that really depends on what you look like and what you’re comfortable with. Since I have dark features I play up the mysterious and somewhat dangerous role and I’m unbelievably successful, but a blond haired blue eyed guy probably couldn’t do the same. One day you’ll be with the bros out and about somewhere and some woman will really like your crew and you in particular and before you know it you’ll have your ideal situation. It’s a lot of work of course, but dude I gotta tell you, this entire summer I spent at my friends lake house with seven of my bros, all of us with our girlfriends/wives, and it was the greatest thing of my entire life. Having both the romantic and friendship part of your life so nicely intertwined is an incredible feeling."
AskMen,ferlaej,t1_ferhgjj,1579355378.0,This reeks of lack of real life experience lmao. Go out and actually do it a few times and report back - you’ll change your tune real quick

AskMen,feolft0,t3_eq2bom,1579301820.0,"Your expectations are objectively ridiculously when it comes to dating. I broke up with my girl in September, so about four months. If you were to ask me how it’s been since then, I’d instinctively say terrible and depressing, which it has. And yet, I’ve had sex with like six or seven new women and been on dates with four women in that time period (funny enough, only one of the women I had sex with I took out on a date). But the depression about not getting a girl and all that is real, I mean I went on medication this month for it. I guess you get used to it tbh."

Lmao ok"
AskMen,feok20n,t3_eq2bom,1579301267.0,"So this is one that’s subtle but I think is def a big one. I post Snapchat stories every month or few weeks or so. As many know, you can kinda see a preview of the snap story without viewing it. 95% of the time my stories are places I’m traveling cause I travel for work. Usually those get 50 or so views. When I post a selfie, which is legit once every six months, I get about 100 views, all the additional ones are women, and a couple ones I hooked up with a few years ago will often hit me up"
