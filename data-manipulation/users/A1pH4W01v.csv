It just means, you can infinitely resupply for the first 45 seconds as long as youre in the zone, and you can still use the resupply crate. Probably not touching the fact you can still half-resupply for mags."

If you had a person whos venting out to you, listen to them. Dont interrupt them since it only makes them feel ignored and unimportant. It doesnt matter if you dont know how to respond, just listen to them and try to get every second of their thoughts out so they can be in a calmer, more sane and focused state of mind. And from there, you can probably give out your thoughts or in a best moment, try to change the subject and engage in a good conversation with them over some cookies or something."
