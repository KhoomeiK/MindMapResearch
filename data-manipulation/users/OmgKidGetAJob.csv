However you're talking to the wrong guy about ""Marx Himself"". While I have an understanding of Marx's Kapital, and I have read Lenin's ""The State and Revolution"" as well as Mao's ""On Liberalism"", I do not agree with Communism as seen throughout the 20th century. I do agree that did fail- from a human rights, human development, and sustainability framework. 

What Marx and Engels brought to Socialist theory was a new framework called ""Dialectics"". Going from that, we have first Historical and second Material. 

Using these frameworks, ""communism"" was born and the dictatorship of the proletariat is their new standard, abolishing the Locke theory of ""consent of the governed"". 

WITH ALL THAT out of the way, you're talking the wrong points to me. I come from Anarchist roots. I read Pyotr Kropotkin, Proudhon, Noam Chomsky, Michael Parenti, Michael Foucault, and other critics of capitalism- critics that did not employ Marxist frameworks as their entire foundation, like Vladmir lenin did. 

We need to clear the air on 2 things. 

1) Yes my examples were badly explained. Let me explain the ""concessions"" made after the great depression under FDR. Socialist movements and Workers Unions had gained massive momentum, calling for not only socialist reform BUT ALSO **complete democratic control of the economy**. Abolishing the absolute rule of an individual over private property specifically over manufacturing and enterprise. With the looming threat of actual socialists- and some communist- parties, FDR implemented Social Democratic policies as damage control. Taking away some of the socialists biggest grievances, without fixing the root of their ills. That is indeed something communists recognized, and were thusly vilified for in the coming decades. That is what I was referring to about socialism and rights movements. The ruling class has always been Capitalist, so they will always get the final word. If they didn't, then I couldn't say the ruling class has always been capitalist now could I?

2) Communism is a branch of Socialism. Socialism is much much older than marx. You are correct in saying Communism is defined as ""The Dictatorship of the Workers"". You are wrong to say that is also socialism. I am correct in saying Socialism is defined as ""Democratic control of the Economy"". Communists and Anarchists are BOTH socialists. One wishes to take over the state and its apparatuses to abolish it, bringing in a new ""worker"" state. Top-Down style. The other wishes to organize communities to de-legitimize the state and bring it down, establishing a much more confederate style of governing. Bottom-Up style. 

Where I think we both mistake our lack of ""knowledge"" on this issue is due to our lack of communication, obviously based on the fact this is a forum board and we only have so much care to type all this shit out for the thousandth time to another stranger. I can you see you know plenty on Communism and Social Democracy. 

What I can guess is your understanding of Philosophy intertwined in all of this is limited. I do not have many opinions on how the Government should be ran, compared to the outcomes I would like to see. That is why I am not a communist- I have no plans for material control of the world. I haven't gotten that far. 

Lastly, ""Socialism as an Ideology"" is a much broader concept than both of us can imagine. From philosophical frameworks of deconstructing reality, to political organization of forming government, and every step inbetween- Socialism is merely a critique of Liberal Democratic Capitalism. We have a long, long time to wait and see if ""socialism"" is the wrong answer to capitalism. So far, I see no other alternatives than Fascism.

conspiracy,ffdm2s4,t1_ffb27v1,1579823770.0,"Here are some quotes from a wonderful book about fascism. 

""We need a generic term for what is a general phenomenon, indeed the most important political novelty of the twentieth century: a popular movement against the Left and against liberal individualism"" (Robert Paxton ""The Anatomy of Fascism"" digital loc. 415).

“Fascism may be defined as a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion” (Robert Paxton “What is Fascism?: From the Anatomy of Fascism” digital: p. 16).

Here are some more from his book https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/182092-the-anatomy-of-fascism

To your second one, that's so horribly reductionist I don't quite know what to say. If you have 100% dismissed electoral politics, why are you attacking bernie? You don't have any specific arguments against bernie sanders nor do you have a solid framework for critiquing ""the system"" we both want to destroy. 

Lastly, and most importantly, I don't believe Bernie is the ultimate goal of having him win. He will lay the bricks in our hearts, bricks we will add onto slowly, one revolutionary at a time, until we can make significant change from the bottom up. Nobody from the top down can save us- only set the tone for what is to come.
