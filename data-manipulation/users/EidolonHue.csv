I said ""fuck those villages"", and had my starter village build wonder after wonder after wonder.  Once I built 20+ wonders, my influence circle contained nearly the entire island.  I also razed all the neutral villages when my influence reached them.  When I got my influence close enough to the enemy temple, I just dropped rocks on it until every single thing he owned was flattened.  Heresy does not go unpunished."

wartrade,fc6xjhu,t3_egj94n,1577492062.0,"To put the damage mods in perspective, I compared to a 6k riven being sold for the seer that gives damage, crit chance, and crit damage.  I figured out the scaling factor (something around 0.666) for seer -> kuva seer, and put their 6k riven in the overframe.gg builder to get a dps comparison.

[Someone else's 6k damage, crit chance, crit damage riven](https://overframe.gg/build/new/2851/kuva-seer/?bs=WzEsMjg1MSw0MCwxLFtbNDE2LDEwLDNdLFsxNDA5LDEwLDBdLFs0MTMsMTAsMV0sWzQxNSwxMCwxXSxbNDAyLDUsMF0sWzQzMSw1LDBdLFs0MjUsMTAsMV0sWzI1MDEsOCwxLFtbODQsMC4yNDU1OTgwNTcwNzM0NjY2Nl0sWzcxLDAuNzE2MjA4MzM1MzYwOTEzMl0sWzcyLDAuNjQ5NjI5NzMyNjIyMjI1M11dLFs3NywwLjUzOTAxNDg2NDI2MDQ5NTVdLDgsMSwwXSxbNDE3LDEwLDNdXV0=)    
98k sustained dps.  This builder doesn't support kuva seer's bonus elemental damage, but a +50% roll is about a +19% damage increase.  So it'd be more like ~117k sustained dps with a good roll kuva seer.

[My riven](https://overframe.gg/build/new/2851/kuva-seer/?bs=WzEsMjg1MSw0MCwxLFtbNDE2LDEwLDNdLFsxNDA5LDEwLDBdLFs0MTMsMTAsMV0sWzQxNSwxMCwxXSxbNDAyLDUsMF0sWzQzMSw1LDBdLFs0MjUsMTAsMV0sWzI1MDEsOCwxLFtbODQsMC4xNTA4ODAzODg1ODUzMDYzXSxbODUsMC43MzUzMTA0OTg0NjgzOTM2XSxbNzIsMC42NzMzMzM0MzY4MDAwMDIxXV0sWzg4LDAuNjU1NTU1NjU4NjY2NjY4NV0sMTMsMSwxXSxbNDE3LDEwLDNdXV0=)    
106k sustained dps, adjusted to a good roll kuva seer it would be **~126k sustained dps**.

Of course, you can build this differently but this build seemed the easiest to use to me in practice, and serves as a good tool for comparison.

The recoil is diminished to 67% as well, and the gun seemed to pull back down to where I was aiming so fast that it barely disrupted aim.

edit: Also the title should have been ""best three damage mods"", I'm aware the rolls themselves aren't perfect."
