Environment variables don't require a system call.  Apache can set headers from environment variables.  CGI script can maintain the value of the environment variable, making the webserver faster and removing the latency of the system calls it uses."
programming,fgv3uzz,t1_fgv2qk2,1581136373.0,"You didn't know that the server was using Apache - so don't try and pull this educational bullshit.  

CGI is a way to interface a random ass script's stdout to apache.  So they have Apache calling a random ass script.  If this script is doing anything other than reading from an environment variable it is taking 2 system calls MINIMUM.  Plus setup and teardown time.  

So the CGI script is just a script.  

If the CGI script was running in a while loop, setting an environment variable on each loop, the webserver could access this super accurate time with zero system calls.  


If you can read this website's code and look at me with a straight face and say 'the developers knew what they were doing', well, I think you might be beyond hope."

programming,fgv0u92,t1_fgv0003,1581134008.0,"Edit:  Read the response headers on the site.  It is served via apache.

Well that's a long way to write ""I didn't know that you could configure apache to read a header from an environment variable"".

The time is a decimal string of this format:

1581133422221293

This is short enough to fit conveniently within a header.  

If you configure Apache (the webserver used by this particular service) you can have a process running constantly updating the environment variable on the system.  Apache, being naturally on the system it is running on - will then be able to set the content of the response headers based on these accurate variables.  

This will remove the additional time skew of process startup and interprocess communication from the system, increasing the accuracy.  


It is most likely that the CGI script itself is reading from system time, and we are seeing an additional process created (with overheads) for the sole purpose of reading system time, or an environment variable, or for reading a mmapped file (another system call!  oh my!  So efficient).  


And all this on an endpoint prefixed with zzz__, which is in my experience the prefix used by contractors to denote a deprecated variable."
programming,fguyoma,t1_fguxndn,1581132449.0,"?  

Configure apache to set headers from environment variables.  Create a dedicated listener rather than CGI scripts.  Anything other than a fresh process for every request.  

I mean given their XML time parameters are inexplicably time2 and time3 and are explicitly directed from a domparsed xml.  


They set time based on setinterval - every 10 minutes.  Between pageload and 10 minutes you are displaying system time skew."

Good design changes.  The code is bad.  There are better ways to zero pad numbers.  Alert boxes are bad practice - use a modal or fixed div.  Is the time endpoint proper?  zzz__ suggests that this is an old version of the time endpoint.

politics,fgtqzmx,t1_fgtlab4,1581108172.0,"Not OP, but consider that, similar to the WW2 death toll where a substantial portion of the deaths were en route, on capture of a slavic village, or were power vacuum deaths the War on Terror has caused many serious knock on effects that lead to casualties not counted in typical scores.  


As an example, the displacement of Islamist groups from Iraq and Afghanistan lead to almost all Pakistani tribal lands becoming out of reach of the Pakistani government.  This lead to an increase in internal conflicts which were directly part of the fractured 'ganglike' structure of Islamist leadership.  This was frequently violent and actually came to a head I think in 2010 where wide swaths of Pakistan fell under Islamist control.  


Similarly, displaced Islamist groups became major players in the dynamics of many African countries.  


The odd nature of todays wars is that fighting an insurgent force is like trying to fight a bowl of small pox in a crowded room with an acetylene torch.  Yes you will succeed in having the bowl sterilised, but is the situation any better for it?   


The most likely death toll in Iraq/Afghanistan is probably 1-2 million (most estimates are conservative).  I can easily see a world where the overall death toll that can be directly attributed to the surge in Islamist strength is several times higher than that.  


I personally consider this to be the set of deaths attributable to the War on Terror, as the rise in Islamist strength can be directly tracked to the day thay the Iraq military was disbanded and sent home weapons in hand.  


Hundreds of thousands of people returning home, their only skill fighting, now unemployed with a nice assault rifle?  That was the recruiting pool for Islamist groups for years, and then they had youth who had grown up knowing only war and occupation to recruit from."

Of course our media (including CBC our taxpayer funded news organisation) picks the easy story.  It's easy to pick a side (for either side) in protester vs police.  Law and order people have the justification that the police are just fulfilling their mandate of executing legal decisions.  Fair.  People against the pipelines support the protesters for peaceful protest and civil disobedience.

Of course the SCC of Canada didn't give him a red cent in rulings regarding the status of his current incarceration in the US.  If a police officer is harassing you and gives you a ticket, when you go to the court date for the ticket the judge won't give you a settlement there, to the applause of the audience.  No - the judge will rule the ticket is improper and another judge will rule on the separate legal claim of harassment.
