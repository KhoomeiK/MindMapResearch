Then, you use your better wages to buy property in other parts of the country and price us out of the market. You think so much of yourself and so little of the rest of us, of course we hate you arrogant pricks. Some insignificant little town in the south east corner of the country gets all the attention, and the rest of us have to live with it. You're so far out of touch, you have no understanding of the issues facing the rest of the country. I'd be happy to build a wall around London and let them stay in the EU, while the rest of us get out from under the Westminster yoke. The rest of the UK would be fine without the bloody City fucking us over, whereas we provide all the products including food that London needs to survive. London and the Home Counties are so obsessed with their own worth, they don't understand the issues that the rest of the country faces. That's why we hate you."

He had a deployment overseas for 6 months, during which time some friends, including my Dad, decided to play a joke on him. They spent several days shortly before the friend's return painting the house. Not a normal colour. Not just one colour. No, they painted it purple with bright yellow spots all over. No subtlety involved in the slightest. Thing was, the submariner couldn't be bothered to repaint it, so it stayed painted like that for several years. It became a local land mark, with even taxi drivers using it for directions - known locally as the Mr Blobby House. Now that's what you call a funny, harmless prank."
