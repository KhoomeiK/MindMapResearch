You cant put a price on reputation, though.  Well, you can, but CDPR's price is extraordinarily high right now.  They literally shit gold - so long as they maintain their reputation as a god-tier developer.

There is no other developer that exists right now which holds as much good will with gamers are CDPR.  *Maybe* ID software... but thats a much more niche market."

todayilearned,femyvkz,t1_femuge7,1579273121.0,"You guys are way over thinking this.  While its true a printer may imprint some sort of identification marking, you still need to connect that identifier to the person.  Thats the weak link in the chain to exploit.

It would be as simple as traveling to a distant city and buying a used printer off craigslist with a burner phone, or if you wanted to really simplify the situation - burgling a printer from somewhere without cameras."

So... the contractor built the track to spec, within the allowable tolerances, but now the transit authority says it isnt good enough and they want parts redone?  and they're fighting over whos going to pay for it?

lol... so typical."

The whole story isnt bullshit... his wife dying and him being irritated about the slow communication is true.  The timescales and facts are off though I'm pretty sure.... it was something more like he got word his wife was ill, so he headed home... only to find she was dead and buried when he arrived home like several weeks later."
