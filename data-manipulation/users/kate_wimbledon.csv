It's like our people don't realize that we, too, are victims of racist oppression and perpetuating racism like that isn't okay. Can you talk to your brother about this and let him know what you think? It might help to emphasize that just because Mom says it's okay, doesn't mean it actually is of course.

Do you have another adult family member in your family that you trust to talk about this with? And yes, definitely talk to some professionals like your guidance counselor or therapist. Do not be afraid to lay down boundaries, that is your RIGHT. If your family is trying to get you to be in the same room with him etc and you don't want to, you have a right to hold your boundaries to stay safe. Don't be afraid to make a scene or even say what you're feeling-- if he makes another inappropriate comment you can even say, outloud, ""That makes me uncomfortable"" or ""What do you mean by that?"" There is nothing wrong with making a scene. Calling out predators in front of others can sometimes help but not everyone can do this of course.

Nothing you did was wrong. I'm really sorry this has impacted you in this way. Is this something you can talk about with a different mental health provider? It's a lot to keep to oneself. 
I hope you continue to heal and grow! <3"

To be trans means you do not identify with the gender you were assigned at birth with. For example, I was determined to be a ""girl"" at birth and I agree with that. So I identify as a cis lady. If i were a trans man I would say as such. *You don't have to be one or the other.* Identity is fluid and some people don't identify as either a woman, or a man, sometimes they have both traits or neither at all."
