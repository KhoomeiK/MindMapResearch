violinist,ff4qf95,t3_erl2q2,1579569954.0,I think a lot of violinists just leave it off completely. I wonder why Bruch would write something that is impossible. Here's a theory: it's actually a typo and G should be trilled to A and the C# sustained. It's harmonically correct and playable.
classicalmusic,feyzw3l,t3_equhcl,1579452537.0,"For pops concerts, we always play a prepared encore. For classic concerts, we occasionally do, and it's always prepared. We opened last year with Also Sprach Zarathustra, and played the Blue Danube as an enocore (the connection is that both were featured in 2001, A Space Odyssey). 

It usually takes three curtain calls for a soloist to take an encore. Many do, but a few refuse to. It's probably not because they don't have something they can play. Maybe it's because they are tired or have a hot date afterwards. Our last soloist, Sean Chen, had a perfect encore for his performance of Saint-Saëns Piano Concerto No. 2: the Godowsky arrangement of Saint-Saëns The Swan."

violinist,fe5pdkq,t3_env7ct,1578872517.0,One approach is to have your shifts coincide with the first note of each measure. Start in first. Shift to 4th position on the A that starts the third measure. Shift to 6th position on the G that starts the next measure. Shift to 8th position on the F that starts the nest measure. Shift to 10th position on the next A to set you up for a 23 trill.
violinist,fdu3egy,t3_en21do,1578726820.0,"I’d probably start in third, go to second in the fifth measure, and either stay there or go back to third. I don’t know for sure without trying it out. Check out the violinist in [this video.](https://youtu.be/b_YHE4Sx-08)

Edit: I once had a beginning student who wanted to play this. I transposed it up a half-step, and got him an audio track to play along with that was transposed up similarly."

cats,fczdird,t3_ejnmpt,1578098771.0,"When I was a kid, I was delighted by the names of the cats of one of my father’s colleagues. They were named for kinds of alcoholic drinks: Smirnoff, Bacardi, and Chablis. 

I decided then that when I got cats of my own, they would have thematic names. My mother did not want pets, so my sisters and I had to wait until we moved out to get cats. 

My first cat, a black manx, was named Tokina, after a brand of Japanese camera lenses. The joke was that she was black, compact and zoomed. I hoped to get a black male cat and name him Tamron, another Japanese lens company, but that never happened.  My current collection of three cats just have human names."
