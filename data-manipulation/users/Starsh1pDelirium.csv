GetMotivated,ffqf1qk,t1_ffqap2l,1580132666.0,Exactly. It's disgusting how quick people are ready to conveniently ignore the ugly truth and jump on the glorifying bandwagon.
LifeProTips,ffprg50,t3_euj8a4,1580103061.0,"Disagree. Just because someone dies, doesn't mean they are magically absolved of all the people they've hurt and all the harm and shitty things they've done. If you've done terrible things in your life, dying doesn't transform you into a good person. A dead asshole is still an asshole."

It's entirely possible if you don't care about pop culture because it's not your thing, read/seek other types of media and/or reserve your attention to the things that actually matter to you. That doesn't automatically make someone a recluse/sheltered. Get over yourself, friend."

`When you’re already in a compromised position, weighing the pro’s and con’s has more weight to it, because there’s more at stake.` 

This right here resonates deeply. As someone who got a late ADD diagnosis in my thirties (I also have anxiety/depression/hypothyroidism, a nice cocktail for low energy and motivation), I'm still unpacking a lot of bullshit beliefs and defense mecanisms I've accumulated throughout the years. 

I didn't have a great relationship with my parents to begin with (let's just say I was perpetually walking on egg shells due to their unpredictable/unstable nature, constant yelling, and learning at a very young age they could not be trusted with my safety and well-being), they didn't understand how that affected and hindered me in day-to-day tasks. That only added fear and trust issues in the mix. 

Over the years, I just accepted that I was the disappointing, lazy individual they said I was and made sure to remind me everyday. The ADD diagnosis was a lightbulb ""this explains a lot"" moment for me, but that was far from a cure: the deeply ingrained damage to my self-worth was not going anywhere unless I had the mental strength, will and stamina to confront and tear it down piece by piece. It's an ongoing battle, years in the making.

Always seeking safety/comfort became my default mode to survive a stressful childhood where I never did anything right. Being passive to avoid detection, either from bullies or my screaming parents, became the norm and that unfortunately followed me through adulthood. I see that more clearly now, and understand that this pattern of behavior no longer serves me. 

It's easy to slip back and put myself down sometimes, thinking I should have my shit together by now, that my progress is too slow, that it seems so easy for others, and that I should ''just'' do the thing/get started already. Your post reminded me that I've come a long way already and to value the tremendous hard work I was able to do, given my compromised position in childhood and today, still fighting my demons. Thank you, I will definitely be following your upcoming posts!"

Yeah, that's harassment."
witchcraft,fcnvyys,t3_ehyh9f,1577819530.0,"This should be pinned up top. It's not cute, it's infantilizing yourself, and reminiscent of how men say ""baby"" ""girl"" in a patronizing way. It undermines women by perpetually seeing them as vulnerable, immature creatures stuck in childhood, too dumb and helpless to make decisions or take care of themselves.

Additionally, why would the name/term/level of knowledge need to be cute? When learning a new skill or hobby, would you really call yourself a baby painter, baby carpenter, baby gardener/designer/electrician/dancer/etc? Or would you simply say you're at a beginner/novice level?"
