*Your* country is propping up the military industrial complex above all and has destabilized nations and states to gain resources for decades.

LifeProTips,ffdlzow,t1_ffbrm1p,1579823717.0,"The graph below the supposed 1% graph is better, it shows how many Brits thought Europe is an issue, in 2015 it's quite low (10-15%). I think that gets the point across just fine, and uses better data.

 1% is just ridiculous IMO, that survey must have been skewed in some way. It does say 1% said Europe was ""most crucial"" and we don't know what other options were presented."
indieheads,ffdihxp,t1_ffdho4c,1579821580.0,Radiohead without Thom Yorke would be worse off and his writing carries many songs. I get this is basically a shitpost but I cannot endorse. Guy wrote and sang Dawn Chorus recently so I'll give him a pass for any poor writing he did in 1998.
