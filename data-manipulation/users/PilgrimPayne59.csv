EntitledPeople,fff1wnd,t3_et8ono,1579873447.0,"First, I really am sorry that your friend was treated poorly by these people.

But, second, this subreddit is really starting to pile up with tales that are basically as follows:
1) Someone gets treated badly
2) That person’s feelings get hurt
3) That person runs off somewhere and bursts into tears
4) Op evidently gets to feel better because he/she vented about it

I do not think that this subreddit was created just to express what people are feeling when they are treated like dirt. I do not think this is somewhere to vent when things go bad for you or a friend. I understand that there might be a need for a subreddit like that, but I feel that this subreddit is NOT the place for this.

People who subscribe to this subreddit are looking for the entitled jerks to get some kind of comeuppance at the end of these stories.

If you want to just vent so you can emotionally feel better, may I suggest that someone start a subreddit called coffeeklatch or touchy-feely or something like that."
