AskReddit,fdfxqj2,t1_fden3bp,1578373134.0,"Yup, it's hard to swallow, but the truth is that large swaths of our country are far more conservative than we like to admit most times. The first fathers in the middle of the country and the south who would be left at home to care for their kids alone because the mothers were unwillingly drafted first would raise holy hell and people would actually pay attention to them instead of giving poetic names like ""War widows"" and romanticizing the idea."

I mean, in fairness I've probably read the same book because WWII and the rise of fascism in the 20th century is a subject that's always fascinated me, but if I'm gonna sit down and do an interview with someone it wouldn't be the first book I admit to reading regularly nor would I keep anything like that close at hand for quick and easy reference.
