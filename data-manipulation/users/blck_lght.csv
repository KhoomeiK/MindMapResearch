Edit: here’s a short video I made last time this challenge was around, https://youtu.be/4k9u3Zumc0c when someone was claiming that you need to lasso and release an NPC for them to become an “enemy”, and I said it wasn’t the case. Pardon me switching outfits mid p-action, offhand holster glitched and I didn’t wanna shoot with the sawed off

Edit 2: birds that can be skinned also count toward the “20 animals skinned” challenge, so if you can’t find 20 actual animals, go for those ducks and turkeys. Ravens apparently don’t count, because they can only be “plucked”, not skinned"
