Craig Wright caused havoc and massive economic destruction right here in this community because people were willing to embrace him and his astroturfing shills just so long as they kept saying BCH is better than BTC. 

Kim dot com is a self-aggrandising prick whose entire claim to fame is that he’s made a bunch of money from enabling piracy. He’s not some business or tech genius. He just did something that most people knew was massively open to abuse and would inevitably get shut down and likely sued. 

Everybody here knows this. But so long as he says BCH is better than BTC people will treat him like an idol. It’s fucking tragic that people can’t learn from their mistakes."

I’m not trying to crap on the show in any way, it’s great. But I think one of the worst things that can happen to a great show is for a toxic fandom to develop. People can and should just appreciate the show for what it is without feeling this need to shit all over other shows and films. 

Here’s the thought I had last time this discussion came up:

Every galaxy spanning sci-fi show has to solve the same problem; how do we travel light-years between solar systems?

In Star Trek they have warp drive, wormholes, trans warp conduits etc.

In battlestar galactica they had FTL jump drives.

I’ve seen people here criticise Stargate as being particularly campy and silly. Which is fair because their interstellar travel solution was a network of magical “ring gates” built by some ancient super advanced species. I mean what kind of a handwavy cop out explanation is that? Right? Right guys... who think the expanse is rock solid hard sci-fi...?"
TheExpanse,fetny66,t1_feta3vm,1579377404.0,"> Technology we have today would have been considered magic 300 years ago

The same rules apply to warp drives, or FTL jump drives, or artificial gravity, or inertial dampeners, or phasers, or lightsabers. By the logic you are applying, all sci-fi is hard sci-fi."
TheExpanse,fetlm8w,t1_fet9hm7,1579376645.0,"> About the only ""cheat"" they propose is...

The Epstein drive, some gloopy embalming fluid that allows them to survive cripplingly high g-forces, and of course the protomolecule which breaks or suspends the laws of physics almost everytime it appears.

That’s at least three cheats, one of which is pretty much a “god molecule” that can do whatever they need it to in order to advance the storyline.

I like the show as much as the next guy. But these gushing posts about how real everything is (and how shit all other sci-fi is by comparison) really annoy me."

btc,fer38wb,t3_eqdxvs,1579349240.0,"Yes, if everyone in the world adopted BCH (rather than one of the many many other cryptocurrencies) then international money transfer would be super simple.

But the exact same can be said about any of the systems listed on that page. The difficulty you are alluding to exists because different systems have been adopted in different places. There’s no more reason to think all those places will unify around one particular cryptocurrency than to think they would all adopt Swift."
bsv,fekwiy5,t1_fekuxbm,1579209063.0,"> Why? Why should I give up on something that belongs to me?

It doesn’t belong to you. They warned you before the fork to withdraw your coins if you wanted to guarantee you would get both forks. You likely didn’t care at the time, expecting CraigCoin to die almost immediately. Just because Craig and Calvin have propped it up doesn’t mean that Bitstamp’s position has changed."
bsv,fekrerz,t1_fekob22,1579206046.0,"I understand your frustration, which is likely driven entirely by this artificial spike in the price of BSV. But my point is simple. The exchange didn’t promise you anything. They don’t owe you anything. You’re attempting to drum up social media attention to force them to give you “your BSV” when they were pretty clear that they couldn’t promise to do that.

This is the closing point from your own link:

> Bitstamp may choose not to credit alternative forked coins related to this event. Customers who would like to have the option to preserve/claim coins on alternative chains should withdraw their BCH before we disable withdrawals on 15 November.

Just learn from your mistake already and stop blaming others."

bsv,fejboc3,t1_fejam4x,1579165910.0,"Nobody outside of Craig’s cult believes it’s actually worth a significant amount. But that’s beside the point.

The exchanges can’t put themselves in a position where they are expected to support forks by default. It would crush them."
bsv,fehrmgn,t1_feg2wcs,1579122499.0,It sounds to me like they made zero guarantees that customers would ever be able to access the BSV. You can’t reasonably expect exchanges or any other custodial service to support every fork. Literally anyone can create a fork of BTC or BCH or even BSV at any time. But an exchange that tried to support every one of them would be buried in the administrative costs of doing so.

Some would argue that’s exactly what happened with Blockstream. A bunch of protocol developers whipped up a huge pile of funding so they could work on Bitcoin without worrying about their bills or politics. Ultimately that resulted in either:

1. They became detached from the desires and needs of the wider community and more and more certain that their internally agreed path was correct. 

2. They potentially became beholden to the people who provided the funding.

3. Probably a bit of both 1 and 2.
