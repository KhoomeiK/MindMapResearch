That just isn't it.  Women want to be completely warm and toasty in yoga pants and a low v neck fitted tshirt in their own home in winter.  There is a culture of showing off as much skin as they can, and clearly demonstrating their shape.  Skin tight clothes that preclude any insulation despite weather that indicates they should dress otherwise. Suggest that they put on a jacket and wear warmer layers and they will have a hissy fit and/or declare you wearing a warm jacket indoors to be an indicator of poverty. Why?  I don't know.  Ask an anthropologist.

That typically means that the environment has to be at 85f.

In a house that barely sustains 65f, on a concrete slab, with unsealed door frames, roof hot spots, with windchill probably feels like 55f.  Women are freaking miserable at that temperature.

It's relatively speaking, very big and very heavy. The big size of the BT circuit board show potential of hacks to use the mic of an earphone instead of the mic on the BT board itself.

My rig only has an on button, so all controls have to be from the phone.  Also all these $2 receivers are mono.  No exceptions.  I've tried them all.  And I haven't tried the more expensive ones because the mic always has to be on the receiver with dubious potential to be able to use the inline mic.

Still searching.  Just needs to be cheap and stereo.  My audio tastes are thankfully very simple."

I do miss the small size of the original receiver.  The size of a mini lighter.  However, it's interesting how a mega battery changes the 'anxiety' I have of 'did I charge?' 'when will it die?' to 'just use it' 'it's going to last forever'

Best I got from it was that they are 'same enough' and since the battery capacity is so much larger than the charge rate, it probably won't explode if I charge it for an hour at most, and even at just an hour, that will be enough charge for weeks.

I don't think the voltage or current of the bluetooth receiver is enough to heat up the liion battery enough to explode.  Which, also, i'm sure that if the internal resistance of the battery is too high, it won't accept the charge from the BT anyways."

In addition to the fact that the reason the screw holes swelled was the fact that the screws were overdriven, thereby creating a pocket for water to accumulate in the first place, do you think the fastening power of the screw is compromised?

Is that enough proof?  Is that something you noticed also?  Or completely missed....

It's generally recognized by all that osb has a kryptonite and that is moisture.  Of course most houses have the same problem, but sips are particularly vulnerable because they are made out of osb, *which just doesn't do well with long term exposure to moisture.*"
