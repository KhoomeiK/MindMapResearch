ftm,fdaih9r,t1_fdah46v,1578246490.0,thank you!
bulletjournal,fcpqoag,t3_eiff2k,1577870050.0,i really like this idea! i hadn’t thought to take the “year in pixels” type of spread to use to track symptoms. it seems like it would be super helpful! i hope you have a happy new year! :)
ftm,fcpompv,t1_fcpo3hr,1577868804.0,"yep, that’s it! i remember now; they were out of the black ones which is why i ordered the tortoiseshell ones. they said they were limited edition so i wanted to get them before they were out, but i guess they decided to keep selling them because i got them in september of 2018. a lot of people either noticed immediately that they were different shapes, or didn’t notice for the longest time haha. have a happy new year, man!"
ftm,fcpkhhf,t3_eid4be,1577866326.0,"i have the same glasses, but in a calico/turtle colour (however they call it??) they look awesome on you!"

ftm,fcmg7n2,t3_ehsndr,1577774073.0,"amazing name dude!! (considering i’m also a greyson, i might be biased) very happy for you. :)"
bulletjournal,fbwetfx,t1_fbwemkc,1577148041.0,"honestly, i’m so happy that i found a bujo that doesn’t ghost or bleed, even when i go over lines again and again or colour something in. glad you like it too! happy bujo-ing! again, your spread looks awesome; would love to see more spreads like these from you in the future! :)"
bulletjournal,fbweh5p,t1_fbweedp,1577147784.0,yep! i could tell by the bookmarks and the pen holder. we have the same colour! i just got it a few weeks ago and just started using it this week. i absolutely love it! do you?
bulletjournal,fbwecw0,t3_eelxbq,1577147695.0,"looks amazing, and LOVE the panic! reference. also, we have the exact same bujo!"
ftm,f7d840z,t1_f7bdoyu,1573610043.0,rip i’m a greyson. didn’t think it was too common of a name but i know two graysons that are trans online and recently met a trans guy named gray in person at my university who is in the same major as me. sent a real shock through me lmao. one of them literally has the same initials as me haha. guess i truly am part of the common name list rip
