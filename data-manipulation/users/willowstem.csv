VRchat,fffebxe,t1_fff9c5b,1579882097.0,"it's always been around. I started about a year ago, and I've seen it since the beginning. That's not to say it happens all the time. I haven't seen it often, but I still find someone like that from time to time. It's just like real life. People are like that everywhere, even in the digital world."
VRchat,fffdvta,t1_fff38kx,1579881805.0,"there are people that can hate on anything because they're elitist pricks. I was once in a dance club and had a group of people rag on me for having a potato computer and that I should just leave because I complained about my frame rate dropping with all the particle effects. My computer wasn't even that bad, but I didn't spend $4k on it, so obviously it's a total piece of shit. There are entitled people everywhere that feel like others are lesser than them if they don't have these high class accessories, whether it be fancy custom models, a high end PC, Supreme wear, or a Mercedes S class."
VRchat,fffcrjy,t1_ffevilk,1579881102.0,"good, then they made it easy that you didn't have to deal their stuck-up ass for long. Leaves less time dealing with figuring out if that person was an asshole or not. Now you have more time to find more friends that actually care about you for who you are, and not some fucked up elitist bullshit like whether or not you have a custom made avatar."

AskWomen,ff6q1ul,t3_ersqnd,1579632498.0,"Shaving was the biggest time consumer for me. I would sometimes do it in a bath the night before so I wouldn't have to worry about it the next day, but I eventually switched to epilating. It hurts, but you get used to it, and I don't have to worry about it as often. Just a touch up every few days.

Other than that, just being in a rush in general helps. I'm always cutting it close to the time I have to leave."

Remember, that's propulsion gel surrounding that little guy, and any minor acceleration applied to that thing will make that it just shoot out of you like an oversized cube-shaped BB, possibly taking out the whole front of your cranium along with it. Best to just wait it out. Seriously, might want to get comfy and not move for the next 24 hours until that sucker passes...but when it does pass...well, let's just say it's a good thing plumbing expenses are covered under the liability insurance you signed up for when you arrived."

Some nights I would just move into the other room to sleep on the couch, but then she would get mad that she didn't get to wake up next to me. So I stuck with it, or would just gently wake her, but she'd quickly fall back to sleep and start snoring again anyway."
