The furnace, water heater and all the appliances were 25 years old, so I was worried about any unexpected expense. 

I purchased a monthly service plan from the utility company for the first two years to cover repairs and replacement on the major appliances—furnace, water heater, and refrigerator. I know such contracts are generally an imprudent expense, but the peace of mind was worth every penny. In the end, though, I got more in maintenance and repair services than I paid in. 

Now I have all the major appliances on a depreciation schedule, so in addition to paying into a household slush fund, I set aside a specific amount to be able to replace them at the time of their life expectancy.

Yes, the looser the gauge, the flatter the cable. 

Blocking isn’t the answer here. Blocking would make the cabling even less dimensional. 

Consciously trying to change your tension by pulling the yarn tighter rarely works. Instead, try a different needle size or how you wrap the yarn over your fingers. If you wrap yarn over your pinky, for instance, try wrapping it twice. 

Also, check where you actually make the new stitch on your right needle. For consistently sized stitches, you want to be wrapping the needle around the full shaft of the needle, not the tip. If you enter the new stitch shallowly, the new stitch gets formed around the smaller diameter of the tip. Your tension will be tighter because when the stitch gets pushed up off the tip, it will be tighter—it stretches to fit the full diameter of the needle. 

If you consistently knit towards the needle tips, you will probably prefer a blunter needle with a shorter taper. This will not only make it easier to get recommended gauge with any given yarn, but will also feel more natural."

BTW, collars were once totally detachable, mostly to facilitate laundering. During the frugal times of WW2, dresses were made with an attached collar but often came with several additional over-collars which could be buttoned in place to change the style of the garment while still economizing. 

I sew some of my own clothes, and alter RTW clothing to suit me better. One thing I like to do is to sew a velveteen, fleece or corduroy over collar on outer wear that requires dry cleaning or special laundering, like a down jacket. It saves a lot of money and resources to remove and launder just the collar. A fleece collar against the neck is also a lot more comfortable than wool."

People are extremely sensitive about this here. I once received a gift of earrings with a Native American design from the staff  of the tight-knit Native American organization I worked at, for an employment anniversary. (I was the only non-Native person.) I put the earrings on, and it became clear that wearing them offended some of my colleagues.

Honestly, people here are salty about white people having dreadlocks, or non-Muslim women wearing flowing headscarves or really anyone wearing an outfit that’s strongly identified with another culture which is not there own.

TrueOffMyChest,fgh0tey,t1_fggrnkq,1580773996.0,"You’re right, pride is what you feel for an accomplishment you’ve achieved, not what you may feel for possessing a specific trait. It makes as much sense to feel proud of being gay as it does to feel proud of having green eyes or having high intelligence. Being proud of putting together a smash outfit to coordinate with green eyes in a flattering way, or to earn an academic award using that intelligence, would be more to the point. 

But Pride festivals aren’t about being gay, exactly. They’re more about having the courage to express oneself authentically in the face of social condemnation. Thinking back to when Pride started, it took a lot of inner strength, and a supportive community, to be able to do that. There were real risks to exposing yourself as homosexual. To enact the personal character to do that was indeed something which was admirable and something of which to be proud. 

It’s less dangerous to be homo now, but there’s still a lot of disapproval and hostility to be faced when coming or being out. Sexual orientation is a trait, but standing up to endorse the right of its expression, that should indeed inspire pride. 

Pride festivals started as a countermeasure against unjust social norms, and yes, may have become more celebratory than activist as those norms have softened. But, that activist history and the change it has wrought is also worthy of pride."

Most importantly, avoid bringing new bacteria into the area, or spreading the germs that are already there elsewhere to your body. Don’t pick at it. Wash your hands before and after applying the compresses, and use a fresh compress each time. Change your shirt each day.

I was disappointed in the disruption of my solitude and planned to move on the next day. But that evening a delegation came over, mentioning they had noticed my solitary camp, and invited me to join them for supper and  a sing-along. I went.
