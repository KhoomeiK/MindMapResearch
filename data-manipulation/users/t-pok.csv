funny,fcnvki3,t3_ei754o,1577819295.0,There should be a couple treadmills and a punch card so you can earn some free drinks if you actually run some miles.
cats,fcnuty0,t3_ehtw3r,1577818862.0,"I have almost the same issue. First I got a kitten from a rescue facility, then about 3 weeks later, I adopted a 3 year old from a rehoming page on Facebook. The 3 year old does not like the kitten, and at first was hissing and growling every time the kitten got too close. I think the kitten just wants to play. 

That was 2 months ago, and they are still not friends, but the kitten can get a lot closer to the 3 year old before she growls. I have seen a few mild fights, but nothing that looked dangerous. They usually slap at each other a few times and then one of them walks away. 

I read an article somewhere that they can take up to 8 months to become friends, but in some cases, they may just learn to ignore each other. I am still hopeful that mine will become friends.  Don’t give up yet!"

I always have to re-wet (just a light mist) and re-scrunch my hair in the morning, but don’t usually have to add more products."
excel,fc5luq8,t3_eg9vag,1577461031.0,Can you use your pivot table to show a count instead of a sum? Or maybe I am misunderstanding your goal.
LifeProTips,fc5jion,t3_eg2psv,1577459314.0,"Now I need whiskey rocks :)  I have a coworker with a French press who is always trying out new flavors at work, and he makes extra for the surrounding employees to try. So I don’t have control over how hot it is, but I can cool down my own cup. Love this idea!"

cats,fc3n4nm,t3_eg0rpg,1577393679.0,"I think this is normal.  Cats take awhile to get used to the smells of a new home. Mine hid under a chair for 3 days, and then she moved to a different room and hid under the bed in there for a few more days. It’s like they are learning the smells of each room, as well as the amount of human traffic that is happening. She probably finds the conservatory the safest or calmest for now, but will gradually take over the whole house :)"
