Gangstalking,ffijsnl,t1_ffij1n9,1579975557.0,It could be the focus is on what you are focusing on or on what you fear could be true. Is there a way to redirect?
Showerthoughts,fe7za9d,t1_fe7xyag,1578920768.0,"When you give to others, in time or help or money, what are the circumstances?"
antiwork,fe7xv5o,t1_fe7sj74,1578920375.0,"Preach. I didn't even get the $300 and spent about $1k of my own money in the beginning, not to mention the $40k+ after scholarship for the education. Any time off was spent in service, the classrooms were moldy, the administrators came in angry the first month because the scores weren't skyrocketing (my class was the one that went from a D to a C), one day  (and two if the scores didn't rise) of the month was eaten by testing, and there was very little support and much telling what they wanted to see without offering how to solve the problems. It's not worth going back, much as I love teaching."
SuicideWatch,fdo3mqb,t1_fdo33c6,1578598283.0,"Also, note that you read the note I gave and then gave the ""I can't."" I can't, I can't - it's so easy and ""truthful."" You are worth your I can. I can do this. I can move. I can walk. I can help. I can find places of meaning. I can do. It may take a lot more trying - 50 more applications or tries. Later, 50 more dates and rejections. You are worth fighting for. Nerdiness: it reminds me a bit of Neville Longbottom from Harry Potter. All those times when he was bullied and couldn't do and couldn't do - his grandparents and classmates discounted him. In the end, he wins. It takes a whole time at school and a broken wand, but he does win in the end. He says ""I'm worth two of you, Malfoy"" when he stands up to the bully. You stand up to the bully within yourself. You're worth more."
SuicideWatch,fdo33c6,t1_fdo0iyr,1578598004.0,"If you look at all the cities in the country on Craigslist, there are places where people rent rooms for free (or with a stipend) and ask for help in the home. If you give the background you gave on Reddit, with a voice of hope that you can make a better future for yourself, someone will listen to you. You don't need religion religion - just knowledge that something better is available. For me, that knowledge is that there is a good that can be reached (Jesus, for others Buddha, etc.). For you, you may say it a different way. Love."
SuicideWatch,fdnxo8a,t3_em8cip,1578594947.0,"You write really well for a person who learned to read at a late age! Are you stuck where you are? Could you move to a place where you can get an Uber and possibly a place with a way to exercise and living with someone who is kinder to you? You can also start volunteering - it may help you feel more of value if you are helping others to maintain their value. Also, you could attend a church or other service that may help you - Unitarian, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or whatever group or place that helps you aspire to a greater good. Or there are sermons or audiobooks online. There is also counseling available through various places, and you're more likely to get those in a larger area. Also, there is the positive thought idea. If you think to yourself how you very much want something good, and you think that you can get it, then that may help. To be successful helping through volunteering may be one step. Then to be successful by walking a mile a day may be a next step. Then to be successful by talking to someone you may not have talked with may be a next step. Each step forward is something for which you deserve credit. Good luck!"
