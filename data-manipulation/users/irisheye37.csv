First of all I take all 3 limits as I don't see them as such a big deal.

So that leaves me with 3 boons and effectively 9 points.

**Your childhood:** Enhanced learning is always extremely powerful plus I'm less likely to become depressed if I always have childlike wonder.

**Your life:** Endless adventure will ensure I never become bored and will always have friends.

**Our life:** High fantasy yes please. Even if I end up looking like the picture it won't be a big deal due to taking shape shifting later on.

Now onto the perks. First of all I lock out Unlimited Adventures to fulfill my limit. 

**Unlimited Justice:** The only perk I take here is *Soldier of Fortune* to feed the rpg feeling.

**Unlimited Exploration:** I take everything is this section for 2 points by using my limit to halve the cost. It is all extremely useful powers for a life of adventure and will ensure I don't get trapped somewhere for all of eternity.

**Unlimited desire:** I take both Dye perks. Shape shifting for variety and mind control for amusement. 

**Unlimited Imagination:** I take both arts and crafts. Art's because hopefully it includes martial arts and crafts so I can make bitchin weapons/armor for me and my friends."
