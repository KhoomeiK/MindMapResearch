politics,ff7b22f,t1_ff7aqs7,1579645143.0,"You can but from a quick glance at the legislation proposed its any firearm designed to carry more than 7 rounds is now illegal. Which is why I explained guns aren’t necessarily designed to carry a certain magazine size but almost all firearms can accommodate for larger sizes so are those now illegal? It’s more the wording than anything. To the first point it’s still a confiscation as you’re not rewarded anything for turning in the now illegal attachments or be a class 6 felon, and anyway how do you enforce that? Do you have police go door to door to every firearm owners house and have them check what mags you have? Obviously nothing has passed yet but I’m speaking as if they have just for the sake of this conversation. I just think the aim is at the wrong things, limiting magazine size isn’t going to stop a crazy person from shooting up a school. We should focus on why it’s so easy for some to obtain illegal firearms in the first place, rather than banning them from people who haven’t done anything wrong. 

Ok just reread and the felony is only for shotguns it’s a class 1 misdemeanor for possessing mags over 10"

Seems like forced compliance, sacrifice your second amendment right by possessing what has been banned(nothing is grandfathered in) and not turn it in, or turn in whatever they made illegal which doesn’t really do much to stop gun violence and is somewhat arbitrary. Especially the “banning assault weapons designed to carry more than 7 rounds of ammunition” which isn’t really smart considering most guns aren’t designed to a set mag limit but you can purchase magazines of different sizes. So you’ve effectively made it illegal to own most firearms, as most have magazines that exceed 7rds"

If you go the non tipping method then at least your employees will be making a steady and consistent wage, but now you’ll need to slash hours because it’s becoming too expensive and eventually close down.

Democrats want to make it harder for entrepreneurship to take place(this one is more of a layered issue in trying to take on corporations, rightly so, it hurts the mom and pop stores I guess I’m more unhappy with the aim than the goal same as with gun control which I’d gladly have a discussion on either cause I don’t want to just get shit on for having opinions) republicans, specifically this administration, are exuding nationalism at a scale that should scare anyone withhalf a brain. Democrats are feeding into a fight against the first amendment in terms of acceptable speech. Both sides are feeding into overarching narratives to try and one up the other side. Neither group would like to stop the drug prohibition that has been failing since the 70’s. These are just blanket statements at the end of the day, and each candidate checks some of these and not others and vice versa, so I personally choose not to vote in  presidential elections because I feel personally whichever I vote for is actively trying to diminish some part of society that I would like to see stay for a lack of a better term. Which is why I choose to vote for state and city level representatives(senator governor, city municipal) as I feel I actually have an immediate impact on my community and state as a whole to make it a bit better than it already is. It may be short sighted it may be stupid and I could very well be an evil fuck for believing it, I’m sure I’ll catch flakk for at least one thing I listed but it’s just a personal opinion. I think politics has turned into a game of bread and circus and us vs them and it really skews what democracy is supposed to be about, and as a whole regardless of who we vote to be president there’s already 70+ years of corruption and propaganda to slow any president down from really making things better. I really liked yang but I understand that he wouldn’t be a great fit with no real experience in the political realm, I’m still waiting on Sanders’ thoughts on gun control and what his aims are to reduce the high amount of violent crime by firearms  but we’ll never get an actual answer due to how these debates are structured. It’s set up to produce sound bites and clips, and it also doesn’t help with all of this extra manufactured drama between sanders and warren.

I think a lot of that plays into they had a small budget and both of the guys aren’t actors to begin with. They didn’t have access to a lot of different places to film and actually used their jobs as main filming sites. To each their own, I have never seen triangle though gonna check it out tonight"

entertainment,fdrmox6,t1_fdrmd2l,1578686727.0,"Just edited but primer is a really great time travel movie, there’s a commentary the director made that you can listen to while watching to follow it but I really suggest you watch it blind the first time and then a second time after you’ve processed it with the commentary, it’s only about an hour and a couple minutes long. It’s a pretty difficult movie to grasp at first but they set up rules for their time travel and rarely break those rules. Also this movie is more popular but still a little cultish, memento. Not time travel but it’s a crime detective esque movie that really makes your brain hurt after watching it. The machinist with Christian bale is another really good movie a lot of people haven’t heard of. One more I can think of off the top of my head that isn’t well known to the furthest of my knowledge, coherence. Now that movie is truly a rollercoaster ride. Happy watching!"

It’s only 28 minutes long but is truly one of the greatest time travel movies I’ve watched. Also if you’re interested in good time travel movies watch primer, low budget film made by a physicist another great movie although really hard to follow on first watch."
