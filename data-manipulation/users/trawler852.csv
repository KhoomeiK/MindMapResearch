worldpolitics,ffw4sx6,t1_ffvzfs8,1580284353.0,I think you give him too much credit on knowing left from right and basic politics.
worldpolitics,ffw4ow5,t1_ffw3ja9,1580284208.0,"I'm from Australia. I keep a track of politics all the time and I worry for all of you. Whether friend or foe America is dangerous because of the lunatic leading your country. If decisions don't go his way he threatens sanctions on even Americas closest allies like Britain. Australia is also a close ally and basicly when you go to war we go too. I worry he'll drag us into a pointless war for his own whims. He's already proven he will act without forethought with his latest drone strike. He is a petty man and takes any slight serously which isn't a good combination when you have the largest military in the world. 

I think it's a very dangerous time for the regular citizens. If he gets through the impeachment then he knows he can get away with just about anything he likes. He WILL rig the elections as much as possible. What could happen if he gets another 4 years? This is how the Hitler's of our world start with a cult of personality. Heaven help you if you don't support him then."

ABoringDystopia,ffw1fwx,t1_ffvs5qh,1580280312.0,Inventive solution. I may be wrong but the problem you face is that it's all electronic so can be moved elsewhere pretty fast. Maybe have a strong conversation with your government about if they actually need 11 carriers and the groups of vessels that accompany them.

PoliticalDiscussion,ffv1xvz,t3_ev8aa1,1580253809.0,I don't think anyone would take the deal if you were in the Palestinians shoes. America sells weapons to Israel. America flouted convention on impartiality by moving their embassy to Jerusalem. At this point any deal brokered by the US is suspect and I would tear it up too.
PoliticalDiscussion,ffv16ko,t1_ffuhn5m,1580253318.0,Nah they are humanitarians they use guided missiles bought from the USA
PoliticalDiscussion,ffuz22r,t1_ffufe6b,1580252085.0,The US really needs to hand the reigns of mediation to a non biased country. After the US moved their embassy to Jerusalem they lost all credibility as an impartial arbiter. Let alone all the weapons they sell them. Hell one could say they have a vested interest in keeping the conflict going.

unpopularopinion,fftfp3d,t1_fftepao,1580219220.0,So the link you sent me to he straight up says the man was mentally ill. So it's now it's a baseball bat chair why don't you throw sime knives on it for good measure. It was a chair and if he couldn't defend himself against a chair then what the hell is he doing in the field? I would use the tazer because it's not just me there are multiple cops there to use theirs too. If there's more than one man there he shouldn't have lost his life period.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fftei1d,t1_fftbuez,1580218203.0,It used to be white Australian men but then we took the guns away. It's a lot more personal to have to take people out with knives.

unpopularopinion,ffsryqj,t1_ffrs9qt,1580190309.0,There should be no in house investigations. A separate bureau should be made to police all cops and the abc departments. All cops and abc asgents should be required to wear body cameras  and if it is faulty at the time of an incident being investigated then the onus is on the cop to prove his innocence. Holsters should be setup so it's able to record when a weapon is drawn and a report should be filled out each time a weapon is drawn.
