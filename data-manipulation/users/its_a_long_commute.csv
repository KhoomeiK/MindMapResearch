AskReddit,ffwt2fi,t3_evn0p8,1580310339.0,"overall I get along with all of them really well. My husband's parents divorced when he was a teenager and both got remarried so I have 2 sets of inlaws and both come with their sets of stresses and quirks.   

From my father in law and step mother in law it'd be her drinking. You ever see the Real Housewives of New Jersey? That's my step mother in law down to the flat ironed black hair and cheetah print. She's a sweet and generous woman, its more like she just has ridiculously unfortunate conversation habits. She'll talk over you and dominate an entire table with her conversation. She's so loud even a big table - 8+ people - tend to just fall silent and watch her talk. Her and my FIL also fight like cats and dogs when they drink too much. He's super passive aggressive and makes little digs and comments that he knows will rile her up. There's been a few uncomfortable dinners in public where she's been drinking and starting to get snippy and I know she's a glass and a half away from a drunken outburst. I used to try and mediate between the two and its really stressful. I'm learning to just keep my head down.  

From my mother in law and step dad - probably the step dad literally buying weed at my wedding shower. They both also drink too much and like to smoke weed too. That's fine, whatever. But the guy actually asked one of the servers for a joint and managed to actually get one (whether he actually got it from the server or had it on him the whole time, who knows, he lies about  *a lot* so you never really know) and was waving it around mostly-drunk and bragging to both our families about his weed the way a teenager would. It was embarrassing. My dad's pretty anti-weed and didn't find it funny aaatt all. At the welcome dinner (night before our wedding) he got SO hammered that my  now brother in law had to pull him aside and be like ""....thiiiiis is not going to be acceptable tomorrow..."". Thankfully, he held it together day of."
