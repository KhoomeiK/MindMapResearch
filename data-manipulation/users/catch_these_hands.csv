CS is a more versatile degree but MIS still has a ton of career options (database admin, developer, business analyst, tech consultant, project manager just to name a few)

The value in a business degree really relies on two things. The prestige of the school and the size of the alumni network. The combination of these two plus a little bit of networking will lead to a lucrative career."

I'm very much looking forward to moving on to bigger and better opportunities."
