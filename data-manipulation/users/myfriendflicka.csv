fightporn,ff667fj,t3_erup12,1579620102.0,I've seen this video so many times I feel like I should add it to my Christmas card mailing list.
AskReddit,ff6639g,t3_ero8mj,1579620023.0,"I was a skinny little loudmouth. After wondering how I got to be such a hulking giant, young me would probably try goad current me into beating myself senseless.  Although current me wouldn't, actually strike 13-year-old me because I'm a pacifist.  

So I guess 13 year-old me would get a firm talking to or a strongly-worded letter, which I would cc to my parents."

aww,fejrv0o,t3_eph3kv,1579184298.0,The kid's outfit and that critter's hairdo are very retro-punk rock.  They look like they're on their way to a GBH concert.

Brooklyn,f9qwyud,t1_f9oy5g5,1575568122.0,Oh geez you're right.  What's embarrassing is I used to live on 16th Street and have more memories from 2 Toms than Tom's Diner.  I loved that they always had a really okay house red and ordering was a challenge as the guy would come out and reel off everything they had in about ten seconds.  With the family style (in every sense of the word) the ideal way to eat there was to bring a group big enough that you could order and try everything.  Great food.     Also it being next to the Brooklyn Casket Company and some of those old-school Italian social clubs gave it a real feel of being a old Brooklyn time capsule.  Red Rose in Cobble Hill was another great Italian place I was sad to see go.
