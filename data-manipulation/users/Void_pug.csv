offmychest,fee8jk0,t3_eog7oh,1579028605.0,"I agree. Sure, I didn’t have a tough childhood per say, but I had a rough one. There’s a big difference. People who say that have a ROUGH childhood. I hate when people do that. Though a lot of things have changed about me during one point of my rough childhood, but that one event that was traumatic for me can happen every day to someone who had a tough childhood. (Long story short, accidentally get child family services called on my home, my step mom kicked me out of the house for two months).

I absolutely despise people who thing they have everything so much worse than others. It’s disgusting when they use it as an excuse for literally EVERYTHING.

offmychest,fe92ldh,t3_eo69sz,1578933488.0,"For the first thing, yes, that's paranoia. I can't say I don't get paranoid though. I have chronic Generalized Anxiety Disorder, so I worry about anything and everything. I would suggest trying to talk to a therapist, or if you can't access one, a school Councillor. They can't tell your parents anything unless they're concerned you'll be hurting yourself or someone else, so maybe give it a try.

For the second problem, I can also relate. I'm thirteen as well, turning fourteen on the 21st of January. I'm the top of my class in English, Band, Science and Social Studies. I'm always worried I'll mess up, my grades will go down and my parents will hate me.

But, neither of us have a reason to worry, really. Assuming that your school system works the same as where I'm from, you still have four years to get your grades up if they ever went down. About university. To be completely honest? No, you might not be accepted into that University you really want to go to. But you WILL get into a university or college, I'm sure of it. given your grades, schoolwork isn't painfully hard for you. I wouldn't be surprised if you kept those high grades up until graduation! And I'm certain you'll find a boyfriend. you sound like an amazing person. You don't have to be good with children, but I'm sure you'll get better with age. I'm certain you'll be able to get a job. because eve if you don't get into college or university, apply for a trading school! you don't need that much to get in, and they're running low on people going to trading schools to get those specific jobs, so you'll be paid really well in those jobs! Trade schools offer numerous specialized degrees and certifications in programs, such as those for automotive technology, fashion design, computers and electronics careers. Many of these programs train individuals, such as mechanics, electricians, fashion designers and secretaries, to perform job-specific duties. So, If you don't get into college or university, just apply and a trading school and you'll be set!

As mentioned though, try talking to a professional. I hope things get better for you!"
offmychest,fe8yxhe,t3_eo62bo,1578932433.0,"I can't relate to all of that, being thirteen, but I have an idea of how you feel. I have chronic GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), So I worry about literally everything. Often I don't even have a reason to worry. I just worry for no reason. Hell, I'm slightly anxious to just send this message out there. But doing this kind of stuff helps me cope.

My Family isn't the best either. they don't treat me as a disappointment necessarily, but I'm the oldest sibling who isn't suicidal, so I'm basically the mother of my family until my stepmom returns in may from seizure therapy, or whatever. On top of that, I'm that gay kid in the family so I get teased a little here and there. My situation isn't a lot like yours, but I understand having a stressful situation between you and your family.

If I were you, I'd try and take a break from them some how. whether it's in the form of a vacation, or even moving, who knows. If they really want to be like that to you, perhaps it's just better off to leave them. I know that would be very hard to do, and probably not the best advice, honestly. But perhaps even just distancing yourself from them for a little while will help change things. When I was little, I accidentally got child family services called to my stepmom. She was furious. I was kicked out of the house for two months. When I was finally allowed to return to the house, I just stayed quiet. Didn't talk to her unless spoken to, not really showing any affection to her, just distancing myself the best I could while living in the same house. Eventually, things got better. It was only recently that it seems things have gotten back to normal again. Things take time, so just have patience. Perhaps, just maybe, they'll finally change and treat you better.

Well, I hope things get better for you! Good luck!"
offmychest,fe8w2pm,t3_eo5vbd,1578931657.0,"Hm, before I give my advice, I had a situation like that. except I was the person who was being fell for. She confessed, and I said we could try it out. We probably could have made it work, but she was clingy. like, yandere style clingy. she literally tried to hurt anyone who did as much as talk to me. On top of that, the more I met her, the more I realized how strange she was as a person.

I'm not saying this would happen to you. It's just my experience. She was crazy. Just wait until you feel the time is right, and let her know. if she really was a friend, she would still be a friend  even if she didn't like you back after you confessed. If everything goes well and she shares feelings, though, just try not to act too clingy or anything of the sort. Just.. be yourself. that's all I can really advise. I hope things go well for you!"
offmychest,fe8ujua,t3_eo5ty4,1578931105.0,"I would feel the same way. Either outcome is a possibility, though if you guys have already gone on a couple dates and she seems to have enjoyed it, then I'm pretty certain she just deleted the profile or something. No matter the outcome, good luck! :)"
offmychest,fe8u5yv,t3_eo5tzs,1578930924.0,"That sucks, man. I can' t relate, as I'm barely in high school, though I can imagine it's pretty rough. If you hate college, you hate college. It's not really one of those things you can easily change. Just try to keep in mind that all this Hell will be worth it in the end when you finally get that job you want.

I hope things get better for you soon. :)"
