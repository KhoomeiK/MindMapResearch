cars,ff6mql4,t1_ff6lutn,1579630503.0,just asking for your personal opinion here. i chose a new CR-V over a CX-5 last January. did i make the right call?
LifeProTips,ff5q57i,t1_ff52inr,1579605654.0,what juicer do you have? just curious. would love to make my own orange juice.
sousvide,ff3bgq3,t1_ff37gy5,1579537902.0,"they literally do the same thing. the only difference is air fryers may have a smaller space.

sousvide,ff2wons,t1_ff1lqui,1579526968.0,an air fryer is just a convection oven.
todayilearned,ferpsh2,t1_feowmmz,1579356973.0,isn’t that also something someone who didn’t go thru that would do?
nba,fel1p10,t1_feizs9t,1579212143.0,is this actually true tho? last year they gave the Raptors the toughest time out of anybody. if they win that series they’re probably in the finals and who knows?
nba,fekorpu,t1_feklaw9,1579204481.0,you hate to see it
nba,fekoqd8,t1_fekjlgi,1579204459.0,yeah he would be fairly useless on the Sixers
nba,fdpi4ln,t1_fdp9kgp,1578629245.0,also tbh joel not being in there opens up a lot for him. the paint is more clogged with joel. simmons operates well down there
hiphopheads,fdhcfru,t1_fdga0o5,1578419889.0,"i think because his hype has faded, and yes because it’s hard to live up to that hype with just good music, that’s the reason he’s doing something like this. pretty gimmicky IMO"
hiphopheads,fdgzcmt,t1_fdfp52h,1578411971.0,damn i have never heard it or even OF it.
AskReddit,fddjrq0,t1_fddincq,1578315033.0,they support a fraud university to own the libs so why not a pyramid scheme?
Braves,fd37b51,t1_fd33u9c,1578155387.0,Arenado’s contract is ridiculous. the Rockies would need to kick in at least $10M per year for as long as he’s a Brave to get a big prospect package back. as it stands he isn’t worth that much in terms of prospects.
DunderMifflin,fcy8cr2,t1_fcwtgy3,1578076222.0,"watched this last weekend for like the 10th time and only now noticed he’s in that movie. so weird. i’ve seen it so many times, after i had watched the office plenty and never picked up on it."
nba,fcy7w4u,t1_fcy5pt8,1578076010.0,"i’m sure he beats him 1-on-1. but that’s not what Ingram said. 

and yeah, relating extensions to beating them in that scenario is useless anyways lol"
nba,fcy7gyw,t1_fcy0qfk,1578075892.0,"dancing on that losing team? eh ok lol


edit: ok guys i’m sorry, i wasn’t here for that copy pasta moment it won’t happen again"
nba,fcxwod2,t1_fcxvfy6,1578071565.0,"i've played it. in my experience, being bigger, faster, and stronger than someone means something."
nba,fcxwhnn,t1_fcxsbnd,1578071454.0,lol that's a terrible justification....
nba,fcxwc0u,t1_fcxtrb2,1578071392.0,"he's also bigger, faster, and stronger. he'd be able to get to the hoop."
nba,fcxw32e,t1_fcxv3pj,1578071330.0,spoiler: he's not
personalfinance,fcutkm1,t1_fcuqlhm,1577988221.0,"i agree. i was just disagreeing with that person saying suburbs in any state have the same problems listed as suburbs in the south. i also grew up in NJ/philly and the suburbs around philly don’t have those problems at all, and many of them feel like legit city neighborhoods but still more town-y, if that makes sense."
personalfinance,fcu3yv0,t1_fctyh0p,1577971944.0,"not quite but yes there is more land and therefore more rural areas without much around. NJ is the most densely populated state and surrounded by big cities. therefore, not any state’s suburbs are as rural as the south’s. that’s the entire point lol. even rural areas in rural PA are not like they are in the south."
personalfinance,fctxynh,t1_fcsxy3m,1577965135.0,"that’s not true. suburbs in NJ can often be extensions of the city itself. even the more rural parts are nothing like the rural south.

how on earth does a literal fact get downvoted??"
Delaware,fcr72m6,t1_fcr4wd8,1577897717.0,"lol. miss me with that disingenuous garbage. we know a lot about pence. read some of the things he enacted/supported in indiana. you don’t have to be caught using a slur to be a homophobe. 

why is it that every person who freely uses that type of language is a republican tho? so weird!"
Delaware,fcr40e0,t1_fcr3nc6,1577896452.0,i’ll point you to the vice president you presumably voted for. not actively thinking this way but being complicit by supporting these types of people isn’t really that different.
Delaware,fcqrtsw,t3_eiiuuw,1577891219.0,this is not surprising from anyone associated with the GOP at this point. par for the course.
hiphopheads,fcqgx70,t1_fcpps6v,1577885789.0,holy fuck her thoughts on hitler and germany are painfully stupid. wow.
EarthPorn,fcqgbgy,t1_fcqb2nb,1577885467.0,"did Zion two years ago in January. hardly anybody there and the temp was around 45F the entire time. it was perfect, even for The Narrows."
AskReddit,fcnyblo,t1_fcmtp99,1577820803.0,healthcare being strictly for-profit is such a tremendously terrible idea it’s hard to believe it exists.
AskReddit,fcny8ue,t1_fcmwyhj,1577820763.0,cuz you’ll die too soon?
AskReddit,fcnpvet,t1_fcnpe2q,1577816189.0,if they can spare an hour a week they can likely prep lunches and/or dinners for the entire week. *shrugs*
AskReddit,fcnntd5,t1_fcmsjpu,1577815014.0,"i’ll tell you one of my favorite lunch/dinners that’s just rice, veggies, and egg. i think i could feed 2 on it for less than $40 a week. 

1). make rice. a serving size is a 1/4 cup. i’ll usually make about 2 cups, or 8 servings. i also have an instant pot, which is basically my large, glorified rice maker. but i digress. 

2). chop onion. sauté in pan with canola oil. if i’m doing this large of a batch, i’ll do maybe 2 whole yellow onions. 

3). when onion is translucent, add a little more oil and mixed frozen veggies. we always do corn, peas, and carrots. cook, stirring often, until heated thru. 

4). add rice to pan. move everything to the sides and throw in some egg. for smaller batches i do 1 egg per serving, for a big batch like this i’ll do 4-6 eggs total. 

5). stir the egg around the center, scrambling it. 

6). dump in soy sauce. and stir around until mixed in. 

i top with sriracha after it’s finished. i can get the ingredients for that large of a batch for probably $20 tops, total."
AskReddit,fcnmioy,t1_fcn8dlu,1577814318.0,"well sous vide is the secret here but good luck getting people who aren’t into cooking to decide to do that. 

my fiancée and i do top sirloin all the time sous vide. it’s a bit more than $5/lb but we can get 5 enormous steaks, easily enough for 10 servings of the meat portion of our meal, for like $24. and it comes out tasting great."
AskReddit,fcnlw0h,t1_fcn7xdy,1577813992.0,i don’t even bother re-heating steak. eating it cold is way better imo
AskReddit,fcnjydu,t1_fcnjml3,1577813089.0,"true, for some. perhaps i take for granted that i’m a fairly good/efficient cook and can operate like a machine in the kitchen. but part of that is doing it all the time, which obviously made me a lot better at it."
AskReddit,fcnjhlv,t1_fcmrbkj,1577812868.0,"wrong. probably my favorite/lunch dinner takes 15 minutes to prep and make, and i can make a boatload of it at once in the same amount of time. it’s healthy and delicious."
AskReddit,fcnjcp5,t1_fcmwbz6,1577812805.0,love how much you got downvoted by the lazy brigade claiming they have no time to ever cook.
AskReddit,fcnj6pp,t1_fcn5taa,1577812725.0,"they’re lazy. that’s what they’re doing wrong. they’re using “no time!” to hide behind, but for the vast majority of people that’s bs."
AskReddit,fcni73e,t1_fcnhw6o,1577812218.0,why would it be shitty? they have salad kits that have all the same stuff you get in a salad from say saladworks or panera. you can buy the rotisserie chicken and shred it up or often pre-made chicken breast. or take 10 minutes to cook up a few pieces of chicken. and the chicken will probably be better anyway.
AskReddit,fcnhz2v,t1_fcmr29s,1577812093.0,"how crazy is your schedule that you can’t take an hour or two per week and meal prep a bunch of stuff..? that sounds awful. you have zero downtime, ever?"
AskReddit,fcnhh5q,t1_fcn1gd1,1577811802.0,i mean you’re wrong but ok
AskReddit,fcnh1v4,t1_fcn65db,1577811547.0,"you can pick up bagged salad and pre-made chicken breast for probably half the price of a salad out. 

most people don’t cook because they’re lazy. not because they don’t have the time."
AskReddit,fcnaku6,t1_fcn5kef,1577807452.0,"blue apron is also oftentimes more complex meals than what i pretty much ever cook and i cook allllllll the time, every single day."
AskReddit,fcn7bu0,t1_fcn5pc0,1577805155.0,...what about 2 people? it doesn’t take my fiancée and i long at all to cook dinner each night and even prep lunches for the week as well. throwing two chicken breasts in a pan doesn’t take that much more tune than 1. roasting broccoli for 2 doesn’t take much longer either.
AskReddit,fcinnvm,t1_fcin1s3,1577665639.0,"i mean a shit ton of people smoke weed all the time for decades and aren’t useless pieces of shit who can’t hold down a job and be productive. i don’t think it’s possible to scientifically prove it *doesn’t* make every person who smokes often a useless piece of shit but like it factually doesn’t in the history of the world, so claiming that is absurd."
AskReddit,fcimx2e,t1_fcilfm9,1577665245.0,"i’ve taken edibles plenty, black market and dispensary. i usually just stick with 10mg and they don’t get me crazy high or anything, just really chilled out"
AskReddit,fcim5oe,t1_fcilbsv,1577664881.0,in which post did i say that? it seems you are not able to read adequately :/
AskReddit,fcikv7x,t1_fcikm88,1577664250.0,"damn, thanks dog. i’m going to try it."
AskReddit,fcikna9,t1_fcijpn0,1577664148.0,"lmao, oh, is that what i said? please quote where i said that. 

if you’re able to adequately read, i said that MAY have been his/her experience. claiming it’s universally only ok every once in a while is utter horseshit. one person’s supposed experience does not make it a universal fact."
todayilearned,fcijnc9,t1_fciirqv,1577663663.0,"yep, that’s exactly what i felt the root of the disagreement was."
AskReddit,fciizen,t1_fciippe,1577663336.0,"i didn’t make a claim other than correlation doesn’t equal causation, which is a fact. many people can smoke weed often and be completely fine."
AskReddit,fciis6r,t1_fcigifz,1577663242.0,i want to make my own so bad. where do you suggest i start?
AskReddit,fcii8m1,t1_fci6n5r,1577662978.0,"your ex is just a shit person, with or without weed."
AskReddit,fcihjfa,t1_fcifjo0,1577662649.0,"...for you, *maybe*. correlation does not equal causation especially in something concluded in a completely unscientific manner

lol, gotta love that the objectively incorrect people are throwing their ignorance around on reddit by downvoting, but for the record, it still doesn’t make you correct."
todayilearned,fci1k26,t1_fchnj5w,1577656638.0,two examples in the history of time? i mean i’ll go ahead and say it’s a fact the coasts have in general been the most desirable places to live and very clearly is preferred in America considering demand/population density. somehow that’s controversial on reddit lol
todayilearned,fchl6lt,t1_fche9zs,1577651511.0,i mean there is a reason people throughout time have preferred to live on coasts
todayilearned,fchkx35,t1_fche7uc,1577651428.0,username sort of checks out
AskReddit,fc5wfcf,t1_fc5cy57,1577467332.0,"tbh i find this to be an issue with avid gym-goers as much as anyone else. i'll see a jacked dude who clearly lives there not bother to put them back. it's almost like an entitlement thing, like he doesn't feel he has to."
nba,fc3a3a6,t1_fc21fm2,1577385131.0,Simmons’ ceiling is MUCH higher which is why they aren’t comparable talents...
nba,fc39xi9,t1_fc379e0,1577385019.0,na i don’t remember them winning any super bowls in my time as a fan but i’m not sure how that’s relevant to Wentz being overhyped
nba,fc35jj2,t1_fc236jy,1577381966.0,i think it shows that bucks fans don't watch Giannis objectively
nba,fc35aw2,t1_fc19t6v,1577381792.0,i'd say the same for wentz but y'all already bought into that undue hype and gave him one
nba,fc2wyci,t1_fc1fdke,1577376235.0,it's insane how few calls Ben gets. do refs hate him? feel like he gets shafted repeatedly.
AskReddit,fc0xq0v,t1_fbzpjkj,1577302508.0,brussels sprouts smell way more like farts and they’re fucking amazing
AskReddit,fc0e9c3,t1_fbzdojm,1577288455.0,what what?
todayilearned,fbjojq5,t1_fbil4ud,1576937375.0,i bet this teacher hasn’t even ever been in the pizza category
