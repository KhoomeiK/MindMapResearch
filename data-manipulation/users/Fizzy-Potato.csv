Awwducational,fegw9v3,t1_fegu2e3,1579103950.0,I’ve actually been keeping my eye on a dog up for adoption in the SPCA. Her name is Sox and she’s been in the rescue since November 2017 I think. I’m guessing no one wants her as she’s old. Very old. 13 years so she could go at any time. I’d adopt her myself but my family have a spaniel already. He’s old too but apparently Sox is nervous around other dogs so adoption is sorta out of the equation. I’ve managed to persuade my mum to visit her after I finish my exams. I just want to gain her trust so I can at least try to make her lasting moments as nice as possible

Edit: thanks to everyone providing more info on this subject! I’ll admit, previously I just thought people did it because they thought it looked nice.

The last week we were there we went on a safari and holy crap, it was unbelievable. We saw elephants, giraffes, hippos, antelope, a cheetah and a lion pride. It was even the time of year where baby elephants were wandering around and we were lucky enough to see a pair of babies playing together. One of the best life experiences I have so far :)
