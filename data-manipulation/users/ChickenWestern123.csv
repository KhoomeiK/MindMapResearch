So for any company not in the energy or manufacturing sector where they can have a direct influence on what they are directly emitting, where they already track it anyways, to now track their emissions, that they have no control over, is wasted energy and time, and therefore wasted emissions to track something there's no benefit to track.

Well I think you're a bit ignorant for saying that and for dismissing it. It shows based on the fact that you automatically think the electrolysis reaction to produce KOH is going to be more energy intensive than burning hydrocarbons. Furthermore, electrical production/KOH production can be done in areas where the grid is relatively green and low cost, like Quebec.

More energy than the extraction, refinement, transportation, and then combustion of methane?

Potassium hydroxide is produced by electrolysis and you can look up the enthalpy of formation among other properties quite easily. It's nowhere near the energy intensity of methane or whatever hydrocarbon they're using to burn a body.
