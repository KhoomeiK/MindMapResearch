I'm pretty sure that the ""someone"" this young lady interprets as ""needing a throat punch"" is generally going to be ""other women I see as competition"" and not ""people who are threatening me"". Besides, teaching your daughter to throat punch would be predators won't protect her anyway. The example you gave, where a woman is afraid to turn down a man at a bar out-right isn't related to throat-punching. If this T-shirt is trying to be progressive, it way missed the mark and actually kinda sounds victim-blamey in a gender violence context"

In case you can't read the T-shirt and want to (for some reason) but don't want to open the whole image, it says ""I want my daughter to be kind but I also want her to know that she can throat punch someone if she needs to"" which is funny because... uh... because girls are too stupid to know that? Because violence is always the answer? I'm not exactly what the ironic twist is supposed to be here. It's just supposed to be stupid I guess."

I'm glad she enjoys herself but she never explicitly says ""I prefer to get myself off,"" she makes it look like she has no choice because her boyfriend ignores her, but also presents it like a good thing. In my reading of her comment, her boyfriend is extremely selfish and uninterested in her pleasure which is a problem, not a good thing. I'm thinking she left out  some information that would have changed how her comment sounds.

She was the only female, and many of the male employees who made more than her were new. She lost her case because the statute of limitations passed, because you know, it's so easy to know what everyone else is being paid that she should have gotten right on it.

In any case, the non-profit I work for has never been fully staffed, and we are currently short about 7 full time people, in fact as I type this someone asked me if I could work a double this weekend and they will probably ask every weekend until I die, so to call me replaceable would be misleading.
