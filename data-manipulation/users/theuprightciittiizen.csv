todayilearned,feq3fll,t1_fepyz1a,1579337089.0,"I think in this case the username *doesn’t* check out. I know those words may be hard to read, but sometimes Reddit just throws you a curveball and if you don’t at least swing then what’re you doing?

LOL nah idfk I just woke up to pee and now I’m smoking a cigarette I’m not in any place to try and fill the “wise uncle” role. Is that even a thing? I don’t think so. So naturally, it fits. Thumbs up emoji (ya I know you can post emojis BUT I CHOSE NOT TO FIGHT ME)"

doughboys,fc0kdhn,t3_eexog8,1577292866.0,"I honestly think this  could sell well  even without any context whatsoever. I see the words “Oven Fries™️” and I just inherently agree. 

I believe it could even be a bold fashion statement. Like, fuck you- Oven Fries™️. Oh hey and fuck you too... Oven Fries™️. There’s nothing to get. And yet you get it. Therein lies the beauty itself.

Oven Fries™️is not just a phase. Oven Fries™️are something deeper (and in some cases crispier) than they appear on the surface. Hey Oven Fries™️? Love ya, and thanks for all the good times"
AskReddit,fbt1nr7,t1_fbt0t3n,1577065936.0,I appreciate you.
