history,ffgk3e9,t1_ffevuqv,1579908055.0,"> Sweden never managed to get rid of serfdom in their Baltic dominions, which kept a large population there in poverty

Wrong. Swedish Estonia kept serfdom because they submitted to Sweden before the rest of Livonia and had a separate treaty with Sweden. It also didn't have the legal uniformity policy applied. But serfdom was abolished in the rest of Livonia.

It was reinstituted when Livonia was lost to Russia a century later."
history,ffgjte8,t1_ffezk8b,1579907873.0,"> They kept their own laws and customs and the same Baltic-German nobility that'd been ruling the place was kept in place

Wrong. Swedish Estonia (north of modern day Estonia) kept their own laws because they submitted to Sweden before and there was a separate treaty with them. The rest of Swedish Livonia had the same legal system implemented as Sweden proper after the Swedish conquest."
history,ffgjksp,t3_eszem0,1579907716.0,"I mean I cannot tell personally how it was, considering it was four centuries ago. But in Latvia we definitely still remember (so to speak) it fondly.

The extreme poverty statement is a bit suspect since in those times anyone anywhere who's not aristocracy lived in abject poverty, and even the royalty had a pretty shit living circumstance, compared to modern day. Realistically, before the Swedes there was the German ruling class, and the natives were either serfs or urban population.

Anyway, returning to the Swedish Empire - yes, the Swedish conquest drastically improved life here. Swedes abolished serfdom, made education available to all, instituted a proper legal system with the same laws for everyone, and the same laws as in Sweden proper, and there was a century of peace and prosperity. There still was the German ruling class but their rights were severely curtailed. And then there came the Russians and, as they say about all of Russian history ""and then it got worse"" - they undid everything, serfdom was reinstituted, and everything went back to shit."

Where I live maybe one in five or ten sushi places get it right and the rest get away with it because the general public just doesn't care. They just need their multicolor rainbow with cream cheese, roe, and everything under the sun stuffed into it because it looks good before you drown it in soy.

And anyway, you cannot say you ""don't like French wines"" but you do like some other country's wine. Maybe Argentinean wine selection really is that narrow but in many others it is much more diverse.  Some Bordeaux wines will be more similar to Argentinean Malbec than to Burgundy, and Burgundy will be more similar to New Zealand than Jura. Also, shit wines are everywhere and good wines can be found everywhere.

I personally don't like French wines because by the time they get here, they're overpriced crap. Literally, the same wine that's sold in a French supermarket for 3-5€ will cost closer to 15-20€ here, and the really good French wines will cost exorbitantly (I know it's pretty much the same past a certain point, and it's diminishing returns, I just don't want to pay 50€ for a 20€ wine.)"
