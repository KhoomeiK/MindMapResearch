shittymoviedetails,ffwds78,t1_ffwdq52,1580297026.0,The greater goop.

StudentNurse,ffrva5q,t1_ffqyxgl,1580166634.0,I’ve tried quizlet but for me it doesn’t work as well as writing it out and seeing it in my own handwriting. I definitely get the appeal though.
datingoverthirty,ffqfnur,t3_eudf04,1580133198.0,"Was 19 when I met this waitress. Got engaged a year & 1/2 later. We broke up for a day. She banged some dude and we got back together the next day. She wouldn't stop texting him. I was very forgiving. She broke up with me.

Fast forward a decade. Look her up. Unmarried, a kid, a laundry list of shitbag exes, and she's still a waitress. It's funny because she was trying to pressure me into moving out of mom and dad's, despite my insistence that we could save money just living at home for a couple years and get a house. 

Meanwhile I moved to LA, became a TV producer, had some fun, quit, and now I'm in nursing school."
StudentNurse,ffp21tm,t1_ffp02h0,1580084598.0,Thanks!!
StudentNurse,ffp1xz7,t1_ffo6gzn,1580084538.0,Wasn’t exactly focusing on penmanship considering I had 240 terms and abbreviations to write. But I’m glad you feel better.

unpopularopinion,fflreuv,t3_etw9ii,1580043206.0,I liked your point about people from poor countries coming to “wow” us. It’s pretty exploitative.
Tinder,fflpj50,t3_etz2o5,1580042496.0,I can pass off as early 20s. I’d expect to get paid for my time though.

politics,ffe7nfz,t1_ffe71dl,1579838902.0,"Trump is a businessman. You honestly think he’d refuse someone’s money just because of their skin color? Please. He was a CEO. His name was attached as a legal formality. If a manager at an Amazon warehouse refused to hire Asians, and someone sued, Jeff Bezos would be a defendant in addition to Amazon."

politics,ffe5zw6,t1_ffe3avv,1579837607.0,"Debatable. There isn’t really any definitive, outright proof. I didn’t vote for the man, but I’m not going to label someone a racist just because a news outlet interpreted something that way and used a sensationalist headline."

quityourbullshit,ff7olko,t1_ff7j2ke,1579654559.0,Bullshitting people with a fake story isn’t something praise worthy. It’s not hard...it just takes a lack of moral values.

quityourbullshit,ff7o9iq,t1_ff7iyj6,1579654322.0,Well for starters... OP is a proven douche because real heroes don’t post on Reddit for Internet points. Consider that Evidence A.
quityourbullshit,ff7nqcj,t1_ff7l6g2,1579653946.0,"Proof: OP is a douche
Non proof: OP is a liar"
quityourbullshit,ff7iw6a,t1_ff7imtz,1579650601.0,"This is true. Hence the “no proof” tag. Going with my gut on this one. Primarily due to the fact that it takes a special kind of douche to post about their own hero moment for internet points, and all we have to go on is a blurry video."
HumansBeingBros,ff7ioo1,t1_feqbx6g,1579650462.0,Where’s the proof bruh?
quityourbullshit,ff7ikvh,t1_ff7iice,1579650391.0,I asked him about it. He evaded the question.
