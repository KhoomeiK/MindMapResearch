There's lots of ways to make it work depending on the circumstances and the counter-parties and the regulatory and tax framework. That's why Switzerland is popular.

But anyway, here's one bog standard way:

1. You start with your dirty money, 10 million USD in cash.
2. You look out for an auction, or even better, an art dealer who can arrange a private sale, and look for something in the $10 million range to buy.
3. You spend your $10 million on one or more Andy Warhols, or whatever.
4. You  show those Warhols  to your bank, get a loan for $9,000,000 dollars using  the paintings as collateral.
5. You now have a clean $9,000,000 loaned from the bank. Start all over again.

Money laundering through art sales is far, far, far easier, far more low profile, not risky at all, fast as it can be, and (Shock!!!) Switzerland has a whole logistical infrastructure to facilitate it. And when they weren't buying dodgy banks in even more dodgy countries, that's what these guys did when they were laundering the money. Joe Low bought and sold $100 million paintings and stored them in Switzerland."
