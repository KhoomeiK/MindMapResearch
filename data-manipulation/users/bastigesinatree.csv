3.  Mom isn't a believer at all.

If neither parent believes in infant baptism , it's literally water on his forehead.  The baptismal certificate is a piece of paper. 

The child is too young to be indoctrinated. He'll never know if not told.

The grandparents are comforted knowing that if, God forbid, anything happens to this dearly loved child, he will go to Heaven.

Granted, the grandparents have gone about this all wrong. They should have discussed this with the parents and explained their fears and asked them to agree.
