PublicFreakout,ffmeoch,t1_ffm7q6z,1580053475.0,"Finally found one. A triggered lib that has to interject Trump in every comment. You do know there were racist people before Trump and guess what? There are still less racist people now than before Trump. Joe Biden voted for segregation, yet he isn’t a racist.

This post is not even politically motivated, but you had to make it political because you’re so triggered and your life revolves around hating Trump. Go outside and breathe some fresh air and hang out with other human beings."

worldnews,ffitdlx,t1_ffilyyd,1579982238.0,"Unfortunately I can’t listen to the diarrhea that comes out of MSNBC. Nothing says gullible like when they repeat the same exact phrases over and over again. It’s kind of like they are reading a script, but yeah, classy journalism /s.

Democrats are poor, so enjoy being poor."
worldnews,ffij866,t1_ffihmtw,1579975167.0,"LOL “new job”

Why do you feel bad about the people who rent from me? 

It’s pretty simple, I facilitate a place for them to live in and they pay for it. I can’t be all Bernie Sanders and give them a free place to live. They are nice and cozy apartments. I also provide jobs for people who ultimately are too dumb for normal jobs. But yeah, I am the bad guy. 

I am confused about being triggered. Your very first post is the definition of being triggered. Oh your one of those redditors uh? I am also a white supremacist, nazi, bootlicker, snowflake, racist, and homophobic. I might of missed some since I can’t keep up with the name calling the left loves so much."

Stocks options lol. Yeah I have a 401k and a Roth IRA...those are peanuts...you want to play with the big boys? I own 4 commercial buildings, 2 apartment buildings, 2 cell phone towers on my properties, and own 4 rentals. One is on a lake, it’s fucking gorgeous man."
worldnews,ffiglew,t1_ffidbnu,1579973378.0,"How can you compare the corruption of democrats and republicans when the media is only concerned with the republicans being corrupt. How many times have I read an article about a corrupt politician only to have to google whether he was democrat or republican because the article failed to mention it. Why? Because he was a democrat. If it’s a republican, it’s the first sentence in the article. This happens a lot and has shaped my views on how bias the media can be. Everyone talks shit on Fox News (rightfully so) but there are 100 Fox News on the left side. The fact that in 2020, then newspapers are allowed to lean a certain way should be what scares us the most. I am definitely looking at you Washington Post. This whole Trump thing by the democrats is a smokescreen which allows them to continue to be corrupt as well.

What you list about Biden proves how influenced by the media you are. He is by no fucking means intelligent. 

Example;

He’s a creepy old man who voted for segregation. Funny how people forget that. Trump dodged the draft but Biden isn’t a racist. He did absolutely shit while Vice President and him being in politics for 40 years is the problem, not the solution. He will 100% win the Democratic Party because the DNC has already picked him. Just like Bernie got railroaded by Hillary in 2016. We remember Donna Brazile? Yeah the democrats are not corrupt /s. 

He also is def 100% pedophile that hasn’t been caught yet. No one touches little kids like that.

Here is a start to the good things he’s done and it’s by a source you can’t complain about:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/12/26/best-things-trump-has-done/%3foutputType=amp

He’s done things to help the opioids problem in this country.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/09/04/trump-administration-announces-1-8-billion-funding-states-combating-opioid.html%3famp

Again, I am not a fan of the man, I just think it’s funny how the left attacks him nonstop. Some things are worth attacking him over, sure, but some are just plain ridiculous."

/politics = Fox News"
worldnews,ffibebj,t1_ffhaiub,1579969847.0,"Are you even an American citizen? In the one post you referred to the guy as “mate”. Are you British American? I love when people from Europe want to chime in our politics like they don’t have their own problems. That’s the only reason I ask. 

And your being made a fool to believe that every democrat is a saint and has done nothing wrong. Guess what? Even democrats are pedophiles. Even democrats break the law (or in your case, like you say it, shit on the constitution). you think Nancy Pelosi is squeaky clean? Look it up. She’s done some shady shit as well. The democrats are closer whores, going around like their shit don’t stink while calling everyone else out for the same shit they do. 

The fact that “they” want Biden to win, just shows how corrupt they are. Have you listened to him talk, he’s pretty much on par with the way Trump talks. He’s a democrat Trump. 

I don’t watch Fox News. I don’t watch any of those programs, I get my news from my phone and filter out the garage like VICE, and buzzfeed and Business Insider, etc... The Enquirer has more credibility than those put together jk. 

And I love when people think it’s the end of the world because of TRUMP. Like oh my god, he’s done so much damage. He’s actually done some good stuff, but no one cares cause they hate him so much. I am not gonna take my time to list it. I also don’t agree with everything he’s doing, even though the left thinks every conservative agrees with him 100%. I am all for cleaning up the environment and cleaner air and shit, so I don’t agree with him rolling back those laws. I do agree with the China trade, we have to get China out of America (no thanks to Obama). Funny I was watching the movie The Campaign with will Ferrell and Zack garifalakis and the part about China taking over a town was actually scary because it’s happening. And guess what, that movie was made in 2012 way before Trump."
worldnews,ffh95dy,t1_ffgsy5x,1579926704.0,"Not a Trump fan. I just don’t sit here and regurgitate everything one side says. I actually like to listen to both sides before I get my panties in a bunch. I also believe that most if not all politicians are dirty in some way, but the left has a huge hard-on for Trump. Like Obama never did any shady shit. 

Lobbying is pretty much to blame for everything, but we sit here and bicker about left/right, Democrats/Republicans, while they get paid! The media makes their money off us bickering. 

Maybe that’s why Trump got elected in the first place. Because politicians BEFORE Trump were the real problem and people noticed, but the media changed that real quick."
