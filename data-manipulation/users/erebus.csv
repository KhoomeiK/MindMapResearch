witchcraft,ff4to1p,t1_ff39pnv,1579572184.0,"Okay, so I don't have time to write out everything I want to, but I'll point you in the right direction. Around the time of the renaissance, a lot of ancient classical texts became available to scholars - mostly those affiliated with the church. The author of some of these was a purported Egyptian magician and philosopher called Hermes Trismegistus. The study of his works and derivations thereof is called hermeticism. While not technically witchcraft in the modern sense, it still encompasses magic, ritual, astrology, alchemy, and other occult subjects.

There are two books you should read if you want to practice monotheistic/Abrahamic magic. The first is The Kybalion. It's the cornerstone of hermetic philosophy, and it's about 50 pages long and a pretty easy read. The second is ""Modern Magick: Twelve Lessons in the High Magickal Arts"" by Donald Michael Kraig. It's sort of a textbook in magic rooted in Judeo-Christian mysticism. I'll message you about it."

She explores how, before pen and paper, people had to memorize vast amounts of information by ""encoding"" it into places, images, and things. It's not hard to start recording emotional/spiritual states that way.

For example, during one particular meditation, I became aware of the various physical processes going on in my body - from breath to neurons firing to my mitochondria releasing energy. I saw my own inner flame, and I was at peace. While in this state, I created a basement to my house with a large boiler. It's warm and has the light of flames licking the walls. Even though it's sparse - everything is raw, living rock - it's comfortable and peaceful and *mine*. Now, whenever I want to return to that state, I don't have to go through a lengthy meditation session - I just go into my basement and feel the space. I have about a dozen states like this so far, including a reverence for my ancestors (portrait gallery) and receptivity to my patron gods (my garden)."

In order to become proficient, you have to do some ""shadow work"" and confront the darkest parts of yourself openly and honestly. It's painful, but you will become much more proficient in your work this way. To me, your dreams sound like your subconscious mind or astral spirit - what Jung would call the ""shadow self"" - trying to manifest. Embrace it, confront it, and work with it. It will be painful, but you will be much better off for it - both as a witch and as a person."
