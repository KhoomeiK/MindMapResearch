WhiteWolfRPG,ff5nief,t3_erkvy9,1579601805.0,"In addition to the popular suggestions, I'd say info dump is not the best tool really. I'm usually quite attentive during games, but one of my GM loved telling long, protracted stories.

WhiteWolfRPG,ff41wg9,t3_erg01y,1579553748.0,"Honestly, he probably gets away with it.

There's nothing specifically that prohibits garou grom killing other garou per se. It's an unwanted result because there are only so many Garou and I believe that Nation reerves capital punishment to the the most severe cases because of that (it's better to exile, criplle or whatever Garou than to kill him because when he's gone, he's gone), but if things come to that, well then that's how it goes.

But there are some clauses where he can get punished. The most obvious one is Accept Honorable Surrender litany. If you submut and he goes on to kill you, he well be reprimanded. 

But the question is whether you actually need to challenge him at all. The same Litany states that Alpha must be obeued during the times of war (like, on a mission). If you Ahroun disobeyes your orders during 'wartime', he can and will be punished for that. If he constantly cripples your pack, he can be brought to order under some creative use of 'Don't do anything to violate caern' rule as if you pack is protecting  sept, fucking you up is directly mesing with your ability to protect the caern.

Usully the pack is expected to carry out internal punishemnets themselves, but it's not unheard of to ask elders for help to rule someone in. After all, coming to your sept's master of challenge or truthcatcher and saying something along the lines of 'hey, elder-person, our pack Ahroun is a blood monster this close to murdering us, rending the Veil and jumping the Spiral, can you please step in for a sec?' is totally viable move"

If seriously, know your bases. Have a good idea of where your story is going, who are major players and what you want to achieve. This is helpful when you have ad-lib a scene or incorporate an unexpected player decision (though usually players make exactly the decisions you expect them to, at least that's my experience).

You don't have to know all the rules by heart, but it helps. What you most certainly need to do is to know where to look specific rule that may come up. If you don't remember something, don't be afraid to flip pages and check. That said, don't be afraid to make a ruling based on your assumption. Saying something 'we're doing it this way now and can argue the rules after the game' is valid and sometimes vital strategy. There is nothing worse than halting a game to argue some rule wording with one player while everyone else think 'why am I wasting my time here?'

Be mindful of the mood. If someone feels left out, give that player bit of spotlight. If someone is stealing the show, check if everyone is ok with that.  Don't be afraid to take someone down a peg if they threaten the general mood of the party.

And most important, have fun yourself. You're not doing paid work (unless you do) and don't serve the players. Actually you're just another player, you just happen to have a different set of responsibilities from the others. Doesn't mean you are prohibited from enjoying the game.

Oh and the last one. Give them hell. A victory you have to really fight for is so much better than the victory that just fell into your lap"
rpg,fenop6r,t3_eq081r,1579288690.0,"That really depends on the game.

Some campaigns don't need grand finale, others pretty much scream something special. One thing that I strive to achieve is that the finale should be a statement. It should cut loose ends (unless there will be a sequel, then the end should create a path to it) and provide enough closure. Beyond that it really depends on the game. Sometimes it's as plain as the final fight. Sometimes characters die. Sometimes whoel party dies. Sometimes you plan a grand attle, but instead a tragedy happens that makes the battle moot and characters are left to deal with the fallout of said tragedy"
