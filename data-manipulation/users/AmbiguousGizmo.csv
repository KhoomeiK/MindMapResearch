todayilearned,fehotai,t1_fehlyt1,1579120882.0,"I manage the Cat Pawsitive program at the shelter I work at. ""Semester"" is referring to the 12 weeks that staff members and volunteers are supported and trained by behaviorists while they are implementing this program into the shelter. After the 12 weeks, shelters are free to continue the program or not."
todayilearned,feho3zu,t1_fehn6yy,1579120477.0,"This is a great question. I'll start off by saying that ""high five"" is not the only behavior that is learned in this program. It's simply the ""coolest"" one that gets the most attention. There are also two different versions of Cat Pawsitive. There is Cat Pawsitive (CP) and Cat Pawsitive Pro (CPP). I've lead both programs within my shelter and can say there are big differences between the two. 

CP is working with the cats that are already more adoptable to begin with. This helps shelter employees and volunteers learn the basics of clicker training with cats that are easier to train.

CPP is working with harder to adopt cats. These cats can be more aggressive, shy, seniors (they have a harder time finding homes), long-staying residents, etc. My shelter now participates in CPP and we focus on those cats a lot more, though sometimes we add more adoptable cats to the program simply because they have too much energy and this is a good outlet for them. A lot of the cats we train are just too shy and get overlooked. This program helps to build their confidence and come out of their shell. We start with teaching simple behaviors like eye contact, or maybe even approaching you. Anything that we would consider positive improvement for that cat can be rewarded.

It's really cool to get to high-five, but honestly any form of positive reinforcement is what makes a difference for these cats. I hope that makes sense and answers your questions!"
