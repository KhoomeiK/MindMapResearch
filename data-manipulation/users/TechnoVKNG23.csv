Atlanta,ffiyn3q,t1_fficzc4,1579985948.0,"When I left in 2010 I was renting a 2 BR loft in Sandy Springs for about $800/mo. When I came back in 2015 that same apartment was renting for almost $1500/mo. My mom had moved out of a place in Alpharetta around the same time, paying about $650ish for a nice 1BR for her and her cat, and she bought a house. That same 1BR in 2015 was renting for over $1300/mo. It was absolutely nuts.

The public transit thing really gets me to. When I first came back I found a ""reasonable"" place off Holcomb Bridge road that was only about 9 miles from my office...and that drive still took 30+ minutes. They eventually caught on to the surging rent market and I wound up having to move out to Forsyth County. Love being so close to hiking and the mountains since that's one of my things, but 28 miles on GA 400 is the definition of brutality every day, lol"

DaveRamsey,ffiyddx,t3_etuh57,1579985752.0,"One of the few things about him that drives me a little nuts, especially having worked in multifamily housing for years. He has no clue about rent markets and it just makes me laugh a bit when he tells people they can easily find a $500/mo. apartment in San Francisco or any other big city. ""Sure there are!"" is what he always says when a caller says there is nowhere reasonable to rent. He really has no idea how out of control rents have become, even in lower cost of living cities. I remember when he was talking to a lady in Atlanta(where I live) and was trying to tell her she could easily find a cheaper apartment close to the city when her current place was raising her rent and it just made me chuckle because even 30-35 miles outside of the city, you are looking at minimum $1100+ for a small 1BR apartment and he was telling her she could easily find somewhere close to the city for under $1000. 

He knows Nashville and that's about it, his info/data on outside markets is hilariously out of touch. A few weeks ago he was telling a caller in Toledo, Ohio that it was a high income area and he shouldn't be struggling to find a job making $60,000 because that was the average income and in reality the average household income in Toledo is about 35k. His overall advice is great, but he's out of touch on how the cost of living and income numbers have changed across America."

masseffect,ffhkuu1,t1_ffhbmqc,1579939987.0,"I think it's because ME1 is mostly a military mission and that atmosphere is present throughout the game on board the ship. ME2 was Shepard's show and a much more ""lax"" environment on the ship. ME3 felt a bit like this, but I think they did a good job of capturing just how in awe everyone was of the Reapers and how much they were feared. 

IMO if they ever do a remake of the trilogy, I'd love to see them do the Normandy more like the Tempest in Andromeda. While I know that game gets a ton of flack, I generally loved interacting with the crew on the ship, hearing the random trash talk between crew mates, seeing the hilarious message board posts in the crew quarters, etc. It really had atmosphere unlike anything I'd felt in the originals."
Atlanta,ffhkp7z,t3_ete3o6,1579939766.0,"Housing costs are becoming a bit crazy and I honestly wouldn't be surprised if we saw another bubble burst in the next few years. I left the city at the tail end of the crash in 2010 and it was so overbuilt, came back in 2015 and have witnessed the exact same lead up. Cranes everywhere, most cities throwing out the zoning book to accommodate more towers and buildings, cookie cutter neighborhoods popping everywhere, even out in the sticks in Dahlonega. Lived in Dunwoody before and it's almost unrecognizable now they've crammed so many towers, and restaurants, and apartments in, and the entire area is choked by traffic at all hours. See this happening all over the city now. 

Will say I was happy to come back, even though rent/housing has skyrocketed in the 5 years I as away and now I can only afford to live about 30 miles from my office and enjoy almost 3 hours daily in our wonderful traffic. Traffic is probably the worst thing about this city now, it's really hard to enjoy going out or trying to go anywhere when it can literally take hours to go 10 miles depending on what texting idiot rear ended who on the Interstate. Worth dealing with though because to me the people here are pretty cool, everyone seems to get along for the most part regardless of background, the food is excellent(I lived in Pittsburgh before and despite all their ""best city"" articles, there is no culture or good food there), and since I grew up in the mountains, I can have the best of both worlds with the culture of the big city and the quiet beauty of the mountains and waterfalls just an hour or so away. Just wish our public transit options were a little better, got spoiled by the time I spent in Chicago and being able to take the train everywhere, including 20+ miles outside the city."

They've been investing in youtube gaming for a long time and it's never come close to Twitch."
Competitiveoverwatch,ffhemzx,t3_etiy2l,1579932093.0,"My only counter thoughts are that Youtube gaming is pretty awful in general, Youtube treats most of its content creators like crap, all the recent COPPA stuff has led to a lot of uncertainty in general and people leaving the platform, and the viewing experience(besides bitrate/stream quality) in terms of being able to interact with the stream is heads and shoulders worse than what you get on twitch. 

Also if they are going for attracting advertisers, this will make Overwatch League even more PC with more toned down stuff and less drama that the fans supposedly want to see. Youtube's advertisers are notoriously PC and dictate what content is allowed. Youtube has never taken off as a streaming platform and they've made a ton of investments in it to try to catch up to twitch but it's never happened. To me this is more Google wanting to one up Amazon and they probably made a sweeter deal money wise. I won't be surprised if viewership for the league drops by 50% and this feels an awful lot like the Fanatics decision for OWL merch where they went with a crappier product because they got a better financial deal."

Competitiveoverwatch,ffgfhhp,t3_etgcdp,1579905061.0,"Not sure if this is good in the long run, youtube's streaming compared to Twitch is archaic, especially for chat and fans interacting with the stream. Also, does this mean no annual pass, because as far as I know, there isn't any benefit to anything like that on youtube. This feels like a Fanatics move where someone just came up with a bunch of money, not necessarily the best product for fans. Also curious how they are going to do the all access pass views since Youtube doesn't really have that capability from what I've seen. Just overall streaming quality in terms of experience on youtube is a lot worse than Twitch IMO.

KiaSoulClub,ff777qr,t1_ff76uns,1579642486.0,"Probably passenger side. That one is open and easily accessible on the 2014, but the driver's side IIRC you have to take out the fuse box, air filter box, and something else. I watched a video on it and by the time it was shown what you had to do I just took it to the dealer and took the bath on an $80 bulb replacement. I kind of needed to anyway since that light had been flickering and I wanted them to see if the wiring was going bad, but the bulb was just loose and dying."
KiaSoulClub,ff76wd7,t1_ff40im7,1579642305.0,"Yeah my 2014 I think it was around 80k I finally had to get the front ones replaced, I've either been super lucky(got almost 80k out of the original tires) or stuff on Souls lasts forever compared to most other vehicles I've owned."
KiaSoulClub,ff769yo,t3_eq91un,1579641955.0,Can you change your headlamp bulbs? On my 2014 you can't get into the driver's side headlight without removing half the crap in the engine bay. I was pretty upset about having to take the car to the dealer just to get the bulb replaced.
DetroitRedWings,ff75ujb,t1_ff1cea0,1579641719.0,"Except we have absolutely no defense, that's a grade A fail in my book. Holland had been out lunch on shoring up the D since Rafalski and Lids retired."

Doesn't matter who the wings and centers are, we have zero defense and even if our goalies aren't playing well this year, they are on an island all alone with the D in front of them. We don't have a star on D, and we have no depth at the position."

I'm in my 2nd year of BS2 and it's starting to finally sort of dawn on me how much it's helping. The last couple of months I had some emergency vet bills for the cats and also had to get new tires for my car and none of them felt like ""panic mode"" and I was able to just pay cash since it was already budgeted for. The last few months have felt a bit like a slog since I'm into some of my larger balance items, but when I was doing this month's budget I realized that I'm only a couple of months from paying off my car and that was kind of a fun ""YES"" moment."
cats,feo8g9i,t1_fenf6bf,1579296538.0,"They are probably concerned with the commitment. A lot of younger people will adopt pets not realizing the expenses that come along with it. I've had cats my entire life but had been lucky that the 2 I had before my current ones lived long and healthy lives and I took it for granted. The two I have now are both 10+ years old, one developed urinary tract issues that required special diet food that is incredibly expensive and the other has allergies that led to a skin infection last year that required surgery and over $2000 in vet bills, in addition to more specialized diet and an injection once every 3-4 months if her issue flares up. I realized that if anything like that had happened when I was younger and had cats I was taking care of, I'm not sure I could have afforded the vet expenses and at the time it wasn't something I ever worried about. Now obviously I'm a lot smarter and have ""cat care"" budgeted every month regardless if it's used or not, but I know for a lot of young pet owners, stuff like that isn't even on their mind."
