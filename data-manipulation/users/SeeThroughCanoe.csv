bigboye,fexxlqz,t1_fexl20e,1579437999.0,But it's **not** my company. I don't own or operate any rental or tour operations. I **do** own the company that **makes** the canoes and other clear vessels.
bigboye,few1tnm,t1_fevueyv,1579404290.0,the closest place I know of in that area is the Environmental Learning Center in Vero Beach :-)

bigboye,fetronz,t1_fetr5ji,1579379083.0,"In the summer it is just the local dolphins and manatees, during the winter the transient/migratory dolphins and manatees are in the area so there is a lot more activity in the winter overall."
bigboye,fetmnxu,t1_fetcajr,1579376922.0,"There's a number of different places, but this is in St Petersburg, FL. The company that does the tours is See Through Adventures. They specialize in connecting people to manatees and dolphins."
bigboye,fetm6wl,t1_fetb4sz,1579376816.0,"Yeah I have. Been working much more than I would like to lately, but hopefully will be getting out on the water a lot more soon :-)"
bigboye,fet66z8,t1_feszvfb,1579372160.0,"Yep, it was perfect timing. Their breath is bad enough, the farts are like rotten cabbage and sulfur."
SealifeGifs,fekyaea,t1_fekeawb,1579210110.0,"Yes, sort of. 2 canoes and a clear pontoon in the middle to help it handle more weight and also make it unsinkable. It's the final version of a prototype that I'm about to put into production. It is modular and can be used as 2 canoes/kayaks . It will have a variety of motor options electric, propane, and gas. 5 hp is all that is needed to bring it to a plane."
gifs,fejptor,t1_fejorqv,1579182748.0,Scratches you get on the outside of it fill in on the water so you don't notice them. Scratches can also be buffed out with a buffing compound. The canoe you see in most of my videos is about 3 years old and has been used at least twice a week.
gifs,fejpobh,t1_fejn5x6,1579182630.0,It is not available for sale yet. This is the final prototype before I put it into production in about a month.

I  **love** Florida. And it's not like it's the only place I've ever been or lived so I don't have anything to compare it to. I've been to every state in the U.S. except Alaska, and have lived in at least 12 different states. Florida is awesome for outdoor nature lovers."

I'm always doing my own thing anyway. Here's one of our latest projects that we are about to put into production.

Awwducational,fc59d16,t1_fc0fico,1577449705.0,I've never seen an adult human skipping when they could just walk. Not without some other reason.

Awwducational,fc01ov3,t1_fbzgfji,1577273967.0,"That's right, and the blowhole is positioned at the top of the head so all they have to do in order to breathe is surface. So maybe you could explain why you think a dolphin would jump out of the water so it could breathe when all it has to do is come to the surface and lift the top of its head out of the water?"
gifs,fbxij1w,t1_fbxidxy,1577189193.0,They had just spent the previous hour hunting jacks and had a very successful hunt. This was the playtime afterwards. I've never seen a bottlenose dolphin eat a ray.
Awwducational,fbxhthj,t1_fbwt08n,1577188187.0,Are you suggesting they jump out of the water to breathe?
Awwducational,fbk0bgm,t1_fbjpzi4,1576942847.0,"They need to watch each other when they jump in close proximity to each other so they don't collide. It does happen sometimes when they aren't paying attention to each other :-)  

In this video you can't see what is happening below the water when they are jumping, but I do also have a lot of video of them jumping that is taken with a drone and in many of these videos I am able to easily see what is going on beneath the surface. 

One of the most interesting things I've noticed is that it doesn't take much effort for them to jump completely out of the water. They don't need to build up speed or anything. Just 2 hard pumps with the tail and they can leave the water completely. If they want to get big air though they have to get a swimming start."
