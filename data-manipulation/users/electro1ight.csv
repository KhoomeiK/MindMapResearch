boondocking,ffcsxew,t1_ffck04e,1579806605.0,Okay this is exactly the info I was looking for. I think texas classifies sink water as blackwater too. Which has me topsy turvy. But it looks like most of the states don't.
personalfinance,ff85ri0,t1_ff85hge,1579666759.0,Not really... If my payment is $1100 today. It will feel like peanuts 20 years from now... Also the debt owed will relatively also shrink over the life of the mortgage and not just due to what I've paid off...
personalfinance,ff83kgt,t1_ff82p0h,1579665057.0,"Same here. Cost me 4k and dropped pmi... And my total payment is $1100, (down $200)... Anddd I rolled in closing costs so it felt like nothing. Andddd I'll pay ~27k inflation adjusted less over the life of the loan!

I'm a very happy camper."
aww,ff81xmy,t1_ff80y95,1579663851.0,"Well depends. They aren't exposed to the wilds so they aren't experiencing survival of the fittest. In no time their survival (of those captive and used for breeding) will be directly tied to humans. As such, it could be worse in the long run."
askscience,ff5el1t,t1_ff4sprd,1579589544.0,Right?? Thank you. Status LEDs are a red herring if you're after power savings...
todayilearned,ff4xuox,t3_erm5j1,1579575056.0,But we had to know...
sports,ff4wycj,t1_ff46j74,1579574435.0,"Can someone help me understand why it wasn't offsides? I couldn't remember if it was from the kick or from the ball touching the grounds... But regardless, he looked offsides the entire time."
teslamotors,ff4uzw6,t1_ff3rhq2,1579573086.0,Right? Let's not forget the GTR got it's entire front end to disipate the impact. The Tesla got hit from the side... So it it had? A door and some subframe?
pics,fewh2wr,t1_fewgdsd,1579410468.0,"Woah bud. Regardless of how efficient it was, there's no way it was more efficient than a subsonic bird. Further, pollution is pretty proportional to fuel consumption... So that's two strikes."
personalfinance,fewg5ey,t3_eqp9gy,1579410030.0,"I was in the same situation. I was working at NASA my dream place of work since I was 6. I got a job offer to work at a chemical company doing similar work (weird right?) and I took it cause a 46.3% pay raise doesn't come that often. I was so strung out over it that I (a grown ass male) was crying twice at work in my final week worried I had made the wrong choice. 

I started here and it's been great. The work, the people, the pay. It's shown me the reality that not everywhere is a landmine. Sure you could always hate it. But you can also apply elsewhere."
skoolies,fewbgly,t1_fewb0lz,1579407952.0,"I'm surprised that works but the more i think about it, the baseboard would spread the load allong the foam...

You use any sprays to prevent slipping under the foam? Or just rely on the bolts?"
skoolies,fewahib,t1_fevz8a1,1579407562.0,Woah that's actually pretty clever. Never thought to save some spray foam by going with foam board for the floor?
pics,feutnf2,t1_feu6k56,1579389770.0,Hahaha
robotics,fetdv39,t3_eqiohx,1579374359.0,"Robotics is broad. You need software/hardware/electrical/mechanical knowledge and skillsets. So if you already have dabbled in arduino and other microcontrolers... All you're missing is some ROS skills and then experience. 

I'd wager you could land a job if you took a couple crash courses in ros. Just do tjat snd start applying. I see way more demand for software heavy robotics positions than mechanical heavy robotics positions..."
