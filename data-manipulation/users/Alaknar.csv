techsupport,ffahasi,t1_ffaeg80,1579735725.0,"I remember my first build. Did everything according to the instructions, watched videos beforehand, felt pretty good about how I did.

So then I plug everything in, hit the power button and giddily watch as everything lights up and spins up. Everything, except for the monitor.

So I check if the cables are OK, plug in the speakers and I can hear Windows starting, it's just that there's nothing on the screen.

I put my head into the case again, triple-check everything - it's all good. Fire up the PC again - no screen.

It took me four hours of work and actually dismantling the whole thing and then building it almost from scratch to notice that I plugged the monitor to the built-in  GPU (which was disabled in BIOS) instead of the GeForce I bought.

I also remember my second build.

Put everything together, hit the power button - nothing. Checked everything on the outside - all good. Tried the power button again - nothing. Checked everything on the inside - all seems fine, according to specs. Power button does nothing.

So I took it apart, check every bit, put it back together again. Checked the power button - all good.

To this day I don't know what caused it because I'm 100% certain I didn't change anything when I was putting it back together again.

What I'm saying is - there's almost always going to be something that goes wrong. But the important bit (and one that I miserably failed at the first time around) is to stay calm, because then you see more, understand more. You can hear your own thoughts instead of the panicked ""ohshitohshitohshitohshit"".

If it seems dead, it can't get any worse. Just take a deep breath, a step back, drink some tea, and then get back to analysing the problem. 9/10 times you'll see what went wrong and fix it."

StarWars,feqfy9m,t1_feoi6e0,1579341353.0,">Everyone of your points is easily resolved by the FACT that Luke developed during the OT.

Did he, though? Fact check!

He rushed head on into adventure instead of doing the responsible thing in ANH.

He rushed head on into a dangerous situation to save his friends instead of finishing training in ESB.

He rushed head on into a mega-criminal's den without a solid plan and started killing his guards on sight (using what's universally accepted as a Dark Side power) and threatening him instead of trying to go for a bargain or even some Force Mind Tricks in ROTJ.

He then proceeded to get his arse handed to him by Vader and only got the upper hand when he finally lost his temper and gave in to the Dark Side's rage in ROTJ.

So.... Where's the development that makes his actions in ST invalid? Do you refer to that single, pretty lucky situation of him actually turning the sword off just before he kills Vader?

It wasn't done out of compassion. It wasn't his good will. It was done out of fear.

He chopped Vader's hand off and noticed that it was a robotic hand, just like his own. He feared he'd become the same as Vader and that's the only reason he let him live. All that ""I'm a Jedi, like my father before me"" is just something he was telling himself to make the situation look better, but the fact is - he was just afraid of becoming what he hated."

OT Luke was rash. (Pre-)ST Luke was rash.

OT Luke would go head on to save his friends. (Pre-)ST Luke would go head on to save his friends.

OT Luke had anger management issues. (Pre-)ST Luke had anger management issues.

OT Luke had a moment of clarity just as he was about to make his greatest mistake. (Pre-)ST Luke had a moment of clarity just as he was about to make his greatest mistake.

ST Luke is just tired after seeing that he's bound to make the same mistakes just because of who he is. He wasn't some great Jedi Master trained in the mysticism of the Force, he was an up-jumped moisture farmer who had a little training and a little luck. I mean... Even accounting for the ""months"" between ESB and ROTJ, he had close to no training at all compared to even the ""younglings"" who already had a couple of years in the Jedi Temple by the time of ROTS.
