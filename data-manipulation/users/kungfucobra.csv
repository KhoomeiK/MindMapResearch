bestof,fepsvak,t3_eq0wt2,1579330119.0,"One Saturday night my brother make me wake up to go out help a dog close to his office. We supposed he had something wrong with his throat because he wasn't eating for days (a guard told us). I thought to help him on Monday, but then realized eating is crucial so  I decided to go help.

Around 11pm we get to the emergency vet center, it was distemper. They told me the dog was in pain and has been for weeks. Nothing we can do, I pay for euthanasia and stayed by his side until the last moment. When they put anesthesia on him, his legs failed, he fell and I catched it so he fell slowly.

I swear to God, I saw his eyes and I just thought even if I just met him, this is one of the guys who represent dog species, an specie who has been fighting by our side for millennia and my heart was broken beyond repair. I never cry but then I cried as he died, as I told him: I'm here buddy, rest now. Everything is fine (I'm tearing up just remember him again).

I felt so powerless.

I left my home that Saturday to be a good Samaritan, but had to become an angel of death. It was the correct thing to do. but that void has been with me since."
