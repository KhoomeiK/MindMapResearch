Yeah, that's the keyword here. Try to stop living in it.

EDIT: To make the analogy in my original comment more accurate (you know, given the atrocities committed by white people against native Americans or black people, which, by the way, I'm not belittling in any way) just replace the *black Jewish guy from the US* with a *[Russian guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact_invasion_of_Czechoslovakia)* or a *[British guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement)*. 

Or, you know, focus on fighting actual racists, extremists and other vile fucking people this world is still full of instead of crusading against college kids wearing feathers in their hair..."
MadeMeSmile,fgqo7v6,t1_fgq84fz,1581028015.0,"> There's a big difference between putting a dreamcatcher up in your room (bonus points if it was made by native folks and ought ethically!) and dressing up with red face paint and a feathered headdress for Halloween.

Why? I'm not interested in doing either, so I don't really have a horse in this race... but why shouldn't I be allowed to? I'm a white European and I don't really have a culture per se, but if a black Jewish guy from the US wants to chase Becherovka shots with Starobrno while listening to Karel Gott and whipping girls' asses with a pomlázka, *why the fuck would I care in the first place?*"

Same. No show ever gave me the same feeling Lost did. I watched a lot of stuff over the years but I'm still chasing that dragon. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely flawed... But it just hit all the right spots with me."
