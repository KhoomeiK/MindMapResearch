PublicFreakout,ff9u51r,t3_esawu9,1579721368.0,"This great but just in case, for anyone watching, this is not the proper method. Take the time to watch a video on YouTube or something now so that if you ever have to do CPR on a dog or cat, you know what you're doing.  Major props to this man though for saving that dog."
relationships,ff3aq0g,t1_ff2xwzm,1579537533.0,"If he is a stay at home dad, that sounds like something that is squarely on his list of responsibilities.  Don't take that burden on yourself- he needs to do it."
relationships,ff3aegi,t1_ff33s4e,1579537356.0,That's not modelling healthy behavior or a healthy diet for your daughter though.
relationships,fesjzs4,t1_fesbzky,1579366015.0,Don't drop hints. Be forthright and communicative.

relationships,fe0ctk2,t3_enjil5,1578810114.0,"Reverting into being a child sounds like a maladaptive coping mechanism - one that could lead to more trouble down the road.  I'm not too familiar with it, but it seems like a heavy form of escapism and escapism just isn't any way to productively deal with problems or live life.  I might recommend suggesting therapy so he could deal with stress/trauma etc. in a way that is healthier and more head-on."
relationship_advice,fdzay4r,t1_fdx719d,1578788351.0,I guess that means the issue is now that she has a medical problem that keeps you two from having a sex life but she will not get medical attention for it.

relationship_advice,fdx3v49,t3_en8dru,1578765028.0,She needs to see a doctor. Having to ice her crotch after sex is not normal at all. No wonder she doesn't want sex.
relationship_advice,fdx1du5,t3_en8di7,1578764288.0,He is suuuuuper unprofessional and downright sleazy. But so is your girlfriend for not maintaining boundaries.  He is her boss and should not be offering to be her sperm donor but she should also be doing her part to be shutting this down. It seems like they're both enjoying the attention.  Be prepared to get another job when this goes sideways.
relationship_advice,fdx03nr,t1_fdtm8zl,1578763961.0,If you have to resort to sleuthing - especially about something so disturbing and sexually abusive - then your relationship is already dead. Walk away and leave this as a bad memory.  You already saw her straddle her own son. That's more than enough to tell you she is dysfunctional.

relationships,fdwkidr,t3_en6t52,1578759672.0,I would probably follow her lead. Give her a friendly smile in passing and see how she responds.
relationship_advice,fdtaqnq,t1_fdscovp,1578714136.0,"The idea that passion is at odds with boundaries is ...alarming.  Also discussions about boundaries don't necessarily have to be ""sterile"", they can be part of the fun.  Lastly, why wouldn't someone just tell you ""she only likes it hard when her nipples are like bullets""?  Why would you have to figure that out?  Rough sex shouldn't be metaphorically just stumbling around in the dark until someone gets hurt."
relationship_advice,fdrh3gc,t1_fdpfcep,1578684492.0,Fuck ups are not how you find boundaries - communication is. Keep fucking up in order to determine where the line is and you'll lose your significant other fast.

relationships,fdkfjzd,t3_eltf1e,1578502802.0,"Somebody else mentioned this, but if you truly love her like you say you do but don't particularly feel drawn to seeing her as would be normal in a relationship, then maybe you should look into avoidant attachment styles and see if that sounds like you. Perhaps it could clear some things up."
relationships,fda5blr,t1_fd9tqqr,1578241878.0,Yeah theres definitely a consent issue there.

relationships,fcyosbu,t3_ejkfg5,1578084055.0,"If you don't like her, don't be in her wedding. The next time she pulls some jerky stunt, let her know you'll be stepping down as bridesmaid. She clearly doesn't like you so why bother?"
aww,fcyhhhs,t1_fcy54ae,1578080229.0,Can I be annoying and caution against using petsmart as a groomer? They have a history of not keeping up to hygienic standards. A dog one town over from me just died from it.
AskReddit,fcwacun,t1_fctfl6p,1578020809.0,This almost exactly happened to me when I was just waking up one morning. My hand went through my stuffed animal. Turns out it was just a hallucination upon waking up from a deep sleep.

AskReddit,fcv47ex,t1_fcuzmgj,1577994302.0,"Ah, sounds just like Boston. Especially the insanely inflated housing costs. My parents house that they bought in the 80s for 80k is now about 360-400k. You grow up assuming you'll have a house and then over time realize that your adulthood will be nothing like your parents' and if you have kids, their childhood will be much worse than yours was. You have my sympathy."
AskReddit,fcv3i4r,t1_fcv15ad,1577993887.0,"Wind buddy! I love wind too! It's so dramatic and when you have a good, full rain storm going, like a hurricane,  well that's just the best."
relationships,fcne7ww,t3_ehv1vh,1577809871.0,This is so hard and my heart breaks for you. It sounds like you've done all you can. He has proven again and again that he will not help himself and you've tried so hard. Your only options now are a) stay and watch him slowly kill himself while you continue to become his caretaker or b) leave and give yourself the love you deserve.  We always hope that the love our partners have for us will be enough to motivate them to take care of themselves but sometimes it doesn't work that way.  Think about what your life would look like if you stay.  Watching him die over time.  Resenting him. Becoming his nurse more and more. Paying the medical Bill's. You'll begin to hate him. The best thing you can do for him now is to love yourself enough to walk away.
relationships,fcndcv1,t3_ei0x0q,1577809310.0,"This is a harsh truth but maybe it will help motivate  you:  It's likely that at some point your boyfriend will tire of having a girlfriend that isn't at the same level of independence and maturity that he is.  If you don't start taking all of your adult liberties, you could lose him."
