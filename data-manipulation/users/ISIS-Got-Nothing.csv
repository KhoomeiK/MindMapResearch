6. The US at a negotiated peace with Iran where diplomacy could begin

7. The people of Iran were demonstrating against their oppressive theocratic regime.

4. Iran enriching uranium again

That implies that these couple of guys being dead made Americans in the region immediately safer while we pulled out. Also, Trump sent 3,500 more troops just after escalation (an airstrike at an intl airport, real gentle), which puts even more of our guys’ lives at risk.
