You don’t have to like women being drawn like this, I personally think it’s tacky, but gatekeeping art is so fucking stupid. “I don’t like this, it isn’t real art!!” 

You are implying that sex can’t have weight, meaning, or passion to it. You can’t just rule out an entire section of the human experience as inherently unartistic because it’s a little unsavory to you."

worldnews,fdnfpxp,t1_fdnecv7,1578584835.0,"You got it, chief.

Donating to conservationist charities, voting responsibly, and choosing products  from companies with ecofriendly practices are all things you can do if you care about these issues but not enough to dedicate a large portion of your life to it.

Of course it comes with the caveat that you’re going to want to be well read (even well meaning charities/companies/policies can be founded on damaging misconceptions) and that not everyone can afford to donate/afford higher products but how strongly you feel about these issues is going to impact what all you can do.

I know you were joking, but you really can’t blame everyone for going about their every day lives. It’s tough out there, and even for those who are passionate about conservation life is still gonna keep throwing curveballs. Many just CAN’T do as much as they’d like."
worldnews,fdndjlq,t1_fdnbjqb,1578583500.0,"The convenient thing about that question is that you don’t get to ask it, so that’s convenient.

Tl;dr: If this is something that matters to you then you need to explore the situation and address it in your own way.

If you want to accomplish you need to do so in the way that is right for you, but no matter what the issue is simply sulking about how shitty your situation is isn’t going to do anything. The unfortunate reality for problems this large is that no one thing is going to fix it. Personally I think pursuing research into conservation is helpful, but if everyone just researched this stuff nothing would get done. 

That’s why I feel it is best to be vague. I can not possibly list every way you can help, and I’d rather not limit someone’s scope by presenting them with a fixed number of options."

todayilearned,fdbtgh4,t1_fdaigpq,1578261786.0,"Interesting. So far I really like research, but if I change my mind I might be out of luck. My major is biological anthropology and if my professors are to be believed(/I am understanding them correctly) there really isn’t an industry for anthropology. Conveniently a lot of the stuff I specifically am interested is applicable more broadly to biology in general, (and if there isn’t industry work for biology I guess I have to turn to a life of crime) but I would like to stay in anthropology if I can.

I don’t mind doing less hands on research because the theory of it is more interesting to me. Of course without having actually been in that kind of position I can’t know if I would enjoy it, but cooperators, funding, publishers, etc reads to me as “focus on influencing the field” which is all I really want to do atm. 

I know that sounds kind of pretentious but ayy lmao.

It is the experts within a field who write these texts. To imply that the problem is that the men writing these can’t know what they are talking about because they don’t have periods suggests a very specific systemic issue, but the reality is that this is how virtually all treatments are handled.

Either a gargantuan portion of medical methodology is deeply flawed, or this isn’t actually the problem.

Personally I believe /u/zumera gave a more accurate summation of the situation. Perhaps doctors (possibly both male and female) are not taking self-reports from women as seriously.

“ Heavy menstrual bleeding is very common. About one third of women seek treatment for it. Heavy menstrual bleeding is not normal. “

Anxiety disorders aren’t normal either but odds are about 1/4 people you meet are going to have one. Common=/=normal. It’s not like these texts are shaming women who have painful bloody periods. What’s the problem?"
