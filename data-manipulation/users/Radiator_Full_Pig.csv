Games,ffgdjf9,t1_ffg7gqg,1579903841.0,"Same for me. You had an interesting decision to make every turn, with drawing two and being able to put one back. I played a bit after that change, but it really was a shadow of its former self. 
Great while it lasted, though."

Sorry I didnt think of it sooner, folks. Crisis averted now!"
boardgames,ff8zp37,t1_ff8yhgu,1579701085.0,"But in the Realms game, the game is the drafting (purchasing from the shared market)? Its not just something that happens at the start and you spend 45 minutes playing it out, its pretty much the totality of the game..."
boardgames,fel4h8i,t1_fekbndk,1579213863.0,"Santorini is a great game, Ive loved it so far.
Its really a 2 player game, though. It says you can play 3, but its a bit messy like that. 4 player can be fun, but 2 is the main way.

Not sure if you needed it to be 2-6.
Ive heard great things bout Concordia Venus, but i still have to find a resonably priced copy."
boardgames,fejydcg,t1_fejxwsr,1579188653.0,"Good point.
For me, I think its useful not only for searches but to get a quick idea of what the game might broadly play like. A lootshooter is usually going to have a different feel to a military sim, for instance. They might be FPSs both, but not always going to appeal to the same people. 
I suppose that comes down to sub categories, or what two main mechanics a board game might combine, etc.

I think those BGG pages are really useful, i can spend a good bit of time going through them. Thanks!"

boardgames,feidatw,t1_fei7nx2,1579135830.0,"They are similar. The SU&SD folks have appeared on their videos and they reference them a few other times too. They are aware who they are like.

I personally love them, its not like there are enough SU&SD videos...

It would be like complaining a different gameing website also does humour in its articles, like PC Gamer did, or something."

ireland,fe55gg8,t3_ensfdj,1578865795.0,"Your story is similiar to mine, when I was in college.
Though it doesnt seem like it, a lot of these problems are a matter of outlook. Depression can get you feeling helpless/hopeless and isolated from everyone else.

And you dont need to have depression to seek help from a therapist or counselor. See if you college has someone, they should. If not, see a GP and ask for a referal onto someone else after you explain your situation.

I dont drink, I was very depressed for years. My future always seemed really bleak. It can get better with time, but you do have to work on it. Just like staying physically healthy doesnt come with a bit of effort, our mental health needs a bit of effort as well. Its worth it, though."

boardgames,fdlpfw6,t1_fdkgl2e,1578529359.0,"Over 300 hours in slay the spire. One of the best purchases I ever made.

After playing a good bit, i thought it was a bit too random. Watched a really good player explain his thought process, realised I was just making loads of mistakes, and started doing way way better.

Loads of depth, excellent balance. And I have barely touched the mods that are out there. Base game has so much in it."
CompetitiveHS,fcymjp2,t3_ejkf05,1578082793.0,"Yes yes yes.

 Especially since someone who is talking over a replay could potentially fast forward through obvious or uninteresting parts, while slowing down or pausing the game to talk about dense turns."
bodyweightfitness,fcsq6m0,t3_eihtah,1577922317.0,"You are fairly close to my story, just a bit over a year ago.
Check out convict conditioning by Paul Wade. The author is very annoying in his writing, pretty sure he insults body builders every page of writing.

 But the exercises the book have the best easy start, most of the others I tried were too hard for me to start with. 

Then I read ""You are your own gym""
After that I was ready to read and buy Overcoming Gravity, which is considered the bible of Body Weight Fitness, its a hefty book though.
Id personally go Convict Conditioning, with the aim of getting fit enough for the recommended routine, then onto Overcoming Gravity.

Remember not to push yourself too hard. Just causes injuries and setbacks. Steady progress is the way. I had DOMS every day for the first few months. I think I could have cut back the intensity, recovered easier and progressed smoohter/faster.

Intermittent fasting helped me lost weight, too, or at least it helped me eat less and still feel satisfied."
boardgames,fb4b0pk,t3_ebf395,1576505403.0,"Catan was the first for me, or maybe axis and allies.
After that I bought Chaos of the Old World and Cosmic encounter.
Dislike both, never found them fun. Chaos is too convoluted and unbalanced, group isnt right for Cosmic Encounter.
I still mean to go back to them, eventually. I just have other games that are a bigger priority.
I bought Civilization board game for my brother next. Way way too long. Will probably never play it again.
Those three bad purchases put me off buying new games for quite some time.
Bought Flamme Rogue and El dorado.
Flamme Rogue seems kind of lackluster, absolutely love El Dorado. Reinvigirated my loves.
Bought Tigris and Euphrates (excellent), Arboritum (really good), Santorini (Excellent), Inis (havent tried yet) and one or two others."
