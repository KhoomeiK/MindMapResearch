Do you mean quid pro quo? Even so, as I pointed out, VA honors CCWs from every state, but not all states honor VA's CCW, so it's not reciprocal, and nothing was received in exchange for VA honoring those state's CCWs. Regardless, if it's not a legal agreement, it doesn't fall under that clause. 

My point is that each state can/does unilaterally decide if they want to recognize the other states CCW, which means it's not a state-to-state agreement. There is no legal agreement/contract between the states as far as I'm aware.

Your example of the tradesmen licenses may be different, I'm not familiar with the details of it. I'm only talking about the first example you gave, CCW reciprocity.

There are many example of interstate compacts, no one is saying they don't exist, driver's licenses' are a good example. Looking at the example you gave the [New England Board of Higher Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Board_of_Higher_Education) (which is what enables the New England Regional Student Program) is another good example of an interstate compact (which was created in 1955 and approved by congress)."

I thought I mentioned that. But regardless, has there been a follow up study since the 1/person/month limit was lifted? Have they seen a relative increase in illegal guns being from Virginia? Should be straight forward.

>""Purchases in excess of one handgun within a 30-day period may be made upon completion of an enhanced background check, as described in this subsection, by special application to the Department of State Police listing the number and type of handguns to be purchased and transferred for lawful business or personal use, in a collector series, for collections, as a bulk purchase from estate sales, and for similar purposes""

I interpreted that as bulk purchases, not multiple purchases. Intended for transfer of entire collections, not multiple purchases, but I could be wrong. I don't believe that would cover multiple vendors at multiple instances during a 30-day period.  

> Yes. This isn't a new concept, one-handgun-a-month provisions exist elsewhere. We already have the data.

The data you've been presenting is in relation to confiscated handguns, I was asking about total handguns in circulation. 

> I feel like this proposed law isn't a significant burden

The 1/person/month is a tiny aspect of the law, the general outrage is about the more significant components of SB16, in particular, the classification of many modern firearms as ""Assault firearms"" and prohibiting them outright, with no grandfather clause or grace period. Although that bill was withdrawn, the current version, HB961, allows grandfathered firearms, but requires their individual registration and a permit per firearm, although many handguns that people commonly carry may no longer be allowed unless new magazines are manufactured."

I must be looking at a different bill/text which section outlines the enthusiast/collector exception?

>Because they go through more scrutiny to obtain their permit and are therefore more trusted.

It's the background check supposed to do that? I believe the CCW permit only adds a fingerprint check, not a deeper investigation. 

>Lower the total number of handguns in circulation, making it more difficult for criminals to obtain affordable handguns. This in turn is expected to lower homicides as the vast majority of homicides are conducted using handguns.

According to your own statements, it's a rare occurrence for someone to purchase more than 1 handgun a month and there are a number of exceptions to allow someone to do so, do you really believe that this have any impact on the total number of handguns in circulation? If the intent is to lower the total number in circulation, why not just straight up limit the amount of handguns in circulation (like NY taxi's), or that can be sold per month/year (would definitely drive prices higher, but more directly addresses the issue), or the number that an individual can own (this requires registration and tracking, though, which is higher impact)? Why attempt to do so in an indirect way except to try to deceive people? 

I agree that they're attempting to provide minimal impact, and handgun purchase limits were used to great effect a few years back to curtail out of state sales and trafficking, but that law repealed. 

If you want to limit guns in circulation, place a limit on the number a person can own, the number that can be sold. 

If you want handguns to be registered, require registration.

Virginia,feclznd,t1_fec4ulx,1578977215.0,"I guess I'm still confused why common matters from the legal standpoint. Are you saying that if no one interested in something, that it can be banned because no one would object? Why have the ban at all? Seems like a useless law to ban something that no one would want anyways. As an aside, In your example, though, I don't think Anthrax bombs would need to be banned directly because it'd already fall under existing laws related to either explosives, or the biological weapons convention. 

People didn't really care about bump stocks because bump stocks, like the old hell-fire triggers, are just bad technology, people did/do care when the laws that were written were poorly worded and effectively outlaws aftermarket triggers (https://www.gunsamerica.com/digest/florida-banned-ar-15-triggers/).

They'd be impacted even if they were willing to pay. Those extra costs/effort is the impact. But also, don't forget the dealer who are also impacted. 

But we still haven't addressed the real issue. What is the 1 handgun/person/month limit attempting to do? What's the purpose of the law? It's not like a waiting period. Traditionally monthly limits were used to try to limit strawman purchases and illegal interstate sales (people buying in bulk in VA and heading elsewhere to ""re-sell"")

I'm not 100% against the bill, I am against the 1/ handgun/person/month because I think it just creates a needless impediment and doesn't actually address any real issue not already addressed under existing law. I think the onus is on lawmakers to justify the laws rather than on the people to object to the laws."

Why does the percentage of long guns to handguns matter? I purchase more handguns than long guns.

Why's that? Most businesses don't like holding inventory for longer than necessary.
