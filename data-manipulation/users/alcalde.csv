She studies prejudice and structural inequality and her research has  illuminated the ways in which persistent racism continues to negatively  impact the lives of racial minorities in America. A [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103118301070)  she recently published, for instance, shows how participants were more  likely to associate poverty with blacks as opposed to whites. Her team  found that this association helps predict opposition toward policies  that involve economic redistribution, since it is widely believed that  these policies benefit blacks over whites.

This ""privilege"" nonsense was never needed to fight injustice before and we don't need it now. In fact, it seems to be a tool borrowed from our opponents. Back in the day, opponents of LGBT anti-discrimination legislation used to phrase the battle as LGBT people wanted ""special rights"". In fact, this characterization was used in the last Dole/Clinton debate by Dole. And what's a special right but a privilege? It's wasn't a privilege to want to be treated equally back then, and it's not a privilege to be treated fairly now. If something bad happens to a minority it's because they were mistreated, not because everyone else was treated special. It's a bassackwards way of framing an issue."

People are being made to feel ashamed if they weren't born in a dirt hovel or for having the skin color or gender they were born with.

To put it in Bernie terms, Bernie seems more concerned about going on about the privilege of billionaires and how he wants to make them miserable rather than talking about how he plans to build up the less affluent (well, other than making everything free). We can work on making things more fair for those disadvantaged without making those who aren't so feel ashamed for not having them.
