RainbowBridgeBabies,ffo1jg9,t3_eu55ey,1580073195.0,"There is nothing more pure or steadfast than the love and companionship of a dog, except perhaps for the love of a person and her son for her dog. I'm so sorry for your loss; it must feel like one of the rocks you've built your life on is gone. She got you through so much; it was her job to look after you, like you looked after her, and she did it beautifully. And she wasn't just your rock--she was your true friend. What a good girl. I hope the memory of her love, strength, and devotion brings you more joy than pain. 

I'd love to draw her, but I'm no artist. I wish I could, because her dark ears are such an adorable contrast to her sweet face."

Thinking of his tender heart makes me sad that he’s no longer here, but I’m happy to think of the love and kindness he brought to the world, and that live on in your actions and in your sweet memories of him."

RainbowBridgeBabies,ffg0l3b,t3_etbfgi,1579895863.0,"His beautiful eyes and his sweet little nose, lost in all that soft white fur... he was beautiful as well as adorable.

I'm so sorry for your loss. You two had such a deep understanding of each other--what a truly special relationship. I'm absolutely certain that he knew how hard it was for you to make that decision, that he was grateful that you went through that pain for his sake, and that he was thankful that you took such gentle, loving, unselfish care of him up to the very end.

I'm glad things are better for you now, and Moose must have been so glad that by standing watch over you he kept you going until you found happiness. What a precious friend."

GriefSupport,ff5bp5i,t3_ero07j,1579586422.0,"I'm so glad she left you that final gift. It's so lovely. What a wonderful and wise way to send you off on a life without her physical presence to guide you.

She would want you both 1) to be happy and 2) to miss her to the depths of your soul. You can do both at the same time. It was her last wish for you.

I'm so glad you have those ""in between moments"" when you can see the beautiful little things and experience the joy from them... she would be SO happy to see that. What a beautiful way to remember her--by finding the joy in beautiful, simple moments. She's right beside you every time you feel that joy."
RainbowBridgeBabies,ff5aua6,t3_erq2i5,1579585566.0,"She's absolutely precious. I'm not an artist so I can't draw a picture, but I love the idea of your getting such a special tattoo so she will never be even a millimeter away from you. I'm so sorry that you're still in this much pain after more than 2 years... it must be so hard. Your relationship was so strong it couldn't be broken by death, but I know it hurts to not be able to feel that soft fur and look into those bright eyes."
relationships,ff5a81y,t3_erot7q,1579584973.0,"Well, if I were in your position, I definitely wouldn't break up with him without talking to a counselor, because until recently you were happy and in love. You said that there was nothing that caused this... no fight, no discovery about a nasty aspect of his personality, etc... and you're dealing with, and are on medication for, severe anxiety and depression. So this change in your feelings didn't take place on a blank slate.

I'm sure it feels extremely weird and disconcerting, and especially at your age, without complications, kids, or financial commitments, it's probably not a good idea to stay in a relationship without love even if it's a long-term and generally amicable one. But since this change in your feelings came out of nowhere, and he's still the same person you loved for years, I personally wouldn't break it off without doing some investigation of other (medical or psychological) possible causes for what's going on.

One thing to ask yourself: are you still able to enjoy other things as much as you used to? Are your feelings about your favorite foods, art, your favorite TV shows, etc, exactly the same as they've always been? Or is this change in feelings 100% specific to him?"
relationships,ff4upul,t3_erisrs,1579572895.0,"One thing I'd emphasize is that your wife needs to give your daughter a way to save face. I do understand your wife's concern, but she wildly overreacted and basically forced your daughter to defy her. Besides, your daughter holds a lot of cards--at 16 she can't be kicked out, and you can't control her behavior when she's at school. It behooves your wife to acknowledge that she will not win this. 

Your wife needs to back away from ultimatums and, however unwelcome this is, come to grips with the fact that your daughter will ramp up her defiance if you all can't find a way for both parties to back down. Maybe before they go out alone together again, invite the kid over for dinner or a movie night or otherwise find a way to spend some time with him and get to know him. It sounds like you guys could be a positive influence on him like your daughter has been so far.

Your daughter sounds really delightful and responsible. That's such a great baseline to start from; she's earned respect and she deserves to have her feelings heard."
Chinesetourists,ff4e9pf,t1_ff4cmc5,1579561545.0,"Well, I'm a vegetarian so no pigs are ever slaughtered on my account, and I certainly wish there were no slaughterhouses. But even people who eat meat should be disgusted by this, because making animals suffer for *entertainment* is sick and twisted. 

Also (and I cannot believe I'm saying anything positive about slaughterhouses, but it's relative), the point of slaughterhouses isn't specifically to make animals suffer, and this stunt was. Like dogfighting, or when sociopaths light animals on fire... it's especially revolting when the *entire* point is the terrified suffering of a helpless animal.

It just breaks my heart to think of this poor pig--whose life probably 100% sucked all along anyway, because China--suddenly being taken out of its environment that was at least familiar and made to feel this absolute terror, over and over again. And then get taken away to be killed anyway."

Maybe take a look at r/Parenting to see how those posts make you feel, both the serious ones and the cute ones. Of course, they aren't going to be snapshots of an average day of parenting--nobody's going to post about how they read their kid a bedtime story and tucked them in and they fell fast asleep--but they're examples of the kinds of issues that can come up."
relationships,fehnyy7,t1_fehlecr,1579120396.0,"I like this answer. When I first read that OP's boyfriend didn't want her to get a job, I immediately thought this was a huge red flag. But maybe he's a nice guy who romanticizes the idea of supporting his family. It's easy to imagine that kind of thinking from a 19-year-old guy in his first serious relationship.

I hope he's just being an old-fashioned guy who thinks it's the man's job to provide, especially while you're in school. But OP, if you think he won't want you to work after you graduate, your gut may be trying to tell you something. Maybe he won't want you to work after you graduate for loving reasons, and maybe he won't want you to work after you graduate for controlling reasons. It's important to figure this out as soon as possible, especially before there are any kids. What I would suggest is that you tell him that you appreciate his hard work so, so much, but that you genuinely want a job because it would be good for your self-esteem. It might be best that you don't make the conversation about money, in case his ego is the reason he doesn't want you to work, although money is a perfectly good reason; it's just that leaving it out of the conversation for now might help you figure out whether he wants to control you or simply wants to provide for you according to antiquated ways of thinking. If he cares about your happiness, he'll support you in finding a job.

If he still forbids it, that is a *huge* problem. He's not the boss of you."

I don't think anybody can be truly mentally prepared for losing a beloved pet, especially because we (usually) have to take an active role in deciding when it's time. It's the saddest and hardest thing, because in a way it's out of our hands, but it's not really out of our hands. It's so, so, so hard. What has comforted me in the past is that our beloved ones don't fear death the way most humans do. They have the wisdom and instinct to realize that it's time, and it's okay, and it's not scary. Of course, we humans are absolute wrecks through the whole pre-grief and grieving process. But to them, it's nature taking its course.

relationships,fdyrx14,t3_encilj,1578782943.0,"I nearly missed this part: ""He told me if I was more comfortable with them just being friends with benefits, that they would be ok with that."" 

So... not actually polyamory, he just wants to have sex with more than one person? Okay, fine, whatever, wishing for that is not unheard of, but his making lofty excuses about it is kind of icky. He wants to keep you waiting around, feeling all virtuous because at least he's been honest with you about his going outside your relationship (while knowing that your heart is breaking... but at least he was honest, right? He's being such a good guy, right?), while he has what he has already said will be a temporary fling. And he wants you to be friends with her?!?! Ridiculous. My stomach is hurting just imagining how this must make you feel. It's not my place to judge, and I'm sure polyamorous relationships can work for people who are willing and consenting participants, but this guy just sounds like he wants a fun mistress as well as a loving and steadfast wife. Again, not an uncommon desire, but a selfish one.

I was in your position with my first boyfriend--without the 11 years of history, which obviously makes it so much harder on you. I wish I had broken up with him the minute he decided he didn't want to be monogamous, but I thought that being the super cool awesome girlfriend who let him date several other girls and even take someone else to prom would convince him that I was the bestest girlfriend in the whole wide world. Pathetic. It did such a number on my self esteem for a long time. I'm hella embarrassed that I let this happen, but I want you to know that you're not alone in trying to make an impossible situation work.

I guess it comes down to which he cares about more: sex with someone else, or considering your feelings.

You are not being selfish. Good heavens. Absolutely not."

The world can be a tough place. Life is so tough sometimes. And without denying any of that, it can sometimes be wonderful. Just think of the joy he gave others... I feel like the world is a better place simply from having had him in it. What a gift he gave the world. And what a gift you give the world, simply by being in it, being who you are--kind, welcoming, thoughtful. The world truly is a better place for having you in it. Yes, it's a difficult place too, full of suffering. And you help to alleviate some of that suffering. 

Your last line worries me. I understand the desire to leave all the ugliness and pain behind. But you sound like an extraordinary person.

A book that I think might bring them a lot of comfort is ""Always Remember"" by Cece Meng. It's lovely. It's basically about how the ripples from a person's life continue long after they're physically gone. I think it would be perfect for your little ones and consoling for you as well.

Also, it's funny, and I think that might put some people off, but that doesn't mean that the information they give isn't good; it is.) I think it's really effective at communicating the weirdness and wonderfulness of the quantum world, which is maybe what a non-scientist would be looking for.

Just a hint—I’m American, and in America it’s not unusual for people to ask “what do you do for a living” as small talk. Most people don’t necessarily find it personal. However, I definitely think it is. Through bad luck, bad choices, or lack of opportunity, many people are embarrassed by their jobs, especially if they aren’t well paying. I’d recommend waiting till people bring their jobs up themselves rather than asking them. Sports, hobbies, and favorite TV shows are usually safe. Or you can ask for recommendations for fun things to do in the area that most people don’t know about, or about their favorite websites, recipes, or books.

Advice,fcvvt40,t3_eiz2lv,1578011229.0,"I haven’t read all the comments so maybe this has already been suggested, but maybe you could call down to the front desk (from your room phone, so they know you’re a legit guest there) and explain the situation, ask for a different room (so he doesn’t have the keys), and leave your bags there so you can enjoy London! Personally I would spend my days at all the free world-class museums, but you could also just walk around and explore. Or ask the front desk staff what they recommend within walking distance. I’m so sorry this happened and I hope you can make fizzy lemonade out of these lemons."
relationships_advice,fcsv2u3,t3_eiku4o,1577925852.0,"I took the liberty of looking at some of your past posts. I'll just ask whether someone who loves you or even cares a little about you would treat you like he treats you. I think you at least suspect the answer.

The way he treats you is so painful to read... I can't imagine what it's like to live it. You've invested four years in this relationship, so I totally understand that it's hard to let go or to quit hoping that someday he will be kind to you, but the truth is that *it's not going to get better*. It just won't. He is not a nice person.

 I know it's going to be hard to let the advice you'll get here sink in, because what you probably want most of all is a bit of advice that will magically get him to change his ways and suddenly treat you with the respect you deserve, but... there is no such advice. There is no magic wand. He will not change; he's had four years to treat you well and he hasn't started yet. His abusive behavior over sex suggests to me that he is, unfortunately and cruelly, using you; that's hard to face, and my heart breaks for you. But you deserve to feel happy, not hurt or unwanted or sad, in a relationship. Please, cut your losses and move on. He does not deserve you. You are better than this."
findapath,fcqthn0,t1_fcqobk7,1577891956.0,"I know you said you didn’t want to do an online degree, but the University of Illinois has an affordable and high-quality online MBA program."
AmItheAsshole,fcph3nj,t3_eicu9y,1577863762.0,"You want 8 hours to have fun? NTA. Unless she is literally physically incapacitated by pregnancy complications, it is absurd for her to ask you to give up what will be your last carefree day for a few years just so you can, I don’t know, bring her a sandwich when she’s hungry? My second pregnancy kicked my ass hard, but I would never have dreamed of asking my husband to wait on me hand and foot 24/7. I’m actually kind of upset on your behalf. She may be uncomfortable but it’s not as though your presence is going to change that. Parents make sacrifices all the time for the sake of the people they love... so, unless there is a medical reason she needs you there all the time, it would be good practice for her to “let” you go have fun."
family,fcpc6dn,t3_eicv0r,1577857893.0,"I aspire to being half the person your dad is. What a great man. He may not be famous (well, now he’s Reddit famous), but he is a hero.

It’s inspiring just to read about him. I’m sorry for what your family is going through, and so glad for you that he was an integral part of your lives."
Menopause,fclnikl,t3_eht7jm,1577751959.0,Thanks so much for putting all of this together! That was really generous and thoughtful of you!
redlighttherapy,fcki0og,t3_ehgaum,1577725773.0,I bought a reptile lamp holder with a clamp (also from Amazon). I clamp the light to the edge of a coffee table and prop my foot up near it. It works great. Hope this helps!
DiagnoseMe,fckf3ni,t3_ehmdav,1577723915.0,"Has she started taking any new medication? Sometimes a drug reaction shows up on the skin.

Has she contacted her doctor?"
BeforeNAfterAdoption,fc7fgrh,t1_fc7dsae,1577505840.0,"I follow him on Instagram!! 10/10 would recommend.

I love how much you love him. He’s a lucky pup and you and your wife and your other pup are lucky to have him."
GriefSupport,fc78yr0,t3_egiv6c,1577500681.0,I’m so sorry. What a horrible shock. And what a lovely testament to his love for you that he could be at peace only once he knew you would be looked after.
DiagnoseMe,fc78tag,t3_egjdb1,1577500568.0,"I can’t get the video to play on my phone, but maybe you could google abdominal wall dystopia and see whether that sounds like a possibility. It’s also called belly dancer’s dyskinesia.

And the blinking could be another form of dyskinesia called benign essential blepharospasm.

But again, I can’t play the video, so I could be totally off base."
AskReddit,fc5utsa,t1_fc4ramv,1577466390.0,This is a great reminder. Thank you!
