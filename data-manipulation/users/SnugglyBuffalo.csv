politics,ff4q9z7,t1_ff3vh8i,1579569852.0,"I mean, I get how the legislative and executive branches work, and I know most states almost certainly wouldn't choose to change to proportionally allocating their electors. I wondered about proportionally selected electors because it takes the power away from swing states while still leaving greater voting power per person in smaller states. I'm curious what effect that would have on presidential campaigns. You would get more bang for your buck for campaigning in less populous states, but you'd still have an easier time reaching more people at once in more dense states.

It was just an idle thought about a way to take power away from swing states to decide the presidency while still giving rural states more power than they would have in a national popular vote.

Edit: Plus, if you're going to compare Senators and the President, we decided a century ago to start electing our Senators by popular vote. If they're not meant to have a direct interface with the people of their state, why do we elect them completely proportionately to the popular vote in their state?"
politics,ff3u55p,t1_ff3k2pe,1579548906.0,"Alright, so the winner takes all system is overriding both the popular vote results and the EC then. It doesn't change the fact that today's system doesn't favor campaigning for a broader group of Americans.

It would be interesting to see how the EC system would change campaigning if electors were selected proportionally to the vote totals in each state, or something else that's not winner takes all."
