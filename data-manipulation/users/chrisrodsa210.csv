mildlyinfuriating,fgkr6f1,t1_fgknmag,1580871787.0,"Feels fake? Nah man, boxes of paint cans were stacked on top that's why there's the impression of the can on the lid of the inside box. So really the weight from the other boxes on top of the cardboard box kept it from spilling too much. Down stacking the box tilted and some paint came out the side."
facepalm,fgjyddt,t1_fgjxy40,1580853810.0,They shipped it without a lid. Just the box itself was covering it. Had the box tipped it would have been a messy situation.
