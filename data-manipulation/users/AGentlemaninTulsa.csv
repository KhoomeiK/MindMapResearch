relationship_advice,fdfg8dx,t3_el3ris,1578360975.0,"I'm the old guy with the cold hard truth. Number one, you are a good bit overweight. Number two, it takes two emotionally healthy people for a healthy relationship. Here is my suggestion. Work to make yourself stronger physically, spiritually, emotionally, and cerebrally.
If you do that, it's a journey. You can certainly make goals for yourself. If you feel the need, find a good counselor to help with the emotional Journey. 
There are plenty of groups with activities for single people. That shouldn't be viewed as a hunting ground. But more along the lines of a classroom. Where you learn how to interact socially and you have fun doing things.
I found true love at 62."

movies,fc75o0y,t3_egk4i6,1577498207.0,"The great Peter O'Toole had a great line in the movie My Favorite Year.
When he found out that the show he was about to go on was alive broadcast he freaked out. And said
"" Live? What do you mean live? I'm not an actor! I'm a movie star!""
I think the Oscars are much more about being a movie star then they are about being an actor"
