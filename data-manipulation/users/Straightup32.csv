AskReddit,fgj0ltk,t3_eyr6uk,1580834707.0,"Absolutely. Jacque Vallee is a famous astronomer / computer scientist. He actually helped create arpanet which later became the internet. Needless to say, this guy was a genius. He was actually visited by a ufo one time and he became obsessed with studying aliens. He found that a lot of stories about ufos had some similar characteristics. A ufo would appear in front of them out of nowhere, and it would dissappear just as fast. 

He came to the conclusion that aliens weren’t traveling through space in a manner that we currently understand. They were more likely using a different dimensional plane to travel. Now, if this is true, then there are different dimensions out there that we cannot comprehend. And if that’s so, it is very possible that they could view us in a way that we can’t see them. 

Take for example a drawn stick figure. From our point of view, the stick figure is fully visible. But let’s give the stick figure sentience. How could it ever comprehend us standing over it and watching it if it only ever knew 2 dimensions."

MadeMeSmile,fggoeev,t1_fggnjkd,1580766071.0,"Well I suggested raising taxes after a certain percentage. It does not mean that their entire income will be taxed at 65 percent. I’m talking once they reach their tax bracket, any money earned beyond that will be taxed at 65 percent. And don’t get me wrong, I’m only throwing numbers out. I’m not married to 65 percent or anything. The point is that we refuse subsidies for the wealthy and raise the tax rate in their bracket. This would slow down the accumulation of wealth. Slower accumulation of wealth means more wealth spread out. 

And I’m not saying whether government employees are good or bad at their job. If we assume everyone is doing their job adequately, there will still be the issue of bureaucracy and multiple goals that do not always line up. 

And I don’t know how to respond to the last bit. I feel that we just have different opinions on that and I respect yours. But I do believe that reducing or eliminating pay for government officials would be beneficial for our country. I’d even meet you in the middle and say that these government officials should not be allowed to earn more that 70k (arbitrary number) a year. And that includes any gifts, earmarks and any other income received while in office."
MadeMeSmile,fggn6m8,t1_fggdihf,1580765349.0,"The original statement was that money was a motivator and that a higher taxation would reduce output. I simply stated that is not true. Money can still be a motivator. In fact, it is a motivator until the cost exceeds the potential profit. This has nothing to do with moving anywhere so I don’t know where you are going with your first statement. 


I do not agree with your second statement either. Our government is inefficient due to bureaucracy  and failsafe measures. That coupled with the fact that our government is centered around many different issues as opposed to one single issue. The employees don’t have anything to do with it in regards to them being lazy or not. They are getting paid to do a job, that’s it. I’m talking about the system. 

As for your third comment. We already have rich government officials. The only difference is that these officials became rich through their position in the government. That’s a problem. Having rich officials is inevitable. I just rather they accumulate their wealth through their own means as opposed to having us shell out the money for their extravagant lifestyles."

MadeMeSmile,fggaht5,t1_fgg4isz,1580757746.0,"The state

Maybe 5 times the amount of cost of living? The state decides what the average cost of living in each county/state is. If you make more than 5 times that amount, any amount beyond that is taxed at a 65 percent rate. 

Money will still motivate them. People will continue to do what they do until the cost of what they do exceeds the potential profit. So as far as economics is concerned, you will continue to provide a service until your profit margin is eaten up by the costs associated, in other words your equilibrium. 

The government isn’t as efficient as the private sector because the private sector is focused on a couple of goals where the government has many. If we were only focused on profit, our government will be efficient. But our government also has many other factors to consider. 

The number one thing our government needs is to get rid of profit politics. No more earmarks, no more salaries, no more donations. Make running the government a service and not a profitable job. You go in, do your time, and eventually you have to leave so you can go out and continue to make money to survive. With that, you only attract those that are willing to sacrifice their time to better their country. Believe it or not there are good people out there that want to make a change. The problem is that there are people occupying the government that do so because of the emmence power and money. They don’t want someone in there that will disrupt that.

3) learn to advance those cues. This is done by mirroring back what they do to you and adding a little bit more. Let’s say they keep looking at you, look at them back and smile. They touch your arm?

AskReddit,fgfsn2p,t3_ey84ao,1580746712.0,"I had this teacher who was so mean to me in 9th grade. One time there was a school wide contest about who could make the best scary story. There were no rules beyond it being a story and scary. 

Well everyone in the entire school wrote these long stories with dramatic build ups and devilish looking monsters. They were good in their own respect. 

I decided that I was going to take a different route. I ended up writing a poem. The synopsis was that there was a man mourning the death of his wife. His mourning was interrupting by the sound of kids laughing in his yard. Then next he could hear them in his living room. Everytime he checked for them there would be nothing there. The sounds turned into crying and screaming and slowly moved from the living room to the hall way and eventually to his bedroom door. By this time he was going crazy with fear and anxiety about what it was. Finally he confronts them one last time and all he finds is a puddle of blood at his bedroom door. 

The story was supposed to show that in the moments of his fear, his mourning ceased to be a priority. He was more worried about self preservation and eventually overcoming his fear. And that his mourning was destroying him. But that was the gist of the poem.

Point is, I spent a ton of energy and time on this thing. When I read it out to the school I was the only one who got a standing ovation. But I wasn’t allowed to win because the teacher told me that I cheated and although she couldn’t prove it, she knew it. She decided to remove my story from the contest. I ended up complaining to the principal about it so she just dismantled the entire contest. 

To this day I’m still sour about that. The poem was great in my opinion.
