madlads,fffaknn,t1_fff8km8,1579879715.0,"From my general understanding, the way most people interpret the concept of ‘God’ in whatever their religion is, is just a tool for self reflection, and a manifestation of hope. 

The fact that these same thoughts and techniques pop up in many cultures, theist, atheist, or spiritual, means that they’re probably both useful and an innate part of the human experience. 

Prayer is fundamentally the same thing as meditation or mindfulness.

I did awful things as a kid, my parents took my things away, but always gave them back after I’d served my punishment. If I’d found and used it, they’d have sold it (which is why I never ended up looking for it too hard, three months without an Xbox is way better than forever without one)

But when you try and use it on an android phone, you find out your phone doesn’t have it half the time, and if it does, you still can’t use it unless someone else has a phone that also has it, and that they’re both using the official version, rather than the manufacturer adding the same feature, but that isn’t cross comparable.

If android has a feature but people with newish androids can’t use it, it may as well not have that feature. This is why, after like 7 android phones, I bought an iPhone, it’s not perfect but it’s imperfect in the exact same ways as everyone else’s."

I also don’t really care if you think I can or not, I can. Not anything that’s high quality vodka, but the literal cheapest stuff you can buy? Genuinely tastes different. Most of those studies iirc are based on if people can tell how much it costs, right? Not, that they all taste the same. I couldn’t rank how much each costs, but I can just tell you, like “expert vodka tasters” can which tastes *better* to me personally, pretty sure could to if you just did a blind test with three brands. *Vodkas definitely taste different to each other*"
pcmasterrace,fejskf2,t1_fejq0yd,1579184810.0,"Considering you're using pounds, I live in the same country you do, Smirnoff is universally cheaper than Russian Standard. As I said, *spending a tonne* on vodka is dumb, but spending a bit is totally worth it. Even Smirnoff tastes better than own brand. Store brand is usually like £12 in ASDA, for a 75cl or a litre so for a couple more quid going up is *so* worth it. Whenever I used to buy own brand though, I always bought the small bottles, probably why I thought they were so much cheaper. 

""They're made the same way"" is true of most categories of products and yet different brands taste different. It must be very economical for you if you can't taste how shit the own brand stuff is, but I can."
pcmasterrace,fejpk7f,t1_fejp2uf,1579182539.0,"Knew someone would say this, it’s untrue. With vodka the more you pay, generally the less vodka you can taste once mixed. Bottom shelf is like 30% vodka taste, cheap brands, 15-20% vodka taste, middling brands it’s like 5% vodka taste and from there it’s basically marginal gains.

Go test it yourself if you don’t believe me, buy an own brand vodka, and then something like Russian Standard, which is usually between 2-3 times the price. You can still taste the vodka in the latter but no where *near* as much as the cheap stuff. Paying for marked up brands like Grey Goose is a scam, but a mid range vodka is worth every penny."

I did awful things as a kid, my parents took my things away, but always gave them back after Iâ€™d served my punishment. If Iâ€™d found and used it, theyâ€™d have sold it (which is why I never ended up looking for it too hard, three months without an Xbox is way better than forever without one)

Theyâ€™re the adult, they have to be better than the kid theyâ€™re parenting.

If android has a feature but people with newish androids canâ€™t use it, it may as well not have that feature. This is why, after like 7 android phones, I bought an iPhone, itâ€™s not perfect but itâ€™s imperfect in the exact same ways as everyone elseâ€™s."

I couldnâ€™t rank how much each costs, but I can just tell you, like â€œexpert vodka tastersâ€ can which tastes *better* to me personally, pretty sure could to if you just did a blind test with three brands. *Vodkas definitely taste different to each other*"
pcmasterrace,fejskf2,t1_fejq0yd,1579184810.0,"Considering you're using pounds, I live in the same country you do, Smirnoff is universally cheaper than Russian Standard. As I said, *spending a tonne* on vodka is dumb, but spending a bit is totally worth it. Even Smirnoff tastes better than own brand. Store brand is usually like Â£12 in ASDA, for a 75cl or a litre so for a couple more quid going up is *so* worth it. Whenever I used to buy own brand though, I always bought the small bottles, probably why I thought they were so much cheaper. 

""They're made the same way"" is true of most categories of products and yet different brands taste different. It must be very economical for you if you can't taste how shit the own brand stuff is, but I can."
pcmasterrace,fejpk7f,t1_fejp2uf,1579182539.0,"Knew someone would say this, itâ€™s untrue. With vodka the more you pay, generally the less vodka you can taste once mixed. Bottom shelf is like 30% vodka taste, cheap brands, 15-20% vodka taste, middling brands itâ€™s like 5% vodka taste and from there itâ€™s basically marginal gains.

Go test it yourself if you donâ€™t believe me, buy an own brand vodka, and then something like Russian Standard, which is usually between 2-3 times the price. You can still taste the vodka in the latter but no where *near* as much as the cheap stuff. Paying for marked up brands like Grey Goose is a scam, but a mid range vodka is worth every penny."
