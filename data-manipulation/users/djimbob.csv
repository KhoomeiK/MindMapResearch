Guitar,ff9ensg,t3_es7ujh,1579711382.0,"Rhythm is important but I find metronomes are kind of boring to practice with (especially ones that don't even highlight certain beats).  Practice sounds better and more fun and realistic with a rhythmic backing track, drum machine, along to songs, etc.  Playing with others you won't hear every click, but will need to play along with the groove.

Most multi-effect pedals (e.g., my zoom g5n or similar pedal has one) or practice amp (e.g., [my nuk bt lite](https://smile.amazon.com/NUX-Portable-Modeling-Amplifier-Bluetooth/dp/B07JMP2MFN)) have simple drum tracks built in (and I'm sure there are plenty of other options).  Even though the sample drum tracks from machines suck relative to real drumming, it's still a lot more realistic for playing with others.  Also loopers are fun and will have click tracks, so then at least when playing with a metronome you can have an underlying rhythm (and then turn off the click track - metronome and practice playing along with another guitarist -- a recording of you)."

theydidthemath,fen374l,t1_fen0xpb,1579275961.0,"Again, I don't think Bezos having a net worth of $100 billion or so causes anyone to suffer.  It's not like he took $100 billion out of anyone's pockets.  He created a wildly successful company, offering convenient products for cheaper than existing competitors.  People used said company to save money, the company then went public.  If you count the shares of the company he owns times the price people are currently trying to buy/sell shares of it, you get to his net worth of $100 billion.  Imagine some artist like Picasso had 1000 paintings valued at $1 million each, but wasn't selling the paintings.  You could say he's worth a billion, but it's not like he took that wealth from anyone (when the paintings are unsold) -- and even if he sold it, the money would be coming from super-wealth art investors (or stock buyers) not ordinary people.

I'm fine for complaining Amazon causes people to suffer when he treats workers in his 'fulfillment centers' like low-paid constantly-monitored overworked robots.  He causes people to suffer when his platform does things unfairly using their monopoly power (e.g., identifies profitable ideas by monitoring sales and releases a competing product), etc."

(Other than some in social media talking about it and standard PR stuff).

I think it does look good.  It doesn't look *saintly* or change my opinion of Bezos/Amazon.  I can think of thousands of other companies / ultra rich that I haven't heard of any donations from.

EDIT: I should add it's good when companies that donate actually announce that they do.  E.g., if Amazon publicly announces it $1M that puts some pressure on similar companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft to make similar donations (as well as ordinary folks).  If Metallica donates $1M, maybe other artists will feel compelled to donate similar amounts.  I can see the justification for keeping donations private (because you donated to do good and not get rewarded for it), but I think doing it publicly probably helps get more total donations."

But just him having $100 billion, I don't see as a source of criticism.  E.g., Page + Brin have about that much wealth and I'm not criticizing them over it, but they have their own issues.

Like if Bezos spent all his money and just tried to reduce the federal budget deficit (difference between taxes and revenue spent), the yearly deficit would decrease for one year from $1.1 trillion to $1 trillion and then Bezos would be broke and the deficits would rise to the same level next year."
theydidthemath,felympj,t1_felgy9a,1579234296.0,"Eh, I'm *mostly* fine with his wealth.  In a free market economy it makes some sense that money follows a power law type distribution.  Roughly speaking say there might be 1/100 employees who can be 10 times more productive than the average employee; 1 in ten-thousand who can be 100 times more productive, 1 in a million who can be a 1000 times more productive, etc.  Like when mere mortals look at the accomplishments of a [Jeff Dean](https://research.google/people/jeff/) and compare to an ordinary programmer -- it makes plenty of sense that pay is not equitable to effort/hours put in.  Or like if you were assembling a basketball team in a free market economy and made hundreds of millions more in revenue per extra win.  In such a scenario it does make sense to pay Lebron James or James Harden millions more than what you'd pay for some replacement level guy, because talent isn't equally dispersed.

That said, I also think his company uses significant public resources, should be taxed appropriately, the wealthy should pay their fair share, should pay workers a comfortable living wage at a comfortable fair job, should have to factor and pay for the environmental impact of their activities, etc.  E.g., I don't really care that Bezos has $100 billion or what not; it's mostly in stock of the percent of his company he built.  I also kind of expect he'll pull a Gates/Buffett and eventually give away ~99.9% of it to some sort of charity.  But I will judge him for working employees to the bone while not paying a comfortable wage, stealing products ideas from external marketplace sellers (by having all the sales data and connections with the producers), having a large monopoly on the marketplace, etc.  I won't even fault him for using existing tax law to avoid taxes if it's legal (personally, I'd do the same -- lots of tax dollars go for things I'm against like useless wars or farm/oil/coal subsidies).  I will fault the tax laws though or other tax avoidance schemes like pitting cities against each other for local tax breaks to build HQ2 nearby."
theydidthemath,felmao4,t1_feky0gq,1579225579.0,"Exactly.  I'm not going to declare Bezos or Metallica the next Mother Teresa or anything, but they did a good deed.  There are plenty of other multi-millionaires and billionaires who donated nothing as well as ordinary folk who did nothing.

I mean if Bezos paid his taxes, paid his workers well, donated 1% of his fortune every time disaster hit, yeah he could help out way more than he currently does.  On the flip side, if he had that mindset from the start he'd probably never have the fortune he currently has.  But I'm not going to shit on a person for donating to a good cause."

ParticlePhysics,fejyuhl,t3_epkro5,1579188955.0,"The standard model is a hodgepodge model that keeps changing as we learn more.  The standard model originally had massless neutrinos (originally all attempts at measuring a mass of the neutrino can only say it's less than an upper bound).  However, massless particles move at exactly the speed of light and as particles moving at exactly c don't age (relativity), massless particles can't change oscillate into different flavors.  However, neutrino oscillation has been observed (and the experimental results aren't strongly disputed), so neutrinos appear to have mass.

There are a several different types of modifications to the standard model that can give neutrinos mass:

None of these have really been added to the standard model yet, mostly because experimentalists are trying to gather evidence to know which model to adopt.

You still should notify them about it.  In grad school, my friend living in grad school dorms almost got deported over a similar issue.  Some person working their mail room kept ordering packages delivered to my friend's name using stolen credit cards.  The thief would intercept most of the packages (delivered to friend's name) and followed with tracking numbers, but occasionally let ones slip through with things he thought the friend would like (things about his interests) and he just kept the stuff thinking I don't even have a credit card, why complain?

Eventually he got interrogated (I believe he said it was by the FBI), but when it continued to happen and he started reporting every suspicious package and not opening them, they were able to catch the person in the mail room.  Also, if I remember correctly he didn't keep any of the stuff.  Maybe because someone fraudulently ordered it with a stolen credit card?

Guitar,fehhrwt,t3_ep1wtr,1579116799.0,"First, most people sound crappy when they practice or write songs.  So if you play electric, practice with headphones on instead of a loud amp, if your parents are home (and you aren't playing with others or anything) to be considerate.  If you always sound great during practice, it probably means you aren't practicing things that challenge you.

Second, your parents taste in music will differ from yours.  That's normal and I don't see why you care, if you believe you are making progress.  

However, I feel you may believe his comments are somewhat true which is a major reason why they hurt.  Usually criticism that hurts the most is when you feel its true.  In that case, you should stop and evaluate how you practice.

Try and make sure you are [deliberately practicing](https://jamesclear.com/beginners-guide-deliberate-practice) at parts of your guitar playing that *you* want to improve.  That is you are doing new things, challenging yourself, critically evaluating what you are doing right and wrong, working through difficult parts, planning out how you practice, etc.

You could get to a level where you can comfortably do play chords and basic strum patterns and then just learn a bunch of songs at the level you can play.  If you do this, you shouldn't expect to be making lots of progress; you've sorted of just plateaued in your ability.  You'll make some small progress, but only incidentally.  

But if you do things like record yourself, identify small things you want to improve, then practice with a specific goal to improve those specific things.  Maybe it's improve your ear, or practice scales, or technique, or speed up technique, you'll find you get better over time.  Like if there's a 5 minute long song with a couple measures of difficult parts, don't play the whole song to get to the one hard part.  Focus in on the difficult parts.  Play them half speed (or less) with a metronome until you can play it cleanly.  Once it's clean slowly speed it up (e.g., maybe 5% faster) until you can play it cleanly.  Don't try and improve everything at once, but small manageable things.

Deliberate practice is the difference between say ""studying chess"" (studying opening theory, tactics, strategy, analyzing old games to find where you or your opponent made mistakes, etc.) versus just playing games for fun and never doing any studying/analysis.  One way you get stuck in bad patterns, the other way you advance much faster.

Though I should add most of the time I play these days, I'm not deliberately practicing, I'm having fun and expressing myself, which is also perfectly fine (I'm not a musician by trade; it's a hobby) -- but if that's what you are doing don't expect to improve noticeably."

Head trauma while having active concussions symptoms is generally believed to be significantly worse than initial trauma (e.g., [second impact syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-impact_syndrome) can be fatal).

That said early research seems to indicates that it's the severity of the head trauma that leads to CTE and whether there was a  concussion or not seems irrelevant (the severity of impact is what matters).  Further, for people exposed to repeated head trauma, CTE only arises about 30% of the time, so there seem to be genetic factors in play.

It's not like a car accident where CTE is long term damage from your brain suffering damage at the actual impact.  CTE develops years after the impacts, where you develop dementia, behavioral problems, mood swings, can't think clearly, loss of motor control, etc.  The damage of CTE isn't from something breaking during the actual impact, it's from triggering about 30% of brains to start self-destructing in weird way (gradually accumulating tau protein and causing neuronal loss years later)."

That said there are other issues.  First it's a hash of the password, not an encryption.

Second though the lines are cutoff it seems the first lines are:

    $password = str_replace("" "", ""0"", $password);
    $password = str_replace(""0"", ""x"", $password);

Note, it's applied sequentially and significantly reduces the keyspace.  Imagine $password coming out of md5, had a part like `a b c`, but after going through these two transformations will become `axbxc`.  Note that the strings  `a b0c`, `a bxc`, `a0b c`, `a0b0c`, `a0bxc`, `axb c`, `axb0c`, `axbxc`, would also get transformed into the exact same string going through these two transformations.  This significantly weakens the password security.  Luckily they do it on the md5 hash which mitigates some of the problems (this would be horrific if applied to the original password); e.g., probably converts 128-bit password-space of md5 to something like ~100 bits (or similar) without doing the exact analysis.

But the main insecurity is these transformations are really easy for someone else to put into a GPU along with md5 and brute force to attack multiple passwords simultaneously."

programminghorror,fdwapr6,t1_fdusgyw,1578756786.0,"I mean there's a lot of horror here.

First, naming.  If the point is to sort, call the function something related to `sort` not `findStuffIDK`.  Index variables are customarily named `i`, `j`, `k`, and it's confusing when you have `listy` being indexed by variable `x`.

Second, functions should act on something not just modify variables that are supposed to exist in the context it's called.  Python passes lists by reference, so it's cheap.  Even if you want to sort in place, it's worthwhile to pass in as a parameter what's being sorted in place.  You know, so you could ever import this function somewhere else and use it.

Third, why have a IndexError on each pass through?  Just end your loop one element earlier with `len(listy)-1`, or start the range at 1 and compare element i-1 to element i.

You can argue that it would make more sense to make `bubble_sort_single_pass` an inner function of `bubble_sort_in_place` (or combine into one function), but I was trying to mimic the original design.

EDIT: Also I kind of hesitate to call this bubble sort as while it's still O(N^(2)) like bubble sort, it's significantly less efficient because each pass through doesn't recognize the part that's already been proven to be sorted; e.g., if you've gone through k passes, you can be sure that the last ~~N-k~~ *k* elements are sorted and never have to relook at them.  That said, a lot of this is moot, because `my_list.sort()` (using TimSort) will be much more efficient in general and there's almost never a need to implement your own sorting algorithm in python."

nfl,fdr4t6b,t1_fdqtzo2,1578679516.0,"I agree it would be unfair to have one lawyer represent two parties negotiating against each other like in a divorce or setting up a contract.  Like every issue they try to negotiate for one client is to the detriment of the other client that they also are supposed to represent.  Your lawyer often catches gotcha clauses that the client could miss and by representing both sides, one could presume they purposely overlooked something to benefit one side more.

But your example, seems fairly common.  It's common to get a buyer's real estate agent when buying property.  When I bought a house, we met our buyer's real estate at the open house for the house we bought (she presumably was open to representing other competing buyers) and made the offer through her.  She vaguely indicated that there were others interested -- there were other families at the open house, but we had no idea if anyone else made offers.  There's no real conflict of interest as she's just making the formal offer that's passed on to the buyer/buyer's agent who is deciding whether to accept the offer or make counteroffers. (After an offer is accepted, then the buyer's agent guides you through the rest of the home buying process -- inspections, lawyer, getting a mortgage, title searches, paperwork, negotiation of issues found on inspection, etc).

Armstrong scheduled interviews for both of his clients, though each team have their own initial HC preferences that factor into the scheduling.  Carolina made a decision on Ruhle quickly to prevent him from doing more interviews and probably did some hardline negotiating (this offer expires at X) to convince him to accept before he did more interviews specifically with the Giants (and possibly accepted elsewhere or got in a bidding war).  It's not like if McDaniels had a different agent, that the other agent would be able to convince Carolina to wait until after his interview (or that McDaniels could expect an offer)."

I haven't given up on Stidham, but he hasn't shown real promise yet.

That said, from Brady's perspective, I unfortunately think there's a lot of sense to leave.  Other teams could offer significantly more money AND surround him with more talent (albeit worse coaching and GM).

At some point you reach cap hell, because all the people you borrowed against the future with, have all this guaranteed money coming to them that goes against the cap. 

To some extent, that's why the Pats are in this situation in 2020.  The Patriots usually are quite good at not borrowing much into the future, but the last few years have been doing it more regularly and at some point you have to bite the bullet.  That is if we restructured everyone (converting salary to league min and rest as signing bonus), we could generate an additional $14.1M in cap room (that goes on to the next few years cap), but [that's it](https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/tools/roster/new-england-patriots/2020/6af4966611cb95e167ce5ed8734fdc8e/) without cutting players or asking for salary discounts.

The Pats currently have $42M in cap space (top 51) by spotrac under the scenario Brady leaves.  It would be about $18.75M if Brady unvoids the deal and stays at $30M salary (as negotiated last August).  Then about $5M of this will go to draft picks (draft picks will cost $9.4M, but a lot of that is already counted when they take a roster spot from someone else; 

Note we have other major needs.  We're losing two starting O-linemen from 2019 (Thuney and Karras), a WR3 (Dorsett), two backup linemen (Ferentz + Newhouse).  The defense will be worse without Van Noy, Devin McCourty, Collins, Shelton, Elandon Roberts.  And special teams will be worse without Slater + Ebner.

Our 2020 draft picks are #23 / #87 / #97 / #99 / #122 (plus four 6th rounders and three 7th rounders).  Last year to get OBJ + Vernon for 1st (#17), 3rd (#95), Zeitler (starting RG), Peppers (former 1st round pick), so I'd expect the starting price for OBJ to be more than our earliest two picks -- and that was in a scenario where the Giants were trying to dump him.

But generally speaking, the differences between $100 and $300 guitar quality are noticeable; while some of the differences between a $300-$600 and $1000-$2000 guitar are quite subtle, or a question of taste, or things that don't really affect playing (like brand on the headstock, where it was made, or similar).

nfl,fdhzmih,t1_fdhgnnx,1578433073.0,"Yup.  That's why I don't see Brady staying in New England.  If he leaves:

1. He can get paid more (other teams have more cap room -- we'll be paying him $13.5M if he leaves),
2. New England fans will still worship him for nine AFC championships, six SB rings, and two decades of GOAT level play,
3. He can find a QB-less team that has more offensive talent (and possibly overall talent) to surround him with and a better chance of a seventh championship
4. If he has success, he can show he did it without Belichick.

The only downside to leaving is the head coaching will be worse.  I'm sure plenty of GM/HC on the hot seat would be super happy to have a quality QB with experience who could win now (even if he's not a long term solution; he's also not a long term problem because he'll want a relatively short contract).  

If Brady stays for 2020 at the terms of his auto-voiding deal (where 2020 cap hit would have been $36.75M).  That leaves the Pats top 51 cap space at about $18M and no obvious candidates to cut to save space.

Furthermore, the 2020 team is losing tons of 2019 starters with little cap room to pay for replacements:

* Defense is losing: Kyle Van Noy, Devin McCourty, Jamie Collins, Shelton, Elandon Roberts.
* Offense losing: Thuney, Karras (two starting O-linemen from 2019), Ferentz (backup C), Newhouse (emergency OT) and Dorsett.  (Yes, Andrews is still on the roster and should be starting C, but blood clots are no joke and no guarantee he can play.)

I agree it's not the best game, but I honestly don't understand the 6 hour monopoly games.  An hour game would be long in my experience.  If you are good at negotiating deals and explaining to the other side how making a deal puts you both in a better situation (giving both of you monopolies or closer to them) relative to not making the deal, then you quickly get to a point where players can get eliminated.  You just need to have rules where you only negotiate for exchanging properties and cash (no negotiations for free or reduced rent or anything) and you don't have ridiculous free parking rules that introduce way too much cash (like free parking starts with $1000 or whatever).  It also helps that if you have cheap properties that you exploit the just 32 house rule to prevent other players from developing on their properties.  (That is you stop building at 4 houses a property, make the number of houses run out, so even if someone else has plenty of cash they can't upgrade.  Then when you get plenty of cash and have a new monopoly to build on, you wait until you have enough cash to complete the upgrade to hotels while using all the available houses).

If you play against people who don't know good monopoly strategy, it's fairly easy to convince them to make deals and win unless you have very bad dice luck and don't land on any property early in the game (and everyone does the obvious move to buys the properties they land on)."

Just like you'll still find businesses running legacy stuff in COBOL or controlling hardware using software that has to run on an ancient OS (usually because there's a million dollar piece of hardware from a defunct company that only released software for Win 98), so your best bet is to leave the machine running ancient hardware off the network.

So stop using it of course, except when you can't.  (E.g., complicated ugly spaghetti code you don't understand that doesn't migrate easily because there's C API stuff in there and you don't know the full logic to rewrite from scratch in py3).  And for those cases you can probably pay to get limited support.  Or just run in virtualized sandboxed old environments."

theydidthemath,fddsw10,t3_eko9h9,1578323132.0,"There's plenty wrong with the calculation.  First, homelessness would need an annual budget; so it's probably best to compare yearly military budget, which is about $700 billion of which about $150 billion goes to procurement (buying equipment) and another $100 billion goes to research, development, testing, and evaluation; the rest pretty much goes to pay + benefits and operations.  Meanwhile, the annual budget for [Housing and Urban Development is around $45 billion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development), most of it discretionary spending and their job is to provide affordable and low-income housing as well as run programs for the homeless.  Sure increasing it by $20 billion/year could do a lot to address homelessness.

It's probably true in some back of the envelope calculation like if you look at the homeless/near-homeless population and calculated the cost to provide affordable housing for them it would be around $20 billion/year.  Say there are about a half million homeless and add triple that of low income people who would take up a free housing opportunity if offered (e.g., it's an upgrade from living in a crowded house), and say it could cost $10,000 per homeless per year times 2 million people.  Note you probably need to provide housing and food for those without jobs.

That said the problem of homelessness is deeper than just having money to provide them shelter.  About 45% of homeless people are [seriously mentally ill](https://mentalillnesspolicy.org/consequences/homeless-mentally-ill.html) (e.g., schizophrenic) or have crippling addictions and the cost of treatment/health care would be much more than cost of basic housing.  Like you just give a drug addict a free food and housing and they may trash the place and turn it into a crackhouse.  And you won't solve their problem by just giving them free room and board somewhere.

And if these homes are safe and reasonable quality housing, what prevents relatively well-off people deciding to save $10k/year by not paying room and board?  You'd probably need some way of means testing and social workers and that's going to escalate the cost.  And there are plenty of unique situations like college students where your net worth and income is quite low (or zero), but you wouldn't be homeless without a handout from the gov't."

Obviously Brady can be great without Gronk (Brady's won four SB without Gronk), but you don't just need to replace Gronk's 70Y/G and 0.75 TD/G.  You also lose Gronk taking the best defenders to cover him that helps make your other offensive weapons get open."
sysadmin,fd83jjx,t1_fd61xmz,1578213485.0,"It's probably easy within the company that once this is detected to trace it back to someone (e.g., looking at old emails).  Someone decided to go with FakeCompany for services and didn't raise any alarm bells when no services were provided.  However, if they were smart about it, it *could* be difficult to prove the person who suggested FakeCompany wasn't just tricked by someone else and/or incompetent for not recognizing the company was paying for services not being rendered.  (E.g., I was embarassed and covered it up).

If they were smart about the shell account side of things, you can anonymously setup a shell business in certain states like Delaware easily as well as in certain off-shore countries (e.g., see [these](https://www.npr.org/2016/04/06/473279684/encore-planet-money-sets-up-an-offshore-company-in-a-tax-haven) two [podcasts](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/654792142)).  If he setup a few shell companies; e.g., a Delaware one that moves money to an offshore account and then the offshore account in Belize moves it to another offshore account in a different jurisdiction (repeat a few times) and then back into an American account that he uses; it could then be very difficult for anyone investigating the embezzlement to get his banking records tracing it back to him (because you have to get a judge to agree to hand the banking records over in each different country).

Meanwhile, they leave the country as soon as someone seems to be investigating FakeCompany.

He threw it away a lot of times (sometimes when people seemed open) in situations where he shouldn't have and seemed to be fairly inaccurate at times, though it's always hard not knowing if it's the receiver running the route/adjustment wrong or inaccurate Brady.  That's not why they lost today, but it's part of the reason why they were playing today.

The big difference IMO is the loss of Gronk.  It's like that comparison of Brady's stats with and without [Gronk from before the 2018 season (where Gronk was less effective) where prorating the stats to 16-game seasons](https://www.thebiglead.com/2018/05/24/tom-bradys-stats-with-and-without-rob-gronkowski-playing-are-staggering/):

It's $4.05M of savings by cutting him versus having him active for 16 games.  If he plays 16 games in 2020, we pay his $3.5M base salary + $0.75M in roster bonuses ($4.25M more money), but he was going to get $0.2M of it anyway (guaranteed) so its a savings of $4.05M.

Ignore the $1.2M pro-rated signing bonus, it was already paid regardless of whether he plays or not and is a sunk cost (and avoiding the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost#Concorde_effect) it shouldn't factor in at all towards future decision making about Gost).  Also because he was only active 4 games in 2019, his 2019 cap hit only counts the roster bonus as $750k*4/16 = $187.5k.  However, if he plays all 16 games in 2020 we'll have to use $4.05M more in cap space versus if he was cut; though $562.5k will count against the 2021 cap (when they do adjustments at the end of the year to see what LTBE/NLTBE incentives were actually earned)."

That said, I think it's more likely we'd draft a kicker late or bring in a UDFA for camp competition than re-sign Folk.  That is Folk can probably get a good shot at starting job without going against a kicker who is arguably on a HoF career path.  Absent a known lingering injury that he won't have healed up from by the time of camp, it doesn't make sense to cut Gost now (without knowing how he'll kick in camp.)  A lot of the reason Folk is good this year is that we've gone for it on 4th down at distances we'd have had Gost kick."
