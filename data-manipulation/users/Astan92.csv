YouShouldKnow,ffb81fs,t1_ffb5lqq,1579754524.0,">I have read this article up an down and can not make sense of your argument. Are you saying they went through the tax filing process, clicked the ""free"" option every time, and then by the end of the process TurboTax charged his credit card (of which the number they do not know) without his authorization?

Obviously not. I can't believe anyone would even suggest such a ridiculous thing. 

They went through the tax filing process, clicked free every time and were told at the end they had to pay, even though they actually do properly qualify for the free tax filing. 

This happened because when they googled free tax filing the link to the actually free as in does not cost money service that Turbo Tax was offering was not listed in search engine. Or they went to Turbo taxes site and were unable to fine the actually free filing link and instead followed the links that talked about free tax filing into the place where when you fill it out at the end it claims you don't qualify and have to pay, even though you do and if you found the other proper free file page you would have been able to file for free. TurboTax is knowingly and deliberately using dark patterns to mislead people into paying them money they do not have to pay. Anyone who falls for it got scammed. 

The podcast I linked goes over it in more and better detail, and I should have included this link as well https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-deliberately-hides-its-free-file-page-from-search-engines"
