space,ffgm5ny,t1_ffgh8g7,1579909446.0,"This is 5 minute google math so probably not super accurate but from what I can find the average profit per passenger on a 777 is about $18, so accounting for the fact that flights aren't always full and that's an average, I'll round that down to $15/passenger. Take that and multiply it by the number of passengers a 777 holds, which google tells me is around 300-400 so I'll say 350, then we get $15 x 350  = $5250 / flight.

I also found that the oldest 777 was retired after a bit more than 20,000 flights, so 5250 x 20,000 = $105M. I'm guessing the real number is a bit higher, maybe $150M, so they probably profit around 50-70% on top of the plane's value."
