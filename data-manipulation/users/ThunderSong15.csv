When I was younger, someplace in South Carolina. I don’t remember what the town was called but there was this really sketchy one. I  was with my mom and friend on a trip, and we were staying at my moms old friend’s house. It was a little mobile home, and there were holes in the wall, terrible smell, etc. I felt filthy the next morning and was grateful to get out of there. The town looked a bit more inviting at day, but at night it was some sketch.

Also when I was younger, my mom and grandpa and I went to Death Valley. The first night was already frightening: it was a very dark, winding road on the edge of a mountain(s). We were relieved at first to see some lights up ahead, but then I was creeped out because 1. There were like three buildings in this town (or so they called themselves) 2. The hotel checking wasn’t in the hotel, no, it was in a GAS STATION. 
Anyways, it turns out that we had made our reservation for Jan 19, (not that night) so we had to drive much more out of our way. Through Death Valley wasn’t nearly as scary as the next part. It was sketchy, a one-lane, dirt road, but we made it out of there and into the city. At first, we had to plug our noses when we were entering because of a big factory, (I’m not even sure what it was for) and I thought that was the end of it. 

Nope.

This truck (we’re still passing through and around the factories) pulled up in front of us. I don’t remember exactly, but it went something like my mom trying to pass the truck because it was texting while driving or drunk driving, and it got PISSED. The truck pulled over, and I guess it expected us to, but we took it as an opportunity to pass the truck because it was late and we wanted to just find a nice hotel and go to bed. It honked at us when we overtook it, and then— this is what freaked me out the most— it was on our ass. I’m not talking ten feet behind, I’m talking much, much closer. I wasn’t looking because I had my eyes shut close, but when I opened them again, the car was NEXT to ours. Trying to get passed us. We were neck and neck— mom wanted to just slow down, but Grandpa said, “speed up, speed up!” 

The truck got past us. When it did, it went much, much slower; obviously trying to... well, I don’t even remember. I was just scared. Then, the car pulled onto another road. Just like that, it was over.

But my mom, after a couple miles, noticed we were low on gas. We stopped at a gas station and there were people just standing and loitering. Let me remind you it’s almost midnight. My mom gets out for a minute, then rushes back in and gets the hell out of there. Never told me why. We got gas once we were in the city.

Sketchy, scary, and creepy. I don’t think I’m going there at night again."

I was barely good at staying on top of the deck, so I just  responded, “no, not yet. I’m not very good at skateboarding yet.”
Then the other girl went, “here lemme see.” 
At first I was reluctant; my skateboard meant a lot to me. These people could have easily stolen Freddie Mercury. (YES I NAMED MY SKATEBOARD FREDDIE MERCURY. NO JUDGING.)
But I was an outgoing girl,  and I had a good allowance, so I decided I’d just get a new skateboard. 
They didn’t steal FM.

The girl did an Ollie, gave FM back, and I went to get pizza.

I will never forget them. :)"
