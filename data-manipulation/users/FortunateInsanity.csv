At this point, watching his supporters continue to believe the things he says without question is like seeing someone with Stockholm syndrome make excuses for their captor.  It’s also eerily similar to abused spouses who continue to catch their partner red handed cheating on them, but then internally rationalize why they deserve to be cheated on and stay with their unfaithful spouse no matter how much it hurts them."

nottheonion,ff2zhao,t3_erbflf,1579529527.0,"I was lucky enough never to buy in to hard work always leads to a better life.  My mantra has always been “work smarter, not harder”.  Throughout my career I’ve seen examples where working harder seemed to be one of the reasons they were AS successful, but working smart seemed to be more of the reason WHY they were successful.  The tech giants come to mind.  

The “American Dream” the past several generations were sold became an empty promise around the 1980’s when the ‘trickle down’ theory became the dominant economic trend. At that point “working hard will lead to a better life” stopped being true for about 99% of Americans.  40 years later millions of people are drowning in student debt, minimum wage won’t support a family, and wealth is being funneled to the top (who now pay less taxes than the middle class) thanks to the stock market making share holder more important than the worker."

MurderedByWords,fcnmnnu,t3_ei0mws,1577814395.0,"Too many people mistake the right to free speech with a warped idea that all opinions have equal merit.  The only thing our constitution protects is the right of an individual to speak freely with retribution from the government.  There are no protections for anyone else from anyone else.  

Unfortunately, a grey area has been contrived within American culture by extremists where people think they have the right to say whatever they want, whenever they want, to whomever they want, without consequences, all while expecting their opinions to be treated as legitimate regardless of merit.  They claim to be disgusted by the notion of being dismissed by “main stream” society when they make an unverified accusation without legitimate evidence to support it.  Then they blame shift the burden of proof onto everyone else, which is the self-serving logic fallacy of proving a negative.  

This cycle of stupidity is largely the fault of our degrading educational system not instilling critical thinking skills from a young age.  The fallout of poor education is self-perpetuating, so if we don’t stop the downward cycle soon then there may be no one left to recognize it as the culprit.  With DeVos at the helm of our public education, that won’t be happening anytime soon."

It is absolutely terrifying that a chief of police anywhere has such a fragile ego that they felt compelled to do anything other than console the offended officer and report the incident to the manager of the restaurant as a standard customer service complaint.
