>Mia Farrow laughs again. And knocks on a wooden table.

>Never before, in fact, has she known such rock-solid support. Woody Allen functions as surrogate Dad to The Nine...."" -- [October 18, 1989](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1989-10-18-8901230277-story.html)

Soon-Yi was one of ""The Nine"" to whom Allen was being a surrogate dad."
