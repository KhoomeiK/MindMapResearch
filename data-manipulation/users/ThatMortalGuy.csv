Me and my family are from Cuba and back when the Soviet Union was a thing my mom and dad went there to do their studies and met there and later married, while there my dad was an avid photographer and took many pictures and one of the cameras he used was the Zenit. Fast forward many years later I was born and I took an interest into photography but living in Cuba during one of the worst time of the so called ""Special Period"" there was no film or way to develop the film, I was able to take some pictures but ran out of film and eventually had to stop (I remember I ended up breaking the camera because at one point I took it apart and could not put it back together)  
Fast forward to two years ago I went back to Cuba to visit and was able to find a lot of the negatives from the pictures my dad took in the Soviet Union and I have been trying to scan them digitally.   
I was able to find the same camera he was using on Ebay and bought it and now I'm learning how to shoot with film because I want to take him back to where he went to school and recreate some of those pictures with both my DSLR and the Zenit."

I have meet some very educated people, people who never went to school, people who besides knowing Spanish and English they also knew how to speak two dialects, I have meet people who came over and worked for a while, saved up money, bought a house in Mexico and then left to go live there, I have meet people who tried to do the same but ended up getting a girl pregnant and now they are waiting for their child to grow up before they can leave, I have meet people who tried to also buy a house but ended wasting all their money on beer and trucks, I have meet a couple who had two daughters raised them and sent them off to college and now they bought a house and are staying here, I have also met drug addicts who are going nowhere in life and some who have beaten the addiction and are doing good now. It's people from all walks of life and all kind of personalities.  
  
There are assholes like this guy here and there are some really good people as well.  
Anyways, what I was going to say before my rant is that I knew a guy who would come over, make some money and then go back to Mexico to live there and then would come over when the money ran out to make more or to visit his friends, when I asked him he said that it was getting harder every year to cross but he was not going to stop anytime soon. So yes, there are many people who come here to visit or for a short period of time."
