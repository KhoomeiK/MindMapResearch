depression,ffqo30q,t1_ffprlg9,1580139642.0,Oh it might be better than. it's fucked up in the US. Your stuff might be better. I would still bring books though.
depression,ffpnego,t3_euib6s,1580099464.0,I know how you feel. I have been thinking about starting self harming again. I can't tell my therapist because I don't want to get pulled out of work and potentially lose my job. I don't want to tell my husband because he will worry and start hovering and taking away my freedom.
depression,ffpn8dm,t3_euiga7,1580099327.0,"It isn't much fun, but try to rest and laugh when you can. Bring books and get some reading done. You will need to pass the time. And don't be afraid to speak up and advocate for yourself. You have rights as a patient. If you think something is fucked up, demand to see a patient advocate. You might not need to, but I think anyone staying in a hospital for any reason should know their rights."
depression,ffpmvge,t3_euimqh,1580099041.0,"I have the same problem. I started listening to podcasts, audio books, or TV shows about 10 years ago and it helps a lot."
depression,ffpmk7n,t3_eug7xu,1580098792.0,"I enjoy being an adult more than being a kid. Depression still sucks really bad, but it did get better."
depression,ffpkj3j,t3_eui69t,1580097271.0,"I haven't had all of your symptoms, but have had some. Pills helped me a lot. It took me a long time to find the right ones though. Maybe like 6 months or something."
depression,ffpk7jq,t3_eudwtm,1580097037.0,"I was in a terrible accident when I was 18 and walked away without a scratch. I think all the time about how I should have died that day. I was hospitalized earlier this year with serious pregnancy complications. I keep thinking about how even 60 years ago, I would have died."
depression,ff52lnm,t3_ern9vk,1579578523.0,Did some good for me. I had to try a few before I found something that helped though.
depression,ff52e4r,t3_erob11,1579578366.0,"I feel the same way. It's so hard for me to be out and around people, even if the event itself goes well."
depression,ff52a10,t3_erougv,1579578278.0,"I have spent a lot of my life self-harming so maybe me saying something is being a hypocrite, but it's probably best to try and head it off before it gets too out of hand. It can get away from you really fast."
depression,ff51xit,t3_eriz5y,1579578013.0,"If it helps, I know very short men who are married. There is someone out there for you."
depression,ff51rfj,t3_ermkdi,1579577886.0,"I got sent to a hospital for admitting it too. It didn't help me. It just traumatized me for months. I wish I had better advice. Sometimes my depression isn't so bad with a lot of drugs and therapy. It took years to get there though. And I don't tell anyone what I feel like anymore because when I did, all my friends left after the hospital didn't cure me and I didn't get better in the time frame they wanted. It is a lonely life always keeping it inside though. You can't really be close to anyone."
depression,ff29m7u,t3_er86vu,1579497894.0,I'm sorry about your dog. Dogs love us more than other humans ever could. I lost my dog 2 years ago. He literally saved my life when I attempted suicide. You will always hold that dog in your heart.
depression,ff29bll,t3_er7sup,1579497633.0,I hope you're okay
depression,ff298r5,t3_er57i8,1579497562.0,One time a psychiatrist would see me because I had been hospitalized before. I cussed out the receptionist. It made me feel a lot better.
depression,ff293rs,t3_er79p8,1579497433.0,"Whatever you do, dont tell your therapist you cut. I made that mistake and they locked me away for 3 days. It was traumatizing. I'm sorry I don't have better advice. The mental healthcare system in this country is seriously fucked."
depression,ff25irl,t3_er2c9d,1579494387.0,I'm 31 and I'm miserable. I wish I was more. I wish I could be more. It sucks.
depression,ff25gms,t3_er67gw,1579494338.0,I don't think they will. No one did when I was in the hospital
depression,fe67nt1,t1_fe5rjr7,1578883614.0,Same. You have to look at the scars forever and it sucks. I'm 31 and I still have scars from 15+ years ago.
depression,fe67kc4,t3_envt2j,1578883559.0,Try holding ice? It hurts worse than you think.
depression,fdtl1p5,t3_emz1be,1578718299.0,"I can't speak to the effects of smoking weed on depression, but meds were the best decision I ever made. For real."
depression,fdtgzuk,t3_en26jl,1578716623.0,It is for me when I am depressed.
depression,fdtffrx,t3_emtjyn,1578715993.0,"I give the same advice to everyone about therapy. You won't make progress unless it is someone you genuinely like. There are lot of different therapists with different personalities and techniques. If one isn't working, try another. I think I saw 3 before I found one that actually helped. Also, I don't know where you live, but my therapist is only $100/hr."
SuicideWatch,fdtah3s,t3_elj38e,1578714037.0,Your parents are the ones who are fucking awful and terrible. You sound young. Life gets so much better as an adult. I moved out at 18 and I haven't looked back.
