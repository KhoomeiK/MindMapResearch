ConvenientCop,ff7vawg,t1_ff76p5r,1579659206.0,Honestly most cops would let you off if you were clearly a tourist from outside of the states. The carpool symbol is standard across the US so there's really no excuse for a local.

I saw someone else in this thread make the argument that the refs couldn't flag it because Wentz wasn't giving himself up, he was a runner at the time, Clowney didn't initiate contact with the helmet (his shoulder hit first), etc. That's likely a gap that should be closed, but they can't flag him for a rule that doesn't exist."
nfl,fdu4gwg,t1_fdstpdm,1578727376.0,"He was 100% NOT giving himself up in this play, he was being (poorly) tackled by his ankles when Clowney hit him."

nfl,fdu28mb,t1_fdtygqi,1578726228.0,Honest question. The only hits of issue I know about are this one and the other one against your guy last year. Are there other hits that he's been condemned for in the past?
SkincareAddicts,fdqrdnc,t3_emq6on,1578673243.0,"Did you ask questions and he dismissed them, or did you just feel like he rushed you and you forgot to ask them? He diagnosed your type of acne and prescribed the one thing that's reliable to fix it. If he was after your money he would have dragged out trying other things, through multiple appointments that you'd have to pay for, before finally prescribing it.

For what it's worth, accutane was the ONLY thing that ever worked for me, after years of wasted derm appointments trying other stuff first. I personally never experienced any side effects."

PublicFreakout,fdiznp9,t1_fdhr4ti,1578454751.0,"People tell themselves stories that justify the actions they want to take. I used to work at a cat shelter and people would bring in lost pets so we could check them for a microchip. If they liked the animal they would be *convinced* it was a stray or had been dumped, expecting no microchip to confirm it had no home so they could keep it.

I would always remind people, a stray in horrible condition might have just been lost for a very long time. And that even if you witness someone dumping an animal, that animal might have been stolen and dumped by the thief when they couldn't sell it. You never know the whole story, and the animal could *always* have a loving home that desperately wants it back, no matter what circumstances you find it in."
PublicFreakout,fdiyxub,t1_fdikdds,1578454259.0,"You don't have to register your dog to have the protection of them being your property, it just helps.

Microchips are actually the best protection, especially with purebred dogs or solid color cats that can be difficult for a police officer to identified by a photograph."

aww,fdik323,t1_fdi194l,1578444671.0,I think a lot of it is also that those hidey spots are excellent for ambushing prey. Any time my cat gets in a box he's on high alert to attack anything that comes close.

AnkiVector,fdhfrpo,t1_fdh1uyk,1578421713.0,Ok so I tried it with a little cardboard and as long as he has his area well mapped it doesn't seem to be an issue! I'll stick to the cardboard house for a couple days and see how it goes.
AnkiVector,fdh6yfa,t1_fdh1uyk,1578416714.0,"Ooh like a little house for the charger? That would be adorable. It would probably have to just cover the back though, if it blocked the symbol then vector wouldn't be able to find his charger."
