unpopularopinion,fehs7kh,t3_ep2slk,1579122829.0,Who cares if it 'disrespects the intimacy' of 'the personal moment'. I think it's disrespectful to the strangers you're unloading your shit on to.

todayilearned,fckmx8u,t1_fckm5um,1577728797.0,"Sure. But again that's an issue if semantics and labels. The use of ""artist"" or ""musician"" Your definition of what that means and your arbitrary ideologies surrounding those definition. All I'm saying is that is really no right or wrong. And it's not really a case of paying people to write your music for you, it's more collaborative than that when you look into how the industry works. It's good that such an outlet exists to reward good songwriters who otherwise wouldnt have the requisite traits for stardom"
todayilearned,fckm31n,t1_fcklnu2,1577728289.0,Why not? It takes just as much skill and practice to master. It seems you are getting hung up on labels and semantics
todayilearned,fcklwy2,t1_fckl3ub,1577728185.0,"Let's not get caught up in semantics here, a musician is someone who practices music, we can all agree on that. Songwriters are musicians too and so are producers and so really pop music is just collaborative music making, it doesn't make it any less valid. It's not like robots made it. It's all peoples effort. To say that the singer has to write the song is an irrelevant argument. What about bands? Their singer doesn't always write the song."
todayilearned,fckkfn4,t1_fckk6xr,1577727269.0,Unfortunately this isn't true. The music money machine has a long history. Check out Mowton. Pop just means popular and where there's popularity there's money. Where there's money there will be manipulation.

unpopularopinion,fciodd6,t3_ehbdz8,1577666054.0,"Is this what this sub is about? It feels more like a shower thought. This sub has become very much like ""an opinion you hadn't thought of"" rather than an actual unpopular one. I thought the idea was to give a unique take and a fresh perspective on something we previously didn't agree with but then kinda liked the new angle. This is just, 'ah yeah good point' is there a sub for that?"

AskReddit,fcbtff9,t3_eh0vkj,1577590772.0,"I'm throwing this in as a sort of example: doing scales on a guitar (if using correct fingering) , I think if you do this every day for a year you would end up a half decent guitarist. I have not tested this theory but I think it makes sense in a kind of 80/20 way.
I would like to know more stuff like this"
