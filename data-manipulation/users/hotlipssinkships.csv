If you are military you can have multiple investigations bc family advocacy group, the ship, the command where the ship is docked, and ncis are all involved on the same matter.  I was literally cleared four times and still couldn’t get five mins in court to state so without another charge.  eYou can have more than one jeopardy only in military situations.  It’s even worse when you piss of the host country.  Civilian court is what your thinking of.  You are tried four times if your unlucky.  Would you like pictures of the statements?   I’ll be glad to post them.  You are also welcome to read post history.  I have struggled for years and get nearly 3700 a month for life because of this set of lies.   So I’ll enjoy my joint on the beach not having to be deployed or work again and then cry about how the person I loved lost had an open marriage affair(without my consent) and then tried to charge me with rape after she realized she had signed the kids to me a month prior.  She then made everything he’ll in my life.  Thank you for calling me a liar.  My own mother said the same thing when I told her I was raped multiple times at garden city elementary.  I had to abandon a lot of relationships in my life because of people like you that would rather call me a liar then consider the truth.

Men in the military pledge their life to their country every day.  That they would die for their honor courage and commitment.   The fact men are brainwashed into thinking this is noble just plays into the notion that men are disposable and nothing more than paychecks to women during divorces.  When falsely accused almost every man becomes suicidal due to the isolation caused by commits like this.  Good luck in your life and I wish you the best."

FuckYouKaren,fe81osx,t1_fe7z2mr,1578921427.0,"No she used me becoming suicidally depressed as the reason she had to do the abuse.  She would start three to four investigations and then call local police, my command,  Base legal and everythingn saying I was suicidal to get them to raid my home.  After the 8th time I declared in emails I would rather die than help her because of her lying constantly to make my life hell.  Mind you she had already prevented me from visiting daycares by screaming at me then calling the police because I showed up exactly at the time I told her but the lawyer said I would be there no later than 10.   I was court ordered to pick up my kids from daycare but she told them I had to sit on my car for two hours after driving 14.   I cried.   Men crying is looked down so much, she would then call the police on me again to create more drama.  I warned her if she continued to s this I would walk away.

I cry most nights missing my kids and know that they will be raised to hate me by a person that actually con vienced lawyers that it’s ok to lie in court if she can make her husband suicidal. 

She did after having my home raided 8 times in two or three months from 1200 miles away.  I don’t even bother showing up for trials when she demands them anymore bc the judges just believe her shit and I can’t get five mins to defend my own honor.

The reason McDonald’s labor is cheap bc only one or two people need to know technical and the rest are sadly, drones on auto pilot.   Spending 5k over two years in education that is 3 hours a day and you can work around it is WAY cheaper than college.
