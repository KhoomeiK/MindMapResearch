That's a tactic right wingers use to trick people into believing the left is evil."

Maybe I could've got good if I learned combos but it seemed like so much work, so I just played smash, where I also sucked."

aww,fdi1zxh,t1_fdhzjir,1578434310.0,"Yeah that's also bad, and I won't justify it, but the difference is that men usually aren't afraid of getting assaulted, raped, etc, just by walking down the street like women do. It doesn't need to get to that point, stuff like cat calling, being followed when you're walking, etc do happens, and it makes women really uncomfortable and terrified sometimes, it's not just women getting offended for being objectified or something, these men are in a position of power against them, it's scary for them.

That makes comments like these even more uncomfortable than they would normally be (even online), but I agree it's bad in both cases."

books,fcv1dup,t1_fcu1c7f,1577992636.0,"Yep, sometimes it's fine to force yourself to read a book you find boring or more difficult to read if you really want to learn something, and it's also fine to just give up because it's not worth it.

In my case I was reading a politics/economics book because I wanted to know more about those subjects, I found really interesting what I read but eventually gave up on the book because it was a little technical, there were a lot of concepts I didn't know, and I was reading it too slowly. Eventually it became a chore to read it.

It's fine that I gave up, but probably I will try it again sometime because I value knowledge, even though reading fiction would be more fun to me."

The game at this point is awesome, specially considering it's free, but the new light experience (basically what a new player gets right now) is terrible, the game story mode (campaigns) is really hidden considering how important it is for new players, and there's too much stuff going on, there are the introduction missions, but they're kinda meh. I started with New Light and I've played so much since, but I get why a lot of people would just stop playing."

His ability to take information from a lot of sources and put it in a cohesive and entertaining video is outstanding. Also the way he narrates the story and his voice are amazing too.

He should write books and then make the audiobook version of them."
