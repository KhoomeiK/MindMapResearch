Floribama,fffzeq4,t3_etdlrk,1579895138.0,I can here to say EXACTLY this! I never thought I could be so proud of someone I don’t even know! But seriously good for her. Also agree with others who said they’ve been in similar situations. Hearing him make the “needing their fix” comment made me feel so bad for her. I know he didn’t mean it that way but that was so mean. I can only imagine how I would feel if a guy I used to hook up with and had feelings for said that.
Floribama,fffwf0h,t1_fffugiw,1579893278.0,Also here’s a link to the tweet I’m referring to. https://twitter.com/pimpfriedrice_/status/1220575257779523585?s=21
Floribama,fffvfwa,t1_fffugiw,1579892662.0,"Yeah she signed a NDA... that doesn’t mean she has to outright lie? No need to be rude

ETA: NDA just means she cant say certain things not that she has to go out of her way TO say things"
Floribama,fffu9gt,t1_ffezkwo,1579891924.0,"I agree with a lot of what you said, but Candace herself tweeted today that the show isn’t scripted"
Floribama,ffcxvd7,t1_ff938au,1579809531.0,This was my impression too. It would seem pretty lazy on MTVs part to have the same paid extra appear on the same show in (what I’m assuming) is a relatively short time frame. Kinda seems to me that she just wants to get on TV.
bigboobproblems,ff2tasw,t1_ff1jk8e,1579523265.0,"I was thinking this as well! Out of curiosity I looked at the picture. The fact that someone looked at that picture, picked out your boobs, and sexualized an extremely modest picture is kind of mind-blowing. Sorry you had to experience that!

(On a side note, I think the color on the right picture would look good on you!)"

Oh thank you! I don't know if I can watch this for 10 minutes LOL but I appreciate it!"
Floribama,fexx99s,t1_few6zyf,1579437843.0,Agreed with this as well. Doesn’t seem like she’s matured or learned from her mistakes at all
Floribama,fevxx5p,t1_fevxhow,1579402925.0,"You’re welcome! But yep, agreed."

premed,fevwea4,t1_feuj9x5,1579402279.0,I definitely don’t think PA is an odd option for younger people. I almost find it more odd that you would think people think it’s odd! I know plenty of young people either in PA school or who are practicing PAs.
Floribama,fevvypk,t1_fevvrmo,1579402120.0,"Ohhh, I must have missed this! That makes more sense at least. I thought she was just acting like it never happened. Thank you!"

Floribama,fevm5lu,t1_felibfa,1579398984.0,"This. I was going to say their drinkings is almost tame compared to what I saw in college. Granted, they aren't in college, but they are only a few years older than typical undergrads."
Floribama,fevlqfm,t3_epwvzv,1579398831.0,"Has anyone else noticed that the CC on this show is god awful? I always watch TV with CC on (though granted, I don't watch much TV), and there are a ton of words that are completely incorrect. Is every TV show like this, do they have an awful CC team, or is someone trying to be funny? I really can't tell. I'm going to try to take pictures of some of the funnier ones I notice from now on."
Floribama,fevl4ql,t1_feoz1mf,1579398711.0,"Yep, agreed! I've always heard it called jungle juice."
Floribama,fevj1aw,t1_feuvuhc,1579397995.0,"When did Jeremiah call her the n word? I know she made the comment that she didn't like him but she didn't specifically say he said that, did she?"
dogs,fdij6de,t3_ele34n,1578444100.0,"Agreed with most of the other comments. It sounds like she’s EMOTIONALLY abusing the dog, even if she isn’t physically abusing the poor thing. This is awful. I hope the dog gets out of the situation and you are okay and can move out."
Floribama,fdiiw4e,t1_fdexubg,1578443920.0,"I definitely appreciate the point you’re making, and I don’t want it to seem like I’m defending the floribama crew and saying they’re all perfect, because they’re faiiiir from it and I liked jersey shore way more. I also agree that the jersey shore crew had (or at least had, I stopped watching family vacation because a lot of their behavior really bothered me coughRONcough coughJENNIcough) redeeming qualities. I don’t think this show is at entertaining but I also feel like part of it has to do with these people just being much more low key than JS, or at this point it may just be overplayed. I do remember reading at some point they said we aren’t trying to be the New Jersey shore. 

I saw someone else posted that the JS crew at least had things in common, but other than being from the general south, this group doesn’t really have much in common. And other than nilsa and aimees friendship, none of them really have that super tight bond we saw on JS. 

Finally, I TOTALLY agree I hope this behavior doesn’t become the norm. I just feel like it unfortunately is. People are a lot more concerned with Gus and Jeramiahs yelling fight and the whole bill situation  (probably scary/rude? Yes. Did anything ACTUALLY happen? No) than they are about more serious issues (like the arrests and physical fights you mentioned).

Anyway I’m just rambling at this point haha I think both groups had their flaws but JS redeemed themselves. Right now it doesn’t look like floribama shore will, but hey, maybe they’ll all surprise us."
Floribama,fdexjwo,t1_fdexdom,1578348714.0,"Oh, interesting! I wonder why MTV holds some shows to that standard and not others. Thank you for letting me know! Also, it seems like a lot of people really like the Challenge, I may try to get into it!"
Floribama,fdevlr2,t1_fdevg98,1578347522.0,"Also the stuff with Mike wasn’t covered until afterwards, when he was getting in legal trouble and was starting to accept he had a problem and needed help. While it was happening there was no confirmation of him doing drugs."
Floribama,fdevg98,t3_el0fbu,1578347432.0,"This is kind of irrelevant, but does MTV really fire people for fighting on their other shows? The only other reality show I watch/watched was Jersey Shore and obviously no one was getting fired over there haha. I don’t have anything to base a judgement off of though, so I’m truly curious!"
Floribama,fdev73v,t1_fdetj6m,1578347283.0,"I think people on here are just forgetting a lot of the issues the cast of JS had, which was my point of the “rainbows and sunshine comments”. My comment was also more of a generalization based on what others have said, not just you, so I do apologize if it seems specifically like I was calling you out! I’ve just been thinking about this for awhile. 

Also, I feel like the cast of JS reflected years later. I mean look at Mike and the whole bashing his head against a wall or Jenni and Sam’s little girl fight. That is by far worse than the little screaming matches on floribama shore. I just feel like because JS was in the past and we’re used to it, we don’t think it was as big as a deal as we do seeing Floribama in real time. In a few years, probably no one will even bat an eye at the drama on Floribama that currently has everyone all worked up.

ETA: social media wasn’t as big when Jersey Shore first started getting huge. We didn’t have the cast commentary on a billion different social media platforms live-commenting before like we do now"
Floribama,fdep1kp,t1_fdefcv2,1578343640.0,"I disagree with this. What about when one no one could stand Sam? Or Mike? The JS crew had a TON of issues as well. I feel like I see a lot of people basically saying Jersey Shore was all rainbows and sunshine, and that is just not the case. Not to mention that a lot of people are upset with Jenni and Snooki for bullying Angelina in the most recent season."
Floribama,fd0ffz3,t1_fcx8qq4,1578118037.0,"I was one of the people who said something like that. I never doubted she got her tonsils out, but what I was more confused by was her SUDDENLY needing an emergency tonsillectomy. More than likely it was already scheduled and she was already planning to leave (or her surgery was moved up). They don’t do many emergency tonsillectomy’s. 
On a side note, as someone who used to get chronic tonsillitis and had their tonsils removed at 20, the LAST thing I wanted to do was yell and smoke a cigarette when I was having an active issue. She just didn’t exactly act like she was in a lot of throat pain."
Floribama,fd0b0ch,t1_fcw0q6q,1578116264.0,"Right?! She was SO disinterested in Aimee even being there. Pain meds make you tired and maybe loopy, but I’ve never heard of them making you fixate on your phone. She reminded me of a petulant teenager whose parents made them come to a family gathering."
Floribama,fd09za2,t1_fcze550,1578115826.0,"I think it’s just the way he said it. I’m sure he thinks he’s being nice by saying that, but what the OP is getting at is that he doesn’t view women as equals.

ETA: by “he” I mean Gus. I really don’t think he said it meaning any harm or disrespect, just how he was raised. To him he thinks he’s a gentlemen, but to others it comes off as misogynistic."
dogs,fcxspnr,t3_ej93p4,1578069948.0,"I am so so sorry for your loss, I can not imagine how difficult that must be. As others have said, I hope that you find comfort and positivity that you were able to give her love, affection, and a good home for her last few weeks. Thinking of you and your dog during this difficult time."
jerseyshore,fcvclj2,t1_fcst7kp,1577999278.0,"I didn't even bash Ron... I was asking a question, which you answered. It was not meant to be negative or anything, I just haven't seen anything after the initial uproar it caused. I hadn't been able to find anything the last time I tried to read about it, so thank you for clarifying."
jerseyshore,fcvcfx5,t1_fcstlz6,1577999185.0,"Thank you, that was all I was looking for."
Floribama,fcsomo5,t1_fcoi2s3,1577921209.0,Agreed. Seeing someone like this brought me wayyy too many memories of people I used to know like that. It’s not pleasant at all or funny (to me).
Floribama,fcktbxh,t1_fcjjb4b,1577732743.0,Eh idk that jeramiah freak out seemed pretty real to me
Floribama,fcilul8,t1_fcfb7su,1577664732.0,"Agreed with this! In college I would black out way more than I care to admit. The only time people could ever tell was when I would start to fall asleep. I am also a nice drunk and agree with the statement of being a mean drunk versus a nice one. Some people just become unbearable when they drink or black out, but it definitely is not everyone."

premed,fcd0bp9,t3_egx1ni,1577604789.0,"All jokes aside, the pre-med advisors where I’m taking my post-bac straight up tell people (undergrads and post bac students) not to use SDN or reddit for application info/questions/comparisons/etc. Obviously I don’t listen well, but I definitely see why they come right out of the gate saying that."
Floribama,fccyz6j,t1_fccyax5,1577604332.0,"Yeah, me too. I mean we all know it’s edited to an extent, but I like to believe that they don’t edit it to make things more “convenient” for the crew/MTV. That really bothers me. I’d rather it just all be fake than them twisting something real and minimizing a serious situation."
Floribama,fccxc6z,t1_fcciypg,1577603774.0,"I honestly just took it as Nilsa didn’t want there to be any more drama that day. I didn’t even consider it was overreacting, but I can see how people would think that from the editing. Speaking of, I’m glad you brought up the editing-I thought it was extremely weird and didn’t add up, and now we know it doesn’t. I honestly thought the lines were just dubbed in or something and they just showed a random shot of the crowd."

premed,fc8uq3y,t1_fc8r0e9,1577542294.0,"Agreed with this. I’m taking a MCAT review course now and the instructor thought I was a Biochem major because of the detail I knew. I was like nope, I learned all this in a semester (and only 1 person in a class of nearly 30 got an A)."
premed,fc8tn2g,t1_fc8sn02,1577541762.0,"This! I think it really depends on the speciality and the physician in question. The chief of the hospital I work at NEVER takes vacation. In fact, he just had a month like vacation to another country to see his family planned, but had a cold and didn’t go. He was at work doing surgeries the next day. He easily could have gone on vacation, but I really think he just didn’t want to. I think this applied to pretty much every physician (or any job in general). I know you’re typically extremely busy during residency, but residency doesn’t last forever"
Floribama,fc8sez3,t1_fc7kdde,1577541137.0,"I think he said that like... once. And I’m pretty sure that’s when he was wasted, and I hardly think that’s him trying to act like a gangsta."
