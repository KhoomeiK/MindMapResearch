worldnews,ff33zlm,t1_ff2pc7r,1579533092.0,"I'm not an economist, by any means. But if the wealthy use their money to found new businesses, that could be great. The issue is that a company is more or less designed to maximize profits for shareholders right now.

A company growing is great! It would also be great if the bottom end of the company felt the perks of growth. The difference is that they'll do anything to maximize shareholder profits - and it's a pretty common occurrence for employees to be cut down for those profits. Whether it's cutting pension plans, reducing benefits, having a low pay cap, forcing irregular shifts so people have a hard time organizing second jobs / education, reducing hours / number of jobs but keeping work the same, etc.

The disconnect seems to happen at where the profits go. Low end employees haven't been paid at a rate to keep up with cost of living. Despite increasing productivity on a global level, some places haven't actually increased wages almost at all. And the system encourages this (at least in the US)! Because if a company cuts into their profits to pay better wages /have better benefits, their competitors can undercut them using (figurative or literal depending upon location) slave labor. This hurts their profits further, and makes it harder for them to treat their employees well.

Plus you have the whole shareholder thing. An investor doesn't necessarily care how well people are treated - they just want their money to grow. If you could open a savings account at a very kind institution that pays their people well but has the lowest interest versus a place that treated people terribly but that can give you 50% interest in two years, you'll take the latter almost always regardless of morality.

gaming,fc6jwq6,t1_fc6fjhu,1577482336.0,"There are what, two potions that heal? Meat out of combat, potions in combat. Bread and stuff too, just play a couple rounds of gwent with the inkeep to buy everything he owns that's cheap and heals (as well as white gull and the cordial, for alchemy). Also, decoctions are awesome. There's one that gives you 20 extra carry weight, just use it to get around once you're over encumbered. Or use roach, since he's a demon horse that can carry everything. 

For crafting, just go to that first when selling to make sure you're not selling something made with diamond dust for 200 when the dust alone costs almost that much. Keep a small gold reserve for missions where that's required (like the gwent tournament costing 1k), but if it's not too annoying focus on crafting for higher tier items. Like, I sell things when they're around 900 rather than break down because it's a nice way to pay for the breakdown of everything else.

If you're like me and inpatient with crafting sometimes, don't sweat it, save your material for when you're getting a full set of witcher gear and just loot or sell whatever else. I'm sign focused, so high level gear doesn't do much for me since I just quen spam and eventually kill whatever I'm fighting, so long as they're not ten levels above me. 

Also, breaking down the small stuff is cheap and opens up room in your inventory. One high value item can pay for breaking down all the goblets and stuff that you definitely didn't steal from starving peasants.

Remember to do races. They give you bigger saddlebags. More carrying capacity. No combat, so as long as you can survive getting to them, level is irrelevant.

And quen. Higher level skill can heal you when hit instead of just shielding, saving tons of potions in drawn out fights.

politics,fc6b1no,t1_fc5m4u0,1577476403.0,"Where are these unions that push for that and why didn't mine? I worked in an unskilled labor union and we were the lowest paid in the industry. I was management at the time, capped out in pay, and I still didn't hit $17, neither did the manager above me. Only one made that much, and they were technically skilled labor.

And to clarify, I was there during a contract renegotiation. We went up less than a dollar across the board (except entry level, but that was due more to a minimum wage increase than contract negotiation). We lost two holidays being paid, and a bunch of other little things that were either neutral or bad. Restructuring seniority and time off requests is the kinda thing I'd call neutral. 

I'm not trying to get super specific, but we were also customer service. Not sitting around ""watching things get made."" hell, they had a system to time the speeds of an efficient worker doing each job and set our hours accordingly.

Sidenote, a lot of the people who have to watch things get made are required to be able to fix said machinery when it goes down. It's kinda like how you'll see several people standing next to road construction and two working - there's a reason for it. Whether it be that they have to wait to do their job for someone, or that one is a manager organizing and the other is the legally required safety supervisor correcting an employee who didn't shore up a hole in the road.

Lowest pay in the industry, fewer paid holidays, open on Christmas and Thanksgiving. The non union stores were the opposite.

Add in that they took $50 a month from our checks, rarely actually intervened when the workers needed it, and had a useless contract negotiation a few years ago (pay went up less than a dollar, started and ended lower than competitors), only enforce the rules at the detriment of the workers (no crossing contracts for extra hours, but turns a blind eye to less hours than is required by the union).

Unions can be great. But some of them are just people taking advantage of workers from a different angle. It's easy to be bitter about them when you got screwed by the company and the union. Not the kinda DP I like."
politics,fc68kbu,t1_fc62ofa,1577474753.0,"So this seems relevant to something I've been wondering. I worked for a company that had a patent on our product. We sold to a company that I'm gonna call sheds are tough. We bought material from China. According to my friend (who was top manager below the office people and owner), it costs 4x to buy local, in state. Double if we had to expedite (cuz the owner procrastinated). If he tried to raise his prices, our customer threatened to send our product to China, have it reverse engineered, and buy it from them for cheaper. So we couldn't raise prices, and the business couldn't grow. This hurt the employees mostly, who had increased production but no higher pay. We had a skilled aluminum welder making barely $20/hour.

The reason I explained all this is I'm wondering where the fault is. Support local business, get undercut / lose profits, be forced to pay less to employees. Buy from China, undercut other small businesses, support sweatshops, increased environmental damage from giant freighters carrying material, etc.

I've been wondering why there isn't a subsidy encouraging local trade rather than international (or at least heavy tariffs), so that our businesses prop each other up at the same time they compete. Wouldn't it be better if people bought locally to help businesses grow so they can employ more people and pay them better and create a cycle of prosperity?
