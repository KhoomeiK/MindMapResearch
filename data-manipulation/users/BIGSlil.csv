This is why sociopaths thrive in high level corporate positions. I'm sure that morals influence decisions, even if only subconsciously, for anyone that isn't a sociopath."
Competitiveoverwatch,ff8apov,t1_ff86gnt,1579671121.0,">Hanzo storm arrows couldnt headshot and had slightly more delay between shots.

I actually really like that idea. He would still be a great hero, but it would limit his ability to melt tanks. I think storm arrow's main use is, or at least should be, melting shields anyway. 

>Maybe a sort of ""tempo"" field that increases fire rate for people in its area?

That actually sounds really cool and I would be all for it. That alone would probably make him viable. It might break him at high level play though.

>I wouldnt mind a buff to his ult involving sprint though, allowing him to still fire with his ult while sprinting

That gives me flashbacks to the crab walk in Gears Of War 1, a glitch where you could shoot while moving at sprint speed, maybe even faster. I do like that change too though. His ult is pretty much useless at high levels, at low levels it can have some impact at least. Another idea would be to buff his sprint, or just movement speed altogether, during his ult making him more like a super soldier."
Competitiveoverwatch,ff7euns,t1_ff7c79r,1579647924.0,"Those are all valid points, but I was talking more about at the top level of play in the current meta. Even outside of the current meta, at the top level of play, burst damage is way better than sustained. Even though his helix rocket is high burst, snipers are still higher like you said. Hanzo can do almost everything soldier can, just better. Sure he has no heals, but at the top level that shouldn't matter as much as the other differences. At lower levels, and even higher ladder play, I'm pretty sure soldier is a viable pick. If we do get hero bans, I wonder if he'll be played in OWL at all or if there are still better picks no matter what."
Competitiveoverwatch,ff772oh,t1_ff769ej,1579642405.0,"That makes sense. I would alsoassume people are slower to report in GM since you expect widows to hit shots. On a side note, why did I get downvoted for that question?"

Hopeful Blizzard counts reports from stacks differently. I also don't know what happens when you get banned for being toxic, I think it's a mute and loss of endorsement, but maybe there's worse consequences. Also, they could just report for cheating if they want."

todayilearned,feuafjv,t1_feu1b2x,1579384687.0,That's different. It serves the purpose of helping you find your car. Beeping to make sure it's locked is only because they're too lazy to just check by pulling on the door.
