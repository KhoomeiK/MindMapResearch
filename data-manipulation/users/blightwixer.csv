latterdaysaints,ff9e5dc,t3_esd29r,1579711055.0,Thank you for sharing. It's always amazing to hear these stories. Stay strong my friend.
lds,fejx9gu,t3_epanxx,1579187948.0,"I am only a little into this book but so far it has me excited for the rest, and for the other project Don is working on. I highly recommend this book."
lds,fei4ahu,t1_fei32qh,1579129966.0,"I actually filled out the volunteer form a while back and eventually heard from somone who said they would contact my bishop and get back to me. That was a few months ago though so I am not sure where things are at now. Maybe it was just because of the holidays and because my bishop can be hard to get ahold of. I will try to be patient and wait to hear back.

I would love to hear about how you got involved with this work if you are ever interested in sharing."
lds,fei26bv,t3_ep77he,1579128644.0,"Thank you for posting this. I am so grateful for these resources because they have helped me to learn and grow in ways I never thought possible. I have to question my preconceived ideas at time and rebuild the narrative I believed in, but it all has lead to greater and stro ger faith. 

I just wish I could get my family (mostly my in-laws) to not be so scared of these resources. They seem so worried about me for using these them. 

On a side note, I have felt for a long time that I needed to be actively involved in this type of work but I have no idea where to start. If anyone on here has connections with these organizations, I would love to hear from you about how you got involved."
lds,fe5izqx,t3_enu03j,1578870091.0,"Never forget there is always hope. Many have left and many end up returning. The best you can do is continue to love. The worst you can do is shun (though you may need to be careful if she is hurting your testimony). Most of all, remember that God is far more crushed than you are. This is his child. He will continue to do everything he can to bring her back. Ask for comfort. It will come with time. 

I know this is hard, trust me I have been there, but never let this hurt your faith. That is my problem. I let these types of things get to me too much and it brings me down. The Atonement can help you and your roomate. Never forget that. Pray for her. The gospel is true."
latterdaysaints,fdgwroh,t3_el6s9v,1578410242.0,"I know how difficult this can be. Especially when you have reddit pushing back against you (personally, I had to leave reddit for a while because of this. I wanted to make my own decisions without all these opinions). 

It is amazing to me that almost every time somone goes to make a step in the church (baptism, temple, marriage) there seems to be a lot of adversity. For me, it took a lot of effort to push through these chalanges but on the other side there was peace and joy. I suggest you pray, a lot, ask for guidence. At times I wasn't sure there was a God. And I wasn't sure the church was true. But I kept praying. It took me years to reach the point I am at now so please don't give up. 


There is an intresting website that is devoted to this topic. This is run by a group of members and it is not an official church website, but it has some good resources. It might be worth looking into.

Blacklds.org

 If you love near Utah, I would also encourage you to look into the lds genesis group 
http://www.ldsgenesisgroup.org/

There are some good members there who might be well suited to help answer your questions. 



I hope something I have said helps. I know this is hard. I know the pain that come with struggling with these issues. Don't give up. Trun to the lord. It may take some time but if you are willing to work he will help. Be humble and willing to do whatever God asks. There is hope on the other side of this."

lds,fd9iafh,t1_fd5ovys,1578233711.0,"There are a lot at Idaho State. Every semester a few of my students bring up their mission (or if they are trying to be criptic, they talk about serving people for a couple years), we also usually ask about religious affilation in our studies and we tend to get a lot of lds responses."
MicrosoftRewards,fcwoufe,t1_fcwo84u,1578031992.0,Same here. And there are times when I have gotten one late at night and it has worked for me both that night and the next morning (on the same acheevement). I wish I knew what caused this.

Between graduate school, spending time with my wife, our 1 year old, and my work, it's hard to make time for. The biggest issue as well is that I have forgotten so much about reading music and so it is hard to start again."
AskReddit,fcwo306,t1_fcwmvui,1578031253.0,"Me at the beginning of a new year: ""I should get my piano out of storage and set it up and schedule time each week to practice again."" 

My wife a few months later: ""you haven't touched that thing in months, can we please put it back in storage?"" 

Me at the beginning of the following year: ""I should get my piano out of storage and set it up and schedule time each week to practice again."" 

Maybe it will finally work this time."
MicrosoftRewards,fcwgei0,t1_fcvg6hf,1578024950.0,Same here. It took me weeks to figure this out.
psychologystudents,fcwezra,t1_fcvq6wx,1578023929.0,"Is really sad that psychologist violate these rules far too often. As an expermental psychologist, I do think there is a lot of great solid research, but too often the above rules are violated, and then many of these violations are not even mentioned in a limitations section.  It's far too easy too hide crapy research behind fancy looking stats that most people won't understand."
AskReddit,fcwb5qn,t3_ej3pte,1578021344.0,"As a psychologist there are a few that drive me crazy.

#1 we only use 10% of our brain (if that was true, you would be dead. EDIT: I noticed after posting this that somone else already said this)

gaming,fcreo04,t3_eiir7g,1577900813.0,Can't believe I didn't notice this.
psychology,fcofh06,t1_fcoax2o,1577830963.0,"There is definitely some emperical support for what you are saying. Work on the fundamental atrubution error shows how we tend to focus on surface level dispositions for others when making behavioral atrobutions while often neglecting situational factors that may interact with their deeper level aspects.

Additionally, the self other knowledge asymmetry (SOKA) model demonstrates how, like you say, there are aspects of ourselves that we are more acutely aware of than others. The opposite is also true, there are aspects of others that we can judge more accurately than they can. In line with what you said, this may be why we often think we are so different from others and yet make judgments of them that are simular to ourselves. 

*on a side note, I hate the term fundamental atrobution error because it is not really an error. It's more of a bias. People are often not wrong when they make these dispositional judgments, but they are biased against any situational factors that may be at play."
psychology,fco3dtk,t3_ei348l,1577823317.0,"Empathic accuracy is highly related to my own research area. I study personality judgment accuracy and it always amazes me how most people claim they are not like others, and that they don't rate others as simular to themselves, but I have never seen a sample of people who do not engage in projection to some degree. In our research we always have to statistically seperate simmularity or projection ratings (know in my feild as normative accuracy) from unique or distinctive ratings. Interestingly, current research suggests that being empathetic dosent really help people make more accurate judgments (this area needs more research though)."

AcademicPsychology,fc97cuf,t1_fc7bo9k,1577548198.0,"I did go streight into a grad program. I probably did not prepare as much as I should have. I only lightly read the research from the different labs I applied to (I should have read more). One thing that really helped me was that I was lucky enough to be on a project my junior year that was published just before I applied. This helped me to be a little more competitive going into my program. Other then that, I just tried to read a lot in order to prepare. My suggestion is try to find something you are passionate about and look for people studying simular topics. You will do far better and enjoy grad school far more if you are doing research that interests you."

There may be somone on here who is clinical and would know more than me but I will give you my opinion incase it helps. My department has Ph.D programs for both clinical and experimental psychology. Grad students are able to have a mentor from either the clinical or experimental side and I often see clinical students mentored by faculty who specialize in social psychology research. These students get a clinical degree but they end up with a number of publications in social psychology related journals. Some of them end up doing exactly what you say you want to do, that is, they go on to teach and still do clinical work for their departments or at various outside practices. It might be worth looking into a program like that."
AcademicPsychology,fc5ocwb,t3_egcnw6,1577462585.0,Is there a reason you want a Ph.D in social psychology over clinical psychology? There are many clinical programs where you can find a mentor who does social psychology research. What is your ultimate goal?
