Blacks were forced to buy near industrial areas because they couldn’t get into the nicer neighborhoods. 

Grandma still lives in the home, which is now worth well over a million dollars. They originally paid 21k for it. When she dies, my mom will inherit a decent chunk of change from the sale of the house. And I will likely inherit some of that one day. 

I hate the whole “white privilege” thing and I think it gets twisted. But this is one example that sort of made it real to me. It’s no fault of my own, but discrimination back in the 50s benefited my grandparents, which ultimately benefited me."

He told me to head to my local CalFire department and have them issue me a burn permit with my current address. That would suffice.
