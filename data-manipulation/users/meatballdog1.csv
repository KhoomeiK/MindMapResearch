iguanas,ffgwwna,t1_ffgvjph,1579917140.0,"The infection started as a scar that I thought was something. I took her to the vet and they recommended a foot cream. I used it and it seemed to burn her - at the time I thought it was the infection getting worse. We saw a new vet - and we sent off biopsies. It came back as fungal and she gave me silver cream for burns and anti fungals and antibiotics. NOTHING made it better, it was getting worse. So we cancelled treatment and it improved, it now looks like it might come off in a few sheds, but otherwise just isn’t changing. The vet told me we had exhausted all options short of amputation- and her foot still works and she uses it without issue so I wasn’t ready for that. 

We removed all substrate and use puppy pads to keep clean now. 

What do you mean beta soak? 

As far as temperature, I admit I really have dropped the ball and don’t know as of lately. On my way home from work I’ll buy a new heat gun. That’s my bad being lazy. 

I’ll try to do the picture later."
iguanas,ffguuce,t1_ffgue81,1579915636.0,"I think it may be cold - my house doesn’t retain heat - her enclosure isn’t really THAT small - just climbing is limited. She has a 100w CHE and 100W MVB bulb both pointed at her basking spot. 

She DID have this crazy foot infection that the vet gave up on and only gets worse with treatment. It is NOT yellow fungus and doesn’t seem to otherwise affect her, aside from being ugly. It is seemingly on the mend but has been there for 2 years now. 

I don’t know what to do. No parasites. Fecals are clean. I don’t want her to die but she is miserable looking and I feel awful."
houseplants,fffuoky,t1_fffra9g,1579892186.0,Oh good! I know some plants only flower when they die... this is my first plant to flower!
houseplants,fffr8ip,t1_fffp9tg,1579890053.0,It doesn’t mean it’s dying though right?!
dogs,ffazdwo,t1_ffay8xa,1579748022.0,"That makes sense. I don’t think my area is overpopulated though. Everyone in Colorado wants a dog to go with their Subaru. One of my local shelters usually only has 5 dogs or so. 

I just think region to region shelter populations and diversity varies a lot. My nearest shelter does have a lot of pit bulls - many of which have been there for more than a few months. But - that’s not to say they don’t get many other breeds in. Again, must be a regional thing because today when I looked they had ~4 BC mix puppies too."
dogs,ff9x4s7,t1_ff9elh6,1579723419.0,"I know it IS an issue, I don’t mean to minimize that - but the severity of it definitely varies. Re: your experience: That’s crazy! I’m sorry it’s so hard to find them. Here we get them from New Mexico. My husky mix was at our shelter for a month. He has some reactivity issues - and his story I think scared most away from him. He was loose at the same time as 3 big dogs that killed a small dog. So he got that label even though there was not ever and hasn’t been any indication or evidence that he had anything to do with it. 

Now, I didn’t mean to recommend that husky mix to anyone. He’s a great dog but he pulls me on my bike for 4 miles and is still ready to go. The energy level is insane. He needed a working home. Not something I would’ve even recommended to myself had I known the severity of his lack of socialization and training prior. 

His issues are almost non existent now. He’s much better on leash - he is more so a working dog with me anyways. We jor and do dog sports, but he’s currently at daycare with other dogs, we’ve done socialization at the shelter and he passed with flying colors to be approved for play group. His worst trait is he ate my couch when left alone and cries when crated. 

But I see the BC/Heeler mixes here ALL the time. Keep your eye on Colorado if you’re ever looking again.

Edit to add: I do have husky experience- that’s always been my breed of choice since we do dog sports. Otherwise he wouldn’t have come home with me. I do understand what you mean about shelter/problem huskies and people who aren’t prepared for them."
dogs,ff912gf,t1_ff7yfpt,1579702166.0,"I’m inclined to mostly agree with point #1 - BUT this is totally region specific. 

Where I’m located (CO) there are always collie mixes in shelters. Both of mine came from shelters/humane societies. Calling them sane might be a stretch, but they’re not monster dogs either. One was a puppy - and we see collie/ACD mix puppies like her all the time in our shelters. The other is a border collie/husky who really isn’t sane, but he isn’t terrible either, he just needs socialization and to learn leash manners. And there are so many more like my two in almost all of our shelters. They go quick, but that doesn’t mean they’re not adoptable."

iguanas,ff5zsk4,t3_erpavk,1579615403.0,Look under (and inside) furniture like couches and recliners. Look on top of curtain rods and shower curtains. Cabinets etc. mine used to be quite the escape artist and I usually found her on top of the blinds - but now she eagerly goes under or inside of furniture.
dogs,ff3i8v5,t1_ff3flo6,1579541602.0,Such a good feeling!! I’m so glad for you. We had a moment like that yesterday with my reactive dog.
endometriosis,ff21i6c,t3_er4682,1579491275.0,"I’m sorry you’re suffering and I’m sorry the wait is so long. :( 

I see him as well - and I know that a lot of women from across the state/out of state will get a hotel for the days surrounding their surgery and save the drive for when they’re feeling a bit better. Is that an option? I know that doesn’t make it happen any sooner, but to give you some relief about your move?"
Anticonsumption,ff199en,t1_feyckng,1579476452.0,You can get stickers to go over the emblem off Etsy. Definitely recommend that over removing it - it’s a part of the grill itself.
dogs,ff15ddi,t3_er09c4,1579475392.0,"Bad behaviors acquired in a shelter or pre shelter can usually be fixed. Even at an older age. I adopted a 2y/o husky/border collie from the shelter and he was reactive on leash, to the point that I couldn’t walk him about a month into our ownership. He would see another dog, and gentle leader or no, knock me over to attack it. 

5-6mo in and after constant work and exercise and a class and he’s almost perfect. We don’t greet dogs on leash because of his past, but he doesn’t react anymore. 


All this anecdote to say: if you’re willing to give him some effort, I say go for it."

houseplants,fepi3kn,t1_fephmba,1579321071.0,Repotted it a little while back - didn’t notice anything? Maybe I’ll take it to the local diagnostic place on Sunday. :(
houseplants,feoych4,t1_felgx7f,1579308048.0,I soaked it really well - and it’s gotten worse.
houseplants,felonmx,t1_felgx7f,1579227198.0,But even this one? Western sword ferns are supposed to be drought resistant... I’ll soak him tonight & add a pebble tray to the table he’s on.
houseplants,felfuap,t3_epsgdx,1579221182.0,"More info: I thought I was over watering - so I stopped for awhile. Fronds started looking better, then back to the wilting soft thing. This plant has sentimental value so I’m invested in giving it the best possible care. 


Plant originated in WA state - so I know it likes water. I potted it in a mix of its original dirt/bark/peat moss & added some bark and peat moss with a tiny bit of potting soil. Soil is dry to the touch currently. Should I just give him a good soak? There has been a lot of new growth since September when I brought him home. (About 6 fronds)"
iguanas,fekx6zr,t1_fekwz9f,1579209458.0,"Wow! Very cool. I don’t think mine has ever gotten past 5lbs. Even when she wasn’t terribly thin. I definitely feel that she needs better care - but I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I got her when I was 14 and well, that just shouldn’t have happened. And then she got some crazy fungal infection on her foot, which I’m sure is contributing to her thinness."
iguanas,fekul5h,t3_epopho,1579207913.0,"Wow! I can’t say anything either way about them going gravid - but I’m starting to feel like a bad iguana owner. The size of your female is impressive! 


My 8 y/o female is ~4’ long and maybe 3lbs? I know she’s skinny - I can’t seem to fatten her up and fecals are always clean. I’ll have to make a post myself later I think."
houseplants,feijniq,t1_feiieag,1579140069.0,SUPER helpful! Thanks! I’ll check my cuttings tonight.

houseplants,feiaftt,t1_feiabho,1579133915.0,Dumb question. Where are the nodes? They’re not as pronounced as pothos.
houseplants,fei9i8g,t3_ep9xog,1579133298.0,How do you get it to water prop? I haven’t been able to do it successfully yet. I’m currently just trying rooting hormone in soil :/
dogs,fehotr6,t1_fehos9l,1579120890.0,"They don’t seem to last long enough :/ 

A cover might be good."
dogs,fehojqx,t1_fehnuvc,1579120729.0,That’s an idea - I could try that.
dogs,fehn451,t1_fehje01,1579119902.0,"He gets treats - meals we do in the kitchen. He won’t go in without a command...

I’ll try feeding him in the crate, he used to have a bowl on the door of the crate but he ate that too.... 

Another thing is that once he’s in the crate - we can’t be in the room or he flips out."
Endo,fedv84g,t1_fedi910,1579020605.0,"Definitely, if it’s a cyst, I hope it resolves quickly for you. Mine isn’t seeming to go away- but I swear when I read your post I thought “shit did I write that?”"
