bassoon,ff874ib,t3_es5olw,1579667889.0,"What they all said,  and PRACTICE!  You will learn a ton just by repetition.  You'll learn the feel of the reed for different notes, proper air support, tone and intonation, etc, etc.  You'll learn more from listening and correcting yourself than you will from any teacher.  Which is not to say you shouldn't get a teacher to guide you.  Their guidance is critical, along with your own practice."

bassoon,fetlaab,t3_eq6goh,1579376516.0,"You can test for leaking.  Start with the crook and seal the nipple and butt end.  Suck in on the reed end. You should feel a vacuum.  It should ""pop"" when you remove your mouth.  Next test the wing joint.  Put your fingers over all the tone holes and make sure you're not opening any keys.  Lick the palm of your hand and place the larger end over your palm, making a seal.  Suck into the smaller end, and again, you should feel a vacuum and ""pop"" when you remove your mouth.  Testing the boot is harder, but can be done.  Put your right hand over all the tone holes and close the pancake key.  Place the larger end against your cheek and suck in through the smaller hole, where you would place the wing joint.  Again, you should feel a vacuum and ""pop"" when you remove your mouth.  If you don't feel suction with all of these, you have a leak that likely needs repair from a bassoon repairman.  I hope this makes sense.  It's a lot easier to watch someone do it, and then copy, rather than read about it.  You might be able to find a demonstration on YouTube."

bassoon,fe5wpwy,t1_fe5mhql,1578876647.0,"It's going from half hole to fully covered, not the other way around.  Doing what I suggested works very well in this passage, even playing the second G with the first finger left hand totally uncovered, then third fully covered.  I've played professionally and taught for a number of years, but you do what works for you."
bassoon,fe5l9ex,t1_fe5kf8y,1578870912.0,How do you do the G?  Sometimes I just slide up from the half hole. Depends on the reed.
bassoon,fe51s2p,t3_ensv0k,1578864912.0,"Have you tried physical therapy?  Also, TMJ issues are often related to poor posture and tension."
bassoon,fe4v6f7,t3_enstfz,1578863106.0,"For the E octave slurs, you need to relax your embouchure for the low E, and have a reed that doesn't close up in the lower octave.  For the A slurs, flick the A key for the upper A note for a smooth slur.  For the G slurs, after you've played the middle G, lift your left hand first finger and put it down again (without half hole) for the low G.  For the C slurs, your need to flick the high C key to make the upper C slur.  This looks like ti might be for District auditions, or AllState  They typically choose from Weissenborn, and often this is the one chosen.  Good luck!"

classicalmusic,fdcvdf1,t3_ekft1o,1578285390.0,"I think this is common with musicians, and I think the reason is that when we are practicing, we are striving for perfection. So we are constantly fostering perfectionism.  Exercising helps, because it also relieves stress.  I like to raise plants, too, as I find that relaxing.  And my cat helps with stress relief, too, as it's hard to be stressed with a purring cat in your lap."

worldpolitics,fcri73y,t1_fcrhbls,1577902145.0,So that would raise taxes on the middle class.  So the cut off rate would have to higher than middle class.  And we're right back to our starting point.
worldpolitics,fcrgov0,t1_fcrf0l8,1577901593.0,"Currently the highest tax rate is 37%.  The highest tax rate in 1960 was 91%, and 1965 was 70%.  There have been multiple, multiple tax cuts for the wealthy over the decades since then, to where we are now.  Making America Great Again, if actually was implemented, would significantly raise taxes on the wealthy (which, of course, Trump does not support). The disparity between rich and poor has gotten significantly greater over the years.  So a flat tax would be another significant tax cut to the wealthy."
worldpolitics,fcrekbg,t1_fcr98ru,1577900774.0,"It seems counterintuitive, but a flat tax would increase taxes on the poor, and lower taxes on the wealthy.  Many poorer people pay little, or much a lower rate than 27.5%."
