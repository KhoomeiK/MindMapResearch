He was more interested in the arts than ruling and built huge palaces to live in digging deep into the treasury. He also built a 100ft tall statue of himself which I could imagine not going over well with the public. The Colosseum was actually built over one of his palaces after his death, a symbolic way to give something back to the people I'm assuming. Not sure how much truth is in his persecution of Christians but I've read he displayed brutality in thier treatment. In the end the public seen him as an embarrassment  and I think they blamed him for the fire which was the final straw or excuse to get rid of him. Hard to really tell if he was a good man or not but he was someone who had an agenda to pursue personal interests and should have never ruled. Which could be said about a few emperors."
