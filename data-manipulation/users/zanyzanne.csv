socialism,ffgh0rc,t1_ffg02q0,1579906040.0,"This particular example in OP is perhaps in poor taste. However, I believe fomenting unrest is absolutely praxis. Otherwise we're left only harnessing the existing unrest which is clearly not enough to tip the scales toward revolutionary action on the massive scale needed to make it successful. We don't need incremental unrest *caused* by the establishment just as much as we don't need incremental change to *destroy* the establishment.  
I think property destruction in an educational way has a place in praxis as well, even though I wish it was better executed than what we see in OP. I'm sure if this was a beautiful artsy tag we would all be oohing and ahhhing."
