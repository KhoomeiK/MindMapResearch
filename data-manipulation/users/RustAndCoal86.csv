socialanxiety,ffonhz8,t3_eu8648,1580079565.0,"Yea, I know how you feel. I look back on my life and can pinpoint so many times that I made up an excuse or avoided an invite or social situation because I just wanted to go into my apartment, my little zone, and find some kind of entertainment to do on my own and relax. It made sense to me. It’s safe and comfortable. I don’t have to worry about being awkward or how I come off. 

I’ll say this: do what makes you happy. But sometimes if that initial instinct is based on a comfortable routine, it’s really not going to make you happy in the long run

I’m in my 30’s now. And I’m in a routine, or you could call it a rut. Where I live, all the people I know my age are settled down, busy with with families and careers. My few close friends that I gained over my teens and 20’s all live several states away with careers and families.

I feel so behind my peers in terms of social skills, but also dating, relationships, hobbies, kids, careers. And I want those things. I would kill for the opportunity to have parties to go to, trips to go on, to be around and meet good looking women, fun things to look forward to. Like I said, I struggle with the socializing and confidence, having cool interests and hobbies, to make those things happen. To meet new people. I have the desire to get out the door, I just don’t really know what to do when I get out there.

So I look back on high school and college, when I and my peers were all in the same boat. Genuinely, I wish I could go back to then and seize more opportunities, work on those things, get out the door. Any time I said “Yes” to an opportunity, or made my own opportunity (asking a girl to dinner or calling a friend to make plans), however it worked out or uncomfortable I got, I don’t regret it at all. Because these are memories I have, things that I learned from, developing my social skills. I don’t remember or care a damn thing about the thousands of nights I spent watching a TV show or playing a video game

They say “Use it or lose it” and that’s true. When you stay in your comfort zone, your social skills and experience stagnate. So when the opportunity comes to make friends or go to a party, you feel even less prepared, feel like you don’t have anything to talk about or tell someone about yourself

I feel like if you struggle with SA, you’re better off to just get out there and make it happen anyways, and you learn that embarrassment, rejection, failure, social mistakes, they don’t matter at all. You got one life. 

Particularly the younger folks who do want those things, a relationship and friends and a fulfilling life. Just keep on trying. Because the more you choose the easy route, the harder it gets as you age to get out of that routine, and the more you might look back and wish you had those opportunities again"
Watchmen,ff53xby,t3_erncn9,1579579545.0,"Remind me, where did this specific Rorschach emblem appear in the comic?"
Watchmen,ff50du7,t3_erngro,1579576865.0,"Yea, it’s kinda a shame they wanted to close out the story with Episode 9. There’s so much to explore in that world, and those characters. The finale felt like it closed the stories off pretty abruptly."
Watchmen,ff4y684,t3_erm8bh,1579575281.0,"Watchmen, as told by an Incel:

Manhattan is the ultimate alpha gigaChad. He can grow as tall as he wants and control his structure to have a sharp well defined jawline. So he can mog anybody and no man can mog him. In the entire universe, he is truly the Alpha Male Of the Group 

He is being cucked by beta male, Dan Dreiberg. But Chad always wins because it is actually a reverse double cuck. After Laurie hit the wall (aged out, past prime, which is around 16, according to Incels), she used to be a Stacey but now is a roastie, and Manhattan lost all interest, so she went after beta orbiter Dan because he SIMPs for her and listens to her problems. But while Dan is betabuxxing and sleeping with her, she is simultaneously being banged by multiple Chadhattans

OzyMANdias is the ultimate ideal of the MGTOW movement. He represents all the great accomplishments and achievement of human perfection they can obtain, as men who have no use for women, if they ever decide to stop bitching about women online and actually Go Their Own Way.

Rorschach is the turbo truecel, the highest (or lowest) form of Incel. Never takes a shower or changes clothes. Has serious sexual and women issues, misogynistic views, calls them all whores and prostitutes, excuses rape as a moral lapse. He is 5’5” which fits the Incel definition of a ‘manlet’ (anything under 5’10 it seems). He spends all his time writing angry posts about all the whores and libtards, dead animals he’s messing with, and power fantasies about how society is going to pay and beg him to save them all, posted on

Watchmen,fe6icmz,t1_fe6b1wg,1578891825.0,"Yea, probably mine too. The way it ended as well. Had me real hype, but I’m kinda bummed they spoiled it in the preview (showing all the dead 7K in his bunker) and then he didn’t do much at all in the finale. I was expecting him to do something awesome lol. I wish they extended the season by 3 episodes and used the character of LG and the Oklahoma setting add a bit of modern western vibe (ala Breaking Bad or No Country For Old Men)

But yea, that was a great character. Didn’t know what to expect going into this show, was worried I’d see the new characters and just feel like “Yea, okay, so where’s Dr Manhattan? Are we getting a Rorschach flashback?” 

But they managed to come up with some really good, clever characters and personas. Particularly LG. I like how he named himself for the Alice In Wonderland book. The White Rabbit with his pocket watch ticking down. Alice following him further down the rabbit hole (which is a term of alt right conspiracy theorists). And Wonderland is an alternate dimension, which is his great fear. Makes you feel like the character put a lot of thought into his alter ego"
socialanxiety,fe6gzir,t3_enngv6,1578890608.0,"I actually hate being on the receiving end of this. When someone thinks something is really funny, like “You’ve gotta see this!” And they’re watching my reaction. I feel like I have to force a laugh. It’s the worst when it’s something I normally wouldn’t find funny, makes me feel like I’m being fake. But I usually don’t genuinely laugh out loud unless I’m hanging out with friends (which is kinda weird, I guess). Like, I’ll see and appreciate the humor in things. if I’m by myself, watching TV, and I see something I think is hilarious on a favorite show, I’ll probably still just watch it with a straight face (lol yea that is kinda weird). Maybe once or twice in my life have I ever seen anything on the Internet, meme or post, that made me literally lol. But I do see all kinds of things that I think are funny. 

So maybe that person still appreciated the humor in what you showed them, they just feel obligated to express it with a roaring laugh"
socialanxiety,fe6fxxk,t1_fe5twsg,1578889709.0,"I think you nailed it. I think she was just making a dumb joke because everyone was drinking and she felt awkward, as the host, that she couldn’t offer you anything. Thought that a light joke would make you comfortable but misread the situation.  

Something we can all remember is that everybody else is just trying to make it and navigate these social functions as well. But if you pay attention at work parties or family get togethers, most people feel awkward and obligated to say something, either make a joke or “Hey, hows it going?” And then they stand around awkwardly watching the other people in the room while they try to think of something else to say. She was just looking for something to say, caught off guard because she was expecting to just offer adult beverages to everybody 

Sometimes it can feel like everyone else has socializing all figured out and we are the outsiders, so dumb little jokes like this that could happen to anybody, can feel like a jab with everyone’s eyes on you, as if singling you out. But that’s not how it’s meant, and they don’t have it all figured out, and most everyone socially screws up and feels awkward."
socialanxiety,fe6dozm,t1_fe64au6,1578887877.0,You are missed. They are just respecting that they feel you wanna be left alone
socialanxiety,fe6dgh8,t3_enx0mp,1578887689.0,">if they wanted me with them I’d be with them.

Just wanna say you shouldn’t believe this way of thinking. Only you know what kind of family you got, hopefully they’re good people. But, if you got up and walked out there and sat down, they’ll probably be really happy and be like “Yea, pull up a chair!” Families, oftentimes, if you walk off and go into your room, they’ll feel like you wanna be left alone and just respect that.

I know the feeling. The hardest part, to me, is actually walking out of the room and walking into the scenario. Everyone’s eyes turn to you, they’re very aware that you are inviting yourself to join them. That’s why people usually say something like “Yea, pull up a chair!” Because they want you to feel invited and comfortable. And then you sit down and, you’re there and comfortable in the situation and you can fit right in. You can just listen or get yourself more used to speaking up. Join in the conversation, bring up a brand new topic and see how the conversation goes in a whole different direction from where it would have if you had never joined.

The hardest part is getting out of the room and the more you stay in there, the harder it gets to want to leave. Sometimes I’ve had it to where I just sat in my room thirsty as hell, waiting for people to leave so I could fix something to drink. The best thing to always do is just don’t think, take a breath, get up and walk through the door.

Take it from me, the more cooped up you let yourself get, the harder it is to leave your comfort zone. The more out of practice you get with your social skills and level of comfort around people, the more you prefer staying alone. Eventually it might get where you desperately want a group of people you know to be able to walk up and join. But now, where you’re at in life, you will have to go out and meet brand new people, and you feel so far behind in social skills.

The older I get, the more I wish I could go back through my life and take advantage of all the opportunities I had that I decided instead to stay in the room. Aside from maybe feeling uncomfortable in the moment, I’ve never regretted any of the opportunities I took. 


Sorry OP, I know you wasn’t asking for advice. This is just a general post for everyone, including myself"
socialanxiety,fe6c8ye,t3_enxap6,1578886763.0,"I can’t think of an example of that specific scenario occurring to me, off the top of my head, but I could probably think of similar examples from
when I was younger. I know exactly what you’re talking about and how it makes you feel. Things like this make me think about how I’m perceived. Like I become aware that my family has these thoughts of me and probably discussions amongst themselves, about whatever social shortcomings, so they came to a decision they need to be extra supportive and encouraging and try to be really emphatic about it. And like you said, makes you feel not normal, like they wouldn’t do that if they thought highly of you. By “thought highly of you” I don’t mean love, but you know what I’m talking about. Like the kind of thing you would do to a little kid to build his confidence or get him excited about something you wanted to nudge him into"
socialanxiety,fe6axzf,t3_envvbd,1578885801.0,"All the time lol. It’s like once the clock turns 8pm, I feel like I can relax. The rest of the outside world is all settled down or passed out (like, it even gives me a little anxiety to think about how the sun is coming up and it’s already tomorrow on the other side of the world). I feel like laying on the couch and vegging out to the TV is finally okay and expected for me to be doing (as opposed to at 1 pm on a Saturday, or Monday for that matter. I’ll still do it, but at least at night time I can give myself permission to do it without feeling shame lol). And I take this comfort in the fact that I don’t have any expectations or responsibilities until tomorrow. For the next 4 hours I am free to zone it all out and just sit in comfort and get lost in some story 

Then, the clock starts ticking down and all of a sudden it’s 11:45. If I go to bed now, I’m just gonna lay there in silence and think about tomorrow until I slip away and pass out and OH SHIT it’s tomorrow already! 

So I give myself a “treat” - well one more hour, one more episode. And that’s over before you know it, and a little longer wouldn’t hurt, I’ll still be able to sleep for 5 hours....."

Staying in and having a depressive episode, the problem is that it will get easier and easier. You get more comfortable in your comfort zone, and pretty soon that’s all you’re doing and it gets harder and harder to go out. The panic and depression tightens it’s grip on you"
freefolk,fe66w1g,t1_fe38fb6,1578883132.0,I can hear those books going into his inventory as I read this
TrueDetective,fe4hxue,t3_enly03,1578859519.0,"Remember that everything leading up to the cook lab, Rust was not even supposed to be working. He took time off to see his pops, who had leukemia. Right before that, he stole the bag of coke from evidence. And he’s over in Texas, doing drugs and being seen on the streets. Basically being undercover without authorization or knowledge of his superiors. He illegally participates in the raid at the projects where people get killed, illegally kidnaps and assaults Ginger to set up the meet with Dewall. They had no good reason to be tailing Dewall at that time, other than an easy tip off from a confidential informant"
TrueDetective,fe4fv0h,t1_fe441ih,1578858834.0,"I doubt he feels trapped because of anything like that. I think he’s lived in all the areas he’s set his stories so far. Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and California"
TrueDetective,fe4av1m,t1_fdyokee,1578857401.0,"One of the great transition shots for me, when Rust is on a double date with Laurie, he’s holding her hand and he and Marty exchange a look. He’s surrounded by the only 3 friends he has in the world. He smiles, but he’s got a look in his eye that this won’t last, he is faking being happy, fulfilled. Then it abruptly cuts to him in 2012, same shot, seated at a table, surrounded by smoke, eyes down, looking absolutely miserable and completely alone. That cut just nails his character and the themes of the show

Edit: Suggestion that both shots would be great to include in something like this"
TrueDetective,fe47lpy,t1_fe1w86l,1578856477.0,"I think there’s an argument to made for Rust as the iconic True Detective. Definitely the most obsessive about the job and puts in the hours to earn the title. When he’s not fixating on the case, he keeps himself busy by investigating the secret truth of the universe. If it weren’t for Rust and McConoughay, good chance we may not have the show or a third season. First thing most people think about when they hear “True Detective”. Probably tops most people’s list for their favorite character 

On the one hand, I guess some fans are sick of the sub being majority posts about S1 when there are 2 other seasons. But that kinda goes to show that Rust/Marty are the main thing keeping the sub alive in the off season. I honestly doubt I’d come here if it were just about S2 and/or 3. Not that I dislike those seasons. I guess I’m a “fanboy”, but S1 is what keeps me coming back to discuss 

I’m cool with whatever, but if it were a vote, my vote goes to Rust. Ali was fantastic in the role and I’m happy to have him rep the sub as well. I just feel like Rust is the iconic character, like Tony is to Sopranos or Heisenberg to B.B. Imho"
Watchmen,fdxlne1,t3_enatd4,1578770223.0,"Oh good point, that would have been cool. Surely they considered it. These shows always want to leave you with a particular feeling or final thought to mull over during the credits, with the music, final shot, and the cut to black credits at the end of each episode. Whether it’s a page turner cliffhanger or some statement they’re trying to leave you with. So I’m guessing they discussed it and thought that having to read a quote in the middle of that would distract or interrupt the flow of the experience they’re trying to create for the viewer. 

Like, to cut from the foot over the water to “I am the Eggman, I am the Walrus” would throw off the attention from the ending. Dumb example, because that would be a really bad quote but you get what I’m saying?

Perhaps if they included it after the credits, before the HBO logo?"

Breaking Bad is up there, in quality, but I didn’t get quite as invested in the characters as I did those three

Watchmen,fdoyn0a,t3_emgnze,1578615872.0,"Oh, I never knew until now that song Oh What A Beautiful Mornin’ is from Oklahoma, til I recognized the lyric. Don’t even know where I heard that. I enjoy some musicals but have never seen Oklahoma

I did really like the way they incorporated the musical into the show, with the black production of Oklahoma, “Pore Judd Is Dead”, and that was a great title for the first episode. It’s Summer And We’re Running Out Of Ice (which is a lyric from the song Pore Judd Is Dead). Things are heating up, the clock is ticking down, racial tensions are reaching a boiling point and they’re running out of ways to cool down the situation. That one title captures the setting (OK), the theme (racial tension), the Watchmen metaphor of the clock nearing midnight, and the end of the episode (the song is sung by the main character, the “hero” trying to manipulate the villain Judd into killing himself).

Super clever when you think. One thing I really respected about the show, it had so many details that had, not one or two, but multiple layers of symbolism to the story. Like a gear in a clock, connecting with multiple other gears. And it evokes the “chicken or the egg”, which idea or layer of symbolism came first?"
Watchmen,fdodc2q,t3_emfom5,1578603066.0,"Sure. If you think she’d be interested, I’d recommend showing her the film, then watching this 17 min video, or something similar, that explains the comic and the ending before starting the show

Watchmen,fdlo0d0,t3_em0s5a,1578528381.0,"About as low effort as it gets. Well done.

Actually just finished watching this series last night, after finishing the really surprisingly great Bojack Horeseman, and looking for another cartoon because I enjoyed that so much 

It was okay. I didn’t not like it. Had its moments. But it just felt like a retread of all the ideas we’ve already seen in all these exact same blue collar sitcoms and cartoons over the past 30 years. Don’t really get the appeal of gross out humor. All the kid characters, I felt like I’ve already seen before in all the other cartoons just like this one. It definitely had “Inspired by the comedy stylings of Bill Burr” written all over it. Granted, I’ve never watched an entire special of his, so I’m sure he does some worthwhile stuff. But I can just picture him onstage, being like “I tell ya, my old man, he’d be like ‘I’m tryin ta have a fuckin fatha son moment, ya fuckin nitwit! I’m gonna put ya through tha fuckin wall!!! Fuckin hippies and commies and everything fuckin Made In China!!! Fuck you! Ya motha shoulda had a abortion!!!” And the audience laughs because.... he’s being really animated, loud, and aggressive, I guess? But that “dysfunctional family, kids today just don’t know how I had it with my racist baby boomer father” humor is so played out and predictable by this point, I’m surprised any comedians can still get away with it. Dennis Leary was really the nail in the coffin for that kinda low effort humor 

A few lines by the mustache neighbor didn’t make me laugh or “Hmph” or anything, but I found some humor in it, I guess, while I sat there blankly watching the show. But I have a very particular sense of humor, most shows don’t make me laugh. I didn’t watch it for the comedy, but kept watching for the storylines and animation, and it had some heart. I do like how this and especially Bojack have story arcs for the season and things progress and change. It’s not your typical sitcom “hit the reset button at the end of every episode” formula 

Idk why I felt compelled to put a whole review on this meme on a Watchmen sub, unrelated to Watchmen except the title references a Watchmen joke from a completely different cartoon along with the title of the above show (F Is For Family, btw, if anybody was wondering). But, there you have it"
Watchmen,fdlltnl,t1_fdghx59,1578526932.0,Right. His worth as a character isn’t measured by what he does to save the heroes or punish the wicked. That should never be a metric by how you judge a character. He’s supposed to make you think

“Fine like this.” AHAHAHA CLAP CLAP CLAP WOOOO"
Watchmen,fdle2yd,t1_fdl8c4p,1578522046.0,">Like, we already saw that in the scene before: ""questionable person wants godhood, they must be stopped"". It was just the same thing times two...

Right. Lol, you keep expecting a reveal like Ozymandias in the original, where this big secret plan comes out of nowhere to connect all the dots of the story 

On that same page, one of the things I loved about the original, it starts out as a simple whodunnit murder mystery. And you find out whodunnit at the end, when it all comes together. The show pretty much gave us whodunnit along with the crime scene lol. Tbf, I did really like the idea and thought it was clever how they incorporated Manhattan’s nature into the mystery, so that our investigator finds out she is in a way responsible for the initial murder

I too was let down by the conclusion to Looking Glass’ arc. The ending of his episode was a great cliffhanger. Then they spoil the aftermath shootout in the Teaser. It was one of my biggest excitements about the finale “Looking Glass is gonna do some cool shit!” Lol. When the Rorschach’s head exploded as he was about to shoot Angela at the end of Ep8, I thought it was gonna be Looking Glass behind. But I was expecting some kind of reveal like that, maybe then a flashback to how he killed the 7K home invaders. But he was just there. 

And honestly, unless I’m missing something, it doesn’t really make sense how he could just come show up and infiltrate the group without being questioned. *Nobody* was like “So what happened to the hit squad we sent to Wade’s house? What happened to Wade? Maybe we better go check...”. Nobody recognizes the mask Wade is wearing? You spend every day in a group like that, you’re gonna be like “Oh, cool Rorschach design! Check out mine!” And start to recognize people by their designs

And I really wanted a better confrontation between him and Ozy. Great opportunity for some cool symbolism, Ozymandias finally having to “look himself in the mirror” by facing one of his victims"
Watchmen,fdlc2bm,t1_fdkrr89,1578520824.0,"Yea, I agree about Manhattan, it just hasn’t sat right with me since the finale. If people loved it, that’s great. I’m certainly not one of those who is gonna trash the show and say it sucks because certain things don’t conform to my expectations for the story

But it just doesn’t really fit, to me, as something Manhattan could do or would do (Edit: the egg, I mean. It’s just way too simplistic and honestly kinda pointless). In the same way, I realize it’s kinda ridiculous to talk about realism in a show of this nature, but one thing I loved about Manhattan’s origin and the entire original story, it felt realistic to me. Osterman coming back from being seemingly zapped into non existence is unexplainable. It’s a miracle. Something that cannot be understood or recreated. As hard as the Russians or anybody may try, it’s all just a crap shoot. You blast somebody into nothing and then just wait and see if they come back. 

It just feels too unrealistic to me that Trieu could get these scientists who can understand the nature of Manhattan enough (without even having him to study or experiment on) that they could come up with a machine to destroy him and at the same time transfer his abilities into another human being. That’s just too far of a leap. I can suspend my disbelief and accept it, but it doesn’t really jibe with the world Moore created in the original, imho. Example, the tachyons had a cool explanation and logic but there’s no reason why his lithium would trap him or the scientists would hypothesize that (in assuming 7K got that idea from Trieu).  

And there were little things that felt out of character. Like Veidt is the only person Manhattan told he was gonna go off to a new galaxy. I don’t see that Adrian Veidt being like “And you think I can get in touch with him on Mars! Oh, he’s not on Mars? Shit.” If anybody in the world knows about large scale hoaxes and why that would be beneficial for people to think he’s still on Mars, it’s Ozymandias. Not to mention, I’ve alwats felt like he has this Lex Luthor complex with Manhattan.  He’s going to immediately question that footage, so he would take enough interest to recognize that Manhattan is carrying out a series of predetermined patterns. Unless maybe these patterns are consistently different and changing, not on some loop like a computer program 

The video didn’t really bother me, I can buy that from Ozy. Doesn’t really seem like they would reveal it to a young, newly inducted Senator (can’t remember the exact title of the position that warranted him having to be in the know, but maybe that makes it make a little more sense) like Keene 

I loved the storytelling. Just the finale kinda took a big step backwards, imo, in living up to the narrative of the original graphic novel.

Watchmen,fdl88g2,t1_fdl0fd0,1578518710.0,"Won’t happen, but I wouldn’t mind seeing a brand new story that isn’t beholden to anything they did on Lindelof’s season. Just a new story that uses Watchmen as its history in the same manner. 

Course, there were certain things and details that fit perfectly with a modern television adaptation of Watchmen, so doing a new one would be too hard to avoid a retread or feeling like it’s just copying elements from Lindelof’s. Not to mention that would be confusing for the general audience lol. 

It’s just a shame because it’s such a rich world and so many things you can do with a HBO series adaptation. 9 episodes just can’t cover all the great possibilities. But it’s hard for me to see where they would go from here with the story Lindelof did and still make it feel like a true Watchmen story in the same way. I almost wish they had planned it as multiple seasons but I totally get why they wouldn’t, as the original story is a concise, complete story told in 12 issues with no filler 

Definitely would like to see Dan and how he possibly gets out of prison, and Ozy’s trial could be pretty fascinating. But where do you go with all that, idk. Wouldn’t be too crazy about having Dr Manhattan out of the picture and Angela maybe/maybe not taking on that role. I really wanna see more of the character Looking Glass"

socialanxiety,fdip1hn,t3_elbac7,1578447835.0,"You had to just go stand in front of the class for 30 seconds? Never heard of that in a speech class before. Actually kind of a cool idea, on the teachers part. Just allow people to get used to being in that position with everyone looking at them, minus the added pressure of having to speak lol. Kind of a baby steps approach, I like that idea

Yea I dreaded speech class and every speech I’ve ever given. But it’s not near as bad as you build it up in your mind. I’ve had to give plenty of speeches since my first speech class

Had to do a presentation in my masters class last semester. And it went really well. I spoke without just reading my slides. Made eye contact with students as I was speaking (which is the hardest thing for me). Spoke using my hands. I was really pleased with how it went. Compared to my very first speech class lol.

The absolute best thing you can do. Prepare it all in advance. In your own privacy, or if you got a dog or cat to watch you, present to them. Stand up and get yourself in the mindset that you are in front of the class and the teacher gives you the go ahead. Start your timer on your phone and go. “Hi. My name is....”. Get through the whole thing as if it’s your actual presentation. You’ll probably screw up or fumble with your words, can’t think of what to say, but you just recover and keep going. After it’s over, go back to where you messed up and do that over. Then do it all again.

And just keep doing this until you’ve got it down. You can give this presentation in your sleep. Then, make sure to practice a few times before the actual class. Even better if you have a friend or family member who will listen.

My first several speeches, I planned them out. But I never actually gave the full speech as if it were the real thing, in a trial run. And it did not go like I had it planned in my head. Once I started actually presenting beforehand, I felt *so* much more comfortable and prepared once I actually got up in front of everybody"
socialanxiety,fdilq1e,t3_elg3dg,1578445713.0,"You just need to be aware, in the moment, and make yourself do it. 

Which is shitty advice. But it gets easier and more comfortable and more natural the more you do it. 

Here’s the thing: I’m on a social anxiety forum, so I’m obviously self conscious and have anxiety and self doubt. Everybody does, to some extent. If I’m trying to open up, step out of my shell, talk to somebody, tell a story: I’m self consciously going to be watching them for feedback. If they’re not looking at me or not making any expressions, I’m going to feel like I’m being boring. I’m not engaging them. Whatever I’m saying is not worth saying

So, I’m not thinking badly about this person. “How rude!” I’m thinking badly about myself

And that’s one reason why it’s important to be aware of the non verbal feedback you’re giving people.

Be aware of your body language and facial expression. Watch the other person and be aware of how they’re responding. If you’re looking somebody in the eye while they’re speaking to you, you have a slight smile on your face, your eyes are kinda wide and “beaming” at them. You can feel the vibe and visibly/audibly see their excitement with the conversation growing. You’re projecting to them that you are hanging on their every word and looking forward to what’s going to come out of their mouth next. They feel interesting and engaging. They’re having fun talking to you, because subconsciously it makes them feel good about themselves.

Just do some research and look for videos on YT about body language, facial expression, posture. Practice, practice, practice. And observe and be aware how others respond to it and how it makes you feel. Because it can increase your confidence and make the conversation more fun and enjoyable for you."
socialanxiety,fdij8kl,t1_fdig941,1578444140.0,"Just wanted to add, as well:

My older cousin was always a social butterfly. But the younger one is like me. She’s struggled the same issues with social anxiety as I have 

So, during these awkward years, from age 15 to 23, or so: I imagine all the adults were thinking “I wish those two would connect and get along like they used to.” But the both of us smoked pot during those years, probably coping mechanism with our social anxiety. And it just always happened to work out, every summer. One night, after everybody had gone to bed, we’d find a way to get together and go find somewhere to hide. We’d smoke a little bit and just talk for hours. Open up. Whatever was going on in our lives over the past year. It was our way of keeping in touch over those years, when social anxiety made it really hard for us to be able to  talk to one another and be ourselves with other family members around, listening in or participating in the conversation 

Been about ten years since we’ve really had a chance to do that. And I miss that. So, once I started coming on this sub and just thinking back on my life in the context of social anxiety, I thought about that specifically 

I just remember this one time, we were probably all around 16. The three of us were together. They were talking, I was just kinda listening. And I tried to speak up.

I don’t remember what it was, but I tried to make a joke in the conversation. Really just trying to connect with my cousins and be goofy and joke around like we used to. And it was just a bad joke. Bad delivery. Awkward. Cringeworthy. I threw the ball out there and it just landed in the field.

And I remember, very vividly, I looked up and saw my older cousin (the social butterfly) shoot a glance at the younger. You could read it all over her face: *wtf was that?* And I died a little inside lol. Just one of those moments that reiterates to yourself: *This is why you don’t speak up.*

But my younger cousin, she knows that feeling. And she knew that I caught the look her sister gave her. And she picks the ball up and runs with it. Says something awkward and cringeworthy, tries to make it a joke. Just so I’m not left hanging, feeling like a dumbass.

I’m sure she doesn’t remember that. Such a small, insignificant little moment. But, on my end, that’s the kinda thing you don’t forget about a person. And I think that’s a strength of people with social anxiety. It makes us empathetic and really in tune with peoples feelings in these kinds of situations 

But, I was thinking about that a couple weeks ago, so I sent her a message just to say I thought it was cool how we always managed to find some time to hang out and catch up, one on one, every year. That it meant a lot to me. Idk if I articulated it the best, or how it came off, like just random and outta nowhere lol. I never know how I come off in a message because the other person is just seeing words on a screen in the context of their own life. But to me, that kinda shit is important. And I think people should do that more often. Take some time to send somebody a message, out of the blue, to say “Hey man, I thought about you today and I appreciate this about you....”"
socialanxiety,fdig941,t3_elc1l2,1578442216.0,"Sorry if I’m making this about me lol, but just wanted to say that I do relate. Feel free to skip down to the last two paragraphs for the part directed at you, OP:

I’m a male. I have two girl cousins. They are sisters, one about less than a year older than me, the other maybe less than a year younger. They grew up about a 7 hour drive from my childhood home. So we grew up, since diapers, together. We have home videos of us running around together, talking our own language, when we’re just learning how to walk and speak.

The families are close, their dad is my dad’s brother. Every summer for the past 33 years, the families get a cabin on the beach together for a week. It’s the big family vacation. Also, every year until our mid 20’s, their family came down and stayed at our house for a week after Christmas, because all their family ties live around my hometown

Growing up, they were like sisters and best friends to me. But different than that, because we only got to see each other for a week (two weeks once we got old enough we could stay with one another after the beach) at the mid point and the end of the year. We’d write letters and that was the big thing to look forward to all year. I went and stayed one year and saw they had a calendar in their room with my name on the date and a big circle and exclamation marks. It was just so natural, as soon as we’d get together, we’d be attached at the hip, off in our world, whatever our imaginations came up with.

It was special, and I’m grateful I had that relationship. Just one of those things that made my childhood so much better. But, my social anxiety didn’t really start until I was about 13 or 14. So, as I got into my late teens, early 20’s, it became really hard for me to connect with them. To feel comfortable around them like I used to. To know how to let my guard down, to joke around like we used to. And, of course, the real tragedy of social anxiety, you struggle to connect, but also have to worry about how the other person perceives it. Like, did they feel like I just didn’t care anymore, or wasn’t interested, or got too cool to wanna goof around with my cousins?

We’re in our 30s now. They’re off in California and New York, living these amazing lives. Both recently got married. They usually can’t make it to the beach anymore. And when they do, they’ve got their SO with them and have to spend time with their immediate family, so there’s not really much opportunities for one on one conversations. And they’re telling all these interesting details about their lives, and I haven’t felt very good about my own life for awhile, and I’m just not very comfortable talking about myself with the whole family around. I hear my aunt talking about how they want to start doing their own family vacation (instead of “The Beach”, which was always this special thing that we all looked forward to). And I totally get that, their family’s getting bigger and are spread out now. But it still kinda hurts, I’ll be honest.

So, I try to reach out, get in touch, maintain contact. Send messages. But I feel like it’s always me initiating and the conversation usually fizzles out pretty quickly. I often have a habit of writing a lot, or being really detailed when I send a message (Idk why that’s not a normal thing, whatever happened to people writing letters?) and then feel awkward about it when there’s no response. Did I say too much? Is it an inconvenience to have to read more than a few sentences?

So, idk. I feel the same way about the small group of really close friends I’ve made over my life. The relationship is really important and meaningful to me. So I try to maintain or initiate a dialogue. But I get the sense they’ve moved on to families and careers and new friend groups and don’t spend as much time thinking back on the past. Which is completely understandable. Just makes you feel left behind, in some way. Or sometimes, I just wish I could back in time and relive those memories

Anyways, if you’ve read this far lol, I always just say to myself “Why the hell not? Absolutely nothing wrong about that.” And just send them a message.:

“*Hey, I felt like we didn’t really get a chance to catch up at the funeral like I was hoping. It’s been a long time, but I think about you guys. I miss hanging out like used to.....*” Try to reinitiate that relationship. Catch up. Plan a trip. There’s nothing holding you back but your own anxiety about how it will be perceived. I would think that it would only be taken in a good way. Maybe they feel the exact same and would be thrilled if you reached out. And maybe they’re just busy and caught up with life and just don’t have the time. And that’s okay too. It’s not a reflection on you or how they feel about you. It’s just part of life, I guess."
IncelTears,fdi1mkr,t3_elg7dm,1578434134.0,"“So let’s rate this guy’s overall aspects...”

Do these people ever think about how bizarre it is, the amount of time they spend fixating on and rating other guys’ appearance? I heard the term “mog” the other day, had to look it up. I just try to imagine, all those times I’m in line at the grocery store, at a restaurant, whatever. You just kinda assume everyone standing around you is thinking about whatever normal, mundane thing. Planning their schedule, what’s for dinner, anything. So strange to think some guy would be comparing theirself to me, in this specific context. Looking at my height, jawline, hairline, build, whatever it is, to play out some kind of mogging game in their own head. Not only that, but they think all the women standing around are also doing the same thing. Ranking us in terms of our fuckability because we just happen to be two guys standing next to each other

Watchmen,fdg6oxr,t3_el85ke,1578382229.0,"One way to look at it, he is just full of shit about his whole uncompromising stance, and really just does what he wants to make himself feel better.

Maybe he only acts out violently against those who hurt what he perceives as “innocents”"
Watchmen,fdfwppo,t3_el46k8,1578372277.0,"You can also watch the entire comic in a motion comic (it’s pretty well done, imo). It’s 12 episodes, about 25 mins apiece, and covers the entire 12 issues, all available on YouTube. Here’s Chapter 1 to start you out:

https://youtu.be/mLdqKIj3-A0

Know that the actual comic includes a lot of in-universe world building material in between each issue, in the form of excerpts from books and interviews that take place in the world of Watchmen. The HBO show recreates this with its own site full of in-universe information compiled by FBI Agent Petey something (it’s called PeteyPedia)

Basically, the original 12 issues (which you can get as a single graphic novel, and also watch on YouTube) are all you need. Everything else (the HBO show, and a few other graphic novels, Doomsday Clock and Before Watchmen) is basically up to you if you want to consider it canon with the Watchmen universe. But they contradict each other, the HBO series does not use anything from Before Watchmen (a series of prequel books to the original characters in Watchmen)

The 2009 Zack Snyder film is damn good, imo. Worth watching. That’s an adaptation of the original 12 issues. Some things are lost in translation but it’s a pretty faithful adaptation, pulling panels and dialogue directly from the book in almost every scene. EXCEPT the ending to the film is much different from the ending to the book, and the book ending is canon to the HBO show. 

This video is a great overview of the story told in Watchmen the book. But only watch if you don’t mind spoilers. Or watch this after you’ve watched the Snyder film.


Watchmen Overview:
https://youtu.be/wJmg0uc3CjY


My two suggestions for if you want to watch the series:

1. Read the original 12 issue graphic novel (or at least watch the motion comic on YouTube)

2. Watch the Zack Snyder film. Then watch the above video, Watchmen Explained by Alt Shift X, which will fill in the blanks about the ending and give you better context for the book

You can choose one, or both, of the above options. But I’d recommend one before starting the HBO series, because it gives you all this added context to enjoy the show. Not absolutely necessary, you can watch and enjoy the show with no prior information, but I think it greatly increases the enjoyment to know what happened in the history of the show (the series is set in 2019, with the events of the graphic novel Watchmen having taken place in 1985)"
movies,fdfulbi,t1_fdftwcv,1578370618.0,"Yea, I’d love to see a good take on this storyline. You’d really need a full season of television, at least, to really nail it, I think.

I also wouldn’t mind if they got a good writer (Scott Snyder would be my choice) and artist duo to retell the Knightfall story arc in comics for the modern DC continuity. Like a 12 issue run in the Legends of The Dark Knight series. 

Could swap No Man’s Land with Knightfall in what I wrote above, and I would feel the same. I’m glad you included that when referring to Dark Knight Rises, a lot of people remember Knightfall but don’t remember NML or know that’s where the inspiration came from. Pretty cool Nolan decided to take from both stories, in addition to Dark Knight Returns, all in one film to close out his trilogy.

socialanxiety,fdfrxjt,t3_el4ena,1578368717.0,I’d say that’s a pretty good job they did
Watchmen,fdfdsxw,t1_fde263r,1578359343.0,"Yeah, but I agree with the above poster. There is still something lost from the original point Moore was making with his ending. It serves the same purpose in the narrative, sure. But I much prefer what Moore did and I think it’s a more interesting and compelling idea. Like, in the book, the threat is a complete impartial outsider to humanity, as a whole. In the film, there is still going to be major blame and resentment towards the US. It’s just different, and I don’t think it would unite us as a species, or put our own conflicts into a new perspective, in quite the same way (that’s the general idea of Veidt’s plan anyways).

Not to say I have anything against what the film did. It’s just, if I’m comparing the two as narrative devices, I think the original ending was a much better storytelling accomplishment. And that’s not even getting into the difference in effect on the audience between what we saw in the film, and those pages showing the death and destruction in the book, where I think the book was far and away more impactful

I get why they made that choice in the movie. But I think they should have rethought it. I love the film as its’ own thing, I judge it as something completely separate from the book. But there are definitely some things I think could have improved it. And going with the original ending is one of those choices. But I get why people defend it"
Watchmen,fdfcsqu,t3_ekr9gc,1578358659.0,"Idk, I’d have to put some thought in to your specific question

I much prefer the book ending. This idea that we find out we aren’t alone in our existence and their are threats from beyond our planet. It puts our own conflicts and destruction into perspective. We realize we all have to be on the same side. This whole idea of tribalism is what starts these conflicts in the first place. Strength in numbers and competition for resources, so we find ways to categorize groups, whether it’s race or some belief. But when it’s our very existence and survival at stake, those differences and lines we’ve drawn don’t really seem so important.

It’s just a brilliant way to end the story. And I feel like the movie version loses some of that because Manhattan was an American weapon to begin with. He was not a complete and impartial outsider 

One of my favorite quotes from the book is the whole line about “What I said was God exists and he is American. If that thought fills you with existential dread, you are still sane”, paraphrased. It really highlights the absurdity and insanity of the idea that “God is on our side”. God is tribal. God created us all, but for some reason, chooses sides. Because *our* religion is the correct one, and we worship God in the way that He intended for Himself to be worshipped when He created us. Because being worshipped is important to Him. That’s actually a pretty terrifying thought if you really think about if that were true. And you don’t often see art addressing that idea, so it’s really brilliant the way Moore explores this 

I also really liked the setup they had going in the beginning of the series. “God” genuinely lost interest in humanity and is gone, out into the cosmos, left us to fend for ourselves. But, it would benefit people in power to create the illusion he’s up there on Mars. He hasn’t lost interest, he still cares. He’s up there, watching down on us. They set up these prayer booths to send messages to Mars to placate people, keep them comfortable and docile. While also collecting all of the information in the messages. Data, of course, is one of the most valuable commodities to control. At the same time, it sends the message out to all of our enemies that God is still up there, watching down on us. And never forget, he *is* American. It’s a way of maintaining our power through fear.

Of course, this changes in the narrative around episode 7. But I thought it was a great allegory for Religion (or Belief) and Fear as being the most powerful ways of maintaining control over the population. Would have really liked to have seen this whole idea explored a little more. It’s one of the more interesting and compelling ideas you can cultivate from the ending of the original story, imho.

Apologies that was a bit off track and not exactly what the OP was asking"
Watchmen,fdfaq7e,t3_eks6so,1578357272.0,Nice! Need to throw some bright yellow and swimming pool blue colors in there
Watchmen,fdfal8l,t3_el211m,1578357180.0,"OzyMANdias is a shining example of the MGTOW philosophy (Men Going Their Own Way). If he were to get laid, he would just be a soy boy beta cuck like the rest of us"
Watchmen,fdf5nhg,t1_fddy75b,1578353868.0,"Yea, I initially hated the idea of Cal being Manhattan, as soon as it was suggested after the second episode. But A God Walks Into ABar made me say “Okay, I’m willing to get on board with this.”

It was a really well crafted story, and I liked how they went full steam ahead and upped the ante with how Manhattan’s perception of time and his existence played a direct role in the storytelling. Like using Manhattan as a conduit for one character speaking to another from future to past, which has a cause and effect paradox that sets into motion the original murder that kicks this story into motion. That was clever as hell. Like a watchmaker and his watch. Every piece in place.

It kinda did fall apart a bit, for me, with the finale. And I wasn’t crazy about how they handled the character of Manhattan

He is a miracle. An exact, perfect combination of events that no one will ever understand how his consciousness was able to still exist in the ether and piece himself back together. The Russians can try all day to train and zap their best and brightest volunteers into nonexistence, and then they just have to wait to see if anything comes back. But nobody can truly understand or replicate the exact circumstances that allowed Dr Manhattan to exist.

To me, it’s probably the most interesting and compelling story of somebody with super powers I’ve ever read.

In my humble and singular opinion, it just kinda cheapens his story and his abilities that someone like Trieu could capture him and just make some machine that they never have to explain. Just a comic book movie trope, it spins and has lights and shoots out a big blue energy blast. And this can somehow destroy him when the book made it clear that can’t really be done. And it just transfers his powers into her. How did these scientists come up with this machine? What experiments could they possibly have done to understand how this would even work? Why does the lithium Manhattan created have this effect of keeping him trapped, and how would they possibly hypothesize that would work? In the book, it gives cool explanations behind how Manhattan was created and how the tachyons interfere with his abilities to know the future.



Obviously, any writer can make up anything they want about Manhattan, because his abilities can really be limited only by your imagination. But, I feel like it’s a misunderstanding (maybe that’s the wrong word to use), and cheapens the concept of Manhattan, that he can just “Transfer his atomic components into some organic matter that you consume and theoretically, now you have his powers.” I don’t feel like it should work like that.

And it just sort of happens at the end, it seems like the only real narrative point is to have this Inception style final shot. Not really sure what they’re trying to say with that ending. To me, it’s played as some kind of triumphant or hopeful moment. Because “For all Manhattan could do, he coulda done more...”. The whole question is should he interfere in the first place. So, idk if we’re supposed to feel hopeful that our protagonist, a strong black female, now may have these powers (and I have no racial or gender issues whatsoever. I don’t care who it is in that final scene, I’d feel the same way).

And imagine if, in our world, Donald Trump or Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, anybody for that matter, had some way of possibly gaining that level of power. Nobody would be okay with this. You would have to suicide bomb that shit to try and prevent it from happening.  Nobody should have that level of power, doesn’t matter if they’re controlling or zapping white supremacists out of existence or not. I feel like however they interfere, it’s going to have far reaching consequences. 

So I felt like it was kinda ridiculous everyone is just standing around, watching all this like “Let’s see what happens.” Okay, they’d probably get killed, but I would feel like you’ve got to try something. I don’t think Ozy should be the one to have to explain to the other characters why a person like Trieu should never gain that level of power. That should be blatantly obvious. And Looking Glass, of all characters, is like “What makes you think she won’t change the world?” Dude, it’s not worth the risk to try and find out, because once we get to that point, there’s no going back. She is a God now, and we live in her world. I just feel like characters were unrealistically not as concerned about that as they should have been. The whole fascinating thing about DM’s story in the book, is that he didn’t choose those powers, it just happened to him.

And I don’t think it’s okay for Angela to have those powers. And, it’s unrealistic she doesn’t even take the time to think about the actual consequences. The curse of being Dr Manhattan. The fact that you will be immortal and outlive everyone you’ll ever love, for one thing. She just gulps the egg down as soon as she realizes it’s a possibility, just to test it out and see if she can now walk on water. It doesn’t seem like something Dr Manhattan would just do, even for someone he loves and trusts. At least not without long discussions about exactly what the consequences and implications would be. Why would he not explain exactly what he was doing? Just to obtuse about it, as a storytelling device 

So yea, I’m not shitting on the show or anything. “If you don’t like my story, write your own” and all that. Fair enough. I loved the show. Those were just some of the criticisms I have of the finale and how they handled the Manhattan character"
Watchmen,fdf1pew,t1_fdduu2m,1578351306.0,"To me, it’s kinda pointless to compare the film with the series. They’re two totally different things. The show had all the storytelling advantages afforded an HBO series in the current age of television, and basically had complete creative freedom to tell whatever story they want. The movie had 3 hours to just adapt the book as best they could in that amount of time, with all the expectations of a studio big budget blockbuster film 

I do really appreciate that the show allowed the comic book to be the exact history of this particular world. Every panel in the book, every costume and line of dialogue, happened exactly as it occurred in the book (with a few minor exceptions of course). But, again, they didn’t have to recreate all of that. They just had to allow it to be, and tell a brand new story

It’s just apples and oranges to argue that one or the other does a better job adapting the source material, and really it’s unfair to the film to try and compare"
Watchmen,fdf14r8,t1_fddsfxi,1578350949.0,"My only complaints, off top of my head, was the alley fight with Nite Owl and Silk Spectre against the Knot Tops was just a bit too ridiculous and over the top. Also, I think it would’ve been better to do the original Rorschach origin with chaining the guy up and burning the building, over the cleaver scene, which was also a bit pointless

And I don’t really mind the changing of the ending, but it would’ve been nice if they stayed faithful to the original ending. Maybe it wouldn’t have translated well or taken a lot more time to explain. Idk. Could only judge it if I saw it. Too bad they didn’t film an alternate version and release that as the Director’s Cut"
Watchmen,fdf0pv3,t1_fdds0x1,1578350685.0,"I only started really coming on this sub or following the Watchmen fan base when the show became a thing. And I was kinda surprised the level of negativity toward the film from Watchmen fans. Although not all that surprised because I feel like Zack Snyder has become a punching bag for comic fans online. Not saying a lot of the criticism is unwarranted.

Idk. I’ve always loved the film. Got my friend to read the comic and we went with my brother to see the movie in theaters and it’s one of my better memories of going to the cinema.

For lack of better terms, I just love those comic book films that treat the subject matter in a very serious and adult way. Like The Dark Knight for example. I wish there were more films like that. 

This movie, the soundtrack, the fact that it takes place in our reality with references to Vietnam and politics of the era. It’s kinda like the Apocalypse Now of comic book films to me. And I recommend going to look at the IMDb trivia for the movie, all kinds of interesting little world building details they packed into the shots 

I just enjoy the film completely separate from the book and don’t try to compare the two. To me, the book exists in a reality like our own. It’s gritty and real, raw, the costumes are silly, the characters more pathetic. The movie is more Hollywood: sleek, stylized, cool, bombastic action scenes and imagery. So I see how people say it misses the tone of the source material. But that’s fine by me. I kinda prefer it that way. I don’t need to see the book translated exactly to the screen. It’s more fun for me to watch the film as it is, and the reality of the book exists in my imagination. I don’t think I’m gonna get anything extra out of seeing the tone or themes of the book put to film 

I do think it’s unfair everyone accuses Snyder of completely misunderstanding the book. All kinds of people worked on putting that film to the screen and they agreed on how they wanted to do it. I’m sure there were plenty of discussions about the tone of the book and they probably just decided to go in a different direction, that this would be better fitting for a big budget blockbuster film. And I tend to agree, because I love the tone of the movie. It’s different, but that’s okay by me"

For whatever reason, I’ve lost interest or just get distracted each time by the end of the third story (Liam Neesen and the guy with no arms and legs). I did enjoy the Buster Scruggs story, but it was so short. I’m sure there’s some common theme that connects the stories, of deeper symbolism, but I’m just kinda watching it like “What’s the point of this?” And inevitably think of something else to watch and switch over. At some point, I’m gonna watch the other 3 stories and maybe it will change my mind

It’s a shame cause I’m always on the lookout for a new Western film that does something different with the genre"
TrueDetective,fdevejo,t1_fdeauh6,1578347405.0,"I know right. Rust has a lot of flaws. But he has some traits you have to admire. One of which is that he stands his ground nd won’t let anyone make him look in the other direction out of fear, shame, or intimidation

“I’ll have boss crackas splittin yo ass in Angola!” 

“Yea, we’ll talk about that. And some other things...”

“You’re gonna wanna swing some dick on this, Steve. I’m gonna give you a couple reasons why you won’t.” Lol"
TrueDetective,fdeunln,t3_ekx7sg,1578346961.0,"The way I look at this scene:

When Rust shows up drunk to Marty’s, he’s ashamed. He’s looking at the ground, can’t even look up to meet Marty’s eyes.

One of the biggest themes of the show is identity. Who are we on the inside? A lot of symbolism of masks, faces, eyes, mirrors, reflection. Billy Lee Tuttle wears a mask in public. The good man doing good deeds, cares about the community and his ministry. Rust sees beyond his mask.

When he makes the comment about “can’t trust a man who can’t trust himself with a beer”, he’s taking a shot at Rust. *I been looking into you, boy. You have secrets, weaknesses I can exploit. You might wanna back off before you get in over your head.*

He’s just staring Rust down and Rust never breaks eye contact. His response, “Dead women and children.” Is his way of saying *I been looking into you too. Whatever I’ve got to be ashamed of, I can own that. You’ve got secrets way worse.* And he got the message. As powerful and protected as he thinks he is, he felt fear in that moment. And Rust is beyond that. Rust’s only fear is coming back to this motherfucker after he dies.

Rust refers back to this moment when he tells Marty, “I looked into Billy Tuttle’s eyes. And he looked in mine. He got me suspended.” It’s also referenced when Marty asks, about the tape, “You watch that whole thing?”

“Had to. Had to see if any of them took off their masks. None did. I won’t avert my eyes. Not anymore.”

Kinda like the little girl says of Childress, “He made me watch what he did to Billy. He made me watch.” Rust feels that he owes it to them kids and murdered women to watch. He’s gonna stare into the darkness and not look away. He talks about all that time spent, looking a phptos of D.B.s. Looking into their eyes to see what they felt at the moment of death.

There’s a quote, something like “You stare into the abyss long enough, sometimes the abyss stares back”. Rust owns his sins. He won’t allow any of these men to make him back down, or look the other direction. He’s gonna stare them directly back in the eyes and say *I see beyond the mask that you wear, to who you really are.*

Like he says, “You gotta be honest about what’s going on in here.” *taps his temple* “A locked room.*"
Watchmen,fdd8md0,t1_fdd50vi,1578299824.0,I assume he was going to make the Game Warden regardless just to entertain himself. But he knew on the first day he got there his one chance of escape would be arriving in 5 years. He just hadn’t decided yet that he wanted to go home.but I think either way he would have created the Game Warden as a challenge and way to keep sharp
socialanxiety,fdd7le1,t1_fdcpiyq,1578298385.0,"All of this. Just be aware of the time when you can put yourself in an uncomfortable position, and go for it anyways. Train yourself to speak up and to talk off the top of your head without rehearsing, be an active participant in a conversation, be clear and direct with what you’re thinking, make an effort to be more decisive. Body language and posture can help too. Speak with your hands. Plant your feet firmly. Try to feel like you own your space. And just be aware of those times when you feel like you should or could assert yourself

It sounds easier said than done. But it’s a gradual process. Like anything else you want to get better at, you have to practice and train. And the more you do it, the more comfortable and natural feeling it should get"
socialanxiety,fdd69vq,t1_fdd4htf,1578296652.0,"Great advice. And I think the more practice you get with speaking up and “freestyling” with the conversation, the more comfortable it gets. Maybe more natural even.

I think it helps to look at it like a game. A conversation or group interaction is like a ship on the river. It can meander, slow down, get more exciting, stop dead in its tracks, branch off into infinite possible directions. If you’re aware of it, you can feel the vibe of a conversation. Like the force in Star Wars. You can tell when they’re talking about something they’re excited about or interested in, you can tell who all is engaged in the dialogue. 

So try to see what little things you can do to steer the course of the conversation, and be aware of it when you do it. Points for when you bring up a new topic, change the subject, get someone to laugh, get somebody from outside the conversation engaged in the discussion, bring up a question that everybody is trying to figure out, get someone sharing something personal, share something personal yourself, get a recurring joke going, tell a story, etc etc. 

See if you can steer this conversation into positive directions that it would have not gone if you weren’t taking part in the discussion. I also really like your metaphor of a song. That’s even better than a ship lol"
socialanxiety,fdd5636,t3_ekohv9,1578295266.0,"That makes you a good person. And keep in mind that when somebody is just babbling to you, they might be feeling the same way and doing the same thing. I think it’s probably just a natural social instinct for people to want the others to feel comfortable in situations and people are often uncomfortable letting it just be silent. You’re just usually used to falling into the role of allowing the others in the group to control the comfort level of the interaction. So, when that happens with multiple anxious people, somebody needs to step up to fill the social vacuum. And that’s you and that’s a good thing"
socialanxiety,fdd4rr1,t1_fdcho4o,1578294764.0,"Agreed man. If I were there, they were the ones who would’ve made me cringe. I notice all the time people getting excited or really high energy telling a story. And I don’t think nothing of it, just listen to what they have to say like a normal, friendly person would. The type of people who try and cut somebody down when they’re talking are just showing their own insecurity. It just sucks the fun out of the room and makes an awkward moment for the whole group in the interaction. They’re the ones who are being socially inept.

OP, you should just go in there tomorrow and get excited, tell stories, ask questions. Don’t give that moment another thought."
IncelTears,fdd3iwp,t1_fdd28u7,1578293294.0,"I agree. Also, we’re only getting his account of this thing, so we don’t know what was said or whether she did/didn’t lead him on. I feel like, if I was gaming with a girl every week and she offered to pay for a year of Nintendo Online (Idk how much this cost), It would occur to me to let her know I’m in a relationship, just so that there’s no confusion. Probably inexperienced guy, really wants a girlfriend, let his fantasies get ahead of him, and got his hopes crushed. He’s venting in, what seems to me, a healthy way. As long as he moves on and isn’t posting in an Incel reddit 3 months from now, I think this is the opposite of how an Incel would react"
Watchmen,fdcnjwv,t1_fdbja1d,1578279343.0,"Yea man. Kinda bums me out. He’s such a great character. I think he’s probably the best of all the costumed vigilante personas, in terms of fitting in with the pantheon of the original created characters. The others are good, and Sister Night was a really clever creation, but Looking Glass just fits perfect among the OCs.

I was kinda disappointed, his story and episode were so good and it ended in such a good cliffhanger. I feel like it didn’t really pay off in the finale as well as I had set my expectations. Be a shame that we probably won’t get to ever see the character further explored. With the setting of OK and the history explored in the series, his character would have made for a fantastic modern western story arc. Loved the show, but can’t help but think how the story could have been improved if they expanded to 12 episodes"

Watchmen,fdc5mo0,t1_fdbtm7j,1578267574.0,"I wish he would just give it a chance, simply from the perspective of storytelling. He has to at least respect that there are people out there who want to share stories with the world by building upon characters and mythology created by someone else. Because, at one point, he was doing the exact same thing. I respect his right to not have anything to do with it, but I’d just be genuinely curious to hear what he thought about what they did with the world he built. I imagine there’s some things he’d like and probably some things he wouldn’t care for. But the whole Hooded Justice origin story, I feel like is something he’d look back on what he made and how they took the ball and ran with it, and he’d think “Damn, that’s a good job.”"

I’ve never heard these terms in my life before today lol). And then, those same two foids (I don’t even know wtf that means) came back out of the store and were visibly more impressed by the third guy’s two inches in height over the middle Incel. So they smile at him and treat the middle Incel with disdain, which serves to further validate both Incels’ world views. 

Then, plot twist, the currycel wasn’t an Incel at all, and he happily leaves with his girlfriend. And the middle Incel and the third Incel’s jaws both drop and they look at each other and realize they were the truecels all along. 

This entire scenario plays out with no words being exchanged at all, but everybody involved was very aware of all the social dynamics at play

But, *further* plot twist: This all played out in the imagination of the original turbo manlet currycel when some random 5’6” guy came and stood behind him to get a newspaper out of the little box. The turbo manlet then leaves with his “girlfriend” which is actually a cantaloupe that he just brought that he plans to go have sex with, just as soon as he shares this story from the POV of the 5’6” Incel, who really wasn’t an Incel at all because he has better shit to think about in his private moments"

It helps me to look at it like the movie is the Hollywood version of the events in the comic. It’s sleek, stylized, has bombastic action sequences and over the top violence. I look at it like the events of the comic are much more gritty, raw, real. And the story of the comic is the exact history of the HBO show.

Just hung back in my comfort zone instead of being uncomfortable and vulnerable, trying to meet people, make friends, talk to a girl, ask her out, things like that.

And mark down on some list what number experiment he is. And they just wait around for any kind of strange activity. And continue the process. Nobody can understand how Osterman’s consciousness was able to remain in the ether to reconstruct himself. All they can do is try to recreate it and hope.

But once it was all over, I was just kinda sad. Thinking “Okay, back to this...”

All this time, I didn’t really think about New Years Eve or the fact that the entire decade was about to be over. It wasn’t until NYE evening, I’m going about my regular routine, walking the dog and I see all these fireworks going off around town and it really hit me. It’s New Years Eve right now and I’m not celebrating with anybody, don’t have any plans, nobody I can really even call. Just text Happy New Years messages to my few close friends who all live several states away now, with families and careers and don’t seem to have much time to talk anymore.

It was just kinda depressing. Like I said, not at all what I would have wanted for my life at this age, and not really sure how to get it on track. High school, college, at least there were all kinds of opportunities, young people out there in the same situation in life who were just looking to have fun and have experiences and be free.

Watchmen,fcvp2ng,t1_fcvbkbt,1578006901.0,"I think they definitely predict how the internet will react, what will become memes, etc. Like all the Manhattan’s dick references in the show was obviously them being self aware about how it became a meme after the movie. Or guaranteed they joked beforehand about how #Wokemen would become a hashtag used by the alt right detractors of the show 

I think they also simply wanted to include an Easter egg tie in to reward the fans who wanted to do a deep dive on the Peteypedia. Lindelof tried something similar with all this supplemental online material for Lost, spurred on all these theories, and as I recall it was ultimately all rather pointless. So I think this go round, he wanted to have the material more directly connected to what we were watching on the show. “Let’s add a masked character similar to Hooded Justice who makes a random appearance and his identity is never revealed, but only hinted at through the supplemental material, to make all of that more worth the fans’ time to look through. And it will become a meme and everybody will make posts like Who Lubes The Lubeman for the karma, and make it more fun for the fan base.”

Not out meeting interesting people or seeing new things, having new experiences. Not having these actual interesting hobbies that I can talk to people about when they ask about what I do. It’s not at all what I would have pictured or wanted to be doing at this age, when I was a teenager picturing my future. Not at all what I want to be doing with my time right now. I wonder what the outside world, people who know me, think about all of this.

And I also think about how, the more and more time I spend doing this routine or pattern, the further behind, more out of practice, more inexperienced at doing all of the above things. And how each year is passing it seems the older you get, the more difficult it is to have these opportunities, everybody is settling down. And all that just makes my comfort zone more comfortable, and all of it is this cycle that feeds itself

Makes me wonder how I will look back on this time and how will I look back on the decade of the ‘20s when 2030 comes around

All of this gives me anxiety, so I distract myself in my routine and only think about it every so often.

Yea man, I think both me and you need to make a New Years resolution to make concrete steps at changing our outlook and situation. Life flies by and the more you put it off, the worse it’s going to get. You’ll never regret choosing to make a change, you’ll only regret not doing it sooner"
