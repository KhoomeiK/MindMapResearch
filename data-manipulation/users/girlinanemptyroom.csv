actuallesbians,fffcsbi,t3_et17fg,1579881116.0,"This is so true right now. I do have a bit of a crush on a girl right now. I've known her for a few years. She was in a relationship when we meet, but I thought she was super cute. They broke up last year and she asked me out 3 times in the last month. Each time, I couldn't go (ie: work/ family commitments). I asked her out on my coming up next days off. I'm so scared!! I've been single for years, but she gives me butterflies."
AmItheAsshole,fffbtv0,t3_et9b7g,1579880515.0,"NTA First, congratulations! Secondly, I've miscarried too and would never think of telling someone not to share their pregnancy experience. She can unfollow you if she isn't healed enough. 

Giving birth was actually quite wonderful. You got this!"

AskReddit,ffcenlr,t3_esse9d,1579797828.0,"Many years ago, I was rejecting my first kidney transplant. The rejection was brutal on my body and my heart was struggling from all the toxins in my body. I was admitted into the hospital for almost a week. One day, my heart started to give out and the nurse gave me these drops under my tongue to stop a heart attack. This medicine gave me the worse headache I've ever had. My hospital roommate (in her 80's), who was there for severe hip pain, got up and sat next to me. She began to pet my head and sing softly to me until I fell asleep. I never forgot her kindness. She was suffering herself, and yet she helped me more that day then I could have ever asked for. I'll never forget her.

Update: Thank you for the upvotes. My guess is she isn't here anymore, but  I'm so glad I talked about her. Reddit can be amazing.

Update 2: Thank you kind stranger for the silver!"

AskReddit,ffc6s56,t3_esps5n,1579792854.0,"My roommate started getting sick. It's looking like she probably has ovarian cancer (she's in her 60's). I'm afraid she won't make it, because of how harsh the stats are on surviving. She's one of my favorite people in the world and I don't to know what life is like without her in it."
