2. The driver’s going at what looks like 40mph at most in the daytime. He chose to continue driving without slowing down up until the moment he’s near the person crossing (even if it’s illegally) and chose to cut it close out of entitlement. He should of seen what was happening since way back and slowed down and then he can do whatever he wants with getting angry and shouting at people for causing him inconvenience that his little retard heart desires.

Even if the pedestrian was j-walking and even if it was their dog without a leash, you still can’t just hit them. People inconvenience others and cut off other people sometimes. That’s just what happens when you live in a world with other people present. If you can’t control your emotions when someone cuts you off that you need to go assault them and any bystander that calls you out, you’re honestly just defective trash that needs to be taken out of the world."
