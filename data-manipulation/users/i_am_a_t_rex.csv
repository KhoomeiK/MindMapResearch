YouShouldKnow,ffgwgst,t1_ffgt2tq,1579916815.0,"With a civil engineering associates degree, most firms I've worked for would happily bring you on board. They usually start people like you in a field position, and put you on a fast track to an office position. You could always stay in the field if you prefer it."

YouShouldKnow,ffg4sxa,t1_fffyprz,1579898464.0,"I've worked in both Pennsylvania and Texas, starting pay for instrument operators without experience was between $12-$15/hr. If you can make party chief, the pay would jump to $20/hr. With experience at party chief it could top $25/hr."
YouShouldKnow,ffffn9v,t3_etb1wx,1579882923.0,"I got in to land surveying in a similar way. Civil engineering firms hire survey field crews, no experience needed. In a year or two you can be making $40k+, and if you pursue licensing, it's not out of the question to make six figures."

steelers,fdpo4hf,t1_fdpe0h7,1578634318.0,"Spot on. I've said it before, we're a better team because we play them twice a year, and they're good because they play us twice a year. I'd rather us play a team of their caliber twice every year than do what the Patriots did for the past two decades: beat up three shitty franchises on their way to the playoffs. Not to take anything away from the Patriots (they are the true GOAT franchise) but when we make the playoffs, we know we earned it.

As an added bonus: When we play Baltimore in the playoffs you know that shit is on."

steelers,fc4fxi7,t1_fc4f3i5,1577415506.0,I agree. Part of the reason we're consistently good is because they're consistently good and vice versa. You gotta beat the best to be the best.
