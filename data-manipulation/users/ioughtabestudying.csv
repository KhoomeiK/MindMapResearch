Dentistry,ffqhv9h,t1_ffqhbal,1580135035.0,"I'm going to have to say this is as far as I can go with advice. If it just *feels* numb and swollen, that's normal and it can take a couple of hours for the local anesthesia to wear off. If there is *visible swelling* that *started after the appointment*, contact the clinic. They know the details of what procedure was done and which materials and medicines were used."

Dentistry,ffniwh3,t1_ffmcbk5,1580066504.0,"Dude, I have the recipe for ultimate night water for you. No need to look further.

In the morning, fill a water bottle half way full and place it in the freezer on its side (careful while placing it in the freezer: the water shouldn't reach the cap). Before going to bed, fill it all the way up with water (i.e. now it's half ice, halff water). Enjoy your ultimate night water.

Options: place the water/ice bottle in the fridge to make sure it stays perfect, or alternately freeze a full bottle and take it out of the freezer into room temperature for the night.

Additional pro move: have a rotating set of two bottles, so that one is in the freezer while the other is in use"
