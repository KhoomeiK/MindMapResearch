AskReddit,ffpy67i,t3_eufui5,1580110562.0,"I was in and out of “affairs” for the last year or so. It’s always the guy’s fault somehow. Then I realised, the only common thing these guys have is - me. I had to take a seat back and evaluate. I was the problem; I wasn’t ready (went through a horrible 4 years relationship before) and I didn’t take the time to purge my negative feelings I had towards my ex so I passed it on to the next guy and the next and the next.

I was the toxic one. I’m learning how to deal with my shit first rather than unloading it on someone else."

Sit on things that doesn’t look like it could hold their weight. My mind is boggled by how they catculate the danger in whatever they do.

Apparently my cat followed him everywhere and was always looking for a way to be pet. As usual. She’s that way when she’s at home too - I don’t have any privacy, even when I’m pooping. If I close the door she’ll meow as if I have abandon her. Ugh. 

Note: she’s a stray by the way, probably the reason why she’s that way"

askwomenadvice,ffhldof,t3_etcii2,1579940746.0,"I’m gonna take a different approach to this:

I’m athletic, ok looking woman with straight dark hair - I checked all the boxes of what my ex wants in a woman. We broke up after 3 years dating each other, it was mutual. 

A year after, he started dating a girl that is nothing like his type - a bit chubby, on the shorter side, wear glasses. I was a former flight attendant with an airline in South East Asia, so I have close friends that are also flight attendant. 

The new girlfriend started bashing me - how do I know? Apparently we share a few mutual friends, one of which is a guy I frequently hang out with. She even posted a few “quotes” how smart girls are bla bla bla bla - probably poking fun at the way me and my friends dressed because we are what she deemed as “plastic bimbo biatches”. 

How do I feel about her insecurity? It is sad. And made her look pathetic. I don’t know what has gotten into her head, I didn’t know this girl from Adam&Eve, so lets just say I didn’t get the resentment she harbours against me. For what? Because I used to date your boyfriend? It was years ago.

However my ex and I are still on good terms - meaning, we wish each other on festive seasons and birthday. Things like that. Or when we happen to bump into each other. I’m always careful to not post anything of me and him after we broke up because I wanted to respect his (future) relationship. 

At the rate his girlfriend is going with bashing me (and my friends), it started really getting on some of my friends nerves for being dragged into this petty drama. Sometimes I feel like reaching out and shaking her out of whatever stupor she’s in and asking “girl, what the hell? Stop caring about his past - I’m not a threat. You’re a threat to your own relationship.”"

Feeling down? Log some miles to get many inspiration.

Depressed? Maybe do a short 3 miles to get the sad void out of my chest.

Day’s ruined? It’s alright - nothing endorphin from a run can’t fix

But I’m alright - because he’s the sweetest vet ever. My cats used to be nervous visiting vet, but after I switch to him, my cats basically behave like Toroman. 

All because the vet talks to them all the time.

“Ash, Poppy! Look at you two cuties!” Proceed to perform a check up.

“Oh Poppy, you’re getting quite big. Look at this belly!”  **pet,pet,pet**

Let me just tell you something - Poppy is a cranky cat most of the time. But with the vet? I swear she loves him more than me, her own hooman."
