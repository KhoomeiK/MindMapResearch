I have a port that I access myself, a surgically placed feeding tube, and more due to multiple complex chronic illnesses that also bring spontaneous joint dislocations, intestinal failure, and more. I'm very educated on new medical technologies and I (am very proud to) have a chemist friend working on bioluminescent dyes for different tissues to help surgeons get cleaner margins. Look at robotic laparoscopic procedures or the new triple-combo drug cocktail for Cystic Fibrosis. Why label something impossible; it only kills ambition and hope."

I just don't have social media accounts to go check her history and was hoping to hear some quotes. I only know of her as ""the actress from The Good Place with EDS"" because I also have EDS. Just googled and found screenshots... Including photos of her smashing scales with a sledgehammer? As well as bashing an elimination diet, which is sometimes abused, but is a medical diagnostic tool. Wow.

ETA: looking thru the ""I Weigh"" Instagram campaign I'm having a hard time finding anything to criticize other than the disgust for the scale (which is an important health diagnostic) Everything seems to be self acceptance and love, which can be the first steps towards a healthier lifestyle. That seems net positive to me?"

But I don't think it's unreasonable to expect a friend to kindly and patiently hear about my hospital stay or recent procedure in the same way they would expect me to kindly and patiently listen about their business trip.

Context: I've hEDS/Mast Cell/Dysautonomia/etc. Port for TPN/antihistamine/hydration, Jtube for venting/meds, likely swapping PRN NG's for a peg sometime. Fairly global sublux/dislocations, w/bracing and power chair.

I live half-in and half-out of the medical world and perhaps my standards are too high. I don't feel like I should censor myself to mildly boost others' comfort, as I still see that as me carrying the emotional labor. (Don't light yourself on for to warm someone else) That isn't me saying I toss out gore and details constantly or to those I know don't appreciate such talk. Additionally, if someone is noticably uncomfortable with a specific thing or they request non-medical talk, a topic change is not a problem. I'm just unwilling to change my natural social interactions to avoid half my life in order to prevent mild social discomfort."
fatlogic,fdqivgn,t1_fdpu8kt,1578667760.0,"Just to provide a cousin story that isn't ""fine"" since I've heard this justification a lot in my ...ahem... hometown circles.

Smoking during pregnancy can have significant long term effects. Have a cousin with a gaggle of kids, it was apparent one of the pregnancies his wife smoked kinda heavily all the way through... Low birth weight, weak cries, and still smaller-for-age than the other kids (4-5 years). Vices are hard, but it really sucks to see the consequences.

TL;DR: Don't smoke while pregnant. Is bad."

At most, you might get scolded for nosing into other accounts (don't do that, patron records are PRIVATE always). It's a simple fix with the right permissions in the catalog. (Especially if you're running Sierra/Millennium) It was an accident, don't freak out... Just come clean. These little 'oops' when covered up or obscured can cause frustration down the road for patrons and workers alike."
AskReddit,fdka6q3,t1_fdjrawq,1578499549.0,"In 2019, I have had to come to terms with the fact that had I not had proper intervention or if the treatments (TPN, IV nutrition via central line) stop, I will die slowly of malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances. My intestines no longer absorb nutrients or move properly due to hEDS/Mast Cell Activation/Dysautonomia/MTHFR/etc on top of the rest of my rare/chronic illnesses. It's been a change from my ""old not live-threatening"" illnesses to my ""new potentially deadly"" disability.

From Oct 2018-Sept 2019, I starved. From healthy to ""severely malnourished"" despite feeding tubes, formulas, and IV hydration and vitamins. I reacted by throwing myself into researching diagnostics and treatments. Now, I'm sharing more with my friends and honestly... The biggest change is I'm no longer 'making people comfortable' with my illnesses and putting on the 'inspirational sick' face. I'm struggling with this and I will struggle with it till I'm dead (perks of a genetic disease) and my loved ones will have to make their own peace with it. 'Cause eventually I'm not gonna be here to lift that for everybody.

Thanks if you made it this far. That was kinda therapeutic to write out. 
TL;DR: I'm in ""Intestinal Failure"" and will starve (even if eating) without daily intensive treatment. Coping went like this: 1 Furious research 2 Crying with husband 3 Deciding to value my feelings as highly as those of others 4 Sharing what my life will look like with them 5...???

fatlogic,fdjm7ky,t1_fdgx9vb,1578477616.0,"Just a warning: I took Topamax for migraines several years ago. It made me so mentally foggy I had literal 'lag' (like a video game) answering questions as simple as ""What's your date of birth?"" I couldn't tell. I was aware I was a bit off, but not that I was 'impaired' despite being an otherwise good self-moderator (medical stuff makes me faint, among others) A friend who took it for seizures accidentally drove to the next town over in a daze trying to get home from a friend's house.

I really, really hope you don't have these side effects but when consumed with alcohol they increase dramatically. Drank (mildly) twice while on it and it made me terrifically ill. I did lose about 20lbs (involuntarily, from a healthy weight), due to lack of appetite and forgetting to eat, but that wasn't our goal in prescribing so I switched meds. Maybe present the issue and see what options the doc suggests? Perhaps they can suggest a better fit pharmacologically. 

I don't want to discourage, but remember the fearing for my friend's safety driving when she was so out of it. We both wish someone would have warned us to look for these things; please keep this in mind as you potentially start a new medication! I genuinely hope you never see a side effect and find something that works well for you!"

It's bad for you because you're relying on overstretched tendons to hold the joint in place which causes extra wear'n'tear. This might eventually lead to an injury or if sudden excess force is applied while hyperextended, but each hyperextension isn't a break.

Source: have hypermobility disorder, if every hyperextension caused a break I'd have broken nearly all of my joints by now... many times over."
