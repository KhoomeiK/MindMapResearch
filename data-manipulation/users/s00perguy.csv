I've accidentally dropped, kicked, and slammed this phone into things many times so far, and the worst damage it has to date is a few scratches. the lack of a headphone jack is what I'd laughably call my one major complaint, but I've since learned that BT earbuds aren't the WORST thing ever, despite my extreme early reservations. I distinctly remember it being a massive disappointment when I hadn't checked the specs for it before buying. Now, I could honestly care less.

All in all, I predict I'll actually get pretty emotional giving up this phone when its time finally comes. Until then, Pixel 2XL forever!"

She's doing the capitalist thing and just taking her money elsewhere. On a base level, I can respect this, honestly."
