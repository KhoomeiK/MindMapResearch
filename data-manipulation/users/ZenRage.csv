Not to mention, it would be impossible to move him and he himself would probably not survive.

I added a report line to this effect after we repeatedly failed an evacuation drill because one of our admins was just so large that she blocked the stairwell and took a minute to walk DOWN a flight of stairs. She just blocked everyone behind her.  In a real fire, she and everyone behind her would die of smoke inhalation.

I took a lot of heat for that until I pointed out that we usually failed when she was present, but usually succeeded in our evacuations when she was out. (Which was frequently enough to have ample comparsion data.)

You on your own time are free to exercise your civil liberties as you like.

A police officer on duty owes his employer honest services, so he needs to be doing his job.  His job is not surveilling law abiding citizens broadly (there are exceptions but narrow ones) and reporting him for doing so is appropriate: ideally ask him to take a report on himself while taking a video and then follow up with his employer to see it was filed."

Whose laws are they?  The laws are the Federal government's laws.  They have jealously guarded their federal authority here and said that states DO NOT have immigration authority. It is the job of Federal agents to enforce these laws.
