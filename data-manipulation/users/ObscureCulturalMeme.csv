There are several variant historical spellings of his name, but none that look like Ghazzali (in English).  Edit:  al-Ghazzali was a different famous scholar, about 200 years later, but more in philosophy and law, not math and astronomy.

It's every category of damage at once.

Way back in the day, your resistance to a particular category of magic damage could play a major part of a fight.  And when interrupting or being interrupted, all abilities of that entire category would be locked out for several seconds.

In later expansions, they came up with new categories that were combinations of the original seven.  If I hit you with Plague damage, then you use either your Shadow or Nature resistance, whichever is *lower* (good for me).  If you interrupt me during that cast, you'll lock out either my Shadow spells *or* my Nature spells, but I can immediately start casting that Plague damage again.

The full list of categories is https://wow.gamepedia.com/Magic_schools and these days it almost doesn't matter.  Physical is special because it's countered by armor instead of resistance.  Holy is special because there's almost zero sources of holy resistance."

So, Lord of the Rings time:

In-universe, the language that everyone's talking (when not speaking something specific to a species) is not English, but ""Westron"", a sort of generic ""Common Speech"" language.  And the book that Bilbo, Frodo, and Sam all write is in that language; what you and I buy is Tolkien's translation, har har, into English.

In the appendices we see more of Arwen and Aragorn's backstory, basically all the conversations they had on screen.  And whether they're speaking Westron or Sindarin (everyday elvish), the English ""translation"" invariably has them speaking to one another with *thee* and *thou* in private conversation.

Also, the dialect of Westron spoken by the hobbits kept the informal/personal form but not the formal one.  So when Meriadoc gets to Rohan and speaks that way to Theoden, everyone was like awwww, he's rough and rustic, he'll fit in fine....

...but when Peregrin gets to Minas Tirth and speaks that way to Lord Fucking Denethor, who *didn't* immediately have him thrown in chains, people in the city figured that Pippin must therefore be *of equal social rank* to the Steward... and so as he walks around the city, Pippin is saluted and bowed to, and addressed respectfully as the Prince of the Halflings."
