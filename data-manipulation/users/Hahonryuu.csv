TheGamer,ff29orp,t1_ff22z16,1579497958.0,"Intelligence is essentially capacity to store knowledge and ability to learn/memorize information while wisdom was more about decision making. Those are the non-RPG parts of it.

&#x200B;

Thing is, average human stats are around 5-10 and anything higher than that is above average. His WIS is over 120. While it might not seem like it next to his INT, it is VERY high. Far above normal people. The fact that people still act like he has low WIS or the like is just silly. The problem being that the writer can't write someone smarter than himself, that's why his decisions sometimes seem shaky, but that wont change even if he had 5000 WIS because the writer wont change and has decided what his ""character"" is. And again, ""decision making"" ability is something thats difficult to measure, similarly to him being ""lucky"". Thus it really should be taken off the table when discussing the usefulness of a stat.

&#x200B;

Thus the only other things we CAN look at are the RPG like properties WIS gives, which is magic defense and Mana Regeneration. Both of which really aren't an issue for him and, is thus, a waste.

&#x200B;

Lastly, think about the stat boosting items we've seen him make. They all have some sort of restriction on them basically saying ""Jihans stats are too damn big for this item to help him"". This means that, by keeping WIS and LUK relatively low, he can more easily create a piece of equipment to buff them, thus giving all of you delusional people the WIS/LUK bonuses you so misguidedly want."
TheGamer,ff1wl58,t1_ff1vagp,1579487827.0,"That's not an answer. Wisdom does basically nothing for him. 

&#x200B;

Mana Regen? It's already godly for him

&#x200B;

Magic defense? He already has lots of defensive spells. In the beginning he was always worried about his own safety and he doesn't comment much on that anymore, so clearly he feels safe. 

&#x200B;

Decision making? We can't really quantify that. His decisions will always be what the author feels like. Plus his Wisdom is already much higher than a normal persons and he still feels like INT is the way to go.

&#x200B;

Are you talking about actually balancing his stats? Because thats how you make a gimped character. Especially when you invest in a stat thats not doing anything for you, as I pointed out above."

I mean, that's a lie, he's the MC and would have been fine regardless of his choices, but from an actual RPG stand point and not taking him being the MC into account, reversing his INT and WIS would have been god awful.

&#x200B;

You're correct on what WIS does (purely regen and magic defense, no actual mana pool increase) and would indeed cripple him on the amount of spells he can cast at once + the upper limit of high tier spells he can cast at all (his INT buffs have reduced mana costs by 99% on top of him just having an insane MP pool)

&#x200B;

You are correct on what INT does, it effects the strength of his spells, thus having low INT and high WIS gives him a ton of regen and magic resist, and absolutely 0 offense. 

&#x200B;

You are also correct on Luck and its risks and why its questionable to pump points into it. And I hadn't even thought of other peoples luck, or even just meticulous planning really, could affect his own luck. You can't just have a high luck and expect things to work out. look at the 300 luck blondie. his luck at 300 is considered insane AND can ""shape destiny"" or whatever and look what happened when we first met him...Jihan friggin nuked him and he even lost an arm/leg (or both) iirc. His ""Luck"" there was probably him surviving. Anmd thats just ontop of the other problems with his luck that you already mentioned. This shows Luck will NOT be an infinite ""I win"" button Jihan can just keep using and needs more tangible and measurable power.

&#x200B;

I mentioned in another comment (actually, I mention things like this basically EVERY time someone makes a 'I think eh should be focusig on other stats"" post/comment) on this post that him having them ""low"" like this means he can actually increase them with equipment/potions. He can't do it for his INT or mana because they are all astronomically high. Every stat boosting item we've seen him make either has a level restriction or a restriction on how high a stat it will work for. Keeping them in the 100 range like this means he can just craft a wisdom and a luck item and bring them basically on par with his physical stats without having to actually invest points into them. all of the power, none of the waste

&#x200B;

Glad there's at least one other person on this subreddit who is actually looking at how things work."
TheGamer,ff1g78w,t1_fep8x2e,1579478721.0,FOR WHAT BRO?
TheGamer,ff1g64o,t1_fesv25w,1579478707.0,"Plus, eh already has plenty of plot armor. And lets be real here, his luck isn't really low. It just looks that way because his INT is so overpowering. Dude has no low stats."
TheGamer,ff1g10q,t1_fep7uzg,1579478645.0,"Well it sounds like your stance is pretty set and you don't care what other shave to say, so I wont bother wasting my time outside of a ""you're wrong"" and call it a day."
TheGamer,ff1ei6x,t3_eq9ghn,1579478183.0,"I feel like everyone complaining about this has the wrong mind set

&#x200B;

For starters, everything you guys think wisdom will do for him outside mana regen (which eh doesn't need) and magic resist (which he also doesn't REALLY need) is pure speculation. Plus we only saw what high luck does recently. Secondly, remember when he first got his powers? Normal people have stats in the single digits and MAYBE have one in the 10-20 range if they are particularly good at something. Even class prez had an INT of, what, 29? And she was considered super smart and had perfect grades.

&#x200B;

Jihan has over 120 wisdom, FAR above normal and he STILL believes putting points into INT is the correct choice. Basically, he's wiser than any of you and still isn't pumping it. I don't think pumping WIS is as hot as you think it is. So stop sucking WIS dick =/

&#x200B;

Next, remember how when he crafts items, he can't benefit form any of them because his INT and mana are too high? Keeping WIS and Luck relatively low (again, they ARE high) means its much easier for him to invest into boosting items for them, meaning he can get them fairly high. His INT on the other hand can ONLY be increased manually at this point, so he may as well do that. 

&#x200B;

Also keep ion mind that whole blondie was given tangible luck benefits, Jihan is the MC and will always be as lucky/unlucky as the author wants. It's meta, but investing into luck is pointless. But of course its also potentially a bad thing to invest in because of the equipment point I brought in above plus...

&#x200B;

Lastly, we don't know if there is a max level, and spreading your points around to other fairly useless stats is not how you properly min-max. Not to say he hasn't definitely made mistakes, but he's clearly been focused on his ""build"" since he's come to terms with his powers. If he can level indefinitely, then yeah sure, eventually there's gonna be a point where you just think ""I don't think INT is doing anything for you anymore"" and start putting it in other places. But if there IS a max level, even if its a soft cap, then putting his points into other places is a fruitless venture and a waste of points.

&#x200B;

And FYI, high mana would still be needed because it doesn't matter if you regen infinity mana per second if you come across a spell you don't have the mana to cast. Not to mention your spells have no punch because you put everything into regen and defense instead of offense. Where as the rout he took gives him massive mana reserves AND high regen AND high attack AND high defense (because of his INT and mana feeding his defense spells). You say Luck would give him exponential growth in wealth, but thats based on nothing, plus he has infinite money already...Like, thats a problem that I have with the ""he should be putting more into other stats"" group is that y'all are trying to solve"" problems that literally do not exist."

And probably more. I mean, this is hardly the first time that one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood starred in a shitty movie."
movies,fe8myrr,t1_fe8f3g0,1578928106.0,My favorite way of getting people to shut their moutha wben they hate on the idea of remakes for crap reasons is just to inform them that Scarface is a remake. You aren't allowed to be a wannabe  cinephile elitist and hate Scarface. Its in their contract.
movies,fe8mbrg,t1_fe862dm,1578927867.0,"Bro

For starters, hollywood has been doing remakes FOREVER. They will never stop because its their main thing aside from...

Secondly, its based off a book so its an adaptation, which hollywood has been doing LONGER than forever.

There is nothing inherently wrong with either of these things. 

Instead of being irrationally angry at the idea of remakes and adaptations, why not just be angry at poorly made movies in general and stop worrying over the source materal?"

As for it being the way it always was/is, how the hell does that justify it being good/not broken? It used to be that using leeches for basically everything in medicine was the way it always was...but it was broken and eventually phased out. Something existing or being a certain way doesn't somehow justify it in any way. That is some pretty backwards logic."

whowouldwin,fe6em5b,t3_entjbd,1578888613.0,"I'm going to assume that, despite having worn the robes and gone on a mission for them, Sasuke doesn't count? Cuz if he does, he kinda wins if its prime Sasuke since prime Sasuke is literally the second strongest living ninja in the world, and the gap between him and  #3 (whoeover that is) is basically as vast as the ocean =/

How important is the ""standing"" part of ""last man standing alive""...because if its not that important then Hidan >\_>

&#x200B;

I know who it WONT be...Deidara. Suicidal little fucker is probably the first to die, whether by his means or the enemies.

&#x200B;

Kishimoto clearly hates women and Sasori was beaten by women, so Sasori is therefore a punk (as well as the first Akatsuki member defeated) and will definitely lose this.

&#x200B;

Most ninjutsu seems pretty worthless vs a Kisame who's actually putting effort into his fight, so Itachi might be the only one who can fight him.

&#x200B;

Konan is a woman, so it can't be her.

&#x200B;

Zetsu has basically no impressive battle prowess so, he's out.

&#x200B;

Kakuzu seems good enough to at least make other top contenders work for it a bit. I don't think he'll WIN but, he wont commit suicide, isn't a woman, and wasn't beaten by women/ His only flaw is that he's ninjutsu based and Kisame exists.

&#x200B;

Itachi's prolly the only one equipped to fight Kisame and his chakra eating ability, and is just otherwise pretty high tier among this group. But he has low stamina.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming Hidan can't just cheese this and win by default, I guess it comes down to a few things. 

&#x200B;

ITACHI: its making sure he has the stamina to fight as much as necessary vs everyone else AND be able to tsukuyomi Kisame. 

&#x200B;

KISAME: it's...well, not getting tsukuyomi'd and eating the chakra for Deidaras big explosion where he spreads his chakra over everything and everyone and Sasuke only dodged because he sucked Kishimotos di- I mean instantly summoned Manda, hopped in his mouth, and desummoned Manda (and himself), all while not having much chakra left. Cuz he's basically the only one aside Itachi who can prolly stop Deidara from doing that. 

&#x200B;

DEIDARA: I guess probably wont WIN since he'll die (or, I guess, hand Hidan the win or something, iunno), but he can force a draw/Hidan win. Unless you dictate deidara the winner if he successfully mercs everyone, even if he dies in the process.

&#x200B;

HIDAN:  needs to basically hope Deidara does his thing or he has no hope. I'm only even mentioning him because it's a fight to the death lol.

&#x200B;

KAKUZU: his only hope probably is Kisame being down, Itachi too low on stamina to beat him, and Deidaras explosion was successfully thwarted.

&#x200B;

Kisame is probably all around the most ""powerful"", Itachi the most skills and has the biggest bag of tricks to look into, Deidara is a WoMD, Hidan is immortal, and Kakuzu is (not counting Kisame literally eating your stamina away) probably one of the more tiring ones to fight against.

&#x200B;

One of these 5 will be the winner. The others not named in this section are just there to be an annoyance to these guys or they get lucky and steal the win from someone else somehow without actually ""earning"" it (I day knowing full well its impossible for Hidan to actually EARN a victory here.)

&#x200B;

Actually, you know what, i'll give credit to Zetsu and Konan in 1 single way...if nobody actually STOP Deidara, Zetsu can hide way way underground and Konan can fly away (though probably not fast enough, i'll give her benefit of the doubt) so, I guess one of them could scum a win as well thanks to Deidara. Man, so many people are counting on that guy!"

They don't suck because they were ordered to suck, they suck because they aren't allowed to score a lethal hit on an MC ever.
