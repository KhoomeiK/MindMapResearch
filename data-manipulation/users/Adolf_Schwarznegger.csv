MetalMemes,fdmtp3e,t1_fdmtj28,1578565296.0,"Nice. It's one of my favourites all across the board, but as a swede I am kind of biased lol. On another note, I'm pretty sure they don't classify themselves as ""viking metal"", but rather just melo-death. Have a good one man"
MetalMemes,fdmtdqq,t1_fdlr8bt,1578564862.0,Awesome band! Amon Amarth remains my favourite though
MetalMemes,fdkmh3p,t1_fdklrk0,1578506614.0,"I am usually not fond of the more brutal end of death metal and especially not slamming, but i'll give em a chance. Yeah you're right about that rule of thumb, have a good one."
MetalMemes,fdkl2dd,t1_fdkkl8s,1578505773.0,I just realized I based my opinion of them on a single terrible song and just assumed all of them sounded like that. (Kill your mother and rape your dog). I retract my statement and will listen to them more to see what I think. Thanks for keeping it civilized when I was blatantly wrong.
MetalMemes,fdkknev,t1_fdk36ik,1578505567.0,I bet you get mad when people tell you ghost isnt metal

MetalMemes,fdkilqw,t1_fdkgxed,1578504553.0,Death metal is my favourite genre. It just seems like extremely low effort and no complexoty at all. It's just mindless shouting and repetitive instruments in my ears
MetalMemes,fdjtwew,t1_fdjtibt,1578487339.0,I dont underatand how anyone can enjoy dying fetus. It genuinely baffles me
wholesomememes,fdjtmrj,t1_fdjqyl0,1578487073.0,Love that song
wholesomememes,fdjtik4,t1_fdjq1yg,1578486956.0,"Hell yeah, love death atlas"
wholesomememes,fdjthui,t1_fdjp3ju,1578486937.0,"Listening to them ruined a lot of bands for me, they just pale in comparison. They are one of my favourites."
wholesomememes,fdjtf5h,t1_fdjoxzs,1578486861.0,"Amon amarth, In Flames (older stuff), Dark Tranquility, Kalmah, and on a slightly less melodic note: Gojira. The way of all flesh and From Mars to sinius are great albums of theirs."
FallenOrder,f88fiw6,t3_dzdkkv,1574353815.0,"PC, would love one!"
