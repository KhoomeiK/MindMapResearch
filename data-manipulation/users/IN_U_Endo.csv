> Jobs was impatient and in a bad mood one day in 1984 when a Bay Area policeman pulled him over for going more than 100 mph in a 55-mph zone. Although the cop warned him he'd go to jail if he was caught speeding again, Jobs honked at him and told him to hurry up writing the ticket. As soon as the cop left, Jobs immediately accelerated to 100 mph again. Said his companion at the time, ""He absolutely believed that the normal rules didn't apply to him."""

I figured out that my issue was a crossover. Basically, cold water was being allowed into the hot water side. This was caused by a faulty mixing valve. To find it, first I shut the water tank off completely and made sure the feed line to it was turned off. I then went into my kitchen and turned the faucet on hot to relieve pressure. After doing this, every single faucet in the house had to be shut off from underneath, as well as the laundry room. I still had the leak so I went into my bathtub and took apart the diverter. My shower has a delta central diverter control system...its got 1 knob and nothing else. The face plate came off simple enough and when I looked at the pipes, I couldnt locate a shut off screw that these things usually come with. So I thought about it, every single faucet in the house is shut off except for this one, it must be the cartridge. I shut the main water to the house off, took out the cartridge, ran out to home depot, paid $50 for a replacement, reinstalled and turned the main back on. It worked! The faulty cartridge was allowing cold water to leak into the hot water side throughout the entire house.

Last night I went outside because I heard a noise like running water from a faucet. Next to the outdoor spigot is a pipe that is connected to the top side of my water heater (natural gas, 40gal) via a hose. This was leaking out water for the better part of the day at about 1 gallon every 5 minutes from what I could tell. Thinking there could be something wrong with the heater I went to the controls and shut it off then manually shut the gas off to it too. There is a valve on some pipes that come from the wall into the heater (see picture), so I shut that off thinking its the water feed line(maybe?). Now, at this point my brain is telling me that there should be nothing coming out of the hot water side of the faucets inside my house, but there is....at the same rate of 1 gallon every 5 minutes. I closed all the faucets and wanted to see what would happen, so then I went back to the garage and noticed the heater was draining water via that pipe that leads outside, at the same rate of 1 gal @5 min.

I called a plumber and explained my situation, he tells me I need a new heater so he can do it for $1600. The problem is that my heater has been replaced within the past 5 years so im not sure its that. So, can anyone give me some hints?
