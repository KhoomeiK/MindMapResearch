Constantly talking, and talking over people doesn't just go away with observation.  There are a *lot* of adults with this problem, and it's one that gets addressed in social skills classes for children specifically because it's such an undesirable, offputting trait.  They're *specifically taught* not to constantly chatter at people, because their parents were unsuccessful at teaching them and they're struggling to just intuitively pick it up.

Edit: This can often cascade into larger problems too, such as dealing with the emotional fallout of peer rejection without never knowing *why*, because no one taught them.

Some lessons are hurtful to some children, and there's often not a lot that can be done about it.  The  relatively small hurt of being told to not talk so much can save the much bigger hurt of peer and romantic rejection do to undesirable traits that now are even harder to fix than they would have been as children.  Think of it as a social vaccine, a shot and a sore arm instead of the flu.

Of course, *how* you do that matters, and the comic above is a good example of how not to do it.  But unlikable traits only get more cemented in with time."

There's too many variables.  Women's sports should stay as it is (ya know, for *women*), rather than restructure everything to accommodate a fraction of trans athletes that can compete in the open divisions instead.

Lots of people can't compete for lots of reasons.  That's life.  You have to look to the overall big picture to keep the sport competitive for the people it was actually meant for in the first place.

Allowing bio men to compete is unfair to bio women.  They don't need to be the ones to pay because of male entitlement."
