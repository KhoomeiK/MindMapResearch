nottheonion,fff0zhg,t1_ffez2ji,1579872683.0,"Honestly I am not the guy to explain it. I haven't ever seen a truly simple explanation of what QE is or what it means to the banks, the governments or the wider population.

To answer though, yes it does effect the value of the currency. The effective value of your currency goes down when you use QE, as you're making money from thin air and reducing the value of the entire currency in circulation as a result.

The new money is, as far as I can tell, as a repayment for the debts they hold from the governments. However the government probably hugely overpaid on the debt and the purchasing of bonds for inflated amounts is a tool to help the value of the currency recover from the creation of the cash in the first place.

The cash was intended to recapitalise the banks so the transfer of funds between banks and individuals could continue, however they mostly put it aside to service their own debts and to give themselves a larger buffer against further losses.

It's not simple by any means."
nottheonion,ffep5r7,t1_ffen8a7,1579858415.0,"QE is basically what us mere plebians would call 'printing a fuck load of money', except it works differently in that the money isn't even printed but a man at a desk simply decides to will a certain amount of money into existence then that is given directly to the banks.

The banks are somehow meant to make this trickle down to us, or something.

It defies true explanation because in reality its nothing more than a numbers game played by governments and the bankers for the benefit of themselves.

People that skip a job every year are job hoppers, that can't be deputed. I was thinking more of a three year cycle, which allows for progression however that comes yet avoids stagnating in one position for too long.

It's certainly a difficult balancing act and it all depends on your industry and contacts if it works or not. My own industry is light on people and skill heavy so it works well."
