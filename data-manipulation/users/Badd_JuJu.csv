It's probably my biggest weakness- failing to remember I can do whatever the hell I want. I get so stuck in the idea of needs needing to be ""this"" way that I forget that there's no rule saying that, barring changing ""this way"" causing weakening of the story (but even then, if that's the story you want to tell, tell it)."

Which, I get it, means we have to spend more time in the game generating more resources, but at some point, it gets to be too much. Shaders is that point."

DestinyTheGame,ffm5htl,t1_ffkg6fq,1580048753.0,"I love Gears' gameplay from the 3rd game onward, as I felt like I got significantly smoother after that, but it's nowhere near Destiny. The only game I can think of that feels so good to just shoot is Overwatch."
DestinyTheGame,ffjtdvk,t1_ffhkqta,1580006426.0,"I still maintain that there has never been a better, more refined, or satisfying shooter from a gunplay standpoint. Destiny is #1 far and away, and the next ones, while still great, aren't even close.

The gameplay mechanics of this game are just incredible. In what other games can I fly over 20 enemies heads', raining bullets down on them, dodging incoming fire while still in air, shooting fireballs down into enemies, and then summon a sword that turns the entire place into Pompeii? All in like, 10 seconds?"

AskReddit,ff305xv,t1_ff2qutt,1579530103.0,"The person has to want to get help as well. I'm currently in a similar situation with one of my closest friends. He's become absolutely impossible to be around the past year. He had a shitty childhood so I tried to be understanding and the brother he never got to have (he's even acknowledged me as such in a drunken rant) but after a while I got tired of saying the same things and listening to the same problems.

After a while, if you don't make an effort to fix the issues, you're now at fault for them. Wallowing in self pity and drinking is not a cure, even for just the symptoms. Too many people solely resort to this.

He and I were talking alongside another close friend of ours who's been there for him for years (neither of us really ever get acknowledged that way) and all of the conversations kept coming back to us being assholes one way or another, even bringing up comments from years ago. I got tired of being told we're assholes when we've been spending time and money trying to help him, so I showed him what me being an asshole really was.

I told him (admittedly, in a much harsher tone) to grow up and leave holding grudges against friends in high school because its not healthy to latch on to inane comments made in the heat of the moment and let it affect you for years. I told him we've done nothing but offer our time and money to try to get him the help he needs (he can't afford it) and we don't even want a thank you for it, we just want him to get his shit together, but he doesn't want to help himself, so there's nothing we can do anymore.

I then told him to tell me what he wants to do when he's ready to figure it out and I left. It's probably the only time I've ever seen him silent."

But forcing these implants into their kids was a common symptom of them rejecting their childrens' deafness as a part of themselves. Some deaf people I know have reflected this sentiment to me, hence where I got the idea."

nfl,fdft5yp,t1_fdfjfk2,1578369573.0,"What this is missing though is that Super Bowls have come in clusters for teams.

The Cowboys of the 70s won 2, and the Cowboys of the 90s won 3.

The 9ers of the 80s and 90s won 5, while the Bills went to 4 straight and the Broncos went to 5, winning 2.

Then the Patriots ""Dynasty"".

I do think fan expectations are kind of inflated but it's not like the Patriots are the only team to win a lot in a small amount of time.

They don't necessarily look down on those who have it, but almost all of the Deaf people I've met have a certain kind of pride in being Deaf.

My main concern though was forcing Deaf children to be oral and refusing to allow them to learn sign, which is somewhat common nowadays, but used to be commonplace up into a few decades ago."
