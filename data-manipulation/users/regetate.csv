I think the way organized religion has fought and divided people is heinous and not the intention of understanding any potential spiritual aspect of the universe 

But I still think there is an underlying not yet understood property that connects us all

As we exist we can only perceive time chronologically

Maybe there are being(s) that experience time differently, things that we cannot directly observe or perceive, it’s a question to entertain no?

People will always find ways to manipulate others for personal gain or ideologies to divide people and drive war even in lieu of religious excuses

That’s all in human nature but I think there is something for us as a species to grasp on to that will allow us to ascend past these base instincts so maybe we can prevent humanity from being a simple ouroboros. Actually come together to improve our understanding of the universe and prevent our own collapse."
clevercomebacks,ff9e6li,t1_ff9c16g,1579711077.0,"I’ll expand on this, potentially a bit excessively, because I think we have mutual understanding: My point here is religion inherently was not meant to explain the natural world despite what people try to pull out of it

The Bible is not and will never be a science text- trying to use creation stories and moral teaching as some sort of explanatory text of all existence is crazy limited to the lens of ancient peoples 

They’re guiding texts for how we should behave in a world under the assumptions that there exists a supernatural element in human connection and we can see every text tinted with historical context and even ulterior motives of the authors at the time

I think they’re meant to be only as tools to develop these guiding connections to the mysterious “something deeper” in the universe

And I find it hard to dismiss its existence due to my own personal experience which you seem to label as inherently falling into the category of “confirmation bias” or “cognitive dissonance” 

Concepts of “This is where we came from” and “be good to your neighbors” are not sentiments at odds no matter how much people try to pit them against one another

[This whole channel](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI) is a great summary for how I personally see the world

I’ve witnessed militant atheists and bible thumpers and all in between and I have to say I really don’t think anyone has it exactly right- including myself

I think if a spiritual element to the universe exists it’s likely entirely beyond human comprehension 

but to me at least, evidence of its essence exists in things deemed evolutionarily illogical: like acts of compassion that possess no benefit to the individual or species as a whole (consider interspecies altruism), and love in all of its complex forms especially platonic love in friendship and selfless acts towards strangers

I think all humans have evolved where our emotions will continue to get more complex and our capacity for intelligence and compassion will expand as we continue on our trajectory- or we will destroy ourselves

We can only grow as a species if we can ascend past the bounds of human flaws of greed, hate, and pettiness and that will take otherworldly cooperation

They’re a rapist and to just allow them to walk away to rack up more victims is enabling them, if it’s a party tell the host, tell other women, call the police, warn people. Even if the drink is spilled you can gather evidence from it, you don’t need much residue to prove presence of drugs.

Like I’m proud she saved that one girl but it’s kinda the bare minimum here, silence kills."

Like great she spilled the drink but sad if he still gets his way. You don’t need to physically confront the person just let someone in authority know, it’s likely that he carries more than one pill/tries this shit regularly-"

Cats are pretty apathetic which lead to experimental conclusions they didn’t possess any mirror recognition which they obviously do

&#x200B;

But the idea here, that the unborn have a right to use their mothers bodily organs but subsequently  lose that right as soon as they are born, how does that make any sense? It doesn't, the woman's right to her body legally trumps anyone else's need to live whether they are a full grown person or a bundle of fetal cells. No one can hook themselves up to you and use you as a life sustaining machine no matter how dire their need."

Who the fuck tries to force a stranger to write them a letter specifically?

&#x200B;

Offenders still have to register all aliases, and places of residence, no? Cause if it was him he most certainly didn't have that identity profile up to date and I personally think he was up to no good given his swift change in tone from friendly to commanding."

There’s a huge difference in emotional maturity and life experience between a person who is independent and a person who is still financially reliant on their family

Yes a journalists job is to report, but what do you need to do to report on something? Develop an understanding through experience and contact multiple professionals to gain various opinions and points of view.

If only PhDs have any say on any subject then everyone has to pour money/ years of narrowly specific study getting a degree to have any level of credibility which is ludicrous.

Spending time learning, living, and researching something can often lend more knowledge than anything offered through academic institutions.

We can’t just dismiss the experience of those we can learn from"

Man told me he just got out of jail and that he had a gf waiting but was lonely and wanted me to write to him. Went on benignly about his conversion to Islam and then turned extremely adamant, almost aggressive that I write to him and “not lie to him” then handed me his address with their new self-given Islamic name.

Well the whole situation made me uncomfortable so I looked up local sex offenders and found an 8yo report of this veeerrry similar looking guy registered as a sex offender with rape charges.

Couldn’t be 100% sure was same person in photo after such a short exchange but I can tell you the name and address given to me was not the one listed for them."
