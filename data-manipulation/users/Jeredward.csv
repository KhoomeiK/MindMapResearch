gaybros,ff8uazq,t1_ff8ggah,1579696334.0,Lily is cool; I like how unapologetically quirky she is.  But you didn’t mention Aimee!  She’s so ridiculously sweet and innocent.  I just want to put her in my pocket and keep her safe all day.
princealbertpiercings,ff53gf6,t1_ff4uj2r,1579579183.0,I have a 10g. That looks smaller...probably 12g.

Not me. I’ve got a shy bladder, but probably you."

AskReddit,few1yb9,t3_eqies2,1579404347.0,"I don’t often remember my dreams, but I did remember this one.  I was at a coworker’s house and we were chatting with a third coworker.  The doorbell rang and we went to see what it was and someone had just left a baby/toddler at her front door.  We didn’t know what to do, so she picked it up and brought it inside and said she was going to take care of it.  In the realm of dreams, not the craziest one I’ve ever had...except I was abruptly woken up from this dream at 6AM by my phone ringing.  It was that coworker.  She needed me to take her morning shift because her older sister unexpectedly dropped off my coworker’s niece (a baby/toddler) and needed her to look after her.  I literally dreamed it moments before or maybe even at the same time that it was happening, plus a little creative license from my imagination.  I agreed to work for her, but was super spooked about my premonition-dream."

funny,feevbih,t1_fedlx0h,1579041994.0,What about...who was the third...Cici Wharhol?
demisexuality,feetaqz,t3_eoofmq,1579040750.0,"Well, I think it’s like asking if being right-handed is common to demisexuals.  Maybe, but it’s purely coincidence and doesn’t really have anything to do with being demisexual.

That being said, it sounds like she might be self-conscious about how she looks.  I don’t like taking photos of myself because I don’t think I’m that photogenic.  She may feel the same about herself.  

Have you considered SnapChat?  Maybe it would ease her anxiety to know that the photo will be deleted mere seconds after it’s seen, and she can gain some confidence while taking some baby steps to get over it."
