One target is on the 2nd floor of the house that overlooks the chopper.  There are two ways up to that floor, the internal and external stairs.  You can approach from the left and try to go up the external stairs or go inside for the internal stair.   Or you can approach from the chopper side either running past the chopper or going through the building on the left and trying to use the cover.   

So, if you just planted the bomb and need to defend it, you want to put trip mines on the two stairs if you can, put a sniper on the roof and split the rest of your team defending the two approach directions.
