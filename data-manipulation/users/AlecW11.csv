Dropped out of education and pushed away my now-ex, cuz I was video gaming too hard. I would have probably kept going, but I got banned off the server I played on, and slowly realized how bad it had been. Now, a couple months later, I refuse to get heavily involved in video games/gaming communities, just cuz of how bad it got. Sometimes you just need a cold turkey. Maybe even forced by someone/something else. I hope you manage to get through to your pal."
