Further more, this is from a battle ground state so political ads are everywhere.  Basketball games, baseball games, football games, things that dads would watch with their kids, especially little boys. 

If the kid has said ""I had a dream that Trump wasn't our president"", then I would agree with you it is too political. Just wanting him to not make fun of people is literally apolitical."
pics,fel4ju4,t1_fel30ke,1579213906.0,"You are projecting a lot of political weight on a simple statement that a kid wishes the president wouldn't make fun of other people. 

1. Knowing the current POTUS is an absolute minimum as soon as you learn about Washington and Jefferson. 

2. We teach kids not to be mean and not to make fun of other kids in class and on playgrounds as soon as kids interact with other kids. This applies to toddlers, too. 

Now, put the two together. It is normal for a kid to be taught to be nice then to see our POTUS literally making fun of his opponents and think hmm, something doesn't add up. And clips of POTUS can be found anywhere. YouTube, evening news, radio ads. So it isn't unimaginable that the kid was exposed to it somehow. 

There is no political commentary on Trump's ability to govern in that wish at all. It is a very simple behavioral observation."
pics,fel2fu6,t1_fel0taf,1579212604.0,"""For fuck sake most American Adults can't determine that.""

Sounds to me like an argument that civics should have been taught earlier.  

Knowing who is the current POTUS is like the most basic thing about civics there is. The ""I'm just a Bill"" song from school house rock that came out in the 90s was obviously written for elementary school kids. 

I don't understand your push back.  Naming the current POTUS takes all of 10 seconds when the kids learn about our founding fathers and who were some of our greatest presidents."
pics,fekzj0g,t1_fekww29,1579210856.0,"Civics are part of things that should be taught to kids at an young age.  Just because the kids in elementary know who the president is doesn't preclude them from learning other subjects. This isn't an either or proposition. 

Also, this is the only kid in the class with this dream, so we can preclude the idea that ""school is brainwashing the kids."". 

Now, let's discuss the parents. Of course kids would see the world through the eyes of their parents.  It is only natural when parents spent time with their kids. This is actually a neutral take as far as takes go. I can see Trump supporters voicing this explicit concern about Trump. 

Lastly, do you have kids?  If so, are you able to completely isolate your kids from how you felt about our government officials and political figures?"
