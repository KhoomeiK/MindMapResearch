That is what the GSC are, the Government made an amount of these being, then they broke out and killed all life in their universe, but they were in a parallel universe.

When they broke out the universe split into two, one where they never broke out and were instead eliminated by being placed into a Magma Chamber where they would just prepetually be cells trying to regenerate into their bodies, but  in the other one they killed all life and then decided to just sit there, among the blood of infinite lives taken, eternally bickering about how to recreate the universe, but they weren’t made to create, they were made to destroy"

They should be able to stand for their mistakes, take the blame for the murders they comit, get profit from the terrorists they stop.

That resulted in the largest masacre in history, killing over a billion people, all of them turned into piles of toothpicks, incinerated, shrunk to the size of ants or turned denser than the core of the sun, just for being afraid of, you know, the brothers of Satan himself, one of them only slightly different from Satan because they’re twins.
