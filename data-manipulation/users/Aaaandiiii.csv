I hate pizzas where the pepperoni are so big and tough that when you bite into one, the whole pepperoni in all the cheese comes along with it and of it's too hot, you get the chin burn. And the.

I can write with a more natural, smaller size and it's so so so beautiful when I scan stuff.

I've come to the point that I can be completely non-plussed to people treating me like crap in order to get something out of me (but I have like a 45 min limit before I start begging people to let me do whatever they want me to do).

I shot my shot with him so hard over and over (I didn't realize the rejection and he blurred the lines real bad) but he had zero interest in me. He really had me totally hooked that I quit my games cold turkey and abandoned Vent and that other Vent-like thing so that I wouldn't hear him and be drawn to him.

Thankfully after about half a year, his voice was gone from my head and I could text him and not be swooning. I look back on a lot of our conversations and realized that he was seriously toxic and had a lot of bad habits and lived in a fantasy bubble. So yeah, thank you hot voice guy.

My first trip usually is to restock staples exhausted over the weekend, and then I go on Wednesday for the new sales.

But then I look around and see that the 25%ers still get a check, they're not punished, and they're happier while I'm doing what I'm asked to keep the wheels turning and I'm miserable because that means I'm also picking up their slack.
