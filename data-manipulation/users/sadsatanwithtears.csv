SuicideWatch,fe4vx7s,t1_fe104fc,1578863289.0,My mother has always gone in there with me the only time I've ever been alone was getting my blood drawn and I was screaming the whole time. And then my aunt had took me to get tests done at a new place cause I was forced to get checked. She tried comforting me and she didn't wanna take me cause she knew how bad it hurt me to be cussed out and forced to go but all I could do was cry and tell her I was going to kill myself one day cause  everything I've been through and is going through. But I don't think I'm allowed to say what's going on with me cause I cant speak of the causes
