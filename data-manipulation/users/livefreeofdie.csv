joker,fftau24,t1_ffs8n2e,1580214785.0,"Bro, I agree with him. This is a movie appreciation sub. Do discuss joker. If you have no idea about the joker or didn't understand the movie go to different sub.

OP clearly said they don't know anything about Joker or superheroes. Then this sub isn't for them.

This is not Joker movie sub. This is Joker sub where we are discussing recent Joker movie."

joker,ffta52u,t1_ffsocgp,1580214062.0,"terrible reply

I just came to know about this.

All of internet is filled with his praise. I thought he was some legend. 

I noticed one anomaly a few days ago when r/unpopularopinion 's asshole mod(now I know that mod is asshole) posted about ""stop posting about Kobe or you will be banned"".

I wondered why would someone post about banning kobe posts?

Now I think those posts were about his sins and now everyone in world thinks he was God.

Does OP also think we should praise if some Current tyrant at the top of some country dies? Even though he is racist, homophobic and islamophobic and has ruined the economy of country?

Will you say there is a Time for that?

Even terrorist tyrants were praised in their country when they were killed by other countries. Do you think that's ok?"
