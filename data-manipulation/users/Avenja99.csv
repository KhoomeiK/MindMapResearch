I didn’t really ask permission. I ask if we had the money. Which is nice. I use her income as well when I buy something. Just as she does if she wants something. Guess I’m lucky. Idk.

HorriblyDepressing,fdm1ys3,t1_fdlqwtx,1578537888.0,Sounds like the parenting had a failure at some point. Or the son could have some sort of disability. If he wants to fuck animals that sounds a bit mental to me. Probably needs help.
