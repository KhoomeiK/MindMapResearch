I grew up in the NY, right outside of NYC, in the 60 and 70s.  The only thing Trump has ever cared about is self aggrandizement.  This is a man who tried to rip off his own father because a few hundred million he gave to him wasn't enough.  This is the guy who ripped off thousands,deliberately targeting the desperate, at the fake Trump ""University"".  He was always an asshole. Always a con artist.  Always a sociopath.  Always a racist and a bigot.  And perhaps the biggest liar that ever lived.  He's right out in the open about it but his supporters don't care because they're some variant of fucktard (big assholes and/or big idiots, e.g. you).

There was a lot of shit about Trump in the papers before he even ran....which apparently didn't concern his fuckface supporters.

We actually have to deal with Nazis now.  WTF!  The guy added 1.5T to the debt.  Climate change is now out of control.  We've lost our reputation around the world as Trump makes enemies of allies and coddles the worst dictators and that includes Putin who attacked the US.  That's the definition of Treason.

Most of the people that voted for him wanted to ""burn it all down"" because the party that he now heads have fucked them over gutting the middle class for the sake of the rich and so it continues.  Of course, then there are the Evangelicals for whom there are no words to accurately describe their hypocritical evil.  On the bright side, he's taught Americans that religiosity isn't just not the same thing as morality but often in opposition to it which has caused the young to abandon religion so at least something good has come of it.
