politics,fgj6pio,t1_fgik66g,1580838018.0,"Wealth doesn't guarantee progressivism, it only makes it possible. When assholes like the Saudis are supported by other regressive assholes like the Americans, it's easy for them to repress whoever they want. On the other hand, we can see trends toward progressivism in countries with relatively little wealth overall but a huge shift in wealth distribution, like Pakistan and Nigeria. They may not look progressive by our standards, but look at how far they've come since their relatively recent liberation from colonialism.

There are lots of factors at play that determine what happens once countries achieve the wealth necessary for women to be financially independent, but one thing is clear: until that happens, progress is impossible. As long as women don't have the means to make their own reproductive and social decisions via financial independence, nothing else can move forward."
politics,fgj5o29,t1_fgie48l,1580837450.0,"The problem here is that your scope is too narrow.

It's like all the Democrats who sit around chanting ""orange man bad!"" but don't want to tackle the real issues involving corruption within the DNC. It's easy to fixate, but it's masturbatory.

If you're under the impression that poor non-Muslim/non-Christian countries are somehow better for marginalized communities, you are mistaken. It's about economics. When countries get wealthy enough for women to be financially independent, they have a chance to become progressive. Until then, they're fucked regardless of what they believe in.

But every time I manually count the gap, the car is right. Three seconds exactly. It is just better at those calculations than we are.


You are mistaken about the car being unable to account for deer. People are taught to account for the possibility of pedestrians stepping out from between parked cars. From a coding perspective, all you're doing is applying the following distance formula to a different axis, perpendicular rather than parallel to your vector. What this means is that the cars can adjust their speed, or even route preferences, based on their perpendicular line of sight. In areas with heavy growth nearer the road, they'd prioritize driving closer to the center and adjust their speed to account for the speed of a deer divided by the line of sight distance, checked against their own stopping distance at any given speed."

If you've got X feet of clearing from your lane to the tree line, and you know deer can move Y feet per second, you can figure out exactly how fast you can go to accommodate a deer jumping out at you.

The biggest issue here is still line of sight. West Texas has the highest speed limits in the US, with 85 mph tollways. In reality, people routinely cruise at over 100, with virtually no crashes or fatalities. The roads are so straight and the land is so flat that you can see the curve of the horizon. You can even see armadillos more than 10 seconds out, and that's at 100 mph.

As for religion, I think that's what their interactions with humans are. A set of strange rituals with no natural meaning that seem to yield amazing, magical results.

A true autopilot works very differently and will simply avoid putting itself in those situations by thinking many steps ahead.

Don't get me wrong, I'd love for it to be as accessible, affordable, balanced, and delicious as other diets, but at least a couple of those are missing here. I hope we can get there soon."

As long as we're going with anecdotes, though: vegan foods generally taste like shit, especially if you come from a culture that doesn't subsist on corned beef and potatoes."

There is a huge variety of vegetarian food available from all different cultures, and most of it is minimally processed and can be made from scratch. Turns out, butter, milk, eggs, and honey are amazing and do wonders for basically everything. Take those away and your options narrow down exponentially."

Cows are used in very sustainable ways in many parts of India without killing them. They provide milk, they perform labor, and their feces are burned as fuel. Why? Because the demand for beef in those parts of India is very low. As a result, the cows live the same kind of life as a work dog in the West: not easy, but not awful by any means. That is definitely feasible on a larger scale."

Again, keep in mind that this data set is part of a larger whole, and all of it ultimately feeds into the program I'm writing to adjust respawn time based on blaster performance. Some of the advantages you're talking about aren't necessarily going to be seen in the numbers, but rather in the game rules. For example, the importance of shields in my games makes the Hammershot extremely valuable, since it is one of only manually-primed one-handed blasters. This helps to keep your respawn time low while also using a shield, making you a very tough opponent. You're hard to take down and will respawn quickly anyway.

As for the numbers implying that high cap is better, that is objectively true but not necessarily essential. High velocity and RoF are also better, but their impact on staying power is less significant. If you've got 5 rounds and your opponent is using a Magnum with 40, that's a HUGE difference. He can keep the pressure on you at a steady rate and suppress for his teammates. It really does matter in that role.

My point is that there is always some conditional scenario in which certain stats matter way more than others. I'm just collecting stats here. As a gamemaker, it is then my job to build scenarios that reward various stats in a balanced way."

AskAnthropology,feki1ko,t1_fekccd0,1579200474.0,"I apologize for being vague, initially. Let's get a timeline down so we are sure we're on the same page.

The ice ages had been going on for at least 2 million years intermittently, about the same time as human ancestors began emerging.

Homo Sapiens emerged about 200,000 years ago, exhibiting traits optimized for endurance running in hot environments.

Humans began leaving Subsaharan Africa around 50,000 years ago and expanding across Eurasia (though some groups probably left earlier).

With that established, I'm not saying that humans didn't experience cold climates, just that they hunted while it was hot. The desert might get very cold at night, but they hunted (and still do) from late morning through the afternoon, at which time the human body's heat management systems have an overwhelming advantage over animals that pant.

So yes, while the world in general, and parts of Africa, were cold during the time humans emerged, it is unlikely that we lived in places that weren't hot for at least some part of the day until after we evolved into anatomically modern humans.

This is further supported by how different out physiology is than most mammals who live in the desert. We don't even attempt to retain water, we don't enter dormant states in the cold, and we're not nocturnal. Everything points toward evolution in a hot environment with an abundance of water and less temperature fluctuation throughout the day."
AskAnthropology,fekg7p4,t1_fekdrbb,1579199382.0,"It wasn't so much the heat as the dryness. The ice ages made Subsaharan Africa generally much drier than before, which is also when we lost a lot of mammalian megafauna that relied on heavily forested areas that were giving way to grasslands and other relatively arid environments. Humans could still survive there, but could not sustain the same population density, hence the migration."
