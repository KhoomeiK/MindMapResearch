AskReddit,ff2z0mz,t1_ff2ygnc,1579529129.0,"People always say this like it's a magic cure all, but you have no idea what his job is. Having a stressful job is not the same thing as hating your job. As an introvert whose job is to negotiate all day, I need time to myself when I get off work to get back where I want my head to be for my family. That doesn't mean I have an awful job, nor would a new job cure the problem, as any job where I interact with people would still need that time. The commenter and her husband worked together to figure out what works for them, suggesting random life changes with no information is not putting them in a better spot than their own communication. Incidentally, if they also happen to need that particular job for whatever reason, it's basically saying, ""Well it's your own fault for having a job!"" which is also not helpful."

He's trained many a foster, and he's crate trained this puppy along with teaching him it's okay to be outside without a person right next to you.

If and when she asks you for something, ""That doesn't work for us."" You don't need a reason. Ignore, don't repeat yourself (""asked and answered"" is always a fun phrase), don't argue, just ""no thank you"", ""have a nice day"" *click*, or the classic subject change. You got this."

>The base fine will go up by $50, meaning a first-time violator on freeways or in electronic toll lanes will be fined $186.

>Second-time violators within two years will receive a fine of $336.

>Those trying to trick troopers with a dummy or mannequin will have an extra $200 added to their tickets.

>The Washington State Patrol has said high-occupancy vehicle lane cheating is the top complaint by commuters in Seattle's King County.

AdviceAnimals,feid7xh,t1_fegw5g4,1579135776.0,"I wondered something similar when halfway through the second to last episode my husband said, ""I think they might be jumping between timelines."" I thought he was joking but he wasn't, he genuinely didn't notice the details despite sitting and watching without distraction. I noticed the first episode from Renfri as well. I have no idea what that viewing experience is like and I wonder. I don't think it has anything at all to do with ""smarts"", but maybe just having done the mental training to notice details? I'm not sure. Are you a detail-oriented sort of person? Perhaps that's the driving factor."

The first year is really hard, and if you're keeping it together then you're doing great!). So something like, ""The doctor said there has been SO MUCH research in the last twenty years, and it's AMAZING how much they know now! Did you know [insert subject you're trying to drill in]?

Cutting the middle out is the same difference on work for both, but with square you don't lose out on the bits between like you would with the circles.

I think you may be right about the structural soundness, though, because you would lose out on the uniformity that the circle provides and end up with dense corners on the square donut. Plus, the round donut is ~27% fewer calories, so there's that, haha."

Installed 3 outlets in the built-in dry bar but no outlets in the bathrooms.

Built a 6' privacy fence around half the back patio... But it's not the half that would give privacy to the back door, and it's the north half, so it's not for the sun, there's old growth completely blocking the sight line of the neighbor to the north, and the rest of the fence is 4' chain link. I have no idea what that fence is possibly for or why someone would go to that much trouble for 3 sections of fence.

Built a living room add on that spans the whole width of the house (almost 50'), but didn't bother putting in a load bearing wall. It's begun to slouch slightly though I'm told by a few different folks in the business that it's not an imminent danger, but it does need to be addressed.

And my favorite: built a roof over the existing roof when they added the living room, didn't even bother to take the shingles or anything off the original roof. I don't know that it actually matters, I just find it amusing."

trippinthroughtime,fdfcamg,t1_fde61hv,1578358315.0,"So funnily enough I used to work at an incredibly expensive decorating store and I got a screaming good deal on an ""everyday suede"" sofa over a decade ago. Still have it. Cleans like a dream! We had a leather sofa but the dogs killed it. In general everything we have is pretty much dog/child resistant at least. We have commercial grade, wood-look vinyl (the kind that's as thick as tile and snaps together tongue and groove) that came with a lifetime warranty (3 years and it still looks great!). Most of the furniture is wood for easy repairs. 

For immediate solutions to the couch issue: if it's hopelessly stained, there are plenty of covers available that are universal fit, and I highly recommend microfiber/micro""suede""/""everyday suede"" materials. Synthetic fibers are your friend for clean up. Alternately, a queen-size quilt is about the right size to fully cover the seating areas of most couches. If she wants to try to clean the couches, Nature's Miracle is great as are baby wipes and elbow grease.

I tend to keep a fleece blanket over the couches because it's a dog hair magnet and then I can just toss them in the wash, which is nice. They also have the benefit of taking a second before they soak in liquid, so if someone has a spill you can whip it off real quick before it gets to the cushion."
