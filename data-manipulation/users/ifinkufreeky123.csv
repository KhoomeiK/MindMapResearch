dogs,fdk1vrb,t3_elrhj8,1578494000.0,"Yes you could, everyone can have a dog if you put effort into it. I worked fulltime always so to make up the time my dog lost with me he could sleep with me. If you get a little dog (female) you can train them to do it on the cat toilet for in case you get so depressed like in i cannot walk the dog now.. give it a bath sometimes, brush it and clip its nails. Dont forget vaccinations are very important if you get a pup make sure its got all vaccinations to be aloud outside ask your vet. 

And if i can advise you something else, ever looked into cats? Theyre wonderfull!!! Mine huggles with me every night and morning. And they need less taking care off. I always make sure her food bowl is full (dry food) clean cat toilet every night and give her some wet food now and then and obviously play time! Mine is an indoor cat :) get a nice scratchpole and some toys and prepare to get alot of love back. Plus they can be alone!"

Its brilliant!!! Vet recommended first heavy tablets which could damage his insides and some dogs died of em. Since he has the tablets he is not screaming for pain anymore and so quickly it worked. 

I also bought tramadol liquid for in case he does have pain but has not been necessary yet!!"

dogs,fd29nkd,t3_ejw8rb,1578143861.0,He needs to be constantly dehydrated keep also in mind once you have a dog with parvo the virus can live in the house for a year or so.. so any new unvaccinated pup can catch it again in future (always make sure before your pup comes outside that its had all 3 puppy injections) they get parvo from not being fully vaccinated and smelling other dogs poo.
dogs,fd27yku,t3_ejw8rb,1578143116.0,"Almost sure its parvo, please let them test for it... survival chance is low... he needs a vet now!"
dogs,fczdmlv,t3_ejggtk,1578098835.0,"I read your message now, sorry for your loss... youve done good. Alot of strengt for you the coming time... ❤ hope he had lovely weeks with u 

Pleas keep in mind that if you had a dog with parvo in home it stays in there for a year just to warn you a new pup could get is aswell if you were thinking of that in the future. You can google this.

Pups get 3 injections, 1 with 8 weeks, second at 12 weeks and third at 16 weeks something like that after that yearly. Before they have those injections they cannot be outside (even not after the third, you have to wait a week or something for it to kick in) not saying you dont know these things, i hope u do. Just for in case u dont. Parvo they get from smelling other dogs poo or you could even carry it inside under your shoe, or they can get it from the vet table."
dogs,fczclnn,t3_ejggtk,1578098221.0,We lost our pup a few weeks ago because of parvo... she showed signs and we took her at night to a emergency vet. First 2 days were ok.. after that she got blood in her stool and lost alot. They gave her a blood transfusion and she had been constantly on water fluids (thing in her leg that provided her with water and meds alot of em) she got weaker and weaker... sunday night we took her. Saturday morning she gave up... shes been there all the time and i visited her as much as i could. Worst thing ever happened to me... pleas take her to a vet she needs medicine and she will dry out soon!!! Wish you alot of strength the coming days and hope your pup survives. Treatment is very expensive... if you dont have money look on google you have to give her every hr water in her mouth and medicine and try make her eat.
dogs,fczbjgw,t3_ejkped,1578097599.0,"Please check for parvo, from when the signs start showing diarrea, vomits it wont be long before its over... lost our pup to it, took her on the day of the symptoms to the emergency vet. Has been there for 5 full days, day 6 in the morning she died... hopefully its not parvo. 

Puppys get 3 puppy shots which should prevent this from happening, thats why its best not to let them go outside the house untill they had all shots."

I would never get 2 males for that reason. I heard about someone i know with 2 doberman brothers been friends for 5 years and eventually this happened and a lot of bite wounds.. they have to be separated now.  

Im not sure what about it they are castrated but i would never risk it myself, even tho i prefer males"

Sleeps in our bed and has acces to the whole house all the time. We work both fulltime. If we go away for vacation my parents look after him and when i come back even when we were away for a weekend he does a pipi all over me from excitement haha when i pick him up. I can walk him off leash (started from day one as pup) and have a leather bag(pack) kind of thing for him *yes i know sounds ridiculous but super handy and he is aloud in a bar or shopping centres in shops that way!!* always happy whenever i come home and from day one always has food down so just refill when empty. He is my first ever dog nut but i love him to death, i have no idea what i would do without him. My favourite dog is a doberman but they require lots of exercise!!"

But there must be some renting possibility right? (Or rent particular and dont tell)* we had our chihuahua when we rented and soon got a husky, never told the owner. Unfortunately we rehomed her because we couldnt give her all the exercise she needed and she would be better of with ppl with a yard we thought. Now we bought our own apartment and will never have a problem of not being able to live somewhere with pets. We added a lovely black cat to the family :)"

dogs,fclowi9,t1_fckx4j6,1577752906.0,Is your chihuahua a girl? U could teach her to do her business on the cat toilet aswell. Ive got a chihuahua too (male) he goes out 3 a 4 times a day. + take him as much as i can. And weve got since may a super cute black cat. She cuddles me alot especially in bed morning and night. And both follow me around the house.
dogs,fclnuyu,t1_fclmqup,1577752196.0,"I have a chihuahua and he is my best friend, i do miss aswell sometimes having a big dog but i got him as a gift when i started living on my own and he is the best dog ever. Plus i can take him everywhere... he does not need long walks (which would be cool in owning a big dog) but i have to say im not depressed and i think alot of dog owners hate getting out to walk the dog especially in cold weather. Mine gets 4 walks a day min 10 min and he goes almost everywhere with me. With a big dog youll have to walk it at least 1.5 hr a day in total.. think of that else they can become destructive or agressive. My chi got reuma arthritis so i dont take him for long walks or carry him. (Never gave him too long walks) but he loves more going everywhere with me even to a bar haha"
