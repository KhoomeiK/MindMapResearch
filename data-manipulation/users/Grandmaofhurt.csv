It's not mysterious. That's a terrible, awful, unloving plan. Then why did he give us free will? What was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil? And of course this is skipping over the whole illogical aspect that there was no knowledge of what was good or evil so of course they'd eat from the tree. They were told not to, so they didn't, but then they were told to do so by the devil snake. There was no knowledge of what was good and what was bad so of course they'd go and eat it. They didn't know that it was good not to and bad to do so, which of course means they didn't really have free will, they were suggestible husks essentially. All god had to do was tell them not to eat it right after the snake did and they'd follow that. Sorry, just going on a tangent here."

America warned the Japanese that we had a weapon of unparalleled power and the likes of which had never been seen before and to surrender before it was used. Also the Japanese were not willing to surrender, they were readying their general population to conduct a guerrilla style defense of the island. The Allies saw how the Germans defended their homeland up until the absolute last second and they knew that Japan would be even more difficult because it would be an amphibious invasion. The US predicted the loss of over one million American soldiers and a possible 10 million plus Japanese deaths, military and civilian so the cost-benefit favored dropping the atomic bombs significantly and in the end it saved many lives that would've certainly been lost."

MMA,fewvyg2,t3_eqsdq4,1579420338.0,"I was at a party for this fight. I got invited by a girl I had never met until tonight, just been talking the past few days on Hinge. She didn't seem uber SJW in the slightest but at the party, like 80+% were very ""woke"" and someone asked who we should be cheering for because this is not their thing, I said McGregor is who I'm for and this other girl pipes in saying well I'm going off morals and I'm not going to cheer for the sex assaulting fighter. So without a follow up, a question about the circumstances or any inquiry whatsoever into this girls statement, most of the people in the group basically just took these opinions on with apparent conviction. They went from utter apathy to despising him and acting like they had cared all along. Then the passive aggressive comments came. They were obviously referring to me when talking to someone else about 'McGregor fans' and that sort of thing because they didn't have the fortitude to say anything directly to me. It was kinda hilarious because none of them knew anything at all about him other than that singular sentence that one girl said about him committing sexual assault so they would dug into and mined that one vein hard. 

Anyways fast forward, McGregor is elbowing, shouldering, kicking and punching Cerrone in mostly the face until he KO's dozens of seconds into the first round and I'm happy and cheering, not crazy, not loud but I'm celebrating! The look on the faces of these lackluster, only have opinions that make me look like I have the moral high ground, thought husks was priceless and I knew they couldn't say a damn thing. Not only did he lose in a spectacular fashion, they didn't know anything about the sport, mixed martial arts, wrestling, boxing, etc to be able to try and mitigate my gloating. So for the rest of the 45 mins I was there I was much happier than I had been prior to the end of that fight. And btw this was in the San Francisco Bay area so there are people like this who hold opinions for what appears to be just the sole purpose of the satisfaction the get from others around them knowing they believe that way and they believe they are morally superior. I just basically described virtue signalling in a long winded way.

So 9/10 night. Would do again."

apple,fepxnvo,t1_fepsbun,1579334218.0,"Well not necessarily, the transmitting pod can determine the additional time it takes for the signal to be transmitted and then played through the receivers speaker, the transmission time will not be accounted for really as this will practically be instantaneous travelling at the speed of light, but as it goes through the equalizing, decoding, ADC and what not, the transmitting airpod can delay until the other is playing if necessary at all as the whole process is happening at imperceptible to human ear speeds. 

And what you described is assuming the transmitting airpod is the cause of the noise. It could be in the receiving pod and there is a fault somewhere in its circuitry introducing interference or higher than normal bit errors in it's digital signal processing, both of which could cause a fuzzier sound. 

Have you tried using the airpods one at a time? Try using just the left, just the right, and then also try using one for a bit and then pop the other in so it has to set up the relaying situation, but I'm sure the airpods will switch on the fly to the airpod with the best signal as the transmitting airpod, but don't hold me to that, I'm not sure if that is the actual functionality. Both airpods contain the W1 or H1 (depending on the generation) and so they both can act as the receiver or transmitter though. This may help narrow down if it's independent of relaying or happens only during such cases. If the noise is there no matter what I'd say that it is most likely a fault at the 'front end', so to speak, of the audio process and something may be introducing higher than normal bit errors or there is some interference occurring and with you saying it happens when you get louder, it could be the microphone processing somehow is causing an interference in the speaker circuitry, maybe some cross talk, I'm just guessing at this point. I am an EE so it's not unfounded guessing at least. I'd take them to Apple and see if they'll replace the pod deeming it a defective product."
apple,feps0fl,t1_fenogip,1579329297.0,"For anyone unaware of how the Airpods work and what causes issues in one and not the other or battery drain higher in one than the other is because the Bluetooth signal is streamed to one of the pods and then that pod uses it's H1 or W1 processor to stream that signal to the other pod. The Bluetooth signal from the phone doesn't go to both, it's essentially relayed."

HaloStory,feonbhp,t1_fel06nd,1579302555.0,"Ehhh, a little. There devotion to honor above all else can affect their ability to make a strategically sound decision, but the Elites were strategically minded and probably the most of all the races of the Covenant and one of the reasons they were pretty much the exclusive race who was allowed to become a Shipmaster. Overall though, the other races bring down the strategic capabilities of the Covenant on the ground.

Human also have much more ingenuity than them. The Covenant was imitative, rather than innovative and so while Humanity has had to develop everything from their minds, the ability, necessity and generations of doing so made humans better at critical thinking combined with the recognition that their is no off-limits tactic if it means winning now or later."

HaloStory,fek5gca,t1_fejhsqo,1579193005.0,"In computational abilities and specifically AI, humanity is more advanced than the Covenant. Also in military tactics and strategy, humanity has the upper hand. Humans just have better tactical minds and strategic planning abilities, plus Humans overall are more disciplined and tenacious than the average Covenant soldier so they will follow their chain of command and they will keep fighting in the face of death, whether that be to hold off the enemy from a larger more valuable target or to simply go on the offensive and create a distraction. Humans will do these things readily and it much us better overall soldiers and why the Covenant didn't completely and utterly steamroll us, just moderately so. It's one of the main factors why the humans can go toe-to-toe with the Covies in ground engagements and many times come out on top despite them having superior weaponry. But the war in space and in orbit is another story and once the planetary defenses fall and the Covenant begin glassing, it doesn't matter how many ground engagements you won."
videos,feiawwv,t3_ep4mpa,1579134233.0,"So anyone curious on the magnets and heat physics, basically magnets are the result of atoms of a material mostly all aligned a certain way (it's very dependent on the electrons configuration) and they are mostly oriented such that the millions and billions of tiny aligned, more positive than negative on one side atoms all point in the same direction. So one side has a sum of net positive and net negative on the other. But heat is just simply the kinetic energy of the atoms of a material, so as they heat up they are experiencing random thermal motion and the alignments are now much less oriented in similar directions causing the net positive and net negative to be reduced."
