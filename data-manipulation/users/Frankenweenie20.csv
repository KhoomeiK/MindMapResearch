Democrats are pushing swing votes and traditional Democrats to Trump by pushing this impeachment forward when not as many of them want it as people believe.

Yes yes I know the Polls. The only problem with the polls is you need to dig deeper. There are public galleries to watch the impeachment hearings. They are half empty.

TV channels are getting lower numbers for the impeachment hearings than for soap operas.

People are not interested. They are bored. They do not care."

Maybe try watching Trumps lawyer make his case

politics,ffljyla,t1_ffk26fg,1580040522.0,"Actually I am correct about Ukraine not knowing about the aid.

How do we know?

Because the Ukraine only raised the issue with Washington and US diplomats when the Politico article came out at the end of August (text messages and witness statements show that to be the case).

Numerous Whitehouse officials have testified their counterparts in Ukraine never mentioned the aid in all the face to face meetings and phone calls emails etc they had between the phone call and the politico article.

The Ukranian President and all Ukranian staff involved have said they were unaware the aid was withheld until the politico article was published.

So either all the ambassadors and staff who have testified under oath and the Ukranian President and staff are lying about when the Ukrainians found out and they have faked text message exchanges or.... The FORMER Ukranian ""official"" is lying.

I know who I believe and it's not someone who's story does not have anything to back it up.
The FORMER Ukranian official is lying which given the corruption in Ukraine would not surprise me."
politics,fflhjpi,t1_ffjwqqi,1580039741.0,"OK. In VERY simple terms.
Trump spoke to the Ukrainian president in early July and asked him to investigate corruption.

The Ukranians DID NOT become aware the aid had been withheld until the end of August (over a month later) and they only found out because Politico ran a story on it.

Over a Month between Trump asking Ukraine to investigate corruption and Ukraine finding out the aid had been withheld.

This is not a disputable fact as everyone directly involved and all evidence shows that time line (text messages, witness statements etc).

So how could the aid be tied to Trump asking Zelinsky for corruption to be investigated when Trump and the WH didn't even make Ukraine aware the aid was withheld?

The White House and Trump never told Ukraine the aid was withheld. Fact. Ukraine found out from an article in politico 4+ weeks later. Fact.

The aid being released when it became known by Ukraine is perfectly understandable in that continuing to withhold it could be seen badly by the Ukrainians and damage relations."
politics,ffjtiwy,t1_ffjmd1m,1580006534.0,"Without witnesses? Fucking seriously?
The Democrats spent months investigating and interrogating witnesses of their choice and requesting and going through mountains of documents to build their case for impeachment.

Now apparently they should be allowed to continue their investigation with new witnesses (only the ones they want) and new documents and records in the Senate to try find something to impeach Trump for when they are meant to present the evidence they believe they found that makes Trump guilty and worthy of impeachment.

If they didn't have evidence showing Trump is guilty they shouldn't have impeached him but this is not about Trumps got our innocence. 

Pelosi made that clear when she said he should be impeached before the record of the call was even released. Most Democrats made that clear when they called for the ""Motherfucker"" to be impeached from the day he was inaugurated.

Democrats were going to impeach him guilty or not. 
He could be the reincarnation of Christ they would still impeach him,

They have openly stated it's the only way to stop him winning in 2020 is to impeach and remove him from office.

The Democrats have a right to be running the US. It is their entitlement."
politics,ffjrxzl,t1_ffjpmhu,1580005315.0,"No. He sees Ukraine as being historically corrupt and it now has a new leadership who campaigned to get into office based on being anti corruption.

Trump asked Ukraine as he is well within his rights and obligated to do, to investigate allegations of Ukranian election interference in the 2016 election as well as Crowdstrike  and burisma (not a US company) and Hunter and Joe Biden.

He did not ask Ukraine to investigate the Democratic party specifically although there is a belief they were involved with Steele dossier etc.

As has been shown since he became POTUS. Nevertrumpers within government will do anything they can to undermine, oppose and if possible remove him. Leaking information. Refusing to carry out his policies. Ambassadors like Yavanovitch badmouthing him to foreign governments etc.

Why would he trust the DID? A department who were OK with Biden's son working for a corrupt Ukrainian company while Biden was VP and in charge of rooting out corruption in Ukraine?"
politics,ffjqkq9,t1_ffjpjrs,1580004402.0,"It is also not an indictable ""offence"".

The Democrats are simply trying to use the ""conveniently timed released"" report to try bolster their lack of any kind of indictable offence by Trump.

Numerous other presidents have done exactly what Trump did over the years because this law was brought in to in effect try seize powers from the president and hand it to Senators instead. It's a law all presidents have opposed.

Standard muddy the waters and try confuse people to try make something out of nothing. 

It won't. There is literally no indictable offence which is why they moved from failed Russian collusion to failed abuse of office to failed obstruction.

They are just flinging shit and hoping no one will notice and something will stick."
