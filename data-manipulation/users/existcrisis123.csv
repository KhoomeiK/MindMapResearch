Maybe you better yourself by working out and writing a famous novel.

SeriousConversation,fcwsixs,t3_ej6k4c,1578035849.0,"I would suggest enrolling in a trade type thing that doesn't have a physical aspect. For instance, a 1-2 year course at a local college. Then you can get a job and work while you can take all the time in the world to figure out your true passion in life. Some people don't find it until their 30s, 50s, 80s, or they never do. So don't put that much pressure on yourself to choose a permanent life path in the next few days.

You can do courses on office administration, cooking, fashion, graphic design, lots of stuff. Just pick one and give it a go for now. Or just get a plain old fashioned job. Like working in a liquor store, they usually pay pretty darn decently for a job that requires no experience.

You can spend your days raking in some cash while daydreaming and experimenting with hobbies until you find what ignites the flame in you."
AskDocs,fcws5ko,t3_ejb9gp,1578035428.0,"I am not a doctor and don't know what's wrong with you but I have some friendly advice that might possibly be helpful in having a doctor take you more seriously.

You list a lot of complaints/symptoms, some serious-sounding and some not, and you list them in seemingly random order. If you approach a doctor with ALL of this, they may feel as if you are a hypochondriac and exasperating your own issues.

I understand you listed as much as possible so that the docs can have all the information (and in case one of these leads to an 'aha' moment). So I would suggest this:

Make a short list of your MOST serious/obvious/undeniable symptoms and write them down. You mentioned geographic tongue for instance, this is a nice obvious symptom that the doctor can clearly see for himself. Mouth sores and fever a doctor can also see for himself. And a bleeding throat is definitely serious-sounding.

Once you make the short list of about the top 5 symptoms, write your own backup list of all the smaller symptoms, in order of importance. If you feel you need to mention some of these smaller ones (like occasional slight nausea), you can do so, but preface it by letting the doctor know you were just trying to think of everything you possibly can that might help, and you are aware that they might be not serious and/or unrelated.

Hope that helps and good luck."

1) the man grabbing her hand after she said she does not want it, then
2) another man shushing her while physically wrapping her in an embrace (??) as the first man walks away.

I can think of almost nothing more patronizing than that entire scene."
