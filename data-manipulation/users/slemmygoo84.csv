SuicideWatch,ffitqd7,t3_etsvym,1579982490.0,"Kris... I know the lies depression is feeding you right now. My depression has sounded exactly like this before. I hope you can read this, believe me, and remember that these dark hopeless thoughts that slowly and insidiously infiltrate your consciousness are lies. 

I also urge you to seek help, and keep asking for it from people until you feel like you have found the help you need. That help looks different for each of us. Just like we each have different methods of wiping our asses...  we each have different ways of finding ways out of hopelessness. Hell, of finding a way to just feel okay enough to face a day. 

For me, that looks like going to a therapist on a consistent basis, a psychiatrist regularly (and taking a medication daily), being an active member of a 12 step program, practicing meditation working a low stress job that allows me to focus on finally getting well and pays just enough to cover living expenses. And more than anything... being just selfish enough to surround myself with people who can actually be supportive and understanding of what I'm doing in my life. 

My disease loves to keep me isolated, thinking that I'm alone and that nobody cares about me... but experience has shown me that there are people who understand and care. I'm so proud of you for posting here and being so honest about what you are going through. That is wonderful. And thank you for allowing us all the opportunity to be here for you in this moment. It's a gift for us all. 

Keep searching for the light and the truth. Don't give up."

SuicideWatch,fe8mkmf,t3_eo0v3v,1578927970.0,"I think most adults feel like this at some point, honestly. Just not all of us consider suicide as serious option. Like, for me sometimes that feeling that I want to escape comes off as ""I want to run away"", or ""I want to go home"", and then I quickly realize that I have no place to ""run"" to and no childhood home that I'd ever actually want to be in. In the past, those realizations only compounded that stuck, frustrated, hopelessness. Shit got REAL dark... REAL fast. 
To make things worse, the nature of depression wants us alone. It wants us to isolate and not talk about what's happening inside us. So the darkness consumes us as easy prey. We become loops of amplified negative thoughts and that cycle is incredibly difficult to stop once I'm in it.
I'm so grateful that I kept saying shit to people in spite of my own head telling me not to. So when my suicide attempt failed... everyone (including me) knew how important it was that I focus a huge amount of time and energy on getting well. I found the people (doctor, therapist, friends and 12 step support groups) I need to stand a fighting chance. The fight is still very real for me, it always will be but it has gotten easier. 
Please don't give up now. There are people and places that can and want to help you. Just keep asking for help and take the help when its offered. You deserve it. We deserve it."
AskReddit,fdic1ol,t3_elbejj,1578439525.0,"As a child: ""I'll give you something to cry about!"" 

I remember thinking, ""I'm already crying, how is hitting me going to make me not cry?!""

As an adult addict in recovery: "" No news is good news!"" 

Obviously, these people have never known/loved a drug addict."
Sober,fcj5ebt,t1_fcj1dpn,1577677695.0,"Yes!! This. 
This is what came for me when I actually started -working- a 12 step program. I got a sponsor and got honest with myself, with the help of a power greater than myself. Life is not perfect today but I am reasonably happy and I have a way to live life on lifes terms. And, in no way do I want to drink or use. That obsession is gone.
For those alcoholics/addicts not willing to work a program, yea.. life stays pretty miserable. I'd have a shit time staying sober too. I'm so grateful that I dont have to live like that today."
