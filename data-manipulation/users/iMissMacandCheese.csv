Nigerian fufu is different than Ghanaian fufu, but that definitely sounds interesting, I’ll check her out, thanks!"
1200isplentyketo,ffapw5c,t3_esjkas,1579741709.0,"My husband is from a culture where meals are basically some giant starchy ball accompanied by fatty/proteiny soups. So we've been doing the soup part on a regular basis, but just leaving out the starchy ball part. 

Think Thai food. You can order a curry and just eat the bowl of curry with whatever protein is in there and skip having the rice. The other person can eat the curry + rice if they like. 

I guess it's different depending on how the carb is incorporated to meals and dishes, but that's what's worked for us."

WeightLossNews,fep7v1p,t1_fenqnik,1579314100.0,"Yup. Egg, some butter, some cheese, 2tbsp of heavy cream with my coffee, tons of spinach, chicken, some olive oil, greek yogurt, blueberries, strawberries, flax. Steak for special occasions. 

Occasionally variations from that list or minor additions, but that's the bulk of what I eat when doing keto."

limejuicer,fe0ada6,t3_eng6ep,1578807652.0,What does ZenDesk have to do with this? It’s just a communication platform. Your issue is with the agents. This would be like blaming Facebook Messenger that the person you’re messaging is stupid.
1200isplentyketo,fcwjt72,t1_fcp75b4,1578027560.0,"The reason I use keto for weight loss is because the hunger pangs and appetite are greatly reduced compared to when I eat the same number of calories non-keto. I try to avoid them as much as possible, but I build in little ""cheats"" to my daily budget, like 1/4 a serving of peanut butter (which is 8 grams of peanut butter, about a teaspoon, for 50 calories). I also eat a ton of spinach for bulk. It fibrous and nutrition dense. Usually my main meal is some kind of buttery cheesy eggy meaty concoction, eaten over a bed of spinach, sometimes with a dash of olive oil on the spinach to make it less dry. 

If you're feeling hunger pangs, maybe try different combos for your main meal? Sometimes I'll have fattier meat, and sometimes I'll have leaner meat, with fattier toppings, which lets me feel like I'm eating more. I try to make my meals feel as decadent as possible without going outside of my calorie range and macros."

If you think about what he does and what he’s selling he needs to be really vigilant about avoiding sounding creepy and harboring creeps."

I set up a Squarespace website for my husband (a musician) in 2016. Most of it was probably how I wanted in 2017, but I couldn't make decisions about some stupid little things. I finally made it public a few months ago. Completely ridiculous.

PS. I'm completely aware that's not real web-dev, which I'm starting to learn now. But procrastination can be a real killer no matter what language or platform you're working with."

In my local store there are ""30% off"" manager specials on meat that needs to be sold, but the tradeoff is you'll need to eat it that day or the next."
1200isplentyketo,fce6bo1,t1_fc27mda,1577617328.0,"Carbs are an upper limit, protein is a goal range, fat just fills in the calories to get you to your calorie goal. If you ate some chicken and are satiated on that you don't need to add fat just for fun. The point of using keto for weight loss is to get your body to use its own fat stores for the energy it needs."
