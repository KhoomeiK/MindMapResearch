I can tell you, what these people do shouldn't happen, but the instant negative portrayal just shows the world a single act, and not the brutal 20 year build-up.

You feel alone, rejected, hopeless, and all kinds of stuff. Where I turned to vices, in those places, I would likely have turned to darker practices."
