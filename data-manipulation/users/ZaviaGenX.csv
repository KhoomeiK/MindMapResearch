We brought it to single digits % with our hosp/hotel linen tracking solution. Interested?

Aliexpress,ffbrk88,t1_ffbj7n1,1579779965.0,The phone cases you buy retail for 10-30 bucks are the same as ali most of the time. Just buy on ali and pick the right model.
DotA2,ffb8ckb,t1_ff9zkor,1579754829.0,"Interesting.

As someone who took a few years off dota, my mechanical knowledge is at an all time low (havnt really figured/optimised talents yet, damm map feels different, etc). My internal clock doesn't account for outposts (still does for runes yay) and im relearning/hunting all the ward spots again.

But i Play decently. Probably at 49% win rate (playing new techies isnt helping my win rate lol). Dont have to think too much, same intuition, same juking skills, similar map awareness. 

But being aware of how much I don't know really does feel heavy."

ChoosingBeggars,ff906q4,t1_ff8x1xh,1579701474.0,"Having some experience ( in asia), this is true. I've seen cheap, moderate and expensive jobs. Material cost isn't as important as skill and experience. Consequently, the good ones have strong reputation n value their skills accordingly.

Posted who said they are making 10-20% profit is lying or unlicensed.


Example:
Last month, I changed 1x my tie rod end in my car. Was quoted usd50 for parts and usd20 for labour for both sides. 

I bought my own part, 555 made in japan, for usd25, passed 1 tierod to em, and their labor adjusted upwards to usd15 cos they don't earn on product (its how it is here).

There is at least 100% profit on the product not to mention the labor. And they are the cheaper option of the neighborhood. Licenced, with shop n full equipment, legit registered company.
