Set boundary 

Set boundary again and establish consequence

Enforce consequence and explain why. 

I did this with employees when I was a manager, and I did this with family, and I did this with a friend that was borderline verbally abusive.

Also feel free to skip step one or two if the behavior is egregious enough. Sexual harassment comment might get all three steps but a colleague grabbing my butt is straight to step 3.

Also, beware using couching terms and know your audience. In the terms of workplace harassment, ""I *feel* like those terms are wrong to use"", is not a boundery. ""Those terms are awful(no feelings mentioned) use these terms instead."" That is both a statement and a boundary. Theres a difference between I feel, I want and I need(and also these are all ""i"" statements) don't over explain, but add a reason if its necessary. Sometimes ""I feel"" is a reason.

Also helps to talk about the future. ""I noticed you did x(not a question, no room to deny behavior), (also beware asking why someone did a behavior, you're asking for an excuse) moving forward you need to do x(no reason to deny behavior now), you can also ask what behavior would be better. ""What would/could/should you do differently next time?"" (Know your audience)

I think the most important difference is the timeline. If someone does something you really don't like, there's no reason not to bring it up. And saying you dont like it now, once is better than 6 mos from now saying ""you did this AND this AND this, and now I'm so damn bothered"""

""Oh no, I'm stuck in a traffic jam of thought. I need to remember all these things because they are important.
WAIT. Only some of these things are important. Is this important no, close tab, is this important? Yes, can I take care of it now? If yes then let's, if not than let's plan a time to do it or deal with it. Go through all.thoughts.

Now, closing tabs is an ok example but thinking of them as popups is more accurate. But I just close them. The biggest thing for me, is really prioritizing what I WANT to be thinking about, or need to be thinking about. My brain will tell me it's a level 100000 priority to think about (a thing that matters or not just not right now). I also like to forget things (well, what did you forget? I DONT KNOW!) so I have become very laid back. Maybe it was important maybe it wasnt. In the beginning I forgot lots of important things, but I forgot them wether I was stressed or not, so letting it go became easier. And the more I did this the less I would forget important stuff.

Sometimes, I clear everything out at once and think ""what should I be thinking about now"" like a fresh start where I just swipe every paper off my desk and only deal with incoming thoughts one or 2 at a time.

Lastly, this is a process. Not a one time thing. When I started it fell like I was doing this CONSTANTLY and was almost as overwhelming as the thoughts before. But I promised myself it was ok to get stuck and it didnt matter how long I was stuck as long as I started now. Slowly, I was mindful faster, more often. I was less stuck before realizing I was stuck. 

So, even if I'm 20minutes into a convo, but NOW realized I was getting lost or being a shitty listener, I can listen now and still be better off than if I never noticed at all. Same for the log jam. It doesn't matter how far down you got, clean your slate and start from here.

Thanks for expressing this. I always thought the physical weight of all these thoughts was weird.

I try and do the same for activities. Any time spent doing thing is better than no time doing thing."

relationships,ff906lm,t3_es38m5,1579701471.0,"I think even if it is schizophrenia going ""behind her back"" to her parents will take away a lot of trust. Talking to her directly is always the best bet, and if that doesn't help at all, then and only then would I go tell everyone else. Also, phrasing is everything. 

""Hey friend, we miss you when we go out. Is there an activity that you would like to go on with us?"" ""Hey friend, I dont see bugs on you, I think we should let the RA know you've got a bug problem, and if it persists after they spray, we should talk about them again"" ""hey friend, I'm thinking of going to schools counseling services, have you been?""

Also... about that last one. If your school does offer free counseling you should check them out. Firstly, this thing is stressful for you  and secondly you can see if they really are bad at stuff and thirdly they may have further advice for you. 

At my university we had counselors not psychiatrists. And the way I think of it, counselors deal with feelings and actions while psychiatrists deal with brain chemistry. Even if your friend is schizophrenic she still can use help with her feelings and actions.

Also, if she is schizophrenic her life is FUCKED. So you should still go to counseling because whether you stay her friend or not you're about to have a fair amount if your own baggage."
