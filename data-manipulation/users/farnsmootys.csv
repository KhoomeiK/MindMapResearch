Agnes has a standard English pronunciation and people will understandably assume that that's how it's pronounced unless otherwise told.

I agree with other commenters that the more intuitive spellings like **Ahnyes** looks pretty weird.

Would she consider **Anya** instead? It's more common than Ahnyes, sounds similar and most people will be able to pronounce it."

petfree,fcuhoy2,t1_fctk6sc,1577981212.0,"Just because you can kill an animal doesn't mean the killing has to be inhumane.

Drowning the dog was inhumane. There are established ways of killing animals that don't cause as much distress or pain.

She should have gotten a vet to put it down if she wanted to kill it. Better yet, she should have given it to the pound so it actually has a chance of being rehoused with a different owner who **actually** wants it. If they can't rehouse it, then the pound can euthanize it properly.

**Killing the dog herself was not her only option and shouldn't have been her first choice.**

I am PetFree and don't want pets in my life but that does NOT mean I want to see them experience more pain than is necessary.

God put us on this earth to be the stewards of His creation and the animals and plants that inhabit it. We wield superiority over our domain and it's creatures but must do so with responsibility and respect for that creation. Killing an animal in a way that causes undue pain and suffering is not a way to show our respect for it."

The only things that stand out to me are:

* If Giselle gets bullied she might get mean nicknames at some point involving the word 'jizz'
* Darcy might hear a lot of references to Pride and Prejudice throughout his life
* Oskar and Maddalena might get their names misspelled all the time

Other than that, I can't imagine why your family is poo-pooing these names.

Also, I don't agree with the other folks saying Eloria and Florian are too similar. If it were Floria and Florian I'd agree but I don't forsee much confusion between Eloria and Florian.

Of your names I liked these the most:

Girl - Gisele, Felicity, Aurora

Boy - Roman, Florian, Oskar"

namenerds,fck0ftw,t3_ehid8a,1577712671.0,"If they are mispronouncing your name because of the spelling, then I think it would be helpful to spell your name **Jung** instead of Zheng.

Zheng is perfectly fine if you're using the pinyin system to write Chinese sounds but most Americans aren't going to have a working knowledge of it and will mispronounce it. They won't know that the ""Zh"" sounds is closer to ""J"" than it is to ""Z"" and that the ""E"" sound is closer to ""UH"" than it is to ""EH"".

If you spell it **Jung**, I think Americans will be more likely to pronounce it correctly.

---

If they are still having trouble with **Jung**, then choosing an anglicized name would be best. I think that **John** sounds similar and is a common enough name that it's impossible to mess up."
