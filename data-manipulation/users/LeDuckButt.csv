MINI,ffeuz44,t3_et2l47,1579866685.0,"I may be the exception to the rule here. I have an '07 R56 with a notoriously unreliable engine, but its currently a high mileage hero with 230,000 km  (143,000 mi)   
Its not been without its problems, but as with any engine its all about how well you take care of it.   


That being said even if its well maintained it can surprise you. If its for his job, it may not not suit as if and when a repair is needed, it can be costly. Mine had the temp spike all of a sudden when driving, turned out to be the engine thermometer and water pump had packed in. Cost me nearly €1200 ($1300 USD) in repairs, and you don't need that on a limited budget."

My fianceé and I had only just gotten engaged at this point (about a week) and we were driving through the Rocky Mountains from Calgary, AB to Invermere BC on a beautiful summers day. 
Both being from Ireland, we hadn't seen views quite like the ones we saw that day, and haven't again since. Long winding roads, clear blue skies reflecting off the gorgeous roadside lakes, and the windows down in the shitty '94 Ford Escort we picked up for $500. 

We had been to one of Ezra's Top Secret Tour gigs back in Ireland before, where we had heard the song before it's official release.
That day, we heard it on the radio for the first time and we sang along, feeling every word of it, and every time this song plays it brings me back, and reminds me just how much we loved that day, our time in Canada and how much I love her."

unpopularopinion,fcel8ys,t3_egz3vz,1577621513.0,"How do I begin on a post that's so absurdly obtuse?  
My parents didn't vaccinate me. This is something I'm trying to correct this coming year, but the fact that they didn't doesn't mean they don't love me.   


They worked their hands to the bone to afford and maintain a house and provide an education for me and my three siblings. They worked overtime and night shifts to put all four of us through college, even multiple times in some of our cases. And you think that they don't love us?  
They backed us up at every turn in life, fighting in our corner, even when we were in the wrong. They supported every major decision we made in our lives, from what colleges we applied for, what jobs we applied for, and always gave a shoulder to cry on when we felt we couldn't. They encouraged us to push ourselves and reach our goals, and you *dare*to say they don't love us.  


Whilst I don't agree with their choice regarding vaccines, I respect why they didn't. They didn't because they truly believed in the harmful side of it and didn't do it *because they loved us.* If you ever had a child, you would do what you hope is best for them to survive in the world as my parents did for me and my three siblings. I don't share their vaccination views, but I understand that they truly feared it would harm us at a young age, and I get that.   


They did what they did because they loved us, not because they didn't, and truly hope you can steer yourself from such a twisted viewpoint."
