SquaredCircle,ffbkt1q,t1_ffaugtu,1579770114.0,There was also the one where the NXT crowd sang Becky Lynch’s theme after her match against Sasha at Unstoppable (aka the moment that pushed her to becoming a superstar).
AskReddit,ffatcng,t3_esi1iu,1579744024.0,"I was an assistant manager at a Blockbuster in early 2008 or so. I knew we had been slowly declining for a while (an increasingly lower budget for ordering movies and inventory from our vendors was the big clue), but it was getting pretty bad.

The day that pretty much sealed the deal was a random Tuesday. We had ONE customer come in that day. We made $35 in revenue, and $30 of that was an automated Movie Pass renewal. I told my co-worker, ""Yeah, we're closing before the year ends."" We lasted another three months."

1) Someone who wants to troll everyone by saying, ""Since everyone else is going to vote for him, I won't, just to keep it from being unanimous"".

2) Dan Shaughnessy.

Could be both."

If he could've managed to stay healthy even through the late 70s, maybe the Bruins win another Cup, maybe he wins another Hart trophy or scoring title or two (and god knows how many more Norris trophies)."
todayilearned,ff4n526,t1_ff3ty5m,1579567654.0,"You didn't even include the craziness of their final NHL game!

So, as the above comment mentioned, Daniel was picked 2nd and Henrik 3rd in the 1999 Draft. Daniel ending up wearing #22 and Henrik wore #33 for this reason.

So midway through their final NHL game, Daniel ties it with his 22nd goal of the season at the 0:33 second mark of the 2nd period. Then it gets to overtime, where [Henrik sets up Daniel for the game winner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6acaWp91s3E) (his 2nd goal of the game) at 2:33 of the period. And it was the future captain Bo Horvat's 23rd birthday. Just a lot of weird coincidences."

todayilearned,ff4l12e,t1_ff4hhp0,1579566180.0,"Not to mention the fact that at the time of Lemieux's first retirement, his PPG average was higher. It's when he came back after purchasing the team (and playing a good portion of those seasons on some of the weakest teams imaginable -- a.k.a. The Rico Fata Era) that his production dipped below Gretzky's. The chronic injuries didn't help matters, either."

gaming,fd5jf4k,t1_fd3uv0z,1578178251.0,"This was one of the last open-world games where I actually was willing (and able) to explore every nook and cranny to find all the collectibles. It was just large enough to be extremely varied and make you feel like you were in a whole other section of the map, but still small enough where you didn't feel like you were never going to find everything (seriously, fuck the GTA IV pigeons)."

nextfuckinglevel,fcd44co,t3_egzxhv,1577606117.0,"There's one punch Tyson threw that always blows my mind. I forgot who he was fighting, but he was knocking the guy around a bit, dropped him once or twice. The ref broke them apart clean, then as the guy approached Tyson, Tyson cocked back his right fist like it was spring-loaded, and then BOOM, he delivers a straight right dead into the poor guy's face.

I'm 99% sure the ref called for the bell before the dude even hit the canvas.

ETA: [Found it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SzUaFqra_8) It was Michael Jack Johnson that he destroyed."
StardewValley,fc9ku3d,t1_fc7s78n,1577554152.0,"Ah, I see. I unlocked the theater in the last week of fall, and the one time I was able to go in, there was already a guy blocking the crane game so I couldn’t use it.

I am trying to get all 8 movie posters now, but it’s gonna take a long time."
StardewValley,fc7jc6p,t3_egidil,1577509250.0,"Damn, that is so much nicer than the museums I made (one small one for the artifacts, one for the minerals). I still have to complete my collection with another scapula, though (I also built one for the fish collection too). But still, this is really cool looking. Also, where did you get the snake pillars?"
hockey,fc1xlez,t1_fbxci00,1577332854.0,"But it's a little crazier for the Pens, considering they had 8 fewer playoff wins. I think that was the season they went 15-0 in March."
