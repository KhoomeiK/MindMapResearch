This is one of the questions we get most often, and it's important to us. Our subreddit is intended to provide transcriptions for those who rely on text to speech or other assistive software, or Redditors who may be unable to view the image. Images of text are terrible for the vision-impaired and others who rely on text-to-speech software to enjoy Reddit, and we've also found that some people just like reading them in the comments rather than viewing the image or video. Whatever the reason, taking content and transcribing it is what we do. No matter how short and simple, or long and complex."""
