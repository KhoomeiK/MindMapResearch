Showerthoughts,fgryyyy,t1_fgruj3t,1581063288.0,I think someone actually did a study and chronic procrastinators do the best under pressure because they typically never attempt to do the work not under pressure and it becomes a habit. I’ll see if I can find a link after I’m done procrastinating my chem lab ;)
todayilearned,fgryis7,t1_fgrwis4,1581062717.0,Thank you this is amazing
todayilearned,fgryenx,t1_fgrx57i,1581062576.0,Jesus
todayilearned,fgryaxr,t1_fgrs0uo,1581062446.0,I’m pretty sure that giving babies Valium to make them stop crying was a common practice for decades.
juul,fgon2fi,t3_ezb1nf,1580976727.0,The splitting headaches on the 4ish day were what got to me
juul,fgomvof,t1_fgnoub6,1580976478.0,Yeah these are great. Really helps to get rid of the headaches.
WTF,fgn6qtb,t3_ezbw1j,1580938756.0,"I definitely knew that Bald Eagles were doing well when you see them flying around the Menards parking lot in northern Wisconsin like regular seagulls lol. 
It’s crazy how their population rebounded from the days of DDT....."
AskReddit,fgn6cgl,t3_ezauxv,1580938546.0,"My dad taught me this one a long time ago, but the simplest thing to remember is people naturally guard their head, so fake a punch to their head with one hand and drill them in the gut with the other.  Most people don’t handle getting drilled in the gut too well..."

LifeProTips,fgn3xul,t1_fgn0qaf,1580937240.0,Or you can find a new song you’ve never heard before each day that you like based on your mood and figure out which of your existing playlists it belongs in. That’s fun too.
LifeProTips,fgn3nvv,t1_fgm0dy5,1580937087.0,I love mobile reddit. Linked a bunch of them with descriptions and it didn’t save it as a draft when I went to class :/      Give me a bit and I’ll see what I can do
LifeProTips,fgmzyc7,t1_fgm9mnm,1580935095.0,"Yeah for the most part. Some of them just get deleted after a while, or the weeks kinda combine but it’s incredibly therapeutic."
imsorryjon,fglo9jq,t1_fgkwb09,1580906183.0,It’s not from an equation. You can actually use the arrow keys to move a cursor around on the graph and draw your own shapes.
imsorryjon,fglo4rw,t1_fglgp3y,1580906056.0,It works on the 83 as well I believe
college,fglnv41,t3_ez4fn9,1580905798.0,"It’s 7:30 AM right now, stared at the ceiling all night, and I have a chem quiz in two hours. Gotta love insomnia."
LifeProTips,fglnp17,t1_fglcaa5,1580905631.0,I kind of have a midway approach to that. I keep a journal but it is extremely sparatic. I can go nearly a month without writing in it and a series of events happens so I write about my day surrounding the events too. It really works for me. Doesn’t feel like a chore.
LifeProTips,fglne6b,t1_fgl6fj0,1580905330.0,I try to make a new playlist nearly every week with the mood that I’m feeling and I’ve kept the really good ones for a long time now.
AskReddit,fglmqmk,t1_fgljs1m,1580904661.0,Thank you for a good laugh lol
AskReddit,fglmgo9,t3_ez0c7z,1580904370.0,“OK Boomer” has overstayed it’s welcome
AdventureQuest,fgljehv,t3_ey95qz,1580900765.0,Same here. I don’t know why I even thought of the game but I was sitting in my college lecture and just logged on.
KimmyGranger,ffx9zv2,t3_evpxrh,1580320845.0,Anyone have a way to get the picture from her onlyfans?
AskReddit,ffusmtw,t3_ev5zdg,1580248586.0,I was very drunk and realized I didn’t have any jam for my crackers. Had a good cry over that one last night.
ClimbingCircleJerk,ffr0wj0,t1_ffqzq29,1580148019.0,This was very much appreciated
college,feaimma,t3_eo50o7,1578949257.0,"I have classes from 11- 9:30 on Monday’s. It’s totally doable. Just do yourself a favor and get a lot of sleep Sunday night. Make sure you get a chance to eat when you have to and take really good notes because your classes can tend to blend together when you’re sitting there for so long. 

The great thing about having a lot of classes on Monday is you have the rest of the week to work on assignments as well as the weekend. Typically you have most of Sunday to cram/ finish stuff up if need be. You’re gonna do great :)"
LifeProTips,feai3gj,t1_fe88ng4,1578949001.0,This is honestly why I’ve always enjoyed chat-roulette type programs. It’s great to meet new people and potentially be someone for them to talk to even if you’re states or even countries away. Different perspectives.
Showerthoughts,fdkenje,t1_fdk95id,1578502256.0,I laughed out loud at this during my COMM lecture
