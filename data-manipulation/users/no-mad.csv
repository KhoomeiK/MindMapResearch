Plumb one to the dirty water side and plumb the other into the clean side. Now you can see before and after total dissolved solids.  Rather than guessing. This will tell when the filter is no longer working. The hour-shower guy also recommends adding a teaspoon of Epson salts to the water. It causes body oils to precipitate out making them easier to filter out (my understanding of what he was saying)."
