I’m not sober and I have no intent to be. I intend to take the naltrxone every time I am going somewhere that will be drinking focused and I will have a drink there. This is the way I extinguish the link between pleasure and alcohol. And distance myself from alcoholism. 

Sobriety never worked for me  because it does not get rid of the connection and it does not allow for exposure to normal adult life. When I was sober, many years ago, I had to cut events, places and people out of my life because otherwise I would be sucked back into the habit of getting drunk all the time. Now I don’t have to avoid and I’m drinking 89 percent less than I was."

Alcoholism_Medication,fet0k4m,t3_ehcabb,1579370724.0,"TSM doc had me start right away. No trying to have AF days first. However, I was AF for about a week because I had a sinus infection which made my asthma really bad which caused severe coughing which led to a cracked rib. When I’m that half dead from sickness is the only time I don’t drink. 

So I got the rx during that time and started it the day after the talk with the TSM doc and had my first drink on it. 

My doc asked me to wait until 2 hours after I took it to drink instead of the 1 hour cause he thought it would be better for the psychological tie to drinking being my dealing with anxiety from my job. So I took it at 3:30 at work and had my first drink at 5:30. Worked immediately and the drink literally had no power over me. I drank 2 sips of wine and did not get that “feeling” that makes me keep drinking til I’m sloshed. Lost interest cause there wasn’t that feeling. Tried to drink more wine, and took another sip, but then I just let the wine sit there and I just looked at it. Amazed. 

A glass of wine has never lasted 15 minutes in front of me in my life. 

The cravings were a big problem for me and drove me to hit the bar for happy hour everyday. So I took the Nal for a while everyday and that helped stop them. 

Now I just take it when I plan to go out. And I have to force myself to drink something with it so I extinguish the connection between alcohol and pleasure. 

I was worried because I thought that I would miss the addiction deeply because it had been a part of my life and a sense of comfort when things weren’t going well or I was upset or anxious. But I don’t at all. This is very different than all the times I tried (and did sometimes) quit before. Because the longing for it was still there. 

Now it’s not and I feel free."
Alcoholism_Medication,fesxbx0,t3_eqj9j7,1579369881.0,"I find it impossible to get through an entire glass of wine on the Nal now. I take a few sips and am uninterested. 

Because I’ve almost completely stopped drinking, my time to enjoy my life, my friends, my art, reading, work, relationships and activism has expanded so much that I am thoroughly enjoying life again. 

Instead of being hung over this morning I read three chapters of a book aloud to my partner while he relaxed. Instead of taking a few hours to recover from hang over at work everyday I was way more engaged at work and better able to connect with my clients. Instead of sneakily getting my friends who don’t normally drink a lot to drink really heavily on a weeknight with me, we went out and talked for hours over dinner and one drink. 

I did not realize how much of my life I had been losing to the booze because I had not lost a job, relationship, house, education - any of the big huge things. But now that I’m off I realize I was losing the things that make me me and becoming something I did not recognize, slowly enough that neither I, nor the people I care about and who care about me, could see."

You don't have a problem""  (I think at least 4 glasses of wine 5-6 evenings a week and at least one black out a week... well if you're friends are doing that too they need help).

dryalcoholics,fdafgff,t1_fd5e1sq,1578245497.0,"First off I want to say I am not anti medication or pro medication management for mental health. However, I believe in only using meds for life optimization and to use them ethically and use the ones with very serious long term side effects very sparingly.

Gabapentin is not a scheduled narcotic in the USA.  Not sure where that information is coming from. 

Antipsychotics are helpful to stop psychotic episodes but show little efficacy long term. This person does not seem to be in any acute psychosis and antipsychotics have life limiting side effects and should talk to a doctor about options for using them only very sparingly in outpatient settings. 

Unfortunately drug companies ramped up their advertising to medical professionals when antipsychotics were being repatented as LAIs and used the very small percentage of studies that showed any efficacy for long term prophylactic treatment for people who do not have chronic schizophrenia (most of these studies are not even long enough for norms courses of mood changes in bipolar anyway). Triage medicine can give false indications that antipsychotics should be added as a primary medication because they do work short term for accuse episodes. The drug companies are now creating studies to show efficacy of antipsychotics in bipolar depression - where much less harmful talk therapy, CBT and DBT are just as or more effective. 

I work in the mental health field with people who have been on antipsychotics for many years and the long term use of antipsychotics has very significant palpable affects on the body and the brain. Is it the most effective mono therapy medication for some people? Yes, but almost exclusively with people with chronic paranoia and negative invasive thoughts or visions. But is it overused on many people where the benefits (or lack there of) do not outweigh the risk long term? Yes. 

The psychiatric field a a whole (of course their are some individual psychiatrist and NPs who do not do this) is horrible about guiding people to effective therapy to reduce mental health symptoms so that less medication can be used.

There are lots of ways to increase mental health stabilization without or in conjunction with medication (that often result in less medication being needed). 

These are some resources that may help you implement strategies to reduce problematic mental health symptoms without or with medication (your body, your choice). 

The one thing to keep in mind is that managing bipolar or schizophrenia with or without medication takes quite bit of work, especially at the beginning to build the habits to do so.

bipolar,fda55e8,t3_ek6lpn,1578241806.0,"Mood stabilizers are often enough. There are very serious long term side effects to antipsychotics, which are worse for people with bipolar, such as tardive dyskinesia and metabolic syndrome. Also for all people a higher risk of diabetes. 

Though antipsychotics can help with peripheral symptoms, there is little long term evidence that they are prophylactic for recurrent episodes of mania. Most studies show they are not, but drug companies with patents on newer meds and repatented older meds that have been turned into LAIs have over shared the few studies that show any efficacy beyond just taking mood stabilizers. (doctors and families are in love with LAIs cause they can assure that their patients or loved ones are ‘compliant’.) Unfortunately most of these studies are not long term enough for most people to get episodic again - so they aren’t really reliable at showing long term efficacy. 

So many doctors who prescribe mediations conservatively and ethically try to go just the mood stabilizer route first. And if it’s not working as mono therapy then they add antipsychotics temporarily when moods flare. 

Some people have comorbid issues that can benefit from everyday use of antipsychotics. 

To reduce lot of the symptoms of bipolar It takes quite a bit of self work, life style change, sleep scheduling and therapy. Relying only on medication is not effective and will only result in needing more medications with harmful side effects.

(I am not pro or anti medication - I merely think meds should only be used for life optimization instead of symptom reduction if they are used)

Talk therapy used to be a big part of integrating peoples experiences. But the medical model really took over and pathologized peoples experiences

There are some great things going on like Hearing Voices Network, Icarus Project, some studies about Avatar therapy for extinguishing abusive voices, and incorporation of CBT and DBT techniques specifically geared towards people who experience voices or hallucinations who want to learn to control them themselves. 

There’s lots of cool stuff going on - that can be in lieu of meds or used with them. 

it kinda sounds like you might benefit from some of Veronica Walsh’s frustration tolerance work while you figure out how you can handle the loneliness for now. And then maybe check out some alternative views of voices and hallucinations that are not so medical model/brain disease focused.

bipolar,fd57zpt,t3_ek26ve,1578175030.0,"Splitting is more of a borderline (aka Complex Post Traumatic Stress) response than a bipolar one. However many people have both or have bipolar with BPD traits. 

Because borderline requires an incredible amount of self study and self work - it’s not very responsive to medication. That is because people with it have to replace unhealthy patterns of emotion, behavior and interpersonal responses that were ineffective coping methods to deal with early trauma because no one has the capacity to deal with trauma at an early age.  Very little can be done in therapy besides direction in what resources to access and what to work on, because the work needs to be done by the person experiencing borderline - instead of a psychodynamic type of therapy where you would talk out problems with a therapist in the hopes of generating your own solutions by talking it out.

(Particularly the invega sustena and the klonopin). If you are symptomatic on lower medication and want to take less so that you can go back to reading and advanced thinking, it's important to get some serious counseling with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to learn how to recognize and replace unpleasant, unhelpful thoughts (including voices, anxiety and delusions) and behaviors with better ones and psychodynamic trauma informed therapy to reduce any residual trauma responses that may be affecting symptoms.  

A lot of people can lower the amount of medications they need to rely on with good quality therapy and hard work.  And remember that one person's wonderdrug combo is another's downfall.

You were on gabapentin which is an anticonvulsant, stopping abruptly if you are on a higher than minimal dose can cause seizures. 

Besides that there are quite a few resources out there for people who are considering trying to discontinue mediation.  You can check out The Icarus Project.  They have some good guides about coming off meds and staying stable without them as well as an online and offline presence.  It’s  important to do a bit of research into how to control your moods with diet, exercise, sleep and routine and also to create an advance directive you can give to two people you trust that has your wishes if you become very unwell and unable to make decisions for yourself at any point.

Go to therapy, get rid of substances that impact your mental health, get into a healthy routine, take medication and see if it helps and if you can convince your family to get into family therapy. They do not owe you forgiveness for poor behavior regardless of mental illness. Heavy drinking and drugging in a family can be a form of abuse. I suspect there were other upsetting things for them as well. 

The rewards of doing the work are that you will find the real you underneath all the stuff that needs to be cleared away. Hopefully your family will be able to be part of your life, but you’ve got to leave it up to them to decide that.

Just a warning: Antidepressants and bipolar are often a very bad combo that can lead to very rapid changes in mood. Stimulants can fuel that as well. 

It’s very important to get good support for yourself and to link him to support in the communities he is in.  Here are some places to look and some general advice:

1. The Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance. Www.dbsalliance.org. They offer support groups for family and friends and people living with depression and BP. 

2.  Stay away from organizations that advocate for forced treatment. You want people to be a partner in their own recovery. Some organizations educate parents that the only way to help their children is through heavy handed control,  and forced outpatient treatment. Though I agree that in extreme cases to prevent death or unrecoverable consequences, forced hospitalization is sometimes the only resort, but forced outpatient treatment is not helpful to anyone other than the people forcing the treatment. And in the long term can lead to people not taking care of their mental health at all just to maintain a sense of independence. 

3.  Check for Clubhouses in your area that provide social, educational, vocational, and other supports. Www.clubhouse-intl.org

4.  Check out College Reentry program. It’s the only program that intensively supports people with BP or schizophrenia to return to school. People go there for the equivalent of one semester and almost all go on to finish school. https://collegereentry.org/

5.  Get family therapy. Often times there is one family member who internalizes the unhealthy things that happen in families (unhealthy things happen in all families). And families have a hard time knowing how to support their loved one and how to address their behaviors that are affecting the family.  No family innately knows how to do this - even therapists because you cannot provide therapy for your own family. So get family therapy as soon as possible to start dealing with the issues as a whole unit. Even if not all members will come at first those of you who can commit now should
Start. 

6.  Realize that though you and your family may have had an impact on your sons mental health - holding onto feelings of guilt are not helpful. But it is your responsibility to work on yourself to be the best you can be going forward. All families impact the mental health of each other. All could have done better had they had the right tools. And all members need to work on themselves, their interpersonal issues and their feelings about the situation so that they can properly support not only the family member who seems to be suffering the most, but themselves as well. You can’t help anyone else if you don’t put your own health first. 

7.  Do not let him off the hook for bad behavior, overly punish him for it or coddle him too much. Even with a mental illness, people are responsible for their actions.  They should be led to understand that with their behavior they are hurting themselves and others and that it is their responsibility to own that and to work to change. That being said - overly punishing people is not helpful either.  And overly coddling can lead to disabling a person. For instance I have seen parents have their children with mental illness move back in and then they do everything for them. Then the child wakes up as an older man realizing he has no skills to live on his own and has missed years of his life. Don’t do this either. If he does move back in there have to be set expectations for how he will be a functioning, contributing member of the family and how he will work toward independence. 

8.  Self care. Maintain your friendships, your routine and your health. Family members can get so caught up with worry they get sick themselves. Make sure to take care of you. 

9.  Realize this is the long game. Because of stigma, discrimination and prejudice that leads people to ignore their mental health issues in favor of reducing the likely hood of being labeled and left out
Of society it often takes years for people to get help. I hope he does sooner but
It could take while. 

Good luck to you and your family."

If your BP is stable and there is some interpersonal stuff going on definitely as the comments above suggests DBT is very helpful. Wish you luck!
bipolar,fca49ym,t3_egow17,1577562852.0,"Borderline personality disorder is a kind of complex post traumatic stress which causes a pattern of unhealthy thoughts, behaviors, world outlooks and interpersonal interactions and responses that were probably early learned behavior to keep the self safe at one point. 

Contrary to stupid stigmatizing statements from individuals and mental health professionals alike, Most people recover from BPD, especially if they fully engage in their own recovery. But it is hard work because it’s all work on the self vs medication. Medication really does very little. 

It’s also very hard because people who want to recover have to really look and analyze all their thoughts, feelings and behaviors and slowly work to replace each unhealthy element with a healthier pattern. This take a lot of time and commitment. 

And then the stigma of the illness is really oppressive. I mean the stigma in some sense makes sense in some way because there is such an interpersonal affect of the illness, but it’s not helpful because there is no information shared that helps others understand what it is and that recovery is not only possible, but probable. 

There are a lot of DBT workbooks out there, pod casts, self study material and such and some decent personality disorder therapists and intensive clinical programs. I would shy away from member led support groups because of boundary issues that can arise without someone with a lot of training facilitating the group."
bipolar,fca2mq6,t3_eguped,1577562152.0,"I finished grad school I’m
2018. Shit was brutal with bipolar in remission and untreatable ADD (can’t take stimulants cause they affect my heart and strattera doesn’t do shit). It was a fucking shitty rollercoaster. But some things definitely helped along the way I can share. 

1. Papers and assignments would sneak up on me sending me into a frenzied state of panic and anxiety. Then one day my friend at school pulls out this one sheet of paper with all her assignments and deadlines listed by date. Very simple just one line across for each assignment. Date, class, assignment. That was it. I did that for the next two semesters and it was wonderful. 

2.  Acceptance. I spent so many days and nights in unbelievable anxiety just because I procrastinated so much on 10-20 page papers that I ended up doing them like the two days before they were do, including all the readings and outline, writing, citing and proofreading. It was so stressful  that in order to calm down enough I was having a few glasses of wine each frenzied night. But I always pulled it off last minute and got an A. But the stress was too much. So I made a pact with myself and started my process a few weeks early on the next few papers. But they turned out to be shit!  I realized that the hurried anxiety and kinda that bipolar energy that kicks in really fueled my creativity. I had to come up with some sort of solution because doing everything last minute was churning out good papers but destined to make me lose my sanity. 

My solution was to start all the research and reading a week earlier. And then like before start the writing only a few days before. I still had the burst of energy, but for a much more manageable task. Worked like a charm and I went back to my A grades.

I don’t know if those examples will be helpful to you. But good luck in your return to school!"
bipolar,fca13ty,t3_egsusm,1577561316.0,"I am living with bipolar in remission and am a therapist. My clients sometimes feel they are in love with me and we process it. It’s pretty common because therapy requires unconditional positive regard which is a form of love for someone else’s humanity - and for people who haven’t gotten a lot of that in their lives they can mistake it for romantic feelings subconsciously and then get attached and feel sexual love or romantic love. I do not get weirded out by it or any of the details accompanying it when we talk it out. It’s very normal. 

I have a story that is unrelated to therapy that maybe helpful to you. I was infactuated with a coworker. I really absolutely adored him. Loved everything about him. Then found out he was engaged and my heart broke. Went crying to a friend and he gave me sympathy I wanted and validated me and then asked me what I liked about this person. I said all the various amazing qualities and he said “well, he’s given you a gift”. I was like “what do you mean?”  He said “he’s shown you what you’re looking for now go out and find it”.

Things that can help are proper sleep hygiene, support groups (DBSA alliance - NAMI but NAMI is a little problematic), healthy caring reciprocal relationships, having a pet, working a job or going to school for something you find rewarding, eating a diet low in simple cardrates high in protein and complex carbohydrates, exercise, meditation, good therapy, family therapy, Clubhouses (see iccd.org), activism, belonging to community. Bipolar is very heavily influenced by early loss and/or trauma or neglect. It’s important to have good therapy to overcome the emotional pain and prevent recurrence of trauma. 

Love, art, music, therapy, good friends are all helpful. Routine is essential. 

Getting quality help for finding out what benefits you are entitled to is also very helpful. Clubhouses and social
