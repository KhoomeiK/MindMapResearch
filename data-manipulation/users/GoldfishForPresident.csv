dogs,fe9t0i7,t1_fe3k7cg,1578941228.0,"You may want to look into it sooner rather than later. My understanding is the meds for this condition can dramatically improve affected dogs, and are pretty easy. Personally, I'd want to rule this out right away if it is a contributing factor, before I put a ton of effort into other stuff!"
dogs,fe9nq5b,t1_fe8d230,1578939828.0,"I'm not trying to make a statement about whether a prong collar is good or bad - but in the interest of discussion, I think you should try to reframe your understanding of the prong collar in terms of operant learning quadrants. I say this because of the phrase ""it's just a signal"" - this isn't really an objective description of what's happening here.

If you are standing there with your dog on a prong, your dog suddenly growls at another dog, and you leash pop your dog with the prong so that he stops growling and is less likely to growl in the future, you've used a **positive punishment** (and probably pushed your dog one step closer to being an unpredictable fear-aggressive animal, but that may be beside the point here).

If you are walking your dog on a prong and he leaves heel position and you apply leash pressure on the prong until he returns to heel position where you release that pressure, you are using **negative reinforcement.**

If you bump your dog on a prong collar (or any collar really) for looking away from you, I'd argue that this is negative reinforcement (you are increasing the behavior of looking at you) rather than positive punishment (since the absence of behavior - ""not looking at me"" is not a behavior). If you bump/pop/engage the collar when the dog looks a specific thing (a dog, a person), then you're dealing with a positive punishment again (you are decreasing the behavior of looking at the dog/person)."
dogs,fe3neu6,t3_ennwwt,1578850964.0,"Just got back from our first ""therapy dog"" class at PetSmart (my dog will be a suitable therapy dog right after the day hell freezes over, but...) and I am mostly pleased!

The trainer lady totally knows we're not in this for actual therapy prep, and are basically just using the class as an excuse to get practice in a challenging environment. I think the environment is about the ideal difficulty for what we need, too. Only 2 other dogs are actually in the class, a floofy GSD-mix thing and a pretty sharp Belgian malinois that the guy keeps on a prong (???). The lady with the floofy GSD thing dropped her leash early in the class and the dog wandered over to mine, but I just kind of body blocked and it was OK, and Argo didn't lose his marbles and generally kept his composure.  I brought a mat for Argo and parked us at the far end away from the other 2 dogs, and I basically just alternated mat work and stepping back into the aisle out of sight of the other dogs to practice offered focus. We had a bit of whining and few barks throughout, but nothing horrendous and improvement by the end. I have to remember to pet Argo more in class, I think he actually is comforted by that!"

dogs,fdwqeba,t3_en9ouj,1578761368.0,"My guess would be swelling/bruising from a bite, pinch, or other physical trauma. (Obligatory not a vet, just a guess. When my horses nip each other, it often results in something that sounds very similar to your description.)"
dogs,fdwpscw,t1_fdwi70h,1578761210.0,"Oh for sure, the contract is probably legally unenforceable baloney - but I don't even think I would want to look that breeder in the eye, say ""yes, I agree to this,"" and then sign my name on it. (And then lo and behold, if I didn't brush my dog's teeth 3x/day or whatever, feel that ethical ax hanging over my head.) But I hear you, maybe getting a reputably bred dog from an otherwise good breeder with an insane contract that you essentially throw in the garbage is still one of the better ways to go about it."

dogs,fdwmfbu,t3_en0cdh,1578760211.0,"Clicker training is amazing, fun and easy to learn for both the human and the animal! (I second the Fenzi suggestion and Kikopup - both of which incorporate a lot of clicker or marker-based training.)"
dogs,fdwet98,t3_en8fej,1578757982.0,"I don't know that I, personally, could bring myself to purchase a dog that could be repossessed whenever if the breeder disagreed with any little thing about the way I kept the dog (or if I were to have some personal falling-out with the breeder, and they now can point to something I did with the dog in violation of the contract, that they wouldn't have otherwise ""cared"" about). I get that they care about the dogs they produce and that's obviously wonderful... but if I bought the dog, I would like to own that animal, period, no strings attached."
dogs,fdtfa7b,t3_en10pe,1578715930.0,All dogs are one of a kind! :) But that doesn’t mean they should be bred - sounds like you did the right thing by your dog in spaying.
Dogtraining,fdow80u,t1_fdokau2,1578614288.0,"""Ah-ah"" and similar are only punishers if they reduce a behavior. What if you have a dog that doesn't mind a ""strict tone?"" What if ""ah-ah"" stops acting as a punisher? If your current choice of mild punisher didn't work and you were unwilling to escalate the punishment, you'd have to find either a +R based behavioral solution or a management solution (or a combo). So, that's what I do to begin with, and just skip the ""try a punishment"" step! 

Now, I won't lie - I for sure say ""no"" or ""hey!"" or whatever when my dog is about to get into some decent trouble, I'm a human too :) but I don't plan on it, and I don't incorporate it as a structured part of training. If I find a scenario that my dog isn't safe in, of course I'll do whatever I need at the moment to keep him safe. But, then I will plan to avoid/manage/strengthen other behaviors before I put him in that situation again. I truly do not have a non-reward marker or a ""try again/wrong"" word, and I have been able to teach a wide array of behaviors just fine. If my dog downs when I cue sit, for example, I would just toss a reset treat and try again. If he gets it wrong a second time, I'll find a way to further split the behavior so he can get it right and build from there, just like I'd split any behavior in the process of training it. And if I don't know, at that moment, how to better split the behavior, I'll move on to something else, or just end our training session with our typical happy end-of-session cues and try to go think of a better way for next time."
Dogtraining,fdoek14,t3_embs1k,1578603650.0,"Two ball game! Get 2 identical tennis balls (or whatever type of ball it is that he likes). Say your word for fetch (""fetch,"" ""get it,"" ""chase,"" whatever) and then throw the first ball right after you say it. He goes and gets it and comes towards you - once he is ""close"" - like 15 feet away or whatever he does right now, say your ""fetch"" word again throw the second ball for him (and hope he drops the first). Go pick up the first ball he dropped while he's chasing ball #2. As he approaches you again with ball #2, see if you can get him 14 feet away instead of 15 feet. Walking backwards a couple steps to ""draw"" him towards you may help - you can also show him the next ball by holding out your arm with it so he understands you will throw it for him once he's close enough. Slowly over time, reduce the distance he has to be away from you to get you to throw the next ball.  15 feet, 14 feet, 13 feet, and so on."

Dogtraining,fdnsag6,t1_fdkupzu,1578591820.0,"Dogs can totally understand questions! In their own way, of course - their grammar might not be so great :) ""Directives"" are not the only thing they can understand.

But indeed, there are many trainers now that offer dogs choices, such as: which harness do you want to wear? What behavior would you like to practice? Are you ready to work with me right now? Are you willing to allow me to clip your nails in exchange for rewards? 

I'm happy to round up some links I've learned from, if you'd be interested in reading a bit!"
Dogtraining,fdnrmp1,t3_em7y1z,1578591455.0,"So, I think you may want to consider what this ""stop signal"" is, behaviorally. **The absence of a behavior (ex: ""not jumping"") is not a behavior** \- so, you can have a cue for a behavior like ""freeze"" or ""stand still"" or ""drop the thing you have in your mouth currently"" because those are all defined behaviors the dog can actively choose to do... but you can't have a ""stop"" behavior because... stop what? Stop jumping? Stop biting? Stop being in the living room? Stop looking at you?

You can have a ""conditioned punisher"" - just like you can have a ""conditioned reinforcer"" such as clicker click or verbal marker (and I certainly hope you have at least one of these!). Just like a conditioned reinforcer predicts a reward like food/pets/toy, a conditioned punisher predicts a punishment (negative punishment: removal of attention, or positive punishment: collar pop, etc.) I don't use a conditioned punisher and I wouldn't recommend one, either! It is likely, in many cases, unless your punishments are very severe, that the dog will acclimate to some level of punishment... so saying ""No, bad dog!"" looses it's effectiveness, and now you need to say ""No, bad dog!"" while yanking on his collar... and next you'll need to say ""No, bad dog!"" and light him up on the electric collar. It sounds like you're already beginning to experience this if you say you feel your ""stop signal is waning."" You've started down this road.

This is where I'd direct you to u/shiplesp 's excellent advice - if you aren't going to use a conditioned punisher (and again, I don't and wouldn't! I am not comfortable with where I feel that road will take me. And since I don't like the destination, I won't take that path.) then you need to A.) manage the environment, B.) slowly increase environmental challenges, and C.) train the heck out of incompatible behaviors that you can build strong positive reinforcement history with!"

dogs,fdcmnad,t3_ekdga5,1578278692.0,"I signed us up for 2 different training classes today... somehow, we're taking a ""therapy dog"" prep class at PetSmart even though my dog is waaaaay not cut out for therapy work (unless those old people WANT their hips broken!), but it sounds like a lot of the behaviors they practice (chin rest, polite greetings) are things we could definitely use practice on, and it's mileage.

Dogtraining,fd9nlcy,t1_fd6zjxy,1578235682.0,"I think a lot of people - and I'm definitely on this boat myself - ALWAYS give a treat after a click. 1 click = 1 treat. Therefore, you should never need to ""reload"" the clicker; it should never lose it's meaning in the first place. Instead, start asking for multiple behaviors before clicking, like:

At first: 

\-Sit > click > treat

Eventually:

\-Sit > down > sit > click > treat"
