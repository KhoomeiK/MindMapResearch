videos,ffgd9vy,t1_fff9i4p,1579903675.0,"I stayed at a Mexican all inclusive for the first time last summer and they told us not to throw away the cups. Cool, they reused them. Nothing wrong with that. Until I see workere pulling the cups out of the trash and then watch how they ""wash"" the trash cups, just a quick water rinse. My vodka soda still covered in someone else's old margarita salt. I mean I still drank but I went and got my own reusable cup from the gift shop and had them use that."
trashy,ffgbk1o,t1_fffrjoh,1579902619.0,"Usually Amazon's return window closes after a month but he could easily get past this by rebuying a new one and then returning the old. I used to work at macys and some peoples full time jobs were buying stuff, waiting til it dropped to its lowest stuff, returning it for original price and then rebuying it at it's now low sale price and then reselling. So they'd show up with 100s of the same thing and try to do it for all of it. My boss was a psycho about letting customers do whatever they want so I had to do it. That store closed."
TrueCrimePodcasts,fff8j4a,t1_ffcgpj8,1579878372.0,"You could literally turn the podcast first ep off after the first commercial break and start the second ep and not miss a thing.

 I am still listening but what bothered me was the last episode covered a crime that dealt with a community that went by a ""no snitching"" mentality and one of them just went off on the community. Said they were all pieces of shit. I live somewhere with a lot of gun violence and can tell you that it's not going to help anyone to trash an already suffering community. Maybe try to be empathetic to the struggle of people living somewhere that has serious problems that cant be written off as just ""everyone is an asshole."""
trashy,ffd0x5e,t1_ffc1xzj,1579811241.0,That's sad. I have friends whose parents have ruined their credit using their ss numbers for messed up stuff. I'm so glad I had parents that cared about my future.
oddlysatisfying,ff8pgfd,t1_ff64j33,1579690372.0,"I bought a used Mitsubishi from a Ford dealership. It was a great deal, tons of extras at market price low miles. 6 months after I got it, a drunk driver totalled my car while it was parked in front of my house. They hit it so hard it went into my neighbors front yard. The Ford dealership still calls me constantly even though I told them the story. I had to buy another new car that year but got it from a Mitsubishi dealer, same car, new, way less perks, higher payment."

todayilearned,ff457sp,t1_ff116in,1579555805.0,"Its interesting to me that someone noticed this. I have to say i would have a hard time noticing something like this but I used to live in a campus apartment with two locked doors to enter but people would hold them open for each other. One time I noticed a guy not press a floor. I was the only person for floor 6 and got in after him but he got off at my floor. 

I was afraid he would follow me so I let him out first and he luckily went the other direction and I ran to my apartment and got inside. I looked over right before entering and he was just standing outside a door staring right at me. I was just grabbing my stuff to go to work so I had to leave again about 15 minutes later. I didnt see him in the hallway but as I was exiting the elevator he was walking in with a new group of people. I went and told a nearby security about him. Not sure what came of it. He looked way too old  to be living there. We had a lot of theft in that building."

educationalgifs,fesi99a,t1_ferivjl,1579365425.0,I worked at a department store and all of the 70+ year old women who still work there still wear heels for their entire shift. Up to 8 or 9 hours. I not only dont wear heels due to the fact that I'm already almost 6 feet tall but I also would never have worn them at that job.
forbiddensnacks,fep1hyl,t1_fekltpp,1579310036.0,I used to be like you then I tried the ear plugs. I have ringing in my ear from a really bad ear infection but it doesnt seem to be an issue for it
1200isplenty,fekmkvb,t3_epert5,1579203178.0,I am like this but with mild pepper rings. So fucking good. Pickles too. Like is it normal to eat strictly charcuterie for a meal? If I dont have crackers I get more rings and cheese.
forbiddensnacks,feklo66,t1_fekkx1d,1579202634.0,I use the softer versions of these every single night for sleeping. I am such a light sleeper and started using these on trips to NYC due to the traffic noises and it was the best sleep of my life so now I use them every night with a sleep mask. I still hear my alarm but it drowns out the other noises that used to wake me up all night long.

Like there I was, a normal person and they had no issues with me but because I didnt take their fucking dog to the pound to get back at them or light their clothes on fire on the lawn I guess I wasn't as attractive to them."

pics,fe0lpe7,t1_fdy0kz9,1578815691.0,I worked at a family owned carwash. the one son had mental problems and it wasn't uncommon for him to lose his cool and punch holes in the drywall in our shared work booth from time to time. One day his mom (the owner) asked the manager to patch up all the holes. After a days long work of patching punched holes the manager was like FUCK THIS and punched a new hole. It was pretty funny to us at the time. We were all kids and did stupid stuff fairly often. I started working there at 15 and none of us were out of high school when this happened.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fdyz8v3,t3_en9ofv,1578785076.0,"My grandma always seemed nice growing up. Wasnt til I was an adult that my mom told me how she really was. My mom got a job at a local general store at 15 and came home with a bag of expired makeup they gave her that they were gunna throw out. My grandma called the cops when she found it, assuming my mom was a thief because she knew she didnt make enough $ for that much makeup."

I kinda stopped commenting as much the past few years because I dont really care to share my opinion as much anymore. I also dont want people spending their money awarding my comments, like donate that $ to some better cause please lol."

Shes a character that I thought I wasnt gunna like but ended up really liking. I also think she looks good in the traditional Korean marriage outfit that jihoon's family put her in.

It's also weird that I know so many people who have hit and killed people with their car. I know another person who was drunk and did it and obviously got jail time. I also got hit with a car once while walking and the person didnt stop but I was fine so I guess it's ok."

cringepics,fc4jdz4,t3_efvd8w,1577418379.0,I know a lot of people who seem to have trouble letting go of old relationships. I have had many substantial relationships and have been able to get over them to a weird degree. It made me feel like a serial killer or something until I met someone that I couldn't get over. I obsessed about him for years. He never wanted a serious relationship. It's been 7 years and a relationship in between and we are finally together and I feel like I  will not be ok if we break up. Guess this is love.
