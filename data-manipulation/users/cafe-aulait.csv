I ate it."
MakeupRehab,fd3jhsu,t1_fd2pces,1578158931.0,Same. Only time I don't is if it's one that I don't really like but forced myself to use because I don't want to be wasteful (both with product and money). Then I get rid of it at around the 3 month mark. Never had a problem.
columbiamo,fd041bx,t1_fczrg9b,1578113309.0,"This place. I have never had something disappointing there. They could raise their prices by a good 30% without affecting how often I go. 

The asada burrito is my favorite, but if you go when they're making pupusas... Omg."
kansascity,fcuyo0m,t1_fcudvi7,1577991150.0,"I'd do it, too. Gotta capitalize while you can."
kansascity,fcur6iz,t1_fcubgcg,1577986835.0,"Remember when his girlfriend posted a posed ""influencer-style"" photo at the stadium with a caption about how her stepdad died? That was weird."
loseit,fcuet8q,t1_fcu4dfi,1577979241.0,"This is so true. On highly active days, I'll tack on 200-300 calories just to keep myself from getting hangry and tired, but that's only when I know for sure that I used more than that. Otherwise, you have to use sedentary numbers. It's too easy to get it wrong in a way that would wreck your progress."
loseit,fcs9g1h,t1_fcrj5l6,1577913343.0,Almost exclusively drink hard liquor (whiskey or gin) with zero-calorie mixers now if I go out. Beer is a treat with dinner on special occasions. It's just too many calories.
Sephora,fcqzl9g,t1_fcqxlqu,1577894571.0,"Honestly, as if it wasn't bad enough being KVD, it was a blister pack!"
kansascity,fcp2oq2,t1_fcof39z,1577848627.0,This is the most depressing thing I've ever read. Well done.
lookatmydog,fcns69t,t1_fcnrirx,1577817400.0,"Awwww, thank you for taking care of him! He's probably terrified and confused. Give him lots of love and patience. Mine was also sick when we got him, though not as bad as yours. Eventually he started trusting us, and he's now affectionate and attentive! Rescues are the sweetest <3"
lookatmydog,fcnr4cs,t3_ei4qd8,1577816858.0,I also have a lab-dane mix. He's the sweetest boy. Be prepared for a headache during adolescence!
BeautyGuruChatter,fcn5gyk,t1_fcmyy0c,1577803782.0,"There have been some other BGs that transitioned into that content that I found to be very snooze-worthy (could just be that I'm not a SAHM and so I don't relate, but frankly, I don't find that to be very interesting content), but Tati could definitely do this as she moves to Seattle. I'd watch."
MakeupRehab,fcn4xdy,t1_fcm0n0o,1577803369.0,"I have some serum/moisturizer that also works really well as a natural highlight. I can't even remember the last time I used actual powder highlight anywhere except my inner corners. At this rate, I won't need a new one until 2030."
Sephora,fckmso4,t3_ehn60f,1577728722.0,Benetint in the mini size. I bought it in October 2018 to take on vacation when I was only bringing a carry-on bag. I've been using it since then and it's still like 1/3 full. It's only a little more per ounce as the full size ($18 for 6 mL vs $30 for 10 mL). And it lasts so long that I would never want to buy the full size. It'd go bad before I even used half of it.
