Anne,ff901t7,t3_ero437,1579701366.0,My mom texted me to tell me that my dad wasn't handling this episode very well lol
Anne,fewimyu,t3_eqije6,1579411301.0,That's cool
AskReddit,fewha8n,t1_feu6uhx,1579410564.0,I was in a car accident when I was 9 - we were t-boned and spun around as well. I remember thinking it felt like we were going soooooo sloooooowly. So weird.
AskReddit,few5r2w,t3_eqies2,1579405787.0,"When I was a kid sleeping in bed one night, I woke up and there was an elderly man sitting at the foot of my bed just softly stroking my head.  Definitely not my dad.   I was actually cool with it and went back to sleep, and I assume to this day that it was my grandpa?  


Around the same time, I went into my room one day and saw one fake flower sitting on my dresser - my parents and brother flatly denied putting it there (and there was no reason why they would put it there, or lie about it) and to this day I don't know who left it there."
Anne,feh6ls6,t3_ep47hs,1579110225.0,"They haven't released a date yet, the idiots.  They don't have the rights to air it at this time.  


You can watch it on CBC Gem or Rogers on Demand."
RoswellSeries,fdxphql,t1_fduol9h,1578771552.0,"It’s very wooden ( but I agree about him, he is by far the most charismatic and dynamic person onscreen for this show )...it also looks a bit cheap? I can’t figure out why but the production quality is just now there. Maybe it’ll improve."
Anne,fdxncqq,t3_emtap1,1578770912.0,"The writers didn’t know the show was ending until it had already aired on CBC. Unfortunately, there was no happy ending for these kids."
RoswellSeries,fdrqwl2,t3_ems2bf,1578688272.0,"All looks aside, this new Roswell NM show is just not good."
dogs,fdrq1yt,t3_emqkwq,1578688030.0,RIP to your sweet boy
Anne,fdjxgrh,t3_elk1uy,1578490589.0,"If you have a Rogers box, you can also watch it on Rogers on Demand."
Anne,fdbi6gr,t1_fd8xf14,1578257603.0,"Because of who currently owns rights and for how long. Nobody knows what contracts are involved but - I can only assume if someone shelled out enough money, then that money would cause some movement."
Anne,fd6vl11,t1_fd3ompd,1578196278.0,"From her Instagram posts it sounds like they really did try, but were told no.  I don't think she can (legally?) actively campaign online for a renewal.  She has 'liked' several things from fans about renewing the show, though."
Anne,fd6vfp6,t1_fd3opgw,1578196224.0,"Alot of fans were tweeting @ him about the show, and it seems he noticed and was nice enough to tweet that.  Pretty awesome."
dogs,fcu8vuj,t1_fcu8ti5,1577975328.0,"I'll try that - it just seems so bizarre that he's never had this issue before, and we haven't changed his feeding schedule once since we got him as a puppy."
dogs,fcu8roj,t1_fcu8098,1577975246.0,"That's interesting - ours has a weird relationship with water, he won't drink very often but drinks a ton after eating.  He also has water in his crate, which I have seen him drink from numerous times, but not every day by any means.  I wonder if there is some way to entice him to drink more?"
belowdeck,fcn8njg,t3_ehusot,1577806113.0,Imagine telling a woman to sit on your face but then throwing an absolute tantrum when she asks how your mother is
Anne,fcn7w0e,t3_ehzh1n,1577805562.0,"At this point we have nothing to lose - anything we can do is better than nothing!  


The fan billboard campaign is still a-go too, just waiting for some dates etc. and then we'll hopefully get one or two up before the end of January, minimum."
Anne,fcn7tfy,t1_fcn5f5o,1577805511.0,"So did the creator of Lucifer, who also told fans there was nothing they could do."
toronto,fbskq8e,t1_fbnl4v7,1577056569.0,Ugh that’s bs
