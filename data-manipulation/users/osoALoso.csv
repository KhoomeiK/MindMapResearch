history,ff0d05w,t1_ff0arsi,1579467711.0,That is a completely separate argument here and wholly moot point in regards to the prevailing religions in China being so far from what Lennon and Marx experienced. The driving factor of China's commu is push to get rid of religion had nothing to do with the heart of communist/Marxist ideologies. It was solely for power.
history,ff09hmj,t1_ff05q5i,1579466630.0,That's not just his opinion. It's fact. We aren't discussing the inherent philosophy of communism we are discussing what happened in China under the communist party. Their purge of religion was actively to creat power vaccums that they could then move into and control and when it failed they started state sponsored churches.

AskReddit,feofaua,t1_fenc6f3,1579299371.0,"This is not accurate. Amtrak gets priority. There are stringent laws about passenger rail due to the railway law and the changes that occurred when amtrak was created. There are exceptions to those rules for certain goods (certain hazmats or critical need shipments) but overall. Freight comes second to passenger. The issue is passengers trains dont run on time and can get delayed by freight once its already on the line, the majority of railway is single main, meaning there is miles and miles of one track and they would have to wait until freight can clear up at a siding before they can enter the line or until the block ahead of them is clear."

todayilearned,fe6ny6h,t1_fe6k5kl,1578897557.0,"Nah man. We have had such an influence on our world that by our industries and way of life we exert a substantial influence on our ecosystems. So much so that with out active mitigation of thsy influence through planning, population control, seasons and reintroduction of species in decline, the whole thing gets wiped out. I'm a hunter, but I'm not some backwoods redneck. The science is there, people choose not to see it. White tail deer almost went extinct and we brought them back, the US has one of the most successful habitat and wildlife restoration and management programs in the world. That is paid for by hunters and shooters. I don't care what side of the isle your on, hut almost 80 cents on every dollar for wildlife, wetland habitat, reforestation, species management and reintroduction, studies on disease and population, monitoring of species close to collapse etc. It comes from hunters and ammunition sales.

I'm not arguing that it's the best way, I'm arguing it is the best way right now in the world we live and active denial of it does nothing to see these species  continue into the future. I want wolves and bears and elk and moose and pheasant and quail and everything else we can have and sustain on the landscape. I want them there for people to video and watch and hunt and be in awe of nature. Shooting a wolf doesn't change that. Hunting tag management works. It has worked here and will continue to work here because we all want these species here, alive and on the landscape to be in awe of. We want them to be healthy and not have to watch them starve to death because someone had their sensibilities offended with the way management works. Tags provide money to further ensure their well being and are a net gain for the animals and tax payers. Taking that away makes it a burden with the animals suffering and tax payers taking a hit. See California and cougars as an example."

I have some great atheist friends, some great agnostic friends and then, there are in turn, these people that we all despise that clamour on their hills of intellectual superiority and come to preverbial fisticuffs to assert their independence from the other ""lesser"" all while screaming for some sort of validation until their voice cracks and they are left only to be consoled in the whimper of bitterness and contempt for their fellow man"
