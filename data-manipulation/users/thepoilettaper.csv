Sneks,fdn3h1p,t1_fdmeveh,1578576179.0,I've had trouble with humidity and I've been recommended by others that PVC might be the best bet. I looked into it more and I also like how the enclosures look/work. Reddit users have been really helpful with questions like that.
dogs,fdjn0on,t1_fdj3byi,1578478806.0,"Yes this is what happens and it is not ok. The city where I am from this is the case. In a lot of areas it is seen as a status symbol to own an intimidating pit bull. Some of these people genuinely care for their dogs and the dog might not be aggressive in any way, but other people do mistreat them. As a pit/bully breed mix (a rescue dog) owner this is something I am aware of and one of the reasons I now choose to adopt bully mixes. (#1 reason is I love them and their sweet personalities. Raise any pit or bully mix from puppyhood, before someone has had the chance to taint them, or give a well adjusted adult a chance and you will see what I mean.)

In the context of OPs story, some suburban families also choose pit bulls becuase there are lots of them who need homes and they are often people friendly dogs who love children. Some people who get them just can’t handle the dog and aren’t prepared to deal with any challenges. Truthfully this is the case for many dog breeds but with pit bulls there is an extra sense of responsibility - if they end up aggressive in any way or even display behavior that could be misinterpreted, you can bet absolutely no one will cut you any slack. (Not talking about the people in OPs story. They deserve legal action.)"
dogs,fdi4ple,t1_fdha46h,1578435693.0,"I agree. The downvoting is obnoxious. These are just people trying to offer kind words. 

Pit bulls end up in the wrong hands because they are readily available and usually people friendly. Dog aggression is common (because real pit bulls were bred for that trait) and the average person doesn’t know how to handle that. 

A bully breed/mix is a lot of dog (I own one) and if people want one they need to be educated and dedicated."

dogs,fcvs8nv,t1_fcvpfne,1578008936.0,I’m sure in the future if you try again it may work out. Sometimes it helps if you already have a dog.
dogs,fcvp3t8,t1_fcvopqe,1578006921.0,"I totally get where you’re coming from and I don’t disagree. Rescues just tend to get many, many applications (especially for the puppies or most easily adoptable dogs) and they’re almost always working on a volunteer basis. Time is very limited. If they could visit every home of who applies, I am sure that they would. Unfortunately oftentimes they are forced to rule out certain applicants who are determined less “ideal” right away. And like I said, they don’t know you personally or your character. It’s simply not possible most of the time to give a thorough review of every single person who applies."
dogs,fcvo2b6,t1_fcvi0zk,1578006266.0,"For sure. The thing is that rescues don’t know you personally and they don’t have any way of knowing what will happen after the dog goes home with you. 

Most of the people who don’t have fences and have dogs escape, it’s not because the dogs run out the door. It’s because MANY people let their dogs out freely in the yard anyway. I can think of 4-5 of my neighbors within a 2 block radius of me who do this. And I know they don’t have invisible fences, because dogs have run into the street to greet myself and my dog. 

So like I said before, they’re trying to cut down on the likelihood of something going wrong. Some of them might be overly strict, but it’s usually because they’ve seen it go badly before. And the dogs who wind up in rescues have already been dealt less than ideal cards in life, so they’re only trying to do right by the dogs. 

I know that this isn’t true in your case. Like you’ve explained you sound like a responsible owner who doesn’t let your dog run around the neighborhood off leash. It’s simple very common that people do this. 

There ARE rescues out there who will adopt to people who don’t have fenced yards or who live in a condo/rent an apartment. And some rescues who normally have these policies will make exceptions depending on the dog - for example they might adopt a toy dog or a senior dog into an apartment with no yard, since those dogs will need less outside time anyway. 

I really appreciate that you made the effort to rescue before you went to a breeder. I wish that more people did this instead of purchasing a dog right away. I just don’t want to give anybody reading this the impression that going for a rescue dog won’t work out/isnt worth the effort."
dogs,fcvhjk9,t1_fcvhfrz,1578002223.0,I appreciate that your situation is different! I understand that.
dogs,fcvgkip,t1_fcvgal9,1578001645.0,"I don’t think the goal is to just exclude people for factors like having a fence, but rather to cut down on the likelihood of dogs being harmed or returned to the rescue. I made some more points in my most recent response above."
dogs,fcvg06x,t1_fcvfkdf,1578001308.0,"I definitely understand that it’s frustrating - as I stated, I’ve had trouble getting approved and I’ve been turned away for the same reasons in the past. 

I don’t think they’re always trying to rule out for BAD adopters but sometimes they’re also trying to rule out things that are accidents or out of anyone’s actual control. For example a person without a fence might be a good owner but accidents happen, and the dog could escape. Or a person living in a condo or apartment might be a good owner  but their neighbors could complain about barking and their dog ownership/living situation could be threatened.

The goal isnt to exclude groups of people but rather cut down on the likelihood of something happening to the dog or the dog being returned. 

There’s so many factors at play and while I do think it’s a good thing to give people a chance who maybe do live in a condo or don’t have a fence, I do understand why some rescues are very strict. I would agree tho that it’s only fair to actually speak with applicants and maybe do a home visit before they are automatically rejected for things involving their living situation."
dogs,fcvchy2,t1_fcva7a7,1577999218.0,"I never used to understand why rescues were so picky. I myself had a hard time getting a rescue for a while as well. It eventually did work out and I’ve had 2 rescues dogs. 

Then the trainer who we work with for our current pup explained something that happened to her that put it into perspective for me. She’s not a “rescue only” person by any means - she used to have rescue dogs and work with rescue organizations but currently she has breeder dogs. 

She told me a story about how she took in a rescue German Shepherd and he was a dog who had been through a lot and they had to do a lot of work with him training wise, because of anxiety and past neglect. And they also had to go through quite a bit to rescue the dog in the first place. She fostered and worked with him for over a year and eventually found what she thought was the perfect home with responsible people. 

What ended up happening was, these people did not have a fenced yard and shortly after he was adopted, the dog was allowed to escape. He got hit by a car and was killed. 

She contacted the family to check how things were going and they just matter of factly told her he got killed, and they didn’t show much remorse or even emotion. It really, really hurt her and broke her heart. She said after that happened she truly understood why rescues tend to be so strict. 

Obviously not everyone without a fenced yard or who lives in an apartment or condo is going to be an irresponsible owner. (I don’t have a fenced yard myself, tho I will be installing a fence this spring.) But the dogs who come into rescues have typically been through a lot - if not abuse or neglect, many of them have been passed around which can be traumatic in itself. And the volunteers who work with them really pour their heart and soul into rehabilitating these dogs and finding them forever homes. 

The rescues are simply doing everything they can to ensure that these dogs will be happy, healthy, and safe, and they’re trying to rule out ahead of time any foreseeable reason why the dog would have to return to the rescue. Giving away dogs more liberally to allow room for more dogs doesn’t exactly work if a greater number of those dogs are just going to be returned. Sometimes this does mean they have to pass up perfectly good owners are adopters because of their living situation or other things. 

Your living situation and work schedule sounds like it’s great for having a dog, but other people who work full time and live in a condo might run into issues with dog ownership. It’s not unheard of, in fact it is common. It just really opened my eyes to hear that story about the rescue GSD and it gave me a lot of perspective."
dogs,fcsvnh4,t1_fcsvjsr,1577926270.0,Interesting. So I’m guessing the big nips are because of the hormones from reaching sexual maturity before she was spayed?
dogs,fcsbt3z,t3_eikz8r,1577914341.0,"I have a rescue Boston terrier/bully mix myself (she’s probably boxer or pitbull or a mix of any bully breeds really, but she is confirmed 50% Boston). 

I can totally see how a dog like yours or mine could become a complete handful and totally out of control without proper training early on. Luckily I’ve had my girl since she was 8 weeks old and I’ve been working with her ever since. She’s on round two of obedience classes (at a training center in a small group, I decided to go a different route than puppy class at PetSmart for example). I had a scary situation with her when she was only about 6 months old because she had a fight with another female and it really shook me, so I’ve been taking training super seriously ever since. She’s doing well, but it’s a big job. Right now she’s only 9months. She’s also 50 lbs of muscle just like yours, and she has a powerful bite. Basically what I’m trying to say is you’re not alone. 

Professional trainer is a must, so I am glad to hear you are getting one. I’d agree with what others said about 2 weeks not being enough to see significant progress. If you’re really set on giving this dog a chance, you need to have the resources and emotional space to give her a few months at least.

If 2 weeks is all you’ve got, I’d plan on giving her back to the rescue or if it would be better, find a really good rescue who take problem dogs. 

If you need someone to talk to, please feel free to DM me. I’m not a trainer or an animal professional in any way but I have had to give up a dog before and it truly sucks."

But I'd like to see the law protect the welfare of animals who are being exploited for monetary gain or just being bred irresponsibly. Puppy mills, backyard breeders, etc. There are some breeds of dogs that are deliberately bred for physical traits that cause huge health issues - I'm not saying this should be illegal but it should be raising a bigger red flag than it generally does. There are so many dogs sitting in shelters and being euthanized because they can't get a home, so if dog breeding was regulated somehow maybe these numbers would decrease.

Unfortunately I see these types of laws being nearly impossible to enforce."
vaginismus,fcm6o1q,t3_ehukqr,1577765619.0,"Yes. My physical therapist used a biofeedback machine with me a year ago when I first started.

I was at 30! Without even consciously doing anything. I thought I was relaxed.

dogs,fcllo2o,t3_eho07v,1577750695.0,"My husband and I both suffer from anxiety and depression. I’d like to add the caveat that we control our symptoms with medication and/or therapy, but having a dog definitely increases both of our quality of lives. I think especially for my husband. 

He falls more on the anxiety side of things whereas I usually fall more on the depression side. After a frustrating day at work I see how much it relaxes him to interact with the dog. It is obvious how much pure joy she brings to his life. He gives her a little piece of happiness every day that he seemed to have been missing when we were dogless. 

I work from home so I am with the dog basically all the time, and I do the great majority of her care. For me, having the dog definitely gives me more purpose and prevents me from lazing around like a lump as often as I probably would otherwise. I walk her just about every day (unless the weather is unsafe like in the New England winter), usually choosing forest trails or walking paths by the river. It’s so relaxing and good for my mental health, but I know I wouldn’t do it without the dog. 

She’s truly the love of both of our lives, besides each other. I spend most of my time at home, and we have a lot of love to give as well as the resources, so we plan to adopt a second dog in the future. 

If you’re on the fence about whether the responsibility would depress you more, I really don’t see that happening for most people. The thing you really want to consider is if you are in a place where you can give an animal the best possible care, and all the things it needs and deserves. If you literally don’t have the emotional capacity to devote to another living thing right now, I would wait."

dogs,fc5xqrk,t3_egbn40,1577468095.0,"I agree with the statement “if you can’t afford a dog don’t get a dog.” To me it DOES NOT mean “if you don’t have a 5+ figure savings account for if your dog needs chemo some day, don’t get a dog.” 

To me it’s more about the day to day costs and the fact that some people don’t understand this - either because they had dogs when they lived at home with their family and their parents paid for the costs, or because they’ve never had a dog at all. 

Most people in the year 2019 don’t have tens of thousands of dollars put away in savings for emergencies. These costs CAN arise with having a dog but I don’t think you need to have a $20,000 dog emergency fund to adopt or buy one. I don’t have a hefty savings, I am in my 20s, have debt, and own a home. However, I have vet insurance and credit cards so if it happens, I have the means to get through it. 

There are people who genuinely skimp or put off vet care because of the cost. Either they can’t afford it or they don’t want to prioritize it. There are people who don’t spay or neuter because it costs money, not because they plan to show or breed their dog. To me, that’s a problem. These aren’t emergencies warranting large sums of thousands of dollars, they’re normal costs of having an animal. 

There are “poor” people who have dogs but it’s all about priorities and the sense of responsibility to care for the dog. My husband and I had a dog when we were financially struggling a lot more than we are now but we had plans in place for when things could potentially go down an expensive route. You don’t have to be wealthy or even well off to have a dog. You just need to be aware of the fact that there are routine costs associated with dog ownership and it can be expensive, and ideally have a way to get through it if the worst happens."
dogs,fc5i8ub,t1_fc5hd3q,1577458329.0,"I’ll chime in!

So it definitely depends on if you get a puppy or adopt an adult dog. My last dog was an adult rescue and the start up costs were lower. Basically I had a $450 adoption fee and some vet costs, bought her all needed supplies to start off. Including initial vet visits and the adoption fee I’d say in that situation $1000 is a fairly accurate estimate. 

If you get a puppy the costs will probably be higher especially for the first few months of its life. I got my current dog at 8 weeks. She was also a rescue so I only paid an adoption fee (as opposed to the cost of buying), this time it was $200. She went to the vet for vaccines until she was all set with those around 4 months old. I probably spent around $600 on those visits. I also needed a dog walker to come almost every day (I work from home now but back then I did not) because she couldn’t be left for long periods of time. I signed her up for training classes and the trainer I go to charges around $160 for each course. So far we have done two. 

Also, consider the costs of spaying/neutering. This is particular important if you buy/adopt a puppy and you are choosing to do it sooner rather than later. We decided to wait until our dog was closer to the one year mark to get her spayed, but of course many people choose to do this around the 6 month mark. 

I’d say, to be safe, on top of your adoption fee/breeder price for the dog, plan to have at least $1,000 saved up for initial costs. You can get by with the basic supplies to start off with so mainly you need the money for all those vet visits."

In my opinion, toys labeled as “tough” are mainly a marketing ploy. My dog destroys all Kong toys (except for the original Kong treat toy) and everything else I have bought her that is supposedly for super chewers. 

In a typical day, my dog entertains herself with chews and whatever toy she is working on destroying at the moment. Leather toys and SOME rope toys last us a bit longer.

It is possible that your dog is just overexcited by the child.

I have a mixed breed (Boston terrier and bully breed) and we were at the dog park once. (I don’t much like the dog park anymore because of the type of people I run into there...)

My dog knows her place with other dogs, especially males. She’s acted bratty to a couple of females in her life, but with very confident females and any male, she will be submissive, and allow the other dog to initiate play. 

This day at the park there were about 10 other dogs, ALL males. My dog mostly kept to herself and played nicely with a few of the boys but made it clear she was allowing them to be the boss. 

A woman with a badly behaved pitty asked me “is your dog a rescue?” And I said “yes”. 

A minute or so later, after watching my dog play, the woman said “I can tell she has been abused.” It took me a minute to register what she said but I replied “excuse me?”

The woman said “I can tell by the way she is acting that she was previously abused.” I guess she was referring to my dogs submissive behavior to larger male dogs.

9 weeks is very young - and by that I mean you don’t have to be at a stage where you worry. I got my current dog at 8 weeks and had more accidents than successes for quite some time. 

However I do understand that it can be frustrating to clean up your floor/carpet so much and do so much laundry of blankets etc that they have soiled. 

I’d recommend taking out every half hour for now, and leashing the puppy to you when you’re home. Crate when you can’t be at their side or when you leave. Praise when they go potty outside. Feed and water on a schedule. Act appalled when they have an accident like GASP WHAT DID YOU DO!!!??? (No need to touch the dog in any way, or react angrily.) If you don’t catch them in the act or literally one second after, there’s nothing you can do but clean it up.

asl,fbywyaq,t3_edusq3,1577228586.0,"I've been learning ASL for 1 year. I have been to no formal classes and I do some study independently, but my main resource is my husband (an experienced signer) and his Deaf/HoH family and friends (or hearing friends and family who sign well). I've learned probably a smaller volume of signs than I would if I attended a year of classes or really put my nose to the grind, so to speak, with a lot of online independent learning. However, I think I have the benefit of learning by experience. I have a built in person (husband) to bounce things off of and to correct me when I make mistakes, and I am with Deaf/HoH people just about every week. So much of ASL is learned through actual practice, and having great people who interact with REALLY helps."
