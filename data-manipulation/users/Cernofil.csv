PublicFreakout,ffaextf,t1_ffabzfk,1579734110.0,"I understand that, but assaulting a person to respond to this kind of things is not a good idea... He could have gone in trouble, in serious trouble. Also what the fuck, what adult are you if you can't stay calm in this kind of situations; yeah the kid learned a lesson, never going to do that again unprepared... Remember violence creates more violence, next time the kid will have a knife.

But again, I hope you understand, I'm not defending the kid for the actions he has done and I'm not accusing the man because he stepped in, but I'm accusing the way the man reacted (what if the kid responded with a pounch uh? What would have happened, I'll tell ya, the kid would have been severely injured and the man accused by assaulting with some luck)"

PublicFreakout,ff9i4b8,t1_ff9fr5t,1579713506.0,"Yeah, like assaulting a kid by taking him by the throat. Yeah... What kind of right thing do you know? Cause I thought there were rules where you can't just go to a stranger and taking his throat and yelling at him... I thought there were laws, but I may be from another universe.

You know maybe you are right, the next time I see some behavior I don't like, Im gonna just go there and strangle him/her, cause why not? I'm doing the right thing no?

Maybe think before talking, cause it's all ok when you don't know these people, but if it was your son, then you wouldn't be that happy"
PublicFreakout,ff9h4dx,t1_ff9bz3u,1579712897.0,"He didnt actually attacked the old man, so he was kinda innocent... Well not fully innocent, but not so guilty to be strangled. Again you are acting like I was defending completely the kid... I'm not, I'm just saying there there is no one in the right: the old man, the kid and the man are all wrong somehow, but the kid and the man did worse... However continue to downvote without even thinking about what you have just watched"
PublicFreakout,ff9ac5r,t1_ff96zbs,1579708451.0,"I'm not saying the kid was right (and that's probably why people like u are downvoting me), I said that the old man should have minded his own business, but yes, the kid definitely overeacted, but he still didn't deserve to be taken for the throat. Have you ever heard of the ""everybody is innocent until it's proven the opposite""? Well, the dude that strangled the kid definitely didn't heard of that"
PublicFreakout,ff96oqz,t1_ff8r9ir,1579706117.0,"I fucking hate when people don't mind their own business, I mean ok, the kid was swearing, so? Just leave him alone, he won't continue forever. Then he overeacted and ok, he was wrong, but for me not so wrong to be almost strangled by a fucking stranger. Everyone was wrong here, especially the kid and the man at the end (downvote me, but it is like that)

Edit: for those who don't understand, I'm not defending the fucking kid, I'm just saying that what you think is the good man just strangled a kid, so please think about who is in the right in this story (spoiler: noone)"

I think you made the right thing, even if I wouldn't have done a thing like this, but that's because I'm a totally different person.
