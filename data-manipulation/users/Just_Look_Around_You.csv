MealPrepSunday,ff2wgf3,t1_ff2nd6j,1579526740.0,"Or maybe, if you stop to think for more than 10 seconds critically, you’ll realize that a lack of focus on nutrition, widespread historical poverty, and lack of variety in ingredients will lead to a cuisine not chock full of health. And my family having that lack of nutritional focus is not the outlier in that regard - it’s the norm across a part of the world that had these problems. Nobody wants to say that a cuisine is bad in any way because the reaction is that you’re offending those people. But, the truth is that not all cuisines are created the same for many aspects. To think they are is a lack of criticality that makes anything you say (good or bad) about a food completely meaningless. 

Look similarly to the kitchen of African Americans that was formed on a similar basis and find the same pervasive lack of nutrition."

Very healthy food is green, has a ton of protein, or it has vitamins or fibre or it has some certain probiotic elements. You know, actual healthy, not just what your baba might think is healthy.

Most of which involve the notion of a “mistake” or wishing to do thing differently. But besides that bit of semantics, in the context of talking about regret surrounding an abortion, I think it’s understood that the main point of using the word regret is “would you choose differently now”. Otherwise it’s not a terribly useful topic of conversation. 

Even in the sentence you formed - if you made the right choice and said that you “regretted” it (“it” being the choice) well then that would be contradictory. Saying you regret something definitely implies you may want to do it differently. Otherwise just say it was a sad choice."

What you’re suggesting is that because cancer and heart disease both make you die, then they’re the same - they’re not because they need to be treated differently. If you treated heart disease with chemo, you would not have any luck. Similarly in this case, if you treat the fact that some media is more powerful than other media, instead of the fact that some people have more cash than others to campaign with, you’re not going to solve the problem.

Federal, presidential campaigns are as far away from the people as politically possible, so it makes no sense that you should gather votes by shaking hands at the rec centre. Those are, and have been for a while, photo ops for broadcast anyways.

tennis,fe9lyyx,t1_fe9i08a,1578939322.0,"Federer really an oddity in this generation of tennis. Despite records and numbers which may, in the end, favor Nadal or Djokovic, Federer has always felt like the true goat for having a style. He hits forehand in eastern which makes it flat, fast and not so spinny. Eastern is the simplest and most obvious way to hit a ball, and it’s how almost everybody starts tennis thinking they should hit it. But it is crucially prone to error. 

Djokovic is instead hitting the standard for our generation. Semi western (I’m pretty sure) which is consistent, spins, kicks off the court but not as powerful. 

What’s important to note is something I mention elsewhere. Djokovic is perfectly and very deliberately prepping his footwork patterns, while Roger is a lot more slack. Part of it is because semi western and spin shots demand a lot more strict prep. Specifically, you almost need to jump forward into the hit to generate the upward angle on the ball that spins it. Meanwhile, roger is hitting off the back leg and moving backwards in one shot, which is a big no-no except that he has such insane control and an eastern hit that he can hit very well from various body positions/ body momentums. His ball feel is insane for him to be able to do that. Not just to be able to do it, but for it to be part of his professional game."

The military, if they had good intel (I don’t know that they did or if they knew that they did) that they were threatened, then taking a pre-emotive strike I think is fair game. It’s a great projection of force by the US military to say that their actions have consequences and that the retaliation will leave them worse off than not. 

I still don’t know the facts of the case. But if the problem is that war could happen, well, maybe there’s actually a very fine calculus from the administration that it’s actually not a realistic risk. Like if in 6 months there’s no war, and this is where this aggravation ends, the US has come out very strongly on top in the sense of protecting its own military and deterring provocations.

That agrees completely with what you said. Sure, there’s some set of points in which you will trip the net, AND it will not get you ahead in the point AND you’ll win that point - in such a case you’re saying an apology may not be necessary. I also said a sort of version of this by emphasizing that if the net chord directly or immediately causes the win of the point then you owe a Mia culpa. That scenario is also super rare as it’ll require I think another 4 shots minimum to normalize and not attribute the chord to screwing up the opponent which means you’re in rare rally territory.

And how do you know they haven’t or plan to secretly made the pledge to give up what they have?

And I don’t think you can take that position about a global fund being the only or correct course of action but that’s fine if you think so. I’m not here to tell you not to think that."
tennis,fe16som,t1_fe0o7q5,1578823140.0,"Sure. But it depends on how you think of « utility » in this case. Giving it to the wildfires is a use as well, which means that so is every other charitable or organizational donation. 

If your argument is that they can give more, of course they can, but that argument doesn’t stop being true until like they’ve given up 99% of what they have. So it’s a bad way to look at it. There’s other goals and places they may want to put that money."
tennis,fe163vy,t1_fe0ly0h,1578822974.0,"Nobody is annoyed. Well maybe you are, you’re wack. But besides you. What they’re doing is pointing your attention to the fact that the ATP guys are also pitching in and it is definitely one of the ATPers that kicked this whole thing into gear (Kyrgios). You can make an excuse for why each ATPers contribution doesn’t count or something, while ignoring those same reasons for the WTA. I have no clue why this is the hill you’re trying to die on"
PoliticalDiscussion,fdwn2pc,t3_emyt4c,1578760345.0,Who?
tennis,fdwm2gs,t1_fdw6l0s,1578760093.0,That’s what I mean. If you lose the point you don’t need to apologize for anything
tennis,fdtnqqs,t3_emxz81,1578719441.0,I loved how the crowd boos when he smacks the chair. And you can see his little villain fears turning and then he doubles it for even more boooooo
tennis,fdthzwu,t1_fdrnqk9,1578717033.0,"Yes often people do. That’s a little more of a grey area. If you get a shot you weren’t intending and it wins the point then yeah, apologize for your luck."
pics,fdrhn39,t1_fdrfvs3,1578684600.0,That’s probably even too Jewish for NY
tennis,fdrgosd,t1_fdrg6gn,1578684256.0,"Have you ever played? It’s kind of not up to you. If you took that stance and never apologized, people would think you’re a slight dick."
tennis,fdrg089,t1_fdrfm64,1578684021.0,"Mmmmm. Nah. There’s a very strong tradition of apologizing for that. It is seen as a slightly disrespectful move not to give the little sorry hand. It’s not insane not to, but it’s very much the standard to do so"
tennis,fdrfj4q,t1_fdrehob,1578683793.0,Not on serve no. That’s why it’s a let and not a point. At least that’s what I know of here
tennis,fdp6hlo,t1_fdp5n7m,1578621132.0,I guess I’ve never measured myself so maybe that’s the case for me too. I’ve kind of checked in on myself during the most intense gaming I’ve ever done and it was like maybe 130. 194 is very high. I sprint for a few hundred metres and I get to like 195. Are you sure that’s healthy?
