Well, it feels like... It feels like I lost 10 whole minutes discussing price with a cheapskate for fuck's sake ! At my hourly rate I already lost more than 4 dollars !

That's a correct reply to her message, I think."
Tinder,ffvoxuj,t3_evd6g5,1580269304.0,"Train fail fact : the French TGV once broke the record of speed for a train, going approx 575 kmph (more than 355 mph). The train still was 45 mn late this day.

I know it : I was there, I saw it. Trains being late is a secular French tradition and nobody can beat us to it. Years of practice, lads !"

For some native English speakers, ""to fall for something"" can mean ""to like very much"". I thought that ""subifellfor"" meant this. It's ""to fall"" as in ""falling in a trap"", I never noticed it.

My bad. If there's a sub to mock people, feel free to sacrifice me"

By the way, if you ever happen to believe in that bullshit she serves you, here is what you should always remember : I'm a guy who likes pretty slim girls and it never prevented me to be attracted to non-slim girls, being a little chubby or clearly overweight. My last relationship was with a very sexy, very cute, beautiful and ladylike woman weighting approx 85 kg for 170cm. Weight is not beauty and has no link to couples.

Don't listen to your mother, you're not fat and what she says about it is false and disgusting."

It's a decorative only knife, although some details about it would make decent additions to a proper knife : the gard's quillions are screwdrivers, which is in fact a brilliant idea.

Other than that, more or less everything about this knife is made for cinema. Hollow handles are bad ideas."

In French, you put a space before punctuation signs if they contain two elements : "";"", "":"", ""!"" and ""?"". I was never taught that English doesn't have that rule and noticed it myself. I still have the habit of doing it. Many people may be in my situation and may not notice it or think that the others are making a mistake since they are not alone doing that."

nextfuckinglevel,ffhglwe,t1_ffh6tca,1579934363.0,"It would be fine for a time, because it was bullt originally on an isle. The place itself was not, as it is today, linked to the land at low tides. A rise in sea level would actually do damage to the land before being harmful to Mont Saint Michel.

By the way, a little bit of trivia : this is not actually a castle, it's a monastery and, even though it is fortified, it wasn't for quite some time.

The Scriptorial, the museum in Avranches, a town about 20 km away from where you can see the rock, has an interesting section about the history of Mont Saint Michel and it's role during the Hundred Years War, during which it never was never occupied by invaders."
