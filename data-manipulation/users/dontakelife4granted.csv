There was a lady that would come in every few days and I could easily sell her $75-100 in jewelry alone when I saw her. The manager of the store told me I could probably sell snow to Eskimos. I couldn't help it, a deal is a deal and she knew it! Happy hunting!"

I always get ooohs and aaaahs from my toasted meringue. I toast very carefully so it's very toasted, but not burned. Good luck with whichever you choose!"
keto,ff6mw77,t1_ff6fc14,1579630597.0,"This is me and it took me years to figure it out. The shame from childhood had fcked me up more than I really care to admit, even to this day. It's an absolute daily grind to push those feelings away and move on to healthier thinking. It's almost like the rubber band on the wrist--think the negative thoughts--SNAP--think positive thoughts. It takes a while to get there, but every day gets a bit easier."
Baking,ff6ksbs,t3_erv40i,1579629317.0,"One Christmas, years ago, we were going over to a friend's house for celebrations and it was -15*F outside. We brought two pies, one in a box, the other a lemon meringue with a huge meringue--it was glorious!! I sat gently in the car---all was good, until I moved to get my mitten out from underneath the pie and the pie wabbled, I pushed up to right it and it hit the glove box, then flipped face down on the floorboard. I was cursing like the whole neighborhood needed to  hear me and we had to wait until the interior of the car was warmed enough to clean it up--when we got to our friend's house. I feel your pain. I'm sorry it happened to you. The good news is that it happened years ago, and hasn't happened since, so you've got that going for you. Once you do it, you will do everything to prevent a re-occurrence. Happy (stable) baking!"

Edit: On looking more, perhaps it is not flour after all, but confectioner's sugar.  ??  Edit 2: It's like a toasted sugar!! I found it woo hoo!"
Baking,ff4muzb,t3_erl6r0,1579567455.0,"Make sure your butter is room temperature (your finger can push into it, but it is stiff enough to give resistance, then whip with sugar in a stand mixer 5-6 minutes. If using an electric hand whisk, make it more like 10 min. The mix should be nearly white. After that, add in the eggs, one at a time, mixing until one egg disappears before adding the next egg in. After the eggs, add in the sour cream and and then switch to a spatula or a spoon. Combine all of your dry ingredients together well (if you have a scale, 128 grams is in 1 cup of all-purpose flour), then gently incorporate the berries into the dry (I find frozen work better, because they hold up better to the mixing) , before adding all of that to the wet ingredients. Stir only until the flour disappears, no longer. It will be lumpy and chunky, but don't smooth it out, it's meant to be that way. Hope these are better this way! Happy baking!!"

Baking,ff034yu,t1_feyrxlo,1579464701.0,"Not OP. It's not an aftertaste so much as a greasy feeling you can't get rid of inside your mouth. That's because the shortening melts at a higher temp than the inside of your mouth produces, so it (gulp) sticks longer. The fix for that is using high ratio shortening which is more expensive, but melts at the same temp as butter.  Happy baking!"
