Suicide doesn't stop things from getting worse, it prevents things from getting better. If you do act on this by February....we will always remember you. This subreddit will honor your time. My blessings man."
danplan,ff35n53,t1_ff350t3,1579534253.0,"Exactly, while yes I agree death threats go way too far. He's ruined not only the channel but the well-being of many animators. The salary he gave them is terrible! Thats below minimum wage and that is plain fucking cruel. I always thought danplan would never get into this amount of drama. I was so wrong and I hope Danplans channel dies. I used to love it but now I cant stand it. Dan finally ""succeeded"" for the moments he had. Now he's going down with the channel, sadly whether he likes it or not."
jacksepticeye,ff34rjc,t3_erah6o,1579533654.0,"""Can't wait too see my re- OH SHI-"""
danplan,ff34m26,t3_erc4eu,1579533545.0,"That is so fucking sick man. I hate that so much. We made his channel possible, but to him we're just a number? This is kinda why people need to unsubscribe. We need to show Dan that we are MORE than just an income. We are people. We made ""His"" channel..we undo that."

jacksepticeye,ferrt96,t3_eqbbs6,1579357622.0,Yesssss!! I've seen so many cruel things they've said about her and their relationship. Like stfu their amazing. As long as both of them are happy and healthy then everyone is fine! :)
lonely,fepia73,t3_eq8l43,1579321202.0,"You don't even know how much I needed this. Its not a very known topic, and people tend to just brush it off when i talk about it. Its a terrible feeling and its always looming beside me..Thank you. Thank you so much :)"

jacksepticeye,fep9o4p,t3_epvyyn,1579315264.0,"My best guess, and as some was saying, is that this is the ""anti"" version of Evelyn. Her tall figure, clearly a feminine body structure, and the long hair all point to her. Im so hyped to what backstory we can get on her."
jacksepticeye,fem3oi0,t3_epvtcx,1579238698.0,Okay I thought this could be one of the egos but I have a more clear picture. Its not. This is actually freaking me out wtf.
jacksepticeye,fem3m38,t3_epvyyn,1579238636.0,Okay. That obviously obviously look like any of the egos. Anyone have any ideas?

danplan,fekza3d,t1_feifmep,1579210708.0,"I completely get that. But what he did was really messed up. He doesn't need the eyes of the public but at least talk to Stephan. Just leaving it to ""blow-over"" is showing just how little he cares. His current fans will never forget this, and he knows that. James Charles didn't just ""wait"". He talked it out and everyone got closure. There is nothing to talk about when everything had been discussed."
