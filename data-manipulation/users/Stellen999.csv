You get all of the gooey cheese and condiments, the lettuce and tomato, and the bread, but you can eat it with a fork in the exact proportions you want. 

Theres a couple of important things to keep in mind when making it though. 

First, cook the ground sirloin (or whatever cut you prefer) and serve it up on a plate on the side. Second, toast your bun and put cheese on it to melt then cut it into cubes smaller than bite size.

 Next make your salad of chopped lettuce and tomato with condiments. I prefer to toss it in thousand island then drizzle yellow mustard on top. Remember it's going to be a very small salad. This is where you can go crazy with any combo you like. Jalapenos, sliced radish. I have even put capers in it.
