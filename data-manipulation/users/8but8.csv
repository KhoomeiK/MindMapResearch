It used to be Section 377, no unnatural sex, but in 2004 there was a case where a police officer (Annis Abdullah) had a blowjob from a girl (I remember he was a married man, and she was very young, and he then ""broke up"" with her), and she filed a police report, which got him in trouble with the law. 

This lead to a minor uproar, causing the law to be changed into no sex with dead bodies, and 377a  no buttsex for guys. 

Recently they tried to get rid of it (some people got woke after most other countries in the region scrapped this ancient anti LGBT law).

Methodology

The world’s most dangerous countries for women 2018

SCOPE

The Thomson Reuters Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Thomson Reuters, the world’s largest news and information provider, conducted a global perception poll of experts in women’s issues to highlight the most dangerous countries for women.

We set out to repeat a poll conducted by the Thomson Reuters Foundation in 2011 on the same topic that found the five most dangerous countries for women were seen to be Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan, India, and Somalia. We wanted to see if the situation for women had changed in the past seven years regarding the overall risks faced by women, and specifically regarding healthcare, economic resources and discrimination, cultural, tribal, religious or customary practices, sexual violence and harassment, non-sexual violence and human trafficking.

We contacted 548 experts focused on women’s issues including aid and development professionals, academics, health workers, policymakers, non-government organisation workers, journalists, and social commentators.

QUESTIONS WE ASKED

We asked respondents to name the five most dangerous countries from the 193 United Nations member states. We then asked them to name the worst country in each of the following six categories.

￼ Click a question below to see the polling results 1 is worst

￼ HealthcareIn your view, what is the most dangerous country in the world for women in terms of health? This includes general health access to optometrists, dentists, general doctors and specialist doctors who have expertise knowledge in disabilities, diseases or dealing with trauma. When we talk about health, we are also referring to the lack of healthcare, maternal mortality, awareness and prevention of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases and reproductive health including family planning, contraception and other general female health care.￼

￼ DiscriminationIn your view, what is the most dangerous country in the world for women in terms of the lack of access to economic resources/discrimination? This includes job discrimination; an inability to make a livelihood; discriminatory land, property or inheritance rights; a lack of access to education and a lack of access to adequate nutrition.￼

￼ Cultural TraditionsIn your view, what is the most dangerous country in the world for women in terms of cultural, tribal and religious traditions or customary practices? This includes acid attacks, female genital mutilation, child marriage; forced marriage, stoning, physical abuse or mutilation as a form of punishment/retribution and female infanticide.￼

￼ Sexual ViolenceIn your view, what is the most dangerous country in the world for women in terms of sexual violence? This includes rape as a weapon of war, domestic rape, rape by a stranger, the lack of access to justice in rape cases, sexual harassment and coercion into sex as a form of corruption.￼

￼ Non-Sexual ViolenceIn your view, what is the most dangerous country in the world for women in terms of non-sexual violence? This includes conflict-related violence, domestic, physical and mental abuse.￼

￼ Human TraffickingIn your view, what is the most dangerous country in the world for women in terms of human trafficking? This includes domestic servitude, forced labour; bonded labour, forced marriage and sexual slavery.￼

THE POLLING

The Thomson Reuters Foundation asked experts in women's issues which of the 193 United Nations member states they thought were most dangerous for women overall and in terms of healthcare, economic resources and discrimination, cultural, tribal, religious or customary practices, sexual violence and harassment, non-sexual violence and human trafficking.

>The survey involving 548 respondents was conducted online, by phone and in person between March 26 and May 4 with an even geographic spread across 5 regions – Europe, Africa, the Americas, South East Asia, South Asia and the Pacific. This approach was designed to ensure a fair geographical spread of respondents from both developing and developed countries.


https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-asia-india-42436817#referrer=https://www.google.com

>The foundation's head, Monique Villa, told the BBC that 41 of the experts were Indian. However there is no clarity about the nationality of the other experts and how widely other countries were represented

>The government has been quick to question the Reuters survey, but India has no reason to gloat - a look at the official crime statistics for 2016 shows a woman was raped every 13 minutes; six women were gang-raped every day; a bride was murdered for dowry every 69 minutes; and 19 women were attacked with acid every month.

>So does this ranking matter? Actually, it does - because it shows India has lost the battle of perceptions. And sometimes, perceptions do matter. So instead of rejecting the survey, India should do some soul-searching to see how it can improve things for its women, convince the world that it's not hostile territory for the female gender and get off lists like these."

By attack properly, we need to have video that the UC is ""renovating"" shops / attacking people AND that he is actually a UC (which will be proven when he  pulls a gun out and threatens people). 

Because everyone is filming him and people stop attacking him once he has a gun, he won't fire at people running away. If he does, that is clear evidence against the police. 

>Another thing you missed replying is that you may get wrong and left an innocent protesters injured, identity exposed and such

You only attack the UC once he is about to do something violent / or has done something violent. Innocent peaceful protester won't do violent things. 
If he pulls a gun, you run. The two people shot so far have been attacking guys with guns. UC won't shoot people running away (like Victoria Park). 

>And you seem to hold a delusional belief that if protesters or UC did nothing violent, the police will not do any arrest

I am talking about during LAWFUL protest, where people are marching on the approved route, without having any violence. 

I believe (I wasn't there) that the Sheungshui protest, people were marching on a different route, and there were firebombs thrown at the Sheungshui police station. 

>CWB on Jan 1 is not a good example for supporting your argument. HKPF are trapping people with the pretext of illegal assembly at around 6:30 (correct me if I am wrong) after they dismissed the protest 5:30 and provided 45 mins for people to disperse. TH UC acts around 3 to 5 pm (China Life Insurance and HSBC).


This is exactly what I'm talking about, how they stop the protest.

* Breach of peace happens (3-5pm)
 
* Police tell people to disperse (without enough time and blocking some roads)

* Arrest everyone

This is exactly why we need to stop the UC so not everyone gets arrested. 

Also, not everyone believes that China Life was done by a UC (my friend sent me a video link when i said it was a trap). The Police said they arrested 5 people at HSBC Wanchai. 

What I felt suspicious was that the two ""breach of peace"" was done at around the same time.

HongKong,fe2cqtq,t1_fe24cl0,1578836924.0,"The UC are never ""attacked"" properly. 

It's always a bunch of people asking ""are you UC"" and there is ample warning for them before they are actually attacked. 

It needs to be like what was done with the triads guy who had a knife in Tin Hau. 

The moment the UC looks like they are going to do something violent, you and your friends need to stop them immediately. 

The only way to do this is to have been following them the whole time. 

Don't ask if the are UC. By doing something violent they have showed they are UC trying to stop the lawful protest. 

It will be chaos. That's why you need to have people live streaming BEFORE they do something violent. 

__________________________________

Once the UC does his violent action to breach the peace, the riot police come and block all the exits and arrest everyone. Look at what happened in CWB on Jan 1.

A) You do nothing. The riot police come and arrest everyone for rioting (because there is a breach of peace). Bad PR, protest over, everyone arrested.

HongKong,fe0h8n5,t1_fdz17j4,1578813404.0,">In such a case I would propose telling people but not letting the undercover himself know. 

Yes, of course. Just FOLLOW / LIVESTREAM him with some people so he doesn't start any violence. 

>He might anticipate violence once his cover’s blown and so he might call in reinforcements right when his cover’s blown.

If he calls in reinforcements, and the riot police attack a peaceful protest, then we get ""Good PR"" and you have all this evidence on livestream. 

>I just see all these scenes of police declaring peaceful assemblies “unlawful” and I’m getting this false impression otherwise.

Yes. It's good to know what turns a Lawful assembly into an unlawful assembly. 

All our major peaceful protests have turned into violence. In the beginning, it was just at night, so peaceful people still protest in the daytime. But the December '2019 and Jan 2020 ones are interrupted in the daytime, and this is a major problem."

But there's still a bad taste from the last Jedi. 

So much unnecessary stuff. 

I was impressed that the last Skywanker was relatively straight forward."
