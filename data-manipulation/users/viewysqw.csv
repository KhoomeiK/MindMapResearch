When you lose and then pull your connection, all players in that match don't lose or gain any GSP. Toxic people do this when they lose.


Alternatively, you can create your own public or private lobbies, which are guaranteed to be on the exact ruleset you choose. You can kick people, change lobby size, and choose whether you participate or spectate.

This is due to all of Robin's projectiles (not Thoron though, it's weird) having no priority, and being destroyed by any other attack, including other projectiles. Projectile spam characters like Young Link can tap nspecial and completely counter any offense that I'm trying to push. Pichu has this, and is also the perfect height to be able to avoid all charge levels from Thunder-Thoron while running.

Hero is good and can be really fun, especially when playing local with friends. He has a decent kit aside from the down b, which people rarely seem to acknowledge. His down b can also take a lot of time to truly master, which alongside his flashy moves makes him a satisfying character to learn and play.


Joker is one of, if not the best character in the game. Just my opinion, but he's got a really cool aesthetic too, which bleeds into his smooth, effective combos.


Terry is a very versatile character. He doesn't take a lot of skill to play basically, but muscle memory and application of his command inputs is extremely satisfying to learn and play with, and good Terry players can be scary to approach, especially when he's at 100%.


Plant is regarded as a lower tier character. Slow moves, move speed, and unimpressive damage output mean that Plant hasn't had much love, aside from winning some Japanese tourneys (it was in a recent ZeRo video, the gameplay is impressive.)
I wouldn't recommend Plant though, as you don't have many options to deal with things, and it's not hard to abuse minor flaws in a Plant's playstyle.
If you were to insist on playing Plant though, the setups you can perform with your specials can be highly rewarding.
