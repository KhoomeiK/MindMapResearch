It's the result of a huge chain of people each feeling just comfortable enough to make a slight change to something slightly outside of their domain of expertise that everything literally falls apart."

spacex,ff1n1ps,t1_ff1mq2l,1579481896.0,"Yours is the most reasonable response so far. Are we 100% positive that range safety doesn't have a backup option? It seems stupid to jump straight from ""human in the loop"" to ""human out of the loop"" without passing through ""human on the loop""."
spacex,ff1jjs1,t1_fez9ybb,1579480212.0,"Challenger and every launch failure I've seen without the use of a FTS has visibly started having issues before the vehicle broke up. And when it broke up, it looked waaay more like something falling apart and continuing along it's trajectory than something exploding and just stopping in the sky. I also realize that there were SRBs involved in the Challenger incident that didn't in fact receive a destruct signal until well after the breakup, but still."
spacex,ff1inap,t1_ff0byod,1579479818.0,"People are saying this because the order of events and intensity of them do not read like something encountering a wall of atmosphere due to the lack of a nose cone, losing attitude control, and breaking up. To ANYONE who has seen launch vehicles break up. The vehicle did not seem to have any issues until suddenly it was -gone-. What we need is a step by step breakdown from Spacex about what happened here otherwise it's gonna keep looking like range safety had last minute second thoughts."

UnethicalLifeProTips,fdlf8v8,t1_fdldvhl,1578522747.0,"At a certain point it’s not about the act of cheating itself but whether the actions that lead to it are obviously gonna repeat.  Kinda like driving while drunk, the person who made the decision to start drinking excessively while being overly receptive to others is the one being held accountable, not the blacked out chick who woke up in someone else’s bed wondering wtf happened. That being said, I think it’s stupid to make sweeping generalizations about social situations and I consider most interpersonal issues individually as they happen. It’s important to recognize that everyone has the capacity to make retarded decisions once in a while, and if you can find it in yourself to let others off the hook every so often it will make you feel less atrocious and guilty when someone does the same for you."

nitrous,fdf0psm,t3_el1jrs,1578350684.0,"I haven’t, but there are a couple options to Macguyver your one. First, easiest, and most expensive option would be to go to your local machinist friend and have him make an adapter in his shop. Would likely cost you a couple hundred bucks for a part that will never break. Other option would to ditch the prebuilt dispenser and make a better and safer version yourself. You’d put a quick-release fitting on the end of the tank’s valve, and put a matching assembly onto the end of what is essentially a “pipe bomb”— a steel pipe section with two sealed end caps. One end cap would have two holes tapped into it, one to fit the filling port we just discussed, and one to fit a small pressure regulator (like a scuba regulator) and an output cutoff valve. You’d breathe through the regulator, so there would no longer be any risk of exploding your insides with a burst of gas that was unintentionally big."

resolume,fd2cgcv,t1_fd2b4dt,1578145215.0,"This is more or less a factory fresh ASUS ROG GX701 with an up to date windows 10 and Resolume install. This problem happens on both of my windows computers though. Basically, when I hold down alt-tab to switch to a different program that is open, or even hover my mouse over any open program’s icon on the task bar, windows pulls up a preview of that window on my primary display and flashes a blank desktop on any other connected hardware out. Obviously this doesn’t affect texture sharing outputs, but it will still affect any program that is receiving that texture and outputting to a hardware screen (like when use MadMapper to fuck with visuals from Resolume). I don’t imagine that this is a problem with Resolume itself, I just assumed that someone here probably would have encountered it before and had better google-fu when tracking down a fix. This would likely happen when switching away from any app that uses multiple screens like Resolume does on MS Windows. I imagine a fix would have something to do with disabling app preview windows in some sort of multitasking settings menu, but I don’t have quite the right vocabulary to describe what I’m looking for..."
