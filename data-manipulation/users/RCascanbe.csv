movies,ff7dhgn,t1_ff6uvtg,1579647026.0,"> Disagree - our brains can still tell when a stunt is real and well done.

That's just not true, look at behind the scenes stuff on modern action movies, there are usually dozens of scenes full of CGI that no one would have suspected to be fake. Especially stuff like car crashes are usually done in CG now and it has gotten so good that people just can't tell the difference anymore - if it's done well. 

> Heavy CGI tends to come with bad lighting

Where the hell did you get that from?

Dark scenes with bad lighting is only used to obscure bad, rushed CGI, good CG is easily good enough to fool people's eyes no matter how bright it is (except for specific elements like human faces, but we're getting there)."

Scientists aren't allknowing infallible gods, they are humans like everyone else. They can be just stupid, just as ignorant or just as dishonest as everyone else, so make sure to get a basic understanding of their work or look at what other scientists think of the results before treating it as facts."
funny,ff7r8x3,t1_ff7jqqw,1579656418.0,"I mean it's extremely important for scientists to question everything, even things that are seen as undeniable, but it's when you're being dishonest or when you start to intentionally ignore facts when it gets problematic.

It's mainly a problem with topics like climate change where we can't afford to debate it forever but instead have to take quick and decisive actions, but in general it does benefit science a great deal to have people argue against established theories, even if it might seem stupid."

My point is not that I can't see any benefits or why people would get sucked into it, I only think that scientology is a net negative for someone's life. 

I don't think they are helping people but instead are only using their vulnerability to gain wealth and power.

Sure you can argue that other religions are doing it as well, but not nearly to the same degree as scientology in my opinion."
movies,ff7dhgn,t1_ff6uvtg,1579647026.0,"> Disagree - our brains can still tell when a stunt is real and well done.

That's just not true, look at behind the scenes stuff on modern action movies, there are usually dozens of scenes full of CGI that no one would have suspected to be fake. Especially stuff like car crashes are usually done in CG now and it has gotten so good that people just can't tell the difference anymore - if it's done well. 

> Heavy CGI tends to come with bad lighting

Where the hell did you get that from?

Dark scenes with bad lighting is only used to obscure bad, rushed CGI, good CG is easily good enough to fool people's eyes no matter how bright it is (except for specific elements like human faces, but we're getting there)."

No it isn't, only bad CGI is. I would bet my left nut that you don't notice CGI 80% of the time.
