relationships,fffdfr1,t3_etbp13,1579881527.0,"I was also the daughter that found out my dad (stepdad) was cheating and told my mom. Honestly I was really young and naïve and didn't understand what I found but knew it wasn't good so told her. It put me in a really awkward position between them and honestly my relationship with both of them never was the same

Unfortunately, your moms made her choice. She wont leave him and you can't make her, nor change what your dads doing. They are grown adults who have to make their own choices/mistakes. My mom still stayed until they physically separated households (still married) and he brought another woman and her kids into our old home). You can of course inform her that he is continuing to cheat so you don't carry that burden, but also try not to be bent out of shape when she doesn't react the way you want her to. \*hugs\* I know its really crappy to be in that situation and I'm sorry."
relationships,ff9mgaa,t3_esff36,1579716071.0,"It can be a testosterone issue or stressors/anxiety/depression can cause libido issues as well. If you truly love this woman as you say you do, cheating should NEVER ever be an option. Rubbing one out and watching porn is different and can be an option if needed, but don't follow the advice of finding another chick (gross). I would look at those other things as maybe a cause before doing something so drastic, good luck!"

relationships,ff6u1ii,t3_erz4yq,1579634874.0,"I agree to be more strategic about who you choose to date. Ive met a lot of guys who don't care about getting to know me at all, but my last ex showed immense amount of effort and interest in getting to know me which was shocking/pleasant compared to my previous ex. Drop them if they have immediate red flags and be selective. You got this, and deserve someone who wants to know you as a person :)"
relationships,ff6t03b,t3_erza6n,1579634264.0,"I'm sorry for what happened to you. To me it definitely sounds like a HER issue and nothing wrong with  you. Definitely take some time for yourself and to heal and don't give her a second thought, I can assure you youll find someone who thinks you are amazing in all the ways. You got this :)"
relationships,ff6pz1u,t3_errfq9,1579632451.0,"Agree with previous posters, leave him. Its not worth the stress, I know its easier said than done because I've been there, but I wasted five years of my life with someone who did crap like this AND chronically talked to other girls/did end up cheating on me. Find someone who respects you and truly loves you, and love/respect yourself enough to let go of that jerk. Much love <3"

relationships,ff6jq51,t3_erxq3m,1579628666.0,Communication is key. I can see how in the moment it could be really hot to her but then after things have calmed down she may be overthinking things/have mixed feelings. Definitely talk about it and good luck! :)
offmychest,ff4a7u6,t1_ff48t6r,1579558923.0,"….Yes I understand that but your getting angry at them for not losing out on money for THEIR family because they CANT afford to stay home? Its that time of year, a vicicious cycle, the germs are everywhere you go, if YOU Get sick will YOU stay home and lose out on money for the sake of others? Will YOU lose your sick time for the sake of not getting others sick? Like come on."

They are a CRAP company that does NOT care about their employers/or even patients at all. So unfortunately, that employee may have gotten fired if they didn't show up, you never know.

And that's kind of rude statement for you to make that they ""used their sick time from hangovers"". I know a lot of moms who have used their sick time from their kids being sick, not ""partying it up"" as your accusing with no knowledge of their background. I understand the frustration, but im SURE they wouldn't be there if they COULD stay home"
relationships,feo67vf,t3_eq2r0c,1579295673.0,"I read your edit and honestly I don't believe the marriage is salvageable or that he even cares about you whatsoever. What I would do is slowly cut the ties. Slowly put money away where he wont notice, make a plan, you don't need to pack and run this very second when you CANT (although that would be ideal). Make a plan, contact family out of state and let them know, be discreet and once all your things are lined up to leave, LEAVE. Let him be his pig self, he wont be focused on you and itll be easier to get away"

I'm proud of you and glad that you are at a weight you are happy with! Its an amazing feeling

On his note, you can't change/control what he prefers and do NOT change your happiness/health for his preference, I would suggest if you are not feeling happy/satisfied in the relationship then yes I would suggest breaking up. If he truly prefers you skinnier theres nothing either of you can do really."

To play games? I wouldn't doubt it but he knows the doors those games open with child support"
relationships,fekvkl2,t1_fekv11d,1579208494.0,"Their ""grandfather"" and essentially everyone else in the family is as crappy as him.

Mainly because my oldest daughter asks to see him all the time, and then I have him finding/making ways to contact me when theres been times I've blocked him (I have six facebooks blocked on my facebook currently that he made to contact me). Hes also made texting app numbers to text me at when his number has been blocked"

relationships,feh3ytm,t3_ep2ow9,1579108655.0,"Okay so I just posted a similar story on my profile if you wanted to see what others responses were.

My BF and I just broke up after a year and a half due to him pressuring me about having sex/doing sexual things and not respecting me/listening to why I didn't want to, I was his first LTR too. 

Sex every day is NOT a necessity and if he ""truly"" feels ""unloved"" because you don't want to have sex every single day, theres an underlining issue. I feel like that's more of a guilting measure than true. 

I hope you find a good solution that works for you, because I ended up deciding to end things because it was stressing me out and I was unhappy, not even wanting to have sex because it wasn't exciting/fun anymore being pressured too (on top of that im pregnant so im nauseous more than half the time)"

But Ive noticed any time I'm not in the mood (which honestly isn't that often, I had a birth control that effected my sex drive that I stopped and theres been times ive been very tired or sick), he throws a fit when he gets told no and tries to guilt trip me and I HATE IT.
