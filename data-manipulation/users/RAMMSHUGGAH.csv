Studies have shown that forcing yourself to go to sleep will keep you awake longer, and ignoring thoughts will make them pop up more. 

In short, it's called Ironic Thought Process, which is when your thoughts/feelings/emotions become stronger the more you ignore them, and they become weaker when you acknowledge them.

Lust is sexual, physically fixated, and geared towards only wanting to mate. Your mind gets clouded with fantasies of fucking them, and doesn't factor in anything else about them.

Love is intimate, cooperative, and euphoric. Your mind gets clouded with fantasies of kissing them, holding them, imaging their smile, sleeping next to them, etc. It's like they've unlocked a part of you that you didn't know.

With that being said, lust can turn into love, but not always, usually both sides lose interest after they fuck; love can turn into lust, too, but that just means you're crazy about each other, just gotta make sure the lust is manageable."

This would be fine if the girl didn't already reject the man, but his persistence to change her answer puts her in a position where the girl feels trapped and uncomfortable, forcing her to be as direct as possible to get away.
