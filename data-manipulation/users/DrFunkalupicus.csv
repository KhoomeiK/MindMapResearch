Basically you want to keep doing this until you get each corner as close to 0 as possible. What this does is tram the bed to the frame. I have a BL Touch and I had to do this one time after I had moved my printer because I had somehow knocked everything out of whack. I haven't had to mess with the bed at all since then, and that was a few months ago.

Just make sure to do it with the bed heated and to check your z offset once you're done."

I followed a mix of set up guides to get everything set up and running, but to be honest it wasn't too tricky and I have not had any issues since setting it up. Are you running OctoPrint by chance?"

PrintedMinis,fdmzljf,t3_em6fox,1578572549.0,That looks great! Good job.
ender3,fd9wro4,t3_ekeech,1578238959.0,That looks great! What size nozzle did you use?
ender3,fd5v79a,t3_ek44wr,1578181904.0,"How tight do you have the bolts? These are bolts that need to be kind of loose in my experience. If you have the bolts too tight, there isn't enough play between the wheel and the extruder gear. That causes the pathway to be too restricted and the filament starts getting crushed and ground. Are you seeing a lot of ground up filament on the cold end?

By bolts I mean the bolt holding the silver wheel and the arm"
ender3,fd5szwq,t3_ek44wr,1578181162.0,I'd start with checking your belts and making sure they are tight. Then make sure the bed is level. How exactly did you upgrade the extruder?
