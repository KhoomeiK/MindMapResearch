SuicideWatch,feixqdw,t3_epec61,1579150130.0,"I‚Äôm like that... I think. I only go to a few social gatherings a year though and I don‚Äôt have any close friends. I get the being out someplace peaceful though. I like to walk up to this cool spot and watch the light change on the city scape.  Anyway, you‚Äôre not alone. Hang in there friend ü§ç"
SuicideWatch,feg6s0n,t1_feg6km7,1579079651.0,"It‚Äôs not worth loosing sleep over but, it‚Äôs very nice of you to offer, thank you. ü§ç"
SuicideWatch,feg68vj,t1_feg5vms,1579078899.0,"Well, looks like it‚Äôs gonna be another sleepless night but unfortunately I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs fatal. I‚Äôm not okay but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gonna extinguish this trash fire of a life just this second. Thank you for asking, it helps a bit."
SuicideWatch,feg5bxl,t1_feg53cm,1579077634.0,I appreciate the kind words.
SuicideWatch,feg4uyl,t3_eozo2e,1579077002.0,I have scars from 10+ years ago that I really wish I didn‚Äôt have. It‚Äôs a drag having to be reminded of things every time I see them. Please don‚Äôt do that to yourself. You do not deserve it ü§ç

SuicideWatch,fdpwrei,t3_emnwqe,1578643741.0,Please don‚Äôt give up! If you keep going I promise things will at least get different if not better.
SuicideWatch,fdpvxv6,t1_fdpvldv,1578642730.0,"That‚Äôs totally understandable. Do you think you could hold off a day then, and talk to her after her birthday?  I bet she could totally point you in a new direction."
2meirl4meirl,fdpvn0n,t3_eml0vp,1578642363.0,"No, no... he‚Äôs got a point."
SuicideWatch,fdpvh0n,t1_fdpv9pq,1578642161.0,I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling so low right now. You seem to care about your teacher. Do you think that you could ask them if  they might be able to maybe find another option that you might not be seeing right now?
SuicideWatch,fdpv4kh,t1_fdpuomn,1578641747.0,"I feel ya on the lonely sleepless nights, I‚Äôve had too many, but I‚Äôve had good nights also. Continuing with school seems like a solid plan, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll make some solid friends in college ( relationships too I bet!)."
SuicideWatch,fdpusz3,t3_emnkun,1578641363.0,"Yikes, that‚Äôs a rough way to go. Can I ask why you‚Äôre feeling so down ‚Äòn out?"
SuicideWatch,fdpuhny,t3_emnj6l,1578640991.0,High school isn‚Äôt a super accurate picture of how life is gonna be. I can honestly say that I‚Äôve never once had the slightest desire to relive those days. Things change (: Do you have any plans for after high school?
SuicideWatch,fdptvpl,t3_emndw6,1578640283.0,Don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself!! You deserve love and you never know who you might meet tomorrow. Only one way to find out right?
SuicideWatch,fdpsihh,t3_emn7ke,1578638777.0,Hey there! What‚Äôs got you down friend?
SuicideWatch,fdpr5oa,t1_fdpqos9,1578637358.0,We don‚Äôt need to be like our parents and forever is a long time.  I‚Äôm from so cal and I can confirm that there are plenty of beautiful women in LA man. I totally get the fear. My panic attacks are having panic attacks these days but I keep telling myself that someone is gonna click with me someday if I keep moving along. A little change might not be the worst thing.
SuicideWatch,fdpqgsu,t1_fdpq5lh,1578636637.0,"That‚Äôs pretty much been my experience too, minus the friendship I guess.  
I‚Äôm not gonna tell you there‚Äôs someone for everyone cause I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs quite true but there is a lot of people in this world so I think our chances are better than we might think of finding love."
SuicideWatch,fdpq3ya,t3_emmr3n,1578636269.0,"Preach brother, I can totally relate to wanting a s/o to share life because, well, I‚Äôm in the same boat. Have you tried any dating apps or anything like that?"
SuicideWatch,fdppox4,t1_fdppjse,1578635847.0,You are very welcome!
SuicideWatch,fdppn9m,t3_emmpk7,1578635802.0,"Well, I guess it‚Äôs good that I seemingly always choose the wrong option lol
You wanna talk about what‚Äôs weighing on you?"
SuicideWatch,fdppc89,t1_fdpoz4m,1578635496.0,It‚Äôs gross business to be sure. I hope you can hang on a bit longer. There‚Äôs great people on this sub that understand the struggle if you ever want to talk.
SuicideWatch,fdpovwd,t3_emmlaa,1578635045.0,"Hey friend, that sounds painful and messy. Please don‚Äôt do that. You want to talk about what‚Äôs got you down?"
SuicideWatch,fdplj2n,t3_emm2mz,1578631989.0,I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and talk to the manager and authorize a few more years for you so hang around a while would ya?
SuicideWatch,fdpl00d,t3_emlswb,1578631542.0,"The name checks out. 
Boozing is probably gonna make things worse. Even if you feel like it can‚Äôt get any worse, alcohol will figure out a way to make it worse. That being said, I totally get it. Try and be kind to yourself if you can. Hang in there!!!"
SuicideWatch,fdpjjjh,t1_fdpj097,1578630350.0,You‚Äôre definitely not alone in the way you‚Äôre feeling. I‚Äôm not the most together person but I‚Äôm a pretty good listener if you ever want to talk to someone.  (:
SuicideWatch,fdpir1s,t3_emlfx8,1578629725.0,"I feel this. I‚Äôm a 29 year old male, but I like to dress nice when I can too and people are always confused why even when I tell them it makes me feel a little better. I might not be able to get that message across super effectively though, because my social skills are below average, unlike my anxiety. I go for days without eating and add that to insomnia and some days I can‚Äôt figure up from down let alone my emotions. 
Guess I don‚Äôt have any advice or whatever, I just wanted to tell you you‚Äôre not the only one that feels these things and I hope you hang on a bit longer. You seem like a quality person and you definitely deserve love! ü§ç"
SuicideWatch,fdpgc4d,t3_eml9ht,1578627897.0,"Quality post, thank you üçÄ"
SuicideWatch,fdpf81n,t1_fdp8srj,1578627082.0,I know that feeling so fucking well. It hollows a person out. Hang in there friend.
SuicideWatch,fdpez5v,t3_emk7dd,1578626904.0,"I‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôm handsome and I‚Äôm still a lonely, pathetic, loser pushing 30. The few relationships I‚Äôve had nearly killed me every time. I did the drugs route, seemed to help for a while but in the end it makes everything so much worse."
SuicideWatch,fdpe2s1,t3_emher3,1578626270.0,"It‚Äôs a conundrum, to be sure. Personally, I find that 99% of the time I‚Äôm only living for my family‚Äôs sake and, you know what? Most the time it at least gives me an excuse. I‚Äôm not a coward because I can‚Äôt kill my self, I‚Äôm brave because I don‚Äôt for their sake (not saying it‚Äôs the truth, just a useful excuse for my seemingly useless existence) . 
Anyway, sounds like you care about your family and sometimes that‚Äôs my only reason to keep getting up."
SuicideWatch,fdpd9yu,t3_emkge3,1578625710.0,I‚Äôm rooting for ya!!!
SuicideWatch,fdpd0va,t3_emkhhl,1578625535.0,"Any method comes with a plethora of potential permanent damage to the body and/or mind if survived. It‚Äôs often cited as one of the primary fears that keep people from committing suicide and rightfully so. Complications arising from a unsuccessful attempt can be truly horrific and serve to make a bad situation much, much, worse.  Please don‚Äôt do it."

SuicideWatch,fdmmhm7,t1_fdmm0l3,1578555602.0,I think it would be worth it. It sounds kinda tacky but emotions a complex and can be super confusing.  No shame in getting a little help to try and understand them.
SuicideWatch,fdmlul9,t1_fdmlgnh,1578554864.0,"Time doesn‚Äôt heal everything. Talking to a therapist seems to help a lot of people. I had to lean on my sister pretty hard recently to stay this side of sane.  My guess is though, you‚Äôre probably not loosing your mind."
SuicideWatch,fdmksrh,t3_em65i1,1578553636.0,You should definitely post that on Facebook.
SuicideWatch,fdmkmkq,t3_em5y6i,1578553441.0,"Some bridges are really difficult to burn. People will still miss you.  I‚Äôm 29 and that‚Äôs probably the reason I‚Äôm still going.  You know, I‚Äôm not sure though actually, the reason might be to just see how far this thing can really go.  You know, like watching a train crash, I just can‚Äôt look away!"
SuicideWatch,fdmjhuj,t3_em5rfq,1578552176.0,Don‚Äôt do it!!

It was my first relapse experience because, well this is the first time I‚Äôve ever seriously tried to quit. The hangover and damage I did to myself was pretty bad, sure, but I‚Äôm an alcoholic, I‚Äôm used to that abuse. What I didn‚Äôt expect was the huge emotional fallout. I had to lean hard on someone for a couple days. I cried through a couple meetings. It was rough, yeah, but shit happens. The rest of our lifetimes are full of sober days to count if that‚Äôs what we want. I‚Äôm rooting for ya. You got this!!!! Hell, WE GOT THIS!!!
