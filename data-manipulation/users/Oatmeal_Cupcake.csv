I like this video because she puts treats in a snuffle mat but then calls her pup back from sniffing. Give it a watch!"
VetTech,ffemv1z,t3_et2msw,1579854996.0,That’s awesome! Look at that happy face!!!
PublicFreakout,ffemmyp,t3_et2fbi,1579854674.0,And I thought my reactive dog had issues.
AskReddit,fdk02gg,t3_elju40,1578492665.0,"I read a post a while ago about a mom that cancelled her baby shower because of how the her family was reacting to the name she chose for her son. 

Squire Sebastian Senator and that’s his FIRST name. She said that “He will not be allowed to have a nickname, he is to be called by his full and complete first name,” and that “My baby’s name WILL be a revolution.”  

The woman concludes her lengthy Facebook rant calling her family “fake” and claiming her name choice will make her son “extraordinary.”"
reactivedogs,fda79m9,t1_fd8t32t,1578242585.0,"Thank you for sharing your story. You know, it’s really interesting that you mention an effect of confidence lasting for a couple days. I remember hearing the same thing with another dog that did some herding. 

This definitely makes me want to take some private agility classes in the future and see how it works out for us. Right now we’ve got a sniff class starting this week. I‘ve heard that it’s a great confidence builder as well so we’ll see!"
reactivedogs,fd7z3af,t1_fd6q29a,1578212024.0,I’d love to get my reactive girl into agility. How did you see your girl change? I’d love to hear more about your story.
reactivedogs,fcwpzum,t3_ej5pz8,1578033140.0,"I found that once I accepted my dogs reactivity things got better. I’ve been taking things at her pace and I just manage situations and don’t put her in a position where she’s going to fail. I’ve accepted that she’s not going to be a “normal” dog and that’s ok because being around other dogs is overrated and dangerous. I’m also not perfect and have my own fears so I can really expect her to be perfect either. 

I’d recommend not letting your dog have access to things that she guards. Like the socks. Have those on lock down. Maybe with time and practice you can work up to socks but probably not a good starting point if she’s not willing to take high value treats. 

I think learning where she will fail will be key to managing her life to help her succeed.

Oh!! There’s also this neat idea of putting sod in a kiddy pool. People that get caught in natural disasters will use this as an emergency potty."
Flipping,fcmi94l,t3_ehwvzd,1577776332.0,Their fault. I’ve personally forked over the extra costs if it means getting the package safely to the buyer. The seller needs to learn and that’s either going to be through you or another seller that isn’t that kind.
dogs,fcl89ri,t1_fcky5au,1577741958.0,"Yes, this is true. There were days where her reactivity would get to me. I made sure that I had support online through Reddit, FB, Instagram and my boyfriend. There are some pretty shit days where I would doubt everything about being the right owner for her. Still, I knew that it’s one step forward and two steps back. We had good days and bad days. Regardless of how bad I felt I would just take a break from training, dust myself off and keep on going. But yes, it is hard at times."
dogs,fcl73bg,t1_fckjleb,1577741225.0,"Really? My mental health got SO much better. I love my reactive girl. Maybe it’s just a mix of right mental instability on both our parts? That’s another thing too, I can’t demand her to be perfect without faults if I know I have faults too."
dogs,fcl6wm8,t3_eho07v,1577741109.0,"I got a dog because I wanted a dog. Before I got her I was REALLY depressed. I knew I was depressed back then back looking back I can really see the extent of it. 

Before I got her, I thought dogs were a certain way and all you do is train them to go potty, sit, down, manners, cute tricks, etc. My dog actually ended up being fear based dog reactive. By the time I realized this, she had already been with me for a couple months so I couldn’t just return her. There were times I could’ve and I almost did but my boyfriend encouraged me to keep going. I went to multiple dog trainers, immersed myself in dog videos, dog podcasts and read books, my life revolved around work, Netflix, dog training and dog education. Eventually things started to click into place with the help of one trainer. She’s  gotten better but not over her fears. We’ve still got a long way to go. 

The thing with her is, she does need me a lot for basic needs, but, when we encounter a dog, nothing else matters. I flip into training mode, push my feelings aside and help her through the situation so she doesn’t have a meltdown. On the flip side, she’s so attached to the hip to me. I’m never really alone. The times that I am sad and start crying, she will run to me and nuzzle her face into mine. She will physically find ways to comfort me. She makes me laugh on a regular bases and is always up for playing. I think of her all the time at work and can’t wait to get home to her. I’m excited to have days off so we can snuggle on the couch. Even though she is reactive, we still have relaxing walks that I enjoy a lot. 

I can’t say that this will be the case for you if you get a dog. It really depends a lot on the dogs personally and how involved you want to get into your dogs training so you can immerse yourself into it. I really wish that my dog training days were geared towards dog agility and maybe someday we could. There’s also competition obedience, fly ball, dock diving, Treiball, Canicross, scent classes, etc. I think that if you dedicate yourself to your dog and train and find a hobby together than yes, it could help you. See if you could spend sometime at some dog sports, a dog park or with people that have dogs. See how it makes you feel. 

However, be aware of the curveball that life could throw you. I never expected my dog to be reactive towards other dogs and it wasn’t what I wanted to do with her. She wasn’t the dog I thought I wanted but she is DEFINITELY the type of dog I needed. So because I embraced this “flaw” I was able to get myself out of my depression. Having my dog be around other dogs is overrated anyways. I hear so many stories of dog attacks or sicknesses going around. No thanks. 

Lastly, I am a positive dog owner/trainer. I would never treat her with any less respect and kindness than I would treat another human being with. I want her friendship and her trust. I never wanted a boss/servant relationship. I wanted a partnership that was based on trust. I could never do that with punitive methods.

Edit: if you’re really worried about the personality of the dog you’re going to get then I would highly recommend a breeder. However, there is a podcast by Elite Per Podcast called Meet the Breed - German Shepards by Susanne Shelton Part 2. There are so EXCELLENT questions to be asking a breeder regarding not only their health but also their temperament. She’s got other videos of meet the breed that suggest asking similar questions regarding personality traits as well that I never even dreamed of asking a breeder."

I got walked in on with my boyfriend by his mom. The ride to work with his mom the next morning was pretty awkward. We never really talked about it and that helped. I still die of embarrassment when I think of that moment."
