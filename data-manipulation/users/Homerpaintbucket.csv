Tony had people around him to advise him, so he didn't blow all his money and actually invested it.  Vert died at the end of the 80's and a lot of skaters basically faded into obscurity in the early 90's when street was king. Tony Hawk was able to ride out that period because he had set himself up to come out of skateboarding with money. He treated it like something he could use to get a good start on life and have a good career when skateboarding ended.  He just got really lucky that it never really ended and just took a short break, because once the X games came out and they started putting vert on TV again in the late 90's he became relevant again."

You need to be careful when you are trying to adopt things from other cultures.

Now, to some extent I agree that some cries of cultural appropriation go too far.  If you're dressed as another culture for halloween, that's bad taste.  if you're wearing something that's not ritualistically significant from another culture because you think it looks cool, or even better, you got it when you traveled there I see nothing wrong with that.

It's pretty fucking blatant too, especially on the weekends.  They want pic only submissions, so you never get the full story and they constantly repost the same inflammatory out of context posts to piss off white boys.  It's really sad."

AskReddit,fewkxrl,t1_fevdo7k,1579413081.0,"Dude, this happened to my buddy, but not in his mini-fridge.  About 20 years ago his school had a dorm shortage, so for the first couple of months he was there they gave him the student lounge on his floor, which was cool because it was big, but they cheaped out on the locks I guess and they didn't work well.  One night he woke up with some kid in his room pissing on the floor.  He asked the kid what he was doing and apparently the kid put one finger to his own mouth and ""ssshhhhhed"" him."
