PvZHeroes,ff6qfyj,t3_eryn50,1579632732.0,"The Zombot.

It is now unfair since it left a 9/9 zombie on the ground lane very unexpectedly with nothing to block it. The reason it's played on the zombies play phase is so your opponent can get back a bit to the game after their defenses ravaged. That's why Teleport Zombot is a con-troll deck.

The reason only Immorticia & Brain Freeze can pull out the combo is because it will be too OP for it to be played on zombie tricks phase. 

Immorticia sometimes isn't able to topdeck both Teleport/Teleportation Zombie & Zombot & it leaves her in a problematic state if she can't survive until turn 10. 

Brain Freeze will need Graveyard (an environment, easy to be overriden), or Cursed Gargolith. Gargolith sometimes can't be kept alive until turn 9 (primary target).
