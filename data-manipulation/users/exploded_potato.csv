AmItheAsshole,fffis1x,t1_ffeups2,1579884859.0,"if it's a wireless mic, it'll be a really low voltage(less than one volt).  wireless mics are dynamic, meaning they work like a speaker in reverse; the only voltage is the voltage generated by the sound.  

wired mics can be condenser mics, which need 48v dc power to run.  i wouldn't advise putting 48v near your mouth."
