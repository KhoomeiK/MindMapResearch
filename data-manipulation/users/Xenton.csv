leagueoflegends,fgkv0my,t1_fgkd5k0,1580874231.0,"The Q is a fifth of her mana and scales like shit. If she is out-sustaining you because of the Q alone, you're playing poorly against her."
leagueoflegends,fgkuwrd,t3_eyxolh,1580874159.0,"Senna lacks mobility, reliable CC and her Q's damage and heal scale abysmally into the late game.

She's strong as an AD because of her mid-game power, which is in no small part due to reaching specific milestones with her passive at specific points in the game.

Being 3-4 souls down at 10 minutes and having 36 souls instead of 40 is a big deal - it's a big range and damage reduction, she loses crit and viability significantly and with the reduction in her capacity to trade safely, her later soul gain is further reduced.

People are vastly underestimating the compounding significance of a few less souls. Those 20/40/60/etc breakpoints are huge for senna and every minute they're delayed makes her exponentially worse throughout the game as it slows down the next milestone in the chain even further.

The reason they buffed the support soul gain is because at the rankings in which AD Senna is good, Support Senna is mediocre (Or straight up crap). They're tweaking her to direct her usage.

This complaint sounds like somebody who's frustrated to play against Senna but hasn't actually played her themselves, or perhaps toyed around as a support but hasn't taken her as a carry.

leagueoflegends,fgkuc4v,t3_eynxmq,1580873790.0,"This is one of those weird cases where a good point is overshadowed by a bunch of objectively false crap.

TF, Xin, etc are fine and were fairly quickly balanced, their problems were in tuning not in design.

In contrast, Aphelios is a complete mess: Aesthetically and functionally he is extremely difficult to predict for opponents and allies.

He is not intuitive, it's hard enough keeping track of his weapons let alone his ammo count let alone his choice of combo let alone the specific interactions of his weapons with one another let alone doing all of that while managing everything else in the game.

He's fundamentally hard to balance because, while not ""Complicated"", he's unintuitive and gimmicky. Characters like Akali have similar issues because of the sheer volume of crap they can do in a fight.

The more tools you give somebody, the harder they are to balance. Combine that with fundamentally binary gameplay (like seen with akali and aphelios) and you wind up with an almost impossible to balance mess of a character.

If he's able to do what he needs to, he's too good at it. If he can't, he's useless. He might momentarily be perfectly balance, but one subtle meta shift and he'll slide back one way or the other immediately."

But the problem is worse than that.

It's not that it's too hard to figure out all his abilities, it's that even when you know them all, it's all but impossible to predict what he's about to do.

Unless you're team is constantly communicating what weapons he has, and you've got sight of him 100% of the time, there's no way to keep track of his ammo or current weapons.

And even if you COULD, he's still got a huge degree of flexibility as to what he does even between his current two weapons.

Will he come at you with CC? Burst? Will he snare you at long range for his team or will he duel you with massive lifesteal? What's that - He's got fire and gravity? Cool... so will he go for the cleaving burst or CC you? Will he try for the ult with the gravity or the fire?

It's just dumb.

He's objectively a horrible character.

Unintuitive, overdesigned and yet under built; he feels clunky as hell to play and his visual effects are just dorky and awful.

For what it's worth, most of these units are relatively self sufficient for ki and their combined strengths mean that 18 ki supers aren't that important, you also wouldn't need to worry about gobros ki, given you'd only need to run a team like this in the longer events.

Beyond that, there's only a handful of decent kamehameha supports that would fit the rest of the team and it'd be difficult to be judicious insofar as who you'd remove, and they'd wind up being a weak link in SBR and LGE when they tend to be far weaker, defensively, than the other members of this team.

The reason this team is good isn't optimal ki and damage, it's that it has very high consistent damage while also being extremely defensively powerful."

As for kill rate: WHO is saying that current values are exaggerated due to poor healthcare and high rates of chronic lung disease in Wuhan at the onset of the diseases identification and that we're seeing a declining mortality rate now, more in line with other severe coronaviruses (ie: a little worse than the common cold, but not as bad as a seasonal flu)"
