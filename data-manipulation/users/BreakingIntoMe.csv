If you take away your soft bed, the walls around you, the roof over your head, the city that surrounds you, you’re left with an environment of suffering where you would not be able to survive alone, you will either freeze to death or die of heat exhaustion or of starvation. Suffering is the default state of life."
fiaustralia,fdqjce6,t1_fdq2swo,1578668084.0,"Yeah this is my major hesitation with the philosophy behind FIRE. A lot of people are on the journey to achieving by sacrificing their quality of life now for a promised better quality of life in their middle and late ages. But it’s those mid and late stages of life where your body will start to wear and it’s when your likelihood of developing a serious condition or being diagnosed with a disease increase substantially. It’s a dilemma for me, as I want to gain control of my time but don’t want to sacrifice my best years of life in doing so. It’s especially poignant to me as I’ve watched my mother slowly deteriorate with a severe illness this last year. Is it really worth the delayed gratification or are you better off living in the moment and improving your current quality of life?"

getdisciplined,fdoqx61,t3_em4up8,1578610892.0,"This is what worked for me - unsubscribe from any channel you don’t think you can learn from and apply to your life. And not in the sense that “This guy teaches DOTA and I play DOTA”.

So any educational channels I stayed subscribed to, I’m interested in tech so I stayed subscribed to one tech channel, there’s another tech channel but I’m interested in learning how he built his business so I stayed subscribed. I have a photography hobby so I’m subscribed to a few photography channels.

Basically, can I apply any of the info in this persons videos in a meaningful way to my life? If so I’m staying subscribed, otherwise it’s a waste of my precious time and it’s only holding me back in life."
science,fdopmay,t1_fdoff30,1578610039.0,"I don’t mean to confuse you, but he said you need to become a full stack developer - that’s terrible advice to someone just starting out, that’s like starting out with a double degree. Just learn the building blocks as the other commenter said, HTML and CSS. Then learn some basic JavaScript. 

You should then decide whether you want to be a front end developer (using the 3 languages just described), back end developer (learn a back end language and a database query language), or a full stack developer (do both)."
AusFinance,fdjguq5,t1_fdj9bs6,1578470225.0,"For what it’s worth I was below minimum wage in 2009, working as a first year apprentice. I hated that job and quit after a year or so because I sucked at it. Then I worked for TNT in a warehouse doing dock hand shift work, it was mundane but it paid $28 an hour. I did that for about 2 years then I decided to do a TAFE course in software development because my days were free anyway and I had a natural interest in computers.

I got a diploma after 2 years of that, and was luckily hired on graduation day. Fast forward 5 years now and I make $110k as a software dev. It was hard work but I’m not particularly bright and was able to do it. You can absolutely make that kind of money, just try different things until you find something you like, when you find that thing you dedicate all of your energy into building your skills around it. Sometimes you need to work jobs you hate to really understand what you *don’t* want to do with your time."

apple,fd5wsjs,t1_fd5fgfb,1578182483.0,"Australian here, I salt sadly agree with you. The people in rural parts of Australia were the ones who were a majority voting in a conservative government who downplays climate change and pushes for the coal industry. 
Meanwhile the opposition party had a very clear plan on how they plan to tackle climate change and ironically a detailed plan to buff the fire fighting service with more funding and things like ex-military helicopters etc. I hope the devastation these are witnessing is enough to persuade them to change their fucking vote next election. 

People blame Rupert Murdoch, but at a certain point we need to take personal responsibility for our actions."

fiaustralia,fcvwifx,t1_fcvkee3,1578011689.0,"Hey do whatever makes you happy, but I’m saying that it’s not a sustainable business model as its extremely volatile and completely at the behest of marketing platform changes, it only takes a small adjustment on the platform for you to lose all business. Business viability aside, I think it’s a soulless industry where you’re just trying to make money for the sake of making money and not because of any desire or passion for something."
fiaustralia,fcvgadn,t1_fcv3qn0,1578001478.0,Dropshipping is a luck based get rich quick scheme and I think the only people actually making reliable money from it are the ones “educating“ other people on how to do it through ebooks and online tutorials. I would personally steer clear as that is a highly volatile area of work and not something you’ll be able to do for the next 5+ years.
