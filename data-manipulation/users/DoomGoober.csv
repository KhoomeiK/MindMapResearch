I push down with my foot. Bolt doesn't move. I stand and bounce on it. Bolt doesn't move. Looking for a win, I try a different bolt. Bolt doesn't move. 

Someone else comes up and says, ""Need help?"" She looks at me like, ""you ok with him helping?"" I know nothing about cars (I had too google the name of the wrench), so putting whatever little pride I have aside, I say, ""Yes please!"" First, he reaches into the car and pulls the e brake (oops) then looks at the jack and raises it up more so the tire isnt touching the ground at all (oops again.) He applies a violent kick, then stand on the lug wrench and one bolt spins free. He does the same for the next bolt.

At this point I am just standing there so I give a ""good luck!"" to both of them. She thanks me and I go inside to buy groceries.

I come back out like 30 minutes later and the spare is still on the ground, the flat tire on the car, attached by one stubborn bolt that refuses to let go.

bodyweightfitness,ff6ub9l,t3_eryx5t,1579635035.0,"Disclaimer: I am terrible at hand-balancing. That said, I've spent a lot of time on bars and on the floor and noticed some interesting things:

1) Just kicking up to handstand on bars sucks. I used to do a kind of half falling/half gymnastics kick up, which doesn't work on the bars simply because my hands would miss the bars. A more controlled press up or donkey kick style would work better but both of those styles require a lot more strength and tend to be less consistent for me.

2) Bailing from bars feels a little scary. I used to do a pirouette bail where I would move one hand 90 degrees so I would fall with control... but that sucks on bars since you need to go from bar to floor which is tricky. If I had a more twisty bail I think it would have been less of problem but I actually needed to move one hand the way I learn to bail.

3) That said, I do feel like the balance on bars was easier for me: on bars, it's a wrist deviation from neutral. On floor it's wrist flexion/extension from an extreme extended position. Also, I found I could both push my palm down on the bar and pull with my fingers some.

Do you spend much time on p-bars for dips or support holds or other things like planche or even crow pose? The hand balancing from all of these is actually quite similar to handstand balancing on p-bars. Practicing some of these might carry over..."

bodyweightfitness,ff3aau2,t1_ff2twcu,1579537301.0,"Not a stupid question. But yes parallettes are easier. If you think about how you balance forward and back with hand on flat ground versus hand on parallete you will see on parallette you are moving your wrist with deviation with a good ROM while on flat ground you can only flex or extend your wrist and your extension is already near the end of ROM.

Also with parallettes you can grip the bottom of the bar as well as the top which gives you two points of contact (ie you can pull or push to help you balance while on the ground you can only push.)"
bodyweightfitness,ff39npv,t1_ff2zewt,1579536945.0,"You have to realize chest to bar pretty much requires explosive pull ups. People claim they can do slow and controlled chest to bar but I have only ever seen like a handful of people do it ever and most of them were in false grip and had been training slow muscle ups which are a slightly different exercise.

Chest to bar banded will not work because the band provides the least assistance at top ROM.

You have to treat chest to bar like any explosive movement. Do 1 or 2 then take a rest. Focus on accelerating as much as possible early in the movement and keep accelerating through the strong middle. When you start to get to the weaker top part make sure you aren't slowing yourself.

bodyweightfitness,fez2pbl,t1_feywhis,1579453307.0,"Sweet rig. Word of caution: I see many people progress to the stage you are at (slightly piked front lever with short hold) who then get stuck at that stage.

I think they feel so close to front lever that they keep doing piked short hold FL and never progress.

There are two problems at this stage, I think. The slight pike is like a hollow hold and puts your lower body and core into a stronger position (as well as curving your upper spine a little.) I think at this point people should regress to advanced tuck holding upper spine and hips all I line. Then you can half lay or straddle or one legged all keeping straight line (no pike.)

At this stage volume also becomes a problem. The desire to stay close to full FL keeps this bad form and each rep is too short and is not developing the right strength. Regress again for longer holds and mix in activities with reps like FL pulls with straight body line to get more volume (you can use momentum at first with FL pulls and try to hold FL position then slow them as you get stronger.)

Not to take away from what you achieved already... just be cautious now how you proceed or your progress will be unnecessarily slow."

bodyweightfitness,fept18t,t1_fepohwt,1579330277.0,"I used to think the same way you do: the body stores energy different ways and that storage has different masses... and you can consume different types of foods which are related to how they are stored, right?

I kept arguing and researching and finally concluded from careful reading... what you eat doesn't matter for gaining or losing weight all that matters is how much potential energy you eat and how much energy you burn. That's it. Protein, Fat, Carbs, Alcohol will be stored as mass on your body if you don't burn it (the mass is potential energy stored in chemical bonds, and after the chemicals release energy the waste mass leaves your body as water and carbon dioxide.) The body evolved to handle starvation so it's super efficient at storing energy as mass and doesn't waste any even if it doesn't need it right now. It just stores it.

So that's it. You can eat twinkies all day and lose weight (https://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/11/08/twinkie.diet.professor/index.html) as long as the energy from the twinkies you eat is less than the energy you burn."
