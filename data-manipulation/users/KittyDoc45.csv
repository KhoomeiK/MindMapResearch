bipolar,fb7vlw8,t3_ebxfuw,1576600385.0,Sounds like me when I was undiagnosed lol. But I was scared to be diagnosed too because I thought the meds would cause me to not be me. Tell her it'll make her again. Being diagnosed is the best thing ever. I'm actually myself again and I feel stable. I still have a low libido but I take horny goat weed to help with that.
