I've have a few critters lay eggs or breed on me, then immediately die. Breeding isn't always a good sign."

They did all the work. I just had to fill out some forms. But I got the drug for free while they tried to get my insurance to cover it. I guess they only give it to you for free on the premise that you have insurance that may foot the bill?

They are loved, respected, but also feared (a bit of an unofficial mascot of the university). When it's breeding time (for the geese, not the students), everyone maps out the confirmed goose nests using an app called Goose Watch so you can steer clear of the hyper-aggressive ones. There's still a decent chance you will probably get attacked by a wandering goose or stalled on the road by a goose parade, but it's helpful. The comments feature is also very entertaining."

Aquariums,fdljf34,t1_fdlipk2,1578525345.0,Maybe this conversation would be more productive if you didn't answer questions meant for other people (my question in my first comment was for OP who appeared to be a beginner hobbyist and you decided it was a moment to lecture on the more advanced and conservative methods of tank cycling)
Aquariums,fdlf6z9,t1_fdlalx8,1578522715.0,"In my experience, you usually dose some amount of ammonia, then track ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate over multiple days and watch them peak and fall to 0. Many people post photos of their API test kit results of ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate doing this exact thing. I thought you were suggesting doing this over the course of 24 hours, which is not how quickly tanks cycle. I guess you are suggesting doing a ""second 24 test"" to confirm that your tank is in fact cycled by repeating this process over 24 hours (but only testing twice in one day) following the initial nitrate drop? So you were telling me in my earlier comment that a tank isn't cycled when nitrates are at zero, but only after you do this ""second 24 hour test""? Are you expecting your stock to increase ammonia to 2 ppm every 24 hours in the time frame between the initial nitrate drop and the time your tank would pass this ""second 24 test""? How much stock are you throwing in your tank initially? I have never had an ammonia issue proceeding to stock my tank conservatively without this 24 hour test. By all means, do it if you want, but don't tell someone their tank isn't cycled without it. I think it's pretty conservative."
Aquariums,fdl5hse,t1_fdk7wgj,1578517387.0,"It's not extreme to monitor your ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate every few hours over the course of 24 hours? Ok. Great way to get people interested in the hobby. I used to work in a fish store and this would go over great with people starting out. Just start saying the words ""ammonia"" and ""nitrate"". Their eyes start to glaze over and they start looking at the Glo fish instead."
Aquariums,fdjw1ip,t1_fdjhpkj,1578489355.0,"My crabs (especially these ones) and my anemones are my favorite tank inhabitants, although I keep an invert-only tank. :) They have so much personality!"
Aquariums,fdjvqyh,t1_fdja4pb,1578489091.0,"I don't understand what you are saying. Are you saying you've got a healthy bacteria population when you can introduce 2 ppm ammonia and it converts to nitrate within 24 hours? Sure, never heard of that one but if you have time to track your nitrogen cycle over the course of a day then do that. Sounds extreme and unlikely. I have a coldwater tank at 11 C and the species of bacteria in my tank fix nitrogen much slower than tropical species so that rule isn't going to apply. 

I guess I'll stop trying to help beginner tank owners with no replies to their question with simple advice on this sub because everyone wants to follow up and correct me and probably confuse OP with their own overly complicated explanation of the nitrogen cycle."
AquariumMemes,fdj8agj,t1_fdimp1g,1578461301.0,"I was just sharing my experience with Triops because they seem to share some similarities. They are called ""tadpole shrimp"" after all. I thought that's what aquarium hobbyists do - ramble on about their tanks to people who may or may not care lol"
Aquariums,fdj6kr5,t1_fdj4nhs,1578459876.0,"High nitrates means you're done cycling if you've been tracking ammonia and nitrite as needed and they are close to or are at zero. If your cycle is done then by all means yes do a large water change to reduce nitrates before you start stocking, but you shouldn't need to clean your gravel.

Edit: sorry, I've been assuming you're doing a fishless cycle. If you have a fish in there that has created some waste on the gravel, then gently vacuum it up when you do your water change to remove nitrates. You won't be destroying your precious new bacteria colony if you disturb the gravel a little in the process of removing ammonia- producing waste."
Aquariums,fdj2sge,t3_elgs96,1578456951.0,"It's diatoms. They feed on phosphates and require silicate to grow. If you can't get them under control with reduced lighting and cleaning/water changes, use a phosphate removing media, which will also remove silicate. They are common in a new tank."
Aquariums,fdj1dq1,t3_eln1v8,1578455949.0,"Bacteria will grow on surfaces like gravel vs float in the water so that makes sense if you are trying to not disturb any growing bacteria populations but more importantly, why are you doing water changes while you are cycling your tank?

AquariumMemes,fdikewo,t1_fdiir7r,1578444876.0,Triops lay their eggs in the sand and they require a drying period to hatch so I have to sift my substrate for eggs and dry them out to breed my Triops. Can't have any complicated layers of substrate and equipment under the sand where the Triops are laying their eggs. Interesting that shrimp breeders have their own unique filter setups.

AquariumMemes,fdi59z2,t1_fdfziah,1578435974.0,">it is still the best hidden filter ever made

Imagine a filter completely hidden underneath your tank in a sump or a canister that you don't have to completely destroy your plants/rocks/etc to clean... :) Just playing devil's advocate about the best ""hidden filter"" lol. Although a sump tank or canister is probably overkill for a nano tank unless you're running a very technical saltwater tank. I'd prefer to just use a sponge for a freshwater nano with low flow and cover it with plants."

migraine,fclvsmb,t3_ehok90,1577757678.0,Thank you for sharing this. Your words really resonate with me as someone else who also suffers from nearly daily chronic migraines after trying many treatments (thankfully I do not also experience aura). I really relate to the idea of accepting your condition and limitations. Your ideas took me a while to accept and normalize in my life. Your post probably just scratches the surface of your behavioral and physical routines and practices to cope with daily migraines. I know I have many. Thanks again. :)
