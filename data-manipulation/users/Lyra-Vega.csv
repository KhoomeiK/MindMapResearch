vaxxhappened,ffjz2lc,t3_etuo8z,1580010906.0,"If ""they"" were creating viruses just to make ""humanity saving"" vaccines to harm us or control us or whatever, then HIV would have had an effective vaccine by now. But I bet their excuse would be something like, ""they lost control over it and that's why they don't have a vaccine."" These people are extra."
lupus,ffjxind,t3_eu038o,1580009675.0,Good luck! I was told a therapeutic dose is 600 but I hope the 100s help!
MelanieMartinez,ffjwyqs,t1_ffalqmo,1580009234.0,"This negative publicity is actually what drove me to Melanie. Haha. I had heard all sorts of awful things and explored Crybaby and fell in love. I could tell that it wasn't at all what people were claiming it was. It's social commentary and it really drives me nuts when people take social commentary and call it ""problematic"". Well YEAH! Society is problematic!"
Acid,ffjwg78,t1_ffj6xwc,1580008822.0,"However, it can still be dangerous for some people. I've heard of people developing (triggering?) schizophrenia from using acid and in at least one case someone died as a result of schizophrenic delusions. Governments need to stop painting things in black and white so that people can be more educated and safer when using any substance."
Fibromyalgia,ffjw3hh,t1_ffisc1s,1580008544.0,Pain is exhausting.
vaxxhappened,ffisonk,t3_eto6te,1579981737.0,This is very refreshing.
Onision,ffi4jq4,t1_ffi0wwv,1579964876.0,"They did that to show the discrepancy between the length of the 6ft marker and the lengths of the other ""foot length"" markers. Stack about 5 of those 6ft markers and it's just a little shorter than Gurg.
Edit: Words need to make sense."
Onision,ffhavxb,t3_etmbjc,1579928281.0,"People have questioned Kais transition so you're not the first. I also don't think Kai is genuinely trans. However, I don't know if Kai did it for immunity to their actions. I think it's something that either Greg pushed or developed due to abuse from Greg. Greg has a history of defeminising people he dates, I wouldn't be surprised if that factored into Kais supposed transition.
Edit: My brain forgets whole words sometimes."
Onision,ffgszwu,t3_etjrwo,1579914290.0,I know this is a photoshop but I feel bad for whoever was using the rest room when this photo was taken.
vaxxhappened,ffgj6zw,t1_fffpcjh,1579907466.0,And if you can't get them for any reason (don't see why that would happen) your primary can test you for your vaccinations.
vaxxhappened,ffgivst,t1_fffdw1v,1579907260.0,Holy crap that's scary. That's making me twice as glad I got it this year (especially since I was diagnosed with lupus.)
vaxxhappened,ffgikto,t3_etfetr,1579907054.0,If I could get vaccinated against the cold I damn well would. I don't know anything about coronavirus but I'd get all sorts of vaccines if they existed.
vaxxhappened,ffgi9ew,t3_ethcxx,1579906844.0,"Seems they got sick of people calling them out for vaccinating their dogs but not their kids. Smh. Those poor animals, they literally don't have a choice."
fatlogic,ffcqm51,t1_ffbrg3s,1579805192.0,The funeral thing happened to me once. I thought they were heading out on a date. It was so awkward.
fatlogic,ffcq9rs,t3_esqqw3,1579804959.0,This implies people don't know the people they're complimenting. I have a friend that's losing weight and I'm happy for her and complimenting her and all of that. You know why? Because I KNOW why she's losing weight. Because I know she's doing it because she wants to. It's not like I'm complimenting her weight loss without any context as to why.
Onision,ff6d7i8,t1_ff63bw5,1579624643.0,"I used to sit on the windowsill with my legs hanging out. I mostly did it because we had the window guards so I knew I wouldn't fall. But when we were old enough to not have them anymore I still did it. I was old enough to know better and I still did it. Kids are unpredictable. You can't trust them not to get into trouble.
Edit: Word correction."
Onision,ff62d3w,t3_erum7z,1579617380.0,"Why. Don't. They. Have. Window. Guards!!! The fact that she ""fell out a window"" should have been an issue that was brought up to Gurg and Kai. It should have been mandated. It should BE mandated."
fatlogic,ff568zt,t1_ff4qysp,1579581412.0,Such as hanging laundry. How dare that skinny person wear small clothing!
fatlogic,ff55y3o,t3_erobuz,1579581163.0,"Oh yes, don't go on a short term diet to lose weight and improve your health while making it safe for you to have surgery, just get surgery first!"
fatlogic,ff55ah6,t1_ff535fq,1579580632.0,It really depends on TDEE and how much of a deficit you can manage daily.
BorderlinePDisorder,ff4gwyp,t3_erf904,1579563333.0,I love this show. There's definitely a lot I could relate to. Especially her making things into signs and the Diagnosis song (it's similar to how I felt after finally getting a diagnosis in my late 20s).
AskReddit,ff22clf,t1_ff1o0cp,1579491913.0,Do I want to know?
AskReddit,ff20xzy,t3_eqzisc,1579490865.0,Don't let a pole pass between you and your companion(s).
AskReddit,ff1znzm,t1_ff1q0m4,1579489941.0,Oh God I hate when people load dishwashers haphazardly.
