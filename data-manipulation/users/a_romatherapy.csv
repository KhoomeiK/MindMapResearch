I also really enjoy Orpheous for breweries."

MealPrepSunday,fcxa76s,t3_ej7o83,1578057098.0,"This is a great start! 

If you are looking to make it healthier, if just take some of the cheese off top - I found sauces already have it and fill my need for that. To supplement, I usually buy some easy fruit (apples, bananas) and eat with peanut butter as a snack."
Shoestring,fclysaf,t3_ehvs4i,1577759792.0,"I've yet to have a bad experience and the bus drivers are generally pretty chill. On slower routes/off times you get to spread out a bit. Getting a table seat ($2ish extra) is a good move if cost isn't as much a concern. 

For luggage, nothing stolen, but I always keep my most valuables in a bag with me. If you're at the beginning of a route, it isn't late, but I think there's an app or you can check the status on the website (idk if it is well updated) for later stops.

As with any bus, I think you had to expect a certain degree of ""shit happens"" - have a flexible mindset. You'll get where you need to go eventually."
bulletjournal,fc7v1hu,t3_egj4ui,1577519376.0,"Would love to see an inside shot of these! 

Beautiful work - I'd also cross-post to r/woodworking, they like the occasional non-table!"
