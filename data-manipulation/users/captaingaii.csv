I'd love to discuss her further abuse and why she thinks staying in her current situation would benefit, and what I could possibly do about this, but I doubt that this is the thread to do so."

unpopularopinion,fewi4sn,t3_eqrm8f,1579410996.0,"I have a partner who suffers for this exact reason. Their mattress is about the thickness of my middle finger and they share a small room with two of their siblings because their dad can only afford to work minimum wage at a liquor store. Admittedly, there are many other issues afoot here, but the point still stands that their father was definitely not in a place to have more than one child. Majority of the time, she goes hungry because her siblings eat the rest of the food in the house (that SHE cooks while their dad is out working all the time) and has to be a carer for the two of them at fifteen. Their dad is partially on benefits too, and they'll more than likely be homeless as when the eldest moves out they'll no longer have enough money for rent. Good times."

AskReddit,fdnxmw0,t3_em2vfz,1578594925.0,"I have seriously laid back patents. My dad never really have a shit what I did and used to spoil me rotten however mum was a *little* more tough.

The school bus left at 7:59 (yes, EXACTLY that time). It was a five minute walk, and I could get ready and have time to mess about on my phone in 20mins, easily. So I needed to be up at about 7:20 on most days (it was actually about 7:30 or even 7:45 if I was feeling dangerous.)

...but my mum wanted me up at *six*. 6am. This was so I could hang out at the bus stop early and have more time to play on my phone. 1) All of the school bullies were picked up on my bus, so any more time than how much I already had to spend with them was a nightmare, and 2) This was years ago. Most I would do is text a few friends and play some Tetris.

If I didn't get up at EXACTLY 6am or before, she would threaten to ground me. Never understood her logic. I was never even late to school the entire time I was attending."
SuicideWatch,fdnuhz3,t3_emb53l,1578593093.0,"I don't know what you believe will come for you after your death, but I hope that it's something peaceful. I obviously don't endorse this and I could go on and on about how you should just hang in there and wait for things to change, but our lives are so short that many people just run out of time before things can get better.

I agree with most of what you said. Life's pretty dark on this side of the planet too, but thankfully, there are a few people who do truly understand, and by lending a hand can actually save lives like yours.

So if you happen to change your mind, drop me an IM. You're more than welcome to send paragraphs my way if you have anything else that you need to get out of your system. I wish you all the best, and hopefully in the next life this world will treat you better."

MinionMasters,fc491f6,t3_eg264p,1577409914.0,"Y'all weak af. Literally ALL of these cards ^ have such hard counters or easy strategies to cope with. Here are a few tips:

*Your 1-2 mana cards are some of your most valuable. Bahra and Nyrvir especially take around 4~ seconds to complete an attack, giving a more high DPS troop MORE than enough time to sneak in there and do some damage while you use one of those lower cost minions as a sacrifice.

*Don't? Play spells? When Xiao Long? Is on the board? Or be ready to instantly kill/distract him when he gains his buffs. Seriously, in 2v2, my mate normally fucks this up - it ain't rocket-science, smh.

*Just use a god damn Cursebearer to kill the Dragon. I direct you to Jackeea's comment for literally everything I don't address from now and onwards.

*Shield is WEAK, like, hella weak. Chain-lightening that shit when the enemy has some minions near their tower to get your money's worth.

*Don't play swarms in front of Wreckinator.  He's one of the strongest ANTI-SWARMS in the entire game. Dragon welp, or any seriously tanky troop or air troop can take care of one of them for as little as 6~ mana. Defenso is also your friend here.

*As Jack said, if you can't deal with Ghost then I dunno what to tell you, mate. This is rookie stuff. Literally ANY troop in the 180+ of them in the game that isn't a melee-ground unit can kill that thing in two seconds."
