trees,ff86qay,t1_ff54vq9,1579667556.0,I have 2 kids and a full time job. Can't just be high all the time lol
ExpectationVsReality,ff86nji,t1_ff7doux,1579667492.0,There isn't a percentage on the can
ExpectationVsReality,ff86mhl,t1_ff758ty,1579667467.0,Nope I've been eating it for 30 years. Never experienced a can that was less than 60-75% full. This one didn't even have enough to make one sandwich.
Periods,ff52s4c,t3_erf5hr,1579578661.0,"I had the paraguard for 3 months. I bled to the point that I was basically hemorrhaging and I even passed out from blood loss. I went to my gyn and he told me that there was no way the IUD was causing it and that I needed to take birth control pills in addition to the IUD to stop the bleeding. It was 2 weeks after that that I passed out on my bathroom floor and had an emergency appt with a different gyn who said it was absolutely the IUD, I was having a serious reaction to the copper. He removed it and 2 days later I had quit bleeding. I'm also really sensitive to metals, can't wear anything but solid gold or I get blisters."
stopdrinking,ff2e901,t3_er8d79,1579502535.0,"This is exactly how I feel. Felt like time was going too fast, but wasted precious time drinking instead of enjoying my kids. Because of work and school, evenings and weekends are the only time I get with my kids, and that's also when I drank. I'm so glad I'm present now and enjoying being a mom. Sometimes we'd miss birthday parties or events on the weekend because I'd have to stay sober in order to drive to and from. So much guilt, but so much gratitude for the future. Thank you for sharing."
MadeMeSmile,ff2d5wl,t1_ff2ca44,1579501372.0,"Now that you mention it, he does kinda resemble Dave Grohl. He's also a percussionist and played some Foo Fighters in one of the band's he was in."
NatureIsFuckingLit,ff2btra,t3_er1q25,1579500006.0,It's bedazzled!
trees,ff2bjvu,t3_er309e,1579499729.0,My friend rigged up a hot boxing device using an air mattress pump. It was pretty insane. You can get an entire room of people high in seconds. Next challenge?
trees,ff29c2v,t1_ff28tmm,1579497645.0,"I feel overstimulated too, come to think of it. And that's probably what causes the irritability. It seems like the task I'm doing plus my kids trying to talk to me plus any music in the background, it's all suddenly too much."
MadeMeSmile,ff26j8d,t3_er7l03,1579495218.0,"Wow. If you see anything ""sick"" or anything other than innocent about this picture then there is something wrong with YOU."

alcoholicsanonymous,fej2d43,t3_epa2yx,1579154332.0,"My bottom was realising that the only reason I hadn't actually hit rock bottom was because I hadn't ""got caught"". So many nights, if one thing had gone slightly differently, my life would have been in ruins. If I had gotten pulled over with an open container and alcohol on my breath, if I had gotten into an accident with the kids in the car, if I had stumbled to the left instead of the right and fell off the cliff into the ocean, if my kids had woken up while I was in a drunken rage. Reflecting on all these times when things could have gone so wrong, that was my turning point. What if the next time I wasn't so lucky. What if I ruined my kids life, or killed someone. I don't know if I'd be able to recover from that. But I'm pretty confident I can recover from where I am now. I'm glad I didn't wait for things to get worse."
depression,fej0oae,t3_ep842q,1579152722.0,Be the most important person to yourself.
alcoholicsanonymous,feiy3lu,t3_eoxmke,1579150440.0,"I went to my first meeting tonight. I understand now that God refers to whatever your higher power may be. I was raised with a Christian mother who was strict about the Lord's name in vain and no false idols or other gods and whatnot, so it's hard for me to see references to God and not think religion"
alcoholicsanonymous,fehr2t9,t3_eoxmke,1579122187.0,Wow. My perspective has completely been changed. Thank you all for taking the time to explain this to me
alcoholicsanonymous,fehpkgy,t1_fefubqw,1579121319.0,Unfortunately I live in a small town that doesnt have an agnostic group. There isn't even an open meeting every day of the week. Our town isn't on the app yet either. I think I just need to get to a meeting
Periods,fecl8br,t1_fec94kl,1578976668.0,"If you bleed enough to overflow one and have blood pool inside you then you're dying lol. Sometimes it leaks, but it's not a lot, just wear a panty liner."
Periods,fea9q9k,t3_eo0f4x,1578946032.0,I wonder if a blood spatter crime scene investigator could determine the position and velocity of thrusting
Periods,fea9glt,t1_fe6xng9,1578945939.0,"You can't get infections from period blood, unless that person has a bloodborne infection (like HIV or Hep C). Also, it's my blood. And my husband has been plenty exposed to it. I'll wash my sheets as I normally would, and hopefully you've been enlightened and don't continue to spread false information that ""that stuff"" aka menstrual blood causes infection."
aww,fdtnu5h,t1_fdtns9q,1578719481.0,Yup!!
LifeProTips,fdrow22,t3_emriub,1578687575.0,"Seriously can confirm. I was homeless for about 6 months. I lived in Portland Oregon at the time and I made sure my money went to my transit pass and gym membership first. I had a membership at 24 hour fitness, so it was open overnight. I showered at the gym, and even slept on the benches in the dressing room a few times. I slept on the Max (the train) often too. Both places had cameras so it was a much safer option for a 23 year old girl to sleep than many other places."
