billsimmons,ffe3mqr,t1_ffe2kt8,1579835831.0,"Literally every other grunge band than Pearl Jam. My preference would be soundgarden, stp(not really grunge but linked in often), nirvana, mudhoney. All of them before Pearl Jam with Eddies incoherent babbling and McCready’s 14 year old blues guitarist snorefest chops. U2 and REM are probably more 80s bands with a little early 90s bleed over. There’s tons of bands who didn’t suck from that era. REM at least has some creative stuff. Peter Buck was good. I just can’t stand Stipes voice. U2 is just elevator music someone decided was rock. Yanni pan flute solos are more rock n roll than anything the edge has ever cranked out."

And they getting the bone from his policies too. The worst part of all of it is exactly what you said about your vote in your state. The electoral college is really outdated. Hopefully we can eventually get it changed to a popular vote for president, and have voting day become a national holiday. I’d actually be in favor of mandatory voting too like is done in many countries. You can vote to abstain, so the option to not choose is still available, but it eliminates the voter suppression crap we deal with here. It’s always been odd to me the constitution only requires one thing of citizens, and that’s jury duty. I think voting should be on equal footing and be mandatory and East. Vote by mail. National holiday. Move it to a Monday or Friday and have polls open all of a 3 day weekend. Much more early voting options. But high voter participation probably fucks both parties. Either way, hopefully Bernie can win your state primary and shock some change into the system. I’m actually with you in the Bernie, yang, warren preference order."

Aside from the fact we’ve done that. We’ve been getting worse, that’s a comment spoken from a position of privilege because the getting worse is not radically affecting you. For many people, it is very much affecting them. From the tax cuts, to snap work requirements, to the situation on the border, all things Biden wouldn’t have done. You’re in a position where you can ride it out. Millions aren’t. It’s lazy and cruel to not vote to stop the bleeding because you can ride it out, when others can’t."
politics,ffduxfc,t1_ffdrq45,1579829547.0,"Well vote in the primaries. You may not like Biden, I don’t. But it’s pretty petulant to not vote for him over trump. I agree he’s a dog turd. But he’s like a dog turd outside that no one picks up. He stinks. It pisses you off. But trump is like a big, hearty batch of diarrhea left in the top tank of the toilet. One does more damage. At this point, no change is better than bad change. Yeah, Biden is old and out of touch and not going to change anything, but he’s not going to change anything. It’s backwards thinking to just hold the status quo in a shitty spot, but it’s better than actively making things shittier. I honestly don’t think trump cares about making things worse, but I do think he’s a moron and people can capitalize on his ego and get him to sign shitty bills. The last tax cut is a prime example. Biden wouldn’t have passed it. Trump did. It’s gonna widen the wealth gap even more, and by a lot. The recent example of undoing Michele Obama’s lunch programs. Trump did it for spite and so Cisco can get more profit out of schools. Biden wouldn’t have done that. Biden won’t do anything, but, again, that’s better than doing a bad thing. All that said, feel the Bern in the primaries and let’s get him elected and vote the GOP out in all other elections."

But any good contract will cover things like that with severance packages. I have a lot of experience working with UAW, unions work entirely different than from what is said on this sub. There’s a reason why factory closures take years. They pay out severances, normally have to offer early retirement to those who may be eligible, have obligations to find jobs for employees at other locations etc. obviously there’s probably a big difference between that and a writers union, but part of forming a union is to protect against someone just shutting it down and leaving everyone high and dry too.

He’s a bit older than those of us who first got Facebook in college so that’s always made sense to me that his wife runs it that way to try her best to keep some kind of contact with him and old friends.
