One possible option for you is telemedicine, depending on whether you have insurance and whether it covers telemedicine services.

At least in my case, it costs far less per visit than an appointment at the doctor's office."

My biggest fear is that, if it is cancer, my parents will lose it, and I'm not sure I can handle that. My mom was calm when I told her about my lump and even gave me a pep talk, but if it is cancer, I can see her freaking out. I've derived some strength from her calm demeanor so far, so I'll be a wreck if she loses her composure.

I have a breast lump that I'm terrified may be breast cancer, and now every little pain, ache and pressure is potentially cancer. I understand what you're going through, but what I can say is that you should have even less of a reason to worry than I do. 

It is statistically pretty rare for someone your age to get cancer. And though it may seem like so many young people are getting cancer for no reason, the reality is that the vast majority do not. Young people without cancer don't really announce that they don't have it, so when a few do it makes the condition seem more common than it is. 

And though cancer is not uncommon overall, there's just so much of a focus on how awful it is and so many stories in the media of people battling cancer that it's causing a lot of unnecessary fear and anxiety like that with which we are dealing. 

Are you seeing a primary care doctor on a regular basis, at least? If not, do you at least have access to a resource that can provide you with medical advice or guide you in the right direction? I'd suggest using those resources to help alleviate your anxiety."
