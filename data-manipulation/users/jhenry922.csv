Some like fishing take place because you only need a very small amount of energy to trigger a large release of energy. Others work in the reverse that to make this transformation you need a large input of energy. When a massive star collapses into a neutron star and go to Supernova a lot of things happened very quickly. First thing, the heavy elements at the centre mostly iron Etc collapses almost at freefall and the material heats up incredibly quickly and its density increases massively as well one of the refrigerators that you have available to cool this reaction and strip away energy from the claps in materials are neutrinos which passed through virtually all matter like it wasn't even there. These carry off most of the energy of a supernova explosion which is why astronomers are so keen on new trying to observe because these are the first things that will arrive that Earth to give them warning about a supernova.

However, as the material in the core of the star reaches and then exceeds the density of neutron material i e the nucleus of an atom weird things start happening. Let me try those that are being formed massively are now being absorbed by the collapsing material as it is so dense it is no longer transparent. This heats up the material again. Then what happens is either the central part of the stars now then snuff to either form a black hole or a neutron star but you still got an explosion. 

The outer part of the core rebounds off this interior that has stopped collapsing it gets flung into the outer parts of the star. With the huge excesses  of neutrons present you get the formation of all kinds of exotic atoms like gold uranium at Etc and this all gets flung off into space."
