E: also, that is seriously the cutest baby elephant ever!"
BeAmazed,ffl0yns,t1_ffkfasx,1580032772.0,Yum !
interestingasfuck,ffkssh1,t1_ffksha2,1580028237.0,"Thank you! It was fun while it lasted.
Edit: I guess I have a little more time. I thought it’d be over at midnight."
oddlysatisfying,ffksetc,t3_eu3pkq,1580028047.0,I don’t know about this. Sand always finds a way to creep into everything. I don’t trust that it’d stay sealed in the window panes.
mildlyinfuriating,ffkqcex,t3_eu30gd,1580027041.0,That woman (?) needs a lesson in respect  - and safety. Would this be considered assault?

trashy,ffjwmx7,t3_eu08q7,1580008969.0,That laugh is the aural version of a punchable face.
BeAmazed,ffjn4d6,t3_etyozg,1580002085.0,Eat... no.  Yeet!
interestingasfuck,ffjm8dv,t1_ffjip1y,1580001487.0,"Aw man, thanks for letting me know! I can’t believe I’ve lost so many opportunities for karma by doing real life! (Only said partially in jest!)"
interestingasfuck,ffiw6fc,t3_etui8k,1579984172.0,"I came to the comments to discover why someone would specifically have a person artistically arrange spices, only to find that it is a jigsaw puzzle. Most of the comments show that everyone else thought the dude made a spice graphic too, so I don’t feel quite so alone in my thinking."
instantkarma,ffim7m4,t1_ffil2tu,1579977223.0,Player 3 has entered and it **still** cuts off too soon!!
holdmyredbull,ffilv7m,t3_ettwv0,1579976988.0,I had to watch this 5 times to make sure that it was real or CG I. I still couldn’t decide and had to read the comments to discover that it is real. Mind is blown.

Ulta,ffhhofv,t1_ffe1s97,1579935692.0,Did you get the 20% off from the IT cosmetics? It’s saying that the foundation I want is excluded from coupons. I know that’s the usual way but does this special promotion allow the discount?

nextfuckinglevel,ffg9g08,t1_ffezol5,1579901323.0,I just can’t picture that. When I slow it down the sticksnake first appears in the upper left corner. I don’t understand how the trajectory of what the dog potentially could throw would match the appearance of the object on the opposite side of the screen. Maybe someone can map it out and we’d know for sure.
PeopleBeingJerks,fffolk0,t3_etc8th,1579888424.0,Same [guy](https://reddit.com/r/iamatotalpieceofshit/comments/eta9lq/patient_with_fever_removes_mask_on_female_nurse/)?

interestingasfuck,ffep8ng,t3_et7ewe,1579858537.0,"When I read the title, I expected some anthropomorphizing bs, but it really does look like he wants to play! I don’t know if I could resist at least throwing him a snowball - as long as the snowmobile had decent traction and could jolt me out of harms way."
nextfuckinglevel,ffelm19,t1_ffel3kf,1579853274.0,"If you slow it down, you can see the thing in the air looks like it was thrown from either the human or someone behind the human, unless the dog can boomerang yeet."
Ulta,ffeic4o,t1_ffds5y5,1579849182.0,It looks like I can get individual ones too. Have you tried the pore tightening one?

Unexpected,ffegl6w,t1_ffe12t5,1579847195.0,"My dog says that every time they escape the fully fenced in back yard. All wood, board on board 10 foot fence and they just scamper out from under the 1.5 inch gap under the gate. Poor dog gets so disappointed when they escape."
Ulta,ffe7gdg,t3_et2mhr,1579838744.0,"I don’t know what is up with the downvoting, but I’ve upvoted everyone. I appreciate all the answers, and I’m getting some good ideas!"
MadeMeSmile,ffdh7g4,t1_ffdgzje,1579820796.0,That’s some kind of Freudian slip you got there.
interestingasfuck,ffbmsuq,t1_ffbl8jz,1579773175.0,Wouldn’t that be about the same time the ink runs out?
