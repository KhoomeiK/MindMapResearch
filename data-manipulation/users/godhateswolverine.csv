freefolk,ffk953i,t1_ffk6wy7,1580019003.0,I had to look closer to make sure that wasn’t him
joker,ffk7wfb,t3_eu2mwm,1580018422.0,I have that same one. It’s my favorite of all time.
Instagramreality,ffk2g8a,t3_eu28bc,1580013747.0,I don’t see it. Even the shadow has a booty. My butt looks like that but from weights. I’m curious too!
JusticeServed,ffk1su5,t3_etq4bd,1580013193.0,She was the clown of the sound on the radio station morning show I listened to the other day!
news,ffk1r3z,t3_etyli6,1580013152.0,He’s currently in the city I live in.
UNBGBBIIVCHIDCTIICBG,ffjzag2,t1_ffiao1h,1580011080.0,All because his WoW was taken away.
aww,ffjypuk,t1_ffjjwrp,1580010627.0,"My friend has one, he’s an old man now. But he’s neurotic as fuck. He’s apparently been that way since he was little. He’s cute in his own way though. He’s constantly chewing his fur. I’ve seen others and they’ve been normal dogs. I always call my friend’s heeler Ed- inspired by the hyena from lion king."
BeAmazed,ffjyg0s,t1_ffjxmgr,1580010409.0,"I always feel how hard my heart is pounding during an attack and it makes me freak out more. The dizziness, hot and cold flashes, constant shaking/tremors. But hearing my heart always makes it worse during the attacks. I always freak out more that I’ll have a heart attack. Then I’m exhausted for the next few days no matter how much sleep I get."
harrypotter,ffip1ro,t3_etuysq,1579979170.0,Enjoy! I reread it over the summer after 15 years and still loved it!
astrology,ffhdrn3,t3_etmosf,1579931152.0,I’ve realized how unhappy I am at my job. Severely stressed that I’ve lost five pounds this month from being hungry but just unable to eat. Realizing more and more my mental health can’t suffer much longer as I’m at my breaking point and being fed up.
trashy,ffhdbwc,t3_etmoy4,1579930690.0,What the fuck
Instagramreality,ffhcz9o,t1_ffh47dk,1579930339.0,"I actually care for the right FAR more  than the left. She looks cute. So I’m not sure where you got me tearing her down from. The left is unattainable and looks 40. Making an observation such as that is tearing someone down? It’s not.

It was her team’s editing, the make up, plus the exaggeration of the lips that have been a thing for the mid-life crisis housewives for the last several years. The right picture she looks more refreshed even with the surgery compared to the left. The right makes it look like she’s making a funny face that I would make at friends versus it being frozen due to the surgery."
Instagramreality,ffgr635,t1_ffglruz,1579912966.0,She looks normal but not her age and it’s due to the insane amount of surgery done. How about the girls seeing these beauty standards and finding THEMSELVES unattractive because they don’t have the bought and paid for features of the above? That actually seems pretty fucking shitty considering the above and her family constantly contributes to this unrealistic trend. Pointing out this isn’t real isn’t shitty- it’s helping the other people realize they can’t achieve this standard of beauty unless they pay for it. Get the fuck on.
Instagramreality,ffgb11a,t3_etb7bf,1579902296.0,Aw she kinda looks like she’s 25 in stories instead of the 40 year old in pictures. That’s all I got.
Instagramreality,ffgavyt,t3_etcr6w,1579902210.0,Man she was gorgeous. She still is. But the bolt ons plus the top are photographing weird. I don’t know if it’s PS exactly but it definitely looks weird.
AmItheAsshole,ffg9l5i,t3_etgtnf,1579901411.0,"NTA. I wouldn’t leave my daughter with someone I had been dating for five months, even if he’s great to your kid. It’s weird he’s as pissed about it as he is. Not sure if it’s a red flag but it seems so."
Instagramreality,ffg9ajl,t3_etd8fc,1579901230.0,Who is this? Someone message me so I can look. I haven’t seen her on insta.
videos,fffi58d,t1_ffehamz,1579884474.0,They should be sued. I do insurance mold is SUCH a serious issue with claims. It’s ridiculous a hospital covered it up. They should be the first line of defense against this happening when their patients are there.
videos,ffee1tx,t1_ffdg6me,1579844563.0,The recurring mold issues is definitely something to mention too. How many times now have they found it?
coolguides,ffedglc,t1_ffdns7v,1579843988.0,Maybe.
coolguides,ffedbj4,t1_ffdyka6,1579843854.0,Now I know how how to do the Starbucks bites and better chicken at home. You’re the best.

beetlejuicing,ffebpy6,t1_ffckc6y,1579842361.0,"Love you three, you beat me!"
trashy,ffb3nf8,t1_ffazvmx,1579750951.0,I think she went to a few a few years ago. She definitely has friends who do. That’s probably it.
trashy,ffazns1,t1_ffakfn7,1579748208.0,That’s weird as shit. We’re the same age! But I’ve never seen him and god do I hope not to even more so. I’m clearly out of his age requirements but still. That’s just so fucking creepy.
trashy,ffagcuy,t1_ff9sd09,1579735107.0,Hello fellow Washingtonian! I saw the same thing! My friend who was friends with him (says she doesn’t know how) sent me the comments after I shared it on my personal Facebook. Shit is insane.
trashy,ffag9wc,t1_ffa2gcg,1579735053.0,He was posting hella comments and tried to say he was 20.
trashy,ffa1n5l,t3_esdti9,1579726078.0,"I saw this same post from friends. Some people tried defending him, his friends did, but saying he was hacked. Apparently he has been active since the posts and are not saying he was hacked at all. Fucking disgusting. They had his picture and name posted. He really asked if he could catch a charge when the girls tinder profile said 16. Crazy to see it here!"
trashy,ffa1bgy,t3_esew5c,1579725889.0,The parents should never have children again. I hope the guy gets some of the harshest punishments possible. The poor little girl.
insaneparents,ff59cx0,t1_ff59aan,1579584162.0,Hearing Black Honey live has been one of the best experiences in recent years. Loved it! I think they’re coming back to WA and may go again!
insaneparents,ff590mk,t1_ff5850g,1579583847.0,That entire album hits your soul in a certain way.
