offmychest,fe4cqjf,t1_fe4bvtk,1578857931.0,you ever been in this situation? who knows how this grown man is going to react?
offmychest,fe4bcxi,t1_fe4b17s,1578857553.0,"if u had bothered to read any other comments, i didn’t want to make a scene. i’m going to target today though to get it settled, oq."
offmychest,fe49oku,t1_fe497yh,1578857100.0,"it’s hit or miss, some women get murdered for speaking up and others get murdered for not saying anything"
offmychest,fe458rx,t1_fe44efi,1578855917.0,"normally i would agree, but i got a really nasty gut feeling about him. i mean, who is trying to steal toothpaste and dog food?"
offmychest,fe41out,t1_fe41din,1578854941.0,"exactly, i’m going to get a small one to keep on me whenever i go out alone i think. my state is open carry as well."
offmychest,fe3zf32,t1_fe3z3wt,1578854300.0,i’m really considering getting one actually. i used to be very anti gun but after this i’m not too sure.
offmychest,fe3w6ch,t1_fe3vmzp,1578853431.0,the sales are unbeatable & their clothes are cute
offmychest,fe3w1al,t1_fe3vtk9,1578853391.0,"i mean i’m mexican, but he followed me out of the store, and waited for me to leave after he paid."

offmychest,fe3f13t,t1_fe3e7rr,1578848718.0,"“babying” are you upset that people are upset about a 40 year old man following me around a store with a camera on me? also before you deleted it, i saw the comment of you accusing me of karma farming? i feel bad for your kids if you’re going to blame them for any shitty thing that happens to them. just because it happens to most women, doesn’t belittle anybody’s situation. if ANYBODY came to me with a situation like this, or even less invasive than mine, i would sympathize. because it fucking sucks. you’re saying that i’d have to get physically assaulted or murdered for it to be a “big deal.” get a fucking life and get off your fucking high horse."
offmychest,fe3d15m,t1_fe3cqzz,1578848184.0,"that’s what i’m going to do. i’m waiting for my dad to get home though, that way i don’t have to go alone."
offmychest,fe3bs0a,t1_fe36gfa,1578847870.0,"honestly, fuck you. you’re the reason people don’t come forward idk why you’re on such a high horse and so worked up over somebody else having a scary experience. you’re just as bad as the perpetrators who commit these crimes. 

“grow a backbone.” learn empathy and understand not everyone is confrontational and fear can make you non confrontational. this happened YESTERDAY a 40 year old man had his phone ON ME. shut the fuck up."
offmychest,fe3awjs,t1_fe2pk6z,1578847654.0,"look up the Kelsey Smith case. she was shopping at dillards, which is a high end store, and got followed around and murdered. not every kidnapping/assault happens in sketchy alleyways, it can and does happen everywhere.

offmychest,fe2rt44,t1_fe2ro46,1578842190.0,i will. thank you :)
offmychest,fe2rptx,t1_fe2qt9f,1578842142.0,"ur triggered over my post though. i don’t see why you felt the need to belittle my situation. this is the first time
this has ever happened to me while i was alone and i was unsure of what to do. if you’re this big tough guy, cool, not everyone can be in these situations. again, fight or flight kicked in and i chose to run."
offmychest,fe2qru6,t1_fe2psio,1578841857.0,thank you for this :)
offmychest,fe2qkv0,t1_fe2pk6z,1578841786.0,"idk why ur so mad? women have gotten kidnapped outside of target, walmart, malls, etc. hell, women have gotten attacked on campus at my university. being non confrontational does not equal weak. fuck off?"
offmychest,fe2p993,t1_fe2nufz,1578841387.0,"i’m not very confrontational and i’ve heard too many horror stories of women telling men to leave them alone and they end up getting murdered for it or go missing. i don’t think i’m being dramatic, because he followed me out of the store. but you do you."
offmychest,fe2m6d3,t1_fe2lp7y,1578840394.0,"being followed around by an older man is extremely scary. every day there seems to be another missing girl my age. i’ve never been in this situation before and didn’t know what to do. if you had a daughter, how would you feel about a man in his 40’s following her around with his phone out?"
offmychest,fe22znb,t1_fe21gw8,1578833939.0,"not all men, but typically men are the usual perpetrators."
offmychest,fe22v4u,t1_fe21wks,1578833887.0,"i was worried about making a scene and didn’t want to  come off as dramatic i guess. i realize that could have quite literally cost me life now, and i regret not speaking up."
offmychest,fe22dn3,t1_fe210wd,1578833760.0,"thank you for this, i appreciate it."
offmychest,fe1yxr4,t1_fe1yktx,1578832524.0,i think that’s what i’m going to do. i was worried a police report would be seen as dramatic but i’m worried for other women’s safety in the future.
offmychest,fe1yt27,t1_fe0ogok,1578832464.0,"i emailed target earlier and i’m probably going to go back in with my mom and dad within the next few days to see if anything can be done about it. the more i look through the comments, the more i’m starting to wonder about why he was there in the first place? it seemed like his sole intention was to find someone to follow."
offmychest,fe1ydp9,t1_fe1xous,1578832310.0,"men typically don’t like being confronted in my experience. a college student recently got murdered in a parking garage because she denied a man a lunch date. so no, i didn’t want to confront him."
offmychest,fe1rsxj,t1_fe1pqav,1578830197.0,"will do! the more i think about it, the more i wonder what the fuck he was actually doing."
offmychest,fe0l2jk,t1_fe0kw81,1578815341.0,"no yeah, i was just worried about being followed home or something."
