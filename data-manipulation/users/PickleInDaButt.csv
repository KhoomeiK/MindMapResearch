A woman dressed as a clown came out with a balloon hopping about and her balloon popped. She started crying. Her clown friend came out and consoled her. Suggested they pray to God and so they did. Miraculously another clown came out with two balloons and just so happened to give the other clown who lost her balloon her extra one. The message was through the power of prayer, God will provide grace.

I went home and played Godzilla on my NES. Godzilla kept kicking my ass on one level. I prayed that God would allow me to defeat Godzilla but could not defeat him. I asked my mom why God didn’t help me with Godzilla. She gave me some excuse, don’t remember it. Probably something along the lines of He’s got more important things to deal with, like that high school football championship Bubba Lee needs to win through His grace.
