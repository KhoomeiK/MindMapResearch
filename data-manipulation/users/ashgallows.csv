selfimprovement,ffd1ci0,t3_essczw,1579811479.0,"I feel the same. 
I feel a bombardment of negativity from the media,from others, as well as from within myself.
If i attempt to find friends, they are too preoccupied with finding a woman and make it the primary focus of discussion.
The women around me are either status obsessed or flat out disinterested in me.
So i concede that it's not going to happen again, i had an ok run, i guess 36 is when its too late, despite what they say. 
I try and make it alright. 
I try to let the thought die.
But when the day drags on into the night, i feel empty, hopeless... excluded.
When i look for advice its always the same, be someone else, be someone you are not because what you are now isnt good enough for someone to want.
Work on yourself, get a distraction, a hobby, go to therapy. Except you are still alone, even in the crowd of the city. 
A ghost in a world where there are still bills to pay.
There is no good really, only avoidance of the bad.
So you become bitter, angry...introverted.
Of course no one wants you now, who would?
Be happy, be someone else.
I wish i was. I wish i could. But i cannot.
The cycle continues.
I have nothing useful to tell you. Only that I'm in that place as well.
We are not victims, we are still here.
We do suffer though."
audioengineering,ff21ydr,t3_er42vc,1579491614.0,"There are a couple things that can help you out with this.

1. Start mixing from the vocal and bring up the other instruments under it, then make a notch in the 808 where the lows sound good in your vocal. 

2. Sometimes dipping out certain mids can give the appearance of a deeper sound, 300-1000hz are pretty good for this. 

3. Try Copying the vocal and low passing it so that the range you want is the only thing there, then compress the hell out of it and sneak it under the main vocal. You may need to flip the phase in the copy, maybe not."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,fezn73f,t1_fez9sso,1579459246.0,"Yes, if you say turn up the ""q"" on a shelving filter it can produce a bump at the cutoff point, but that isnt strictly cutting, thats cutting and quite clearly boosting at the same time. I feel like the op would notice a big mound on the display if this was the case and would not be asking this question.  As far as say, pulling a bell eq down 10db, i cant see for the life of me any way that makes a signal louder than it was, esp to the point of clipping if your gain staging is within a normal range. Not sure why i got negged for saying that, it seems pretty basic to me, if someone can show me something contrary to what i said in a session im certainly open minded about it."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,feypf1s,t3_eqw98t,1579448677.0,"Everytime you cut a frequency, you are literally making the signal quieter somewhere along the spectrum. Unless the eq has some sort of level compensation turned on, there is no way it can get louder if you are strictly cutting."
selfimprovement,feom6fi,t1_feo9ht9,1579302004.0,"Not sure how hard it is. Ive been doing it for 25 years. Its a sense of immediacy really. For me, a start time of something means being ready to begin the second it becomes that time, so i get there early to ensure i can do that. 

Showing up late would drive me crazy."

DecidingToBeBetter,fel9blf,t3_epi1z9,1579216882.0,"An odd thing to do is to say to yourself "" when (x thing) happened, i was very sad"" and then talk about it. For some reason saying it to yourself distances you from it a bit."
audioengineering,fegr65y,t3_eos0ij,1579100608.0,"Yep, post your mix on gearslutz. Literally thousands of people on there, some of them pros, who will point you in the right direction. 
Forums are great for this kind of stuff."
audioengineering,fecnoy8,t3_eo7x1h,1578978501.0,"Just because someone uses a piece of equipment, does not make it right in the chain you have going (v30's are the devil to me now). Pay attention to the inherent qualities if the gear you use. If you use a head with a bunch of mids, a cab with a bunch of mids, and a mic with a bunch of mids, its almost impossible to get it right with eq. You match pieces of gear so they balance i.e. bright mic with a dark mic to make a full balanced signal.

starting the mix from the drums is not always best, esp with fast metal."
socialskills,fe6sqy4,t3_ent281,1578903650.0,"If you treat your outings like an experience, peoples connection to you matters less.

For instance, being like ""hey, i wonder what ill get into this time"" is better than, ""i hope i run into my friends"" or in this instance, acquaintances.

This works even better if you feel bad about, say not being a hit with the opposite sex. There's no pressure then, and you can actually enjoy yourself and feel good about the outing, instead of going home all like ""no one likes me"".

Its an experience, like watching a new movie for the first time, there are no expectations, only new avenues."
IWantToLearn,fdp8xz2,t3_emgjff,1578622777.0,"Some have mentioned this in different words, but for me, its the concept of a center.

A way to put it, or better yet a personal dialogue is:

""I am calm, safe and capable. Things happen around me, but not to me, they will be dealt with in my own time. Nothing is too hard, nothing is beyond my capability.""

Something like that.
If you notice you are starting to freak out. Unclench your jaw and return to that statement. See how it goes for you."

selfimprovement,fcuzfbk,t3_eixloq,1577991567.0,"Usually one thing unlocks a bunch of others, for me it was caffeine. I cut the amount i drink in half, and it made me less anxious, which in turn made me more confident. It also made me eat less, which helped with my appearance.

What many people in self improvement dont have is a foundation. You need to understand that the world has done everything in its power to make you submissive and avoid criticism at all costs. You must understand that you are fine RIGHT NOW. You are allowed to have opinions, you are allowed to take up space, you are allowed to be wrong and not feel bad about it. You are not a slave to other peoples expectations, you are a country in and of yourself.

Once that sinks in, you generally have more balance in your life."
audioengineering,fcu74os,t1_fcu6usm,1577974154.0,"The crazy thing is...im using behringer right now. I saw a youtuber use it and he jad sone pretty good stuff. So far, its better than any interface ive used. The drivers are good and the pres sound just as good as the scarlett, maudio or digidesign units ive had in the past"
IWantToLearn,fctwtbe,t3_eiwcvr,1577963559.0,"If its blood tests you are afraid of, drink a ton of water beforehand, it makes the process hurt less and makes the collection go faster. For me, having the process go well a few times makes the fear lessen gradually for the next time."
audioengineering,fctvpgu,t3_eivuvg,1577961962.0,"Focusrite has some really crappy drivers. I had to toss one of their smaller scarlett interfaces for doing crazy things to my sessions that had no explanation. The pres might be good, but its meaningless if it say lets small amounts of your drum tracks print on to your synth tracks when the routing says everything is fine. The moment i got another interface, all the ""mysteries"" stopped."

Also, to get better help, you need to post a clip or outline a specific thing that is giving you trouble. 

Metal and rock  are all about guitar, imo its usually best to start with the guitars and mix everything else around them."

You haven't failed, youve taken a shot and missed. 

You need a different degree sadly, i have an audio production degree as well, its pretty worthless, even getting into a studio doesn't necessarily require it, at least mine didnt. Make music on your own, and go for a degree that pays. If the music takes off, good. If not, you still have rent money. Im doing a computer science bachelor's right now.

Tinder is cancer, especially for men. You need to be ok on your own and not need a woman. Trying to convince someone to like you never works out well, they either do or they dont and thats how it is. Find peace on your own and eventually a woman will find you.

Work on yourself, work out, eat better, research things that interest you, hunt for better jobs. Invest in yourself.

Im a 36 year old man, 2 years divorced, former audio engineer, working on my degree, making music and working on myself. Keep going. The path is there."

MurderedByWords,fc8u80p,t1_fc8prwj,1577542047.0,"Not really imo. Then again, im of the opinion that each hero should have A story. Not 25 reimaginings and reboots. I feel like if you continually change the origin, traits, and motives of a character, that nothing matters then. 

I can see doing that, if its a storyline with different characters i.e. the crow, or the green lantern. It makes sense then, seeing as they are different people occupying the same title as it were. But say, making wolverine a fat, lesbian, Philippino woman who's from prague would make no sense to me."

Its an abbreviation for the name of my people to me, nothing more."
