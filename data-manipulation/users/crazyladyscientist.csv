The problem is that it seems all of the people who walk their dog off leash have no control over the dog, it's aggressive and comes barreling towards you at 50mph while they barely look up from their phone. I'm so fed up with having to fight off dogs divebombing us while we're just trying to walk and mind our own business.           
Personally I don't walk my dog off leash because his callback is good 99% of the time, but it only takes one time for him to get distracted and run into the road, or get into something he shouldn't."

 I identify with this deeply. My dog is 167lbs and not really a dog-dog. He loves people and tolerates most dogs fairly well, but would really rather they just left him alone.

I see way too many people insisting their dog could never hurt a fly and then putting that same dog in situations where it could be a risk to others and it drives me crazy.
