You want to work on Canadian Pride? Grow some yourself and learn about this country and what makes it great, and stop looking to the USA for how to feel. It’s pathetic."

The thing **Libtards** hate is they think everyone gets to be a royal, everyone is a magic snowflake. They don’t understand that for almost three hundred years the Windsors have been our Heads of State — since well before *Confederation*.

They don’t understand the history of this proud nation, and the Sovereign under whom they serve.

If she didn’t continue the softness in her arm movements, or space the strikes out by raising her hands so high, she wouldn’t get the same results.

I’m not saying it isn’t odd-looking, or particular to her personal style, but calling that “pretentious” is way off."

The fact is that moral relativism — the credo that both sides are subjectively entitled to pursue their own ends and that none of their actions are any better or worse than their foes’ — is reckless.

In war there are some actions which are mostly just, some which are mostly unjust, and then a big fuckin swathe of grey in the middle between those two. That’s the no man’s land, and that’s where a lot of the killing happens and the uniforms there are hard to tell apart.

But to say that nothing on either side is ever clear or worthy of judgement is incorrect."

When we insinuate ourselves into other people’s lives it can make us feel important, but co-opting other peoples’ drama is in the end a very shallow business. Reddit is infamous for this problem and it’ll never go away, but the least we can do is resist the temptation to over-react, misdiagnose, and issue reckless mis-statements in the absence of sufficient evidence."
