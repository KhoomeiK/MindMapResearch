I try to just send it to voicemail like always, this crazy drunk ass tries to answer my phone, now I am getting pissed. It makes the gps go away and in downtown Denver I need to see where I am going. I tell her, anymore of this crap I am kicking you out... she tells me that was rude, this is a 35 min ride on a slow night. So I push on, then she just reaches down into my cup holder, grabs my drink and helps herself to the rest of it. I am now officially furious, but the drop is only 8 min away... she asks me why I am mad.... really? Then almost starts crying saying I hate her, and all this other bs. I assure her I do not hate you, I just want to get you where you need to go. Thats my job. She says, Oh I will buy you another drink, to which I reply "" No thanks, that would just make this interaction last longer. "" . I get her to the stop, here is where the fun begins, it takes me 10 min to get her out of the car, when she finally does. Since it was a scheduled ride for 20 min after I picked her up ( either she knew what she was doing, or just outright being a turd ) I finally get her out and I was just gonna go about my night. Wasn't even gonna rate her badly, it was over, shd was drunk, I just wanted my money. But because of the scheduled ride bs, she cancelled the ride as I was about to get paid. Now she has officially fucked up. Pulled over immedietly and called Lyft. Got my money, and now she is banned lifetime from Lyft... I should have known better.
