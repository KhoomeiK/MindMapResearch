Actually... I do.  Thank you for noticing.

But I'll stop being a dick and respond more seriously.

>Doesn't mean it's bad either.

And that's the problem.  We have a whole generation of gamers who grew up on games that set a low bar so low and they don't even realize the potential for the greatness that could have been.

I've been gaming a LONG time and I always figured by this point we'd have evolved the ideas from the late 90s by using modern technology to fully realize game developers' visions from back then.  But I feel like games have devolved.

Not all of them, mind you.  There are stand outs here and there.  But the most popular games, and therefore most influential, are patronizingly simplistic and derivative.

So when you say it's not bad either, I'm countering with why are we not shooting for greatness?  Not bad either is sufficient, but why are we settling for that?  I honestly don't understand your logic.  I'm being sincere here, not trying to be jerk.

>And it does mean that these people who do this for a living, win awards, and earn billions...

I could give a shit about awards and billions of dollars.  I get that videogames are business, I'm not naive.  But these awards shows are a farce.  I don't know the players of the industry personally so I'm allowed to shit on some people here.  Geoff Keighley's award show was shown to be hilarious when TotalBiscuit made a parody of it from a few years ago.  As TB demonstrated, it's all arbitrary.

So bringing up awards and billions of dollars as a measure of artistic quality is irrelevant.  I'm talking purely about artistic merits here.  Don't get off topic.

>It says. It's in the paragraph that you replied to. It's a case by case basis. Some of it is good, some of it is bad. Cutscenes aren't bad, some use of cutscenes is and others it's great.

Again, I never said cutscenes are ""bad"" whatever that means.  I said that, more often than not, there are better ways to convey information and story other than through a non-interactive cinematic.

Not sure how you took that as to be that all cutscenes are bad.  See what I mean about you projecting and making stuff up in your head about what I'm saying?

>Completely ignoring it by replying point by point. OK.

You're cherry picking the easy stuff to reply to.  But you're either misunderstanding or completely ignoring the intent of my argument.  That's what I mean by ignoring.  Simply replying is not addressing what I'm actually saying.

>No, dude. You don't get to decide that BLUE CHEESE isn't REAL food because it tastes like shit TO YOU. You don't get to tell people that they are a lesser artist because they use spray paint instead of paint brushes. It's ridiculous.

Why don't I get to tell people that they're lesser artists?  Because I think I just did.

>And, even funnier, telling award winning, genre-merging, boundry pushing developers: ""You guys are wrong. I know better."" when you haven't actually had to make a game and overcome those challenges and come up with an adequate solution to the problem cutscenes solve.

Alluding to authorities again.  And as if awards actually mean anything as we've established.  It's all circle jerking just like in Hollywood.  A bunch of players in the industry patting themselves on the backs and giving ""awards"" to each other.  That's hilarious to me...

I have made games and overcome challenges and come up with adequate solutions.  And I've also seen many developers who have far better solutions than the easy cop out solutions that we see so prevalent in these mediocre games that you seem to love so much.  I have experience and admire developers who actually know what they're doing.

You're projecting so much, dude.  You don't even know what I'm about and you're making all these assumptions, haha!  If you'd listen instead of reacting so emotionally to what I'm saying because you're disagreeing, you might actually understand that I'm not trying to be an asshole.

I genuinely love videogames and want to see them be the best they can be.  I want to see the games fulfill the potential that the medium has to offer.  I want them to go beyond the mediocre crap that we see far too often.

I'm not sure why you're being so defensive.  Why are you so butthurt?  Seriously.

Are you developer?  Did I accidentally shit in your cereal?  What did I do?

>Developers will continue using all the tools available to get their (wrong) vision across.

Not the good developers.  They'll make great games that us ""real"" gamers will enjoy ;)

Haha, I'm fucking around with you a bit.  But in all seriousness, videogames have room to improve.  And I just don't think we're there yet.  Doesn't mean I don't enjoy them as they are.  But trying to deny that there's better ways to do things is how we get stagnation."

truegaming,ffp0gxo,t1_ffoveku,1580084013.0,">Why not? It gives exposition that sets up the movies, upcoming scenes, lore, and everything else.

I feel like I'm repeating myself a lot.  But something being prevalent doesn't mean it's a necessarily a good thing.  Yes, it sets up exposition.  What I'm saying HOWEVER, is that it's not the BEST way to do exposition and provide information.  There are better ways as the ones I've provided previously.  You don't want to simply tell, you want to show.

This was what I was saying all along.  And when you see these techniques used in a film, all I see is less-than-ideal storytelling.  If you're fine with mediocrity, more power to you.

>Whenever possible... which isn't always the case obviously or the best way to get some information across.

Right, it's true.  And I'm pointing out these moments where a movie fails to do something ideally.  What's your point?  Because mine is that they're being ineffective at story telling.  And that we should avoid them.

But you're wrong.  By showing instead of telling, in fact, is the better way to convey information.

>Changing words now. It's not the best or worst expect on a case by case basis. Some games will do a lot better with camera control, good voice acting, and others will not.

Nope.

Also you're being extremely vague with saying stuff like ""some games"", ""better"", ""good.""  Dude, you gotta be specific.  I can't even have a conversation with you here.  Provide me examples and tell me specifically why you believe what you do.

>What about a briefing before a mission? Are we supposed to be moving our heads around? Stand up and walk around? Pick up random objects and put them down? In that case, it's a real life cutscene. You sit there and listen.

What about mission briefings?  You're projecting so much and making up things that you believe I said, when in fact I've stated none of the suggestions you listed.  Haha!

Dude... I CAN very much address the rest of your post but I'm not going to because you're being too silly.  You don't stay on topic and completely ignore everything I bring up.  You make up stuff you believe I'm saying and arguing against these made up points.  Also, I'm very lazy and feel I've said all I wanted to already.  And it'd only be a waste of my time because you're not listening to anything I say.

But to summarize...

I NEVER said that cutscenes can never exist in a videogame.  I DID say that non-interactive cinematics have their uses at times.  And I'm saying that when you're arguing a point, the onus DEFINITELY is on you to provide examples and information to back up your argument.

However, non-interactive cinematics are lame.  I'm playing games to interact with the game world.  If I want to people talking in extended sequences, I'll watch a movie where it's being done better anyway.

This is an arbitrary number, but I'm going to say cinematics are acceptable if they constitute 10 percent or less of my gaming experience.  Any more and it's just creative masturbation from the game designers and artists.  10 percent satisfies all those nitpicky things you brought up like mission briefings, providing exposition and plot narrative, character building, etc.

Anyway, agree to disagree.  But I still think you're wrong.

Also, your point about professionals knowing more than a ""lowly"" peasant like me who hasn't had a game under his belt is fallacious reasoning.  Classic alluding to an authority.

truegaming,ffonhv6,t1_ffnyk48,1580079564.0,">They do it a lot of times. They show you a book passing pages quickly while someone narrates. They have two people sitting in a bar giving exposition about what's happened, happening, etc. It's literally a device to give people as much information as possible that cannot be filmed for various reasons.

I agree that this does happen in film.  And it's not a good thing.  Like I said, it's ""telling instead of showing.""  Whenever possible you want to show instead of having characters outright say what's going on.

For example, if two characters are talking and one of them wants to say that someone has died.  You can convey this information through much more than dialogue.  You can maybe use a cutaway as the person reminisces about the passing, the actor with the bad news can use facial expressions and body language to imply their death and the other person will respond accordingly, maybe the bearer of bad news can show a memento of the deceased, etc.  Much more powerful than someone just saying, ""He's dead.""

Just because it happens doesn't mean that it's an ideal way to handle story telling.  Similarly, videogames have cutscenes but I'm arguing that it's not the most powerful way to convey narrative and is under utilizing the medium.

>Because you didn't like it? OK. That's cool for you. It was pretty fun to watch it and decide with my family. Sorry you didn't like it, but that doesn't make it terrible. Just not for you.

This is a weak argument.  You have to substantiate this with more than ""it's just not for you.""  Because I could turn that around and say that just because you like it doesn't mean that it's good.  We'd go around in circles all day.

I, on the other hand, explained exactly why it's stupid.  And pretty much everyone else agrees because no one else is really watching this gimmicky bullcrap that they tried out.  ""Pretty fun to watch"" isn't exactly a ringing endorsement for something such a mind blowing experience that you seem to want to make these interactive shows to be.

But if you're not claiming it's mindblowing, then I'm right.  Adding interactivity, though an interesting experiment, is not an ideal way to watch shows on Netflix.  People can experiment all they want, my point is that it's not effective story telling.  And to be frank, it's just stupid.

>No, it's that your examples and analogies are bad and that your opinion is that ""games should never have cutscenes"" is silly to me.

>That everything must be interactable and played through.

I never said that, you're putting words in my mouth and making stuff up in your head.  I even admitted that brief and sparing use of cutscenes can offer exposition and additional information.  What I said was that whenever you put non-interactive moments in videogames, you're not using the medium to its full potential.

For example, in movies you can have text on the screen that says ""10 years later...""  That provides information to the audience.  BUT what I'm saying is that there's probably more effective ways to show that.  Showing a distinctive character that's all grown up but still has the same characteristics would be a pretty clear indicator that ten years has passed, playing some music of well known genre would convey the era that we're now in, or showing a change in cars or characters' clothing, etc.  So many possibilities to convey information without explicitly TELLING the audience that ten years have passed.

On top of that, you can still put that text on the screen.  But at best, it's now superfluous.

To me, non-interactive cutscenes are like that piece of onscreen text in movies.  It's not the most effective way to convey information and most of the time it's unnecessary at best.

>Not all genres are the same. Story heavy genres do well with cutscenes. You make decisions, you do things, you prepare for battle... and then you watch the results of your work unfurl.

You're being too vague here.  You'll have to specify genres and what you mean by story heavy.

Because if you're talking about an RTS or an RPG like Final Fantasy XII where you make tactical decisions then watch the battle play out, that's not a cutscene.

Something ""story heavy"" like the Quantic Dream games do have a lot of cutscenes.  But why don't we just watch a movie at that point?  The decisions we make are trivial anyway.  It's Choose Your Own Adventure in videogame form.  How many Choose Your Own Adventure books and stories do you actually remember?  On the other hand, non-stupid regular novels like Harry Potter, A Song of Fire and Ice, Lord of the Rings, Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy, etc, etc, etc. are the stories we remember.

Videogame Choose Your Own Adventure is dumb just like the books.  It's kid stuff.

>I am not implying. I'm asking. What did you need 4 essays to cover?

>I'm thinking long form essays though and not just a couple of pages. if it's just a couple of essays of a few pages, never mind. Each one isn't long enough to cover it.

This is digressing but if you must know it was for a class.  But I could easily go on longer than four essays.  One was definitely not enough to explore all I wanted to especially if I were to provide specific examples of how which games do things right and which ones do things wrong.  But again, this is besides the point.

>No, they aren't. They are CHOOSING to use games a certain way. There are thousands of other titles which do not. It's an artistic choice. They aren't limiting themselves... they are trying to merge two different things into one. How is that limiting?

Right, and they are choosing wrong.  There's tons of dumb art.  Limitation creates the best art.  That's why a guitar with six strings can create such wonderful music.  And painters with a limited color palette can create beautiful paintings.  A boxer using only his fists operating under Marquess of Queensberry rules offer such spectacular pugilistic entertainment.  Adding more freedom doesn't mean better art.  Otherwise, we'd tell children to not bother coloring inside the lines because we want them to be free spirited.

By being too loose with artistic freedom, art becomes bullshit like so much modern art.  Really?  Taping a banana to a wall?

>No one is doing that. They making videogames with movies in them. Movies which are different depending on what choices you made beforehand in many cases.

Everyone is doing that.  God of War, The Last of Us, Uncharted, Call of Duty, and on and on and on.  What are you even talking about, man?  You can't say things and not back anything up.

Notice how I'm actually specific and provide examples while you just make baseless claims?  This is getting exhausting on my end, haha.

>That sounds like you want to play Desperado, not RDR2 or RDR. Just pew pew pew!

Nope, not at all.  Have you even seen Fistful of Dollars, The Good The Bad and The Ugly, Unforgiven, or any of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns?  Those are far from pew pews.  There's scenes that go on for minutes with no one talking, no high energy action scenes, just long slow shots of the western landscape making the audience soak in the atmosphere.

>This is one of my pet peeves. This hard on for ""immersion"" that gamers have. Somehow, cutscenes do that, but... say... carrying 8 weapons? Nah.

Immersion based on the rules of the world.  Everyone is willing to suspend disbelief if the rules are consistent.  You're nitpicking people's words instead of trying to understand what people are trying to say.  I'll admit as I did earlier, I'm clunky with my words and analogies.  But it seems like, because you disagree with what I'm trying to say, you're picking apart the semantics instead of arguing the idea.  But I'm digressing again.

Instead of immersion, I would say more it breaks the flow.  It interrupts the state of mind I'm in.  It takes me out of the experience.  Not that it immersion means the game has to be realistic.  See what I mean?

The rules of a game has been established that I can carry 8 weapons around on me and I've accepted that.  But if I'm playing the game and I'm feeling a certain emotion but then the character I'm says something to the contrary of my state of mind, it takes me out of the experience.  There's a dissonance there.

That's why the silent protagonist has always been such a common trope.  Again, JUST TO CLARIFY, because I know you'll get all butthurt about this, it's not the ONLY way to do things.  But it's highly effective because there's less of a chance to ruin player immersion and cause dissonance.

But even with a talkative character like Duke Nukem, his personality is so simplistic and exaggerated that whenever you're playing Duke Nukem 3D and kicking ass, his one liners so often match up with that feeling of you kicking ass that it's easy to accept the situation.

However, once you get a more complicated and fleshed out character put into morally ambiguous situations like in the Red Dead games, the more a character speaks and the more personality they have, there's more of a possibility to create dissonance for the player.

>Cutscenes, and these sort of games, at least give our characters a god damn voice, not just literally but in what happens.

I have my own voice already.  As I said above, giving a character a voice will only create the possibility for it to interfere with how I, the player, actually thinks about a situation.

>I'd like you to watch the ending to Dragon Age Origins. Tell me, how do you intend for them to tell us that through gameplay?

You gotta start providing more information from your end if you want to make any arguments.  Don't put the onus on me.  I'm not going to go watch that ending.  Just explain it to me and provide me with your own thoughts.

But either way, I've been rambling on way too long.  And you say that four essays is too much.  This is just scratching the surface of what I want to say, haha."

truegaming,ffns7sa,t1_ffl5sn4,1580070074.0,"It's because a lot of game designers don't trust players.  And over the years, people forgot what made videogames so great.  As technology improved, somehow people got it into their heads that high budget cutscenes and super star voice actors must be hired and utilized in games.

Play through something like Half-Life and there aren't these problems.  It told a wonderful story without being so explicit with the narrative.  Control was never taken away from the player and there was no struggle at all for creative control.  And if there ever is, control should go to the player.

When the game designer takes control away, it's an ego thing.  Says to me, the designer just wants to show off how ""creative"" they are and that they don't trust the player. 

>There just isn't a way that both artist and the player feel creative in a synergistic way.

I don't care about the artist feeling creative.  It's selfishness.  Art is for your audience otherwise it's just stroking the artists ego and creative masturbation.

>On top of all this is that games are difficult and expensive to make. So game studios aren't taking any risks. So just like movie blockbusters they are made in a way that they don't have any artistic vision and a director to guide everyone towards it. It's only guided by expectations of their fans. Thinking - ""what would they want?"". Instead of confidently presenting a creative work everybody that worked on believed in.

And therein lies the problem.  I get it, videogames is a business too.  But we should ask ourselves, do videogames always need to be such big budget projects?"
truegaming,ffnr4rs,t1_ffl28wc,1580069639.0,"Well put, and much more succinctly than I did, haha.  But yes, you're right.  I'm not suggesting that ""cinematic"" games are bad for doing what they do.  It's just a different style of game.

I mean, I still love the Naughty Dog games like Uncharted and The Last of Us.  But if I'm going to be honest, without the high budget visuals, voice acting, and grand set pieces, the gameplay by itself would not hold up in some other lesser known title.

And gameplay is the selling point of videogames.  I'm not saying that Uncharted has terrible gameplay... but the ONE thing that videogames offer, interactivity, is the weakest aspect of a big budget game like Uncharted?  That just doesn't make sense to me.

There's room for all sorts of experiences out there.  But it's similar to how [Martin Scorcese recently criticized](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/dd131s/martin_scorsese_says_marvel_movies_are_not_cinema/) the Marvel superhero movies as not being cinema.  Because it's true.

I love the Marvel movies for being fun and easy to watch but they're spectacle experiences.  Much like how Uncharted is really fun to play but ultimately it's not a very in-depth experience.

Again, not shitting on different experiences but we should analyze and differentiate.  Not everything has to be so serious because it's just videogames after all.  But the power of the medium can be so much more than simply entertainment.

Like the Assassin's Creed games have the potential to be much more historically educational than they currently are.  With the amount of data collected, when something terrible like the Notre Dame fire occurred, that game has the potential to be used for archival purposes.  Military games could feasibly be used as training tools if enough attention was spent refining their simulation accuracy.  A game like This War of Mine demonstrated the horrors of war from the perspective of civilians without being on-the-nose and heavy handed by showing us a far less effective non-interactive cutscene.  By allowing us to LIVE the lives of these war survivors, it was far more impactful.

Anyway, I'm rambling but my point remains that we could do so much more with the medium than simply trying to make games cinematic."
truegaming,ffno249,t1_ffk0s33,1580068389.0,"> Hmmm. I disagree. I think you do videogames a disservice by limiting what they can and can't do so much.

I'm not suggesting we limit what videogames should or shouldn't do.  But I am saying that when you're using non-interactive cutscenes in a videogame, you're under utilizing the interactive nature of the medium.

As I said in my example with films.  It's as if instead of showing an action scene in a movie, every time it came to an exciting sequence like a fight, a car chase, etc. the movie comes to a halt and switches over to a narrated description of that action scene.

>Counter example: The interactive Black Mirror episode. It was interesting, cool, and would be nice to see more of it. It's just too expensive to.

Terrible counter example, because I tried those interactive episodes on Netflix and thought they were really really dumb.  It was that Puss In Boots Adventure show.  And it wasn't the content because I love 3D kids movies.  It was the format that was stupid.  If I'm watching a show, I don't want it being interrupted by it asking me how to progress.  Just show me the fucking movie, especially when the movie is going to progress regardless if I make a choice or not.

I'd say good idea terrible execution, but it was never a good idea to begin with.  And it seems 99 percent of the Netflix audience agrees with me because no sane person is actually watching those terrible ""interactive"" shows.

>And not really. That would be a filmed narration. Just like an interview isn't a movie. Or anything filmed isn't a movie. Are the news a movie?

You're missing the point I was trying to make.  The medium of motion pictures and recorded audio is being under utilized when you make a filmed narration instead of actually making a movie like Peter Jackson did with Lord of the Rings.

Let's take your example of the news.  Back in the day before cameras and audio equipment, we had newspapers only.  The medium was written words.  But as soon as we were capable of video and audio, how dumb would it be that when news was being reported, we didn't go film footage of locations where news occurred, interview people on camera to hear them tell their eye witness account, show the anchors describing the situation, etc.  What if we simply had the same news story being read straight off the newspaper into the camera without any of the aformentioned.  That would such a waste of the new medium of audio and video that was invented.

See what I mean?  You're getting caught up in the specifics of my examples and I'm being a bit clunky with my analogies.  But all I'm saying is that we should utilize the full potential of each respective medium.  And videogames by their nature offer interactivity.  Any time we take that away from players, we're doing them a disservice.  It's not about being draconian about how if a game has X number minutes of cutscenes it's not a ""real"" game or whatever.

>Anytime you tell people to use an artistic medium under strict rules, you do it a disservice.

>What if they had told painters that they could only use certain canvas? That they could only cover certain images? That they all had to do hyper-realistic painting since it's the ""most technically difficult""?

>Impressionism wouldn't exist since it's ""not painting at it's fullest"" and instead artistic expression.

I agree, we should never put art any under strict rules.  But it's ironic you say this.  Because game developers are limiting themselves by trying to make games ""cinematic"" and being too heavily influenced by film.  You're demonstrating the point exactly opposite of your original argument.  Instead of truly fulfilling the interactive power of videogames, by making games so movie-like, game designers doing themselves a disservice.

It's interesting you bring up artists doing photorealistic renderings of their subjects.  Having videogames emulate the camera shots of films, the virtual actors exchanging dialogue like in movies, the transitions, lighting, compostion, etc. all exactly like in movies is the EXACT equivalent of traditional artists not truly evolving beyond an old medium.  Artists not fully expressing themselves using the potential of a new medium.  How can you not see the irony what you're proposing here?

>You had enough for a series that you couldn't say in one? What do they cover?

Of course, I think about these things in great depth.  I wrote four essays regarding cinematics and interactivity in videogames.  And I still have more to say.  I'm not sure what you're trying to get at by implying that I ""couldn't say in one.""

Videogames is a very new and very young medium and most people, even professionals in the industry, don't really understand it well.  Last year I was studying at a well known game design school in a computer science program.  I was mostly interested in game design but I needed the hard technical skills before I can get to that point.  But what I noticed was that a lot of the more technical minded individuals were great programmers and engineers.  However, when it came to game design, a lot of people seem to make arbitrary design decisions when making their games.

It worked fine in the early days of gaming where you throw everything against the wall and see what sticks.  But in order to evolve the art beyond those infancy stages, we need to think things through more deliberately.  And the industry and medium is at a point where we're afforded the opportunity to do this.

>Limiting what games can and can't do just hamstrings them and leaves them forever in the land of toys. Megamans. Pokemons. Marios.

And limiting games by making them like the movies we all love so much leaves them forever in the land of cinema.  Why show us being Clint Eastwood in all those spaghetti westerns much like the Red Dead games did, when we could BE the Stranger With No Name fully immersed in a wild west setting uninterrupted by silly cutscenes?  Videogames as they are at the moment, is like if you were thrown into West World where you can fulfill whatever western fantasy you'd like, but once in a while something fourth wall breaking happens.  That's what cutscenes are to me.  They break immersion."

truegaming,ffjutp2,t3_etx21m,1580007560.0,"Nope.  I actually wrote a series of essays on why cinematics in videogames are stupid.  Although I put it much less bluntly.  But the gist of it is that you're doing a disservice to each medium when you add interactivity to movies or shows.  And similarly, when you add excessive non-interactive moments in videogames you're also under utilizing the power of the videogames medium.

I know what you're trying to say, but it's not as simple a matter as that people have different tastes.

The example I always provide is that say, instead of us getting Peter Jackson's LotR trilogy, someone decided to convert Tolkien's books into film format.  To make a film, we could theoretically set up a camera and have a narrator describe scenes of the adventure that the LotR characters went through.  Maybe show some moving images of scenery, play some sound effects to complement the narrator's storytelling.  This would technically be a movie version of LotR.

However, without the actors, the special effects, the fully realized visual re-creation of Middle Earth, this would be a far less compelling version than what we got from Peter Jackson.  This is an exaggeration, but I'm trying to prove a point that this would be criminally under utilizing the power of the film medium.  It's the classic case of ""telling instead of showing"" in movies.

So with videogames, instead of ""show, don't tell"" game directors should strive to ""let players play, don't simply show.""  Not that there's anything exactly wrong with minimal use of cinematics in videogames because they can provide context and exposition.  But beyond that, why are we simply not letting players play out the scenario and give them full control of that really cool scene that we're seeing?

Games are not ""less"" as you put it for putting in non-interactive moments, but it definitely is under utilizing the videogames medium.  To bring it back to my LotR example.  Say that instead of showing us those really cool battle scenes in Peter Jackson's movies, after all those dramatic storytelling moments, when we get to the combat the story shifts perspective.  We move over to a bunch of still images with a narrator describing each moment of the battle instead of simply showing us all that beautiful choreography and the thousands of foot soldiers in formation.  Much less impressive and effective isn't it?

That's how I feel whenever a game takes control away from me and forces me to watch a really ""cinematic"" moment when I could just be playing it."

But we're not those individuals.  We're consumers who have the ability to choose which game companies to support with our purchases.  It's not just virtue signalling.  Bring this shit up enough and people will realize how fucked up the situation is and be informed enough to think twice before buying and downloading from big game companies who allow for this.

>Game publishers have two choices

No, they have more than two choices.  But it's clear to us that they're about their bottom line.  And I completely understand, but I don't have to support them with my business.

>We might not like it, but the only thing that's ever going to make the Chinese government cut the bullshit is the Chinese people

Appreciate the pep talk, but it doesn't work that way.  You realize China has been around for thousands of years strategizing and the vast majority of the citizens have as much say as those disposable units in Starcraft that you order into enemy fire.

We're not trying to fight the Chinese people's battles for them.  But we don't have to support the companies in our country that bend to the will of an oppressive foreign government just so they can profit.  It's just videogames after all, it's pretty easy to boycott entertainment which will cause these companies to reconsider once they realize their bottom line is being affected.

Of course, this is optimistic idealism because I would never underestimate the tenacity of evil giant corporations to find a way around all this and still somehow come across as the consumers' best friend."

shadowwarrior,ffiga7x,t3_etjiv2,1579973168.0,"Just my personal opinion... but SW2 royally fucked up the formula by trying to cater to the looter shooter fad.  The first game was a solid straightforward action adventure FPS.  The second game improved in a lot of ways with the new game mechanics like additional dash moves, double jumps, etc. making you feel like a real ninja warrior.

But it diluted the experience by having enemies drop all these slottable pickups, variations of the same weapons, and just all sorts of useless junk that I have to sort through pages upon pages of in the menu.  I liked the upgrade system in the first game where you kept your weapons and simply improved them as you progressed through your journey.

I never liked the looter shooter genre but now I especially hate it that it bled over into Shadow Warrior, one of my favorite revivals of a 90s era oldschool shooter.

Oh, and now instead of handcrafted maps, the developers even went the whole route of randomly generated environments.  I really just don't know what they were thinking.  They took a perfectly good formula that was the first Shadow Warrior and did everything possible in their power to ruin it all.

Like I said though, SW2 isn't all bad.  Because it looks and plays better moment to moment.  The story is still as entertaining as the first game.  The weapons are still fun to use.  But fundamentally at its core, it's now a looter shooter and I just couldn't enjoy it for that simple fact."
