SuicideWatch,fckamlf,t3_ehlm8x,1577720976.0,"The fact that you care about others speaks volumes. You, staying alive is helping someone else stay alive as well. Your purpose in life at this time may be to reach out to others and help them survive their darkest hours."
kratom,fck3l3d,t1_fck3cbr,1577715565.0,"Many MANY people are dying from illicit opioids which are far more dangerous than RX opioids because you don't know what they consist of. So the government is making things far more dangerous for the public by forcing opioid prohibition and that pushes people to the street, making the black market expand for opioids. But the media is silent on that. Also stop and think about this-""More people die from cigarettes and alcohol than on RX opioids and illicit opioids."" ""SHhhhh"" is the media's motto on these opioid truths."
kratom,fck3cbr,t1_fck2z4i,1577715353.0,"Yes, I have had a script for more than a month. And I use Kratom as well. I work with Pain Patients that have devastating injuries or life-changing illnesses (thousands of them from all across the country and even in other countries)/Physicians/Medical Researchers that study addiction so I fully understand the impact of opioids on addicts and pain patients. Did you know that the CDC LIED about the number of people that died from RX overdoses? Also it's your experience that they are mentally and physically addicting-that does NOT mean that everyone feels the same way."
SuicideWatch,fck319i,t3_ehfwhk,1577715084.0,"First of all, you are NOT a piece of shit just because you are depressed. You are a human trying to navigate the deep waters of depression which can leave you feeling confused, guilty, ashamed, heavy emotional pressure, numbness and anger. Please don't feel guilty of having negative feelings. You need to remember that depression lies. Write that statement on your hand in marker/pen so your brain remembers that at all times. Don't die. The world needs you because you have unique gifts that you haven't even discovered yet. That will come with time. Give life a chance to bring you positive things."
kratom,fck2h5j,t1_fcjotb6,1577714592.0,Agree with you.
kratom,fck2dpn,t1_fcj50sg,1577714506.0,>We need to get a few things straight. Millions are NOT dying from opioids. The problem in America is illicit opioids not prescription opioids. Addiction to opioids only occurs in less than 2% of people. Just because someone has a script for opioids doesn't mean they are instantly going to get addicted. That's a myth that the media loves to spread. There is a smear campaign against RX opioids because they are trying to push Suboxone down everyone's throats. They push this drug on pain patients and addicts even though its not intended for chronic pain. It's a scam they are running in America to push Suboxone and buprenorphine on pain patients so they can milk their insurance money.
