> This search returned 4347 non-duplicate articles. We then performed a hand-search of journals known to address transgender issues as well as existing literature reviews on the topic of gender transition and transgender well-being. From this search, we selected additional studies that appeared to address our research question. On the basis of title reviews, we narrowed our list to 589 studies that appeared to address our research question. We then read the abstracts of those studies and further narrowed our list based on whether the studies directly assessed well-being in the context of gender transition. This process yielded 124 studies. The final step of our search was for two reviewers to independently read the full text of each article to determine if it directly addressed our research question. We eliminated studies, for instance, that did not assess the outcomes of gender transition, that investigated minors instead of adults, and that evaluated physical rather than mental health outcomes (because we did not want to conflate assessments of specific surgical techniques, for example, with the broader question of whether gender transition improves well-being). We identified 56 peer-reviewed studies consisting of primary research that met all the above criteria. We then classified them according to whether they found improved well-being, had mixed or null findings, or found that gender transition causes harm, and reported both the number of studies in each category, as well as eight findings that emerged from our review of the literature. Separately from the 56 studies we evaluated, we included in our portal 16 additional articles that consist of literature reviews and practitioner guidelines that we did not count in our tally. We provide these as an added resource for researchers, practitioners, journalists, policymakers and the public with an interest in transgender care issues.

The results are not a compilation of all studies on transitioning, theyâ€™re a result of selected studies. The methodology section literally states that no hard reqs were set for the study design. 

Itâ€™s very ironic that you decided to attack the Arif studyâ€™s validity by raising the poor construction of the prostitute study.

actualconspiracies,fem4fd3,t1_f8dglzv,1579239405.0,Spoken like a true spook. The question here is: why should we listen to these particular spooks if theyâ€™re not going to make public hard evidence in favor of their claims?
