“He calls his mansion not a house but a tomb”

“Vampire Money”

“Vampires will never hurt you”

“I’m in love with all these vampires”

That’s one from every era of MCR so why should this one be different"

Their reunion post said 

Like phantoms forever which references IBYMBYBMYL

Then they posted skeleton man with a knife which could possibly be referencing TCFSR

then the hospital bed which could be referencing TBP

 now the car and the  DD referencing Danger Days

 so logically the next post references MCR5"
facepalm,feldjkb,t1_fel5rjg,1579219648.0,I believe you should be able to drink at 18 as well. I believe that beyond the age of 18 there are very few things the government should restrict. Much like the Ccigarette law that just passed that I disagree with. I’m saying that people should be held responsible for their actions and that the government shouldn’t stop them. Because not all people develop at the same rate. Someone who just turned 18 and is mature enough to make that long term financial decision should be able to and shouldn’t be restricted just because someone else wasn’t ready.
