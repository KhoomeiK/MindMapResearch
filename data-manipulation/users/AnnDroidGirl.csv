Our houses were on different streets, but we had a fence between us that we could climb over so we didn't have to go around the long way. Anyway! We played at each other's house and one day, we got the stupid idea to throw a kitchen knife at a tree and try to get it to stick.

I somehow got in the way of one of his throws. I still have the scars."
