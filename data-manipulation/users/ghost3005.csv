depression,felbnyk,t3_epiyby,1579218401.0,"Wow, I've been doing this for as long as I can think.
When I was about 4 years old I started to daydream about the lion king and other childrens films. But I didn't imagine the characters to be my friends or to be comforting. Instead I dreamt of myself neglecting and sometimes killing lion cubs.

Today it's depending on the mood I'm in.
When I'm depressed I imagine a world where catastrophes happen. Accidents, someone trying to hurt me... Pretty bad stuff. 

When I'm better it's more about having friends who care for me and about myself accomplishing things I'm not able to do in real life. Being a good friend, finding a job I enjoy, being loved unconditionally, making music, being as intelligent as the people I like being with.

Sometimes I feel guilty and ashamed for my fantasies when I'm badly depressed. Even still for the things I imagined as a child.
Feel like I could have become really bad person if depression hadn't kicked in that hard.

I'd like to know why I feel comforted by those destructive drama fantasies which I definetely wouldn't enjoy in real life at all.

Did someone else encounter something similar? Would love to hear your stories and theories."

depression,fdkw608,t3_elqwy9,1578512404.0,"For a long time I blamed my parents for my mental problems. My father neglected my sister and me while my mother was at work.   
Some day she came home to find him standing over my crib, pressing a pillow on my face to silence me because I was screaming. I was 9 months old.  
She left with us after this. I didn't really see him after this.

Later I got into fights with my stepfather. Verbally and physically. I hated him for a long time and at this time I already was pretty messed up. I often was told what a demanding baby I had been and later that I had been the one who had started the fights with my stepfather. I was basically blamed for everything bad happening to me and my family. I was demanding, aggressive, lazy, loud and annoying. When I brought a good grade from school nobody really cared. I was punished for everything I did wrong even if I didn't realize what it was and I never experienced something like approval or respect for the good things I did.

Over the time my parents stopped treating me like that. Now they (mom and stepdad) try to be supportive and they do a lot for me. But I feel like the damage is done and nothing they could do could help me in any way. 

I'm getting sad every time I am with my (patchwork)family. I'm like an outcast. I see everyone being happy together, loving each over. All my siblings have a great relationship to our/ their parents. I've become the black sheep. The only one who constantly feels out of place, has no goal in life, never made it to highschool and probably never will - while half of my family are teachers and the other half are doctors, managers, project leaders...

Today I tend to blame myself for my depression. There is no sense in blaming others anymore. I could just leave and become a better person. But I lost all my will to change for a better a long time ago. I think I have all it takes to have a wonderful life. Most people like me, I have no mental or physical barriers... 

And that's what nowadays gives me depression.   
I could change it all. But I don't. Also I'm not the one with the real problems. I have a roof over my head, help from people, even people who care about me even though I don't know why... And I still can't be grateful or happy. Maybe I'm just a bad person.  
Or dumber than I thought."
depression,fdks49y,t1_fdk7pnb,1578510006.0,"I feel you. Sometimes I get really angry and annoyed when my longtime friend tells me that I'm strong and well progressing in life... Because it's a complete lie. I work on 5 out of 30 days at a youth hostel, hating every single shift there. I have to go to a school-like thing 5 hours a day to get social care. I hate my flat but I can't afford a better one. At the same time I think a beautiful living space would be a waste for someone like me who doesn't really earn money, is irresponsible and pretty picky when it comes to things other people don't even have because they are the ones who are really poor and have the real problems. I feel like I'm a bad person for having depression because I could make my life better if I really wanted to. I just could try and it'd probably work out. Instead I do nothing and keep bathing in self-pity. I also don't think that it will get better. It's like I already wasted the best years of my life.I've had depression since my childhood years and in my experience it only got worse over time despite having therapy for many years. 

Sorry for eventual bad or confusing grammar 'n' stuff. English isn't my native language.

But I really do hope for you, me and everyone else that we will find a way out of this.

I guess there is still a glimmer of hope inside of us. That's why we are here, sharing our struggles with others like ourselves. At least that's something.  
Not being completely alone with all that's going on in our darkest moments."
