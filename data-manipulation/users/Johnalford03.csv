depression,fe051il,t1_fe04o8g,1578803248.0,"Thanks appreciate it, I know that my sleeping pattern isn’t helping me at all, I’m used to working nightshift so I’m really only awake the hours that people are sleeping and sleeping during the day, so I never really get to talk to many people"
SuicideWatch,fdt2tv7,t1_fdt2n17,1578711186.0,I believe everyone can. I’m not saying it’s easy but I do believe that everyone can recover With great effort.
SuicideWatch,fdszovd,t1_fdsz4w5,1578710036.0,Your talking as if I haven’t been there before. I’ve attempted suicide and I’ve lost close friends and family to suicide including my best friend. I know how hard life can be trust me. Maybe it is indeed harsh to say that people who have committed suicide are ‘cowards’ but I stand by that I feel as though ending your life is more cowardly than persevering and not attempting suicide.
SuicideWatch,fdsyup9,t3_en0a2v,1578709729.0,"It’s quite the contrary my friend, I find you to be the strong person because you managed to persevere and are still with us today. As much as it pains me to say it, the coward is the person who has already taken their life."
SuicideWatch,fdsy8ku,t1_fdsxvm0,1578709497.0,I lost another friend to suicide today. I’m trying to stop other people doing the same. I don’t think it’s a good idea to ‘stfu’ when people are in serious need of support and attention. I don’t know your story but maybe instead of trying to hurt people you should try and help them.
SuicideWatch,fdsxqvr,t3_emwdo0,1578709321.0,"It doesn’t make you a coward at all my friend, and it is a hard thing to do but it’s a good thing that you want to make a change, I don’t know your circumstances but I’m sure you’ve went through a pretty tough time and I’m sure you need support right now and I’m happy to give you as much as you need, tell me your story if you feel comfortable and I’ll do everything I can to help you"
