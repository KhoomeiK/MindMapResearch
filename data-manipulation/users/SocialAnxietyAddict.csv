blackcats,ffo76ob,t3_eucrw3,1580074838.0,He looks really annoyed you've woken him from his slumber!

relationship_advice,ffo2ctz,t3_eud1q6,1580073465.0,"You said it yourself, you're still so young! Much too young to stay in a relationship with someone if you're not 100% happy. You have many other relationships ahead of you and honesty with your girlfriend will cause her much less pain in the long run. Tell her how you feel and enjoy being single!"

migraine,fecg0qx,t3_eo7u84,1578973025.0,"My hair is down to my hips. Not good if I have a 3 day migraine, I have to bite the bullet and condition and brush it so it doesn't get matted. If I'm really poorly my fiance has to help me wash it. I feel your struggle more than most!"
aliceinwonderland,fe0ds4i,t3_endkow,1578811152.0,Can I ask where you got this from? It's beautiful!

weddingshaming,fcyg5dz,t3_ejezvp,1578079618.0,"We don't have gift registries that often in the UK so this is such an alien concept to me! I'm getting married this year and me and my fiance have been living together for the last 5 and a half years and have everything we need, I'm not asking for gifts at all! My close family have given us some money towards spending money for our honeymoon but would never ask anyone for money or gifts! Your wedding is about getting married, not making a profit from your friends and family."
