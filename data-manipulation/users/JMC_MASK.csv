2007scape,ffa7kx0,t1_ff93a3n,1579729429.0,But why does it make sense that a pure with 1 def should have an advantage over a main?
2007scape,ffa7eog,t1_ff9x3xw,1579729333.0,What I’m trying to say is we should be able to pvp with our main without a need for a pure. Someone with 1 defence with the same cb level as me should not have an advantage over me.
2007scape,ff8z1ls,t1_ff7in9k,1579700565.0,Woh I never looked at iron man in that way. That’s actually a really good reason to be one. Thanks for that I might give it a shot in the future. I’m constantly trying to figure out ways to make sure I’m earning the most efficient gp/hour.
2007scape,ff8yraj,t1_ff87sjh,1579700335.0,But possibly killing someone for 50k minus supplies just doesn’t seem worth it. We should be able to pvp on our main. Make pvp viable for mains and I 100% guarantee the pvp community would grow massively.
2007scape,ff8y9qo,t1_ff7b73k,1579699938.0,"I would love to do pvp. But every pker out there has a pure all nicely trained up that would wreck my main account. I don’t want to train 2 accounts. I don’t want to make an alt pk pure just for the sake of pking. That’s too much work.

Jagex needs to make defense more useful in pvp. Make having a main a viable pk option that doesn’t require maxed stats. I bet a ton more people would pk if it didn’t require having a 1 def pure, or 45 def or max 70 def whatever the stupid pk build names are. You make mains a viable option, and pvp will become great again.

As it stands new players try to give pvp a shot, get destroyed because some low def 99 str and range try hard absolutely defiles their insta ko specced corpse, and then they switch back to world 330 never to return to a pvp world again. This is why pvp is dying."
2007scape,ff8xmfs,t1_ff7ry24,1579699392.0,They should make defense more useful for pvp. I don’t got the time or energy to train up another alt account just for the sake of it being a pk pure. If it was viable for mains to pk without being maxed I bet pvp would have a lot more players and interest. Which also means more attention from Jagex.

AskReddit,ff7bg9j,t1_few27ks,1579645517.0,Kind of like how we tend to forget our dreams only a few minutes after waking up. Our brain is trying to delete these false memories. Except in this scenario something went weird.

2007scape,ff5jjpe,t1_ff5082r,1579595865.0,Back when I was in college in 2016 people would be playing osrs during class lectures on their laptops lol. Defiantly a well known game
ItTheMovie,ff56r38,t1_ff4qjex,1579581838.0,Nah your in the wrong here. Without him I wouldn’t have seen this awesome piece of work. And he also didn’t say he made it either. Reddit is built on reposts

Here it is. Around the 19 minute mark if you want to skip all the cool mafia stuff.

The very next episode goes into whether or not recycling is worth it. The tldr is recycling is a waste of money, and does more harm to the environment, EXCEPT for metals. Metals are still good to recycle."

Jagex should give us a quest replay ability, so we can speed run through a quest to get what we need, then come back and complete the quest again in a more chill environment."
