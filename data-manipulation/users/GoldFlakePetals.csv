Travel is travel. Everyone has their own way to travel and you did yours. So what if you missed out on what others deem as ""necessary"". 

Please ignore everyone being an asshole. A guided tour is a step. What is important is that you enjoyed yourself. You're more likely to go back now because of this experience surely!! 

Please don't discredit your experience just because what people are saying here."
