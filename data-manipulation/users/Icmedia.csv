The ATM receipt initially said that they were making about 10% available immediately, then the rest would be available in 7 days. The next day, my online account said that it was all available. Great, didn't really need it to be, but I figured it was because it was *from my employer, written on the same account they deposit my standard pay from.*

Two days later, I checked my account and the check had been returned NSF. Since it was the weekend (and my day off) I just figured I'd clear it up on Monday.

I went into the main office, and talked to the head of payroll on Monday. She pulled up their online banking, and showed me that the account said there was about 4x more than what my check was for in the payroll account, so she called the bank and they said someone would get back to her. After lunch, she let me know that the bank told her the money was there, and that the check should have cleared. In any case, they said that they'd manually clear it if it was put through again. So, she reissued the check and I deposited it in the ATM the same day.

When I checked the next morning, it said the funds were being held for 14 days as a ""fraud prevention measure."" I had to call and talk to 3 people for 45 minutes to get them to agree to release the funds whenever my employer's bank cleared the funds.

The ATM receipt initially said that they were making about 10% available immediately, then the rest would be available in 7 days. The next day, my online account said that it was all available. Great, didn't really need it to be, but I figured it was because it was *from my employer, written on the same account they deposit my standard pay from.*

Two days later, I checked my account and the check had been returned NSF. Since it was the weekend (and my day off) I just figured I'd clear it up on Monday.

I went into the main office, and talked to the head of payroll on Monday. She pulled up their online banking, and showed me that the account said there was about 4x more than what my check was for in the payroll account, so she called the bank and they said someone would get back to her. After lunch, she let me know that the bank told her the money was there, and that the check should have cleared. In any case, they said that they'd manually clear it if it was put through again. So, she reissued the check and I deposited it in the ATM the same day.

When I checked the next morning, it said the funds were being held for 14 days as a ""fraud prevention measure."" I had to call and talk to 3 people for 45 minutes to get them to agree to release the funds whenever my employer's bank cleared the funds. Surprise--they were made 100% available the very next morning.

What a huge pain in the ass."

Then, the company that manufactured the glasses had to come up with a non-standard screen print to place the text *exactly* where the designer specified. And, being so close to the rim, it probably cost a pretty penny.

A salesman had to convince a bar owner/manager to buy these. ""It'll be a clever gimmick-you'll sell twice as much Blue Moon!"" he posited. He closed the deal, and was able to hit his goal just in time to put the down payment on his layaway Christmas presents.

The bar manager probably held a special, mandatory meeting with his staff at like 9am on a Saturday, just to demonstrate the 'proper' method of serving a Blue Moon. Everyone except him thought it was a massive waste of time and hated him just a *little* bit more for it. 

And then, on a random Tuesday night in October, the lazy-ass bartender took the time to *select the proper glass* for my Blue Moon, *place the cut orange on the rim,* but totally just say ""Fuck it,"" when it came to the printing demarcating the proper 'Orange Slice Garnish' placement.
