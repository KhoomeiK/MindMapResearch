TwoXChromosomes,ffay7yo,t3_es6dlx,1579747250.0,"hi sweet one. i know this may be invasive, but i looked at your prior posts. i wanted some more insight into your situation to see if you are safe.  most posts are deleted but i saw you post about skin picking compulsions, and you said it's likely tied to an abusive upbringing. unfortunately, those of us with traumatic or abusive childhoods often find ourselves with abusive partners as adults. i hope that everyone's comments on this post are illuminating to you that that is the situation you are in now. and it is NOT your fault, it is so normal, especially when you are still so young. but it being normal doesnt make it okay. your husband forcing you to have anal sex is abusive. him forcing you to have sex postpartum before you were healed is abusive. i know you love him, and i know you think he is protecting you from something (""knight in shining armor""), but you need to be protected FROM him. he is a bad person. please let us know if we can help you get away from him, even for a little while. we are all looking out for you and care about your safety, and i'm so sorry this is happening to you."
