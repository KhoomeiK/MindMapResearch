Concerns about stunted growth stem from high joint impact. Kids have growth plates made from tissue near the ends of their long bones. Frequent and high level impact (such as those one might receive through a lot of running and jumping on hard surfaces) can damage these plates which can alter bone growth. 

These plates are generally quite hardy though so it takes a lot of work to damage them to the level that growth is effected. Unless your toddler is doing hardcore flips and jumping from heights they probably aren't going to have a high risk at damaging those plates.
