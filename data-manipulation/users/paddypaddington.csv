NintendoSwitch,ffabjp3,t1_ffa0l32,1579731684.0,Basically games journalists and others like youtubers cant release a review of the game up until a certain time if they’ve been given an early copy. I think it generally lasts until a day or two before the game is released.

ireland,fegfppm,t1_fegf0rt,1579091221.0,From the article I’m under the impression he only meant for gays. I only skimmed over it but it might have included pre marital sex too.
ireland,fef4mbf,t1_feape1d,1579048060.0,I did politics for my leaving last year. I think its only a trial run thats been rolled out in a few schools so far but its definitely there.

todayilearned,fe1td6x,t1_fe0aswp,1578830668.0,Ireland was dirt poor back then. Its within 50 years of the famine that just about halved the population. I’d imagine many wouldn’t have been turning down free whiskey.
todayilearned,fe1s6kt,t1_fe128fx,1578830294.0,No it’s genuinely a thing. You do get some brits chatting shite about Ireland online though so don’t blame you for thinking it might be that.

ireland,fe0b3vf,t1_fdzprfb,1578808351.0,Thats a traveller in their natural habitat. Not exactly an example of your average citizen. Its basically a scumbag telling someone they want to beat the shite out of them.
