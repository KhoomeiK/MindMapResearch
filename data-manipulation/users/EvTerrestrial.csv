mildlyinfuriating,ffohthu,t1_ffmm4xe,1580077727.0,"I had this mentality bad for a while and would return books bought from Amazon if they had slight marks when I got them, exchanged a TV 3 times until I got one without noticable imperfections, phones, furniture, exc.  Having a kid broke me of it."

TwoXChromosomes,ff6sdz5,t3_ervyqi,1579633894.0,"The problem is, fundamentalist Christians believe the pill causes abortion so, to them, abortion and the pill are just two sides of the same coin. Wish it wasn't so, but I grew up around these nutcases."

ATBGE,feskeis,t1_fes2ua7,1579366156.0,Why would someone ever need to be diagnosed with trypophobia?  I can't imagine it getting in the way of normal life enough to need to see a doctor.
todayilearned,fesfr6p,t1_fes167s,1579364701.0,Thanks for helping me rediscover this old gem.
movies,fepear9,t1_feoj4hh,1579318371.0,"I think this is the first movie to succeed in not bringing me to uncanny valley unless I stop and look for it.  Something about the eyes, nobody can ever get the eyes quite right.

Still, that's a huge win in my book."

It was a point and click adventure game that came out while they were still popular so was overshadowed by the Mysts of the genre but it is by far my favorite. Great story and atmosphere but the best thing about it is that most of the puzzles actually made sense within the context of the game so it didn't relt on stereotypical adventure game logic bullshit to be difficult (and it is difficult).

The designer is actually working on a new point and click game called Asylum which I'm excited for if it ever sees the light of day."
movies,fehcrs3,t1_feh4mb9,1579113887.0,I know he's said in the past that time is the exception to the rule. Something about most of his scripts being long enough to be a miniseries. I wish I could remember where I read that interview.

interestingasfuck,fe2qwqg,t1_fe2grxq,1578841899.0,"Why are we getting outraged about something that only seems to be happening in this chain that was preemptively created?  Jesus Christ, Reddit seems more pissed off than usual lately."
Unexpected,fe0ckfx,t1_fdzt5k1,1578809839.0,I feel like that's just part of the experience.  You have that one time you shocked yourself doing this in the back of your head every time you fumble around for the outlet in the dark and yet you never shock yourself again until after you read this and drop your guard just enough.
unpopularopinion,fdzzxhv,t3_enc63v,1578799758.0,"The only time a religious person will get shade from me is when they try to insert themselves into my family's decisions based on moral principles that come from their religion but they believe to be universal.

Otherwise, it's as you say, there's not much reason for me to push atheism. I hope my own son makes the choice himself someday and doesn't feel as if his parents nudged him in either direction (my wife believes and I don't but we're very respectful of each other)."

That being said, I am going to see Little Women alone tomorrow as a 26 year old dude so that will be an interesting new step forward with my self confidence lol"
todayilearned,fd34hu3,t3_ejwxed,1578154703.0,"The thing I don't get is that spending time with my son comes effortlessly, why would I want to do anything else? He's like walking happiness. Why did men ever want to do anything else?"

After about the 30th -- ""Oh are you sick?"" ""You shouldn't be here.""
 ""He's got the pleague!"" -- type of comment I usually just take it off and think, fuck it, you're all getting it now."

amateur_boxing,fcubut2,t1_fctxjl7,1577977336.0,"They have different goals too though.  Weightlifting for body building is to gain muscle mass, boxing focuses much more on lean endurance due to the requirements of the sport.  You can also achieve muscle endurance weightlifting too, so it comes down to preference.  You can (and probably should) incorporate both anyhow."
amateur_boxing,fcubos8,t1_fctjb53,1577977225.0,"There are a ton of articles out there that say otherwise [https://www.coachmag.co.uk/fitness/6739/boxing-burns-more-calories-than-any-other-sport](https://www.coachmag.co.uk/fitness/6739/boxing-burns-more-calories-than-any-other-sport).  Granted, they don't cite sources so it could be bogus and I don't buy the claim that it beats every other sport if you match for intensity, but boxing does use your whole body."

An intense hour of boxing is a pretty great calorie burner when compared to many other excercises and it has the bonus of being fun so you are more likely to stick with it."
