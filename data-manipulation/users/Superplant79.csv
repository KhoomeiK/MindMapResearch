relationship_advice,ffjkpl7,t1_ffjitpf,1580000445.0,"I would like to but she’s been acting as my wingwoman, so idk it could be best to listen to her. If the girl I like asks to go out somewhere should I ask “like a date?” Or is that dumb I’ve never had a gf"

relationship_advice,ffjh57i,t1_ffjdkov,1579998126.0,Should I hint at it more or should I be more blunt about it?
relationship_advice,ffjh2oe,t1_ffjcagk,1579998087.0,Do you know any way I could give her better hints to know that I’m into her so I can see if she’d warm up to them?
dating_advice,ffj4kxa,t1_ffixsi9,1579990237.0,True I should start letting her know soon
dating_advice,ffiwude,t1_ffim1e5,1579984649.0,When do you think I should tell her I want to date? I’ve been told she’s not ready because she got out of a very long term relationship a few months ago

confidence,ff8smgn,t1_ff8auez,1579694515.0,"This started with people at work and we’d just talk about work related things until we became better friends and I learned how to talk lol.

So far when I first meet a girl (introducing yourself will be way easier) we really just say hi and then go on about our days, I’ll slip in something funny sometimes to help break the ice

I can’t tell you what you’d talk about after this stage because it’ll come natural but starting off with just saying hi and practicing the small talk will get you going 

Usually if I have to ask the first deeper question that’s after I somehow get their number (using the casual small talk) and I’ll just say “what do you like to do for fun?” Or something"
confidence,ff8a54l,t1_ff7o0mg,1579670579.0,"Yeah dude it probably sounds sad to some people but I checked my phone a second ago to 5 notifications after just 5 minutes or so and they were all girls

It just feels great that I got through that awkward phase finally and can actually talk to women without freaking out internally. The first few times won’t be great but you’ll learn!

It took me just a few months once I really got myself to not hold back as much"
confidence,ff7m1ac,t1_ff6bqq6,1579652769.0,I wrote more above but it’s just practice
confidence,ff7m0fu,t1_ff6a4lm,1579652752.0,"I started liking a girl and forced myself to talk to her, it was awkward as hell but once I found out that girls don’t think I’m just a weirdo I started getting confident more and more

It’s just practice and being healthy and fit also boosts your confidence as well"
socialskills,ff63mja,t3_eru1oq,1579618301.0,Practicing. Just talk to people and you’ll figure it out there’s really no other way. It worked for my socially awkward ass
confidence,ff63358,t1_ff5kby9,1579617911.0,"I could not not talk to girls at all until this summer, I’m turning 20 in a month but we’re still on the same level 

A year ago today if I showed myself that I have a bunch of new female friends and I can just walk up to them and start a friendship I wouldn’t believe it. 

If I can do it you can too"
malehairadvice,fezuaim,t3_eqzxst,1579461741.0,"Here’s the usual tapered sides and keep the top long response, but I’d honestly think it would work great. His hair looks a bit bland on top how it is.

Maybe even growing out the top and keeping the sides how it is now might produce a nice result depending on how his hair grows. 

If it doesn’t look good then the switch to the tapered sides would be easy and then he could decide with his barber how long he wants the top afterwards"
NeckbeardNests,feztaxf,t3_eqz109,1579461378.0,How the hell does this guy do it

socialskills,femvhgr,t3_epxfx2,1579270692.0,"I had the same problem until this summer (I’m almost 20) you gotta deal with the awful awkwardness and force yourself to socialize because it WILL become normal to you. 

I know no one likes that answer but I’m a guy and I didn’t have a single girl to talk to at all until this fall, and now I have been able to just go up to them at work and talk and I’ve been told I seem very confident now. In the same year I would shake like crazy talking to a girl"
socialanxiety,fejty9q,t3_epigcp,1579185782.0,"I did, I didn’t want to be a loser anymore so I forced myself to talk to people. It’s really that easy but everyone says it’s impossible because it’ll be awkward at first.

Of course it will, if you can toughen up through the initial phase you’ll be confindent"
dating_advice,fegsl77,t1_fegrov6,1579101569.0,"Thanks dawg, I’m about to be 20. The thing is I couldn’t even talk to a girl (no female friends either) until this summer. This year is the year for something I’m sure of it"
dating_advice,fegqvwh,t3_eovym6,1579100414.0,"I’m a late bloomer and I’ve never had a girl instantly like me like the one I just met, idk how to feel. I haven’t been able to develop a full crush, such a weird experience. But it makes me feel better about myself, I’m not as much of a loser as I thought I was"
dating_advice,feekwmb,t1_fedlnk8,1579035827.0,"Well it’s the answer no one likes: Just keep talking to strangers/girls until it feels natural, just like how you are with friends. 

The beginning sucks but omg if I can do it after not having any female friends for 19.5 years of my almost 20 years of existing to easily doing it, so can you 

(Working in retail helps)"
dating_advice,fecgbd4,t3_eocjqr,1578973225.0,"I was awkward as fuck just recently I manned up and just told a girl “hey I just wanted to meet you, I’m ____” next thing I know one of my friends is talking about how that girl wouldn’t stop talking about me, feels great"
socialskills,fe959fq,t3_eo4e6w,1578934337.0,Maybe starting with voice chat like on a video game or something? Maybe a discord with a voice chat that multiple people use to get better and finding things to say?
