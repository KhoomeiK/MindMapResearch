femalefashionadvice,ffwy7n9,t1_ffwv3yf,1580313683.0,"Hmmm I see. I would recommend trying different things and then taking photos in the mirror. Sometimes seeing yourself in the photo gives you a better idea of what it really looks like, I don’t know why. 

The reason why I like the tuck is because I have a long torso and short legs, so if I’m doing a boxy sweater or something, it completely hides my shape and makes me look heavier. So the front tuck or side tuck gives me proportions and sometimes can elevate the look of an outfit."

femalefashionadvice,ffwxs85,t1_ffwslua,1580313418.0,"I heard the spanx ones are amazing! Hmmm well, if I’m doing tight pants, I’ll do a chunkier boxier sweater with a front tuck. But if I do wider leg jeans, I’ll do a tighter to the body sweater. I get a lot of my sweaters at Primark, H&M, Aerie and AliExpress online!"
femalefashionadvice,ffwwb6b,t1_ffw42gf,1580312482.0,Ah thank you so much for looking for me!! I’ve been wanting white booties for so long. I also wanted so say I liked the outfit you did with a cheetah looking maxi skirt and a white floral tube top? Was so cute and unexpected. I love when two different pieces work perfectly together.
educationalgifs,ffwraa1,t1_ffwr03k,1580309102.0,"Yes it’s just pressure and chewing pain, maybe a small bit of sensitivity to cold. 

Pretty reassuring to know you can’t crack a tooth from a filling though. They checked my bite again last time I went though and said it was perfect. I can go back and ask again and see if they can do it a little more though just to be safe? It’s super annoying, I’ve been dealing with this tooth since August."

educationalgifs,ffwpsqe,t1_ffviqau,1580308039.0,"Question, have you ever had a case where a patient has sensitivity in their tooth still a month and a half after the root canal was done? Maybe like a 2/10 pain scale. When I first got it done it was 9/10 pain after but they sanded down my bite and that helped. It’s just weird I still feel some sensitivity. 

Note: my tooth wasn’t infected or dead, it was just extremely sensitive after a bad cavity filling by a shitty dentist and was so inflamed for months I couldn’t chew on that side, so they decided to do a root canal to give me relief. 

Do you think it’s possible the first dentist during the original filling maybe cracked a root in my tooth or something? It’s upper tooth #3."
educationalgifs,ffwpi8c,t1_ffvs81g,1580307827.0,Same. Killed my savings account.
educationalgifs,ffwpezn,t1_ffuwgcb,1580307762.0,"Hi, I’m still having sensitivity In my tooth more than a month and a half after my root canal. Normal? Maybe like a 2/10 on the pain scale. Right after the root canal was like a 9/10, so it’s much better, but I still feel sensitivity sometimes when biting down or chewing (they already filed and checked my bite so it’s not the bite)"

femalefashionadvice,ffvntqb,t1_ffunmgv,1580268525.0,Have you tried leather leggings/leather pants yet? I like doing those with a sweater front tucked and ankle booties. Then you can throw on a long solid color coat thingy

She needs help."

vanderpumprules,ffvkt0x,t1_ffvjrbf,1580266462.0,I’m sorry but I have to respectfully disagree. The Botox in her cheeks and lips are not doing her any favors.
