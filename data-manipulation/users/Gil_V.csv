Get the floss to go under your gumline around the tooth as much as you can comfortably. Slide the floss “loop” up and down the side of your tooth above and below the gumline. The idea is to loosen up the plaque that is clinging to the enamel as much as possible.

Don’t worry about bleeding. Floss every day and that should stop very soon.

Think of it this way - if the floss was between two teeth, you want to get it under the gumline on the front side of one tooth AND on the backside of the other tooth. Do both spots while you are in there."
