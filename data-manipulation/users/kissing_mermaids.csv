depression,fduvwjt,t1_fdukxfw,1578739711.0,"Ok, another question: how do you feel about your penis then? I'm a woman and if I woke up in a man's body, I would definitely feel weird, especially about my crotch, I'm not used to have organs hanging there. So I understand the problem with the testicles, but having a penis would bother me too (even if I didn't experience weird boners anymore after removing my balls)."

CompulsiveSkinPicking,fdsdel2,t3_emx1v9,1578700096.0,"I recently realised that my skin is actually decently good (if I succeed at not picking at it for some time, allowing it to heal), it's just that I like the popping too much, so I'll unconsciously aggravate my pores, minuscule blackheads and whiteheads that are practically invisible, into massive swelling infected pimples, in order to have something satisfying to pop... which is lame and it makes me feel miserable, knowing that I cause my ""bad skin condition"", because I'm too addicted to a weird and gross act that somehow for some inexplicable reasons gives me comfort and relief... I'm my own enemy and I can't win this battle with myself."
depression,fdsbhsr,t1_fdr8bwv,1578698788.0,"You might think that cancer is either ""you die and the pain ends"" or ""you survive and you're fine"", but no, even if you're still alive afterwards, your life can still be highly affected by it.

My grandmother had breast cancer and had to go through a mastectomy to remove the tumor. She survived with only one breast. She was only 40-something.
25 years later she had another case of cancer, but this time it was inoperable and terminal. She died at 72, was one of the strongest people I've known, but still couldn't fight it.

Her twin sister had cervical cancer that made her physically unable to bear children. Years later it resurfaced again and she died because of it. She never became a mother, not that she had any choice in that matter anymore.

Their older sister also died of cancer after seeing them being buried in the ground at their funerals. They all died a couple of years in between. I guess they couldn't bear the pain of losing each other.

You're also a woman, and I feel you about your depression, but please, rethink again your perception of cancer. It's not like in the movies or social media. In real life, it can turn into an atrocious disaster."
depression,fds9nqy,t1_fds89gf,1578697554.0,"Whether or not they wish to know it, they should read it, because they're actually completely oblivious on the subject and write ignorant things while other people go through cancer or see their closest people battle cancer and this kind of comments break their heart."

depression,fds908x,t1_fdrx4wm,1578697097.0,"I'm kinda afraid that after spending a lifetime of being suicidal, life would be then like ""you wanted to die? Here you have cancer now, enjoy!"" and I would have no idea how to handle it. I'm sorry you're mom is going through this, I've lost my grandmother who was like a second mother to me due to cancer, I'm feeling you."
depression,fds86yy,t1_fdr4ln7,1578696559.0,Could you please elaborate more on why you want your testicles removed? I've never heard anyone else share this kind of desire.
depression,fds76o3,t1_fdrpuzm,1578695895.0,Best comment so far!
depression,fds70y4,t1_fdrtbah,1578695790.0,I've seen my grandmother and her twin sister die of cancer and I have the same thoughts as you on the subject. The level of ignorance in this post is astonishing.
depression,fds5yew,t1_fdrngi2,1578695099.0,"You need a better support system than your family. It's not your fault you've got mental struggles and they're not helping you at all. I hope you have friends you can confide in. Just wanted to let you know that your relatives shouldn't act this way and that if you can move out of home, you should do it. It would be better for both parties."
depression,fds45qk,t1_fdrnb2k,1578693978.0,"My thoughts exactly, thank you."
depression,fds3evy,t3_emnl5m,1578693727.0,"Hell no, I've seen two close relatives die because of cancer, there's been 5 cases of cancer in my family, at least that I know of (3 of which were fatal) and I'm afraid that it's hereditary and that I'll have it too and die slowly and miserably like them, watching my body and mind degrade while I'm absolutely incapable of stopping the process.

I prefer to die from paragliding or some other extreme experience than from lying in bed unable to even get up. 

I've had suicidal ideation since the age of 6, been through physical and emotional abuse all my life, been through multiple depressive episodes, felt broken from the start, have ongoing dermatillomania of 10 years that feels like addiction, recently started experiencing anxiety, have some ADD and bipolar like symptoms, yet still, I would never ever wish to have cancer!

I've always thought that depression is like cancer of the soul. I'm familiar with emotional pain. I can handle suicidal thoughts. Death by suicide is still in my power - it's my choice whether or not to commit it. And even though I've been hopeless, abused and filled with self-hatred and etc. I've always been physically healthy. Cancer doesn't ask you if you want to live or not. It just comes into your life and if it wants to kill you - it will. You can battle it as much as you want - there's still no guarantee you would survive. You can do everything you need to live, and still die. You can be willing to live with all your mighty, cancer could still cut you out of this world. I haven't tried to kill myself and maybe I'm ignorant, but in my opinion cancer is as bad as having a mental illness, but not any less. People might not understand me and my mental problems but they never do even when I'm fine, so whatever, I'm used to being alone and misunderstood. And being ill and surrounded by people who love you and want you to live, but you're not sure you'll survive is absolutely heartbreaking, you see how they're hiding their pain in front of you, you see what your condition is causing them, and you have no power over it, you can't cover it, and you're just glued to that bed seeing how people around crumble because of you - that's heartwrenching and I don't want to see this.

I'm sorry, but wishing cancer instead of mental illnesses because you think you'll be treated better is plain attention seeking, they're BOTH EQUALLY HORRIBLE conditions that shouldn't be compared at all. You don't know what you're talking about. I'd rather die of suicide that's been my conscious choice than be crushed by an illness I have no power over."

Synesthesia,fcttubx,t3_ehbdjm,1577959211.0,"I had this a lot as a kid. It was mostly human bodies that would stretch from very skinny to overly obese back and forth non stop. It would usually happen when I'm waking up and have no control over my thoughts, so the visuals gave the impression that they would never end. It would make me feel very uncomfortable and didn't like it at all. I have no idea what triggered them and never heard anyone mention anything similar before. Fortunately, I don't really experience them anymore, I can't remember when was the last time."
