boardgames,ff8o6ui,t1_ff8gaog,1579688479.0,I like Yamatai better personally. Maybe I just need to play Five Tribes more?

boardgames,ff5rvk2,t3_er53c8,1579607849.0,"Lovely collection! I honestly haven't played most of your games, but I'm a HUGE fan of The Estates. Just trying to figure out what that wooden cube is really worth to an opponent hits the spot for me. My only ""complaint"" is the paper checks. I never opened mine honestly. I bought enough small jewelry bags for a full player count (for embezzling) and use poker chips for money. Such a great game. Easily in my top five games right now.


Endeavour is great too, but I've only played it once, so I don't feel comfortable rating it yet.

Edit: Parade and Arboretum are also amazing! I can't get enough of thinky colors/numbers games that aren't trick taking or ladder climbing. Two must owns for card game lovers. I have the Renegade version of Arboretum unfortunately :/"

BoardgameDesign,fcujh5e,t1_fcujbkx,1577982402.0,"If you're just using them to keep count of things, there would be no reason to not use mini cards. Doesn't solve the table space issue, but it would help a ton."
BoardgameDesign,fcuizvh,t3_eiydcr,1577982085.0,"I like the concept a lot. I would definitely say it's worth pursuing!


To keep track of resources, you could (like others have said) use cards. You could have the cards for each resource be double-sided, so that, for example, one side reflects One Wood, and once you get to five, you turn in four and flip over your remaining card that reflects Five Wood.


I think the Star Realms life counter cards do that."

Also, on a related note, don't be a douche canoe when you win. I saw a great quote somewhere that said, ""Always act like you've been there before, especially in the endzone."""

AskReddit,fc25ukf,t3_efiy8s,1577341750.0,"As a man, I would suggest that you take note of a few small details. Are all of the trash cans empty? Is there nothing sitting out on the counters or table(s)? Does it smell really strongly of fruity air freshener? If so, home boy is probably a slob and only cleaned up because he knew you were coming over. Expect that shit to slip as time goes by in the relationship."
