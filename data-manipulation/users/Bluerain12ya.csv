That’s a totally insane, but brilliant idea and execution. Well done!

Now I have this feeling, this...  itch to replicate what you did here in my next build. Maybe not to this extent, but definitely the concept."
AMA,ffj9yqb,t1_ffiqbs6,1579993888.0,"To some extent we have that in Hungary as well. Mostly toward Romania and France.

Romania because of gypsies who supposedly flooded Hungary during the great wars. And sure there some bad ones, but they are not the majority, and for fucks sake, every place has that. Hungarians are certainly not innocent either. Plus, excuse me but who made them that way to begin with?

And France because of the whole Trianon thing. Now, let’s be honest here. Those people who made that decision? All of them are long dead by now. So who are we hating, really? Those who live in France right now have nothing to do with it. Most of them hadn’t even been born yet when Trianon happened. Yet still there are groups and Facebook groups that hate the french so much, I’m embarrassed to hold a Hungarian passport. And apparently I’m a traitor for saying that. One of the reasons why I left that country and am not looking back.

But despite all that, mostly coming from older people and those young ones brainwashed into that kind of thinking and hatred, thankfully, there are people with more than two brain cells who realise this is not the way to look forward to the future. Many of the older generations managed to put aside history, for the sake of the future.

I have seen/met/talked to a very few millennials and gen-Zs who have that kind of mindset, and the vast majority of us agree that we shouldn’t fight each other for the crimes committed by our ancestors. We need to leave history where it belongs, in the past, learn from it, and work together to build a better future. Not just for ourselves, but for everyone we share the planet with, and our children and future generations in order to survive longer than the next few decades.

I can only hope that you and your generation can hold on for long enough to get a chance to do that. Right now, we are not the ones to make the decisions, but if we can control the damage for long enough, it will be up to us to repair the damage and heal the wounds between nations, races, religions, and generations. It will be hard work, but it won’t be long."
