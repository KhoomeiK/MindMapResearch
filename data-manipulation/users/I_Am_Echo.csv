Sadly, it was the opposite for me, Lexapro triggered my BED. I'm now working with a therapist to treat it and my psychiatrist to find a new medication."

I blame his Siamese older sister for teaching him."

I couldn't say no to that tiny, six ounce, little bean. 

She is now a year and a half old. 

And smarter and craftier than some humans I know. -\_-"
JUSTNOMIL,fee34xl,t3_eok8g3,1579025415.0,"Hello fellow polyamorous human! 

I'm going to take a wild guess that your mother and your partner's mother aren't exactly thrilled about your polyamorous lifestyle. 

If so, it wouldn't be that huge of a leap in logic (or really any leap at all) to assume these snide comments are ways of them voicing their displeasure. So no, I don't think you're overreacting at this. 

If I were you, I would talk to my wife and partner and iron everything out about how you all feel about this situation and their behavior between the three of you so your mothers' can't find chinks in your armor. 

And then lay down the law. Basically tell them that the three of you are happy, you have made a decision and you are sticking with it and that you do not appreciate their remarks and tell them they need to respect your decisions.

Your actions after that depend on their response."
childfree,fdyyt19,t3_en80ex,1578784919.0,"Posts on this sub leave me consistently amazed that my primary friend group is still 100% childfree. We range in age from 23 to 32 and are a mix of single, long term relationships, and married, yet none of us have kids. 

Hell, even in my extended friend group, only one couple has kids. 

It surprises me to no end how apparently uncommon that is. 

Good luck on your search OP!"
JUSTNOMIL,fdye6e8,t3_en51yq,1578778767.0,"It sounds like your FDH isn't in the fog and making excuses for her behavior so that's a good start. 

Form a team. A united front against her. Before you talk to him, sit down and write down everything you want to say. Try to keep it as neutral and unemotional as possible. Then sit down with him and discuss this. Tell him things have to change.

From there...well that all depends on how he reacts. But obviously, expect resistance from your MIL. Stay strong together."
cats,fdx66za,t3_en69wh,1578765697.0,"First off, I'm so sorry for your loss. *Internet Hugs* 

Secondly, this is gonna sound counterintuitive, but hear me out: Don't TRY to move on. 

Let yourself mourn. Scream, cry, punch a pillow, eat an entire carton of ice cream. Anything that isn't self-destructive or harmful, let yourself do it. You are hurting and in pain. And that's okay. 

Releasing the sadness is both cathartic and neccessary. Trying to force healing is just going to cause you more pain down the road. 

Once you have let yourself grieve, try and distract yourself. Watch funny YouTube videos that make you laugh, go get lunch with friends, hell, just go grocery shopping. Anything to keep your body occupied. 

When you're ready, put his things away. Make a lovely box and respectfully put them away. If you get another cat, you can then bring it back out and reuse some of the stuff. Or just keep it as a precious memento of your friend. 

I've lost pets that I've had for years. The pain is intense and very real. But I promise you, while you will always miss your friend, the pain will get easier. 

Again, I'm so sorry you lost your little friend. Take care of yourself, OP. <3"

UnethicalLifeProTips,fdf6oqs,t1_fdf6f9c,1578354549.0,"Hilariously, that was our next statement. 

Our friends still brought beer. 

We've given up after the holidays. Mainly because we'd rather them drink beer and get buzzed than drink our liquor and get trashed."
UnethicalLifeProTips,fd6o42p,t3_ek4vfk,1578193669.0,"Pro-tip coming from a lady: 

1. Don't use the word *sinister* when saying you want to plan ways to get more women."
UnethicalLifeProTips,fd6nne3,t3_ejnt0h,1578193513.0,"So, mine and my roommates' house isn't a ""dry"" house by any means, we just don't really drink that much. 

But we're also the house the throws parties for our friend group. 

For every party, a handful of our friends will bring whatever beer they like at the time (usually some new belgium or IPA they've discovered.) But, after every party, said friends leave whatever beer is left at our house. 

Now, for a lot of houses, this would cool, because, free beer, right? 

Well, after six or so parties, we have an entire shelf in a cupboard and part of our fridge filled with beer we won't drink. We tell people, ""If you bring beer, take it with you."" 

They don't listen. 

We have SO MUCH BEER. 

My boyfriend and I are heading to the next state over for a big NYE party with our friends that live there. 

That part of the friend group DOES drink. 

So, my *selfless* and *benevolent* plan is: 

* Load up the metric stupid amount of beer in our house. 
* Bring to party.
* People rejoice that I bring an awesome smorgasbord of beer choices.
* Abandon beer at friends house. 
* Friends' problem now.  

It worked like a charm. 10/10 no regrets."

Even if I wanted kids, I know I wouldn't enjoy it, as much as I wish I would. 

I have a bunch of small chronic health issues that when stacked together mean I would miserable and sick for 90% of the pregnancy. No. No thank you. 

If you're one of the lucky ones that has a nice, smooth pregnancy, good for you. Don't judge me because I would spend mine sick, weak, and miserable."

When I was in college, the guy I was dating and I were coming back from a long road trip and decided, ""Fuck it, let's actually check this place out."" 

I was actually kind of disappointed. It was a pretty run of the mill sex shop. A bit small, but honestly not the worst."
