yesyesyesyesno,fgg448p,t1_fgg28sl,1580753834.0,"Yup, I use the small V groove notched trowel for most wall work.  And not being smart here but there is a difference in wall tile and floor tile, generally.  Many people are aware, some are not.

Most wall tile is made from much lighter recipe than porcelain or ceramic floor tiles are.  One year a customer bought his own tile and hired me to do the install, got the main room done and went into the bathroom to do the floor, guy had bought 8x8 wall tile.  Told him ""These are wall tiles, not made for floors.""  

Guy fricken argued with me for an hour and told me how the employees at (big box store) told him it was just fine for floors.  Well, color me stupid.  I put the fuckers down just to spite him.  Found out later from another buddy that the guy had to tear out all the tile and durock and start over.  Im still fucking laughing.

The custom stuff my buddies do is typically heavy stuff so they use a 1/4"" for walls too but those large or heavy tiles can sag BADLY on you if you arent careful.  Even cheap ass Menards tile will sag in the 12x12 size.  The way you fix that is to screws straight edges to the wall, at the bottom of your 2nd row up from the floor.  Then leave them there until the wall is complete and ready for grout.  Some walls we just grouted as it stood, waited a day then took the straight edges out and finished the bottom row.  Either way, its a good practice for heavy wall work.

Many guys will ""back butter"" their tiles, both floors and walls.  We never did for floors but did with some of the high dollar wall stuff, just a nice thin coat of thinset then set it aside to dry.  We used to do a lot of our back buttering at the end of the day so we had stuff ready for the morning."
yesyesyesyesno,fgg1yw2,t1_fgfugv8,1580752492.0,"Cheap tile will do that.

We used to open 3 boxes at once then shuffle all the tiles together in groups of 3 until the entire stack had been mixed.  Tile can be the same color and same design but if it was made in different batches it can vary a lot, up to an 1/8"" at times.  

Youre going to win and lose both on grout lines, good thing is once its grouted its hard to see unless its a massive difference.  At times you just have to dig for a smaller or larger square when shit starts getting squirrely."
yesyesyesyesno,fgg1lpj,t1_fgfxuyi,1580752262.0,"No, spread however it works for you but never spread too much at one time.  It takes practice to keep your rows from doubling over.  For floors I always used a 1/4"" notched trowel for 12x12 or 18x18 tiles."
