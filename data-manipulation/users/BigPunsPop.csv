fatlogic,ffjvfs8,t3_etyw1k,1580008039.0,"I try to give these posts the benefit of the doubt most of the time, and they’re right about maybe your height (and I get that we all have our own brand of metabolism that we work with) and general underlying frame but I mean? Such a defeatist sentiment to say “well I have no control over x and y body traits so I guess I shouldn’t try to treat my body kindly at all and instead shit on people who do” 

And I got a few friends that have that high BMI but I know are healthier than I am (at least at the moment) so this isn’t a dig on the idea that you can’t be healthy/athletic at a higher weight, just calling out the nonsensical idea that is propagated that from infancy people are predestined to obesity. Absolute horseshit. I don’t care what you eat or how you wanna live your life so stop making “taking care of your health” controversial ffs lmao

Edit: I don’t event wanna touch the co-opting of LGBT struggles in this post but I will say fuck that"
