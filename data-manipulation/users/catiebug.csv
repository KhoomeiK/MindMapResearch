His monologue about how ""every day there was some new technology"" is a pretty obvious signal that he is the closest possible thing to audience surrogate and was either a very young millennial or Gen Z. Without that, it's easy for most viewers to naturally identify with Matthew McConaughey instead. The boomers are def long gone by the events of Interstellar."
CrappyDesign,ffr9yd2,t1_ffqxep3,1580153657.0,"I'm more concerned about the blind person. Yeah, they can use their cane to tell where the sidewalk is. But if the design of the sidewalk is so bizarre and unusual, they're going to second-guess themselves and/or wonder if they've reached a point where two sidewalks cross, feel around for the other possible forks and lose their place. It seems so obvious to a sighted person, but really try to imagine navigating it entirely from feel and using common sense assumptions about how sidewalks are supposed to work."

BabyBumps,ffpswpc,t3_etobo7,1580104504.0,"Yes, I had them as early as 24 weeks with my son. Obviously I'm not a doctor, but it sure sounds like BH to me.

The OBs response, even if she was correct, was inappropriate. I hope you make a complaint of some kind. They can't be flippant about shit. If it's BH, it's nothing to worry about. If she *doesn't* think it's BH, then she damn well better look into what it is. Ridiculous behavior."

beyondthebump,ffk3ecx,t3_etrdkr,1580014582.0,"You won't offend the daycare, but just be prepared that it may not work anyway. Some symptoms linger *forever*. My son only goes to drop-in care once in awhile, but we've never gotten ""ahead"" of it. I make a concerted effort once in awhile to keep him away from daycare, playdates, church nursery, etc. He just gets sick again anyway, and we're both bored, miserable, stir-crazy and cooped up along the way.

I don't really have family who could offer what yours did, but I'm not sure I would take them up on it anyway. Germs are gonna happen. Maybe even at a family member's house. The benefits my son gets from even sporadic daycare is unbelievable. I figure the more he gets sick now, the less he'll be sick when he hits school (talk to pre-K and Kindergarten teachers... they can tell which kids were in daycare vs not, based on how often and how severely they get sick). I wish he wasn't sick all the time, but I've gotten used to it. 

Just my two cents. I could certainly understand if you decide to do it though!"
beyondthebump,ffjy0l8,t1_ffjbgsn,1580010071.0,"Not always an option, sometimes family cannot travel (OP followed up in a later comment). You're not wrong, but this advice can be unintentionally dismissive, because not everyone can tell disabled family to come to them."
beyondthebump,ffjxrsq,t3_eu084y,1580009877.0,"We have done bath every night since about 6 weeks (he's 1.5 now). Warm water, non-soap cleanser (like Cetaphil), and some lotion right before pajamas go on. Hair washing with baby shampoo (I think we use Aveeno) only once a week. One, because that's all that's really needed, but also because he absolutely hates water on his head.

Bath starts the routine. If we ever skip, it's because he's clearly super tired and doesn't need the entire routine to trigger sleep (usually nights when we come home late)."

Our coaches got a kick out of using a cheer where we said our names with all the same-names standing next to each other and me last. Looking back, it was borderline risky. Kids will get insecure about the craziest things. No reason to purposefully single one out. Lucky for them, I thought it was funny too. But I could very easily see it going bad."
holdmycosmo,ffee678,t1_ffe3ugb,1579844680.0,"Yeah, the Regional Presidents of the $4 billion company that I worked for flew Southwest exclusively between offices. Not only are they a good value, but they turn their flights around fast, which is nice for business travel (get to the airport with minimum amount of time, don't check anything). I know quite a few other people with laughable amounts of money that fly Southwest. Why deal with Delta and United's bullshit for a flight so short it barely even levels off at cruising altitude?"

beyondthebump,ffatns6,t3_es58e1,1579744230.0,"Think about your baby-wearing, if you plan to. I found the Boba/Moby wraps to be too warm in the summer. I didn't particularly like the style either. I had a hand-me-down standard Baby K'tan, but also found that pretty hot. So I ordered a Baby K'Tan Active. It's made out of breathable tech fabric and was so much more comfortable for both of us. For a buckle carrier, we got an off brand one on Amazon, but we made sure it had the vent you could open in the heat. All the brand names (Ergo, etc) have at least one model meant for warmer weather.

You won't have to buy sweaters or anything in infant sizes. If you go anywhere with cold A/C, they're still immobile enough to just use a blanket. Forgo the car seat cover. They are too hot. My baby never liked being covered up anyway. But they are dangerous. It's better to find or create some shade some way that won't make their car seat a sauna."

I'm sorry if that sounds harsh. I actually hope it gave you a chuckle or smirk. Because I think a part of you must already know it's really ok. A carpool for a third grader is hardly the point at which you ""gave up on parenting"". :-) It makes sense. I hope you can work something out! If it helps to remember, lots of doctors, lawyers, rocket scientists, social workers, astronauts, and [insert other inspiring figures here] rode the bus or a carpool to school.

It's a preventative though, so you gotta clear the rash with something zinc-based first. We used the Magic Stick at almost every diaper change until he got older, then just at nighttime. It has the consistency of Vaseline, but lighter and easier to apply. Bonus, it makes poops much easier to clean (they just wipe right off sometimes).

It's pricy though, but worth considering if you don't see improvement otherwise."
beyondthebump,ffapxym,t3_eshyjn,1579741744.0,"I do feel this. It's worse in the winter because the yard is no longer an option, but I do think it's ok to just let them explore. A few toys are good (we rotate them every week to keep them fresh). But yeah, a lot of days are just trying to keep him happy while cleaning up from a meal/snack, then killing time until the next meal/snack, rinse and repeat. 

Lately I have tried to make a habit of going somewhere every morning around 9:15. One day it's a toddler exercise class. Another it's a Mommy and Me group. The other days might be the gym (they have childcare and a great play area), the indoor playground, or grocery shopping. Either way, it kills most of the morning, we come back for lunch and nap, then just survive until dad gets home. Obviously we're down to one nap a day, but we did this at two naps too (with the outing being between naps).

I hated it because breastfeeding was already hard enough, then I'd get him latched and just want to kick my feet the whole time. It should get better! If it doesn't, it's worth talking to your doctor though. It might just be sleep and stress-related though. Why it's worse during nursing, I never figured out. Might just be how your body reacts to oxytocin."

By my best estimate I ate about the same amount extra that I did during pregnancy (about 300 calories a day, or the equivalent of an apple with peanut butter). I would occasionally have a crazy day where I ate everything in site, but I've always done that (just once in awhile). Otherwise, the hardest thing I think was the sugar cravings. I've always had them, but they were outrageous until I finally stopped pumping. I ate so much fruit to try and mitigate against the temptation to eat candy."

beyondthebump,ff6nhpc,t1_ff6alh7,1579630960.0,"My son cried for actual *hours* at the beginning of sleep training. The first few days each time (we had to do it twice due to an overseas move). He just had that much stamina. It was awful and of course, it was stressful. But he's fine and we're fine. 

Obviously, it's stressful for the baby. And you probably ran across the dubious study regarding how baby's cortisol (ie, stress) levels remain high after the crying period while mom's return to normal. Besides the fact that study doesn't pass rigor... of *course* they do! Mom understands what's happening and is awake, while baby doesn't understand and they're asleep. What they didn't test was what baby's cortisol levels look like after sleep training, when they no longer cry themselves to sleep. Why didn't they test that? Because it probably wouldn't have fit the results they were hoping to get (""sleep training bad""). I can tell you that my son goes to sleep on his own, happy. He's 19 months now and he waves goodbye and says ""night night"". And then he sleeps. All night. It's good for him, good for us, and it was worth the brief periods of crying to accomplish it. I wish we didn't have to, but we'd tried everything else already. That's all there was left."
