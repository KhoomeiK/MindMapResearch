Over the course of the next week, it gets progressively worse to the point where I wake up with such pain that I can't sleep.

explainlikeimfive,fds2dg3,t3_emq5ak,1578693245.0,"If you've got 10 minutes to spare, here's a discussion of the Winchester model 1897 which features a half-cock system.

https://youtu.be/FO343bBwmTs

The highlights include:

Half cock systems are a safety feature that allows the hammer to rest without contacting the firing pin. This is a safety feature since, for example, dropping the gun on the hammer could discharge the round in the chamber.

Half cock systems also avoid keeping the hammer spring compressed for excessive periods of time. Spring compression could damage the spring.

The big downside is that, for many older guns with this feature, the only way to put the hammer on half cock involves manually dropping the hammer on a loaded chamber by pulling the trigger while holding the hammer. If you slip, you just put a hole in something.

There's a particularly humorous demonstration of that phenomenon at 3:35 in the video. At least watch that if you don't want to see the whole thing.

Modern hammer fired guns with a half-cock option, such as the CZ-75D, can include a manual decocking lever which avoids that issue."
