asoiaf,ffaylmp,t1_ffaxbag,1579747499.0,"I think its worth examining further, but I don't have the books with me right now. Honestly, from what I remember the Ironbank did not metition it, and they should have sailed pass dragonstone. It seems super crucial if it did, since on paper its Stannis's capital. Jon Connington would have mentioned if did as well. 

There is the show as well- which I hestitate to use due to the nature of storytelling in the show, but it shows it unoccupied. No way would the Tyrells would leave it abandoned if they captured it."
worldnews,ffay3id,t1_ff9kuya,1579747170.0,"This whole comment is a massive misunderstanding of world affairs. 

China is still a great power- the media hypes them up but if you look at them from the lens of actual control, they are both far weaker then the EU and the US. 

Russia is a regional power. If Turkey and Poland kept their shit together, Russia would be lucky to be a middle power. 

India is a middle power. They can't even control their own territorial waters. 

The US is still the worlds sole super power, but that power is shrinking . We are like the British in 1929- at the top of the game but probably losing control- it would take one world crisis to sink us. 

The EU- the EU is a basketcase of issues, if it wasn't for the blind nationalism and the inability to fix the EU governing system, the EU would be a super power. Italy, Germany and Spain could all have Nuclear Weapons within 6 months if they started a program today. France has them. 

Ultimately, the world is a changing place, but its not moving as fast the media claims and more likely then not, we are moving towards a three power world, the EU, China, and the United States. The EU should be the one everyone is watching. Historically speaking 5 of the worlds great powers in the last century and 2 (3) super powers came from Europe (France has never been acknowledged as a super power, but they controlled 9 percent of the world and were the official trade language for 100 years as well as being the sole rival to the British Empire, I think historians do a huge disservice to the French as a whole.)"
asoiaf,ffawq2u,t1_ff7uu95,1579746261.0,Did the siege of Dragonstone actually happen? Stannis never hears of it- nor does the north. I always assumed that the Tyrells were using the siege to have Loras rescue Margery in an attempt
asoiaf,ffaw88z,t3_es762y,1579745930.0,"This is pushing the boundries of both characters. Littlefinger had a lot of pots, but his biggest concern was getting the Starks and Lannisters at war. He wasn't interested in Renly being king, because his plan would have been for naught. Renly would have made peace with the starks or would have crushed them in any conflict. The Martells didn't hate Renly, and might have in theory work with him. Everyone hated or had some animosity towards the Lannisters, and that was how Littlefinger was going to take the realm."
asoiaf,ffavgkc,t3_esh9pa,1579745423.0,"No, the wheel continues. See the small council at the end of it all. I suppose Davos doesn't have any TV show heirs, but if the books end with the same council, then we are looking at a similar situation leading up to the war of the 5 kings."

Whether Hitler understood this or not is up to debate, but he took advantage of it. Everyone was shortsighted. I would like to say everyone was an idiot in the 30's but thats unfair given that 15-20 years before a whole generation was lost. You have to remember that when judging the people in that period."

Both the soviets, the west, and the Nazi's knew that the ""alliance"" was a facade, however Stalin needed time to do... whatever he was going to do. Stalin was not a bright person- Hitler knew exactly what he was doing here- he was keeping the French from asking the USSR for help- not that the USSR was ready anyway. Of course, the French honestly should have beat Germany by themselves but that is something different. My point and hopefully his, is that Hitler had a vision and was going to stick to that vision, and that alliance was all about Germany setting the stage for the USSR and to isolate the French and British from any eastern support."

Skingrad^ 

There is actually one I forget to add and even a lot of veterans miss- There is an NPC in the imperial city that is former mages guild and can start a massive war between civs and guard- hit name is Ontun vanin. You lose 5 disposition for every rank you gain in the mages guild ending up at negative 50. He will attack you on sight- you can calm him or if you are an imperial you can use voice of the emperor, but you can get a lot of merchants killed by accident and end a few side quests."
ElderScrolls,fed8drz,t3_eogtpz,1579003515.0,"A few things- 

1. Do not travel to the southside of the map between in of ill omen and priory of the nine, there is an unmarked house that gets destroyed by an oblivion gate if you spawn it before you finish the main quest. 

2. Do the main quest last. Having all of your followers jump in at the battle of bruma is fun. 

3. Do not return martin to cloud ruler for a while- taking him on the knights of the nine and mages guild questlines saves you a lot of time since he will trigger a lot of enemies. 

4. Do not enter skingrad until you buy the house if you can. The seller of the house has a shot of committing accidental suicide by walking over a bridge and falling over the side, rendering the inability to buy the house. 

5. Followers can get bounties that they can't erase. This can lead to some pretty funny things, but martin can get bounties pretty easily. 

6. There are a few master trainers in the wild- they die pretty easily. Its not like you need them, but its just worth noting. Also the knights of the nine DLC can cause the restoration master trainer unable to train because both of the OG expert trainers die in the questline and their replacements do not have the proper dialogue to trigger the quest."

Build 10 of each building and set them to the following- Barracks- Light Light, heavy, Machine Light, scout. Tank factory- 2 heavy/1 light. Seige anti air. 
Sned all your allied ships to the side you want to attack with what I believe is command 22 in the chat box if playing with ai- should give your transports covered and create enough of a push and have them continue attacking that spot.

boxoffice,fcw0f9m,t1_fcvx4lr,1578014267.0,"That is the first two movies though. Make a graph by the years and yeah, it bounces back with TROS, but solo was plagued with problems and in a very hostile spot. Disney rushed this all out, and after reading inbetween the lines, its their fault and not Lucas films. At least that what it looks like. It seems like the mouse was trying to force deadlines on a company that needed to scratch everything from the old EU and go through plans and development. I am not saying anyone should hate Disney for this, but pause and consider if Disney would have given these movies sometime while cranking out rogue one, solo, and other character films. Probably would have worked out for the better while building hype."
boxoffice,fcvtaxl,t1_fcvskv5,1578009618.0,"I never meant financial, but instead of what could have been. Maybe, like the three combined should have grossed way higher- around 5.2-5.5 billion for the whole trilogy. This will probably scratch between 4.2-4.3 over all.  Fail is probably way to strong. I guess failed to meet expectations is better."
boxoffice,fcvrm1q,t1_fcvr8yr,1578008528.0,"I agree. This will be seen as  a future study for how to make a franchise fail, and people will see how marvel will exceed. Of course, it will be interesting to see studies for Jurassic Park, Harry Potter, the LOTR universe, and Pirates of the Caribbean universe from a box office perspective. None of those are Star Wars, nor have had the impact on a  social level, but all of those are still big films regardless.
