politics,ffwmv5t,t3_evgv37,1580305822.0,"I have an honest question. What happens when Bernie Sanders wins? For shits and giggles, what happens if the dems take the Senate? Let's say over the next 4 years there are great strides and achievements made towards balancing the scales back towards the benefit of the masses. They're able to make healthcare an affordable right. Corporations,  who are considered people, are held accountable. Wages for people increase. Higher education is available to those without crippling debt. It's won't be free (students need to have some skin in the game), but they wont be 22 with over $100k in debt. Let's say the American dream gets reignited and a true middle class begins to develop and thrive again. The idea of a government subsidized working poor becomes a horrible thing of the past. 

Now that we've made America great again, how do we curtail illegal immigration? This administration has done horrible things to people looking for an opportunity. Not even in my worst dreams can I imagine the things these poor people are trying to get away from, and the risks they take to get into the US. Even at the thought of having their family separated or worse, they still come. What happens if the country improves and becomes even more enticing?"

AskReddit,ffb4umi,t3_esi1iu,1579751838.0,"I worked at Sears in high school during the late 90s. I worked in the kids department. I noticed that were were more expensive for well known brand names. It might have been a marketing strategy to drive people to their store brand. Why spend $50 on a pair of Levi's when these Roebuck Jeans are $25? The problem was the store brand was often inferior in quality. Unlike Kirkland which offers great quality and value. 

Video games were located in the kids department. Our games were often $10+ than anywhere else. A Nintendo 64 game that was already 2 years old and had been marked down to $30 elsewhere were still $60. I felt the worst for those clueless grandmothers who shelled out top dollar for stuff like this. I couldn't convince them otherwise. We were always a couple weeks behind new releases. 

The rest of the store was pretty much the same. Not everyone wanted a Kenmore appliance. Best Buy had  more choices and better prices. Kohl's offered the same clothes and were always cheaper."

I dated a girl whose family owned a Cadillac dealer. They all drove demo units with dealer plates. They had a massive house and places at a ski resort. Then it all came crashing down. 

It turns out they were scamming GM with employee discount reimbursements. They were giving them out like candy to people who didn't qualify for them. I remember the older sister screaming that GM had no right to close them down. How could they shut down the 3rd largest volume dealer in the country with a very high Jewish population? 

It was very simple. Cadillac terminated their relationship with the family and gave it to another dealer network. They built a brand new building a few miles down the road."

todayilearned,fdhcegp,t3_elbma0,1578419871.0,"The art community is very exclusive. These paintings are certified authentic and they have a traceable history of who owned them. I remember watching 60 Minutes years back about a woman who bought an ugly painting as a joke to give to her friend for her birthday. 

A few years later they wanted to get rid of it at a yard sale when an art teacher mentioned it could be a Jackson Pollock. They had the painting looked over by an expert who was able to trace the paint back to Pollock's workshop. On top of that, they were able to match a fingerprint on the back of the painting to Pollock. 

These women were not people of means. A Pollock could easily sell for $50 million, and they considered throwing darts at it. Even with all the evidence confirming its authenticity, the art community turned its nose up because it wasn't certified and the trailer trash quality of its owners. Nobody would certify it either. There was one person who offered the woman $2 million. The offer was turned down. I'm willing to bet that person could get it certified and flip it for a healthy profit."
