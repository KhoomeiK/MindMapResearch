AskWomen,ffj9tgy,t3_etn8am,1579993797.0,"I'm a 5'10"" Latina... so I stand out cause I'm tall but I am also easy with a smile and eye contact but I speak fast and am sometimes loud (I don't mean to...we are just often loud). I didn't realize this was creating issues with making new friends until probably about 6 months ago when my husband said I was kind of ""alpha"" and when I got excited about something I would often talk over people (again.. I dont mean to). He said this might be off-putting or intimidating to women who feel like I am rude or it just makes it harder for us to ""click/bond"". Then I realized all my friends are very similar to me and the new friends I've made are also loud & confident. So I guess maybe there was some truth to that. I do feel really bad that I talk over people and I am trying not to.

On the height portion, I dk.  Do some women feel intimidated by that? I know it intimidates a good deal of men."

Especially when it is a place where you have a state as liberal as California and NY and then you have Alabama and Louisiana. Even within one state due to location or socioeconomic class you can have a whole host of people. In general Americans provide a lot of aid and donations. If I am not mistaken the country whose people provide the most donations is the US. I am not American,  but I live here for over a decade and it bothers me when people generalized knowing so little about a place."

He barks anytime my neighbor across the street pulls into his driveway (or the mail, amazon, garbage pickup). He gets random diarrhea from eating stuff he shouldn't and his poop has twice stained my white tile floor. About every 6 months I have to get sod to put down cause his nails eventually tear up the grass from walking through the middle in his preferred path. His hairs mean more maintenance to the AC as well. I love him, but he has cost me a LOT of money.  In my previous home he tore up the carpet in one spot and he also chewed on a door. My cavalier lets me know he wants to go out by scratching at the glass door, which is scratched to shit now. Just cause your dog isn't active and doesn't do much doesn't mean others don't. You don't want people to generalize dogs, yet you are generalizing actual humans..?"
WhitePeopleTwitter,few85tn,t1_fevroac,1579406751.0,"Toilet gets plugged? It's on the parent to pay to fix. Spill something? Just like if an adult spills: parents gotta clean it.  Draw something on a wall? Paint will fix that (landlords usually have to paint anyways between tenants) but most times that shit wipes off. A dog(or god forbid) your cat pisses on the wall and floor because they're sick or the owner is irresponsible? Costly for the landlord. Your dog scratches at the door when you're gone cause he has to go to the bathroom or has separation anxiety? Or chews on the corner of the wall because they're bored? I have had all of those things happen in my own house with different dogs in the last 15 years. I can without a doubt say a child causes much less issues cause my kid has so far to break/ruin any wall, door or carpet. He drew on a wall when he was 3 and I wiped it with a wet paper towel. That's  about it. I have to buy new grass every 6 or so months cause my shepherd rips at it from walking in the same path or cause he wants to hide his frisbee. My sliding glass door is scratched to shit cause that's how my little dog asks to go out. If someone rents they're not gonna usually buy new grass or replace a glass door. My shepherd also chewed on the floor molding once ""just cause"". He's  11 and had never done that before."
