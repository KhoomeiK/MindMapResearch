Yes, we have no way of knowing their full objective story, and I’m not taking what people say with any salt at all. In fact i’m doing the exact opposite and taking their word at face value precisely because of that, and any inferences I make about a poster’s behavior are directly based on what he/she says. Someone can post their facts, and I can look at those same facts as they are given (without questioning their veracity or accuracy), and come to a different conclusion, can I not?

Regarding the question of whether it is worth it to risk stroking the ego of random narcissists and causing a different set of problems, I contend there is no absolute right or wrong, but is up to individual value judgments. It is still useful for me to know for sure what other people think, and so I thank you for sharing."
SuicideWatch,feu3zon,t1_fetns2z,1579382916.0,"Separate comment because I want it to be clear that this is not specifically relating to this OP’s post. Some honest and non-rhetorical questions for you.

You talk about damage to people with low self esteem and feelings of being manipulative. Definitely possible, were that the case.

Consider a hypothetical selfish and mean asshole, who cares nothing about anyone else and always wants his way. When he finally meets someone with a backbone who refuses to give in to his unreasonable and completely selfish demands, he (sincerely) thinks himself the victim and he comes here seeking validation, misrepresenting others as unfair and needlessly picking on him.

Wouldn’t the wave of validation, and worse still, demonization of the other party, further entrench his shitty behavior, causing the problems to continue and worsen, except now he has a sense of sureness and smug moral superiority?

Wouldn’t it be better if he was able to change some small part of his behavior so how he is treated is, to some small extent, improved and his suffering reduced?

Or is it too great a risk for this subreddit, so the best course is to unconditionally support everyone’s view, right or wrong, and 100% refrain from challenging any of it?

In my view it will attract and retain the kind of people who only want attention and validation of their feelings regardless of suicidal tendencies. Do you feel this is a small, reasonable and necessary price to pay to avoid any risk of pushing someone to suicide?

This hypothetical guy is a complete asshat, but I understand there is a wide variation between the extremes. Once again, this is purely hypothetical and not talking about OP at all. I’d like to understand your thinking."

SuicideWatch,fetgrtj,t1_fet871a,1579375271.0,"At the risk of sounding stupid for responding to a purely sarcastic question, believe it or not I do have empathy.

I figured there would be enough people here lending unconditional support to OP. I know OP won’t listen and I’ll get downvoted by everyone who’s just here to say, “Omg they totally are jerks, fuck them. You’re completely faultless” to every single post here, but so be it. I just hope people who can step back and view things objectively can read this and say “Thank god it’s not just me.”

Not everybody who cries is in the right.

Not every parent who does what their child doesn’t like is abusive.

I don’t see that OP’s parents have done even a single thing that warrants the use of that exceedingly harsh, carelessly thrown around word.

SuicideWatch,fesb6qb,t3_eqg8kz,1579363415.0,"Eh I have to side with your parents about the coffee. 

And with no other examples given, I must consider the possibility that you actually do a lot of things ‘wrong’.

About the coffee, your parents have a point. It sounds like they’re trying to avoid the possibility of having to argue with the hotel if the hotel insisted on charging for the coffee, which is a valid concern. You seem to think that it’ll all be fine but that’s not a given. What you could’ve done instead was say, “oh yeah i didn’t think of that possibilty. Thanks, i’ll try to remember next time.”

To make things worse, after they pointed out that you weren’t as careful as they are, your response was to fight back, ie refuse to fix the possible problem. What was wrong with calling hotel service back about the coffee? In my opinion, when your parents insisted on calling back, and you insisted that there was no need, you sound like the less reasonable party. 

...why couldn’t you just call back and clear a potential misunderstanding? Why, given the choice between 1) making a phone call and 2) resisting/fighting with your parents, you chose the latter? Is it because you have social anxiety and don’t want to call the staff too many times? Is it because you want to stand up for yourself and not follow your parents orders, for a sense of control? Is it because you don’t want to admit that you could’ve done something better?

I have to reiterate that this is the only example I have to go on.

And since this is the one you chose to present, I assume this is one that puts you in the best light OR is somewhat representative of the other instances of fights between you and your parents. So far the picture it suggests doesn’t seem to support your side."
