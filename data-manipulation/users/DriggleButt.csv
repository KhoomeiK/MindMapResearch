And it's up to $6000 already? Surely this hasn't gone on for two-ish years, so the fine is going up by more than $100 a day.

You only earn about $45 dollars a day working minimum wage. How are the impoverished supposed to pay such fines? I'm not talking about your friend specifically, but unless she's been putting it off for four years, the fine raises faster than someone in poverty could hope to earn the money to pay the fine."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,fehehls,t1_fehadsk,1579114879.0,"Hey, I have a conflicting opinion, but I'm not presenting it as fact. Just letting you know.

Islam is a very misogynistic religion, much like Christianity (surprise, they have the same father), and he isn't wrong in suggesting that the outfit has some negative connotations, but I wouldn't go so far as to say it normalizes misogyny by wearing one.

The way I see it, it's like the n-word. It has a bad meaning when you look at the origin of it, but now-a-days it is empowering when used by the people that used to be oppressed by it.

If an Islamic woman *chooses* to wear a Hijab, by her own will, then so be it. If she is still being forced to wear it by her husband, or family, then I have to say I'm not happy with it. 

I'm atheist (oh fuck) and I don't believe that religion should have the power it does over people. ""Well, it's their religion."" isn't a valid excuse to infringe on another human's rights as an individual. 

I obviously don't know the full context for this woman's outfit, and whether it is her choice, or if she is forced, so I'm not making any claims in this particular situation. 

TL;DR: Forced hijab bad, chosen hijab okay. Religion bad. Downvotes to the left."

7 billion people are liars, all in on the conspiracy, and Trump is an innocent guy the world is ganging up on. That's rich. It boggles my mind how you guys manage to stay this separated from reality, even after Trump's been *impeached*. He was impeached. *Proven* guilty. And even then you won't accept that he's a bad guy, that he did something wrong, that he raped a 13 year old girl. No, it's definitely a conspiracy. The whole world is out to get him.

facepalm,fe3qhuu,t1_fe38xzp,1578851898.0,"It makes perfect sense if you're not a mouthbreather.

A person, regardless of the specifics of their body or mind, knowingly and falsely accuses someone else of a crime. That other person is innocent, but our justice system makes often mistakes. Sometimes they can rule to imprison an innocent person if they want to. Sometimes they can rule to let a guilty person go free.

So, this person is accusing someone of a crime falsely, and if the person they're accusing is ""proven"" guilty, then that person is sent to jail because of someone's false accusation.

It can take years to get the verdict reviewed and turned over. Decades in some unfortunate cases.

Why *shouldn't* the false accusation of a crime with a heavy penalty carry the same penalty in response? If you accuse someone of murder, or rape, they're potentially looking at a lifetime of punishment for a crime they didn't commit. Your words can put a black mark on an innocent person's record as a sex offender, or a murderer, *even* if they're proven innocent. People might recognize them when they pass by them on the street, ""Hey isn't that the person they were putting on trial for raping that one other person?""

It leaves a stain on those innocent people, *even* when they're proven innocent. If you're the kind of shit stain that goes around falsely accusing people of such heavy crimes with equally heavy consequences, you *should* be liable to receive the same consequences for falsely accusing someone of it. Otherwise, the risk doesn't match the potential ""reward"" of branding someone as a rapist/murderer/etc for life.

But, no, yeah, it's totally not fair. People that falsely accuse others of rape totally aren't ruining other people's lives."
