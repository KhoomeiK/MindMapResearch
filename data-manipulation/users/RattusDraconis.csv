He regularly pissed off his own older (now adult) daughters ""to get them fired up"" for no fucking reason other than to piss them off. The younger of the two fled his house with leaving to go live with a relative to finish off high school as her cover story. Both of them have effectively gone no contact with him. He brainwashed them into hating their mom; getting them to believe that she was so crazy she was a danger to them. Spoiler alert: She is not, she's a productive member of society, an active part of the community, and is in the process of getting her medical degree while working full time.

My mom ignored my brother and I for YEARS about this man, right from the get-go. She said we were being overly dramatic, or difficult, when we didn't want to go out to his house.

AskReddit,fczoiq2,t1_fczil4y,1578105724.0,"A friend of mine lived in Japan for several years, she still finds it weird how the US can't get on board with making sure you don't pass on your illness when out in public. The few times she did wear one at school, she was brutally bullied by kids AND staff. Like seriously, she wasn't sick enough to stay home by the standards set by the district, but because she was taking measures to not pass it on to anyone else she was being ""weird"". 

Eventually face masks of ANY kind were ruled by the school (not the district) as unacceptable and a distraction to the learning environment, including for medical purposes if there was no direct note from a doctor."

Jackasses who think they can park wherever they want, throwing a fit when asked to move out of someone's spot, refusing to tip because they or their spouse's service is tip enough, taking stuff out of people's carts at the store, etc. Thankfully it's only some of them, but oh my god, the ones who think you should drop down to their feet because they signed up to serve grind my gears."

TheKingofRandom,fcoxwiz,t3_ei8qgy,1577844618.0,It's like the rubber egg experiment kids do in science fairs. The vinegar dissolves the calcium that's present in both eggshells and bones. It's an established at home experiment.
gaming,fcmiacc,t1_fcld128,1577776371.0,"I got into it because of one guy who I stuck around with through a couple of server swaps. Now he runs/owns a server cluster he inherited from the original owner because he enjoyed playing with everyone too much to just let it all die. Ark is his way of enjoying social time with others, especially since he's a truck driver.

He spent enoguh time on official servers to where the whole pillar thing is an extreme pet peeve of his. Since he's admin he destroys them when he sees them. The rule is if you're going to build, then fucking build. Don't claim shit and then leave for a few weeks while everyone is scrambling to find their own spots that suit their purposes"
