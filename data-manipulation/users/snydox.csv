Long Story short, most of the English vocabulary and writing come from the Normans. A ""Viking"" tribe from France that conquered England a long time ago.

I'm currently studying French and the one thing that frustrates me the most is that there are a bunch of letters in French words that are silent. 

Example: Montreal is pronounced ""Moreal"", and most consonants at the end of any word are silent.

So French word: Couleur was simplified to Colour in English, and the Americans simplified even more to just color. 

To be fair, In French, English, and Spanish, colour is simply pronounced as color. However, I like to follow rules, and if the British Council decides to simplify their vocabulary and embrace American grammar, I will embrace it as well. But until then, I cannot let the anarchy to rule."

There are many regional dialects of English, like British, Canadian, Australian, New Zelander, Caribbean, and the American aberration.

However, even though they sound different: the CANZUK countries follow nearly the same grammar. 

I live in Canada and I sound like a North American. However, when it comes to my writing, I follow the grammar rules preestablished by the British Council.

Examples:

It's Colour, not Color
It's Labour, not Labor
It's Theatre, not Theater
It's Centre, not Center
It's Learnt, not learned
It's Licence, not License

And the letter Z is pronounced Zed, not Zee.
