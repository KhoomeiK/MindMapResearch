I think this is how grad students can take classes even when they don't meet pre reqs"

Anxiety,fdfhk09,t3_el2581,1578361850.0,"congrats! Your school most likely has an office of 'disability' or something like that. I highly recommend you contact them to see how they can help you. If you have a condition like anxiety, they can help you with exam accommodations which you will be SO glad you have. You'd be surprised of how many people have double time for exam accommodations."
depression,fdcps7c,t3_ekluv2,1578280982.0,I wish you the best chewie
depression,fdcpigo,t1_fdcnxxi,1578280782.0,"I hear you. I took an intro to java and it was enough for me to not do CS. You are in the depression sub so I assume you suffer from it? I do agree there are so many wrong things with college. starting with how expensive it is, I can't even afford it! I guess, take it one step at a time dude. Im not gonna tell you to look at the positive because that doesn't help. If you have some time, maybe listen to some audio books. One I like is on the shortness of life by seneca (on youtube). Meditations by Marcus aurelius is also good. They give a different point of view in life. BTW I didn't downvote you."

might be too late but if you can and want to, just take it at slcc. physics classes at the u are a shit show.."

Edit: unfortunately, these are the things non-white people have to go through which sucks ass. As a non-white dude, I can DEFINITELY relate to this which is fucking unfair. It is tough to know which is going to fuck you over the least. Maybe try both ways. I usually hide both questions with 'declined' or I have even checked that I am white (figured that my goal is for my application to get past the initial step lol)..
As a side note, this is a very good example of white privilege. The privilege of not having to worry about this extra step.."
EngineeringStudents,fcwqlk2,t1_fcwppww,1578033758.0,"No they will teach you. but at the same time you might want to take a class  in high school related to programming if you want to.

For both majors (ECE), it's always good to get started in high school by taking classes like: Physics, some coding class, electronics 1 and electronics 2. In the last two  classes they will teach you stuff that we start learning in our prerequisite classes: truth tables, logic gates (really fun), binary number system (also fun), and more. In fact, take at least electronics 1 lol.

You might want to also get involved in a student club. See if there is a robotics club in your high school. That will look really good on your application and scholarships.

Take as much math as you can including a probability class (all ECE majors must take a probability for engineers class).

I know math is taught horribly in high school and half teachers in high school are lazy assholes. If you struggle in a class like in math, coding of physics, don't get discouraged thinking engineering is not for you. It is just those lazy teachers who don't know how to teach. Hope that helps."
EngineeringStudents,fcwlv53,t1_fcvu8aj,1578029274.0,"IDK about CEs but as an EE, we do get to take classes related to "" sensors and actuators, hardware interfacing, and embedded software in depth""I think both majors get to study these things. As an EE, I am planning on specializing on sensors."
EngineeringStudents,fcwlayg,t3_ej5pua,1578028801.0,"EE and CE have very similar classes. If you are way more into coding, do CE, if you like coding but want exposure to more than coding, do EE.  EEs still get to do coding but a bit less. In the end, both CEs and EEs tend to work doing the same thing once graduating. For now you don't even have to pick one out yet lol. Some people start taking pre requisite classes that are required for both, hence the name: electrical and computer engineering.  
Once you take those pre-reqs, then you can pick out what to study and even after you do so, you still have a bit of time to change your mind lol 

Source, I am an EE senior undergrad."
EngineeringStudents,fcwknqq,t3_ej0sbx,1578028257.0,"as someone who qualifies for accommodations based on anxiety, I choose not to disclose this information. I have had horrible times sometimes whenever i disclosed it. You can always apply for accommodations after you get the job. They can not say no. and if they fire you, it will be easier to prove it was retaliation which is seriously illegal.

if you disclose this information when you apply, you will have a hard time proving that you were discriminated and not given the job because of this. Of course it is illegal to discriminate when you apply, but the problem is sadly, there are higher probabilities that the employer will skip your application due to biases, stereotypes, having to pay more money if you get accommodated.   
IDK why I get downvoted even when I have had direct experience on this..."
EngineeringStudents,fcwhtwq,t1_fcrx4bt,1578026005.0,"Update: thanks for the advice. I contacted 2 people. one was a recent grad engineer who added me and was friendly. The other is some kind of project manager. She actually replied telling me to look at job openings AND if i had questions, to contact such and such (she gave me the other person's email too). So I plan on emailing that other person soon lol."
EngineeringStudents,fcwhf69,t1_fcwh5gf,1578025700.0,"as someone with experience on ADA, you do NOT want to give the employer any reason to skip your application. The number of people who get discriminated is actually higher for people who disclose this information. Also, something to keep in mind, you can always keep it to yourself when you apply. You can then apply for accommodations AFTER you get the job. It is totally legal to do so and companies can not fire you after this because it'll be retaliation which is easier to prove than trying to prove that your application was skipped due to your disability status.."
EngineeringStudents,fcwgnj4,t1_fcvel1x,1578025133.0,false. it is the opposite. they don't want to deal with extra accommodations because that means extra money spent.
EngineeringStudents,fcth7rs,t3_eilt0x,1577943180.0,"well don't worry because starting the semester, your classes will give it to you nice and hard..."
EngineeringStudents,fctgrgn,t1_fcsz4hp,1577942760.0,"in a way i disagree a bit with this. as an EE, I HATED physics 1 and 2. reason being, TAs don't give a shit about you and you are just a number. I did horrible in physics 2. I'm not doing bad on EE courses and things get a lot more interesting later on.  I have known other EEs with same experience."
EngineeringStudents,fcphnl7,t1_fcphekn,1577864512.0,hell yea. I just sent a message to this recruiter for a company I am being ignored through their online system. I hope she doesn't think it is weird for me to send a message at midnight. lol

EngineeringStudents,fcmn0x0,t1_fcm0gpn,1577782312.0,what is the min GPA in your eng program? mine is 2.5...
EngineeringStudents,fcj3xrh,t1_fccsn50,1577676664.0,"I think it depends on who teaches the class and not all jr/sr classes are tough. I have taken senior level courses that are so easy, you are almost guaranteed an A or B if you make effort. I have taken a grad level course that I got a B+ on and it was the easiest course I took so far. I'd say continue, OP. Get some counseling going and see if you qualify for accommodations. You'd be surprised by the # of students who have exam accommodations."
EngineeringStudents,fcj2bxa,t1_fcirjdq,1577675528.0,so...is your boss hiring interns? lol
EngineeringStudents,fcj23bo,t3_eheg5w,1577675357.0,"I have known lots of BMEs. Many of them are in:grad school, dental school, med school, private industry. If you plan on continuing with school, then do a BME. If you want to find a job right away, the few industries you might get a job are in medical devices.I was going to do a BME but switched to an EE for other reasons. I took 2 biology courses,  and 3 semesters of chemistry. Funny thing is that as I am finishing my EE degree, I am realizing that I can still do stuff related to biology in private industry w/o a BME. EEs can work almost anywhere lol. The EE program also offers classes that are 'interdisciplinary. For example, I took a class called biomedical micro devices where I learned how to create micro chips for cells, DNA, RNA, and other microscopic biological samples.

A friend of mine (a BME) major kept telling me she regretted not having switched to EE also. So I am not trying to convince you to switch to EE but I do want you to know that by taking just a few classes related to biology and chemistry while majoring in something else like EE, chem E, or ME, you can probably have MUCH better chances of working for a company that deals with biology like a medical device company. Another friend of mine who works for a medical device company also BME major said to me that his job is always hiring MEs.

To be honest, majoring in BME is risky and you don't learn as much as an EE IMO. As an EE, I have learned a SHIT ton of stuff I could apply for Biology related stuff (like the micro chip).  Anyway, my opinion is biased but I can tell you I am very happy I am doing an EE and I feel very good knowing I will have a chance to work in almost anywhere I choose.."
uofu,fcaaafh,t3_egu28u,1577565543.0,if this bioethics is the one from the engineering dept. then they give you all the readings on pdf. that class was OK just SO much reading and you have to pay attention to little details..

uofu,fc6sn3c,t1_fc6oick,1577488459.0,"This is out of control lol (obvious sarcasm). Not sure why I get downvoted for giving advice. It's not like it's inaccurate. oh well. OP should contact the dean ASAP. I have relied and trusted too much on admin fixing and taking care of their fuck ups. It almost costed me: getting dismissed from my program, and the latest one the secretary forgetting to send my loan application documents (almost costed me $100+ in late fees)."

EngineeringStudents,fc4wag9,t1_fc490j2,1577431060.0,"I wouldn't diagnose anyone but I do get your point. Seeking support is one step. I hope OP seeks counseling at school.   
I can relate to a lot of what OP said except being the 'shit' considering my grades are not the best (not due for the lack of trying though). Engineering courses sometimes expect a lot from you and it can burn you out fast. One thing I try to keep in mind is that once I gain knowledge, I will be able to CREATE SHIT and use my creative juices."
