Whatcouldgowrong,ff3g23b,t3_eqtyez,1579540308.0,That poor woman. She obviously needs the help mental health professionals. Things like this make me so sad. From the outside I can see how some people may find it funny but I can't imagine being in that poor woman's shoes.
sports,fespfgz,t3_eqga3r,1579367623.0,Definitely did better than I'd do.
AskReddit,fesohmv,t1_fepvi4j,1579367423.0,Did it heal completely? That seems like something that would cause pain for th rest of your life.
AnimalsBeingDerps,fepyclt,t3_eqaudi,1579334523.0,The connection those two share is so adorable. I have always wanted a cat and dog just like these.
IdiotsInCars,fepxv7j,t3_eq99y6,1579334377.0,I bet the car that caused it just kept going like nothing happened. Probably didn't even watch to make sure they were OK.
HumansBeingBros,fepxp3b,t3_eq6fcn,1579334251.0,"Well I hate to step down from being the self proclaimed best bartender ever but I will say you definitely have me with that hero move. I've saved people's food, drinks, and even a relationship or two while bartending. Never saved anyone's life. Great job man."
politics,fepv2iz,t3_eq7k20,1579332343.0,Why should we require the schools to feed kids the types of foods that just might keep them somewhat healthy? Obviously the parents should have to pay for healthy meals from home since all parents have money to spare.
millionairemakers,fepuqi3,t3_eq81a8,1579331995.0,Good luck everyone! Happy 2020!
AskReddit,fepun5l,t1_feprgd6,1579331909.0,OMG that had to have been excruciating.
AskReddit,fephaph,t1_fep2brn,1579320478.0,I am so sorry for what you went through. I have been in some pretty abusive relationships but what you went through really shows how lucky I was to have gotten away before things went that bad. You deserve better. Keep up with your therapy. I have severe ptsd from the military and can tell you that slowly it can get better. It's a long treacherous road but in time you do begin to heal.
AskReddit,fepelrd,t1_fep1iog,1579318583.0,Hope you are doing better now!
AskReddit,fep0w4y,t1_feoozou,1579309656.0,I feel like there could be more of a description on this response.
AskReddit,fep0tqy,t1_feopccx,1579309613.0,As a mom the fact that you thought about never seeing your mom again made me extremely sad.
AskReddit,fep0qrs,t1_feopsy5,1579309561.0,My stomach turned just reading this.
AskReddit,fep0nhy,t1_feor5wi,1579309503.0,How long has it been? Do you still worry all the time?

AskReddit,feoalyk,t3_epp36x,1579297375.0,Membership at a better gym. Maybe one of those programs that does your meal prep for you. Better workout clothes and shoes. My hobby is getting into the best shape of my life. I've done an amazing job losing almost 100 lbs but then I started a job where I work 60 hours a week and I haven't kept up with it. I miss it a lot and my hours are much more normal now.
AskReddit,feo6f33,t3_eq1wzh,1579295785.0,Finding a nice rental home so that my future husband and I can provide a beautiful home for my two children and start our new life together. Finding the right rental is the only thing getting in the way. We may have found one but another application is pending and I hate to hope someone else doesn't get approved. My boyfriends standards for a home aren't easy to meet so finding the perfect place again may take months and this place is perfect. I've spent months waiting for outside things to get out of the way of us finally taking this step. We are finally there. We have to find a rental and move out of my place in the next week. A house is literally the only thing standing in the way of our happiness. You can probably tell by how I keep rambling and repeating myself how badly I want this to happen now.
aww,femys47,t3_epyj0v,1579273056.0,The way the child gets scared and backs away is so sweet. What an adorable moment.
aww,fek3d3i,t1_fejbe8g,1579191745.0,"Don't be, seriously. My aunt got the child she had wanted for so long because of it. Sometimes good things happen for the worst reasons. It took me a very long time to see it but I wouldn't change it now."
aww,feiuag3,t1_feguc5f,1579147395.0,Honestly I don't plan to let her know exactly what happened. I'd prefer she think I was an irresponsible teenager rather than that she was the result of an attack. I've heard of children in her shoes feeling responsible for what happened to their mother and I couldn't possibly make her feel that way. The circumstances may have been horrendous but she was an angel in my life. I wouldn't want her ever thinking otherwise.
aww,fegpgbi,t1_feeg44n,1579099426.0,"She does. We don't see each other as I live across the country and it's very hard on me to see her. She looks just like her father and it brings back some pretty terrifying memories for me. I always fear she would think I resent her if she was able to see the pain in my eyes when I saw her. That being said, I think at this point distance is best but I'll always love her and be there for her if she needs me."
aww,fegp52y,t1_feemoap,1579099208.0,Thank you. I've never regretted the choice. She an amazing little girl and my aunt gave her a loving family.
aww,fee7nif,t3_eonffw,1579028083.0,"I had a daughter when I was barely 17 out of a horrible situation that I couldn't care for on my own.  My friends and foster family tried to convince me to have an abortion but I never considered it. It wasn't the right choice for me. I couldn't be happier with that choice because 3 months after I gave birth my aunt adopted her. I tried hard to take care of her on my own but it just wasn't possible. My aunt explains by telling my daughter that she could have had another baby on her own but she ""chose"" my daughter instead. I think that is a beautiful way to tell a child just how special they are. Out of every baby in the world my aunt chose her because she was so special. My daughter is loved and appreciated and one of the best things to ever happen in my life. Adoption is such a beautiful thing.

Congratulations to you both."

He just couldn't stay clean though. Even when he knew it would cost him our relationship. He used again the day before Thanksgiving. Then he left town and still hasn't been back. I spent the last month crying and feeling like I wasn't enough for him. I know that's not the case but I can't help but feel it. Christmas was very hard. We talk a lot on the phone but I spent most of Christmas reminding myself that I can't go back."
