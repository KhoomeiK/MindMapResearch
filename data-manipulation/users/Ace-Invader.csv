pokemon,ff0a23k,t3_er0lzj,1579466790.0,Bad ass!! Love it. Are you the same TigerLillie from youtube??
nosurf,ff09mip,t1_ff07mzc,1579466644.0,"That is fair! Crafting definitely isn't for everyone. My husband does HEMA, that could definitely be something to check out."
nosurf,ff04d93,t3_er14uv,1579465075.0,"Sounds like you're doing great so far! Are there any charities or anything you're interested in? Animal shelter, hospitals, big brother/little brother? This could help take up time and look good on a resume? 

Or depending on what you're in school for you could look into internships? Alternatively maybe pick up doing puzzles, legos, or even a solid craft like sculpting, woodwork, candle making?"
bulletjournal,fdt055o,t3_emznpt,1578710207.0,Dude this is sooo cute. I love the style. Would love to see more!
bulletjournal,fdszyoj,t3_emzu9o,1578710136.0,I don't know much about skating but you could also write reviews on certain parts you've used. Or maybe make a spreadsheet comparing prices from shops/ ot specs of different parts like wheels or what have yoy
bulletjournal,fdp15g3,t3_eg6j0h,1578617529.0,My tentative plan is based off a pinterest spread I found with paper airplanes and a pretty sunset in the back ground! Been wanting to do an origami spread
pokemon,fdnjlnu,t1_fdnese4,1578587171.0,"Wonder how r/PokemonSwordandShield looks right now. I saw an article on this and got excited, came to reddit looking for more details and was met with negativity. Apparently my opinion was unpopular."
pokemon,fdnirn5,t1_fdng7s0,1578586673.0,"Yeah agreed. Like I get before you could get the sequel and have the game and bonuses, but its not any cheaper for the people who bought the game first and don't want to replay it just to get to the bonus content."
pokemon,fdne5yl,t3_emb5uq,1578583883.0,"I for one am super amped that they're going in this direction. I would rather pay 30 for more content, (especially when its actually new content and not just aesthetics) than them create a second game years later"
bulletjournal,fd027uq,t3_ej7p3m,1578112556.0,I love this!!! You should post in the r/spyro subreddit!
bulletjournal,fcm5i40,t3_ehucaa,1577764760.0,This is so playful and so well drawn!
bulletjournal,fcm59zb,t3_ehxeen,1577764593.0,I love your color scheme so much!!!
loseit,fcm558v,t3_ehwykc,1577764497.0,"I don't know you or the exact reasons you're being advised to stop, but keep this in mind; the tracking is not why you're losing weight. You'll lose it because of what you are eating. I assume you've been tracking long enough to know how much you should portion, just stick to the same diet, and I'm sure you will lose. Not tracking does not mean you have to be unaware of how many calories something has or the nutritional info. 

Try it for a few weeks, if its not working its not like you cant start it up again. (Presumably after a discussion with therapist and yourself)"
bulletjournal,fca8utj,t3_egpm4v,1577564856.0,"Just picked up the Secondary Palette of Tombows from Michaels! (plus a few colors to supplement). With their 20% online order deal I got the pack for 12 dollars!   


As well as for anyone looking for Crayola Supertips, Walmart has the 100 pack on sale for $10!"
ABA,fca8lky,t3_egsjl8,1577564731.0,"I'm an RBT and have been in ABA for whats going to be 3 years now! I actually just switched my undergrad major to communication disorders because from working in ABA I learned language acquisition is a passion of mine! I still plan on becoming a BCBA, but I also want to look into getting my SLPA and eventually have dual certs SLP/BCBA.   


You should join the facebook group:  Speech Pathology - Applied Behavior Analysis Special Interest Group. You'll get a lot of good responses about ABA here but if you want a true comparison you might find more luck asking there!  


Side note: I'm also willing to answer any questions about my experiences in ABA!"
bulletjournal,fc6i6fs,t3_eg96t4,1577481157.0,I use the same layout for mine! I don't have them all yet though. I like that you did the ones at the top for the black/gray etc.
