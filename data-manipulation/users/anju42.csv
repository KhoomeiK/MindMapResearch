Before this last Christmas, we noticed a leak in our bathroom so we called emergency maintenance and shut off the water to the toilet and cleaned up the water. While maintenance was on their way we notice it was still leaking but it was coming from the wall. It turned out the guy in the next apartment had a pipe burst or something and didn't call anyone (the office was open during this time too) or turn off his water. His entire apartment was flooded for two days before it came into ours. And he thought it would be another few days at least before anyone saw his request form because of the holidays."

AdviceAnimals,ffgs732,t1_ffgq657,1579913706.0,The person abusing it should just get fired. Problem solved. Then we can al have this system.
AdviceAnimals,ffgrwpw,t1_fffcfu6,1579913497.0,I call in sick for mental health days. They don't ask you about it where I work because most people hate it here. (I'm also generally a physically sickly person though so maybe I get away with it well).
AdviceAnimals,ffgrgz9,t1_ffgbp9u,1579913183.0,Healthcare companies (in the US) are also notorious for providing the worst healthcare plans. They don't want to pay for insurance for people who might know how to use it properly.
AdviceAnimals,ffgrbex,t1_fffaosy,1579913071.0,My work has this system too but my managers excuse our sick days so we don't get points. The other managers require a doctor's note which is technically the rule here. If we don't use vacation though we have to make up the time.

facepalm,ffddacf,t1_ffbyyeg,1579818460.0,My grandma started her career as a secretary and she said if her meeting notes were what was what was said in the meeting her boss would be dissatisfied so one day she only wrote down peoples names and what they looked like and her boss was really happy with her notes. So going forward she kept personal details and names and physical descriptions in her notes.
japanese,ffdcssg,t3_et03nn,1579818155.0,That looks awesome! I'm usually kind of intimidated by reading japanese. Where did you find it?

n64,fend22b,t3_epsk9r,1579282087.0,"When I played this game as a little kid, there was this part where you could wall jump to get to an area with a star. My sister and I didn't want to try so my uncle lied and said Luigi was up there. I probably spent about 10 to 15 hours trying to figure out how to wall jump and I was disappointed when I discovered I had been lied to but happy I got up there. I don't remember for sure what was actually there though."
Career_Advice,fen3w66,t1_fekzb6f,1579276402.0,No problem :) I have a friend who cleans labs between experiments. It's kind of sucky because she has to be on her hands and knees a lot but something like that would probably be easy to find quickly depending on what's in your city.
mildlyinfuriating,fel6o9y,t3_epnyf8,1579215211.0,This is how we get anti-flouride and antivax people. The anti insulin movement is probably coming next.
supplychain,fekwboq,t1_fe3bfxg,1579208942.0,You should consider a double major. It's hard to fully grasp whether you like a job until you've tried it so your options will be more open. You should also do an internship in one or both of those areas. Internships are the easiest way to get a job after college and the easiest way to try out a career. (Paid internships though--many areas such as the US don't allow you to do actual work if you're not paid).
supplychain,fekvjon,t1_fe3i4ht,1579208480.0,"I'm having the opposite problem. I've been trying to get into supply chain for a few years but recruiters are telling me my degree isn't specific enough (I can't do the job because I ""don't know all the equations""). My degree is Applied Math and Computer Science (that's one combined major, not two) with Business Management concentration. So now I'm developing internal ERP software/automated processes and I just decided one day that I am in charge of all programs related to inventory/supply chain. Hopefully that will help me make the switch over to supply chain."
wholesomememes,fej3ro7,t3_epbi07,1579155801.0,I immediately thought of James and his Magikarp he bought on the fake titanic.

facepalm,fej3gn2,t1_feihb4k,1579155472.0,I thought flat earth people were joking but in that bad way where you can't tell they're being sarcastic.

Career_Advice,feie9qu,t3_enq8lh,1579136484.0,What was the job you loved? Maybe there's something similar to that you could switch to. Your education makes me think you could be an assistant in a lab next maybe (and then get promoted). Your experience with animals makes me think vet tech. Do you want to be in an office or outdoors?
facepalm,fegojbs,t3_ep044k,1579098778.0,"Once I got a new car (new as in only 15 years old) and decided to park next to the light pole and away from all the other cars at work to protect it from being hit. Naturally, a similar thing happened and someone hit the part of my car closest to the light pole."
mildlyinfuriating,fefcvhb,t1_fef1uqw,1579053579.0,I second the mannequin plan. Cardboard people are also an option if they're easier to get.

therewasanattempt,fe2oui0,t3_enlup8,1578841317.0,One time my whole family went shopping. My uncle bought some video games and the rest of us went to Shopko (RIP) while my uncle put his stuff in the car. When we left he realized he had put his stuff in the wrong car.
