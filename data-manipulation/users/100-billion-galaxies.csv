We were the only constant in her life. Eventually, they asked us if we could find a home for her because their lifestyle was just not suited for a dog. We found a family friend who loves her and she is perfect for that family. She’s been with them for 6 years now. Every time I come over (which is not very often) she freaks out excitedly. The owners say she doesn’t get as excited for anyone else but me and my brother. It’s good to know we still have her love after all this time."

DogAdvice,ffb7vul,t3_esli6n,1579754370.0,"I cannot stress this enough, huskies need a job. They can't just live a normal life like Labs can do. Labs are loveable and sweet, but they're also a little dumb. Huskies are smarter. They not only need their physical energy looked after, but their mental energy as well. I know she's a mix, but it sounds like the husky is really strong in her. She needs intense training. Like all day every day for a couple weeks. Teach her tricks like sit, stay, etc if you haven't, but also just work with her so she doesn't get bored and resort to destroying couches. Take her on a lot of walks and train her to walk behind you, don't let her pull on the leash. Really establish you are the alpha with constant reinforcement. If she pulls ahead of you, stop and make her sit. Eventually, she'll realize she can move forward if she stops pulling and walking ahead of you. Stop every few steps and make her sit. She'll have to concentrate really hard to anticipate what you want her to do. Tiring out her mind is just as important as tiring her out physically. Also, if she doesn't have space to just run and let loose that wild energy, she needs it. Another way to exercise her mind is puzzle toys. Also, play hide and seek with treats. She can learn to find them with her nose. If you really want to train her, train her to recognize the names of all the toys, maybe of the people in your family, and other words that are easy enough to distinguish for a dog. The main thing is to keep her busy physically and mentally. If you're gone for long amounts of time, consider kenneling her at home or bringing her to a doggie daycare to let out energy. Huskies are typically much more work than labs, even though there are still some crazy labs out there. I've worked at a dog daycare for 7.5 years now, I've seen some things."

All He sees are round coins, so we’ve been marred by our sin. It doesn’t matter how much or how little, we have still sinned. God created the universe, and that means He is judge over it. Every sin, no matter how big or how small, is a direct rebellion against Him. And that hurts Him. He explicitly says “the wages of sin is death”. It doesn’t matter what sin it is, all sin is sin.
