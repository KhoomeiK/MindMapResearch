Don’t be obtuse, prison sentences are obviously a lot less final that death, that was the point...

And no we can’t go back in time, but it gives the opportunity for new evidence to be found / another suspect to be arrested. If you’re dead, the new evidence is useless. If you’re in prison, you can still be saved.

The fact is that investigators/policemen/judges/lawyers are humans and that humans make mistakes . Errors in investigation / in court will always be made. Sometimes it’s not even anyone’s fault.

With mistakes being bound to happen... the death penalty is simply a bad idea.  

Also, I have to say that your argument « wrongfully convicted people who are released after 50 years in prison have nothing in their life, killing them  is a mercy » is absolutely ridiculous. Firstly because that’s an extreme case that pretty much never happens, secondly and more importantly because killing them is final while prison is not. And It’s not like they have a choice in the matter, they just get killed and that’s it... executing someone is definitely not « a more humane thing to do » than prison."

I personally think Charlie Parker is also a great way to get into Jazz. One-of-a-kind style that you always recognize in the first few seconds of any track, lots of jazz standards that you can later recognise when other people play them, rather short tracks that new jazz listeners won’t get « bored » in the middle of, and some very easy-listening jazz in general - but still incredibly subtle."

Basically comes down to education (in the sense of socialisation, I’m not trying to be rude), with listening to jazz being strongly correlated with being from a wealthy or intellectual background (not that it’s necessarily my case, it’s just how it is in general). It’s sort of an acquired taste in a way, or at least it was for me.
