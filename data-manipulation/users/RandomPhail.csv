I know being straightforward isn’t the way to convince people of things, but I don’t have time to write a full persuasive-essay right now, so be self-aware of your human-psychology real quick and just pretend I used a bunch of nice, agreeable words first to coax you onto my side and avoid making you upset to where you’d shutdown and refuse to keep an open-mind. Here’s the straight-forwardness some people need to hear:

Learn to look at things more objectively, and broaden your horizons with knowledge of *actual* bad games, because bns is not as bad as the community makes it seem, and it’s especially not as bad when you know about far worse, sometimes greedier, yet more popular games like: 
- the majority of COD milkings
- that one starwars game with the ludicrous loot boxes
- train simulator
- Fallout 76
- whatever happened with Mass Effect 3
- Firewatch (which had very sexist and rude devs who apparently wouldn’t listen to any feedback from males... I might be remembering the feedback part wrong tho.)
- the constant WWE/FIFA releases
- Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 5
- No Man’s Sky (at first. Now it’s better)
- Elder Scrolls Online (which I heard had bad support?)
- I’m sure there’s many many more

You guys have got to stop tricking yourselves into thinking (or pretending/memeing) that bns is the be-all end-all of poor quality and bad communication, because it’s objectively *not* (not by a fairly long-ass shot), and you’re not just hurting the game by saying it is, but you’re unhealthily lying to yourselves. 

And I don’t know what OP here said originally in their support ticket, but I can bet if it was rude, that’s why they got ignored. Whoever is back there reading these support tickets is probably not the figurehead of the company; They’re just some dudes. Distance yourselves emotionally from everything, and try to just state in respectful, easily-understandable terms what you truly think is incorrect in situations like this.

Because OP’s experience in this story *is* shitty, and it clearly seems like an example of bad customer-support… but this isn’t ALWAYS what support is like (as this post would seemingly like to imply), and in my experience, the support team has been professional, patient, and nice in the past (but, then again, I haven’t messaged them since the Dev teams switched, so maybe I’m wrong there).

Either way, my point still stands: Stop being over-dramatic about the state of this game. Just be *perfectly*-dramatic instead; xD Otherwise, you’re hurting bns worse than it’s hurting itself."

ryona,ffgllg6,t1_ffgl1u7,1579909065.0,"Eh, nah, it’s gotta be a mix of everything imo; if it’s *just* blatant, uninspired pain, it’s closer to guro, and I consider that a different fetish. Blatant pain is unimaginative and too real to me. Exaggerated, fetishized ‘pain’ where it’s humiliating and dominating is better than just a bland punch, for example.

Now, a punch where the girl is pinned down, and she’s exaggerating her foot-wiggles after being punched to emphasize that she can’t escape and is helpless: *That’s* ryona.

And as for being picked up, I mean, being picked up cradle-style isn’t hot, but being picked up armypress-style over the head while the chick is wriggling around and groaning is hot even if it’s not realistically painful yet (perhaps uncomfortable though, and I consider an excessive amount of discomfort to count as ryona as well. It’s sort of similar to pain, but not quite)."
ryona,ffgjnqg,t1_ffgbn4k,1579907770.0,"Well, like I said, I think the true, most basic components of the fetish are helplessness; humiliation; and domination (I.E. *being* dominated).

Naturally, pain feeds into this fetish because for somebody to be feeling pain: 

- it must mean they’re in some sort of helpless situation - because people don’t typically *willingly* feel pain.

- and for them to be unwillingly feeling pain, they’d have to be getting bested by something/unable to stop it (at least in the moment), so you could say they’re being dominated by whatever/whoever it is.

- and if they don’t enjoy the pain, that’s where the humiliation part might come in.

Coincidentally, pain checks all the boxes on this fetish, BUT, there are things I’d consider ryona that aren’t necessarily painful:
- bondage
- being picked up off the ground (depending how it’s done isn’t painful, but conveys helplessness)
- being held down
- being forced into a certain position or pose, which doesn’t necessarily have to be painful (like someone flexible having their legs pinned behind their head or something)

There’s admittedly not *much* that isn’t painful when it comes to ryona, but like I said: That’s just due to the nature of the three key things we find attractive in ryona."

bladeandsoul,ffejv8e,t3_et2b7n,1579851028.0,"Idk if the clan-leader is in here reading comments, but if you are: Your *only* slip up in my eyes was your pessimistic assumptions that players only want to share because “the game is dying” or “they’re lazy” and “[ad-hominem nonsense].”

...They want to share because it’s the fair, enjoyable, community-oriented, and *logical* thing to do, and it was *already done* before in a previous PvP event that took place in the cinderlands; There’s no valid reason *not* to try to make this a civil event where people can wander around, be communal, form consensual kill-circles where everyone takes turns killing, etc. etc. 

THAT part about not wanting to be peaceful is - in my mind - *actually* the only truly selfish, illogical thing you said/decided on, and that should be reconsidered."

But yeah, it would be nice if they could’ve just done gear balancing for this event. For people who are decently geared like me, I’ll probably be able to enjoy some combat and at least have some survivability while I’m out there, but for players who are a little newer, it’s definitely going to be an issue."
