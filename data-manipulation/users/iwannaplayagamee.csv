MachineLearning,fdcf90h,t3_ekhtxg,1578273447.0,"Like some others suggest, I would recommend you to extract features (auto/cross correlation, spectral or statistical features) that are markers for abnormality as opposed to classifying based on the time domain samples itself.

A relevant example worth looking at would be the Sepsis prediction challenge (solved) hosted by Computing in Cardiology 2019: [https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/) . The dataset is open access and it consists of several physiologic measures such as heart rate, temperature, oxygen saturation, etc. The data is unequal length, and I think there maybe some missing value scenarios (I'm not sure though). This solution may give you some direction to build your model.

Edit: I am aware that the sepsis challenge is supervised learning - but the data pre-processing part (such as normalization, truncation, interpolation, etc) maybe helpful for what you're trying to do."
