Your problem is that your whole ideology is based on fear mongering statistics that you canâ€™t actually understand properly that capture a VERY vast situational demographic, and then you spew your negative, unproductive, shit-bile over all aspects of your life.

Of course not all women bawl when theyâ€™re broken up with and that I should consider.
