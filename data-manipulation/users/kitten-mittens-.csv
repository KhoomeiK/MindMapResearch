They’re trying to figure out if CBD is a safe alternative to recommend changes to the substance-abuse policies. The point I’m making is that the NFL should allow players to use marijuana and CBD (if it’s legal in their state/city) and shouldn’t need to waste this time determining if players should be granted the right to do that. Every day these players need to wait to try alternative remedies is another day they’re forced to take addictive painkillers.

It stated “The Committee invited manufacturers of CBD products to share their research today so the Committee may hear and consider the possible scientific evidence base for CBD use as a pain management alternative.” So yes, they are trying to figure out if CBD is a healthier alternative.
