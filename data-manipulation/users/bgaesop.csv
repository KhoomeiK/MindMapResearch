No, it's a mobile game called Sonic Forces (unrelated to the console game of the same name). Like all mobile games, it has a lootbox component, and in this case the way it works is that to unlock/upgrade characters you need ""cards"", and the lootboxes give you random cards. All cards associated with a given character are the same - it's things like ""collect 200 movie Sonic cards to unlcok movie Sonic"".

The first is that in Race it's very possible to get a hand of cards that you can't really do anything with, wasting a turn, while this basically can't happen in Roll. 

The second is that in Race you may have an idea for a strategy, start implementing it, and then somebody else gets a card that you needed and now you're screwed, and there's nothing you could have done to prevent it. Again, can't happen in Roll. 

The last is that, like many games with a lot of cards (Magic being the apex example), you have a huge advantage if you've memorized what all the cards do, which I find really frustrating. In Roll, you can look at the game state and look at the reference guide on your player shield and now you know everything you need to know. This makes it much easier for experienced players and newbies to play in the same game without the newbies just flailing around and not accomplishing anything, which makes for a much more enjoyable experience imo

""Gender"" isn't an objective category the way that ""sex"" is (yes, ""sex"", like nearly all empirical categories, has some fuzziness on the borders - but it's far more objective than ""gender"" is).

If there's someone who identifies as gay but keeps having consensual sex with people of the opposite sex, then while it's their prerogative to identify however they please, but it's also reasonable to disagree with them.

For instance, I know a trans man who identifies as asexual. He also is in a long term non-monogamous sexually active relationship, actively seeks out new sex partners on the regular, and propositions people for sex so frequently that he's gotten in trouble more than once for sexual harassment.
