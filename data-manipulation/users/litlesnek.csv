Thanks to the woman in my life. She's fucking perfect and the way we treat eachother makes me so happy. I'm happier than I've ever been and it's all thanks to her. I honestly can't tell her how much i love her without looking like I'm mentally ill. She's genuinely the love of my life and if theres a god I'm begging her/him to keep us together untill our death.

I love you with all of me L***, and I know you do too with me <3"
AMA,femw3ke,t3_eppr80,1579271143.0,"This is so interesting! 

Does having small breasts yourself make you look at womens breasts differently?

Is your body mostly female except for the genitals? Like your thighs and such mostly female features.

And if you do have a mostly female body, do actual female body's still turn you on?

Do you have a male or female expression in your face?

Has a boy ever hit on you only to realize you weren't female?

Sorry for all the questions, thanks for doing this AMA!"

AstralProjection,fe7zktf,t3_enim7o,1578920871.0,"I just attempted this. I hope someone might be able to add to what i can do to help get out of body, since it didnt work for me.

When i was reading this method i could think of the feeling of climbing a rope whilst being near weightless, so i had good hopes it might actually work. I went upstairs, put on some baggy clothes and layed down. I calmed down and after figuring out the visualization for a bit i was thinking of climbing the rope, i got very pumped up for some reason. Not my muscles but just like insane adrenaline. It would go away after taking a deep breath. I had this happen multiple times. One time i heard my hearing kind of digitalize and getting crisp, dont know how to explain it. It gave the feeling of crystals in a way. But thats as far as i got. Tried for quite a long time, over 45mins.

Does anyone know what i should do to improve? Thanks in advance!! :)"
