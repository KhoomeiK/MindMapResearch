But I understand what you mean when say meaningless."
me_irl,fe7ut97,t3_eo0ooc,1578919488.0,"English also have gender, but in most cases it is not morphologically marked. Gender is (linguistically speaking) a grammatical feature, not just the morphologic mark.

Even though, in English personal pronouns are marked in gender."

facepalm,fdk3mla,t1_fdk0hjd,1578495248.0,"Most of those words have entered to english from french romances, not directly from latin.

But in order to be meticulous, most of the words that are not marked are germanic words, so there is no english in this petition at all, just a mix between german and french, which at the end of the day is just a fancy proto-indo-european."
