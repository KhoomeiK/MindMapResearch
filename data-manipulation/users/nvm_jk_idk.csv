AdobeIllustrator,fezh282,t3_eqv5gt,1579457256.0,"These are fantastic! I need to work on my Illustrator skills. 

I don’t know if you’re looking for critique, but if I had any I’d say the highlights in the paint look a little off, like there’s more than one light source. Some are top left, some bottom right. I’d maybe make the ones on the drips into just a thin vertical line along the edge of the drip, without the “corner” look. Honestly though, that’s the only criticism I have. These are really wonderful."

AskAnAmerican,fecrxng,t1_fecqzcb,1578982316.0,"I don't disagree with you, actually. I know there are a sickening amount of horrible human beings out there pretending to be parents (and I'm so sorry you ended up with at least one of them). The point I tried to make in my original response upthread was that we need to be sure that when we give children adult medications, we ALSO put into place programs to absolutely ENSURE they are still taken care of. WHEN they continue to do stupid things while on adult medication.

For example, don't send home a packet and assume they'll read it and not toss it in the trash so Mom doesn't see. Have a nurse sit down and go over it with them the first time they're prescribed the pill without a parent's permission.

Don't assume a teen in the ER is not on birth control if a parent is present; add something to ""the script"" the includes warnings about birth control p/antibiotics so at least they KNOW there's a higher pregnancy risk. This can be done in a way that doesn't alert the parent, if it's passed off as policy.

That kind of thing. If we are assuming teens are going to go out and have sex despite all risks, then ""we"" -- as a society/government/medical community -- need to assume they will still make OTHER risky decisions, and take extra steps accordingly."
AskAnAmerican,fecpsto,t1_fe8wj8g,1578980267.0,"The blood clot was just an example, it feels like maybe you overlooked my main point -- the kid is not going to bring up their BC in front of their parent that they didn't tell in the first place.

In an even more likely scenario, let's say kiddo just has a simple infection of some sort, unrelated, and is given antibiotics by Urgent Care or ER or any number of doctors without access to her medical records. If (because of the presence of a parent) she doesn't tell them she's on BC, no one will think to warn HER that some antibiotics can lower the efficacy of the pill. So she could be in more danger of pregnancy for a time and not know it. (I know several grown women who got pregnant this way, it is fairly common not to know that.)

I just don't think it's a great idea to give children access to adult medications without realistic expectations in place. If we can say ""kids will be kids"" to give them the meds, understand that ""kids will STILL BE KIDS"" when it comes to telling or not telling when it becomes necessary to tell. 

There is a reason we have guardianship until they are 18."
AskAnAmerican,fe6qt9i,t1_fe6d1gl,1578901053.0,"I think you’re overlooking the likely scenario where a child with a sudden complication (such as a blood clot — extreme example but no others come to mind) is taken to the ER by a parent, who, remember they were not comfortable enough with to communicate their desire to start taking hormonal birth control. How is this child going to communicate to an unfamiliar doctor that they want to talk privately, or speak up and say they’re on it right in front of that parent? If they didn’t tell you when it was mildly uncomfortable they’re sure as heck not going to speak up when they KNOW it’s bad. (Source: parent of a teen)

And before you tell me a doctor will ask the parent to leave — I have never been asked to leave triage unless an X-ray was brought in, whether there with my kid, my husband, my sister or my father in law. So these aren’t extreme-case concerns. They’re legitimate ones. I’m not saying BC shouldn’t be more available, but there has to be extra education involved regarding what to do if the teen ends up in this kind of situation."

fatlogic,fcw0qvd,t1_fcsc8m6,1578014478.0,"That last line is telling. I often heard the argument that even though they were obese, their blood work was all perfect and they were healthy as a horse. Then I heard the term ""occult diabetes"" and realized how good our bodies really are at compensating for poor behavior and habits -- until they aren't. My blood sugar was always FINE, even when I knew I was pounding down dozens of cookies and chocolate and carb rich food on a daily basis. I didn't know that my body could actually just be super good at making insulin to compensate, and that that insulin overproduction (which they don't test for) is actually what would hurt me. I just suddenly had the triglycerides of a middle aged man (as a female in my 30s) and syrupy blood that made me sluggish and constantly exhausted, and that was my wake up call. Finally.

But until the living room ceiling falls in, everyone is content to ignore the sound of running water in the upstairs bathroom. Sigh."

fatlogic,fcrgs7s,t3_eiii15,1577901631.0,"Okay, I won’t shove my weight loss tips in your face, but stop coming up to me to ask how I got so thin so that the minute I open my mouth you can start telling me all the reasons that would NEVER work for you. 

I feel like some people bait you to start talking so they can make you feel like you’re being pushy. Then they have a defense, so they can keep on their road to self destruction. And it’s not like I don’t remember what it’s like to be defensively determined to keep crashing and burning, but don’t ask me for my advice (or experience) just so you can bash it."

It's been more than 20 years and I'm still traumatized. I hope your remaining babies will be okay!"
