This is old news, just on a different site, so people see it, and think something new has come up, and look at it, to wonder why. These types of posts don't care if you read the article, they care about you clicking them, which is why a sensationalized title does the trick. It's going to be taken the one way by many people, because they assume this is news, as in NEW, and not just a regurgitation of pre existing information that just has an intentionally misleading title. The article is poorly worded, and that alone makes it worthy of criticism. If you're going to do any form of journalism, even something as simple as a blog, you are expected to convey the information with as much clarity as possible. Serebii had this news on their site instantly, what's the point in posting it weeks later with no new information? Because the intent is to make a misleading title to get that one click. They know nobody is going to be interested in news they knew weeks ago, so they need to make a title like that instead. Even after reading the article, I was confused, because I was looking for where it confirmed all Pokemon were returning. And as I already said, just a slight alteration gives it much more clarity.

news,ffphaei,t1_ffpc2js,1580095016.0,"I like how you still completely disregard the fact you are posting someone accusing her of bragging it while ignoring the same article saying that her friend's said she seemed upset after the encounter. You seem really defensive to post this whole thing when all I said was that you are ignoring a big part of the article for your own argument. You don't even address it.

And just because the trauma can be consistent with casual sex, doesn't mean it was. And it's interesting how you say she had sex hours after Bryant, when that was just a claim by the defense; she said she put on dirty underwear by mistake for the test. It's interesting how you gloss over that the panties she wore during the test were different from the ones she was wearing during Kobe; and the ones that she wore to the test had DNA from the 2nd man. This is from the same article; it's clear what you are doing here, you are only presenting the defense's case but completely ignoring the prosecution's case, and treating the defense's case as fact and not claims. And if it was before Bryant, why would it be on him or his clothing if he may have not had clothing on around where he could've gotten it on him, and how is it not plausible he could have cleaned up afterwards? I'm skeptical he was fully clothed during this, and I doubt there was much clothing on if he had any on that could've gotten some of the DNA on him. Does it mean she did not have sex right after?  And regardless, that does not mean she could not have been raped by him.

The defense's witness also could not say without doubt that she had sex right after the encounter with Bryant. You are ignoring so much from these articles you are linking, and just cherrypicking your argumentsh here. You are implying that it is a fact she had sex right after the incident with Kobe. It seems like you are just echoing what the defense said as fact, when these are just claims, same as the defense's. We all draw our own conclusions from what happened, but I am not going to treat it as if every accusation by either party cannot be called into question. You are also presenting a random person who was once linked with the accuser as more credible. This is just a person making claims, same as the accuser, but you treat one as more credible even though there is no evidence they were actually looking to bed a celebrity. And even if they were, that does not mean they cannot be forced into certain sexual acts, even if they did consent to having sex. It really seems like this person was just out to get her, randomly bringing up the fact she had sex with a guy because she looked like Timberlake, which has nothing to do with these accusations. And again, the same article you are linking also says someone saying that she DID seem upset. Why are you so intent on presenting only one side of the article that makes it look like it's a false accusation? You clearly have an agenda.

>Bobby Pietrack, a bellman and high school friend of the woman, said she appeared to be very upset. ""As we started to walk to the time clock (she) grabbed my arm and started to cry and said that Kobe Bryant choked her,"" Pietrack wrote in a police statement. ""After we clocked out, I asked her to tell me everything, and that is when she told me that Kobe Bryant had forced sex with her."" He added: ""She was very shaken and she was crying"" as the two walked to their cars from the hotel.

Seriously, why are you doing this? You completely ignored this statement and only acknowledged the statement that implied she was falsely accusing Kobe. Do you not see any problem with that? Regardless of whether you think he did it or not, you should at least realize you are deliberately leaving stuff out if it makes your argument less credible.

And what does mental illness have to do with this? She's been suicidal, so somehow that makes it less likely that she isn't making this up? What the fuck? Again, regardless of whether you think she's telling the truth or not, implying that someone who is suicidal is more prone to make false rape claims is wrong. Where is the correlation between the two? And nowhere does it say she was a danger to anyone but herself, now you are just making stuff up. Why are you lying if you think this case is so cut and dry? Are you doing it intentionally, or do you not even read the articles you are posting?

And you are posting someone from CBS' opinion on the evidence or lack thereof as being the case in the courtroom. Why does his opinion matter, when he is not actually involved with this case? Legal analyst or not, this is just his opinion and not indicative of the judge's or anyone else involved in the case's feelings.

And embellishment does not mean she lied about the encounter either. If she was truly interested in making a false accusation, she wouldn't have come clean about these details that really don't have a significant impact on proving innocence or guilt. It calls her credibility into question a bit, but it is not as big of a deal as you are making it, and not something I would expect from a false accuser; they have no reason to come clean over such trivial details. They would know it would hurt themselves if they were indeed a false accuser, so there is no incentive for them to tell this. Also important to note that Kobe was lying about this from the very start, which you fail to mention. You can at least point out that both the defendant and the accuser had lied in this case before; personally, I think lying about having sex with her is a bigger lie than the ones she told, and much more harmful.

I am not going to say one way or another in this comment whether Kobe raped her or not. But just the way you are presenting the information here is EXTREMELY misleading, and most people will take what you are saying at face value, because they will not bother reading the articles as I have. You only are presenting things that make your argument look more credible, but ignoring things in the very same articles you are linking that tip the scales in the other direction. I completely read every article you linked; you could at least do the same if you're going to link them.

Really, my main point is this: you NEED to look at both sides of this case as I have. I haven't presented any of this as fact, many of these are claims by others, same as yours, but I am not attempting to spin these accusations as any more credible than the ones you have provided; it is important to consider this case based on what both sides are saying, and not just one. You seem to be leaning very hard into the defense's claims and evidence while completely ignoring the other side, even though it is also talked about in the articles and somewhat discredits some of what you are saying as being fact; I am not saying it means that claims such as her having sex right after Kobe or that people saying she seemed fine were wrong. I am just saying that there are claims that say the contrary, and it's important to listen to all these claims in order to make an informed decision. I think with this case in particular, people are swayed more by their own opinions rather than evidence, because that's all we have to go on. There is no unquestionable evidence that it did or didn't happen, and to me, there isn't substantial evidence on either side to even say with utmost certainty.

I will say that it is a bit interesting that he settled this out of court, with the apology he gave, rather than stick to his guns to exonerate himself and discredit the accuser.

>*First, I want to apologize directly to the young woman involved in this incident. I want to apologize to her for my behavior that night and for the consequences she has suffered in the past year. Although this year has been incredibly difficult for me personally, I can only imagine the pain she has had to endure. I also want to apologize to her parents and family members, and to my family and friends and supporters, and to the citizens of Eagle, Colorado. I also want to make it clear that I do not question the motives of this young woman. No money has been paid to this woman. She has agreed that this statement will not be used against me in the civil case. Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter. I issue this statement today fully aware that while one part of this case ends today, another remains. I understand that the civil case against me will go forward. That part of this case will be decided by and between the parties directly involved in the incident and will no longer be a financial or emotional drain on the citizens of the state of Colorado.*

Honestly, his apology does make me have second thoughts on his innocence. Even if he believes this act was consensual, he also admitted that she did not see the incident as the same way, and understands that she feels she did not consent. Really, this boils down to ""I believed it was consensual, but to her it was not"", which really is just saying it was rape even though he did not intend to rape her, as he claims. I cannot wrap my head around an innocent person saying something like this; I can see that settling it out of court for an innocent person may make some sense, but as I said, this makes me second guess him being innocent. And again, I am not saying this makes him guilty, the same as you should recognize some of the things you have linked do not make this a false accusation. Personally, I think it would be a bit odd for an innocent man to release such a statement; not impossible, but odd.

Also, your idea isn't bad, but the thing is this; when taxpayers/the government are the ones footing the bill, they will be more inclined to reduce those prices.  Your idea just makes it that much more complicated. The government should work towards affordable healthcare if they refuse to work towards universal healthcare, which we should have anyway. Obviously it isn't as simple as making insulin be paid for through taxes, but it incentivizes people doing something about absurd costs. The fact is that universal health care is the best solution we have at preventing people from being ruined financially due to health care costs. Insulin costs is one drop in a pool of a shitty health care system. Unfortunately taxes are also a mess with how they are taken, and how many tax breaks the wealthiest people/companies get, which is something that should also be changed alongside universal health care."

The guy you responded to said the game was not for everyone, but you disagreed with him, as if that opinion is somehow wrong. You're trying to use your own opinions as an argument for why the game is objectively bad. Just because you don't see it as a masterpiece does not mean others didn't.

To pretend like it's just a vocal minority who likes this game is ridiculous when it still sells incredibly well nearly 3 years later, and loved by many people, not a single subreddit.

PublicFreakout,ff5nnoa,t1_ff5a3j1,1579602031.0,"Cultural issues. Many people put men above women there, and it's like that many women who are assaulted/harassed are too ashamed or afraid to go forward with it, because they're told to endure this kind of abuse, and might even be the ones blamed for it. 

I don't think it's necessarily that there's more pervs there, granted there would be with a higher population, but I think it's more that it is something easier to get away with there, so people are less discouraged about doing it."

They have rules against more than two consecutive terms, which I believe are also 4 years each, so Putin cannot run a third consecutive term. Instead, a puppet President is elected, but everyone knows Putin is still running things and will be back in 4 years. This isn't the first time. Basically, Putin is always going to be in power, because the guy who wins will still answer to him."

She made some good moves, sure, but those moves never got her far, and she was always on the wrong side of the numbers. She had the social game to win, but she never made it to FTC, and if all you're good at is your social game, it puts a target on your back, which is why Amanda voted her off. She was good enough to not be a goat and even win at FTC, but wasn't good enough to actually get to FTC. I just think it's ridiculous to put her in the top 3 best players category."

Getting out before a merge doesn't necessarily mean you aren't good at the game; sometimes you get eliminated early because you're that much of a threat. Of course, usually teams flounder when they do something like that, because they eliminated a stronger player that would help keep the numbers going into a merge.

He also is really charismatic making him fun to watch."

NintendoSwitch,ff2ogie,t3_erb6dz,1579516344.0,"The pro is better than the joycons that make the single controller. It is not even a contest. Also, I don't think the Pro controller experiences drift, at least nowhere near as much as the joycons do. But if you're playing on a commute, wouldn't you just play in handheld mode? In which case you don't need the Pro Controller. I wouldn't recommend it unless you primarily play on TV. I always play handheld except when I'm playing couch co op, in which case we just play with joycons. Smash Bros sounds like it would be good for you; it's an online competitive game, and while you can't play online during your commute, you can get practice in and still have fun."

Also, this says nothing about the market, when tons of these webtoons are completely free.

It's a doomsaying article that you skimmed. It basically just makes the argument that digital is overtaking physical. And even with this growth, it's so far away from reaching manga, if it can at all.

Also, every article I am reading reports that the manga industry is on a rise. Looking at ACTUAL numbers, the manga industry grew 16% between January and May of last year. So it's booming if anything.

It's becoming very clear you're just here to troll."
