Get dressed in an outfit that looks good on you. Go out to the park, city, restaurant, etc. with a friend, or even by yourself. Have a friend/stranger take a good photo of you. Bonus points if a stranger will take a photo of you and a friend.

Use that as your profile picture, block out friend's face if they're in the picture.

Your profile is where you write info that serves as a hook to a story or conversation starter. For example: I'm left handed, so I wrote something along the lines of ""commiserating about the dextral tyranny."" Had a bunch of girls ask me what that was as the first message the sent. Went on several dates with a girl who said she wasn't left handed, but wore her watch on her right hand anyway. Something just teensy bit absurd works wonders.

If all you do is play videogames, you're going to have a hard time finding someone. It's a sad fact, but you need to develop hobbies outside of that. Hiking is a cheap, easy hobby, that pretty much everyone is open to. You don't even have to be good at it if you say something like ""I'm starting to get into hiking, so I'm in search of some good trails & beginners advise.""

I used OkCupid to find my wife, so idk how tinder works, but I had a very effective strategy that utilized the notification of when someone visited your profile. If I liked a girl's preview on the matching thing, I'd visit her profile so she'd get a notification. I would not message her right away. If she checked out my profile and liked me back, I would visit her profile again and pick out a few things to talk about from her profile, but I still wouldn't message her. If she visited a second time, I would message her asking a question based on her profile and 9/10 times I'd get a response. Often that'd get people to send me messages first, which is a bonus.

Even if you're not super interested in someone that messaged you talk to them anyways. You're not obligated to go on dates with them, and you can let the conversation fizzle out whenever you want. The important thing is that you get experience, find out what kinds of conversation topics keep things going for yourself and others.

Last and most important thing. BRAG ABOUT YOURSELF. Talk about what you're great at, and don't give people your self-criticisms right off the bat. You want people to think you're amazing, so don't tell them why you think you're not like you did in that comment."

I think the Plagueis novel was the first time someone wrote Plagueis as Palpatine's Master. When that was made legends, Palpatine's former master was up in the air again.
