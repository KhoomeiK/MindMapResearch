That aside, bleach does NOT kill parvo completely and should never be thought of as doing so.  Bleach and ResCue are just rhe closest thing we can come to.  Porous surfaces cannot be cleaned at all.  Time must pass in order to be sure (and yes, years will suffice), but if the yard was contaminated, thats a whole other issue as they are harder to rid of parvo."
dogs,ffi0imm,t3_etqmqu,1579961342.0,"Crate traiming will be a must.  Leaving a dog in the yard will either cause him to ruin things or escape.  Assuming u have to leave for work, you will want to invest in a HEAVY DUTY almost-military style crate that he cant break out of. Its ideal that u would be able to ease into it, but odds are, you are currently working or need to run errands.

I had a foster who destroyed my guest room and eventually became ok w the crate thru training.  But the heavy duty one is necessary bc a) if they think they can get out, they will destroy it, and b) they could hurt themselves in the process of getting out (ie ripping a tooth out, or getting choked as they squeeze out the bent door).

These crates are expensive by so worth it for your peace of mind, and for the same of getting this new pup to calm.

Some ppl suggest calming music or the tv while u r gone.  My foster HATED it.  It made it so much worse! So just be open to it may work or it may not.

Eventually the dog will learn its ok.  My foster chilled in his crate while i was at work (6.5 hours), then i would come home and we would spend the rest of the day playing and getting exercise, and he would sleep in it too.  I think sleeping in it really helps them understand it is a safe place.  Always gave him a kong of pb and toys, but nothing he could bite into small pieces and choke on.  

He was a good boy and reluctantly climbed in, but he didnt freak out like he did at the beginning.  Once he started to be ok w it, he had to learn to hold it until i got home from work. Not sure if it was his age, his training, his metabolism, or he was mad. Sometimes he did and sometimes he didnt, so make sure to place a tarp under the crate and up the wall if its by the wall. That also got better with time. I also used a lot of really cheap fleece blankets from kohls for bedding that were easy to wash when it happened.

Heres a suggested product.

Whats worse is that puppies they have taken in have tested positive for parvo, which means its on their property, and they are still knowingly bringing puppies into it.

dogs,fff824q,t1_fff0trv,1579878042.0,"A little about my experience:

I got a puppy at after college at 23 yo.  By 23, i had lived abroad and traveled extensively.  I was also living across the country from home at the time.  I know that not everyone has that opportunity, but if possible everyone should travel.  So, i suppose my advice is more along the lines of life philosophy rather than dog ownership.  

The advice regarding the years after college is huge.  Whether you are planning for grad school now, planning to stay home while u do, etc, life hardly ever pans out the way u think it will.  Housing w a dog is nearly impossible in some areas w housing shortages.  Plus, whether you work, go to grad school, live at home, etc, u r cash strapped for a number of years, and its not responsible to get a dog if u wouldnt be able to financially handle an emergency.  (To be clear, i dont have 7k just waiting around for emergency surgery, and im not saying u have ti be in that position.  However i have a credit card, excellent credit, and a home equity loan to pull from if necessary.  I see way too many ppl dependent on gofundme to get their dogs medical attention.)

My dog gave me so much love, but i also needed to be in the right place in my life in order to give him what he needed in return.  Had i gotten him earlier, that would not be the case.  I would not have traveled abroad, had so many beautiful experiences and met so many beautiful people.  I wouldnt have been able to pick up and move across the country.  I know that i am privileged and lucky in that regard, but i would hate for someone to box themselves in.  

Its clear you have done a lot of planning (for that, props), but i  would warn you that amount of care for a dog at that age can be very restricting.  You made a good plan, but as i read it, i think back to how i used my time at that age.  I had a lot of beauitful experiences that have shaped who i am today.  

I know you mentioned living w ur parents, but u should also think of a plan where u r solely responsible bc thats how it should be if u r the owner.  None of the plan should depend on them, and my advice is not to get tied down w those kinds of responsibilities yet."
