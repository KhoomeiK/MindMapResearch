We’re *already* sending supplies to the ISS. What’s changing out the payload to include another rod when one is expended and having the ISS rendezvous with the satellite to perform maintenance? Considering this is already part of the ISS’s mission, basically the cost of fuel for the weight of the rod... and I’m willing to bet that after the first boat gets slammed by a fuckin’ rod from space and any government agency (lets say everyone, all countries, agrees that we’re going to put an anti-albatross murder satellite in space) takes credit for it people will think twice about murdering the albatross. Kill an albatross, get an *exact geolocation* of the target. Upload coordinates, use existing survey sats to confirm target and away she goes...

By comparison an ICBM with cluster explosives is... completely un-reusable. The rods-from-god is a one-time cost to launch the sat, and possibly a two-three time cost to replenish rods but if they’re smart they’d send up like 6-8 in the first place. When the rod-sat starts sinking boats nobody is going to want to risk it. Not to mention that the explosives and rocket debris would do far more environmental damage than a single ceramic rod. Plus the rod would sink the boat and make it into a reef. The explosives would just disintegrate it. 

Think about it, sample radio convo.

Animal tracking science center (Tracker 11): USCG, this is Tracker one-one, be advised we have a downed albatross at 24° 23' 22.2'' Sierra by 136° 8' 8.88'' Whiskey. (random coords)

USCG: Copy that Fisher one-one, we’ll relay the message to USAF. Can you confirm bird downed by a vessel?

Tracker 11: Affirmative. Bird was on a south-easterly course at approximately two-zero-zero meters altitude and suddenly dropped to zero meters altitude. We have an affirmative signature on vessel from bird’s radar tracker, last known position was [coordinates here]. 

USGC: Copy. We’ll have USAF take a look on their next pass over the area. 

Within the hour they’d have a sat pointed at that area, see a ship that’s definitely *not* supposed to be there and WHAM.
