spiderbro,ffkmas4,t1_ffki7q4,1580025107.0,"Haha, it's all good. There's a few jokes about that at the moment. I live in a part of NE Victoria that narrowly avoided getting burnt a few weeks ago, but the storms and rain afterwards were intense.

My back veranda looked like something from a horror film when the rest of those spiders I don't normally see came out of the trees to seek refuge.

The kangaroos and parrots disappeared for a while but have since returned in droves, along with a bunch of pointy reptiles I don't normally see."
spiderbro,ffkj6l7,t1_ffkap87,1580023641.0,"They're just hairy little aliens that do pest extermination for free, nothing to worry about. I prefer having a few large spiders inside that *might* touch my face while I sleep, to a cloud of flies and mosquitoes buzzing around"
spiderbro,ffkgq9p,t1_ffkb3pj,1580022480.0,"It's a little bit different in Australia where the bugs are ten times larger than anything outside the Amazon, but you learn to live with the ones that don't try to kill you. I was terrified of these when they were a rare occurrence in the city, but I'm right in the middle of their natural habitat now. If I tried to relocate one, two more would move in to take its place"
spiderbro,ffk8gqx,t1_ffk5ywx,1580018678.0,"Pretty much. Delena Carcerides have a legspan up to about 7 inches, but they have tiny little bodies with fangs that take up half their face. Other varieties in the tropics are the size of dinner plates, so I have the ""small"" ones. Being ambush predators that don't spin webs, they just kind of wander around. One day they're sleeping in the refrigerator door handle, the next day they're under the toilet seat

They're like an athletic tarantula. Skinny little things, but very fast."
unpopularopinion,ffjivj1,t3_etr0sb,1579999220.0,I like you. I like your words and illogical hatred.
spiderbro,ffjhx7g,t3_etwofd,1579998586.0,"I live in an ancient old place in the bush where the doors and windows don't close properly, so I always have a few hand-sized huntsmans stomping around.

I'm less of a housemate, more a ""subject"" of their rule"
aww,ffh7cgz,t1_ffh00lr,1579925164.0,"Service dog owners, not whatever ""teams"" you're thinking about. 

They do it anyway and get away with it. If you've ever met a person with an assistance animal for medical reasons, you'd see that they treat them as an extension of their own bodies. The animals are meant to be invisible. They hop into taxis, walk into bars and go on plane rides like regular guide dogs for the blind"
AskReddit,ffh0oqd,t3_etcyd6,1579919970.0,"Forcibly relocate them to the middle of nowhere. Give them $100, a tent, an axe, and say ""fuck off outta here"". 

I managed to botch two suicide attempts and took a stack of medication to convince me that working a corporate desk job that only covered half my rent was normal. Flipped out, drove for days into the middle of nowhere, and got a job fisting cows that paid more than my boss made in days. 

Location is everything"
