StarWars,ffb17yl,t1_ff9n603,1579749266.0,Yeah that’s why I kinda suspected it in the first place. He’s just got that I’m always fucking with you in his own sick way personality.
AskReddit,ffale1v,t3_eskuf4,1579738659.0,"The options given give some large caps in content possibly missed. I would propose having for one a top of the last 3 days button in case it’s not a reddit I frequent daily but was on earlier in the week. 
Also the top of the last 3 or so month’s or season would be cool to see what’s up on subreddits ive definitely been on within the year but not recently. Just an idea!"
