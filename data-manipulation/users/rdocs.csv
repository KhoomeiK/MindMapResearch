ems,fgk8ato,t3_eyr4xx,1580859645.0,"If you are recognized as competent in your state you can work, but to be employed you must be verified as a medic this technically means your identification and number must be verified by your employer however it does not mean that you shouldnt have a card on hand. Most of the time your place of employment will put you on orientee status til everything comes together and you are solid. Regardless a lot of this depends on what chances your employer is willing to take. In my state obviously credentials are handled by office and the card is almost a secondary aspect. It really depends on how acservice wants to play the gray areas on this. When I got my national registry, my state lic was still in preparation I was in orientation on a service but couldnt run on my own til I was state recognized."

Paramedics,fgjvm3b,t3_eyv7jz,1580852259.0,"Wow this will be diverse, but in my experience the nurse is kindof admin under the Doc. But we are also an ambulance service.Depending on role Emt or Medic you can do more based on said license.  Now medics are secondary to physicians on Codes ( they also operate as team.leads on Crash team in hospital,and often run them as well as traumas and intubations and transport of pt to critical care facility typically 1 hr away.  
My typical roles are as follows:
Shift supervisor, primary or secondary on crash team, we have 2 trucks and 1 als 1 bls which I send them based on dispatch. Airway team in er. I can give meds in er, quite a few that nurses cant aka anesthesia meds, K and Propofol most notably! EMT's usually can do draws, iv and 12 lead. Regardless of where you go whomever is in charge of documentation is probably going to have most rank in the ER. If you are new to EMS however you can learn a lot by being in a clinical setting for things such as intubations and getting a better understanding of labs!
Its ems ur gonna hafta respect in smaller areas but it definately aint for everyone."
