deadbydaylight,ffj0sj1,t3_etrb46,1579987510.0,"I enjoy being 30m away from the killer and getting downed from a random hit that, again, is nowhere close. /s 


For real though, I love this game. I just wish it weren’t so buggy."
deadbydaylight,fffep27,t3_etbn7r,1579882328.0,"Looking for some people to just have some lax custom games with. Practicing looping as killer or surv, practicing killers, etc. just wanna practice. No gen rushing or anything. I play on PC. My steam name is petrifiedferret. PM if you can’t find me

Mic not required. I’m a nervous pervous, so I probably won’t be down with it at first. I’m in the USA east coast. I’m a college student, so Fridays and weekends are the best times I can play."
college,feenfca,t1_fee5zrz,1579037287.0,I wish you the best of luck! Choose what YOU want to do. Don’t let anyone but yourself influence your choices.
college,fee603o,t1_fedv9zu,1579027112.0,I’d like to become a high school Spanish teacher and freelance translator.
college,fee5yvt,t1_fedwtix,1579027091.0,"Hey! Another Spanish major! Muchas gracias. Hace 6 o 7 años que estudio el español y me gusta un montón. Soy un hablante nativo de inglés. Ni publico mucho en español tampoco, pero no tengo muchas oportunidades para hacerlo. Si jamás quisieras hablar en español, me podrías enviar un mensaje cuando quisieras. 

Gracias.

(P.S. your Spanish is good!)"
deadbydaylight,fedrmpz,t1_fedrhn1,1579018407.0,I may have misunderstood the meme. For some reason I thought the lobby was a place to wait until you got dragged into a match with different people lmao. My bad. Would completely defeat the purpose.
deadbydaylight,fedqbwk,t3_eogdec,1579017591.0,It’d be really cool if we could just run around the campfire area and just act goofy. The Killer(s) can walk on the edges (and we can see them). It’d be so cool!
offmychest,fdcsnj7,t3_eki8ru,1578283186.0,Congratulations! You should be very proud of yourself. :)
deadbydaylight,fdbco6z,t1_fdbcigx,1578256056.0,"I just don’t see how it’s fun. I’m not playing the game to get to rank one or whatever, but I like to get chased when I play surv. It makes it more fun in my opinion."
deadbydaylight,fdawgcn,t1_fdavy2w,1578251151.0,I don’t feel as nooby anymore lol. Thanks!
deadbydaylight,fdas6q1,t3_ekbtn1,1578249419.0,Which perk is this?
Overwatch_Memes,fd3vfij,t3_ejv2sl,1578161979.0,"Every game I play as Moira, it feels like my back will break under the immense pressure of carrying everyone. 10k damage and almost 20k healing every time..."
insaneparents,fcippgg,t1_fcioefc,1577666884.0,"My dad did the same to me two years ago. I was asleep on a Saturday morning and my cousin had gotten locked out of her dorm. My bed was lofted, so my phone was plugged in below; he had called me trying to get ahold of me so I could let her in the building (we stayed in the same hall), but I slept through it. When I woke up, I had so many missed calls and crazy texts. It absolutely sucks. I feel your pain."
insaneparents,fcgare3,t1_fcgamz1,1577638129.0,"In the shower and getting ready. Showering, brushing teeth, flossing, fixing my hair, getting dressed, applying skincare. It adds up."
insaneparents,fcg53rh,t1_fcg4sxs,1577636550.0,I’d say the longest they had was about 20in. Those worked a lot better for me than the smaller ones since I’m a taller guy with long arms.
insaneparents,fcfzzq6,t1_fcfzbqe,1577635236.0,"I wanted to say that, but kinda got scared lol."

insaneparents,fcfffvw,t1_fcff9o8,1577629439.0,Three days is three days. There is no requirement to talk to someone every day when they are toxic as fuck.
insaneparents,fccvcli,t1_fccv9dj,1577603088.0,"There’s a place in a nearby city where you can go axe throwing, which is kinda like bowling. It’s fun!"
insaneparents,fccva6q,t3_eh2zd0,1577603064.0,"!explanation 

So I had not spoken to my grandmother for three days after Christmas because she works night shift and is hating her job. She’d complained to me every day before Christmas that she hated her job and her supervisor, and that she hadn’t been sleeping well. Thus, I didn’t text/call for three days because I didn’t want to accidentally wake her up or agitate her anymore because she was already super upset."
