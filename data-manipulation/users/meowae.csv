>If you want to adopt a cat, but are an allergy suffer, we may have some good news for you!  Siberians are a low allergen or ‘hypoallergenic’ cat. This does not mean that Siberians are ‘allergy-proof’ or cannot cause a reaction in people.  It simply means that they produce less of the [Feline d1 protein (Fel-d1)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fel_d_1) that is found in the cat’s saliva that is thought to be the culprit for producing allergic reactions.  
>  
>Not all Siberians have the same low level of Fel-d1 and some people could react to some Siberian cats and not others. If you are allergic to cats and want to test your allergic response to Siberians, it is best to have an allergy test at our cattery."
