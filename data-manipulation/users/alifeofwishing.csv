vegan,fgzx0cu,t1_fgzwsm1,1581198511.0,"This makes plenty of sense now, thank you."
vegan,fgzukp4,t1_fgxtvx5,1581197768.0,Can you explain the impossible summers and why you would need to run at 2am because of them? I'm completely lost on that one.
JUSTNOMIL,fgzowgr,t1_fgyuafs,1581196240.0,"I hadn't thought to involve the funeral director, so I appreciate the suggestion. Hopefully it will not have to reach that level."
JUSTNOMIL,fgzongg,t1_fgyuffl,1581196167.0,"Thank you for your response and the suggestions.  I'm typically the person who will ask what I can do to help, so I will do my best to take initiative."
JUSTNOMIL,fgznko6,t1_fgyqikm,1581195873.0,"I'm glad to hear it was a peaceful service. 

You're correct, the peace keeper roll shouldn't be their responsibility."
JUSTNOMIL,fgyqb8n,t1_fgylnf0,1581185857.0,"I'm so sorry you had to do this at your nana's funeral. It's always a shame to watch this happen because the family should be celebrating their loved ones life, not focused on drama.

GMIL and MIL have placed the peace keeper role on DH his entire life, so he's made it clear to GMIL and MIL that GMIL will *not* be welcomed. *If* she had the balls to do it, GFIL would have to be the one to drive her and he's been told not to do so. I would have no issue stepping in, but I know that would hurt DH more than anything."

Just kidding, kind of. If I would have married my ex, I can't say for certain that I wouldn't have been an ""Instagram mom"". Thankfully, I realized how toxic my upbringing and behavior was over the years of my now-husband and I's engagement, by watching the same toxic behaviors in his family."
AmItheAsshole,fgtnt4r,t3_f0eq5h,1581106999.0,"NTA. Considering they are great uncles, they're likely up there in years and have probably lived a more conservative life than us younger generations. You were asked to share memories and you shared the ones that meant the most to you. It's not your fault that two people out a room full of people got offended."
