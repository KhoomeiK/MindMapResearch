howtonotgiveafuck,fdgnmas,t1_fdg2nd2,1578403282.0,It's unclear to be sure but any sensation of self does seem to be a projection of some emergent property of the organic material within our skull.  There are countless instances of dramatic changes to personhood when this material is injured or it's chemical balance influenced by various chemicals.
