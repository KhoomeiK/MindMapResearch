No. It's for *children.* But politicians will send their kids to private schools, and tell their poor constituents that their kids must attend the bad government schools.

IAmA,fetf5dc,t3_eqka8n,1579374818.0,"Mr. Vohra, I'm a formerly incarcerated person and a moderator of r/ExCons. Criminal justice reform is very important to me.

About 86% of all federal prisoners are held for victimless crimes. Nearly a quarter of all American prisoners are held pretrial, presumed innocent, simply because they cannot afford to pay bail. When state prisoners are added, nearly half are held on drug or public order charges. (Source: https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2019.html)

So even if you ended the War on Drugs and everyone held on victimless crime charges (including charges like prostitution) was released, this would only be half the total US prison population.

We'd go from having over four times the world average prison population per capita to just over twice the world average.

Ending the War on Drugs alone, even if paired with other victimless crime reforms that Libertarians favor (such as decriminalizing prostitution,) would not, by itself, solve mass incarceration.

Punishment is a broad term. Usually in a non-technical context people mean retribution - specifically, hurting people. I disagree with this on moral grounds.

In my opinion, the only justification for incarceration is public safety: to protect the public from an individual who cannot, by any other means, be dissuaded from harming others. I've written more about this argument here: http://libertyinjustice.blogspot.com/2018/09/first-principles-of-justice.html

Denying medical treatment doesn't improve public safety.

>Mr. Hornberger- I reviewed your positions on the welfare state and drugs. As presently things stand, I am liable for the poor health decisions made by others in drug use, addiction, and crime associated with that addiction through compulsory charity by the welfare state. Does this not suggest there is an order to executing your platform, with first dismantling the welfare state, and then when we are free from the consequences of other Americans bad decisions, legalize drugs? I have very real concern that votes exist to legalize, but votes do not exist to repeal the welfare state, meaning that a vote to legalize equates to a voice to increase my burden of compulsory charity via the welfare state.

>I have similar concerns regarding immigration. As long as we are connected by mandatory participation in socialized programs, it is in my interest to oppose unlimited migration of those who pose net fiscal burden to me via the socialized programs. Again the question of priority emerges, can we only consider increased immigration when at the same time we mitigate the burden on others via the compulsory welfare state?

>And for all of the other programs that represent real liberty gains to take place, is it not true that the most difficult job of dismantling the welfare state must be the first objective?

Libertarian,fdopqly,t1_fdop816,1578610112.0,">Under the doctrine of qualified immunity, public officials are held to a much lower standard. They can be held accountable only insofar as they violate rights that are “clearly established” in light of existing case law. This standard shields law enforcement, in particular, from innumerable constitutional violations each year. In the Supreme Court’s own words, it protects “all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.” It is under this rule that officers can, without worry, drag a nonthreatening, seven months pregnant woman into the street and tase her three times for refusing to sign a piece of paper.

>Qualified immunity permits law enforcement and other government officials to violate people’s constitutional rights with virtual impunity. Today, we hear about police shooting after police shooting where officers are rarely if ever held accountable by the criminal legal system, either because prosecutors decline to charge, because grand juries decline to indict, or because juries decline to convict.

>The Supreme Court invented qualified immunity in 1967, describing it as a modest exception for public officials who had acted in “good faith” and believed that their conduct was authorized by law. Fifteen years later, in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, the Court drastically expanded the defense. The protection afforded to public officials would no longer turn on whether the official acted in “good faith.” Instead, even officials who violate peoples’ rights maliciously will be immune unless the victim can show that his or her right was “clearly established.” Since the Harlow decision, the Court has made it exceedingly difficult for victims to satisfy this standard. To show that the law is “clearly established,” the Court has said, a victim must point to a previously decided case that involves the same “specific context” and “particular conduct.” Unless the victim can point to a judicial decision that happened to involve the same context and conduct, the officer will be shielded from liability.

>The Supreme Court has recognized one exception to this rule, in Hope v. Pelzer. There, corrections officers disciplined a prisoner by handcuffing him to a hitching post for seven hours, with his hands above his shoulders, shirtless in the summer sun. At one point a guard taunted the prisoner by giving water to a guard dog in plain sight. Faced with these circumstances, and no prior case that had confronted similar facts, the Supreme Court ruled that the officers’ cruelty was “so obvious” that they should have had “fair warning” that their conduct violated the constitutional protection against cruel and unusual punishment. Far from creating a meaningful exception, however, courts frequently consider the circumstances in Hope to set the threshold for how egregious an officer’s behavior must be before he is considered to have “fair warning.”

>And that is the law today: ***An officer who knowingly violates someone’s constitutional rights will generally be protected from suit unless the victim can identify previous judicial opinions that addressed the specific context and conduct.*** This is very far afield from what Congress sought to achieve in the Civil Rights Act. Instead of considering whether a person’s civil rights have been violated and, if so, providing that victim with a remedy, courts shut their doors to victims simply because no prior judicial opinion happened to involve the same facts.

I represented the man who this ex-NYPD detective lied into a violent felony indictment. Michael Bergman completely fabricated a fake crime out of spite. If convicted, would’ve faced minimum 3.5 years in prison. Max 15. Today, the liar only got probation.

I remember first meeting Mr. Barbosa. In interview cells attached to the cage behind the arraignment courtroom in Brooklyn criminal court. Like everyone I represent I don’t get to choose. I just happened to be working that day, & a file with his name & charges was handed to me.

The charges were serious. Detective Bergman claimed that after stopping Mr. Barbosa’s car, he accelerated backwards at a high rate of speed, then turned the car toward the Detective. Was right in between headlines. And slammed on gas. Bergman dove out of the way to save his life.

Mr. Barbosa was in a world of trouble. Charged w/ attempted assault in first degree. A Class C violent felony. A brazen act of violence. I wondered what he was thinking. What motivated this? I walked thru the door into the jail directly behind the “In God We Trust” sign in court.

I called his name & he walked in. Tired. Not feeling well. Shaking his head. I told him his charges. And he forcefully denied it. “Didn’t happen. These cops have been harassing me for months. I was parked. They pulled up. I drove off. That was it.” I pressed him more.

“Why on earth would they make something like this up?” I asked. Cops lie all the time. To justify bad stops & frisks, excessive use of force. Sometimes they plant evidence. Big lies. Small lies. Here: there was no motivation. He wasn’t injured. They didn’t find anything on him.

“I honesty don’t know. They don’t like me, but saying I did this?” He trailed off. Put head down. He was really upset. I was having a hard time still believing him. “So you just pulled out? Didn’t accidentally almost hit him?” He shook his head no. “I’ll look for video,” I said.

A reaction to the idea of video surveillance can sometimes be a tell. If not so enthusiastic, it’s likely the video won’t be helpful. But he jumped up:

“There’s video?!”

“I don’t know. I’ll definitely be looking for it.”

“Please, please do. Otherwise it’s my word vs. his.”

Mr. Barbosa knew the reality then: Police can generally say whatever they want. And they know that generally, no matter what, prosecutors, judges, & in the rare case that makes it that far, juries, will believe them over the accused. He was in a serious predicament. Life & death.

Based on this allegation, Mr. Barbosa was remanded to Rikers Island by parole. While he sat on Rikers, Det. Bergman made the decision to take his lie a step further. He could’ve stopped w/ the lie in paperwork. Just let it go. Instead he decided to testify before the grand jury.

Under oath, he told the grand jury a story out of an action movie. How he had to leap out of the way to save his life. How he scratched his arm on the pavement. How he thought he was going to die. The grand jury believed him & voted to indict Barbosa. Thankfully, there was video.

I happen to be blessed to work in a public defender office w/ more resources than most. We have a team of investigators, who spend all day everyday in the field. Witness interviews. Taking measurements. Visiting crime scenes. Tracking down video surveillance. They’re incredible.

Just to stress the point. Most defender offices in the country don’t have any investigators. A large number of offices don’t have funding to meet their clients at first appearances but have to wait days, sometimes weeks. By then video taped over. Evidence gone. Memories faded.

Just to stress the point about lack of access to counsel further: There are large swaths of the country that don’t even have defender offices at all. Judges appoint private attorneys, who get paid relative pennies for it, let alone enough to encourage them to investigate. A sham.

Ok. Back to the nightmare that now-ex NYPD Detective Michael Bergman maliciously inflicted on my client, Pedro Barbosa. And the video that saved his life.

I remember when Julia knocked on my door. “I got video surveillance in the Barbosa case. They lied. It’s clear.” She talked the owner of a car mechanic shop to let her copy it. She handed me a DVD. Popped it into my computer & watched. “Holy sh*t!” “I know, right!?” she said.

Here is the video the investigator Julia found that exposed Det. Bergman’s lie. Mr. Barbosa parallel parks. Unmarked car pulls up. He drives off. No accelerating back. No aiming car at Bergman (driver’s side). No diving out of way. A complete fabrication.

Here is another version of the video that exposed ex-NYPD detective Michael Bergman’s perjury.

@nowthisnews published it with a play by play rundown.

Armed with the video, I filed a motion to dismiss the charges comparing Bergman’s testimony with what actually happened (with time stamps) & submitted the motion along with a copy of the video surveillance. I got a call from the prosecutor less than a day later. He was stunned.

“I watched the video. Um.” He had a hard time finding words. “Well. We’re obviously going to dismiss.” I was so relieved. I’m so used to prosecutors giving cops every imaginable benefit of the doubt, I thought there was a chance they’d find a way to see something I couldn’t.

Then prosecutor asks me: “Why do you think he did this?” I told him I had no idea. But reminded him that police lie all the time. This one happened to be obvious bc it was on video. But cops lying unfortunately is an epidemic in forces around the country. I felt like a teacher.

The prosecutor also told me that the Brooklyn DA’s new “Police Accountability Unit” would be considering prosecuting. I said that was fine, but more pressing: his office should be investigating every case the detective ever worked on. “That’s out of my control, but I agree.”

I’ve never seen anyone smile more broadly than when I told Mr. Barbosa we found video, it totally exonerated him, & the prosecution was dismissing. He literally bounced. “I told you!” “I know.” “What happens now?” I soon found out. From the Daily News:

Det. Bergman, accused of lying under oath to imprison an innocent man for up to 15 years, was released w/o bail. No outcry of course from @nypost, police & prosecutors who, as I type, are peddling their own lies to kill new bail reforms so they can jail more Black & Brown people.

I later found out, this time from @nypost, that Bergman had pled guilty. The Post of course didn’t disparage Bergman as a “criminal,” “thug,” “goon,” “felon,” or “con” like they do Black people charged w/ far less. But they did call Mr. Barbosa “the perp.”

Bergman was fired. A near impossibility. Prosecutors asked the judge to sentence him to a year in jail. Brooklyn DA made this statement: “The justice system must be able to rely on the integrity & credibility of our police to keep our communities safe & ensure equal justice.”

Today I heard the news. The Judge took the rare step—at least in cases of people I represent—of undercutting the prosecution request for jail time & sentencing Michael Bergman to probation. As far as I know, this judge only sentences cops to probation. No matter what. Examples —>

The same judge also sentenced the 2 NYPD officers who had sex w/ a teen in exchange for her freedom to probation. Pointed out that cop's conduct was mitigated bc the teenager also committed a crime by allegedly offering sex for her freedom.

The same judge gave probation to this ex-NYPD cop who shot a man in the mouth twice out of jealousy & then placed a knife next to his body to cover up his crime. 

Akai Gurley (left) was killed by Officer Laing while walking in the stairwell of a building. Laing received probation.

2 months later, same judge sentenced Marcell Dockery (right), a teen who set fire to a mattress accidentally killing a responding officer, to 19 years to life.

Michael Bergman did one of the worst things a human being could ever do to another: give false testimony that would put them in jail wrongfully. He did so brazenly and maliciously. He lied in sworn testimony before a grand jury.

If investigators in my office had not found video that proved his lie, Mr. Barbosa faced a mandatory minimum of 3.5 years and a maximum of 15 years in prison. Police lying is an epidemic not just in the NYPD, but in police forces around the country.

Police lie because they know they’ll rarely if ever be held to account. It is a good thing Bergman was fired and prosecuted. But probation? I just hope that this punishment sends the necessary message of zero tolerance to all on the force. I fear it won’t.
