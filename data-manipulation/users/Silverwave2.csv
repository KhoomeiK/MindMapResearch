Whatcouldgowrong,ff71itx,t1_ff6qw6a,1579639270.0,"Yes the government did nothing by taking action. But your right let's take India's vast fortune that they just decided not to ever use and spend millions on a cop and five cameras in very car. And then with what's left over from their vast fortune the can audit the entire government because they have the money.

They need to follow the example of America and Britain, they use their money on so much security that crime is a thing of the past right?

But sarcasm about your utter stupidity regarding the cost of what your suggesting and India wealth, what you are suggesting is a police state. Where everything is watched and there is a cop to punish you the second you do something wrong. You bitch about freedom but then suggest a fucking police state as a solution. You are beyond arguing with because you just want to defend you point even if you contradict yourself"
Whatcouldgowrong,ff6qfe5,t1_ff6pp6e,1579632723.0,"So what I am getting from your argument, that train rape can't exist because you can ask for help. You are a dense mother fucker and I am not even going to waste my time continuing this conversation because you care more about your precious feelings than the safety of others that you have somehow deluded yourself in to thinking that you can't be raped on a crowded train."
Whatcouldgowrong,ff6q5pj,t1_ff6p91s,1579632562.0,"I never jumped to any conclusions, I asked you a question that you are refusing to answer. I will ask again, do you think people should be free to rape other people? 

The mere fact that you won't answer means you are willing to defend your point against all logic. The obvious answer is no, people should not be allowed to rape others and yes that means we take away their freedom to rape, but that's not a bad thing.

My next question, do you believe that segregation for the sake of safety is worse than doing nothing to prevent sexual assault? And before you whine again, no I am not jumping to the conclusion I am asking for your answer. But knowing you, you will go on another rant and continue to ignore logic. 

One last point of segregation, why are so upset about a women only train car, but you are not fighting against the segregation of bathrooms?"
Whatcouldgowrong,ff6ov9f,t1_ff6ofec,1579631791.0,"Yes, because anarchy, aka total freedom, is a bad thing. Do you think people should be free to rape others? Don't go on a rant about equality or freedom I want the your answer to that question. Do you think people should be free to rape others?"
Whatcouldgowrong,ff6no7t,t1_ff6738s,1579631070.0,"You do know that this was put into place to protect these women from rape right? So based on your old age wisdom if 100 people don't like the fact that these women are given a space where they can't be assured and arrested by men on the train then they should put the women back at risk of rape because it upsets some guys?.

And also it can be turned against you if half the population which are women and we will say a majority of the men don't want women to be raped does it make sense to lower the opportunity for these women to be raped because a hundred people don't want women to be raped so that's good enough reason to prevent it right?"
Whatcouldgowrong,ff6n8an,t1_ff688o7,1579630800.0,"If there was a men's only coach then yes. You can bitch about equality all you want but when they are forced to do something like this to lower the amount of rape, which the annual number is a five-figure number, then equality gets to go by the wayside to increase the safety of people who are being assaulted."

If she did not want to be punished she should not have bullied anyone it just so happens that she got caught around the time of prom and the punishment should still stand because she is old enough to know what she was doing. Losing something that is really important to her should show her how to behave in the future. 

You'll be like not arresting a person who harassed and assaulted somebody at the bar just because they have a a wedding to get to tomorrow. What they did was wrong and they still deserve punishment."
