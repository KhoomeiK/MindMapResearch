I quit playing pick up games at stores ~5 years ago because someone literally threatened to stab me in the store's parking lot because they thought a model I was playing with is too good. The game has annoyingly loose rules and encourages a chunk of the playing population to cheat and bully their way into winning. And thats not even going into the ""inoffensive"" behavior like screaming and yelling at random intervals, refusing to bathe, or blasting shitty music through your phone in the middle of a packed store where no one wants to hear it.

You'd probably be happier swapping them out for a third warsuit and downgrading the intercessor fist to a sword to squeeze in a third eliminator squad. I'd also consider swapping out the Phobos Librarian for a Phobos Captain then to hand out rerolls to your eliminators.

dresdenfiles,fczfgzs,t1_fczd5fj,1578100088.0,"Well my understanding is the reason most laws of magic are there because with magic you have to believe in what you're doing, and using magic to directly kill means you believe in murder which will twist you and lead you down a path to worse and worse stuff.

todayilearned,fcye7t4,t1_fcye3oj,1578078782.0, Well the whole idea is you find the worst traffic within a reasonable distance to join and if enough smart cars are on the road to form sufficient density they'll make a parking lot anywhere.
todayilearned,fcycwcr,t1_fcycqkd,1578078229.0,Yes I meant less in a technical sense and more in an infrastructure logistics sense since parking lots would have to support this.
dresdenfiles,fcybryd,t1_fcy72c2,1578077788.0,Maybe she died and came back and decided that the Black Council was doing the right thing in the big picture?

dresdenfiles,fcm4s0f,t3_ehkaci,1577764228.0,Storm Front and Fool Moon are very different than the rest of the series. Jim was just starting out and was leaning more into supernatural noir than the supernatural adventure that it ultimately turns into. Grave Peril has important plot implications so I'd still give it a go but Summer Knight is the first book where you get a real taste of his voice for the rest of the series (and the start of the consistently high quality he has maintained ever since). If you don't like Summer Knight you will hate Dresden Files as a whole and should give up there.

leagueoflegends,fdln7yt,t1_fdjltvi,1578527854.0,Yeah like this fucking dumbass Janna player.
saltierthancrait,fdlj0j1,t1_fdlirnu,1578525084.0,Well you could argue that the only way he got noticed was because he became the hero of the rebellion which put about as big of a target on his head as he could possibly get.
saltierthancrait,fdli4mp,t1_fdlgek9,1578524520.0,"TBF, basically no one except Obi-wan + Vader, the Emperor and sith acolytes know who Vader is. I.e. no one who could meet Luke and put 2+2 together."
killteam,fdlaqj1,t1_fdkzmr4,1578520035.0,That would look pretty weird considering he's sleeveless.
HobbyDrama,fdkyb6p,t1_fdhvwep,1578513663.0,"As someone who has played Warhammer on and off for almost 20 years (I feel so old saying this, I swear I'm not old) at this point... a decent percentage of Warhammer players are plainly sub-human.

I quit playing pick up games at stores ~5 years ago because someone literally threatened to stab me in the store's parking lot because they thought a model I was playing with is too good. The game has annoyingly loose rules and encourages a chunk of the playing population to cheat and bully their way into winning. And thats not even going into the ""inoffensive"" behavior like screaming and yelling at random intervals, refusing to bathe, or blasting shitty music through your phone in the middle of a packed store where no one wants to hear it.

Nowadays I only play with people I've known for a long time and can trust to behave like a functioning member of society."
leagueoflegends,fdkq3h8,t1_fdjvmar,1578508803.0,They're going to hand off the announcement work to Greeley who will wait until the deadline passes then give a disappointing announcement or defer further out.
WarhammerCompetitive,fdkomxy,t3_elo05g,1578507930.0,Death Company Intercessors unfortunately seem... not good. You'd probably be happier swapping them out for a third warsuit and downgrading the intercessor fist to a sword to squeeze in a third eliminator squad. I'd also consider swapping out the Phobos Librarian for a Phobos Captain then to hand out rerolls to your eliminators.
television,fdf4qfw,t1_fdf3y0p,1578353269.0,"Yeah, they need to pace events better IMO. It was all slow burn politics up until the last couple episodes then the remainder was a season's worth of action."

You are being incredibly obtuse here. Please stop."
WarhammerCompetitive,fdf3rf4,t1_fdf2ejm,1578352634.0,Where's the Death Company unit without black rage? Where's the space Marine model without angels of death? There's plenty of valid things to point out when complaining about Space Marine favoritism and you decided to intentionally misunderstand things to enhance your outrage.

movies,fdecav5,t1_fde8zfj,1578335900.0,Wasn't he effectively banned from one of the CW hero shows because the showrunner hated him? I guess it was Arrow based on the fact that you mentioned the other 2.
WarhammerCompetitive,fdea341,t1_fde2dl2,1578334508.0,"Yeah, its an (IMO) big nerf for Lemartes because he often wants to be chanting support Litanies over Hate and doesn't get to toolbox a bit now."
PraiseTheCameraMan,fde9h9w,t1_fde5pxj,1578334122.0,"It was super interesting when he went on Hot Ones and showed how he was a borderline blue collar football fan kind of regular guy.

dresdenfiles,fczfgzs,t1_fczd5fj,1578100088.0,"Well my understanding is the reason most laws of magic are there because with magic you have to believe in what you're doing, and using magic to directly kill means you believe in murder which will twist you and lead you down a path to worse and worse stuff. Believing that your power can break others' enchantments sidesteps the issue because Luccio isn't twisted in the forging of the sword."

todayilearned,fcye7t4,t1_fcye3oj,1578078782.0, Well the whole idea is you find the worst traffic within a reasonable distance to join and if enough smart cars are on the road to form sufficient density they'll make a parking lot anywhere.
todayilearned,fcycwcr,t1_fcycqkd,1578078229.0,Yes I meant less in a technical sense and more in an infrastructure logistics sense since parking lots would have to support this.
dresdenfiles,fcybryd,t1_fcy72c2,1578077788.0,Maybe she died and came back and decided that the Black Council was doing the right thing in the big picture? They have made a big emphasis on how you're such a big badass if you die and come back in the last few books and everyone talks about her as if she was a big badass.
todayilearned,fcyb60a,t1_fcxn7nz,1578077511.0,"Well this is clearly for dense urban zones - SF, LA, NY. The order of things for it to try would be as follows:

Try to go home to park.

Too far? Find free public parking.

No free parking? Find cheap paid parking (assuming it can be paid digitally by the car somehow)

Is that more expensive than finding the highest traffic zone around and joining it? Become one with the traffic hell parking lon."

dresdenfiles,fcm4s0f,t3_ehkaci,1577764228.0,Storm Front and Fool Moon are very different than the rest of the series. Jim was just starting out and was leaning more into supernatural noir than the supernatural adventure that it ultimately turns into. Grave Peril has important plot implications so I'd still give it a go but Summer Knight is the first book where you get a real taste of his voice for the rest of the series (and the start of the consistently high quality he has maintained ever since). If you don't like Summer Knight you will hate Dresden Files as a whole and should give up there.
thisismylifenow,fckn2q0,t1_fcjy5x2,1577728890.0,They were bred that way specifically to help them with herding. They're a working dog not a designer dog and their features are intentional.
WarhammerCompetitive,fcjgdg5,t1_fcjg1h0,1577686606.0,Yeah I'm personally leaning towards Mephiston over the dread but if you're willing to pay you can get parity in that aspect.
WarhammerCompetitive,fcj94df,t1_fcg9pmf,1577680352.0,"The dread can deny 2 with the base book relic or the +6"" range and reroll one cast/deny relic to bring it up to parity."

Grimdank,fbzl457,t1_fbzedz6,1577250367.0,"Contrast are terrible for Space Marines or anything with large flat surfaces. You just get weird pooling on your shins and kneepads which doesn't look good. It's amazing for fur, or organic materials like Tyranids.

TBH I've found the easiest way to get good quick Blood Angels if you're a mediocre painter like me is to prime / airbrush / basecoat mephiston red, and do a pass of nuln oil to matte things out and darken the crevices. Minor cleanup required if you go too thick and nuln pools in awkward spots."
