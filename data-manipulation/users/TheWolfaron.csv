Beastars,fcue88f,t3_ei5o3a,1577978873.0,"Gotta appreciate you editing the pic like that just so anime watchers wouldn't be spoiled. Even though I'm up to date with the manga, I thank you for being awesome."
Beastars,fcuduxd,t3_eihizl,1577978633.0,"Honestly, I'd pay to see that. No joke."
Beastars,fctntrq,t1_fctjp1j,1577950636.0,And I'm definitely okay with that.
gaming,fcryybq,t1_fcrbs0n,1577908639.0,"Well, they are all or almost all broken at least to some extent, I've played pretty much every Ubisoft game and not a single game have I been able to play for 30 minutes without running into at least two to three bugs... And I'm honestly sad to say that 'cause I've liked or even loved most of their games. But yeah, I do have to admit that saying they are almost always a broken mess is a pretty big exaggeration since most are still very much playable, so my bad on that one."
JhinMains,fcp7ons,t3_ef7llm,1577853226.0,"I just simply can't choose my favorite. They're all wonderful, and what I prefer changes depending on my mood at the time."
gaming,fcp6yh2,t3_eicc4l,1577852518.0,So glad to see the love for Oblivion living on.
gaming,fcp6n7u,t3_eict4f,1577852219.0,"Exactly. All of them are valid options and console wars etc are just silly and dumb things people have gotten way too invested in. 

But yeah, money is usually a pretty big issue."
gaming,fcp6bwx,t3_eibv4v,1577851912.0,"Ubisoft does make good games though, it's just a shame that they're almost always a broken mess at release."
gaming,fcp5voa,t3_ei8c29,1577851479.0,I need this pillow so badly.
gaming,fcp5u1g,t3_ei55vo,1577851433.0,"I really wish Ubisoft released a sequel for Steep or some other company made a similar game. It's already so good, but there's also so much potential for improvement there."
helpme,fcp4ihz,t3_eiaw9d,1577850214.0,I know exactly how you feel. I've been feeling the same thing for a while now.
offmychest,fcp3k7d,t3_eicw1v,1577849389.0,"I wish I was as smart as you a few years back, that was definitely a wise call on your part.

Also, now I really want to get a popcorn machine for myself."
offmychest,fcp2t6r,t3_eib05a,1577848735.0,"You most definitely have the right to be sad or even cry for someone's death, no matter if you know them personally or not. It just shows that you have a good caring heart within yourself."
offmychest,fcp2dxp,t1_fcp0zpv,1577848363.0,"I actually used to go to a therapist due to being depressed, but eventually he just told me ""I don't think you need any help, so we're stopping these sessions here"".

But yeah, thank you. I guess I just wanted someone to tell me that it's all me and not that things are actually like that."
offmychest,fcozz5w,t3_ehyc7q,1577846303.0,"I'm extremely saddened to hear all of that. I have 2 cats and they mean the world to me, and if this happened to my cats... I don't know how I would deal with this."
borderlands3,f3ed1a7,t1_f3eacx1,1570869877.0,Brick did this to me so many times while I was playing Zane...
