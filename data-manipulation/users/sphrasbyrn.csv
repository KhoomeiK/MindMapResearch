I'm trying to put myself more in your shoes but being in my own, I can say your mom chose the best of few and difficult options. No one is meant to withstand an information bomb like this, nevertheless the sudden stalkerish fear. You're as mature as you ever were now and your mom didn't want anything about your biodad to become normal to you. You know this is abnormal, depraved behavior and, again, looking in from the outside here, I think it's an at least optimally achieved view.

Every healing process hurts, physical and emotional and now you're emotionally 'scabbing over.'
