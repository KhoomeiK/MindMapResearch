HealthAnxiety,fff1i3y,t3_et9dqz,1579873116.0,"I just started back on it again Monday. I had success with it in the past, the only real side effects I experienced was heightened anxiety when first starting it and a lowered libido throughout. The latter is why I stopped the first time. Recently I weighed the pros and cons and decided I needed to back on it again because I was a mess. While I was on it my wife said I was noticeably happier and motivated as well. 

Remember everyone is different and this may not be your experience. Give the medicine at least a few weeks before quitting unless you’re in terrible pain or have any suicidal ideation. Keep in touch with your doctor with any concerns, that’s what they’re there for. Good luck, you got this."
HealthAnxiety,ffeaoes,t3_et5gqz,1579841428.0,Maybe a pinched nerve? Sounds weird but I had a small cyst on my earlobe removed and now whenever I scratch the area near my ear I can kinda feel it in my neck.
Cringetopia,ffddupr,t1_ffczacc,1579818802.0,"Seriously? If this dude was wearing a mega man shirt no one would care, but this dude is wearing a fucking BLASTER! You need to equate that to someone wearing a football helmet around the store. That’s the correct comparison and both are “cringe”."

Thanks for taking the time to reply. Made me feel a bit better. Also, good luck with your ENT appt, I know how that is since I’ve had severe sinus issues since I was a teenager."
HealthAnxiety,ff66orr,t1_ff64kyj,1579620428.0,Thank you the the reply and the reassurance.
todayilearned,ff4llis,t1_ff4lh68,1579566572.0,Fair enough but I only can speak on the US big 4.
todayilearned,ff4l8ky,t1_ff4kium,1579566327.0,"Different games completely. I’ve played hockey my whole life and the sport has evolved in skill more than any of the others IMO.

Go sixers!"
todayilearned,ff4hmg2,t1_ff4ha91,1579563823.0,Gotcha. Totally agree there.
todayilearned,ff4h0bf,t3_ergva0,1579563397.0,Also Wayne Gretzky is the only man Darrin Pfeiffer of Goldfinger fame would have sex with.
todayilearned,ff4gey8,t1_ff4da7a,1579562989.0,"Disagree. He’s be a good player, but players today have the advantage of learning from guys like him and the guys that learned from them. It will plateau at some point but the difference in skill and speed is seen easily between prime Gretzky and say prime Crosby."

sportsbook,ff3ijy6,t1_ff3et46,1579541791.0,Correct me if I’m wrong but red Gatorade seems way thicker than other colors. I’ve been playing sports 20 years and never use it for than reason. I always assumed that’s why they don’t in the NFL.
television,ff22vp3,t3_eqpmi4,1579492317.0,"Let’s see within 10 minutes they’ve hit us with:

-	trans character
-	9/11 survivor
-	cancer
-	PTSD
-	Learning disability
-	no health insurance

Nothing inherently wrong with any of this but good lord it’s 10 minutes in and they’ve managed to hit us with every political talking point in the US.

youseeingthisshit,fdhhqwq,t1_fdh50k2,1578422901.0,Sorry they guilt tripped me into participation which I didn’t mind but they were extremely pushy especially when I needed to back off for a bit.
youseeingthisshit,fdh3fxm,t1_fdgzq3z,1578414550.0,I wasn’t allowed until I basically told the nurses on my 3rd kid to fuck off. They tried so hard to guilt me into all this crazy shit. These nurses live for it.
PublicFreakout,fdeulbt,t1_fdeu931,1578346924.0,I have no problem with calling this woman out on her shitty behavior. I have an issue with the way we go about it now. Everyone in that place had a right to call her out. I just hate that now it’s recorded so the world can see it forever and can all call her fat or other tasteless shit collectively to make themselves feel better about their own lot in life.
malelivingspace,fdetmun,t1_fdeq4mc,1578346352.0,Like most social media platforms it’s used as a way to brag or bitch. Bragging in this case.
eagles,fdepnr1,t1_fde3wfp,1578344002.0,The thread I read yesterday and this morning all the top comments were calling it dirty.
PublicFreakout,fdeg9ma,t1_fdediu7,1578338374.0,See you’re making assumptions. This lady could’ve also been quiet as a church mouse normally. Maybe she’ll go home and feel terrible for her outburst and will call and apologize. Stop acting like you have the moral high ground and have never done anything out of character in your life. You’re just lucky no one was recording and posted that shit to the internet. If it happened to you I’m sure you’d be singing a different tune. The fact that we’re now justifying this shit and condemning people from a 10 second clip so we can all feel superior is more disgusting than this woman’s behavior.
HealthAnxiety,fdb9u8c,t3_ekhsa2,1578255265.0,My back is always like this. A lot of times it will be the same pain in the front too like it goes straight through. Super frustrating.
tifu,fdb63bo,t3_ekff1x,1578254226.0,Ultra religious types like that is such an alien concept to me. I grew up going to catholic school too and I’ve never met anyone like that. Most people are “Christians” growing up but not really practicing ones. So glad I didn’t have to deal with that shit. Feel bad for you OP.
HealthAnxiety,fda52jw,t1_fda4tgg,1578241790.0,Get yourself into therapy if possible. I also recommend meditation. It helps more than you think. There are apps like headspace that can help you get started.
HealthAnxiety,fd9sxot,t3_ekdb14,1578237678.0,I doubt anything will happen. But I should tell you only take it when you need it. It’s habit forming and you do not want a physical dependence on a benzodiazepine. Don’t want to fear monger because it does take prolonged use to develop one but it can be a slippery slope.

Anxiety,fcw9c1d,t1_fcv8xd3,1578020127.0,"It most likely will never be enough even if you had those extra 10 hours because you will still be miserable for 30. I work 3 days a week Tuesday to Thursday 7a-7p but get paid for 40. I make what people consider the amount of money to be “happy” and I’m still miserable. For me it’s because I still feel like a slave to the system. I don’t think I was made for this type of life, but I keep on chugging along because I have 3 kids and a wife who I love and need to provide for.

If you find your purpose and something that makes you happy that’s the only way that those 10 hours will matter. Good luck, life doesn’t tend to get easier for us unless you’re lucky and bust your ass with a specific goal in mind."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fcsazo2,t1_fcsafhq,1577914009.0,I won’t bother to nap that long cause it takes me at least that long to fall asleep. If I have time to nap it’s usually an hour.

Anxiety,fckmebq,t1_fckj70v,1577728481.0,If they worded it that way that’s not very constructive but there is something to be said about finding a purpose or something that keeps you motivated in life. These things can help with anxiety.
Anxiety,fckm710,t1_fckatrq,1577728356.0,They don’t dismiss your concerns for starters. Also you’re comfortable sharing your issues and when you do they can give you techniques to battle your issues. I guess compassion would be something that is important to me in a therapist.
sportsbook,fcklf4f,t1_fckko4x,1577727880.0,Pitching still is suspect but barring a significant injury they should be over.

My son had norovirus last year and was miserable and I felt so bad I said fuck it and hung out with with him so he would feel better which in turn gave me it. I wasn’t worried so much only cause I knew what I had and the duration. A cold is something else cause you’re not exactly sure it’s a cold. I’m ranting now but the point is you know it’s strep and you know how long it usually lasts. Just tell yourself you’re not in any danger and it so be over soon.

I show up to court to fight it and I sign in and this cop is the only name on the list and there’s like 30 cases from him alone for that day. He didn’t show up and I pleaded down to speeding and paid like $100 and I was on my way.
