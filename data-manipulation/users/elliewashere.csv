CPTSD,fg8g3cx,t1_fg8e9mh,1580618449.0,Thank you!! I’ll research it. Great idea.
CPTSD,fg7fnzi,t3_exak8v,1580591356.0,I think the nurse was saying that it was the right thing to get medical attention and that you should be aware of those symptoms in the future so that you can get help before you're at the point of attempting suicide. I'm really glad you had a good doctor and you have your boyfriend to be a good support system.
CPTSD,fg7eop9,t3_ex8e8z,1580590681.0,That's so so wonderful. I'm really glad.
CPTSD,fg7ehjc,t3_ex980z,1580590544.0,I'm very happy for you.
CPTSD,fg6z5q3,t1_fg6q7we,1580580250.0,"This is so, so helpful to me. It's a great idea to ask her if she has the space to deal with stuff. I have promised her I would always call medical people in a crisis, yeah. I need to build a support system outside of her in general. Also self-regulating is (obviously, since I have CPTSD) a great struggle for me, but I'm hoping that I can get back in therapy soon and maybe that will help. It gives me hope to know that other people have been through this and it's possible to heal the relationship. Thank you so much for sharing your story."
CPTSD,fg6p6pb,t1_fg6ny1h,1580573675.0,"It does help me to hear that. I think my sister and I developing better boundaries is key, and maybe things between us will get better over time. Thank you for sharing. It’s good to have hope."
CPTSD,fg6avkj,t3_ex2j9z,1580561899.0,"Pity your sister. She’s enmeshed and doesn’t know it. As someone who’s been that person and still struggles to find my way out of it with my parents even as an adult.... self sufficiency feels priceless to me. And very difficult because I‘ve had to develop the tools for it as an adult. I think you’re smart to be “the sane one,” to have made your own life. I can understand feeling resentment... but with my parents, all the money and smothering hasn’t made up for the emotional abandonment, either. If that’s true for your sister then the gestures from your parents are empty, and deep down she probably feels empty too. Be proud that you got out of that and are working on healing. That’s impressive to me."
CPTSD,fg6a416,t1_fg5la1g,1580561008.0,It’s a great idea and we have talked about it if we ever live in the same place again. But she’s across the country from me.
CPTSD,fg5j9wx,t3_eww4tr,1580528995.0,I'm glad that happened and I hope it was healing. Even though I agree with other people who've pointed out that you shouldn't have had to be strong all the time.
depression,ffib51m,t3_etqbpl,1579969668.0,people suck. you deserve better friends and i hope you find them.
librarians,ffdj8q9,t1_ffdf2v7,1579822032.0,Thank you very much!! I’ll do some exploring of the things you mentioned. I really appreciate the response. Not too late for my job search :).
CPTSD,ffawu6x,t1_ff8mnjx,1579746337.0,"omg, I feel like this about my car. my safe space."
CPTSD,ffawps7,t1_ff889ed,1579746255.0,I'm glad you're free and safe.
CPTSD,ffawn1d,t1_ff8329g,1579746205.0,This makes me so happy for you. I'm glad to read this tonight.
CPTSD,ffawj81,t3_esju8e,1579746133.0,"I just had this experience with my last counselor too. Very different from the psychologist I saw before that. I think the key is finding someone trauma informed, yes. But finding the right person is SO HARD."
depression,ffavqbm,t3_esiwop,1579745601.0,I feel this post so much. Sugar = dopamine rush = less depressed and then there's the crash and it's awful but it's a never-ending cycle. I can't get myself to work out and I have anxiety about it because there are hereditary heart problems in my family. It's a hard battle.
rape,ffao4h3,t1_ffagxq5,1579740520.0,"I'm so sorry you don't have people. But also very glad you had your grandparents, and that you have your husband. The isolation of depression makes it extra hard. I hope telling your story helps bring you a little peace."
rape,ff86ii4,t1_ff7wxvv,1579667373.0,"How anyone could not convict such a horrible person as this guy blows my mind. But separately from convicting him... You were so smart about it. That's what I kept thinking as I read this. Already at the beginning of the story you were doing the smart things psychologists would tell you to do in a survival situation: comply to survive, get the kidnapper to see you as a person, prepare yourself emotionally as best you can. That's incredible that you were able to think about these things and do what you needed to do.

It is heartbreaking that you think of yourself, as you said, as a ""worthless person."" You are clearly incredibly brave and capable. And you're \*still here.\* That seems huge to me. I'm a person who struggles with depression even with most things going great in my life, while you've been through this terrible ordeal and you're here to write about it. That says a lot to me about who you are.

I hope you have people in your ""real life"" off the internet who can see how amazing you are."
rape,ff7uhck,t1_fevklk6,1579658657.0,THIIIIIIS.
Anxiety,ff7tm94,t1_ff6zap6,1579658063.0,u/Daemontech I do the sugar thing too. awful habit but that dopamine rush can't be beat.
Anxiety,ff7tjd3,t3_ervufa,1579658007.0,"I call a family member to talk about it, sometimes. If it's not too bad I distract myself by reading something fun. I listen to music and sing along to distract myself while I clean; doing the dishes or scrubbing the kitchen counter helps. Or organizing my closet. I take my ativan, two if it's an emergency. Sometimes I try the four counts in five counts out breaths that a therapist taught me. Or take a deep breath and scan my body for the signs of tension - jaw clenching, tight muscles, fidgeting - and I try to relax all of it. When I feel up to it and the weather is good, taking long walks to music really helps. Yoga, when I used to do it, helped. (The energetic kind, vinyasa.) Sometimes cooking is soothing if I know a recipe well."
Anxiety,ff7sypi,t3_es40ez,1579657607.0,I'm so sorry. I hope you're able to spend time with them both and that you have a good support system. How lovely that your dad feels like he can talk to you honestly.
CPTSD,ff34ias,t1_ff26ako,1579533468.0,Sounds like we're in similar places in life. I empathize. And hoping things will eventually get better for both of us.
CPTSD,ff26drx,t1_ff24ee8,1579495091.0,"\*Raises hand\* Hi, fellow childhood emotional neglect sufferers. Just wanted to chime in to say you're not alone. Thanks for bringing it up."
CPTSD,ff2645a,t1_ff1wpgg,1579494867.0,This was also my experience of graduate school and was super frustrating. Makes it hard to get a job in my field. Did you stay in your field after grad school? Did things get better? ...Living vicariously since I graduated pretty recently.
depression,feuk9ve,t3_eqjkri,1579387289.0,"High school was NOT the best years of your life. Trust me. Everything after high school is better. Life is long and this is just 4 years of it that soon won't matter. A lot of people who were depressed in high school learn coping mechanisms, find better friends, become more comfortable in their own skin... even me, and I was exactly where you are when I was 17. Now I'm 30 and even though I sometimes struggle with my mental health, I have a lot more hope about life than I did then. Hang in there."
Anxiety,fepo694,t1_fenyj5a,1579325830.0,"Academic and public can be very different, and everyone reacts to reference questions differently, so give it a chance and see how you feel. As for bringing up your anxiety... I've done it in several work situations and I don't recommend it. No one needs to know as long as you're able to do the job. You never know how people will react. Thanks for your encouragement; I hope you find the right space for you, too."
Anxiety,fenrc12,t1_fenimx5,1579289688.0,"Hey u/eleomena, sure no problem. So I worked at the reference desk where people could come up and ask you questions, like ""I need a book on 19th century archaeology,"" and you had to find the right database in the library website, then use the right keywords to give them some options, then help them track down the book in the stacks. The triggers were a combination of things: having hundreds of databases on different subjects to chose from, and not remembering which was for best for what question; being under a time limit with a sometimes-annoyed patron waiting for the right answer; not always knowing from their question what keywords to use, so my search wasn't accurate. In library school they train you to ""interview"" the patron to find out details about what they need so your search is easier, but I would freeze up and not know what to ask them. When your mind goes blank with panic just by someone walking up, all the research steps become almost impossible to fumble through.

2 contrasting stories:

1. in my previous work at libraries checking in and out items, it was lower pressure and I was ultimately fine. In the beginning, I carefully wrote down and learned each step of the process and then had bosses who were okay with my learning curve. I also had no problem shelving (solitary) or doing admin stuff on the computer (also solitary).

2. At a corporate research job where I could do extensive database research on my own and then come to the client with answers in more time, I excelled. So I know the time pressure was a big part of the problem. I also have anxiety about timed tests.

I hope that helps. Not all library jobs are reference librarian jobs."
HPfanfiction,fen3gq0,t1_fen0ec8,1579276132.0,I would too!
ptsd,fel4mqb,t3_ellqg8,1579213955.0,"Hey, I just wanted to say that I'm listening and I'm so sorry everything is hard. From reading your explanation it seems like you're being really hard on yourself. You're not a monster. You're responding in a normal way to abnormal stuff, like your mom being sick. You're still here and you have this relationship with your mom even though it's hard. It seems important to you that you're there for her, and it sounds like you are even when you're going through a lot yourself, which to me sounds like strength and kindness and compassion, even when it doesn't feel like it to you. It's okay to be ""really losing it"" right now; you don't have the mental energy for ""every single healthy thing,"" and no one should expect you to while your mom is sick. I hope your therapist is a good support system and I'm glad they're reminding you that you're doing the best you can."
CPTSD,fehdoi4,t3_ep5yzm,1579114413.0,"Thanks for sharing this. I love her smart, kind perspective on trauma and self-worth."
CPTSD,fefzem6,t3_eouep4,1579070493.0,I'm listening and I hope you can get to a safe place soon. Rooting for you too.
Anxiety,fecmpgb,t1_fecckat,1578977740.0,Thank you! Your encouragement makes me feel less alone.
