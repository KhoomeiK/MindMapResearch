suggestmeabook,ff7vfe3,t3_ersr97,1579659288.0,The Testing. It's sooooo good. The first two chapters are really slow but after that it picks up and is just incredible. The main character Cia is smart and likeable and the fourth test (the main part of the book) is very hunger games vibes.
femalehairadvice,ff7umlh,t3_eryvpm,1579658755.0,No bangs.

Abortiondebate,ff61ujh,t1_ff5dijv,1579616995.0,Ok?? So how does the right to life of a fetus trump the woman carrying its right of body autonomy?
Abortiondebate,ff592bm,t1_ff37u16,1579583892.0,No it's not. There is not the guarantee that the woman hosting the body is ready to carry the fetus to full term.
Abortiondebate,ff2yt86,t1_ff2em6p,1579528949.0,Ya.. a stage were it has the POTENTIAL to be a human. It's like saying that a horse with a foetus has a baby horse inside it

Thetruthishere,fewl81a,t3_eqljzw,1579413361.0,"“Good” and “bad” are not black and white. It is also subjective. Take for example Penn Bradgley’s Joe Goldberg. He has good qualities. He is loyal, protective and smart. He is also a killer."

unpopularopinion,fepnqtg,t3_eq992y,1579325455.0,There is a time and place to swear though. Like dropping the f bomb in front of a bunch of little kids and their families is really disrespectful to them in my mind.
unpopularopinion,fepnnhq,t1_feozstn,1579325379.0,It depends. When I think of someone who swears I think of the high school drop out kid who is high all the time who says a swear word every other word

AmItheAsshole,femwvd9,t1_femwol1,1579271712.0,I would make sure that the kid ends up in a good home where the parents will be able to handle them. I wouldn't be tossing the kid out onto the street. The dedication and work it takes to raise a special needs childish not the lifestyle for me.

My problem with the feminist movement is not having equal pay and job opportunities. My issue is when men are treated like shit and everything they do is apparently degrading (ex. Acting like a gentleman on a date, offering to pick up the check, etc.)"
highschool,fejswcc,t1_feizghu,1579185043.0,Oh I would be so screwed if that was my school. I see 5 different doctors so I think I've missed probably 50 classes just this year

highschool,feckr0u,t1_fec4eyc,1578976314.0,I am in Alberta Canada actually haha. That's really good to know. Would you say that grade 11 courses are more difficult than grade 10?
highschool,feckmt6,t1_fecdy14,1578976229.0,I average upper 80s. Is that high enough?
highschool,fec4wa0,t3_emqn98,1578966693.0,Talk to your teacher. Tell her that you're doing your best but are struggling. If they are anything like my teachers they will work with you and help you succeed.
highschool,fec4gji,t3_enswfl,1578966512.0,It gets better. Focus on your academics and the rest will follow. This sounds kinda mean but what I did when my popular friends and guys dropped me was think about how they will not be as successful in college. Just because they are popular does not mean they can overpower you. NEVER think they are better than you.
