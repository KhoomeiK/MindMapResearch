There is propaganda that overblows traditional medicine as well as prejudice that dismisses traditional medicine as having no value. As an aside, I am working on western style testing of traditional Chinese medicine “decoction” type treatments. (See note below) Some are effective and will be integrated into western pill or injection type medicines. However, lots are effective in their herbal tea state and CHEAP. In a poor country the importance of affordability of medicine can’t be overstressed.
 
Edit: the research is funded by the Chinese govt and takes place at Chinese hospitals by the way. I could name specific grants and hospitals if it helps."
science,ffi7kqd,t1_ffi4hm0,1579967168.0,"For using TCM along with normal treatment, in the article you linked, this is because tcm is used for SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENT ONLY— like eating ginger for an upset stomach. This is something we do in the west! Chinese people call drinking ginger tea “traditional Chinese medicine,” and it is. Another example is traditional Chinese medicine is used to rehydrate a patient. Again, it’s just tea, but it works, and it was invented in China. What’s your problem?"

Patently false... why do we see them all wearing surgical masks then? what do you think Chinese hospitals are? These are all western medicine style hospitals. We are seeing them on tv, full of patients. No one is trying to control this disease with traditional Chinese medicine vs quarantine and normal medical practice."
