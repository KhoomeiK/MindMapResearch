I never said, “you probably mean this,” thus changing the meaning of your words.

> In 2018, the ratio of women’s to men’s median weekly full-time earnings was 81.1 percent, a decrease of 0.7 percent since 2017, when the ratio was 81.8 percent, leaving a wage gap of 18.9 percent, compared with 18.1 percent in 2016. Women’s median weekly earnings for full-time work were $789 in 2018 compared with $973 for men. Adjusting for inflation, women’s median earnings stayed unchanged compared with the previous year; men’s earnings increased by 0.9 percent since 2017.1

They simply compare the median of two group and conclude there is a wage gap. For the love of god. Always the same BS over and over. How do you control your variables? How do you know it is due to the sex and not any other variable?
