That reason is that these are kids going through a lot of changes and facing new situations with no idea how to healthily deal with them and thus to a lot of people it would seem that it’s normal that many kids would be fairly angsty and uncomfortable at this point in their lives and that they just have to work past it. In fact, I believe this is the case more commonly and it’s why actual depression from younger kids tends to be ignored."
