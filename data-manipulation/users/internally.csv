ADHD,ffp0ej8,t3_eucvkm,1580083987.0,"I am right now LOL. I have such a wonderful life right now below of this XDXDXD!!! I don't cry everyday about my issues at all and don't feel trauma from the bullying I face from my motor skills or slow processing mechanisms (truth be told I also can't function because the kind heart I put out in place of being dumb gets crushed and gets taken advantage of easily)! I also enjoy feeling like a child because I can't concentrate easily, play games, or participate in collaborative sports as others do because I am a tad slower and get lost and lose things easily. I don't feel humiliated at work for asking for help and getting hopeless looks on other people's faces. I have a fantastic life being stupid, clumsy, and emotionless.

Fuck me."
nyc,ffgu3hg,t1_ffgp2pi,1579915092.0,That's actually quite interesting. Do you plan on staying in the Heights for much longer or nah?
Kingdom,ffduxp1,t1_ffcb5tx,1579829553.0,My new jam.
nyc,ffbbemr,t1_ffas1yh,1579758453.0,"Haha yes, we must be neighbors!"
nyc,ffbatp7,t1_ff98l67,1579757831.0,"I had bedbugs once when I was a teenager and I still dream of them sometimes. It was that awful. I feel itchy right now, great."
college,ffb4i4t,t3_esl9zc,1579751574.0,"Congratulations! I hope the best for you on your educational journey. Keep working hard and most importantly, socialize and network with people who will be proud of you and your achievements! Keep them close and rise with them."
cscareerquestions,ff88enh,t1_ff6p8be,1579668994.0,"I mean, it can be both. I remember when I started work and my work performance was bad. (My excuse is my ADHD which I plan on getting medication for soon) As a result, my workers ridiculed me for a while, and that depleted my hope for a while. The problem mainly revolved around a lack of proper communication though, and the fact that we're all the same age group and aren't fully matured yet."
ADHD,ff5an8q,t1_ff2xnpm,1579585377.0,"I do this as well. I am a fucking weirdo by myself. Have been ever since I was a teenager. I have never been able to show my true self to others.. sometimes it feels like a bomb is ticking, waiting to be released, but I hide my full self because the implosion might come out to strong.

But! It doesn't mean I don't try. Just something to get used to, as hard as it is to flourish from our shells... and I hate it.

You could consider yourself your best friend if you want to, because you know yourself best! I feel the same about me."
notits,ff57sga,t3_erpch6,1579582737.0,You have done some great work.

AskReddit,feocfwp,t1_fen2dq4,1579298179.0,"Give me a job where I can live off enough money to live comfortably at minimum, live close enough for a decent commute, actually feel happy and feel like I'm progressing when I'm there, and where decent food is accessible in the area if I can't cook on my own. Then it's worth it."
EngineeringStudents,felt78x,t1_felfbog,1579230331.0,What do you mean by empathy? Because I don't see a lack of that.
AskMenOver30,febebpl,t1_fe9qam6,1578957972.0,Just went through half a codecademy course for JS and feel like I should have done this instead lol.
depression,fe6llpk,t1_fe6jxvw,1578895013.0,No it's okay. Just knowing I'm not alone is actually sufficient for me. Thank you and hope you can manage it better.

depression,fdpqn9r,t1_fdpq8st,1578636827.0,Yes.  I didn't know I would have such a large audience but this is applicable to everyone suffering.
depression,fdpiz64,t1_fdpcp7l,1578629899.0,"It's bad but I think I feel the same way. When I cry these days I feel like it's all coming out of me but not processing. I feel like I listen but don't consume, and I just don't remember anything these days. It's weird, like I know I used to have panic attacks all the time and would act violently when I was isolated but the emotions that went with it, the things I actually did in that time period... it all escapes me."
depression,fdo0mbi,t1_fdmvkby,1578596665.0,"I really hope you heal from the pain of it all. I'm trying my next but often hate every step of the way. It truly feels like my friends were dumping their lives and problems on me always, on top of other stuff I experienced like poverty and mental illness.. I think back and look now and realize I do have some embedded trust issues because of past mistakes. I... )):: I don't even know who I am anymore."
depression,fdnvwvt,t1_fdn9spe,1578593923.0,"Yeah I do have a therapist but one of my problems is that I have been extremely busy recently, but at the same time I don't have a support system right now and visiting her is actually time consuming for me. It's been very easy to just give up. On top of the fact that I have mental disorders that make it hard to concentrate but I don't have access to medication right now. So all I can do is diet."
depression,fdnolln,t1_fdngos7,1578590009.0,"I try to talk to people but I am convinced people really dislike me, especially because no one really asks to hangout with me and they are never up to doing it lol. There is some great advice here regarding that though, but it's not really easy because this is an entire mindset one must change over months and months, on top of the actions we have to take too."
depression,fdnkddo,t1_fdniqnl,1578587628.0,I agree. I began to cry reading a lot of them.
depression,fdmzrxl,t1_fdmz4cr,1578572732.0,"This is kind of impossible. The more I put myself out there, the more I'm exposed to people more experienced than me. But this is probably for the best."
depression,fdm61ww,t1_fdm5qt2,1578540672.0,I will do my best!! I am looking forward to getting medication immediately.
depression,fdm598g,t1_fdm4w6o,1578540114.0,"Wow, that is extremely similar to my current situation actually. Also thank you for giving me some optimism about my brain too. I'll look into neurogenesis on my own time."
depression,fdm4tzc,t1_fdlzioy,1578539821.0,"how old are you right now? please try to do extracurricular activities and focus on your education as much as possible. just try something. put the energy of your emotions into your work. that is my biggest regret... not exploring more options. i'm in compsci now and think that some of the tools i could have learned back then would be applicable now to make apps today. of course literally absolutely everything im saying is easier said than done but i promise you it helps to build a work ethic. think about what you can do now for the future. for tomorrow's you! just think, do you want who you are today to be the person you are in five years from now? or do you want to be a better version of you? take care."
depression,fdm41iy,t1_fdlxekv,1578539286.0,"I have so much to say to everyone but thank you for the wise words. I read everything. I'm so happy it got better for someone. And it's true, university can be very  mmmmff.."
depression,fdm3tx1,t1_fdm13is,1578539144.0,"Don't remind me, please. I am 100% positive that having depression for as long as I have had it is the reason why I can't even do some tasks the way I wish I could. Every time I remember I'm not doing a task the most effectively because I physically feel like I cannot grasp onto it or onto a given task, I look back at my past and wnat to die."
depression,fdm12ym,t1_fdlymlm,1578537292.0,"I'm glad you stumbled upon this, as well as others who wanted to write a similar post. Feel free to vent all you want."
depression,fdlyi4e,t1_fdlxphc,1578535532.0,"Oh my god me too. I truly thought I would have been dead by now as a teenager. Everyday I would count the day until I would decide to die. I would think about what I would like to donate occasionally because I thought I didn't want to live in a world as torturous as this one if you will. Not even because of my pain in life but the part of the city I live in... Everyone is so sad looking, many crack addicts and such, old ladies who are near their deathbeds, but I was so depressed and anxious the only people I could help were my friends. I feel so sick that I didn't take any other initiatives but what can I do but look forward right? I didn't think I would ever become normal either, but if this is what normal is, then..."
depression,fdlxelm,t1_fdluy9m,1578534788.0,"Oh god, I hope for the best! I am still young and don't really consume alcohol so I can't really console you, but I can only imagine the pain you are going through right now. I'm not sure if it is at your level but what I can say is that I definitely feel like I have lost a part of myself due to mental disorders, too. Of course if I am an adult, I won't be the same person I was when I was ten or so, but I truly felt like I have shed the skin of the person I was a mere two years ago, seven years ago, ten years ago... I am so saddened by it lol."
depression,fdlt5e7,t1_fdlps41,1578531883.0,I was the same way in elementary school and middle school. I didn't start having suicidal thoughts until I was 11 or 12. I feel very unsettled with myself because I used to be known as a gifted kid but since I had really bad anxiety I didn't allow anyone to embrace it. I would be given opportunities to speak in front of crowds and I didn't take it. To join brilliant programs and I would make huge fusses about it. I didn't have the full capacity to realize the path they would have taken me down.
depression,fdlsgfl,t1_fdlomkb,1578531415.0,Thank you very much. I hope I can carry these words with me into the future.

manga,fd7iqdf,t3_ek7k5i,1578205182.0,"Read Glass Mask. Best shoujo ever written without these tropes. HOWEVER there is a predatory relationship in it, but it isn't like... that gross. You actually grow fond of their relationship, lol, but that's just me. If you know the names of these josei, please tell us (so I can actively avoid or probe them)."
trippinthroughtime,fd3rbk3,t1_fd3c2sy,1578161036.0,I know that but it doesn't make the trope any less annoying.
trippinthroughtime,fd0u08b,t3_ejln71,1578123740.0,We need to obliterate this trope.
