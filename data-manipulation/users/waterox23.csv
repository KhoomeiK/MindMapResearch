Kingdom,ffiw0l1,t1_ffirlvb,1579984055.0,How is it historical spoiler when it already happened in the manga? Did you even read what I posted? You are boasting that you can’t read.
YouOnLifetime,ffivstu,t1_ffir079,1579983904.0,Except my wife and I’m perfectly happy with that. I spent enough dating time with you basic bitches to last a life time.

Kingdom,ffioe87,t1_ffio4jv,1579978722.0,You’re stupid as shit. I’m making a case that kingdom cannot be spoiled because the author does not follow history. Pretty much every thing in Kingdom is MADE UP!
Kingdom,ffid2km,t1_ffhxllm,1579970988.0,"“Qiang Lei (Kou Kai), like Xin, was a pretty unknown general of their era. Nothing much was mentioned about him(yes him, will explain about this later) in ShiJi. His name only appeared a total of 2 times in ShiJi during the invasion of Zhao in the unification war...”

So with the exception of Zhao invasion, 500+ chapters of Koukai involvements with HSU are fabricated. The author just randomly picked the least known character and made him more bad ass in Kingdom manga universe.

Not even Wikipedia has a hit on Qiang Lei lol"

Kingdom,ffguv66,t1_ffglg0m,1579915653.0,Kingdom is literal inaccuracy of history. Don’t listen to historical morons and their predictions. Take it with a grain of salt because they are always wrong.
Kingdom,ffgu8ia,t1_ffgl2pd,1579915194.0,"No historical record of death for Koukai’s real life character. What you experienced is death flags raised by the author through his manga. Nobody can accurately spoil Koukai’s death for you, unless it’s the author."

YouOnLifetime,ff7rvbd,t1_ff78d8b,1579656849.0,Please. We all could feel your thirst from the first post. It makes sense that a middle age woman uses “Omfg”. You sound like a thirsty teenage girl.
YouOnLifetime,ff76vg5,t1_ff74gv7,1579642290.0,"Did you really watch the show and purposefully ignored all the red flags? Beck saw the signs before the last episode but she ignored them until it was too late. 

You’re literally wishing you were in Beck’s shoes before she discovered the real Joe. Put yourself in Beck’s shoes and rewatch the show.

Go out to the real world and have a real relationship. I hope you don’t bring whatever perfect boyfriend image that you created and apply it to your bf."
YouOnLifetime,ff6mttl,t1_fey6sb8,1579630557.0,"You want the cake without the work. Guess why Joe was tentatively in tune with Beck’s needs? Because he stalked, monitored, predicted, and dictated every move Beck made.

YouOnLifetime,fex5jb4,t1_fewpk92,1579424791.0,"For the record, I didn’t down vote you but I need to raise a point. I think you omitted to put that Joe, or there actor who plays him, is a handsome man. I think you’re trying to say that you’re willing to live with a psychotic, invasive, fake boyfriend just because he’s good looking.

Just put yourself in Beck’s shoe for a second the moment she discovered the truth about Joe. You just realized he stalked you for a very long time, stole things from your apartment, killed your best friends, manipulated you into his arms, etc... you may realize by now that death was always there, stalking you, manipulated its way to your door step, and now it’s here. Death is skin distance from you. How would you feel?

Or imagine your most beloved person turns out to be a serial killer or a criminal. How would you feel if you just discovered your parents monitored your every moves, killed your best friends because they were deemed as bad influence, every good/bad events in your life was dictated by them, and now you are exactly where they want you to be?"
