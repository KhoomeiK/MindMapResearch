4chan,ffgmmsi,t1_ffgm1e9,1579909766.0,Joe definitely got a little Carlin in 'im.
4chan,ffgkl8f,t1_ffgbhx4,1579908384.0,"Are they ""jokes"" or are they a free-form narrative of cultural observations, impressions and lampoons combined with ""buff-mime?""

Joe's not really a joke teller. More of a social critic. He's basically low-key heckling the audience the whole time. That's his schtick. Which is why he loves when somebody tries to heckle *him*...

But I think that's part of why a lot of people don't like his comedy. His attitude may come off as condescending and aggressive. He tries to be self depricating but if he rubs you the wrong way that might not seem sincere."
4chan,ffg92pr,t3_etaib0,1579901096.0,"He's a top tier comedian. As far as I'm concerned Rogan ranks right under Chappelle, Bill Burr and Louis CK as one of the most important contemporary comics.

Joe tries to incorporate his perspective and physicality into his shows in a way that is entertaining and provocative. He may not be terribly eloquent, but he's a strong performer with a polished act."

unpopularopinion,ffg5n3i,t3_et9jbh,1579898975.0,"Weeaboo is a bugaboo. Everybody likes aspects of Japanese culture.

Its very refined... and its also unapologetically ritualist, hierarchic, racist and fatalistic. It looks cool and giveth no fucks. There's something for everyone!"
skeptic,ffg0tsg,t1_fffzyf1,1579896010.0,So neurobiology is no longer a component of human behavior? That sounds significant. Someone should alert science...
Existentialism,fffybv7,t3_etb0vy,1579894471.0,"Its all rape. A woman doesn't choose to want a child, its a socio-biological imperative that either does or doesn't overpower the individual desire for autonomy and equity. Choice is illusory."

100% of beings return to ""non-being."" That's an abysmal retention rate..."

todayilearned,fffu7wb,t3_eta49l,1579891897.0,Check out the big brain on Rhazes.
mildlyinteresting,fffu0n7,t3_etc3ao,1579891774.0,"Does a ""geodude"" look like a blob with arms? I don't know how long ""geodudes"" have been around, but I'm betting overhead lighting and primates have been around longer.

So ""geodudes"" look like ape shadows, not the other way 'round."
skeptic,fffrmy5,t3_etc1ik,1579890303.0,">*“I feel so much more liberated on the inside that I can speak my truth clearly, stand in my power and not feel overtaken by emotion, my mind, and I feel free inside myself to just be,”* (she said after the alien ghost invaded her flesh...)

This is a sex thing. Humans have physical reactions to psychological states. The ""Dr."" is just making her brainstem beg for the D. This makes sense biologically since even if she were badly brain damaged she could still hump."
holdmyfries,fffpp7w,t3_et7pbx,1579889105.0,"This isn't autistic/mental/psycho

This is a perfectly reasonable reaction to someone who thinks they can do anything just because they wave some money around from someone that doesn't want to be bothered and isn't being financially extorted.

He invaded her personal space and he got blasted. Duh... What the fuck was he expecting?"
holdmyfries,fffozv5,t1_fffapn5,1579888668.0,"""Mental outbursts""

The guy is trying to exploit her for views by assuming people are dumb enough to put up with anything for money.

She just told him to fuck off in esperanto and went about her business uninterrupted *and* gave him some material for his channel with practically zero effort. Its genius if you've got the pipes."
