AskRedditAfterDark,ffw3kbi,t3_evd6xn,1580282794.0,"People have mostly been giving you jokey answers, but from the quite *intellectual* conversations I've had with multiple people, I've *came* to a conclusion.

* ""It's just a joke / pickup line"" Yes, a lot of them are ""pickup lines"" or jokes that are meant to use wordplay to what I can only assume would be... make someone laugh. Success rate is small, but the purpose of it is mainly just an attempt to create comedic relief.
* It's (doing it poorly, but it's still doing it) a call to action. Like ""hey, do you want to... you know?"" Does it work, not really, same with the joke, it's not really meant to be effective, and most people will get more offput than attracted, but to each their own.
* There's more probable answers however. You probably don't want jizz in your coffee, I can't imagine many people that do. But in porn, there is a lot of categories that focus cum. There's catagories of porn where women jerk guys off into food such as fries (like ketchup?) or in empty glasses, or even (yep) coffee. And sometimes the women drink it or eat it. It's the same reason some women swallow, to please their S.O and maybe (but I doubt it, but also I don't know maybe) because of the taste. That has weird connections with swallowing as a whole, its a ""yeah, drink that"" thing, that while can be seperate, isn't a binary thing, you can drink it by itself, or also with coffee. ""haha just kidding... unless?""
* Furthermore in bukkake there's cum that's put into cups or bowls and than drank normally, like its casual, so presumably jizzing in coffee is a similar line of kink. Its the consumption of jizz that's appealing to some. Doesn't specifically have to be in coffee, admittedly it is a liquid, and so too is cum. Until it's not. Maybe ice-coffee? I assume it has a better chance of working if its not hot. Hot liquid tends to harden or shrivel cum.
* The coffee cup is really interesting though, because there is some reasons as to why the coffee cup would be used. Coffee cups are mostly non-transparent. The cup is transportable, and doesn't *arrouse* suspicion. Therefor, anywhere its drank (in public for instance) can be done in anonymity, while still having that ""doing naughty things in public"" spice."

In 2017 people thought it was bad, and in 2018, they thought it was worse. In 2019 people claimed it was a dumpster fire and that 2020 would end the chaos.

Some people aren't just mean because they're mean, it's more complicated than that and breaking that chain is hard.
