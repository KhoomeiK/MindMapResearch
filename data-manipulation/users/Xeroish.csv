ViMains,ffkzhgx,t3_ettlts,1580032013.0,Triforce -> steraks -> rav hydra/titanic hydra -> blade of the ruined kind -> Deaths dance/frozen mallet. Gives you insane hp/ad/attack speed. Lets you shred tanks and 1v1. I run lethal tempo as well. Blade of the ruined kind and the DD/frozen mallet are changeable depending on what you need. If you need a Last whisper you have room for it. If you need rage blade you have room for it. If you need merc skimitar you have room for it. Its a build Im theory crafting atm thats supposed to let you 1v1/teamfight and be a pseudo tank as well. You can PM me if you want more info on it.

ViMains,fdof5vg,t1_fdoctpg,1578603945.0,"Yeah thats why this build gets so much early game hp. Its not really that squishy honestly. I play her more as a pseudo tank with all the hp you get. And yeah the life steal helps survive but also in case they get thorn mail. I also run lethal tempo which just excels at killing tanks and squishies alike. YOu could run 1/2 damage items but I think playing vi as a tank is the wrong move. Play a tank if you want a tank. You could also go something like Black cleaver instead of triforce if you want more tankyness. And maybe swap out 5th item for like a frozen heart or w.e other tank item you need. This is mostly a tank busting build with sustained damage but also enough ad to burst squishy. at 30 minutes and full build you'd have around 439 ad with the lowest ad items my tier list has which is more tehn enough to 100-0 a squishy and gives you enough defensive stats to fight tanks and not be mowed down by their backline. Steraks is the main focus of that tankiness cause with out you'd be fucked. Im also theory crafting a tear build which you may like more as you're tanking but still get a fuck ton of ad but its less anti tank just cause i dont get bork or LW with it. But you do have black cleaver so it kind of evens out. So if you wanted try and find a build you like that gives you 1/2 damage items and then rest tank. Id def try and work in trifroce/steraks cause its such a great combo and gives you all the stats vi needs. Other then that play around with items in the top lane and find what works for you. I just find my tier list to be effect at countering not only my lane opponent but their team as well as it gives such versatility and ""flow"""

You absoluting shit on tanks with this build. also you can swap stuff out. I use a ""tier"" system so items like balde of the ruined king can be swapped for last whisper, rage blade, wit's end. YOu end up with about 3.1k-3.8k hp based on items bought 370-449 ad, 1.4 attack speed blade passive. I havnt tried W max yes but I think ima try W max after Q max ive been doing Q-e-w max but ima try Q-W-E. I can get you a pic of my item set if you want it.
