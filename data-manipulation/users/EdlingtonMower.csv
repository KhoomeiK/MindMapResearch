I do try and stay aware of it, because it must *hurt* to feel even slightly suspected of that kind of motivation.

Tbh in the daycare thing I just wouldn't let any security work there alone, if it was considered a risk. Or would beef up security cams or something. I dunno, I expect they thought it through better than me."

AmItheAsshole,fflhdu0,t3_etvewp,1580039660.0,"NTA. 

In future, I would probably not offer to share films like this with your mom. 

Plus, as a general bit of life advice, try not to add in the effort of dealing with accidents (like the subtitles) in the 'equation' of how well you expect the rest of a situation to go. Like, people aren't more obliged to enjoy your thing if you struggled to get it going, you know?

But in this case I agree it's super rude to ask ""what kind of person enjoys this?"" while sitting with a loved one who you know enjoys it."

This is totally something I could have written before I got sober. I can really feel the emotion behind those words, like something special is being ripped away.

But, to be frank, I have never yet met anyone who sees drink as an intrinsic part of enjoyment who had a *truly* healthy relationship with it.

You have referred to drinking as a 'daily habit'. It seemed totally weird to me when I got sober but it turns out it is *not* a daily habit for most people.

I was also a working professional when I had a drinking problem - it's totally possible to build up a dependency while holding down a job and a relationship.

Suggestions, sure, but fact is that the same stuff doesn't suit everyone. I'm never going to make my friends uncomfortable for... What benefit? Stepford wife looking photos?

The costume/play example doesn't really work because the actors aren't doing the director a favour by being there. Your wedding party is doing you a massive favour. Don't treat them poorly."

Each dog identified as a banned breed is considered individually, by an expert (hmm), and often left with its owners (if they agree to muzzle it in public and other detrimental restrictions).

It's a shitty legislation that needs serious modification, but there's no point trying to paint an inaccurate picture.

Edit: not a court, an 'expert'"

Â Â Â So late into the night,

Though the heart be still as loving,

Â Â Â And the moon be still as bright.


For the sword outwears its sheath,

Â Â Â And the soul wears out the breast,

And the heart must pause to breathe,

Â Â Â And love itself have rest.


Though the night was made for loving,

Â Â Â And the day returns too soon,

Yet we'll go no more a roving

Â Â Â By the light of the moon.

This is totally something I could have written before I got sober. I can really feel the emotion behind those words, like something special is being ripped away.

But, to be frank, I have never yet met anyone who sees drink as an intrinsic part of enjoyment who had a *truly* healthy relationship with it.

You have referred to drinking as a 'daily habit'. It seemed totally weird to me when I got sober but it turns out it is *not* a daily habit for most people.

I was also a working professional when I had a drinking problem - it's totally possible to build up a dependency while holding down a job and a relationship.

Moreover, he won't blame *you* for either leaving him or taking him away from your Dad. He knows these things have happened but that is not really connected to his best friend who happens to be involved, if that makes sense?

That said, if he isn't a big ball of wag right away, don't panic. New situations can be scary. If he is nervous it will be because of the sudden journey/ new house, not because of you. Just give him space and be gentle and reassuring.
