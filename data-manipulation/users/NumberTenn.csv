depression,fesm9c9,t3_eqcju4,1579366723.0,"I've been struggling with depression and suicidal for close to 6 years (since I was 10), I broke down and told my parents 2 months ago. All they did was threaten to put me in a mental institution and carried on with life. Life sucks."
depression,fefo5hq,t1_feeso4y,1579060636.0,"That's a lie about no one not caring about you, your example between picking you or a loved one isn't really a valid point. I love my mother as my mother but she is the reason why myself has become depressed. But honestly I'd pick her to die instead of you, I've felt your pain, pm me if you ever need to talk to someone. I'll try and reply asap, (timezone: est)"
AskReddit,fcyyky1,t3_ejdlbw,1578089943.0,"Growing up I had always been poor, like not knowing next time I will eat poor. When i was around 11 my Grandfather was dying of cancer and the will was suppose to be given to my father, acres upon acres of land in the country side, over $75,000 in guns, a expensive home in one of the nicest neighborhoods and over $100,000 in money.
Then my Grandmother (who is a sociopath) demanded my Grandfather to sign the will to her otherwise he'd die alone, this was the night before his death. Obviously scared of dying alone he signed it over. Ever since that night my life has gotten shitter and getting worse thanks to her.
I no longer speak to anyone on my grandmother's side of the family nor plan to."
