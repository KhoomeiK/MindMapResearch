Foodforthought,ffqd703,t1_fei8e0b,1580130981.0,"nice, good to hear. my brother is under the NDIS, and I'm insanely grateful for what it does for him, the life he's able to live. I'm really critical of our politicians lately, as I keep hearing/reading about how they abuse our tax system, but I'm insanely proud of our country when it comes to the NDIS."

Foodforthought,feh6h3i,t3_ep3o7y,1579110147.0,"I'm australian. I've heard of a few cases where our healthcare can really assist people with their problems, but I don't feel like one of them. I'm not sure how different my situation is compared to the average person though, as I've had a few injuries. 

I have never been able to afford private health cover, and our public health system doesn't cover much of what I have needed. I've had a lot of costs in the past 6/7 years with physio therapy including surgery for a knee accident I had when I was 11, and a lot of other forms of physical therapy (osteo, muskuloskeletal, chiro etc). I've had several large dental costs. I've also had a lot of costs related to mental health/therapy. I've spent thousands on health costs, maybe up to around 12/13k Aud in total. Lucky for me, my parents helped me with around a third of that amount. I think the public health system helped with maybe 5-10% of that.

I'm not intending to complain. Like I said, my parents helped a bit, and I've seen where the system works well, it seems to be mainly for older people who really need a lot in the way of expensive scans etc, but apparently even that is changing and becoming less supportive. But for what I've needed, the public health system really hasn't supported me, and private health can be too expensive as you have to pay for a while to get the benefits. I'm a 26 year old male. Not complaining, but the system is kinda shitty when you really need it. And I hear very often about our politicians and our mega wealthy blowing huge amounts on trivial things, as well as dodging taxes on a huge scale, so that's a brutal thing to think consider. I'm just lucky I've had parents who can help a bit. I feel bad for those who don't have that support."

It would be nice if all people in positions of power were well-intended, but I think it's far more likely that they are power hungry and selfish. I'm grateful to the people that designed these systems in the past for making it so difficult for corruption to pool."
answers,fedb56i,t1_fed1o3k,1579006318.0,"to OP... as a fellow Oz guy trying to see the bigger picture, the first paragraph of this \^\^ comment is spot on. Aus politics seem to be very corrupt, as both of our major parties seem to be owned by the vested interests. Then when you factor in the monopoly that Rupert Murdoc has on our media, both print and press, well.... things don't look great, it almost looks like Scomo is puppet being played.

Also the point that Scomo is overly religious as mentioned ausgekugelt above, therefore, it's all part of a divine plan. Australia is a great country, but our politicians are seeming very backward lately."
