selfharm,ff893wd,t3_eruteq,1579669621.0,"I've been told outright that it ""isn't a real addiction."" It's sad that selfharm isn't treated with the proper care. Either people don't acknowledge it as valid, or they get angry at you for it. The ignorance around selfharm baffles me, but I can also understand that it may be difficult to understand if you've never been there yourself. Still, people could stand to be a little more considerate to those of us who suffer."

>Put yourself in their shoes and imagine how you'd feel if they didn't wanna talk to you on certain days.

I wouldn't mind this at all. I know what it's like so I'm more than accepting of that. In fact it would feel nice to know that someone else I'm friends with feels the same way!

>Honestly, any friend that's okay with that and understands that part of you is worth keeping. They are the ones that like you for you!

I think this is spot on actually. The people who want me to be a part of their life because they like who I am and not because I'll talk all the time. They're the real friends"
