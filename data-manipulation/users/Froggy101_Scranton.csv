Is there a college in your area? There are likely tons of students who would babysit on short notice! Just take time to interview and vet them first."
Parenting,fgll0up,t1_fgl21p9,1580902775.0,"They’re more than double in my area... completely unobtainable for my husband and I financially, and we both work full time with great jobs."
AmItheAsshole,fglkso1,t1_fgku75g,1580902507.0,"I’m not sure if you’ll ever see this, but if the pain from her periods is so bad that she needs to leave school **that is not normal**. A whole host of doctors told me my entire life that period pain is normal, and mine was semi-managed by birth control. When I was 27 and stopped taking it to try and conceive, I went through YEARS of intense period pain. When I finally saw a fertility specialist, I described my pain and he went off about the shitty doctors who just told me it was normal and didn’t prescribe me something - he wrote a script right then and it changed my relationship with my period. 

I also want to give some unsolicited advice regarding your daughter being embarrassed to carry pads. It’s a real shame that a natural process that almost 50% of high schoolers go through is so stigmatized. Could you perhaps work on building up normalcy regarding periods and help work with your daughter to become comfortable carrying pads? She could get a small pencil case/makeup bag and place them in there to help make it not so obvious, but it’s really a shame that young girls are being forced to sit in their bloody underwear all because other kids might laugh at sanitary products."
Frugal,fgh6lia,t3_eydeyq,1580777912.0,I used all of our towels and stuff like that too! It filled boxes and prevented me from needing more boxes for towels etc
breastfeeding,fgh6gh3,t1_fgh5a8r,1580777816.0,"Are inverted nipples something that happen with breastfeeding? Or is it something you already have beforehand? Aka, if I’m not inverted now, does that mean I won’t have that later or may it still happen?"
breastfeeding,fgh4on8,t3_ey8l5u,1580776620.0,"As a pregnant first timer hoping to exclusively breastfeed, would anyone be willing to explain what the shields are for/when they would be used?"
AskAcademia,fgfkqfj,t1_fgfj1zr,1580741374.0,I’ve **never ever ever ever** had a job interview where I wasn’t asked about kids (I’m female). Makes me FURIOUS but I can’t act furious because then I’m a crazy lady. My husband has *never* been asked.
pregnant,fge2y8v,t1_fgdbi94,1580690157.0,I have the opposite experience - ANY amount of carbonation makes me sick for hours. Careful when you test this out
NewParents,fge26qi,t1_fge0qjl,1580689803.0,Or at least leave the door open while you shower do husband could attend to the crying baby??
ufl,fge1bql,t3_exvh64,1580689361.0,"I was a chemistry lab TA (years and years ago) and it likely automatically gave you a 0 when your TA input everyone else’s grades. It’s easily fixable, don’t stress."

Instagramreality,fgbyzy9,t1_fgbwpu5,1580667424.0,I simultaneously feel shame for being too fat and not having a big enough belly... depends on the person/people I’m with and the day. Other people’s comments and “advice” is THE WORST part of pregnancy.
