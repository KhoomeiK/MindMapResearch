Or you could just buy the new competition out, and either absorb it or operate the brand under your [corporate umbrella](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OVEEYB4HsCIHQLcUuDf3Hw.png), giving the illusion of free choice in the market."

todayilearned,ff9cln0,t1_ff95hmw,1579709960.0,"It seems like you are talking about the popular but ultimately flawed and false ""winners write history"" trope!
While the expression is sometimes true in one sense (we'll get to that in a bit), it is rarely if ever an absolute truth, and particularly not in the way that the concept has found itself commonly expressed in popular history discourse. When discussing history, and why some events have found their way into the history books when others have not, simply dismissing those events as the imposed narrative of 'victors' actually harms our ability to understand history.
You could say that is in fact a somewhat ""lazy"" way to introduce the concept of bias which this is ultimately about. Because whoever writes history is the one introducing their biases to history.
A somewhat better, but absolutely not perfect, approach that works better than 'winners writing history' is to say 'writers write history'.
This is more useful than it initially seems. Until fairly recently the literate were a minority, and those with enough literary training to actually write historical narratives formed an even smaller and more distinct class within that.

To give a few examples, Genghis Khan must surely go down as one of the great victors in all history, but he is generally viewed quite unfavorably in practically all sources, because his conquests tended to harm the literary classes.
Similarly the Norsemen historically have been portrayed as uncivilized barbarians as the people that wrote about them were the ""losers"" whose monasteries got burned down.
Of course, writers are a diverse set, and so this is far from a magical solution to solving the problems of bias. The painful truth is, each source simply needs to be evaluated on its own merits.
This evaluation is something that is done by historians and part of what makes history and why insights about historical events can shift over time.
This is possibly best exemplified by those examples where victors did unambiguously write the historical sources.

The Spanish absolutely wrote the history of the conquest of Central America from 1532, and the reports and diaries of various conquistadores and priests are still important primary documents for researchers of the period.
But 'victors write the history' presupposes that we still use those histories as they intended, which is simply not the case. It both overlooks the fundamental nature of modern historical methodology, and ignores the fact that, while victors have often proven to be predominant voices, they have rarely proven to be the only voices.
Archaeology, numismatics, works in translation, and other records all allow us at least some insight into the 'losers' viewpoint, as does careful analysis of the 'winner's' records. 

So while it's true that the balance between the voices can be disparate that doesn't mean that the winners are the only voice or even the most interesting.
Which is why stating that history is 'written by the victors' and leaving it at that is harmful to the understanding of history and the process of studying history."

We had a snowstorm last winter that shutdown almost my whole town mid day. Except dominos. Where I happened to be working as a driver at the time.
We stayed open well after dark. One driver quit. We closed after the door got half blown off its hinges.  (our store is oriented really bad for wind and the door opens perfectally to catch it. That night it finally gave in. Tho you can see where it’s been remounted a couple times and not really fixed). It’s a real pain bc customers will walk in and just leave it wide open blowing snow in and just stand there asking for their pizza. Like I can feel that breeze from 20 feeet away, your like 2 feet from the door. I know you can too.

Pizza places constantly run multiple deals. Really the only time you have to pay full price at a place like dominos/pizza hut is if your ordering a single pizza for delivery. Even then (at least at dominos) there’s multiple deals in the system that are *unadvertised* I.e. you have to ask for them specifically they don’t tell you them when you ask for specials. These can typically be found in the spam mail you get that most people throw away or online."
ChoosingBeggars,ff2l0jn,t1_ff2guqb,1579511061.0,"The amount of people who think the delivery guy is somehow on their side in sticking it to the man is crazy. The amount of times I showed up to people who just didn’t have enough money, yet expected me to let is slide was amazing. So you want me to pay for yo or pizza? Any money I’m short at the end of the night comes out of my tips.

Idgaf if your .50$ short. I’ll turn around and take that pizza back. Your gonna make me drive out, and not only not tip but expect me to pay for part of your meal? Sorry. 
Especially if it’s something I’d like to eat when I get back.

Edit: almost every pizza shop does it this way: you take the delivery. If it’s cash, you hang onto it til the end of the night. At the end of the night, management takes the total amount of cash deliveries, subtracts out your mileage pay and card tips. The amount left is what you owe them. You give them that, the rest is yours to keep. 

It would be insanely inefficient to have every driver after every delivery go to a register and cash the order. When you got 3 registers, 6 drivers, and carry out going on it’s just not feasible. So yes, if I get shorted and dont catch it it comes out of my pocket."

ChoosingBeggars,ff2kfav,t1_ff2iaqx,1579510217.0,"I get it but I also get it from the business point of view. You start a policy of giving out the pizzas after work to what I assume are homeles/just desperate people and it could lead to issues.

Because those desperate hungry people could tell other desperate and hungry people that this places gives out pizzas when they close. Eventually you could wind up with more people waiting out back than left over pizza to feed them. And you gotta go out there, alone, late at night and tell them this is all you have. What? I thought you guys gave pizzas to the needy? No we just give the old ones instead of throwing them away. Well I was told I would get food?! So there’s not enough food for me/family/ whatevee their situation. Why can’t you just make more? Now your the target and not the business. *You* are denying them food. Food they’ve been waiting outside for. Food they expected. 

Hell, now Imagine your a female and you know there’s a gaggle of hungry desperate people out back waiting for a meal. I imagine people who are desperate enough to to wait around at whatever time lil Fraser’s closes to eat dirty old cold 5$ pizzas out of a dumpster might  be desperate enough to get violent. Even if it’s just one person that desperate. 

Am I saying this is a definite series of events? No. Most needy/homeless/whatever people are fine people. But you never know, maybe one night someone who has mental issues shows up? Maybe one day someone snaps. 

Having a policy (official or non) of just giving out the food at the end of the night *could* become a safety issues for your employees.  And if you own the business, also massive liability issue if you’ve told your employees it’s ok to feed these people. Simpler for all involved to just have a policy to toss them. They know they can go get them with no repercussions, and your eliminating the safety/liability issues."
