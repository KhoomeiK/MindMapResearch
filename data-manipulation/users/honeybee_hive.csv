teachinginkorea,fe029zw,t1_fdzzpeo,1578801280.0,"I'm doing EPIK. Glad to know it went so smoothly for you! No interview or anything?


I feel silly for asking all of this lol"
teachinginkorea,fds4o35,t1_fdrxhdt,1578694272.0,"You're right lol. I read the instructions wrong, it's not usually needed for the 8802. Only in special circumstances. My bad."

korea,fds4kwx,t1_fdmj1s0,1578694215.0,Great. Thank you!
korea,fds4kab,t1_fdmkk8p,1578694203.0,I forgot about those. Thank you!
confession,fdggmj8,t1_fdgc6hj,1578395909.0,"Mm, one could argue that shame is worse than guilt. Constantly telling yourself ""I am wrong for existing"" is more harmful imo than telling yourself ""It was wrong for me to do this""

Shame seems more deep rooted and hard to argue with than guilt. Plus, there are at least healthy levels of guilt. Ya gotta have a conscience and morals somehow. Shame? I don't know what purpose it serves."
confession,fdehdio,t1_fdeeu0c,1578339056.0,Being able to differentiate between guilt and shame is so important trying to move forward. Good for you. :)
depression,fde9077,t3_ekwfsi,1578333818.0,Books like this frustrate me because I already challenge my thoughts daily. I can separate myself from depression. But it doesn't seem to make a difference.
depression_memes,fcxujv3,t3_ej9f82,1578070665.0,"Whoa. What the fuck dude. Did you actually find it funny, or was it more of a ""God I wish that was me"" kinda thing"
depression,fcqq0d3,t1_fcph6n3,1577890338.0,"It's so important to remember.

When I'm in a double depression it seems like I have to remind myself every 5 minutes. It's exhausting lmao."
depression_memes,fcqhcky,t3_ei9vg4,1577886007.0,Very interesting. Thank you for sharing.
2meirl4meirl,fcm4p4j,t3_ehlan4,1577764169.0,Too bad depression sucks any positive feelings/joy out of all of these. Anhedonia is a bitch
depression,fcl7eqn,t3_ehmqfh,1577741424.0,Relatable. Lost 13 pounds in 2 weeks because of this.
depression,fcipsja,t1_fciiav6,1577666940.0,"I get it. Really. December brain has been me for my whole life, and it hurts *so bad*. I'm not trying to say that the lies are *not* convincing. It's a damn fight that I've been struggling with too. Deep down I still feel like everybody absolutely hates me and would be better off without me, among...other things. I'm sorry if I came across as defiant or high and mighty."
depression,fciglew,t3_ehbnuf,1577662220.0,"First I want to say I'm proud of you and you are so brave. I'm glad you were able to recognize their stares as curiousity and not hatred or disgust - that's a wonderful thing.


Second, try to remember the feeling of the breeze on your arms. Capture it. I hope this can help motivate you further. Take care."
depression,fci7rlp,t3_eh6aac,1577658753.0,It's definitely a disease. It clouds your perceptions and causes your brain to do some serious mental gymnastics to try and convince you that what it tells you is *fact*. But depression is a **liar**.
depression_memes,fchdhbg,t1_fcha5on,1577649510.0,Thanks mate. Take care
depression_memes,fch5wfa,t1_fcgryek,1577647583.0,"I wish I could. Have to settle for talking to a professional for now. It'll be okay, I've been through it before on my own. Just sucks rn"
depression_memes,fcfnzf6,t1_fcdh1uj,1577632096.0,Bad bot
depression_memes,fcdx9up,t1_fcdtzyf,1577614730.0,Not fat at all. I weigh less than I did when I was 12 now. Thanks depression!
sugarfree,fbh59gp,t3_edc1pd,1576865611.0,"My mom makes sugar cookies every year. I used to love them. This year, I had one and...it wasn't as good as I remember. I still eat them like once a week lol, but this is a huge win to me."
