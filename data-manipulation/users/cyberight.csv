askscience,ffubf0z,t1_ffte73g,1580238440.0,I had a mild case of chickenpox as a child and had a mild case of shingles five yrs ago. I seldom get sick but was going thru a lot emotionally in '13-'15.

Washington,ff3oq91,t3_ergrb3,1579545591.0,People are mostly neutral abt handguns. It's the assault rifles and their association with mass killings that doesn't sit well with people. I liken the gun issue with cars to a degree. Cars are fine on the roads but sometimes people die in them for a variety of causes - mostly human caused. Then there's the assault rifle of cars: the tank. Why on earth does one need a tank on the highway? It can cause a lot of damage to everyone in its way (except the driver). It's a tool of war and has no place in society.

You can find a service job while you're going to school but unless you're a professional (medical, legal degree) finding a livable wage has been a challenge. The teaching market is saturated but all the universities (EWU, Gonzaga, Whitworth, WSU etc) are glad to take your $$ and give you a certificate. I've learned this is a WHO- you-know sort of place. Nepotism is rampant and many job postings are for jobs already filled. It's true. The jobs you see are often spoken for but they'll let you tailor a cover letter and resume and turn it in but it's all for naught"
