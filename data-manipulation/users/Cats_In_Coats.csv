pansexual,ffcha07,t1_ffc9tpl,1579799436.0,"I kind of use both. I think Pan fits me more, but Bisexual is something I don’t have a problem calling myself. People can think what they want about me, but I won’t apologize for who I choose to like.

I think it honestly depends on who I’m interacting with. Especially if I’m single, people’s perspective and assumptions shouldn’t bother me because I could ‘fit’ in it. With not being strictly straight or gay, there’s a lot of freedom but so much restriction.

Buuut if someone tries to invalidate Bi or Pan, I might throw hands."
ptsd,ffbchvv,t3_eslp2b,1579759613.0,I developed the habit of rubbing my neck to deal with my trauma as a kid and I still do it to this day. Kind of an object. It actually helps my family know when I’m feeling super stressed or having a flashback. Don’t even realize I’m doing it

ConvenientCop,ff3g7yt,t3_er5dwi,1579540402.0,This reminds me of the time I accidentally got someone else pulled over. An intersection was being worked on at night and I didn’t realize that there was a sign saying I couldn’t go straight since there was a shit ton of dust in the air from the work. I go and the person behind me followed. Then flashing lights. I made a U-Turn and realized like two minutes later what had happened. I’ve never been pulled over before and I felt so bad for the person who did.
