Be selective about tattoo placement. It will effect employment opportunity. 

A good artist tends( this not a guarantee, just common) to be available by appointment only and charges by the hour. 

You do not necessarily have to get inked at a shop on certain conditions- the artist has an autoclave which they must empty and assemble thier equipment In front of you.
