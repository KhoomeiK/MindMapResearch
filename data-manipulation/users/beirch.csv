edmproduction,fflvj0o,t3_e946yc,1580044665.0,"Hey I'm a little late to the party but I noticed you were asking about synths, saying you've never heard anything similar by other artists. I can tell you Odesza primarily use U-he Diva on pretty much everything. It's their synth of choice for that sweet analog sound, with lots and lots of processing of course.

The secret, I think, to that airy/dreamy sound is being very methodical in what sounds you place where, and how you EQ them.

They often use 808s, and a nice analog sub bass in the middle (standard practice of course), synths to either side, and what is important here is doing pretty hard EQing on the main chord synths. Pretty much low cut to 3-500hz, then high cut to 3-4khz, and make a pretty big dib (3db ish) in the middle of that.

This is to make space for everything else; vocals, percussion and what I like to call ""snacks"", which is all of the details: Arps, high passed samples, vocals etc.

You'll notice those details are often *heavily* high passed. They most likely sound shit on their own, but in the mix they fit, cause you have the 808s and sub bass below, synths in the middle, vocals a little above that, then you can place whatever else on top of that. Hi hats, cymbals, arps, snippets of whatever. Not at the same time or else they'll clash (highs get ""muddy"" just as easily as lows).

If you get the lows, mids, and vocals right, you can add air with everything else. Often their samples will have that kind of ""radio sound"" feel to them, which lends to their unique dreamy kind of indiepop/indietronica sound I think."

I find it's mostly drums you should be careful with, cause you're trying to make them sound like they're in the same room/space.

Background vocals, or stretched samples, ethereal stuff can often handle having a long, very thick mixed verb cause you wouldn't think they're occupying the same space anyway.
