survivinginfidelity,ffpq0a0,t3_eugjdu,1580101708.0,"You said you saw them parked, but were they having sex?   You should confront your wife and ask her what's going on with this friend.  Something's missing here."
Divorce,ffpphio,t3_euemdb,1580101232.0,"Alcoholic brain is one that is mean, vindictive, selfish, and angry.  It hijacked her.  She could or could not be cheating.  Either way, it doesn't matter at this point because she's toxic.  She will drag you thru hell if you allow her to.  If she's ready to go, let her go.  It will hurt a lot, but you will come out thankful because she would be out of your life.  Do it for you and your child."
askwomenadvice,ffpfz8v,t3_euaqme,1580094101.0,"She's liking the attention and mindgames with you.  If she's doing this with you while in a relationship, she will do this to you if you end up with her.  Would you like it if your girlfriend did this?

It's not going to end well if you pursue her.  Leave it alone and find a suitable partner."
askwomenadvice,ffh5h19,t3_etcii2,1579923647.0,"When you compare with women based on one man dating her in the past, you are doing her and yourself a disservice.   She was more than just her appearance, and so are you.  You just have to trust that  your partner loves you.  That's all you can control.  You can only accept yourself and be happy with the unique person that you are.  Your partner obviously found you attractive, which starts the relationship.  But the sustaining of the relationship is more than just looks."

AskWomenOver30,ff88ubo,t3_es4vcp,1579669381.0,"I can seriously say to you.  Unless he's very open to change and respects you, it will get worse.  On top of that, he will resent you because he will tell you to stop nagging.  This makes a very unhappy situation.  Now imagine this, but triple when you have kids.  When a man acts like a child, makes a mess and does not clean, you turn into a mom role.  It is inevitable the dynamics will happen.  Then the romance and sex go away because mother/child dynamics cannot be sexy.  Have a serious talk with him about how you feel and ask him specifically for what you need.  If he is open and follows through, then you have hope."

AskWomenOver30,ff7sktz,t3_es1n6i,1579657341.0,"I let it happen with a vengeance.  I start listening to sad songs,watch sad movies, think about my son and how much I love him.  I think about tragedy and how I would give up my life for my kids.  I just start balling."

Feminism,ff3l8ql,t3_ere9g4,1579543434.0,"I have a girl and a boy.  I try to teach them both to clean up after themselves.  My son is actually a lot better at keeping clean.  The idea is that we teach them everything and they have that choice.  I also think that perhaps we shouldn't minimize the household duties as if they are unworthy.  The goal is to value women's choices, not to pick and choose what's worthy vs unworthy for them.  If a woman chose to support her family by raising children and keeping home, that is every bit as worthy as other choices.  The important part is that she has that choice."
trees,ff3czz7,t3_erdtxs,1579538677.0,Don't judge. It's normal hormones.  It's expressing itself and will rebel if you try to exert influence.

japan,ff141rq,t1_fex77ss,1579475019.0,"It's not just a matter of changing laws.  Women are not having children because the burden of housework, expectations, handling in-laws, raising children, AND wanting a career are just not humanly possible.  Also, with obligations at work and afterwork activities, who has time to have kids?  It's going to take a cultural shift for them to see the possibility.  Women need support at home."
