Chennai,fff3acj,t1_fff2b73,1579874545.0,"Most streets have the name and number of the contractor painter on a compound wall at the end of the street or near the bin. 

You should call them up and tell them of this issue. Often times the company in charge is unaware. Try to resolve it with them first and threaten to complaint to CoC if they fail to follow up and rectify the issue.

We did that with our contractor in our ward, now their entire contract is up for review. (They are sort of placed on warning and performance is monitored by CoC, failure to improve on metrics means they lose the contract and face financial losses. Enough motivate them to work properly)."

Is the creature that you captured unique and only one known to exist? If that's the case, congrats, you are proud owner of a Monopoly. Forget licensing and manufacturing chests, let others come up with inventive uses. Just hire laborers and farm away and perfect the technique. Id say, start off with high prices and let the first adopters shell out as much as they can, then slash prices so that the masses can afford it. Also considering its D&D, invest in security and protect your prized asset aka the monster.

If there are plenty of such monsters, then the above option won't work. I would suggest licensing model depending on Macro economic factors such as Government structure, Patent enforceability, Kingdom strength etc. Since you mentioned it's new age, I doubt you can enforce IP and licensing is unlikely to work. However if the Macro environmental factors are suitable, the proposed method would be as follows.

Rule 1: Never give up equity (share of profit/loss) if you can chose not to.

The engineer should not be getting any share of profit just because they helped design the first fridge. They should be paid for designing the fridge in GP/SP and done with. 

Rule 2: Seperate your businesses into Strategic business units.

You have 1 commodity and 1 product, seperate them into 2 seperate businesses for better management. Fridge requires monster meat for it to function but monster meat can be harvested and sold seperately for other applications as well. Don't ignore that aspect. Have sole control of the latter and sell it at market price to the fridge company.

With regard to the fridge company, the only advantage you seem to have is first mover advantage in addition to having access to the monster meat which is an essential component. So, get a good design, a range of products for variety of needs and preferences, and come to the market strong. Having patents will protect you for a while but the inevitable copycat will emerge soon. Your goal is to do it better than they possibly can. 

Depending on how well you can enforce your patents you can price your product to be premium or just a healthy margin one.

Given the need for heavy investment for large scale manufacturing, I'd say give away 40% of the company and make them put up the money (the whole of it) for setting up the factory. If this is not possible, try to give away as little as you can get away with and try to retain at least 51%. 

If you have any of your own money, put it towards company 1 for making the resource extraction process better."
