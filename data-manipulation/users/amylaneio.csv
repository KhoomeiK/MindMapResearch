study,fg0ynhu,t3_ewbjhc,1580417607.0,"Nice! Personally, I use a modified version of something called the Kanban method, which you can do with Trello, Notion (the app I use), and many other apps.

Here's what mine looks like:

At the beginning of the semester, I created a column for each week, then went through the syllabus and added all of the assignments, tests, papers, etc to the appropriate column. Every day, I move what's coming up to the Tomorrow and Today columns. When it's done (but not turned in) it goes to the Completed column, and finally gets deleted when I don't need to be thinking about it anymore. 

The advantage of this is that I can get notifications of when things are due so I don't miss them. Plus I can also associate them with notes I take using the same app (though I haven't really gotten around to doing that just yet). Also, everything's actually sorted by the order I'm going to work on it, so I basically just need to pick the next thing off the list whenever I sit down to do homework."

They deposit the cash right into your bank account (or into an account the school partners with). Just be aware that it usually takes a couple of weeks after the semester starts (at least) to get the refund."
college,fdc4tia,t3_ekkdhe,1578267122.0,"Just remember to take bad reviews with a grain of salt, since students who do poorly are more likely to leave them than students who do alright.  I ended up with a couple of professors last semester that had bad ratings and turned out to be perfectly fine."

college,fczlsj5,t3_ejmavn,1578104020.0,"Your first two years are going to be mostly common classes that you'll need no matter what major you end up with. If you've got a couple very different programs in mind, it'd help to take a look at both and focus on classes you'll need for either one right now, so you can make a decision later."
college,fczjlyv,t3_ejjmmx,1578102667.0,I definitely feel this. I'm stuck at home with nothing to do right now. The semester starts in ten days and I just can't wait to stop the boredom.
college,fcxyclo,t3_ejhohg,1578072157.0,How was your attendance? Lots of professors will take that into account when it comes to the participation grade.
interestingasfuck,fcwl0y7,t1_fcwjhar,1578028564.0,I think you just described all of Reddit.
