UnethicalLifeProTips,fe56rj6,t3_enskcy,1578866114.0,"Let me change this for you: when shit hits the fan you have the first night to take over your local doomsday preppers location. Which should be fairly easy. Why, more than likely they will still be in a reactionary mindset and “activating” their plan. First everyone still needs to get home. Then they have to stay awake all night. The chances of that happening are not likely because they did not expect to be on guard shifts; thus, they will be sleeping for the first night and not guarding 360 degrees. Whoever is up will be on such high alert that they will react to whatever strange noise (diversion) the first night, allowing you to enter from the opposite direction, sneak up on them, and whisper “Epstein didn’t kill himself.”

On that same forum a gentleman said to never leave pellets in the auger because,for him, they absorbed moisture,  expanded, dried, and became like a rock. He said he had to take apart his entire auger to fix it. Additionally, it was recommended, for n another forum, to empty the hopper as much as possible; my pitboss has a chamber to empty the unused pellets; then use the pellets left in the auger chamber to do a high heat burn in the grill to clear the auger chamber and help clean the grill. I have always followed these instructions and have never had a problem. I hope this helps."
pelletgrills,fcpso8j,t3_ei9y9a,1577871280.0,Always empty your hopper and run your auger till it’s free of pellets. I use the last bit of pellets left in the auger to bring the temperature up and burn the grates clean.
