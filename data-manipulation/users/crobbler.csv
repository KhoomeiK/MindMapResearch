CatSlaps,fetrz4j,t1_fer0crr,1579379281.0,"Editing, camera movement, was it intentional or random that the second Kitty was there behind the corner and did the camera man know? Either way it's great, and then the pause before anything happens and then the fallout. Not too much, not too little, perfectly done."
CatSlaps,fenvp1z,t1_fenty74,1579291636.0,"Way to see things in a binary fashion. Yes, I love seeing things suffer obviously because of my half-assed Reddit comment. You know me so well, do you want to get married and have some evil babies with me and make even more evil videos of dogs who are afraid to pass the cat in the hall while their owners laugh like the assholes they are?"
CatSlaps,fenva3l,t1_fenu5mq,1579291407.0,"Didn't say it's cute, I would help the cat if I could duuuhhh. Film is an interest of mine and I happened to study it as well. It is well edited and the camera guy knew what he was doing. Sure, take it off this subreddit or whatever, but that doesn't mean I have to also state the obvious about how this is mildly cruel and not be able to voice my opinion about it in another way."
CatSlaps,fent4bd,t1_fenpidv,1579290391.0,"Well I laugh about worse stuff that's happened to myself, sooo... Maybe domesticating wild cats over centuries is the unnatural and inhumane thing? Or not, but come on. Like the people in here haven't done worse things in general than filming an uncomfortable cat? At least it's not homeless. I live in a city with tons of them but where I'm from we don't have any. Fuck America for letting this happen I say. Why would you want to live in this horrible country that lets these things happen to poor animals? People here also leave their pets in cages while they're at work for 10 hours on a daily basis. That's what I call a fucking culture of animal cruelty that has been normalized. Come at me with something real next time, thanks.

AskReddit,fejqaui,t3_epduqa,1579183124.0,"If nobody has already said it: solving a Rubik's cube. Like anything, there are impressive ways to do it and simple ways. Learning the simple way is like remembering your favorite cheat codes in video games (left, right, up, up, down right). You just perform these algorithms (yes, sounds like you're super smart too but again, it's just combinations of twisting a little cube) in order to eventually solve it. You don't have to remember the algorithms either. Just Google it, do it over and over again, and now you can solve it without reading instructions after just a few hours of practice. The hard part is remembering how to do it after time has passed. Like who remembers the cheat codes of PS1 games?"
