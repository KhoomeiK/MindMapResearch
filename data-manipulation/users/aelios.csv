A phone can take pictures and on recent phones, generally pretty good ones, but it's not going to have the range or options of a dedicated device.

If you want to compare hardware alone, best bet is look at dxomark. They test cameras and phones, just keep in mind the scores are not directly comparable; ie dxo camera score isn't going to compare directly to dxo sensor.

Let me repeat that.  The company that exists to test sensors doesn't directly compare phones to cameras. That should tell you something.

Phones are going to be more limited, with smaller sensors, smaller sensor spacing, virtually no lens options or raw support, and software making a huge difference in output (gcam vs manufacturer app).
