MISSING PERSON FOUND DECEASED - HOMICIDE INVESTIGATION

On Friday, January 3, 2020 at approximately 11:44 p.m., the Arlington Police Department was notified by a city utility crew that workers had located a possible body in a wooded area in the 7100 block of Webb Ferrell. Workers had been in the area attempting to fix a water leak when they discovered the body. On Saturday, January 4, 2020 at approximately 12 noon, the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office identified the body as Evan Lacey through fingerprint analysis. Investigators have met with the Lacey family to update them on the tragic turn in this case.

The Arlington Police Department has taken the lead role in what is now being classified as a homicide investigation. Mr. Lacey's vehicle has been transported from the Fort Worth Police Department and placed into the custody of the Arlington Police Department. Detectives will have to await the cause and manner of death ruling from the Medical Examiner's Office. Investigators do believe that foul play is involved in the disappearance and death of Mr. Lacey based upon the suspicious circumstances and evidence found in his abandoned car in Fort Worth on December 21, 2019.

Anyone with information related to this case is asked to contact Homicide Detective Coleman at 817-459-5373. Tipsters can also remain anonymous by contacting Tarrant County Crime Stoppers at 817-469-TIPS."
