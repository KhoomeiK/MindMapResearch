politics,fes83i0,t1_ferte4o,1579362381.0,"Can you tell me what kinds of policies you support which make you identify as Republican?

I'm for limited government and balanced budgets, which have traditionally been Republican platforms.

I think pot should become legal and abortion should remain legal (limited government). I think corporate welfare and subsidies should be eliminated, the ceiling on social security taxes removed, and wars ended swiftly (balanced budget).

I believe Trump is irreparably hurting the Republican party, going against every conservative platform they've ever claimed to hold. This will do lasting damage as voters and donors lose interest in a party that can't decide what it supports."

Dogtraining,feddzvw,t1_fec8qo3,1579008875.0,"Love this! Don't forget to visit work with the puppy while you're out on vacay. Maybe go in early/late/weekend when it's quiet for the first visit, get him acquainted with the building, do a few laps inside and out, visit the work potty spot. On another visit you can introduce him to co-workers, ask that they *remain calm* and not shriek or overwhelm him, have them give ""sit"" or ""down"" commands and treat him. On subsequent visits pantomime what your work day would be like, do you sit at a desk? Where will he go if you're in a meeting? Go to the potty spot every visit. These practice runs will help you both once you actually return, assuming you want to be productive at work ever again haha.

I have a border collie that's 8 months now and we've just started agility. She's my fourth dog,  second from puppy age, and I cannot express how incredibly smart and willing to learn she is.

fuckHOA,fe08sxh,t1_fdzzhnm,1578806227.0,"Because this shit always gets worse. If she's keeping a parts truck in her yard and ignoring the lawn and garden she's very unlikely to fix broken windows, falling gutters, or peeling paint when those things need replacing. Plus junk vehicles attract vermin.

So imagine you're the neighbor, it's 5 years later, and your job just relocated so you need to sell. Next door there's been no maintenance to the house or yard, there's weeds growing up through the parts truck, and she's renting to a friend who parks their car on the lawn and doesn't clean up their dog's shit. You think you're going to be able to sell living next to that? 

Maybe I'm being too exaggerative as to how this might spiral, but basically that's why property values are relevant.

Longer answer is that once the first neighbor sells under those conditions, that new owner might start storing his junk under tarps in their yard too. Why not? That girl does it, and his junk pile is no worse than hers... 

Now there's two houses like this in the neighborhood. The remaining neighbors realize their property values are dropping so they want to move away before it gets worse, which will ultimately make it worse faster as more junky neighbors move in.

And anyway that's why people like the idea of HOAs."
