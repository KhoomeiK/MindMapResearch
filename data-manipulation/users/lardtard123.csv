Mordhau,ffsah8y,t1_ffs9w7y,1580177083.0,You’re a better man than me. Blue on mountain peak everytime. Don’t really care on other maps to much I guess.
RocketLeague,ffs24m4,t1_ffs0uph,1580171268.0,Yeah I’ve heard diamond might be the worse. The higher you go the more people over estimate their skill and blame their teammates more.

Drugs,ffrpjhp,t3_eurvze,1580162968.0,Yeah just lost my best friend at 18 last week from a kpin overdose. I’m the one who found him too. Pretty shitty experience but honestly that’s where your bf will end up if he keeps doing opiates.
educationalgifs,ffr4bwf,t1_ffr40qd,1580150171.0,“I understand there’s no reason to pick hazards over turn signal” so why do you? There’s literally no reason to do that unless you want to confuse people. Seriously it’s easier and more helpful to use your signal. Why are you so stubborn?

educationalgifs,ffr1n71,t1_ffr06zh,1580148490.0,I’m not gonna say why you’re wrong bc that’s to much typing but you even said yourself a turn signal is clearer so instead tell me what the reason for using hazards over turn signal is. It’s not like it’s even easier to use hazards so why don’t you
educationalgifs,ffqyk5d,t1_ffquefp,1580146535.0,The goal of driving is to be as predictable as possible. Everyone knows what it means when you use your turn signal when parking. The goal of using your signals is to let other people know what you’re doing not to do what makes sense to you. There’s literally no reason to use your hazards over your signal.
educationalgifs,ffqfvwp,t1_ffqfghr,1580133390.0,Just stop doing that and be a normal person and use your blinker. Driving is not your time to be unique

Whatcouldgowrong,ffd394y,t1_ffcdbj4,1579812556.0,But they are? They are still guns and should always be treated with respect but saying it’s “incredibly ignorant” that they are less dangerous is just wrong. You have a very high chance of surviving a 22 to the body vs any other round.

Drugs,ffcswqv,t3_espfrh,1579806595.0,If you don’t need it to get off a harder drug I wouldn’t recommend taking it then. I just started taking it again for fun and if you aren’t careful it’s easy to get addicted because it’s an opiate even if r/kratom won’t say it.
Drugs,ffcspx8,t3_espx1w,1579806484.0,If he has been taking them for a while and you haven’t noticed it probably isn’t that big of a deal and he is taking doses like he says
Drugs,ffcslcg,t3_esq2qi,1579806408.0,Yeah you could smoke but it would make it more intense so if it’s to strong wouldn’t recommend. You probably already know but make sure dxm is the only active ingredient or you’re gonna have a bad time. Also taking it is putrid so be prepared to throw up.

Drugs,ffcqzp0,t3_esx8fo,1579805444.0,Yes it’s even recommended if you can’t swallow it. Your best bet is probably apple sauce. It might take longer to kick though since you have to digest the food too.

Drugs,fdmap31,t1_fdm9smq,1578544085.0,Well definitely drink a decent amount more than average. It will help a ton.
Drugs,fdm6mtk,t1_fdm621e,1578541084.0,At least you aren’t addicted but I’d definitely recommend keeping it to a race occurrence. As for the behind the wheel I’d highly not recommend it. I went kinda high to mine once and it went fine the talking was the hard part. But if you’re super sleep deprived and on a meth comedown that sounds like an awful time to drive since and you don’t have much experience either. I’d just reschedule.
Drugs,fdm5zrl,t1_fdlgfe0,1578540629.0,Staying hydrated throughout the day will help the most. Also Ik it’s disgusting and I never do but if you can eat some healthy food that would also help. Magnesium supplements also help with the comedown and teeth grinding.
