SelfAwarewolves,ffn1sbz,t1_ffjna32,1580061073.0,"No you are mostly right. In 1700s England firefighters were paid for by homeowners insurance. This led to competition for which firefighting company would get to put out the fire. Also the firefighters asking if the homeowners are insured. If they weren't, the men wouldnt get paid, so they walk away.

Benjamin Franklin started the first american homeowners insurance company in 1752, but when the colonists came to america they realized that system was pretty wack so all the neighbors just sort of mutually agreed to help eachother if something bad happened. Some people were better equipped to fight fires and thus was the birth of the Volunteer Fire Department who worked pro bono and were regarded as heroically fulfilling their civic duty. 

This system is pretty much what we have now except somewhere along the line society started funding them via state taxes because they deserve to get paid for risking their lives for their fellow man- but not let the finances of someone who's life just went up in smoke determine if they deserve help.

You can also make molds and pour the foam in to let it expand, instead of sculpting from scratch. Perhaps in a silicone bowl- let that set up then pour some foam on a wax paper and stick your dome to that as it is rising. You will get better adherence if you rough up your set surface first.
