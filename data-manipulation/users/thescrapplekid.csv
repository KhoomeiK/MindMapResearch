AskReddit,fckjyw9,t1_fcjjabh,1577726983.0,"I remember seeing a friend roofied practically in front of my eyes. About a decade or more ago I worked at a dive bar as a bouncer. I can't remember if I was working that night but I was there.  We were a townie bar that opened every Christmas day at 8pm for the people who had moved away and everyone to escape their families. My friend who was a regular walked in and she had just gotten done with her ups shift. We talked for a moment and she went to the bar to get a drink. What felt like 10mins later she was acting like she was wasted. Something wasn't right. Someone described the man who was next to her (older guy, chuck Norris lookalike) but unfortunately he had split as soon as she started getting attention. It was a good thing her sister was there to take her home, though she fought us trying to get her into the sisters car.

It also happened to a Male friend of mine around the same era. I'd been to parties with this guy shaped like a linebacker who would down Jameson like it was nothing. We were at an  afterwork function at a bar (another bar and the function for my fulltime job) he had just arrived with his girlfriend who was another coworker. Gotten a drink but left it with her to use the bathroom. Someone had dosed him while she was holding it. She was pregnant, so not drinking. Luckily she took him to the hospital because something wasn't right. They did bloodwork and he'd been roofied. She also described the same ""older chuck Norris"" as that happened at my part time job. 
It can happen to anyone, be careful with your drinks around other people"
