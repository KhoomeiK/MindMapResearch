bodybuilding,ffiiuyr,t1_ffieyob,1579974921.0,"idk man, I'm told it's fine to use our school email as our professional email since ours won't disappear even after grad and many employers expect it. Everyone I know uses our school email in job applications, especially in OCR/OCI. This is for the finance industry though, and unfortunately name brand does matter in this profession to some extent. Though I'm not from Cornell, I'm from another Ivy."

I'm trying to break into IB though which is ultra competitive and the recruiting cycle is pretty much over, so I'm sure that plays a part into it"
