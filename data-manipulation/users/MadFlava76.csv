starwarsblackseries,ffew1eo,t1_ffedtsr,1579867918.0,"That is what I did a few days ago. Preorder 1 for myself and 1 for my nephew who is big into the series. With Cara being restocked, I was wondering if regular Mando was being restocked also."
starwarsblackseries,ffedp6k,t1_ffed87u,1579844217.0,"Wow, I didn’t know regular Mando was going to be restocked this early. I wonder why some stores didn’t have a preorder? Hoping I can snag one at regular price. Got heavy mando by preordering from BB"
starwarsblackseries,ffeb53m,t3_et4o1x,1579841841.0,Interesting. I've seen March as the preorder delivery date for black box Mando. So there will be an earlier one at the end of this month also?

starwarsblackseries,ffccmpj,t3_esjtbk,1579796567.0,"I think our only hope is for China KO manufacturers to build a decent quality knock off. After hearing some of the complaints about the poor paint applications and frayed cloth in the official release, I'm wondering if a KO could actually be better than the original in this case."
starwarsblackseries,ffc8l1z,t3_esarui,1579794014.0,"I look at it this way. If Hasbro isn't going to meet the demand on some of the older rarer figures, then I'm fine with China filling that void. Just look at the debacle that is the Purge Trooper. Hasbro only made enough so that GameStop could push their exclusive game bundle but people actually want the figure and might not want the game. This is where China KO's can come in and supply that demand. I hope in a few months we will see Purge Trooper KO's if Hasbro can't get it's shit together."

starwarsblackseries,ffayzsi,t1_ffadic7,1579747761.0,Exclusive are really hard to find where I live. They seem to never restock and I see the same pegwarmers that have been there of over a year. I also live in an area where scalpers are very prevalent. I've run into them on occasion clearing out of store of their Marvel Legends and Black Series exclusives. Finding Mando was hard even with PopFindr.
starwarsblackseries,ffaykin,t1_ffawklq,1579747478.0,"Yup, still in stock as of 8:30pm"
starwarsblackseries,ffayf2d,t3_esghc4,1579747379.0,"Thanks so much for posting this OP. I was just about see how much she was going for on Ebay and if it was ""reasonable"". Now that I found the Mandalorian this week and have had IG-11 and Off-world Jawa. Cara was the last figure I needed. Now only if I can find a Purge Trooper?"

starwarsblackseries,ff8oyb6,t3_es7nq1,1579689626.0,So are purge troopers only bundled with the game? Or will GameStop eventually sell it as an exclusive figure by itself. Seems like in order to do that there needs to be a restock
politics,ff8o6sa,t3_es3z7y,1579688477.0,"There is so much overwhelming evidence yet Moscow Mitch and the GOP in the Senate will stop it from being presented at trial. This country is truly broken. It is not “We the people”. It is “We the party”, the Republican Party."

todayilearned,ff5phch,t1_ff5fzm6,1579604739.0,I think Mario was more skilled and had greater physical attributes but I think Gretzky’s hockey sense was greater. He has more assists than anyone has points.
todayilearned,ff4ysy8,t1_ff4e300,1579575720.0,He didn’t need to be the fastest because he always seem to know where the puck would be a few seconds before anyone else.
todayilearned,ff4yogp,t1_ff4da7a,1579575633.0,"Gretzky’s hockey sense is second to none. Arguably, there have been more skilled players but nobody read the game and anticipated as well as Gretzky. Not Crosby, not Lemieux, not McDavid."

AskReddit,feeczs0,t3_eojio7,1579031215.0,"When my co-worker got promoted to manager, all he did was hire women but it wasn't because he was trying to promote women in the work place, no he did it to be creepy on them. Every male candidate failed to get a job working for him and he would hire less qualified women. When it came to promotion time, he would give the biggest pay raises to the women. Eventually his creepy antics would come back to haunt him. All the women he hired eventually quit or found new jobs because they could not stand working for him. Many of them filed complaints against him in their exit interviews. I moved departments to a new manager because I couldn't deal with his behavior. Soon after, he was suddenly stripped of his manager duties and reverted back to a regular software developer. I'm surprised he is still here after getting such a huge demotion."

starwarsblackseries,fdqouqg,t3_emq8o6,1578671674.0,"Worse thing about getting back into collecting is the damn scalpers. I'm the type that actually takes my figures out of the box and plays with them and decorates my desk with them. I don't care about resale, I hope one day my son will start playing with them and call them his own. The scalping and store exclusive bullshit is essentially killing my interests in collecting slowly. I hope Hasbro realizes that this is a negative effect of their strategy in generating buzz for their product. I predict, that 2020 will be my last year of collecting black series and I started when TFA first came out. Waiting for black series Zeb so I can complete my Rebels crew and peace out."
