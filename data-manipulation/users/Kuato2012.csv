Battletechgame,ffet9hn,t3_et901i,1579864471.0,Are you sure you got a whole 'mech? Sometimes the rewards are pieces of salvage.
Battletechgame,ffbnt54,t1_ffbnlwc,1579774719.0,"Nyuk nyuk.

It was three cyclopes (all headshotted) and a thunderbolt or something. And that was it."
MensRights,ffbghls,t3_escb5i,1579764240.0,"In the US, with our history of racial segregation, we have the unfortunate concept of the ""uppity negro"" (not my terminology). It refers to when a first-class citizen sees one of the second-class citizens rising above their supposed station in life... At which point it is (or more commonly *was*) suggested that they ought know their place and step down where they belong.

I only bring it up because I'm seeing a strong parallel here."
Battletechgame,ffal9c0,t1_ffak2gx,1579738568.0,"It doesn't, I just tried."
AskReddit,ff8in7y,t1_ff6664r,1579680220.0,Same thing happened with me and a free-range cockatiel. She crawled up behind and gave an inquisitive (and thankfully gentle!!) little peck with her beak. Right on the ol' hackysack.
todayilearned,ff8i6wf,t1_ff7z1hm,1579679616.0,Ever bump your thigh on the corner of a table? Imagine kidney punching yourself that way.
Battletechgame,ff88dxo,t1_ff5ugpk,1579668976.0,"Just for giggles, I recently ran a mission with three Archers kitted out like that. The fourth lancemate ran around in a Raven as the spotter. It was stupidly good."
Battletechgame,ff886cu,t1_ff81t6p,1579668792.0,"Yup, 4x Gauss (doing 90 + 5 damage each with the 20% boost) is totally possible. You have to armor it down to about 50%, but with Gauss rifles you're generally standing nowhere near the enemy anyway."
Battletechgame,ff5pwfb,t1_ff5p4yg,1579605325.0,"...mine do :D

I'm always trying to save the civilians and stuff in the flashpoints, too."
TIHI,ff5jtcc,t3_erlfx4,1579596252.0,Myostatin 2 mutation. Bully whippets have the same thing.
coolguides,ff5ip0w,t1_ff4jtz0,1579594681.0,It's embarrassing to go to the ER and get diagnosed with a panic attack BUT... It's worth it. Even just knowing that they ruled out heart issues helps reduce the anxiety a little on future attacks.
Battletechgame,ff5hzjn,t3_erax44,1579593737.0,"Headshot builds are a strong strategy, but I'll just add this: if you're concerned at all about the  immersion or roleplaying aspect, then know that headshotting someone is basically murdering them for better salvage. 

If you take out their CT, they have a chance to eject. Not the case when you hurl a PPC through their dashboard."
Battletechgame,ff2hxoi,t1_ff2hh6u,1579506900.0,Wasn't easy! It's a hot planet (desert or Badlands) and the 'mech was on continuous alpha strike duty with 5 UAC5s.
Battletechgame,ff2grzr,t1_ff2ci04,1579505465.0,Lol I don't even see those anymore. It may horrify you to learn that my whole inventory is like that.
Battletechgame,ff1oxhp,t1_ff1e5av,1579482931.0,"The flipside is that those 10% bonuses from optional objectives (which stack) add up when you prioritize the paycheck over salvage. Doing full paycheck on wimpy missions has netted me some giant paydays, worth much more than the available salvage.

But now that my Merc review board rating is high, I seem to run into good mechs more frequently. I'm thinking salvage is probably the way forward."
AskReddit,ff1n4vi,t1_ff1iw7i,1579481943.0,">The trolley problem doesn’t factor in to this

The problem conveniently becomes more manageable if we oversimplify it.

The many people that would be directly harmed in this scenario are the countless crotchspawn that she would undoubtedly turn out and be unable to care for (she had a well established pattern of doing just that). In doing so, she also creates indirect harm to taxpayers and the community. 

There is a gray area here, whether or not you choose to acknowledge it. If the surgeon had ""just followed orders"" and left her alone, he might have contributed to a greater net harm. That's the whole dilemma here."
AskReddit,ff0og3t,t1_fexvctm,1579470783.0,">There’s no grey area in this

 [The Trolley Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) disagrees. Most of us claim we'd be willing to commit a small(er) tragedy in order to prevent a larger one... right up until we're confronted with a concrete example of that choice.

People seem to be arguing multiple different points in the responses. One is whether he made an unethical choice in the abstract sense. The other argument is whether he has violated his ethical charge as a surgeon. The latter might be more black and white.

But to throw even more gas on the fire, we could ask ourselves whether ""just doing my job"" is an adequate excuse to allow evil to persist when you had the option to intercede.

This is social media though, where hot takes reign."
Battletechgame,ff05m5f,t1_fezulkv,1579465429.0,"I didn't think there would be anything worth salvaging on such a low mission, so I took the money.

The consensus sense to be that the salvage is generally more valuable though, so I guess I'll start doing that."
AskReddit,fexf2m6,t1_fexdxoy,1579429946.0,"The woman already had 13 kids, so it's not like he kept her from fulfilling her biological imperative. And they were all removed to protective custody, which strongly suggest that the mom was a  piece of shit.

I'm not saying the surgeon is a saint, but this case seems ethically gray at worst. The greater good may have been served here."
