pregnant,ffh5tzo,t1_fffkxi8,1579923929.0,I couldn’t feel mine until they were actual labor! I just had my baby on the 9th this month. Congratulations on being 33 weeks and best of luck especially since you’re right at the end!
beyondthebump,ffdcrif,t1_ffd5ur1,1579818133.0,"I think she stays awake for close to an hour right now including feeding. She eats for 30-45 minutes pretty consistently and then is up for maybe 15-30 minutes after. How did you play with him when he was this tiny? I cuddle her and read to her but she just falls asleep; it doesn’t really stimulate her. 

Her lullabear isn’t very loud, but we’re pretty quiet at night and she’s the only baby in the house. We leave the TV on, but it doesn’t seem to bother her as of right now. Most of the time she wakes up because she kicks out of her swaddle or flails her arm and it wakes her. I’ll definitely try the Houdini swaddle method you mentioned! Thank you."
beyondthebump,ffd9j96,t1_ffd7e0m,1579816081.0,"Will do. I’ll give them a call and see. She doesn’t have any health issues, but she’s my first so I’m a little overly cautious when it comes to her. 

And oh okay. I’ll try that tonight and see if it helps at all. Thank you!"
beyondthebump,ffd964n,t1_ffbnufn,1579815868.0,What sorts of activities can be done with a newborn to keep them awake? I’m interested in trying the eat play sleep method of doing things but a little confused on how to play with her while she’s this young. The most I get is a couple minutes of eye contact and sometimes she’ll grab onto my hands before she starts to fall asleep.
beyondthebump,ffd5br2,t1_ffbx4l6,1579813717.0,"She’s at 10.4 lbs as of yesterday. Does that mean I should stop waking her up to feed her or should I wait until our next pediatric appointment and get the okay from her doctor? 

How did you get the pacifier to stay in his mouth? My girl won’t keep sucking on a pacifier once she realizes that milk doesn’t come out and then she’ll spit it out. 

And thank you. I think that may be part of it too. She’s a bit nocturnal right now."
beyondthebump,ffd5009,t1_ffbv4hj,1579813535.0,Thank you! Will definitely look into buying it :)
