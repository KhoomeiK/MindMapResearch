Like I've already lived my full potential of happiness back as a teenager, since I did all the things I enjoyed without the pressure of a job, debts, partner, and all the other stuff that comes with being an adult. Smartphones are constant reminders of those things, and I guess it is consuming our simple happiness.
That's just my opinion."
