We dissuade people from killing themselves, but want to nickle and dime them when trying to actually get help so they can try and survive in this miserable world. It's so fucked up.

I had a consultation with a therapist yesterday, it was my first time trying to get professional help. My insurance didn't cover the deductible, and I can barely pay my rent, so it's not coming out of pocket. I had never felt so defeated sitting in that chair and seeing that my mental health doesn't matter as much as a fucking deductible. But if I say that I want to shoot myself, I'm the one that's wrong. It's bullshit. 

And I meant no offense or anger toward you, r/realitysoapsportsfan, I do hope your husband is able to get help, and I hope you are not neglecting your mental health either."
