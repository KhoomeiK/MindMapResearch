Firstly, phone camera's do the exact same thing, flat mirrors actually do reflect your appearance perfectly, it is simply a angle of perspective (as for why telescopes invert images it's because of the focal length of the concave mirror, hence why I specified a *flat* mirror). The real reason why phone camera's are worse than mirrors has to do with the optics of the lenses and the display. Mirrors filter out less light than lenses (having higher reflectivity than the absorption of light caused by the lense), they also do not distort your reflection as much as a phone camera. And then you have the problem of translation of the image to the display.

Coronaviruses are single-strand (as opposed to double strand like human DNA) RNA viruses with a peplomer shell that links to receptors on host cell. The shape is where the corona name comes from. 

The reason why coronaviruses are dangerous is because they often have a relatively high fatality rate for a easily spread respiratory illness; SARS and MERS had around 10% fatality rate as compared to the deadly Spanish flu which only had 3%. If they became pandemic there would be a much larger loss of life than the swine flu from 2009 which killed 150k+ and only had a .5% fatality rate.
