AskReddit,ffkkrfd,t1_ffkk8kf,1580024395.0,"Oh sheesh. I can imagine. I heard enough just being a cashier at Cracker Barrel. People constantly complaining, screaming about their shitty food and/or service, demanding a manager at that very instant. So frustrating. Makes you wanna go home, curl up in a ball, and hibernate forever. Then when the reality of you're making less than $10 an hr sets in, you really start to question things lol"
AskReddit,ffkjr4v,t1_ffkjird,1580023916.0,Oh mylanta. I hate even going there. Can't imagine working with those people. Ever notice how the rudest individuals possible are always the ones working at places like the Wal-Mart  customer service desk? Lol

I have noticed the incest based ones are just so...well done? It's quite odd, but even when I try to switch it up, I always end up right back where I started, lol"
AskReddit,ffkhgur,t1_ffkgid6,1580022827.0,"Oh boy. I did the retail section all throughout high school. I was actually only supposed to have a seasonal position, but my manager wanted to keep me, so I stuck around for 3 years. 

One of the most interesting experiences was me asking a woman if she wanted Halloween candy. She then deemed I came from the spawn of Satan and needed to go home to repent my sins, lmfao

Let's not forget about the one time I watched a table for one of the servers and accidently asked a blind man if his food looked okay. Instant face palm. 

Or the time I managed to knock down an entire display of our brand new Yankee candles as the district manager was about to enter the door.

The one that takes the cake is when one of my coworkers whipped out a bright yellow highlighter, popped off the cap, and started sucking on it like it was her new favorite snack when standing right next to me. Found out later that she has pica.

There's plenty of stories to go around. Never a dull moment with me, hahaha"

If I had to pick one, it's probably going to be incest. I enjoy incest related porn/erotica and have never been interested in partaking in it with my own siblings, but that probably has a lot to do with the usual mental barriers of ""fuck this, it's just too weird"" 

John is more of a pounce and bounce kinda guy. That has never rlly been my thing, but just once is probably worth a shot. He goes to the gym, takes care of himself physically, and I can see it morphing into a damn good time. 

Tbh he was ""adjusting"" himself next to me when watching movies on New Years and it was kinda hot.

2meirl4meirl,ffihiae,t1_ffi2yfz,1579974001.0,"I just want to say your resilience is so admirable. Look at you kicking ass and enjoying life!! I also went through a very traumatic relationship. I fucking hate calling it that and used to feel guilty for seeking out therapy, in fear of taking someone's spot who needed it more than myself, but it's true. My rescue bunnies were given away to a ""farm"", along with my cats. I was spending my nights screaming into nothingness, hoping with every ounce of my soul they were dead and not suffering somewhere. At least that stops the need to worry. My paid off car was totalled. My self confidence was next to nothing. Despite all of my accomplishments up until this point, I felt like nothing but a disappointment. I was the first person ever at my high school to graduate with honors in 3 years and couldn't even enjoy myself.  I was a hysterical disaster marinating in denial. I became a lachrymation station. 

Had grown up around the entire family of the person I was with since I was 5 years old. My dad and I hardly ever speak, so my partner's dad was my outlet. I loved that man so much and still do, yet I can no longer speak with him. 12 years of a budding best friendship, 6 years of dating, and I was chewed up, spit up, tossed around, and left to die. 

My world came crashing down. My heart was shattered. I spent my entire summer going to therapy multiple times a week, crying my eyes out every session. I would sit in parking lots at 2am, blasting music, fighting the urge to bang my head forcefully into the steering wheel vigorously just to end it all. Experienced my very first panic attacks and spiralled into the depths of despair and self-hatred. At this time, I was only dealing with the aftershock of the situation. I had not even began to address all of my emotional issues that built up throughout the duration of my relationship. 

I started experiencing flaashbacks of arugments that would send me into panic. Remembering being told my entire life is school related and means nothing, my family is garbage, and that I was and always will be a toxic bitch. I had pushed all of the horrific feelings associated with things of that nature so far down that I was numb and forgot they even happened. My brain blocked out everything. It was years and years of intricate and methodical manipulation tactics. And it worked. 

The key word being ""worked"", as in, past tense. Guess what. I worked my ass off all year. Took me 6 months, but I bought another car. Took 23 credit hrs last semester. 27 this semester. And I graduate in May with a Bachelor's of Science an entire year ahead of time. I'll have a 4 year degree that I earned in 3 years at the age of 20, and have enough credits to probably get a Master's over the summer if I really wanted to. I'm applying to medical school this cycle, started going to the gym, and finally stopped dreading the thought of waking up. And am planning on rescuing another bunny as a graduation gift to myself.

My greatest gift is, despite all of the revolting, despicable, truly merciless acts that I endured, I never became someone I didn't want to be. I'm the same outwardly loving selfless college girl who will do anything in her power to help others.i realized all red flags just look like flags when you're wearing rose colored glasses. I now know my worth and vowed to never let someone treat me like that again. I'm just a little fragile these days.

There were a lot of things taken from me during that time, but my strive for success and resilience factor were never touched. I didn't know that at the time, but I do now. It sounds like the same is true for you. 

I hope someone in your near future showers you with love, affection, and cherishes every moment spent with you. You deserve nothing less. I just wanted to be sure you knew that. I decided to share a part of my story in hopes that it would help you understand that you're not alone and it is okay to struggle during the time of healing. You're not expecting too much by asking to be treated nicely. You're a beautiful soul. And I can't wait for you to make 2020 your bitch."
