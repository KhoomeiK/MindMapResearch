We keep the house in good condition and clearly the house doesnt seem or smell doggy else the landlord could have picked that up when he visited but he didn't. 

I will be be paying for a professional clean of the house whenever we leave."
dogs,fdqmrk7,t1_fdqhikp,1578670354.0,"Well i'm referring to the 2/9 scale not 2/5.

I also know a very fit lean retriever and yes, they do look a little odd when you consider what the breed norm is, however I can still tell the difference between a fit lean dog and this dog.

I have stated before, this dogs ribs, spine, pevic and hip bones are clearly visible and prominant on its body. It's not overly furry, i would say it has a short to medium coat and is all black.

Thanks about the worming thing, I think I may approach it that way. I just dont want to accuse them of not feeding him or anything cause im sure they do, I just don't know how it seems to be getting thinner and not just maintaining its slender frame."
dogs,fdqb1ko,t1_fdq92c4,1578661679.0,"Yeah because I don't want to sound accusatory, I just want to know the dog is okay for my onw peace of mind really... I don't want to be poking too much into peoples business but, i am concerned the dog is ill or not being fed enough :("
dogs,fdq7c7b,t1_fdq6t7r,1578657956.0,"No it's not covered in fur, and no i'm not confident in my ability to determine the extent of malnourishment, simply because I'm not a vet - but the fact that the dogs ribs, spine, hips and pelvis are clearly visible from a distance, not just touch or closeup examination is alarming to me, despite not being a professional. This dog is 100% underweight - I just couldn't comment to what extent."
dogs,fdq53zc,t3_emnqy7,1578655248.0,"My dog is called Alfie, but we always call him Alfie-san (like the Japanese honorific haha)

We also call him the boi, dat boi, floofer, sploofer, nugget, nug boi.

And then whatever he is doing + boi

e.g Snoozy boi, swimmy boi, yawny boi, silly boi, barky boi, zoomy boi"
