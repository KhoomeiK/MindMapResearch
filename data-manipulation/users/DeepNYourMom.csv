weed,ffiqgu9,t3_etv526,1579980166.0,"#Marijuana is definitely addictive

Sometimes if I go a week without my marijuana vape or some flower, I wake up in the middle of the night I'll be all dizzy and confused and it's hard to breathe while I'm very disoriented and this is definitely because of my body's response of not having any.


What I usually do when it gets like this, is  I open up a door and take a couple of breaths outside until I get reoriented. but I definitely wanted to let you know that I'm right there with you buddy I experienced the exact same feelings you're not the only one you're not alone my dude! 

what I do when I feel alone and scared and it's dark and I'm dizzy and I can't breathe. Is definitely try to get some water in me and try to sit up and watch a familiar TV show that brings comfort what I do is I turn on family Guy and I lay down and just the familiar voices I've heard since I was about 10 years old help calm me down,
