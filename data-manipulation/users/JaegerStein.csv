vexillology,ffji4nu,t1_ffjh338,1579998720.0,"So we're getting there. Limiting government power and expanding democratic participation. The Swiss use a mixed system of representative and direct democracy, in which people have the possibility to vote on laws and decision themselves alongside parliament, instead of hoping the guy they elected two years ago does exactly what they want. If Puerto Rica was to adopt a similar system, would you still want the elected government to decide whether to pursue statehood or independence, or would you want to have a vote yourself?"

I was aware of that, that's why I said in context with the fist.
So you have no preference either way in the matter, whether statehood or independence, as long as *something* happens? Dissolve the government, elect a new one that hopefully isn't corrupt, and then let them deal with the issue?"
vexillology,ffjeb83,t1_ffjcmwu,1579996455.0,"The white star as a standalone symbol without the fist could mean anything, but in combination  with the fist as context, it's almost impossible to not see it as leftist. 

Also, the political view you describe lacks any form of substantial motivation and understanding. It's the believe of angry people, who just want things to be like they were before. Its only goal is to return to a perceived former status quo, without the desire to understand the reasons behind ""corruption and government ineptitude"" and without any thought about what would need to change to prevent this from happening again."
