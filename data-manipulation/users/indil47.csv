Catswithjobs,fcrqsmk,t1_fcrp5vk,1577905368.0,"If you Airbnb, you can look for any kind of unit. It can be a room in a host’s house or a separate apartment or an entire house... you’ll find it all. 

But you’re a guest. Hosts can’t ask much of you in the line of chores (some do, despite charging a cleaning fee... that’s a long story.). But to ask them to take care of a pet is a big no-no. That’s like getting a hotel room with a dog in it. 

Now, in the instance of renting a room in a house or any kind of property that the host is actually on site... well, there is sometimes a bonus that they have a pet onsite. The most that is asked if you is a couple of scritches on the head. And the posting has to clearly state that the host has pets, so a guest doesn’t come in unaware. 

I, for one, tend to avoid places that have dogs. But if there is a kitty that might crawl on my lap during my stay?  BONUS.  

Usually, though, I tend to stay in independent units with the host not present on site. And if I were to encounter an unaccompanied pet there, I’d be alerting Airbnb support super fucking fast ‘cause that’s 100% wrong. 

That being said, there is TrustedHousesitters.com which is a paid membership site... in which housing *is* exchanged for pet care. I just used it over the holidays myself and had great luck - I was able to vet my sitter, chatted with her over FaceTime, and I got to go visit family over the holidays worry-free, without breaking the bank over a paid sitter, and she got to enjoy my touristy town and my snuggly kitty over Christmas with free housing.
