Let's lie to our own people about why their friends and family are dead.

Leave everyone in limbo over what happened for days while trying to come up with some bullshit to explain how it wasn't their own fault. 

Finally admit to accidentally shooting down a commercial aircraft due to nothing more than their own military's incompetence. Because every commercial aircraft transmits a civilian signal on multiple bands and their transponder clearly identifies them as a passenger aircraft. Not to mention that a competent radar tech can tell the difference between a cruise missile and a fucking 737. Mainly because a cruise missile doesn't transmit civilian airliner signals. 

Journalists quit because they are finally tired of telling lies to their own countrymen. 

Arrest civilians that dared to document a tragedy and release the video, not knowing any details about the crash. 

Try to shift blame by saying that the fuck up would never have occurred if tensions with another nation weren't so high... 

..except when has Iran not had tension with another nation? If it wasn't the U.S., they would have blamed the ""tension"" on Israel. 

The religious fanatical government of Iran is fucking clown shoes... they are a joke.
