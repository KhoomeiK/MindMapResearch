I assume they made it as a weird way of giving teams who are losing by a lot a chance to make a big comeback. The problem is that both teams have that opportunity, so it sort of negates the point of it. 

What would really happen is that bad teams (or losing teams) would be encouraged to chuck up worse shots at the end of the game in desperation if they're losing by a wide margin. Teams that can shoot daggers would just bury those teams since the incentive is on them to hit 8-pointers to extend their lead rather than seeing it shrink quickly. I think it would actually increase deficits rather than see more competitive games. Every once in a while you might see a team losing by 16 sink a couple and suddenly have a competitive game, but more than likely you'll see the winning team just use their existing padding to pile it on at the 3 minute mark."

But yes, you are unapologetically bias for your own religion. I can at least respect Muhammed’s aim with his religion, he wanted to take over the area and spread out across the known world through warfare and made it evident. But you have concocted a bastardized modern version who would simultaneously like to do the same but tell everyone it’s a religion of peace. So you’re neither  fully Muslim, nor liberal, just a monstrosity of apologetica."
unpopularopinion,ff83zsz,t1_ff838zw,1579665382.0,"> You can't make a cogent argument for the idea that Islam is inherently more violent than Christianity or Judaism and you don't seem inclined to try.

I could. Islam conquered via right-of-sword theology and established theocratic rule and law from India to southern France. Christianity didn't even spread that far, and it relied on non-militaristic expansion everywhere but Europe. Judaism never bothered with militaristic expansion because their territory is strictly defined in their holy book.

We probably agree on most thing, but I am not under the impression that Islam is less or equally violent than its Abrahamic predecessors in practice, because historic reality is evidence."
unpopularopinion,ff81uyn,t1_ff7zzvj,1579663796.0,"Well, it actually is, although I am not making a case for Judaism or Christianity here. But neither of those religions conquered strictly by the sword—something Islamic did rapidly and with great success."
unpopularopinion,ff81qrn,t1_ff80k7o,1579663711.0,"Anybody can read the verses themself, it’s not like Muhammad tried to hide the motives. Modern Muslims like yourself are a far cry far from Muhammad, and far more apologetic. 

Khaybar, Khaybar, Ya Yahud! Jaish Muhammad Sa Ya'ud! ...am I right?"
unpopularopinion,ff7z0p2,t1_ff7uy7g,1579661751.0,"They apply to both cities. And the expulsion of Jews and Saudi Arabia resulted in many deaths. The battle I posted is merely the most famous rally cry for modern Muslims. Jews are still banned from living in Saudi Arabia to this day, they can only live there if working as a foreign national. Israelis are not allowed to KSA.

Anyways I don’t know what this has to do with anything other than illustrate that Islam is a very biased religion, far more than any other religion. It is exotified and romanticized by many in the west so people ignore that it’s history is far bloodier than other religions."
unpopularopinion,ff7ygm8,t1_ff7us1k,1579661359.0,"Are you making a point that Islam is just the same as the Jewish Torah, or that it’s completely different? You should figure that out before propagating. And if you’re  suggesting that they’re equally as bad, try not to use a Jewish quote directly from the Bible to illustrate your point."
unpopularopinion,ff7t066,t1_ff7rqtm,1579657634.0,Jews weren't allowed to purchase Jewish slaves. Where do you think Islam copied their notes from?
