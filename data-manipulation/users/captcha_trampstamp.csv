aww,ffby5ek,t1_ffbmhpr,1579786502.0,"There are service dog groups who breed their own lines of labs and golden retrievers for service dogs. A friend of mine has worked for one for over 15 years. They’re the breeds that have the intelligence and temperament to be good service dogs most often. 

Moreover, it costs a ton of time and money to raise a service dog, and many dogs still don’t make the cut. By raising their own dogs, the groups can ensure that the puppies are raised and trained correctly from day 1, and they up the percentage of dogs that actually make it to become service dogs. They get massive amounts of socialization, special training, and spend lots of time in different homes with different families as they’re raised. 

The dogs who fail out are still highly sought after- a lot of them go on to be therapy dogs, drug or bomb sniffing dogs, and tons of other jobs :)"

happycowgifs,ff39l3h,t1_ff38m9w,1579536899.0,"Actually most modern cattle get fed with a lot of seconds from food manufacturers, especially dairy cattle because so much of their caloric intake goes to making milk. Bread, pumpkins and other gourds, sugar beet pulp, candy, vegetable seconds- farmers buy these by the ton to supplement their stock. 

Beef cattle are usually finished out on things like corn, malt, and other grains before slaughter since it increases weight gain quickly in the last few weeks."

You’re experiencing something millions of people go through every year- living and using our bodies often results in damage. 

The good part is that treatments have advanced a lot over the years. Often, simple tears can be fixed through very minor, outpatient surgery. 

Do yourself a favor and see an orthopedist as soon as you can. They’re the ones that work on joints and all the associated crap that goes along with them."

That’s not because pit bulls are somehow meaner or worse than any other dog, by the way- they are just intensely, devastatingly powerful by design. I’m a very strong, experienced animal handler- I regularly work with 1-ton draft horses, oxen, and large animals in general. I’ve been damn near yanked off my feet by more pit bull terriers than something that was bred to pull 10,000 lb wagons."

It’s like someone distilled pure, youthful innocence with the smell of asphalt and summer, and set it to music. It twists back through wishing you could go back to being young again, feeling freedom for the first time. I feel like if I ever wanted to pick a song to play at my funeral, it’d be that."

Take divorce. I’ve been divorced for 7 years now, and I try to reach out to Redditors I see who are just at the beginning of that process. I remember how ungodly painful it was, and how fucking crazy it makes you, even if you WANT the divorce. It really is one of those life situations where you either get busy living, or it eats you from the inside out with misery, anger, and bitterness.

If you haven’t been in the dark place, don’t fucking tell people “Well, I’m sure you’ll find your way out!” People in need of hope need to know that other people experienced what they have."
