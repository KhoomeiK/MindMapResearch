todayilearned,ffmwk4s,t1_ffmar2t,1580059694.0,"My whole company is open concept and always has been. The CEO and founder have the same desks as everyone else. Not even cubicles. And the culture there is really great. Sure, sometimes it can be a little distracting, but mostly it's highly collaborative in a positive way, and there's no toxicity about it. People are bad when they think things are being taken away from them. Office to cubicle would of course be upsetting, but that's only because they had been led to believe they deserved an office in the first place. If the culture is instead, ""everyone is equally available"" from the CEO to the interns, that's a much more positive dynamic."
comedyamputation,fff8pr0,t1_ffewu1z,1579878499.0,Well voldemort did more than almost kill a kid. Not caring about accuracies is what makes the joke

AskReddit,femz8op,t1_femut9c,1579273369.0,"The cannon for that is literally that voldemorts soul inside him is affecting him towards that. Rowling definitely brushed off the abuse he goes thru, it's emotional effects are constantly downplayed in the story."

explainlikeimfive,feisovq,t1_fehl45h,1579146208.0,"Wow, great to know. To be honest, this is my existence, almost 24/7. It's a vicious cycle - hard to start eating more when I never feel hungry and eating can make me nauseous. People sometimes have a hard time understanding I don't feel hunger like they do, but this is it. The pangs are there but the appetite is not."
movies,feh02s4,t1_feguexk,1579106319.0,"Maybe. Tarantino has been consistently on the record for years saying he's stopping at 10 movies, that's one more. I think if Sony were smart gamblers, they'd much rather have those bucket loads of Chinese money on this release rather than one more possible future release that nothing is known about."

TeslaLounge,fcunk63,t1_fcuhh3s,1577984803.0,"Informative comment, but ""it generally means that the Porsche has a lot less Energy/ AmpHours available to use"" while taking up ""the same amount of space"" is *exactly* why people call it inefficient. Maybe the drive train isn't what's causing the inefficiency, it's the battery specifically, but it boils down to *this is an inefficient car.*"
freefolk,fcb7s6c,t3_egy82u,1577583471.0,literally just watched this scene. woah
