Look at how tankies deny the Holodomr like it was just some natural phenomena, that the Stalin and the Politburo didn't do nothing even after they imprisoned or executed every competent farmer for ideological reasons, then took the remaining farmers and introduced collectivised farming again for ideological reasons and even after the travesty caused by this they exacerbated the famines by basing agricultural policy on research by a hack scientist Tofrim Lysenko. Which was the same research used to dictate agricultural policy in communist China. This is the effect of socialist ideology before you even start to get into the enforcement of it.
