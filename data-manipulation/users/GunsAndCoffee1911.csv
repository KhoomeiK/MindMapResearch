Parenting,fckak5t,t3_ehh8py,1577720929.0,"First of all, I am so sorry you are having to go through this. I can't imagine the pain you are feeling and also the ultimate betrayal of your brother.

However, I can provide some insight on the legal side of it. Sexual assault suspects are rarely arrested that quickly. There investigations take time. I'm not sure if she had a sexual assault kit done at a hospital but if so it has to go to a crime lab first. Evidence may have to be collected. Since your brother is a suspect they have to compare DNA samples, and if he is uncooperative they will have to get a DNA search warrant just to get a sample from him. I'm guessing a patrol officer or deputy took the initial report, which then usually goes to a detective. Just know that this is most likely not the detective's only case. I know you are all hurting but there are also other victims hurting and depending on that detective, too. I promise he will get to you soon because this type of case takes precedent over any property crime. I don't know where you live but in most states because the victim is a juvenile they will arrange for a forensic interview with a children's advocacy center. Once they get your daughter's statement they will attempt to interview your brother and any other witnesses or people who may have any information. Only then can they get an arrest warrant for him. Please let your daughter know that just because he hasn't been arrested yet doesn't mean he's not going to be charged. I wish you the best of luck and I hoped your brother is brought to justice."
Conservative,fck8w6g,t1_fck1u6z,1577719765.0,"And it's not just my ""word"" against the defendant's. It's the weight and credibility of our word. Articulation adds a lot to it. If all a defendant can claim is ""I wasn't drunk. The cop is lying,"" and I testify ""Yes he was intoxicated. He was driving 25mph in a 30mph zone at 0330 hours and crossed the center line twice. Upon stopping and making contact with him I observed his eyes to be bloodshot, glassed over, and droopy. His speech was slurred and I smelled the odor of an alcoholic beverage on his breath when he spoke. I asked for his driver's license and he handed me a credit card instead. I put him through standardized field sobriety tests. In the horizontal gaze nystagmus test I observed a lack of smooth pursuit, distinct and sustained nystagmus at maximum deviation, and over of nystagmus prior to 45-degrees, along with vertical nystagmus. In the walk and turn test he could not maintain balance while I was giving instructions and started before I told him to. He missed heel to toe on the 2nd, 5th, 6th and 8th steps, stepped off the line on the 2nd, 3rd, 7th and 9th steps, and made an improper turn. He took 12 steps down the line and 15 steps back instead of 9 like I instructed. On the one leg stand test he used his arms for balance and put his foot down several times. During the tests I had to repeat the instructions multiple times because he kept interrupting and claimed he could not remember what I said,"" which one would you believe? This is called building a case. It's not that I'm making it up to get a conviction. It's that I've done it so many times I know what to look for and how to articulate it in my police report and testimony. And again it's a slap in the face for me to put in all that work just to have a prosecutor decline to press charges. I wouldn't put in all that work if I didn't think the person was guilty of it."
Conservative,fck7jsd,t1_fck1u6z,1577718772.0,"I should be more specific... I guess I didn't mean JUST our sworn word. But our sworn testimony along with a well written report articulating detailed facts proving our case. I've had it multiple times before where the defendant admitted in court to doing what they were charged for and the judge still found them not guilty. Like for example I had a simple crash where the driver admitted on scene that he hit a patch of snow which caused him to jet into the next lane and hit the car next to him. I wrote him a ticket for Too Fast For Conditions. In court he admitted that hitting the patch of snow caused the crash. The judge found him not guilty because she felt that cops overuse that particular statute every time someone crashes when the roads are snowy or icy. Well no kidding, judge, because people drive to fast for the road conditions and crash, HENCE THE STATUTE. I honestly didn't care that he didn't have to pay a fine, but the principle of it that the judge found him not guilty when he basically admitted in court that he was guilty is a huge slap in the face to law enforcement.

A lot of it is on the prosecutors, too. I know at least a lot of ours have gotten extremely lazy and will do everything to avoid going to trial. So I may have a rock solid DUI case, but if my body camera malfunctions (or if the file gets coded wrong and automatically deletes after 90 days instead of 3 years, like what happened to a friend of mine) they take the standpoint of ""if it's not on video it didn't happen."" It's extremely frustrating because in instances like this we put in so much work (a DUI, for example, usually takes 1-3 hours from start to finish, plus a detailed report adds another hour or two) just to have a prosecutor decline to even press charges. And now that person who was clearly a danger to the public is off Scott free and is probably going to do it again because the time he got caught probably wasn't his first time doing it, either."
Conservative,fcj8gtg,t1_fciyz7n,1577679925.0,"I can tell you as an LEO who started before Ferguson, there is absolutely a Ferguson Effect. Darren Wilson was SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN innocent and it didn't fucking matter. His career is now ruined because of a false narrative. When the President of the United States sends White House officials to the suspect's funeral and publicly chastises Darren Wilson despite him being proven innocent, why would we even bother being proactive anymore? There have been several times in my career where I've been in situations that could have turned into deadly force and I've found myself thinking, ""What will the media say about me? How will they spin this to make me the bad guy?"" It absolutely affects us. And that hesitation could mean my children will never see their dad anymore. Fuck that. The media is killing cops in ways they don't even realize.

Ferguson changed everything, man. Citizens wanted cops to have body cameras, now we have them and the left is crying because it isn't showing what fits their narrative. And God forbid my body camera fails or something happens before I have a chance to turn it on because then the court and media think I'm a liar. It's to the point where a cop can barely even testify to a DUI anymore without body camera footage because judges don't take our sworn word as credible. 

People always want cops to have more training, better training, this that and the other. But guess what. Training takes time and money and those same people who cry for it don't want to fund it. I've now got so much extra mandatory shit I have to do that I can barely be the police. This year alone I had three extra hour+ long online classes I had to take, in addition to the one online training I already do per month. And guess when I have to do that... DURING MY SHIFT because it would cost money to pay me to come in and do it when I'm not working the street. But do you think I can just do it all at once and get it done? Nope because crime didn't stop so it ends up being I come in and work on it for a bit until I get sent to a call, rinse and repeat. So what does THAT end up being? It means we skip through all the slides and take the BS test at the end without actually learning anything because we have better shit to do like actually being the police and helping people.

Oh and don't get me started on the mandatory racial profiling paperwork I have to fill out every time I stop a pedestrian or search a car now (which the statistics have shown that we are NOT being racist, so obviously the study will continue until it does, because that's what my liberal state wants to see). Every time I stop someone or even ask to search a car I have to fill out an entire paper with the subject's information and race. Oh and don't forget to provide the subject with my business card including the date time and reason for the stop, which I give them before they tell me to go fuck myself. So instead of being proactive like a good cop and making citizen contacts, nobody wants to fill out all the stupid paperwork that comes with it. Nobody wants to voluntarily put themselves in a situation where they could be the next Darren Wilson. Nobody wants to be the next cop to go viral on YouTube. So I'll just keep sitting in a parking lot watching YouTube or something until the next call comes out.

TL;DR - Darren Wilson was scientifically proven innocent but it didn't matter, now his career and life are ruined. And no cop wants to end up like that so proactivity has taken a nosedive. Also noted I have 10x more extra shit I have to do that I don't have time to actually do cop shit if I wanted to."
