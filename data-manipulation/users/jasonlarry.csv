worldnews,ff4kqja,t1_ff3ty7w,1579565977.0,That's the thing. Why the hell do these scientists publish those science articles when the so you should has not even a reliable cure yet. like I had to have any more expectations played around with and I wasn't menscience myself I would never deliver results until I'm sure of it fuck anyone who who gets people's hopes up fuck them.

This is more or less the same, but with easier steps. 
Purchase the electronic version of the book. Probs gonna pay $200. That's fine. They won't let you downloadnit and will only let you view the book from chrome or something. 

Press cntrl+p (print page) and select print to pdf and save it together. I think there's a limit of like 100pages per print, so repeat however times needed and merge using and online pdf merger. 

You now have an offline pdf version of the book that you can share to other students. 

Ask for a refund as soon as youre done. These corporations need to understand paying a week's rent for a book isn't easy for students.

Forget about whatever conspiracy theories people are throwing around. 63 canadians reportedly died. (And more iranians) but it is as you said. Regardless if it russia, Iran or USA or fucking antartica for all I care,it is unacceptable to allow that many people die unless for unforseen issues. The only satisfying outcome I would get from this if I see actual evidence from the blackboxes that it was a technical failure of some sort. Anything less, I think Canada should act up and attempt to make justice. Holy fuck im mad.
