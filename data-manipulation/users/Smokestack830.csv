averagedickproblems,feg6epv,t1_feg5uqh,1579079129.0,"My original comment was in reply to the guy saying that ADP is for big guys who want to feel better about themselves. They said that, presumably, because they are from SDP and feel like anyone over here is considered big and should have nothing to complain about. I think that is incorrect, as plenty of us are of average measurements and could not be considered big.

He was trying to minimize ADP issues because we, we in general, are larger.

P.S. I mean no disrespect with this comment. If it offends anyone, I apologize"

That's all it feels like right now - just killing time as it passes slower than ever. And I agree, there is so much to life that we miss out on experiencing as smokers. I just wish I could go out and enjoy it. The boredom has me stuck in this chair watching YouTube vids all day lol.

Hopefully more in time  :)"
