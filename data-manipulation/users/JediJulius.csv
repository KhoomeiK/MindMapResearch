RedDeadOnline,fflygln,t1_fflthmm,1580045751.0,"Weight also updates if you die, fast travel or occasionally when you enter your moonshine shack. Plus you only gain calories if you hear a ‘ding’ sound when you eat. So space out your meats and stews by ~60 seconds a piece and your calories (dings) will be much more consistent for faster weight gain."
modernwarfare,ffly32y,t3_eu5n38,1580045546.0,"Deagle isn’t overpowered, the other pistols just need a slightly higher fire cap. It’s kind of funny that you can fire the FAL, a 7.62 rifle, much faster than a 9mm pistol with a lightweight trigger

Deagle kicks ass and is an awesome pistol."
reddeadfashion,ffjlvit,t1_ffjj0lv,1580001244.0,"The pants and shirt are a bit looser than RDR2, the RDR1 and Online Vest is unbuttoned at the bottom and flares out whereas the RDR2 vest doesn’t flare out at the bottom. Also some changes to coloration on certain pieces.

Plus in RDR2, John’s hair is a copy and paste of Arthur’s except jet black and doesn’t have an option for his classic or story mode hair (classic JM hair is in Online)."
reddeadfashion,ffjg5up,t3_etysrm,1579997554.0,"Unfortunately, Online players can get a nearly identical replica of John’s Outfit (Outlaw Pass) and even his signature hairstyle, but story mode John only gets a 90% correct replica and doesn’t get his classic hair.

It’s made even worse considering beta screenshots of John have a more accurate Cowboy Outfit (resembles the Online one) and something closer to his classic hair."
MWLoadouts,ffi7pwe,t1_ffhnat9,1579967269.0,"Corvus has smaller ADS and move speed penalties than the M16 Barrel, but less range. Using the longer barrels combined with the Commando Foregrip basically turns the M4 into a laser. Stippled Grip and No stock counteract the move speed and ADS penalties (though no stock gives the M4 a bit of its recoil back.)

Basically they’re aiming for an M4 with less recoil but better range while also trying to offset some of the negatives by improving the ADS and move speed. 

M4 has a solid move speed so I’d eat the 2% loss from the Commando Foregrip and run the CQB stock instead for better recoil than No Stock but that’s just my opinion if I had to run a ‘meta’ M4. Seeing as they tended to use the MP5 with collapsible stock, the pros like their move speed."
RedDeadOnline,fffndn1,t1_fffk8ot,1579887686.0,"I understand. I’m just kind of pissy about old limited stock items and don’t understand why don’t occasionally bring an item or two back for a week or so. I understand the exclusivity helps them sell (except maybe the animal print reskin shit lol) but I feel like they don’t need to be permanently gone to get those panic sales, just gone for long stretches of time. I actually have a ton of the old items, but I find it entertaining how lightning fast such catalogue glitches are fixed."
dbz,fffm1o1,t1_fff47as,1579886874.0,"If they use Shintani’s designs or something like that for the next season of Super we’ll probably see much more fluid animation than previous Super. The designs are much looser and more animation friendly than Yamamuro’s stiff, shiny Super designs with 3-4 layers of shading all the while sticking closer to the manga and more recent depictions of Toriyama’s art.

Due to the nature of budget and time constraints it might not have as many in-betweens as the movie, but considering the solid and talented staff rotation by Super’s end, if they can get better scheduling and pre-production then Super could probably look pretty damn good for a weekly action series."
RedDeadOnline,fffbyty,t1_fffa2wd,1579880604.0,"Hello, creator of the big URL coupon glitch post here. On my end and according to an increasing number of reports the ‘buy’ button is missing on old limited stock items. This renders the coupon glitch useless since you can’t actually buy the item (or circumvent the normally not functional buy button)."
RedDeadOnline,fffbmk6,t3_et8ika,1579880387.0,"It’s actually sad. The Coupon Glitch lasted unusually long at a few weeks, probably due to the holidays (thankfully).

RedDeadOnline,ffa635d,t1_ff9zrwe,1579728602.0,"They seem to have patched it and removed the buy (checkout) option.

JOKR (Javelin) needs to travel up into the air SIGNIFICANTLY faster, especially when targeting aerial kill streaks. A moderate anti-vehicle damage buff would be great too. The actual radius and damage against infantry is mostly fine, it’s just the cripplingly slow travel speed and arc that is the big problem.

I disagree with a damage buff to the Pila though. I wouldn’t mind a slight reload buff, but it’s already the everyman launcher that is easy to use against aerial streaks while still being pretty fast and useful against ground targets."

MWLoadouts,fedo441,t3_eoligk,1579016196.0,"One thing that amuses me with this gun is that you can fire this 7.62 rifle at a whopping 500 RPM, yet the .45 and 9mm pistols are only allowed to shoot at ~300 without a lightweight trigger (and the 9mm only goes up to 400 RPM with it). Pistol balancing aside, I generally and surprisingly liked my time with the FAL. 

However I would love to see the two shot kill area include the stomach. An interesting idea would be to make the stomach damage 50 and upper torso damage 55. This means that if you hit the upper torso a shot anywhere else will be a 2 shot kill. However, hitting the stomach would mean you need a stomach or higher shot for a 2 tap.

It would still require skill, but help the gun a little bit in direct firefights where chest shots aren’t always reliable due to the arms."

Fortunately, my additional points for DBZ would mostly be Goku’s upbringing (or lack thereof) as Sirfray above me mentioned as well as clear instances of Goku showing genuine concern for his friends as well as horror and rage at their deaths (especially Krillin). Although a warrior from another planet dropped on his head as a baby, Goku still shows that he values and cares about other people many times, sometimes significantly, even though he occasionally has a bit of trouble properly showing it.

When Gohan was kidnapped by Raditz, getting him back was Goku’s first priority and Goku told Gohan to run once he was free and Raditz was angry. When Krillin died the first time in DB, Goku openly cried and was angered even though Krillin could be revived with the Dragonballs. On Namek, the normally friendly Goku snapped and told Frieza that he (Goku) was going to make him suffer for killing Krillin. He also is angered when the Saiyans kill his friends in the Saiyan arc, etc.

The thing is, DBZ Goku is one who shows some character growth from DB and (*relative*) maturity. Although a kind, fun loving, and occasionally naive guy he still often thought of his friends and family as well as grasped the gravity of the situations they were in. He even was quickly angered a couple of times when innocent civilians were killed in front of him, despite them being total strangers. In many ways, he felt like someone who grew up from the child in Dragonball and learned from his past experiences while still retaining most of his benevolent and goofy nature. He cared for Gohan and was proud of him, even if Goku was often dead and thus not around all the time. In return, Gohan still often looked up to Goku, respecting him, what he did, and was often inspired by his Dad’s resolve and abilities.

I am also excluding the original English Dub Goku which misrepresents him as being some outright honorable, moral hero, but his positive traits still generally appear in Japanese.

Unfortunately, DBS Goku in some ways feels like a slight regression in that Goku is less mature and seems to ignore the consequences of all but the most dire situations. If I remember correctly, Toriyama didn’t like that Goku was viewed as being heroic in Z, so he made Goku more dubious in Super. This is also exaggerated by having more times of peace or lower stakes, so Goku doesn’t have as many serious situations. This was partially rectified in the Goku Black and Universe Tournament arc, but I still feel that Goku as a character in Z and Super are different enough that I would probably have to build a whole other case for him and his flaws/shortcomings (and wouldn’t have nearly as strong of a case either.)"

I mostly just focused on stuff that showed that many of Goku’s absences were due to often necessary deaths and training that likely would’ve lost other future encounters without."
todayilearned,fcrurd3,t1_fcrgfz7,1577906882.0,"Great, here come all the TFS fans beating the dead horse that Goku is a bad dad. He has flaws as a person, but it would be boring if he didn’t. Although he has trouble with emotions and responsibility plus Piccolo and Vegeta are more mature individuals, many of Goku’s shortcomings were due to either death or naivety, not always being a completely shit person.

1. Goku raised Gohan for the first couple of years. Goes well.
2. Goku sacrificed himself to beat Raditz, a necessary sacrifice that saved the planet including Gohan in the moment. Even while this was happening, Goku was begging Gohan to run for his life.
3. Goku is dead and absent for a year. Piccolo KIDNAPS and trains Gohan for this time, originally planning to use Gohan to take over the world, but having a change of heart.
4. Without the skills from King Kai in this year of absence, Goku would’ve lost to Nappa and Vegeta.
5. Goku is late to Namek due to recovery, training, and travel, still saves Gohan and ultimately allows everyone save himself to get back to Earth alive or be revived with Dragonballs.
6. Trains and spends much time with Gohan several times throughout the Android and Cell arcs.
7. Has Gohan fight Cell, perhaps cruel or dumb but Goku was not strong enough to fight a 100% full power Cell (and Cell wouldn’t fall for a spirit Bomb), so SSJ2 Gohan was necessary. This also makes sense because Gohan had shown TONS of initiative and determination to train and fight during the Android and Cell arc. His complete pacifism is a bit of a surprise given how hard he had worked up to that point
8. (People often ignore this), when Piccolo points out Cell torturing Gohan, Goku shouts for a senzu bean and prepares to charge in and fight Cell so Gohan wouldn’t have to.
9. Even after that, Gohan was still grateful for his dad and found him to be inspiring, even using his uniform in the Buu Arc out of respect."
