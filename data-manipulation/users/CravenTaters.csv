LonghornNation,ffdkvar,t1_ffd9515,1579823028.0,"""I don't think people are trivializing the salary within the context of college athletics.""

That's exactly how the $10 million amount is being trivialized. The argument ""they had $200+ in revenue and a $30 billion endowment, ergo $10 million is nothing - that's what coaches get paid..."" trivializes the value of $10 million.

No one is arguing whether or not it's a risk.

""Shaka's salary is a sunk cost as far as the budget is concerned (in a more ways than one) so it doesn't effect the excess towards academics.""

That's just not true - it absolutely affects the excess. His salary is a sunk cost for the respective years, but when they have to come up with an extra $10 million at the end of the 2020 season, that's a different issue. But again, it's college athletics and $10 million is a trivial amount, so who cares (although the administration thought ~$14 million last year was not a trivial amount for a buyout, and thus, they decided to give him an extra year).

""Even then, the academic budget is billions of dollars, including hundreds of millions for staff. So the marginal amount that athletics gives to academia would hardly be noticed if it dropped.""

Again, this is the definition of trivializing $10 million. ""Oh they have an $18.6 billion budget, who cares about $10 million..."" Really?!?

""The fact that UT athletics gives any money to academia is a Testament to the strength of the LHF given how rare it is for an athletic program to directly give back to the University.""

Absolutely, no one will argue against that.

""At the end of the day, the amount we were paying Shaka was never going to towards academia or have a tangible effect on academia.""

Because $10 million is a trivial amount in the grand scheme of things?"
LonghornNation,ffd5hi6,t1_ffd59e1,1579813805.0,"Are you staying in Baton Rouge?

I need to get on my plan to get from NoLa to Baton Rouge for the game."
LonghornNation,ffd4mjv,t1_ffd2j6h,1579813324.0,"Maybe ""animosity"" is a too strong of a word - I definitely have no hate towards Shaka - more of a ""man, what a waste."" And I think just because one does not watch basketball, it still has an impact on the university as a whole.

I'm not saying it personally impacts me in any way, it impacts the current students and facilities.

""getting paid the remaining guaranteed money to go away isn't causing an impact to students' tuition or fees."" But this just isn't true.

Yes, the ""University of Texas athletics department generated $219.4 million in revenue in 2018."" (https://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/texas-sports-nation/college/article/How-Texas-athletics-spent-206-6-million-in-2018-13588340.php, source citing public records)

""Texas’ athletics department also spent $206.6 million in 2018.""

So can we agree that a $10 million dollar buyout for the 2018 budget would effectively ""wipe out"" profit (revenue - cost) for the 2018 year?

""The athletics department continued its tradition of transferring some excess revenue to the academic branch of the university."" 

If the academic branch decided to use $10 million (or whatever the ""some is"") in excess to improve a student dormitory, then I would absolutely say Shaka performing his job adequately ""could"" have led to making Jester dorms better - who knows how the academic department would have spent said money.

It's kind of blowing my mind how many of y'all are trivializing $10 million dollars to ask a guy not to show up to work."
LonghornNation,ffd19z2,t1_ffd0gjj,1579811439.0,"Oh for sure - not personally bothered - I just thought it was an interesting way to frame a poor coaching hiring and the consequences thereof.

It just made me think: “Not only did we have a decade of sucking under X and Y coach, but we also lost out on potential A and B campus improvements just to get rid of X and Y coach.”

Would they have actually  spent that money on improvements, who knows. But an interesting “what if” regardless.

With UT’s $25+ billion endowment and characters like McCombs throwing money around, it always seemed so trivial."
LonghornNation,ffd04ht,t1_ffcrswy,1579810801.0,"I’m pretty sure I can feel both, thank you.

Guy wants a competitive salary, great. He doesn’t negotiate his own contract.

He underperforms during his tenure - not great.

He is considered “so bad” by fans and the administration, that they would rather pay $10 million to get rid of him rather than let him finish his contract - not great.

Guy “sucks” at his job and gets paid to leave.

As someone who does not follow basketball and is an alum, you can’t help but think “man, that could’ve gone to something important to benefit students that would last years.”

You can respect someone for wanting what’s best for themselves, and at the same time have some kind of animosity if they end up underperforming to such a level, that you would rather pay to see them leave rather than let them finish their contract. One is self preservation (maybe self-worth is a better term), the other is performance."
LonghornNation,ffczeen,t1_ffcc43y,1579810398.0,"Oh absolutely, UT will be fine.

It’s just paying $10+ million to fire a guy for underperforming is a little irksome when you think what that money could have gone to.

Regardless of financial health, that’s still a significant amount of money."
LonghornNation,ffcyyoh,t1_ffck6gm,1579810156.0,"Donor restrictions with regard to terminating a coach’s contract?

I’ve seen donor restrictions to build x,y,z project in the law, but never any kind of “but only if you fire X coach” restriction.

Where did you get that information? If anything, the liquidated damages are provided the school for early termination, and they pull the funds from whatever source (I won’t pretend I know how UT funds a buyout).

Would you get the money back if the school doesn’t fire the coach? Do you get to stipulate the time frame when that have to fire the coach by? Does the school say, “okay, we’re firing X, let’s raise a fund calling for donations.”"
LonghornNation,ffc9pvd,t1_ffc8xsk,1579794739.0,"I mean yes, it's a drop in the bucket for UT. 

But I never really thought about that money being something substantial on campus, like our new museum.

Just crazy the amount you pay to fire a guy for underperforming, and what that money could have been used for instead. 

The point is that a poor hiring not only has an impact on the respective sports program, it also has a negative consequence on the school as a whole in what could have been a new computer lab, upgraded dorm, legacy museum etc."

LonghornNation,ffc5v0q,t3_esoyrf,1579792241.0,"Listened to a PodCast that mentioned how Shaka's buyout will be almost equivalent to our $14 million Longhorn legacy museum that we recently built at the stadium.

I never really thought about it this way, but it sucks how a coach not only causes a program to underperform, but then they also hurt the school just to remove them, when that money could be spend on permanent fixtures that will last decades.

I don't fault the coach for wanting as much as they can get (and blame can be on UT's lawyers for having such generous language).

Shaka is always mentioned as a ""good guy,"" but that kind of makes me despise him a little bit, even if I don't follow basketball at all."
LonghornNation,ff98hfq,t1_ff967k8,1579707278.0,"Agreed - especially for no pay. I was just curious what the incentive was, as it seems that time would be better spent doing so many other things rather than read through asinine comments/opinions."
