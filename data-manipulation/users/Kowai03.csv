funny,fffonqq,t3_et0f5e,1579888461.0,You made this as a joke OP but like others have said this would actually be really useful for pregnant women or those with mobility problems!
australia,fffevhk,t1_fff6rrv,1579882443.0,Can I ask you how you find nursing so far?
WTF,ffez1ma,t3_et4bx3,1579870945.0,Abs of fucking steel
babyloss,ffbl0j9,t3_esfm7q,1579770435.0,I went on antidepressants because I was scared I'd become truly suicidal. When I lost my baby I had thoughts of killing myself and I've never felt that before. Also I was having anxiety attacks. I still feel my grief and anxious but the antidepressants help take the edge off I guess. I don't really feel like I'm on anything but I hope they're helping.
babyloss,ff8x7fy,t1_ff8u6oi,1579699024.0,Yeah I definitely drink much more than I used to. It's not healthy but it is what it is.
babyloss,ff8nlg3,t3_es9e65,1579687578.0,"I think being resentful, jealous and angry at other parents and their children is 100% normal. There is no right or wrong when it comes to grief. 

It seems to be that men have a hard time reaching out for help.. Can you look for local support groups, any that have bereaved dads? Sometimes men need to talk to other fathers."
australia,ff3awnp,t3_erc6yr,1579537621.0,You're doing amazing. I just lost my grandmother to lung cancer which she got from smoking. I wish she had've quit smoking but none of us could convince her to. I'm glad you've quit!

loseit,fepyp2t,t1_fep3kwb,1579334808.0,"Subway is really formulaic and asking to gut the bread might be confusing to the subway artist. So I think keep that in mind and don't get angry if they get confused and maybe just describe what you want. 

Source: I used to work for Subway.

I think the veggie delight is the sub lowest in calories. Getting a salad is always a good option. Skip cheese, and avocado but all the normal salads are pretty good. Go for a plain bread like white. Sauces like honey mustard or sweet chilli are good options. 

I think the Subway website usually has all the nutritional information and even let's you design your own sub which can help with calculating calories."

pics,fegui0e,t1_fegmj0d,1579102819.0,"I got to a support group every week with other bereaved parents. To someone from the outside you might think that's depressing.. And of course none of us want to be part of this group... But being with others who understands helps so much. We're not wallowing in grief, we're in a space where we feel understood and supported and we can talk about our loved ones. It's the only time I can feel myself anymore because the world out there is where I have to hide my grief which will always be part of my life.

I assume that sub is similar. It's a safe space."

AskReddit,fegbnaf,t1_feefity,1579086514.0,"Sometimes it's about trying to detach from the feeling I think . Or accepting that you'll do your hobby despite feeling depressed. ""Yes I'm going to sit here and sew even though I feel like shit"".

5 mins later I'm usually into whatever I'm doing and feel a bit better. If not , I can always go watch Netflix or something."
australia,fe7n1kf,t1_fe5vhr1,1578916785.0,It's more important to provide accessibility to information. A combination of having closed captions and Auslan interpretation available is the best option to ensure important life saving information gets through.
australia,fe7mqpv,t1_fe5hba7,1578916619.0,"Because captions are in English. Not all Deaf people are fluent in English. I think that's especially true of older people. Also closed captions are done live I believe so sometimes there's errors. 

Auslan is also their first language. Auslan and English are not the same language."
australia,fe7mhz8,t1_fe74fz2,1578916499.0,The community courses are a great start! I also found the signbank dictionary website  is an awesome resource for learning new signs as well.
IAmA,fduvsga,t3_en3sxg,1578739647.0,I visited Nepal and did the Everest Base Camp hike. Its a beautiful country with awesome food and culture and the people were so friendly. I'd love to go back and spend more time seeing more of Kathmandu and other areas.
babyloss,fdjkhin,t3_elpqvq,1578475122.0,I'm so sorry for your loss :( I found that I had to breastpump. Just enough to take the pressure off when I needed it.
AskReddit,fdey3xp,t3_ekt5n3,1578349060.0,I once was sick and emailed in to let my manager know... Except I didn't realise that my email didn't go through (I sent it before work started then fell back asleep) When I next saw my manager I could've died but he just laughed and said he was glad I was okay.
AskUK,fd4u4cs,t3_ejvufw,1578171133.0,"London is a really cool city, I'm originally from a small Australian country town but currently live in London. If you ever get overwhelmed just stand to the side out of the way of the way and take a deep breath. You'll be fine.

You can always pop into a Pret for a coffee, they're everywhere, or just find a nice park to sit in. A pub is a good option for a sit as well if you need a break."
AskReddit,fd49few,t1_fd34z7r,1578165573.0,"My husband and I had the same experience. We were really nervous but we'd say hello and thank you in French, then ask if they spoke English. Everyone was really friendly. I think because we tried to be polite."
AskReddit,fd48zay,t1_fd2qbyc,1578165431.0,When I visited Paris people were actually really nice. I loved it there
unitedkingdom,fd1tffs,t3_ejo819,1578136535.0,I agree that immigration can have issues but I feel that there are better ways to deal with it than to stop freedom if movement. Like better support and accessibility to English courses and education for example.

Marriage,fcz19c1,t1_fcypi5i,1578091669.0,"I think that you need to sit down and talk with your wife. I think that you're on different pages when it comes to money, cleaning/chores and lots of little things.

I think I'm a little like your wife. I think that saving money is important and I definitely want a house one day, but I also like to spend money on holidays or decorations for my house because for me I like to create memories and to take pride in my home. I think that you need to find a compromise. Save money for also budget a little to spend. Whens the last time you invested in something nice for your house? Even something small like a photo in a frame? Maybe ask your wife to purchase things together, rather than going out and doing it herself that way you can budget together.

&#x200B;

I think with your tradition with your siblings - maybe your wife has some anxiety about being a good host. I know I am. I hate the idea of there not being enough food or drinks and I sometimes go overboard with that as wel. They're your siblings so you're more comfortable with them but maybe your wife wants to make a good impression?

&#x200B;

With your son, and with other issues you have, I think you really need to sit down and tell her how you feel and tell her these things are red flags for you. Nothing will change if you don't make yourself heard."
running,fcyy9o9,t1_fcwtx46,1578089741.0,Also Australian here. Threads like this make me wonder why Americans think Australia is more dangerous than their own country..
Marriage,fcx5kvm,t1_fcvd8ll,1578052169.0,My husband left me and all I've been trying to do is save my marriage but it's impossible when the other person doesn't want to. I still don't understand why.

AskUK,fcqpyb8,t1_fcpp16i,1577890309.0,That actually surprises me how much English has changed. I would've thought you'd have to go farther back to just not understand it at all!

AskReddit,fcobfvb,t1_fco74k1,1577828147.0,"I think a key to eating cheaply is being able to eat the same thing a lot.. But I cook a few different meals and freeze them.

If I want a change I'll cook something fresh. Tonight I made pizza (with heaps of leftovers) but I have dhal, curry, potato soup and two types of risotto in the freezer.

Freezer burn has never been a problem.."
AskReddit,fco0u8q,t1_fcn52nb,1577822061.0,Yeah I tend to have more vegetables than salad stuff
australia,fcmqgrh,t1_fcmpoxm,1577787157.0,Yeah I think it's easy for us to think of Auslan as just signed English but its its own distinct language.
IWantOut,fcmq2kq,t3_ehnkk8,1577786601.0,"I'm Australian and British. I was born and grew up in Australia and I've been living in the UK for about 2 years.

I have a British passport, my mum was born here but I definitely identify as Australian and others see me as Australian. I have an accent and I am culturally Australian.

No one tells me that I'm not British if I tell them I am a dual citizen but it's weird to think of myself as British. Living here there's so much I don't know about the culture even though its very similar to Australia. I think its one of those things where I am and I'm also not British. People mostly just treat me like an Aussie expat."
australia,fcmon8h,t1_fcmk3iv,1577784563.0,Yes but not all Deaf people are fluent in English. Auslan is their language and should be represented.
australia,fcmolip,t1_fcmiyky,1577784495.0,You can do uncredited community courses for about $200 each if I recall properly. There's Auslan 1 and 2 (maybe 3 as well). They're a great place to start. You can do them either over a couple of weeks or as a weekend course.
AskReddit,fcmo7cz,t1_fcmbima,1577783946.0,"Cook in bulk and freeze it. I'm on my own and my freezer is full of risotto, dhal, red curry, soup etc I cook large meals then just take out what I need. Its way cheaper than eating out"
AskReddit,fcmnzj1,t1_fcmevf0,1577783641.0,"Half an hour for a basic meal at home. Stir fry is easy to cook quick. You cook as you chop ingredients to save time. Other stuff like dhal or soup or a roast you can prep, set on to cook then walk away from and do other stuff as long as you check it occasionally. So they'll take longer but it's almost set and forget."
AskReddit,fck2cup,t3_eh8gs2,1577714485.0,I think it smells and tastes bad. It's very sickly. It's great when you're just nice and relaxed but the paranoia sucks. I'm very 50/50 about it

I couldn't eat at all for a few weeks after losing my son.. Anything beyond toast was too much effort for months. I just lost the will to look after myself and I'm slowly getting there.."
unitedkingdom,fc9yqag,t3_ego2b7,1577560208.0,Can you call your doctor for a same day appointment? I did that when I was having issues with anxiety/depression/thoughts of self halm and was seen the same day. The doctor gave me a call back to assess me and had me in ASAP. If I'd tried to just book normally I would've had to wait a week or so.
melbourne,fc872f7,t1_fc7op7d,1577528320.0,"If they're Lune croissants yeah they're really good. I've only had them twice, when they were located in Elwood. It's kind of a novelty to get up early and wait for the croissants. They serve you coffee in line and there's this kind of excited atmosphere. When you get a box of croissants, there's different kinds, they really are very good.

I wouldn't buy them all the time but it was an experience."
