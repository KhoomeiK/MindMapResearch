This is a painful wake up call. The first thing you must do is accept that your relationship with your ex is completely over, and stop thinking about how to win him back. It’s unconstructive for you, and it’s disrespectful bordering on abusive (depending on how far you’ve taken this) to him. The next and most important thing is for you to find a trauma-based therapist and work to unravel what was done to you, and move forward in a healthy manner.

“I hate that it reflects poorly on me that I have a bad relationship with my mother.” 

It doesn’t! The only people that might have that opinion are young, naive, or hopelessly bigoted/narrow minded/living in a previous century. Getting older shows you that there are almost as many ways to experience life and family as there are people, and judging anyone else’s lived experience is impossible. 

If anyone on social media posts about how much they love their mom, they’re lucky! They won the DNA lottery! Be happy for them, don’t resent their good fortune, because into every life some rain must fall. They will come to know suffering, sorrow, betrayal and brutality. It might not come from those that gave them life, but sure as the sun’s coming up tomorrow, life is coming for them too. Life comes for everyone. 


> ""It's so great that you love your parents. Speaks volumes of you as a person."" And the comment got like a thousand likes. I thought it was a very unfair statement!!

They’re not being unfair, don’t take this sentiment personally. This is a person that hasn’t done a lot of living. They can only speak from their own limited experience. What they’re saying is no reflection on you. Fret not, and put their opinion out of your mind, because they’re naive and don’t really understand how the world works. 

>I suspect these people think...

Train yourself to stop thinking about what these people think, and put all of your energy, effort, and thoughts on personal development and living your best life. Seriously, do yourself a huge favor and let this go. 

> I feel frustrated that I would seem like a bad person because I don't love (or even like) my mother

You seem like a survivor! Drop the frustration like a hot potato! You deserve your best! Your best thoughts, words, and actions! You don’t owe the world affection for your mother.
