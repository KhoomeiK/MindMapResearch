When you're sleeping, saliva stops flowing as much and you stop drinking water, so any sugars and such you've had just sit in your teeth feeding cavities. Also, for your teeth, the amount of time they're in contact with sugars matters more than how much sugar you're having. 

If your teeth start hurting or aching, it can mean there's already serious damage that will be really pricey to fix. Don't wait til things are too late to start caring about your teeth.

- go easy with products. It's easier to apply too little then apply more than it is to apply too much then try to cover it or remove and redo it

-know what colours match your skin tone because tones make a huge difference

- products expire. Generally it's 12 months after opening, though google for specific dates for seperate products

- remove waterproof makeup with oil products (cleansing oil, oil makeup remover). Nothing is more frustrating than trying to remove waterproof makeup with a remover not meant for it

- take the time to research products and how safe the ingredients are ahead of time if possible, or just read the ingredients. Alcohol and parabens are bad for the skin I've heard, so taking a few seconds to read ingredients is better than wasting money on something that isn't great for your skin"

I've got some tips for you though. The thing a lot of people do with off key notes is record yourself singing, and if you go off key, sing that part again. In the end, you'll have a bunch of audio bits and you can just edited them together as long as the transitions aren't noticable. Then if you want to record a video of yourself singing, lip sync to the audio. Just don't make things seem sketchy like your voice sounding close to the mic in the audio but the mic being 4 feet away from you in the video. 

Another way is to download software that can correct the pitch of your voice. It may sound robotic if you go way off though and a lot of people don't like that sound if it's obviously not a stylistic choice."
singing,feqxbsf,t3_eqayqh,1579347151.0,"TL;DR: The feelings of hopelessness, wanting to give up, embarrassment is completely normal and everyone goes through them. It will be tough, but just keep pushing on and find the way you learn best. Your singing really isn't half bad, especially that vibrato. 

Call me weird, but I wish I could give you a hug D: I've been there and ithe feeling of hoplessness sucks. Thought my voice was too garbage to ever improve and accepted that ""fact"" for years as I couldn't even sing in key the slightest. 

To be honest, learning any new hobby is always the most difficult when first starting out because that's when you know nothing, have so much to learn, and make progress more slowly. But trust me, progress does eventually speed up the more you know. Anyone can learn to sing. The only ""but"" is that some people take longer to learn and perfect things, though being good at singing is still possible. 

I got discouraged as well watching YouTube videos for help but getting frustrated I couldn't get things right and didn't understand, but that's part of the learning process. I personally learn best just by experimenting with my voice rather than listening to explanations because they always confused me and I learned the long way that not one way of learning works for everyone. Someone may find a video or website or explaination helpful while another may not. You'll only find out by trying everything out. I would be like ""mixed voice?? I know it's inbetween chest and head voice and it sounds like this, but how do I know I'm hitting it??""

The feeling of ""I can't do this. I want to give up"" is completely normal and it does feel really embarrassing at times knowing you sound awful, but you'll only improve if you practise what you sound awful at. You just gotta push through all those thoughts even if you really don't want to. I've had those feelings tons of times learning how to belt (sing loudly), sing with chest voice, do vibrato, riff and runs, and pretty much everything. But I pushed through it and I'm glad I did because now everything's so much easier to do and actually sounds nice. 

The thing with vocal lessons is that not everyone matches well with every vocal teacher or coach or lesson. Sometimes it's the way they explain things that confuses you, or a teacher/coach believes there is only one way to sing that you don't agree with, or they don't explain things enough etc. If after a decent amount of lessons you feel frustrated or like your not making even small steps towards progress or they belittle you for making mistakes, it might be time to go elsewhere. 

About your singing, it's actually pretty good. I haven't heard the original song, but you're staying on key most of the time, you don't sound nervous, and that vibrato sounds really good and I'm not saying this just to be nice because I'm not that type of person. If you said you were a complete beginner, I'd be thinking you were lying. 

Some quick general tips I have for you are:

- learn as much as you can about singing. You can't improve if you don't know how to improve

- record yourself often. You can't improve even if you had knowledge because you wouldn't hear what mistakes you were making since our ears ""autotune"" our voices 

- push through no matter how difficult things get. You will make progress if you ignore those feelings of doubt, hopelessness, and embarrassment 

- know when to give your voice a break. If you've overdone it, your throat will hurt even when you're not saying or singing anything and you'll lose some control over your voice/not sing as well. Give it a day or two if you've overdone it. If it still hurts, wait some more. Though go see a doctor if it has been a very long time of no singing but your throat still hurts. 

- know that it will take hundreds, if not thousands of hours of practice to be really skilled at singing. It's normal to need to practise a lot to improve. It just feels like a long time because no one ever records the hours of when they're practising. We just see the final result."
singing,feqp487,t3_eq5ce2,1579344479.0,"If your voice and throat feels fine, then you're most likely fine to start singing again. Your own body will show signs if your voice is too fatigued such as voice cracking with high notes, very breathy voice not on purpose, your throat continues to hurt even when not singing etc."
singing,feqon11,t3_eqax0n,1579344282.0,"I had this issue a lot when first starting out, but thankfully not as often anymore. What personally helped me was playing a song and singing without paying any attention to how I sounded like to get myself relaxed and distracted. Then when I got comfortable, I would lower the volume slightly and sing so I can hear my voice a bit. Then take out one ear bud, then no earbuds, then with no ear buds and even quieter volume. The end goal was being able to sing relaxed without music. 

Hope this helps."
singing,feqn8dw,t3_eqbtsn,1579343838.0,"You need to learn the basics of singing first before getting to the fancier stuff like riffs and runs because if you don't have a solid foundation, nothing will sound good.

With that song specifically, I think you should research more about volume control, singing with breath, singing on pitch, and singing nasally if you wanna be extra as Melanie sings nasally on the word ""honest"". I don't mean to offend you listing all these. Singing just has a lot more to it than what beginners may know at first. 

Once you have the basics down and have a good foundation, you can pretty much sing any song good even if it won't be with other complicated techniques. Overall, just search up more on the stuff I listed, practise, and I'm sure you will improve.


Edit: By the way, a random tip I have is to sing the word ""honest"" and other words you have sung in bits all the way without chopping it up. It sounds like that because Melanie sings parts of the word more quietly and switches from normal volume to quiet, normal then quiet again. It isn't because she sings the word stopping between each half second, and that's what I meant by volume control.

singing,fdyc6sc,t3_enczxz,1578778224.0,"With learning how to sing online, you need to be sure to browse a ton of videos to not only gain knowledge, but to compare how different people are explaining things. If you've got the information but the way someone explains it is still confusing to you, you're not going to make as much progress.

Stay away from YouTube comments. There are tons of people there who say the most random things about singing and say it is ""true facts"". Unless they give a link to where they got their information, take everything with a grain of salt. 

Be sure to practice lots and don't be discouraged if it takes you a few years to see a drastic improvement. The information on the internet is usually more general (unless you know exactly what to search for), so self learning is definately going to be a bit of a longer process than if you had someone to help you out. 

Record yourself often to hear if you're making mistakes. What you hear is an ""autotuned"" version of what you sound like, so it's really misleading. To hear themselves, some put their face onto a wall for the sound waves to reflect off it, some put books by the sides of their ears, and I personally put in earbuds with no music to hear myself, but the best way to go is to simply record yourself. It'll be embarrassing, but you have to get through it. Even if you had all the knowledge in the world, you can't fix mistakes you didn't know you were making."

I ended up hating being with my cousin because I'd have to spend 12 hours each ""play date"" entertaining her and cleaning up after her. I wasn't even allowed to be a regular 6 year old kid because I had to be a role model for her, so I couldn't need or want anything around her. She cries? My fault. She gets hurt? My fault. She gets bored? My fault."

TooAfraidToAsk,fdlj0m6,t1_fdlgh57,1578525086.0,"It's true psychological pain can be treated and even cured, but there are also instances where the pain can only be managed and the pain would have to be carried with throughout the rest of that person's life. It feels like you're then forced to live a life you never chose to live even if things are going really wrong, so the only way out if the solution isn't easy to do is to kill yourself which isn't nearly as pleasant as just being put down at a hospital."
TooAfraidToAsk,fdlijx7,t3_elnjjg,1578524790.0,"It could be a mix of everything. Some thinking it's cool, some for pity, some because they think they have depression but don't, some actually having depression and use social media as a way to temporarily feel better. 

Everyone has different reasons for talking about depression, but personally for me, people aren't running around yelling ""I HAVE DEPRESSION. IF YOU DO TOO, LETS BE FRIENDS"" so real life feels really lonely if no one in your life has depression or knows about it which is one of the reasons why many end up venting on the internet, hoping to find someone who really understands them and a friend too. Also, social anxiety sometimes is paired with depression which makes being social difficult as hell and we end up having little to no friends and relying on the internet to find friends."
TooAfraidToAsk,fdlheo8,t3_elr9xh,1578524073.0,"Not in developed countries because the bacteria in your poo then gets transferred to your hand and *everything* else your hand touches which is unsanitary and can get you sick if you consume food with the bacteria from your poo on it. Though if you don't have toilet paper or a fancy bidets, I guess that would be normal."

TooAfraidToAsk,fdlgptn,t3_elq87u,1578523649.0,"Canadian born Chinese here. I know you're probably asking for those living in an Asian country, but I can only speak about my family. We do talk about white people being racist, but we don't talk about ourselves being racist which I find funny because anytime there's someone in our lives who isn't east asian (or white when watching tv), there's always at least one person who feels the need to point it out and laugh. This issue is practically nonexistent in my family because no one sees it as an issue. I do believe younger generations are gradually being more open towards other ethnicities though than the previous generation."
