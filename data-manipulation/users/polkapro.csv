All of them?  What about the guy in Charlottesville?

Why is Trump systematically trying to make it more difficult for people of color to emigrate to the US?  Why is he trying to fuck anyone over that is here as a result of DACA?

I guess the build the wall sticker is a direct Trump slogan so it's not really a question who this guy would support politically.... But hey, he's a Trump supporter so he's a nice person

AdvancedRunning,ff4er81,t1_ff3jzlv,1579561868.0,I think this was a full out effort.  I'm not sure about what percentage of max hr this is for him but given his training and overall profile of an endurance athlete I would guess he can sustain a higher max % of HR than most.  75% gives him max of 200 but he's 30 so a more accurate estimate would be 190 which makes his effort 80% which would be more consistent with racing a half marathon in about an hour.  Now for someone like Walmsley he may even be able to sustain a higher max heart rate for an hour given his profile and training history it is reasonable to think he might have a lower max HR than even 190.

Rowing,ff3cpxn,t1_ff30ipn,1579538534.0,"Here is the thing, I really know nothing about training for rowing but I would think the core concepts are the same.  Middle distance runners will usually have a long run once a week or so that is anywhere from 90 minutes to 2 hours.  The idea for mid-distance and distance runners far out (\~3+ months) from your target race is to focus primarily on building an aerobic 'base' since aerobic conditioning takes much longer to properly develop when compared to anaerobic.  This isn't to say you don't have days that are more intense but it might be something like a 70 minute run where you progressively get faster and are running at threshold by the end of the run.  Even in the sharpening/specificity phase for pure middle distance runners they will continue their long run of 90+ minutes.

A big reason runners don't run longer than 2 hours is the impact and risk of injury increases.  Given the low impact of cycling their long rides are something like 6+ hours.  So I guess intuitively I think you need a long effort every week to 10 days or so.  But keep in mind your source, admittedly I don't really know much about rowing.  I'm only learning some technique and doing it on a very recreational level because it is a great workout and I have access to a concept 2 right now.

Another thing to consider is your age, you are still young.  I wasn't running over 90 minutes too often at your age as it takes time to build up to running enough overall mileage to justify a long run of that distance."

Rowing,ff2dfer,t3_ep9all,1579501651.0,"Here is what I would say coming from a running background and almost no experience with rowing.  Most of your long term improvements are going to come from low intensity high duration workouts (UT2? you guys call it?). I know 7 minutes of rowing or any aerobic sport seems pretty high intensity but the reality is most of our power is coming from our aerobic capacity so we need to pay a lot of attention to this system.  To fully train this system I think we need some low intensity days alternating between rowing and riding or whatever you choose but long enough so that we metabolically switch over to burning fat instead of glucose.  We aren't going to do this with a 70 minute workout.  It might take more like 2 to 3 hours or even more, but I think doing low end aerobic activity continuously over long periods of will ultimately be much more beneficial than trying to hitting high intensity intervals and such.

I might be wrong and admittedly I don't know much about about training for rowing but I'm just trying look at it from the perspective of how a runner training for a 3km (similarly time spent as rowing 2km) might approach things.  This isn't to say you don't need the high intensity training as you absolutely do.  It's just that getting the most out of anaerobic training doesn't need as much time to reap  benefits."

AdvancedRunning,ff4er81,t1_ff3jzlv,1579561868.0,I think this was a full out effort.  I'm not sure about what percentage of max hr this is for him but given his training and overall profile of an endurance athlete I would guess he can sustain a higher max % of HR than most.  75% gives him max of 200 but he's 30 so a more accurate estimate would be 190 which makes his effort 80% which would be more consistent with racing a half marathon in about an hour.  Now for someone like Walmsley he may even be able to sustain a higher max heart rate for an hour given his profile and training history it is reasonable to think he might have a lower max HR than even 190.

Rowing,ff3cpxn,t1_ff30ipn,1579538534.0,"Here is the thing, I really know nothing about training for rowing but I would think the core concepts are the same.  Middle distance runners will usually have a long run once a week or so that is anywhere from 90 minutes to 2 hours.  The idea for mid-distance and distance runners far out (\~3+ months) from your target race is to focus primarily on building an aerobic 'base' since aerobic conditioning takes much longer to properly develop when compared to anaerobic.  This isn't to say you don't have days that are more intense but it might be something like a 70 minute run where you progressively get faster and are running at threshold by the end of the run.  Even in the sharpening/specificity phase for pure middle distance runners they will continue their long run of 90+ minutes.

A big reason runners don't run longer than 2 hours is the impact and risk of injury increases.  Given the low impact of cycling their long rides are something like 6+ hours.  So I guess intuitively I think you need a long effort every week to 10 days or so.  But keep in mind your source, admittedly I don't really know much about rowing.  I'm only learning some technique and doing it on a very recreational level because it is a great workout and I have access to a concept 2 right now.

Another thing to consider is your age, you are still young.  I wasn't running over 90 minutes too often at your age as it takes time to build up to running enough overall mileage to justify a long run of that distance."

Rowing,ff2dfer,t3_ep9all,1579501651.0,"Here is what I would say coming from a running background and almost no experience with rowing.  Most of your long term improvements are going to come from low intensity high duration workouts (UT2? you guys call it?). I know 7 minutes of rowing or any aerobic sport seems pretty high intensity but the reality is most of our power is coming from our aerobic capacity so we need to pay a lot of attention to this system.  To fully train this system I think we need some low intensity days alternating between rowing and riding or whatever you choose but long enough so that we metabolically switch over to burning fat instead of glucose.  We aren't going to do this with a 70 minute workout.  It might take more like 2 to 3 hours or even more, but I think doing low end aerobic activity continuously over long periods of will ultimately be much more beneficial than trying to hitting high intensity intervals and such.

I might be wrong and admittedly I don't know much about about training for rowing but I'm just trying look at it from the perspective of how a runner training for a 3km (similarly time spent as rowing 2km) might approach things.  This isn't to say you don't need the high intensity training as you absolutely do.  It's just that getting the most out of anaerobic training doesn't need as much time to reap  benefits."

They are almost never expecting or bracing for a hit so when they do get hit the likelihood of getting injured is higher.  On top of that if they get hit they can become a bit rattled/apprehensive in a position where you need incredible focus and reflexes.  Most teams only dress two keepers and their top keeper would usually be playing.
