relationship_advice,ffiputf,t1_ffiop6f,1579979738.0,He specifically says he’s angry she spends 4-6 hours running marathons on the weekends and he’s stuck looking after the kids. That doesn’t sound supportive so it shouldn’t be a surprise she would find someone who is supportive of what she is passionate about attractive. She didn’t cheat and she was honest with her husband so I think the relationship is salvageable IF they both want it to be. But that’s a big IF. Relationships are complicated and we only ever hear one side of the story in these posts.

AmItheAsshole,ffikfv1,t1_ffihw1o,1579976002.0,"that doesn't mean it's free. I'm curious about other expenses...how long have you paid your own cell phone or are you on a family plan? How about car insurance? Did you parents every provide you with a car? Did your parents cosign any of your student loans? Do you use any family signs for Netflix, Hulu etc... I'm just wondering if you truly support yourself or are still getting support.

I think you would be the asshole for cutting of your parents over what is essentially a small amount of money, especially compared to how much they have likely spent getting you to this point. 

When I was in your situation, my parents had me calculate how much my refund would be if I filed on my own and then gave me that amount. I then refiled as a dependent because the amount my parents saved claiming me as a dependent was significantly higher. Win/win for everyone.  There is almost always a compromise, especially when it comes to money. You will eventually miss your family a lot more than you'd miss $1000..."

I agree with this wholeheartedly. I'm sure he's angry and hurt, but this sentence seems like he sees himself as the only one working in the relationship. Especially if he's resentful of looking after the kids on weekends? Does she not ever deserve a break? Some counseling and a commitment by both parties to work on their marriage and invest in their partner is desperately needed."

relationship_advice,ffcfws1,t3_esufvn,1579798595.0,"I am a mother of a daughter who wants to be a doctor and I hope she can find a partner that will support her the way your SO has. Why would you consider leaving because his goals have changed? You say you couldn't have done it without him, so had he been on the same timeline as you he wouldn't have been able to support you because he would have been so involved in his own success. The same goes for the future. How are you going to make it through residency, fellowship and a demanding career with someone who has the same if not more demands and stress? You say you want a family- it sounds like he will make a wonderful spouse and father. I hope you are prepared for how difficult it will be to be a doctor and a mom, there will be a lot of sacrifice ahead and having a spouse that can focus on continuing to support you and your future children will be so important. 

You kind of make him out to sound like some kind of deadbeat because he's not a doctor, but he's got 4 degrees? He sounds like a keeper to me, although I do think therapy would help, probably for you too. Why is it so important for you to be married to a doctor? Is this really about the relationship or the way you want to be viewed in the world? Is he having so much anxiety about the MCAT and becoming a doctor because he knows your relationship depends on it?"
AmItheAsshole,ffc7iyx,t3_estdfm,1579793336.0,"NAH what you did is actually a good strategy for conflict management. In marriage counseling we were told to do exactly this to avoid saying anything you would regret later. However, it should be discussed beforehand so both partners are on the same page. During an argument isn't a great time to set boundaries; try doing it beforehand i.e. talk about what happened and make a decision together how a similar experience will be handled in the future."

NAH there is nothing wrong with what you said, but you saying that you have to be a certain type of person was probably meant towards yourself, but she probably took it as a reflection on her. She was likely expecting you to tell her what a wonderful mother she would be and what she heard was that you don't think she will be.

that being said, parenting is hard and I think it's good to be honest with potential parents. I hope things will get easier for you!"
relationship_advice,ff97zzx,t3_esc6xe,1579706964.0,"hey, listen. You wouldn't go to her and say ""in order to stay in this relationship you have to have sex with me and be on the pill.""

so it's not ok for her to expect you to not have a physical relationship, or not use birth control/be at risk for an unwanted pregnancy in order to be in the relationship.

be honest and tell her. She might be upset because often people can only see things from their perspective, but you deserve to have a fulfilling relationship on your own terms as much as she does."

TrueOffMyChest,ff52rr6,t1_ff51woj,1579578653.0,I agree with most of what you said especially paragraph 3 but you even use the word life when describing a miscarriage. My point is most of these terms are pretty interchangeable when discussing pregnancy so I don’t  think it’s helpful to try and split hairs when discussing abortion. Pregnant women don’t usually say “my fetus is kicking”.
AmItheAsshole,ff51itb,t1_ff511n9,1579577709.0,"a UTMA account can hold many types of assets, including stocks. A minor can't legally own stocks so that doesn't really answer the question of what the will stated about how the funds were to be held and/or used."
TrueOffMyChest,ff518vd,t3_ero7pr,1579577502.0,"so I am a pro-choice woman and I don't think these posts are really helpful. To claim a 6 week old fetus isn't a baby is pretty disingenuous, I mean does that mean that a pregnant woman shouldn't be happy or excited until <<insert gestational age>>. Does that mean if a woman has a miscarriage the response should be ""why are you upset? It's just a period!""

everyone understands there is an emotional connection to a pregnancy, obviously not always positive but to expect the abortion debate to be framed by ""it's not a child"" is never going to find any common ground and isn't really this issue. 

and yes, I'm prepared to be downvoted."
AmItheAsshole,ff4zfvi,t1_ff4umjf,1579576173.0,this is the correct answer. if the money went into a UTMA account with his parents as the custodians using the funds to purchase a house that OP lived in is a legally allowable use of the funds.
