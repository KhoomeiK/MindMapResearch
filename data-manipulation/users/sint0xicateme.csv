Which lead me to [chirality](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/spycatcher/201605/chirality-look-emotional-asymmetry-the-face):

>Animosity, anger, fear, as well as other emotions, appear freely on both sides of the face as we truly experience them. However, when there is suppression of these emotions, when there is an attempt to beguile others as to how we really feel, or there are hidden issues or feelings, oftentimes, we see that emotion displayed only on one side of the face and not the other. The fact that we are seeing a chiral emotional display should serve as a warning that something is wrong.

>A chiral display is often perceived subconsciously and lets us know something is odd. When we see facial chirality as a result of multiple emotions, this lack of symmetry should make us more alert as to what is the cause for this behavior. Is there a substantive issue that is in conflict or is being suppressed?"

We patronize them for their incompleteness, for their tragic fate for having taken form so far below ourselves. And therein do we err. 

For the animal shall not be measured by man. In a world older and more complete than ours, they move finished and complete, gifted with the extension of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. 

They are not brethren, they are not underlings: they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendour and travail of the earth.

**Silva signed a deal to end deforestation** in 2009. **The Amazon Fund was created in 2008 to collect donations for non-reimbursable investments in preventing, monitoring, and fighting deforestation while promoting forest conservation in the Amazon biome. It is managed by BNDES, Brazil's state-owned development bank. Notably, [it was created by a presidential decree issued by former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Bolsonaro's political archenemy.](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/amazon-burning-bolsonaro-fanned-flames)**

>Environmentalists like Silva, a minister under former left-wing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, say Bolsonaro's push to open the Amazon to development is emboldening industry, illegal loggers and ranchers to clear land and exploit natural resources.

>**""The Bolsonaro government has broken down all the environmental policies that were created throughout the decades,""** said Silva, who was born into a rubber-tapping community in the Amazon

Also, Bolsonaro has access to tons more science showing why what he's doing is detrimental to his country, and the world at large. Information the previous leaders weren't privy to. And he is doing this on purpose, something Da Silva isn't guilty of. 

For example, **this year's fires broke many of Brazil's [previous records](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/08/21/record-breaking-number-of-fires-burn-in-brazils-amazon.html)**

[Amazon burning: Brazil reports highest forest fires since 2010]
(https://uk.mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUKKCN1VA1U4)

>The unprecedented surge in wildfires has occurred since Bolsonaro took office in January vowing to develop the Amazon region for farming and mining, ignoring international concern over increased deforestation.

>""I used to be called Captain Chainsaw. **Now I am Nero, setting the Amazon aflame.** But it is the season of the queimada,"" Bolsonaro told reporters.

He knows he's doing a bad, but profitable, thing, and he revels in it. Da Silva didn't sell the Amazon to corporations to be destroyed.

Edit: Maybe you should Google 'Forbes Bolsonaro' to see propaganda in action and how many positive and glowing articles there are on this fascist piece of shit."

>To which I might first respond, ""what do you mean, 'what if'?"" Everything they tell us to do is part of their core strategy, but also shouldn't the determination of whether it's wrong to call someone a fascist depend, at least a little, on whether they actually are one? 

>But that question can't be posed with in values neutral governance. **Values neutral governance wants rules that are correct in every scenario, regardless of context.** If the left and the right stand across the aisle yelling, ""you're the fascist"", at each other, values neutral governance can condemn both, or neither, but it can't determine who's the fascist without taking context into account.

>**Everyone can see what the alt-right is doing, but no one knows how to oppose it within the rules we've set.** And they never will, an action has no intrinsic value wholly separate from its outcome.

>The Kentucky clerk breaking the law by refusing to sign a legal gay marriage license is wrong. And the California clerk - breaking the law by signing in a legal gay marriage license - is right. 

>**There is a moral imperative to disobey rules when following those rules does not lead to Justice.**

>Some say rules are what separate us from the animals, but I've always preferred the adage that what separates us from the animals is that we have a conscience. 

>***This isn't to say we shouldn't act better than our opposition. But that maybe we shouldn't let the people 'going low' define for us what counts as 'going high' - and to consider that pursuing Justice rather than manners may be 'taking the high road'.*** To my understanding, being a grown-up sometimes means taking a kids toys away until they can behave themselves. It's clear from looking at Republicans that you can govern on your values and be successful. It is just a question of which values you govern on. 

That is why the right is so successful."
politics,fc6rt4h,t1_fc67y4i,1577487850.0,"Haha Hillary is the queen of neoliberalism and is only seen as 'pretty left' by people who confuse liberalism with leftism. The only reason she could be considered 'pretty left' is because the US' Overton Window is so hopelessly skewed right.
I'm a Bernie supporter, but as an actual leftist, even he isn't as left as I'd like. Hillary and the DNC royally screwed him out of the nomination because 'it was her turn!'

(Also, the country didn't choose Trump, the Electoral College did; Hillary won with 3.3 Million more votes than Trump (2.1% more of the popular vote). There is no 'pretty left' in US politics, now or in 2016, unfortunately.)

And about the Lo2E: According to a pre 2016 election [CNN poll](https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/04/politics/poll-results-general-election-matchup/index.html), when asked if their vote was more to express support for Hillary Clinton or more to express opposition to Donald Trump, the result was that by 51-48, more Clinton voters said their vote would be more to express their opposition to Trump than their support for Clinton. Among Trump supporters, the negativity was even higher. Only 43 percent said their vote would be more “for” Trump compared to 57 percent who said it would be more against Clinton.

Many democracies in the world have systems that make it much more likely that a voter can vote for a person or a party that they actually like, and still hope their vote might make a difference, rather than being forced to spend their precious vote on a lesser of two evils. And yes, Minneapolis and St. Paul city elections use ranked-choice-voting and there are other alternative systems in which a plurality winner does not take all. But none of those systems are in place for U.S. presidential elections.

How many of those Democrats who told CNN-ORC that they will vote for Clinton if that’s the only way for them to vote against Trump were really saying that they’d feel a lot better about their vote if they could vote for Sanders? And how many of those might stay home if they can’t vote for Bernie? Bernie Sanders supporters were being pressured and shamed into voting for Clinton. This “pragmatic” Lo2E tactic may work for the short term, but it will just embolden establishment politics and undermine future chances for real progressive change.

Even if your vote could have helped to defeat Trump, you’re clearly telling Democratic party elites they can confidently betray your concerns as long as they offer you someone marginally better than the Republican alternative. Where will it end? The Democratic Party will just continue to betray progressive causes with impunity. 

And the right sticks together because when there are only two parties, the Democrats have to have a huge tent, with tons of ideological differences within the party. And the Democrats' pleads for 'civility' and their whole 'You go low, we go' high bullshit just makes the Republicans say, 'You go high, we'll go low'. This approach isn't exactly working when one side brazenly ignores the law and all SOP. 

From Innuendo Studios on why the right is so successful:

>The modern American Democrat is in an unenviable position. You need 2 things to win an election: **Votes and Funding**.

>And there are a number of things that voters care passionately about and that they have no hope of ever getting from Republicans. But unfortunately for Democrats, they are the exact things big-ticket donors despise; which is why Democrats in very securely blue districts, who tend to run unopposed, are the ones most willing to talk about them. **The left is, in fact, a very heterogeneous group with a mountain of conflicting interests, and decades of infighting. So it's very hard to appeal to all of them** ***and wealthy donors***

>Republicans really don't have this problem, or at least, they don't have it as bad. Despite many, in some ways, even more passionate and fundamental differences, **conservatives value loyalty and in-group cohesion.** And this keeps them coming together every 4 years in a surprisingly unified voting block. **It also helps that they fucking hate anyone to the left of them.** And most would sooner vote for Republican that they despise than for any kind of Democrat. 

>And, lucky for them, **the things Conservative voters want are much more aligned with corporate interests**.

>So building a coalition on the left is a lot of work, and faced with this challenge, **there is a liberal tendency to turn away from policy and focus instead on 'process' - generally uncontroversial things like bipartisanship, compromise, decorum.** And, fair enough, the absence of these things in Washington over the years is constantly something that everyone left of center is sick of, but they're not things Democrats can make happen all by themselves. And, more to the point, ***none of them are results. They are means.***

>**A 'willingness to compromise' is not a position.** And ***when you over focus on how you should go about things,*** and ***not what things you should go about doing***, it fosters a certain philosophy about government **that is both highly flawed and highly exploitable**:
The valuing of means at the expense of needs. 

>Most people would say that """"the ends justify the means"" is a crap moral philosophy. And Democrats would agree. ***But liberals often over correct to the point where thinking about the ends at all is thought of as,*** in a vague reflective kind of way, ***innately immoral***. 

>There's a very 'Enlightenment' way of thinking that implies that *'with the right means, the ends take care of themselves',* and, with those means, *immoral behavior becomes functionally impossible.*
This thinking isn't inherent to Liberal philosophy, but is rather one pattern of thought Liberals will often slip into. 

>But **this idea of the 'perfect system', that can only spit out Justice, is how Liberals tend think about Democracy. This is 'Values Neutral Governance'** and you can see why it would appeal when you're trying to sum all the demands placed on a politician. **Under this thinking, you don't need to engage with the needs and desires of your constituents, your donors, or even your opposition - because if democracy is working, everyone deserving will get what they need as a matter of course. That's what Democracy is for: to divine what is right out of a cacophony of different voices.**

>**Under this line of thinking, it is okay for people, even people with power, to have bad ideas - because bad ideas will always be outnumbered by good ideas, checks and balances.**
Even you can have 'bad ideas', **provided you commit to obeying a just set of rules, only Justice will ever be produced by these rules**. 

>***And you can see how utterly paralyzing it can be when half the participants of that system refuse to play by those rules.***

>Values neutral governance is an engine that only runs by mutual consent. The system is supposed to be 'self repairing'; If the rules are broken in a way that the machine doesn't have specific contingencies for, you can write those contingencies - but you'd have to pass them through Congress or the courts. As in: *you need the cooperation of the people who are violating the rules.*

>**All that's left then is to fix the system without their approval.** ***But that's going outside the rules. That's thinking about ends.*** And **to Democrats, the system is morality itself. You can't go outside it and still behave 'ethically'.** ***If the problem is people breaking the rules, Democrats believe you can't fix that by breaking then further.***

>At this point a Democratic senator will usually throw up both hands and say, ""fuck it then, I'm going to do what the Republicans should be doing. I'm going to follow decorum and look for compromise. I will not be responsible for the degradation of our governmental system. Maybe everything still goes to shit, but nobody complained that I didn't do my job.""

>And once upon a time, I think they genuinely believed that this was 'leading by example'. But I don't think today they are under any illusions that this will right the vessel - **Appealing to the Republicans better nature is a lost cause. But Democrats keep doing it, because on some level they genuinely believe that even when it accomplishes nothing, following the rules to the bitter end is the 'noble' thing to do**: The Captain 'goes down with the ship'. It is an understatement to say that this is very frustrating."

cringe,fc5akot,t1_fc4r76g,1577451166.0,"It's correct grammar. If someone calls a woman and asks to speak to that woman, the correct response would be, 'this is she'. 

Take latin for example (in latin, the rules about which words go in which cases (nominative/accusative/etc) are about identical to our own, but they are easier to see because of case endings. In latin, a Mary would say ""ego sum Mary"" or ""I am Mary"", and the same grammatical markings would appear on ""haec est ea"" or ""this is she.""

The verb “to be” acts as a linking verb, equating subject and object. So this is she and she is this; “she” and “this” are one and the same, interchangeable, and to be truly interchangeable they must both play the same grammatical role—that of the subject.

I'm super into linguistics, but I also think prescriptivism is bullshit. As long as someone understands what you're saying, which is the point of communication/language, then it is correct. 

TL;DR: Yes, in some cases, 'she' is a correct way for a woman to refer to herself, but it isn't really used that much anymore."

Can't really blame folks when it was a coordinated effort on all fronts to sell them sugar filled shit, when they also had no access to the studies or the internet to guide them.

Edit: we still have the sugar issue while also having corn syrup in everything as well. Lobbyists for both products have gotten themselves subsidies to grow more corn and sugar cane.
