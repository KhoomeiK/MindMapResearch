Mother smoked, when I seemed just slightly not comfortable that she was blowing the breath of death into my face whilst I was still eating I had always to hear ""YoU wIlL sMoKe sOmEdAy tOo!"". No, I won't and I haven't. And I also want to support companies that make me addicted to their useless shit (right now ignoring the sweet fact I like to drink coke but I can qUiT EvEryTiMe)."

memes,fekgp31,t1_fejiven,1579199675.0,"The soot from the fires are condensation nuclei for rain. The country is surrounded by water and it depends on how the winds are flowing. Also, the soil is to dry for the sudden masses of rain and therefore it doesn't absorb as fast as it is needed plus it is too much rain at once for the soil at all to store. This results in floods and mud slidings if there is some inclination in the area. It will evaporate eventually when the rain stops and that may cause another problem then. Because the plants couldn't absorb the water (since there are no plants right now but I can't speak for the roots), so the water is gone again leaving a dry area. But it is highly possible that the plants will use the sudden water income (they are adapted to it) and will regrow and the seeds will sprout."

A prof of mine said they are as dangerous as a big cat (big cat-like in leopard for example, not a big breed home cat :D ). They can jump on you, and the claws, and some bird species, in general, like to aim for the eyes with their beaks (owls for example)."
