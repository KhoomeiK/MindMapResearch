1. the woman got third degree burns and required skin grafts

2. mcdonalds regulations required storing coffee at 190 degrees fahrenheit (for contrast, Starbucks coffee is served 40 degrees cooler, which is the difference between an ice cold bath and a jacuzzi that's too hot to use), but it is NOT supposed to be served at this temperature

3. 190 degree liquid causes third degree burns in 3-7 seconds.  

4. Third degree burns means your skin comes entirely off your body.  

5. a LOT of people had already been hurt by burning themselves on mcdonalds coffee.  

6. mcdonalds openly admitted that the temperature they store coffee at is ENTIRELY TOO HOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION

7. McDonalds did not warn their customers that they were storing coffee at an unusually high temperatures.

8. Twelve randomly selected american citizens sat on the jury, likely a mix of republicans and democrats, men and women, different ages, etc, and ALL 12 OF THEM felt like McDonalds was wrong, and all 12 of them agreed that the woman should be paid.

9. The woman did NOT put 3 million dollars in her pocket, a TON of that went to legal fees and medical bills.  This was not her lucky break to movin on up to the east side.

more than one person on the jury stated that McDonalds looked like idiots at the trial and the facts were ""so overwhelmingly against the company"""
