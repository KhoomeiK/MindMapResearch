You can talk about logical responses and proper training all you want, but in the heat of the moment mistakes and laspes in judgement get made from all sides. People panic. There's a margin of human error you're ignoring, and even if all the precautions have been made and that chance is astronomically small, it's still not zero. And any number higher than zero is far too high when school-aged kids are involved."

1: Tom Sato (ILB). He's goofy, geeky, and gorgeous. He wants to do the right thing and save people from the same fates that befell Redfield's victims, even though he's (quite reasonably) scared out of his mind by all this supernatural nonsense. A good guy through and through.

2: Skye Crandall (HSSCA) is the ultimate sweet goth gf. Honestly, everything about her character strikes a personal chord for me. From having less than mainstream interests (set design and punk rock, what a combination) to just wanting to stay true to herself no matter what to, unfortunately, her troubles with her family. I just want to give her a big ol hug at all times."
