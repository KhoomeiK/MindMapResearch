You aren't wrong that if you use a binary trigger that you will also likely spend more money on ammo. I know I have spent a lot that way! But the novelty experience and the fun that my friends' have shooting them makes it worth it to me. 

We have cheap 10/22s and expensive 10/22s on this sub. I guess I don't think price point is a valid concern here given that we all come from such different financial situations.

At my farm, I just have a truck bed or table set up and we aren't moving stations. (I only have 2 mechanical traps). At a course, it seems to require more coordination keeping up with everything. That said, I do plan on taking professional lessons even though I have about 20 years of bird hunting experience. 

> I just carry the gun around over my shoulder. If I have golf cart or walk cart I will put it there. 

I am concerned about my gun getting scratched up unnecessarily  over time when I ride. The golf cart has a holster for a soft bag so I've used that, but it's annoying to put it in and out every station. Maybe I just need to deal with it.

> I have a vest and a pouch...

When do you prefer each setup? Do you have a sporting clay specific backpack or just one you used for that purpose? Which one?  

> What is technical clothing? 

 Usually I see it describe performance-oriented clothing or specialized pieces. I usually wear normal clothes -- a heavy pair of chinos or cords (I hate jeans), button-up shirt, heavy workshirt or something over top if it is cold enough. Sometimes a ""shooting shirt"", but like Filson/Orvis style instead of anything modern. But I see many people wearing athletic type shirts and clothing as if they are going for performance. Especially so when I look at pro-level shooters.

> Not a bad idea, 

Yeah, I just meant for casual group outings rather than with serious shooters. I know anyone who cares will want their own kit and setup. Which is why I am trying to figure mine out. Haha."
ClayBusters,fdkovr0,t1_fdkn3i4,1578508078.0,The course Miata is a power move! This place could handle an ATV and one guy actually had a Mahindra parked outside. I didnít attempt the Lexus. Iíve used their golf carts so far because some of the stations are a good little walk at the place Iíve been. It costs $40ish in total for a round of 50 and their cart if using your own gun and ammo.
ClayBusters,fdkm8gm,t3_elw30l,1578506466.0,"Hey crew. I am a lifelong gun owner, but mostly a hunter. Always had a few mechanical traps around to get ready for birds, but never took it seriously. I am finally getting more into it and wondering how the pros do it. When Iím with a friend or two on the farm itís pretty easy, but going to professional courses requires a bit more coordination. How do you do it?

Iíve only been a few times so far. Carrying my gun in itís hard case in unfeasible. Iíve used a soft bag, but hated messing with it so much. Thinking a sock would be even worse. 

I carried a range bag which has extras ears and eyes, Leatherman MUT, basic cleaning kits, screwdriver set, Allen set, choke tool, headlight, gloves and first aid kit. Carried several boxes of ammo, but just in their original cardboard sleeve. I donít have a vest, pouch, shotshell carrier or anything yet. 

For ear pro, even the low profile electronic muffs get in the way of my shooting so I am just using foam. What do you recommend? Likewise, should I just go ahead and order Pillas or will I be happy with something lesser? Advice on things that will save time/money in the long run at the expense of cost now, I would appreciate. I hate using inferior products that I want to toss. 

I didnít wear any type of technical clothing although I see a lot of people doing that. Does it make a difference?

One thing that I have found to be easiest if shooting with a lot of people is just to buy a bunch of ammo yourself and let people Venmo you or whatever if you are worried about the cost. Saves a lot of time to have one set of ammo on the stand if you are with 3-4 people rather than everyone doing their own.

Edit: what is your favorite gun out there? I have been using my Beretta 682, but honestly Iíve enjoyed my lighter Browning A5s just as much. Just got a Beretta A300 Outlander and itís fine. Will be good in the woods I guess."

1022,fdnj7l5,t1_fdnfn0r,1578586937.0,BX is a garbage trigger. Not worth spending $5 in my opinion. Much less $50. Put that money toward something that‚Äôs actually an improvement.

Do you have a particular gun cart, vest and pouch that you like or that you'd get today if you were searching? What did you look for in those items?

Do you just leave your ammo in the case then too? I see so much advertising for pouches to dump it in. I understand why reloaders would want that, but statistics suggest that almost everyone shoots factory."
ClayBusters,fdkqflb,t1_fdknymq,1578509003.0,"Hey, thanks for the reply.

> Find a coach or videos or a buddy who can shoot well and learn from them. 

I should have been more clear. Not asking about how to shoot. Asking about how to manage all the necessary equipment. At my farm, I just have a truck bed or table set up and we aren't moving stations. (I only have 2 mechanical traps). At a course, it seems to require more coordination keeping up with everything. That said, I do plan on taking professional lessons even though I have about 20 years of bird hunting experience. 

> I just carry the gun around over my shoulder. If I have golf cart or walk cart I will put it there. 

I am concerned about my gun getting scratched up unnecessarily  over time when I ride. The golf cart has a holster for a soft bag so I've used that, but it's annoying to put it in and out every station. Maybe I just need to deal with it.

> I have a vest and a pouch...

When do you prefer each setup? Do you have a sporting clay specific backpack or just one you used for that purpose? Which one?  

> What is technical clothing? 

 Usually I see it describe performance-oriented clothing or specialized pieces. I usually wear normal clothes -- a heavy pair of chinos or cords (I hate jeans), button-up shirt, heavy workshirt or something over top if it is cold enough. Sometimes a ""shooting shirt"", but like Filson/Orvis style instead of anything modern. But I see many people wearing athletic type shirts and clothing as if they are going for performance. Especially so when I look at pro-level shooters.

> Not a bad idea, 

Yeah, I just meant for casual group outings rather than with serious shooters. I know anyone who cares will want their own kit and setup. Which is why I am trying to figure mine out. Haha."
ClayBusters,fdkovr0,t1_fdkn3i4,1578508078.0,The course Miata is a power move! This place could handle an ATV and one guy actually had a Mahindra parked outside. I didn‚Äôt attempt the Lexus. I‚Äôve used their golf carts so far because some of the stations are a good little walk at the place I‚Äôve been. It costs $40ish in total for a round of 50 and their cart if using your own gun and ammo.
ClayBusters,fdkm8gm,t3_elw30l,1578506466.0,"Hey crew. I am a lifelong gun owner, but mostly a hunter. Always had a few mechanical traps around to get ready for birds, but never took it seriously. I am finally getting more into it and wondering how the pros do it. When I‚Äôm with a friend or two on the farm it‚Äôs pretty easy, but going to professional courses requires a bit more coordination. How do you do it?

I‚Äôve only been a few times so far. Carrying my gun in it‚Äôs hard case in unfeasible. I‚Äôve used a soft bag, but hated messing with it so much. Thinking a sock would be even worse. 

I carried a range bag which has extras ears and eyes, Leatherman MUT, basic cleaning kits, screwdriver set, Allen set, choke tool, headlight, gloves and first aid kit. Carried several boxes of ammo, but just in their original cardboard sleeve. I don‚Äôt have a vest, pouch, shotshell carrier or anything yet. 

For ear pro, even the low profile electronic muffs get in the way of my shooting so I am just using foam. What do you recommend? Likewise, should I just go ahead and order Pillas or will I be happy with something lesser? Advice on things that will save time/money in the long run at the expense of cost now, I would appreciate. I hate using inferior products that I want to toss. 

I didn‚Äôt wear any type of technical clothing although I see a lot of people doing that. Does it make a difference?

One thing that I have found to be easiest if shooting with a lot of people is just to buy a bunch of ammo yourself and let people Venmo you or whatever if you are worried about the cost. Saves a lot of time to have one set of ammo on the stand if you are with 3-4 people rather than everyone doing their own.

Edit: what is your favorite gun out there? I have been using my Beretta 682, but honestly I‚Äôve enjoyed my lighter Browning A5s just as much. Just got a Beretta A300 Outlander and it‚Äôs fine. Will be good in the woods I guess."

Targeted drone strikes have been a major tool in the GWOT since it‚Äôs beginning (for better or for worse).

This is nothing like Iraq. There is no Colin Powell at the UN making a case for war. The warmonger was fired.  The president has asked Iran to negotiate. He even said it in a pretty nice way for trump, ‚ÄúIran has never lost a negotiation.‚Äù And it‚Äôs true, the US is generous in the concessions we are willing to make for minimal change. We gave Iran $150 billion in cash while they still were supporting terrorist activities against us just because they temporarily stopped doing something else we didn‚Äôt like.

raleigh,fd2lwm7,t1_fd2i5qx,1578149089.0,"Because under informed people who don‚Äôt actually follow world events can be easily whipped into a frenzy for political gain. Why not have an anti-Trump rally even though he‚Äôs actually shown restraint in this one area? 

I used work in electoral politics and sent out ‚Äúinflammatory‚Äù stuff all the time. Direct marketing means interest groups can easily target those who would be most impacted by the issue. Both parties use these systems. Each voter is ranked on important issues. Using this as an example, when I would see a story about the opposing party engaging in foreign intervention; I could quickly throw together a short email blast (for donations or activism) and select people in a certain area or district with ‚Äúanti-war‚Äù as one of their top 3 issues and send it out to them. Cuts down on excess spam to your donor list so less people ask to be removed. Especially useful for physical mailing campaigns because you save money on postage by only targeting people who are likely to care. 

Similarly, most protests aren‚Äôt organic. I would get a tip about a fundraiser or meeting and feed it to activists or a local group to organize their members to protest. Very often, interns make protest signs ahead that are distributed for the group to pass out since most people don‚Äôt really give that much of a shit. Haha."
