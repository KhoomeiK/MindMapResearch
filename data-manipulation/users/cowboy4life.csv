gallifrey,fg8a6ci,t1_fg89gof,1580613677.0,Which I realize would probably have some filler but it would also allow to expand on things rather than make cuts for time to fit 45 minutes because it’s broadcast TV
todayilearned,fg8a186,t1_fg89wim,1580613566.0,"Possibly, I just assumed because they didn’t mention that they were both inspiration for Wonder Woman."

gallifrey,fg6ipjo,t1_ffzcoug,1580569044.0,"Well they are Doctor’s who don’t recognize each other. Previously the Doctor has met himself but recognized him as well. They don’t recognize each other and they aren’t supposed to be meeting, unlike “The Three Doctor”, “The Five Doctor”,  “The Two Doctors”, “The Day if the Doctor”"
gallifrey,fg6hjqm,t1_fg0nicf,1580568151.0,Yeah like it starts out as a really good idea and sort of devolves and writing is trying to wrap up everything in time to meet the mark
gallifrey,fg6h940,t1_fg5uo5h,1580567916.0,That dude is a grade a loon. Plus he tried to straw man and use what if’s. Like he can’t conceive of the idea that we can not like companions because they are poorly written. Or that season 11 was sub par. What an apologist
gallifrey,fg6dxvo,t1_fg5nvs1,1580565091.0,What’s interesting is the monk was only called a time traveler. But they did refer to his ship as a TARDIS so he might be one. Last we left he was at the Normand Invasion. And I believe he was in an 8 Big Finish story.
gallifrey,fg6d0jp,t1_fg63ti8,1580564188.0,I like this. It allows for a fresh start from a stagnant three way tie. I think three companions works better when you have 4-6 episodes (or 80-120 minutes) per story. Right now I want them to just stop repeating 2007 RTD plot ideas
TrueOffMyChest,fg65xz9,t3_ex4fqz,1580555344.0,One of these parties is much much much worse for America. They are absolutely not equal. You just said one party is is subverting the will of the people and protecting a wannabe autocrat while the other modified their own rules to allow another debate candidate.
TrueOffMyChest,fg65tjr,t3_ex4gf1,1580555161.0,Just always try and arrest them the same.  Starting with doing lots of things together then slowly transition to thing separately so when the first dog passes you aren’t reminded of the first dog and stop doing things with the new one
AmItheAsshole,fg4dc1q,t1_fg4d3n8,1580501345.0,But him attempting to do good by doing an asshole move still makes him the asshole. In this scam rip Robbie didn’t do anything wrong so he is not the asshole here at all. Unless his question is between him and his friend then yes they both are assholes.

politics,fg0cr14,t1_fg0c4ov,1580405054.0,Exactly. I understand why federal justices have lifetime appointments originally but we are such a drastically different country than 230 years ago. The Trump stress test of our government and society potentially can lead to fixes but living through it has been an utter nightmare.
politics,fg0a4r3,t1_fg09bf8,1580403480.0,"You’re right it probably has colored my opinion but 71 is still a decent bit older than 65. Alito is a quite aged as well. 

The average term for SCOTUS justices is approximately 16 years so 28 years for Thomas is the 19th longest justice in court history. If he lasts 8.37 more years he would be the longest servicing justice and not even crack 80 years old."

politics,ffzzaqe,t1_ffzxcez,1580396658.0,"He could pack the court.
RBG could retire and there’s one, and Thomas is quite aged as well so two, and Breyer makes three. Breyer would probably retire as well. I don’t know what it would take to get rid of Thomas outside of death or impeachment. He’s such a partisan hack he might try and stay out of spite to serve his corporate overlords."

AskReddit,ffygkn6,t1_ffeefru,1580345917.0,"You are absolutely being greedy. I’m glad you have some self awareness of that fact, but you choosing to be greedy when you know you’re being greedy is morally reprehensible. Thinking that Trump would be beneficial to you and Bernie would be bad is flawed logic because all of Trump’s policies are for the benefit of himself and his “friends” only. 

Just because your taxes went down a few bucks the last couple years seems to have blinded you to the fact that the current budget is about to run a TRILLION dollar deficit. You would choose someone who lowers corporate taxes at the expense of the credit rating of the country. Someone who waged a useless trade war and severely fucked over farmers in this country and cost Americans Over 46 BILLION in tariffs.

Voting for Trump because he gave you a few bucks is like saying well it was cold today so obviously climate change is blown out of proportion or doesn’t exist at all."

politics,ffatey6,t1_ffaqytd,1579744068.0,"A pipeline brings risk of spilling. Now where the pipeline is will determine where the oil spill so it could spill onto land, or into bodies of water. And wherever this oil spills it will deep into the water table and create non-potable water that people rely on. There are already more than enough pipelines spanning the United States and adding this new one puts more people in danger.

The 1990’s and 2000’s are littered with stories of companies who did that very same thing. The pensions end up bankrupted, and all the employees have no safety net. Just because you put the money “in an index” doesn’t guarantee a return. And remember the moment of the next stock market crash, everyone loses their social security."

changemyview,fexzfeh,t3_eqvlcy,1579438751.0,"That idea is beyond ludicrous. The risk of putting people’s social security money in the stock market is terrifying. The real solution is to remove the limit on the Social Security Tax on incomes of $137,700 or more. Also closing tax loopholes and a reduction in useless military spending."
