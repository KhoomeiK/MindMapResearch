What breed is your dog? Unless he is a chihuahua, or a collie or an akita or something like that (very loyal, one person breeds), he will bond with you too. It sounds like he already has if he's giving you kisses and coming up to you to say hi. Even if you aren't the ""favorite"", he still loves you. He will be sad when you leave and excited when you come home. After I was gone for a week, my mom's dog spent the next day following me around the house wagging his tail."
SweatyPalms,ffe4z3o,t1_ffdzcet,1579836835.0,"Actually they believe the underlying reasons to be cultural as well. In India people with schizophrenia tended to believe the voices were dead relatives talking to them. There was also less of a stigma against hearing voices. They believe that the reason the voices tend to be scary in Western countries, is because the person associates it with something being wrong with them. 
   
I read an article a while ago about a woman whose son was diagnosed with schizophrenia and his symptoms improved dramatically when she connected him with a shaman from somewhere in west Africa. He was still hearing voices, but because he was talking with someone who viewed his illness as a special gift rather than a terrible sickness, he was able to cope better."

Not sure where you live, but volunteering at a local shelter for women who have been rescued can make a huge difference, and especially with your background, I bet they would love to have you!"

AnimalsBeingDerps,feyqdvs,t1_feyglql,1579449274.0,"To be fair, there is such a thing, it's just that ""mini pigs"" are only mini...compared to the 1,000 Ibs tank that is a normal pig. A ""mini pig"" will only grow to be the size of your couch instead of to the size of your car.
   
But for some reason people expect a ""small pig"" to stay the size of a chihuahua. That's like buying a ""small whale"" and expecting it to fit in your bathtub. 
   
(And that's not even getting into *how* they got the pig to stay so small. Malnourishment, premature C-section births, and other unpleasant things are often done to get a ""smaller"" pig.)"

dankchristianmemes,fela8fy,t1_fekm9nj,1579217466.0,"So, as far as Jesus goes, there are multiple accounts of him written by Jewish and Roman historians. 
To name a few: 
   
Flavius Josephus mentions Jesus in *Jewish Antiquities* (a 20-volume history of the Jews, written around 93 A.D.)
   
Cornelius Tacitus mentions Jesus in the *Annals of Imperial Rome*, (a history of the Roman Empire written around 116 A.D.)
    
While these only briefly mention Jesus, we also have the documents used in the Bible which are far, *far* more well preserved than anything else we have from that time. 
   
Hope that helps :)"

AnimalsBeingDerps,feb15ga,t1_fe9k4j7,1578954412.0,My pup is the opposite. He will only drink from his older brothers water dish. His brother has some seriously stinky breath. Maybe it adds flavor?
aww,feb04ij,t1_feaostx,1578954082.0,"The dog park near me costs money and is manned by a persnickety older lady on a power trip (She once yelled at me for letting my dog pee on the grass outside the park). But the longer I go there, the more I appreciate it because it keeps people with badly behaved dogs away.

HistoryPorn,fe594gz,t1_fe50lzp,1578866712.0,"If you are interested in the Japanese civilian war experience, I highly recommend the book, *Japan at War: an Oral History*. It's a collection of stories from Japanese civilians from all walks of life. The people were very much pressured into contributing to the war effort and were told it was for the ""Greater Good"". It's a heavy read, but I highly recommend it.
   
A shorter, but very sad book is, *In the Realm of A Dying Emperor* by Norma Field, which documents the experiences of some townspeople in Okinawa during the war. Fair warning though: I did not make it through this book without crying."

AskHistorians,fdkx6su,t3_elsxxn,1578513005.0,"So, disclaimer, I'm not a historian or expert, and my response only pertains to the Iranian Coup and is based on some digging I did through Proquest's newspaper archives.
   
An article from *The Atlanta Constitution* mentions that Anglo-Iranian oil stocks went up as a result of the coup, but the article cites a fear of communism in Iran as the reason behind the coup. I did not find anything from that time explicitly stating that there was heavy input from the Anglo-Iranian Oil company. But the benefits of the coup-de'Ã©tat to the Oil company were clear from the article, and to anyone following the stock market at the time."

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fdh43my,t1_fdgaxav,1578414954.0,"I did this with my elderly pup and then eventually gated off a corner of my room for him. He's going blind and deaf and losing his sense of smell so if left to wander the house, he will get stuck in a corner somewhere and cry because he's lost and doesn't know where he is. I still take him outside to sniff around and go on ""adventures"" (and poop), but he's old and prefers sleeping in a cozy spot over most other things. 
    
But again, he's elderly and small so maybe that's different?"

MemeEconomy,fct3f9d,t1_fcsmkzj,1577931863.0,"I mean, it depends on how you look at it. Northern Nigeria still has some desperately poor areas (which make up about 33% of the population).
