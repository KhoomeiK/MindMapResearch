motorcycles,femsxsn,t1_femrccw,1579268703.0,"He was quite some distance from me. However, he never intended to stop. I don't know where he was going because there were people in front of me. Had he hit me it would have been some real damage. Still not as scary as the government buses or tankers who don't mind crushing people at all. The biggest traffic rules violators are government vehicles or private vehicles owned by government officials."
motorcycles,femgszs,t1_fejxkf3,1579254768.0,"Traffic in India is weird. It is a horror show. There are no rules at all. I have seen people travelling in the wrong direction on highways. I have seen people making u-turns in peak traffic to go in the wrong direction.

It is so weird that I have had to run red lights because I spotted, in my rear-view mirrors, guys behind me who had no intention of stopping. Just look at this video and see how dangerous it is to follow rules in India:

Ubuntu,fejpfje,t3_epeegx,1579182432.0,"Sometime back in 2011, when I was totally a newbie, I installed Ubuntu on an external hard drive and booted. The file manager just blew my mind. Huge folders in another hard drive opened instantly whereas Windows would take 10 or more seconds to refresh the view. Nothing seems to have changed even today. Windows carries a lot of ""backward compatibility"" baggage etcetera. With GNU Linux, I am glad that I don't have to share the burden."
motorcycles,fejgufx,t3_ephssn,1579173616.0,I am not arguing who is right here. This was totally avoidable for the motorcyclist. The visibility was good. There was enough time to assess the situation. One should anticipate stupid moves by other drivers/riders. Be afraid. Always.
motorcycles,fejgq3y,t3_epealn,1579173451.0,"Not an overkill at all.

If I try to do this in India, the young morons would lose their minds and start racing like there is no tomorrow. The funny thing is most guys in India ride without helmets and are almost always in slippers. For them, someone wearing a good helmet is an invitation for a race."
news,fdtva4k,t1_fdtu5zn,1578722768.0,"I have worked for corporations that employ twice the number of people Boeing employs.

You have not understood the scale of the MAX problem. It is not as if some puny employee stole a couple of hard drives with data on them and the company lost a few millions as a consequence. The MAX problem is too big of an issue to remain hidden from the CEO. I bet every C-Suite employee was aware and wished the general public would never notice.

If all success belongs to CEO, failures of *this scale* should too. That is a big concession."
news,fdtst8f,t1_fdtrilh,1578721645.0,"If what you say is true and a puny employee made the decision of ""cutting costs at the expense of safety"", the CEO and a bunch of others should be fired and held legally responsible for the mess. Processes were not followed. There was no oversight. Shows a complete systemic failure.

It is impossible for a puny employee in such bureaucratic corporations to take such big decisions. ""Need to know"" and ""principle of least privilege"" are the norm at large corporations.

Also, if what you say is correct there is no way a CEO would be sacrificed over a puny employee. That never happens."
news,fdtp02s,t1_fdtmg99,1578719984.0,A lot was sacrificed to cut costs - a lot of very important checks and balances. A puny employee cannot make such decisions. Such decisions come from the top.

However, I can consistently do triple digit speeds (kmph) on my Honda CBR250R and Yamaha R15. They are excellent for commute.

I too want a bigger bike, but would not want to go beyond a 650cc."

That makes me humble. It really does.

Cars have four wheels. A great advantage. Also, it shields you from elements. I don't care anyhow."
openSUSE,fc8mkop,t3_egq1vn,1577538006.0,"I have used a lot of distros, but I came back to openSUSE. I use Leap when stability is required and Tumbleweed when I feel like being on bleeding edge. Right now my laptop is getting Leap installed in it. It was running Tumbleweed, but I decided to make it the permanent brain running my dumb TV (not smart TV). Tumbleweed on such a machine is overkill.

openSUSE just feels more polished - the color scheme, the mascot and many other small things. I am biased because it was my first love in the Linux world.

Fedora and Arch are also top quality. I stopped using Arch when I got busy. Also, Debian Sid was quite stable when I used it."

dogs,fc24ii3,t3_efon9j,1577340095.0,"Cooking steak is ok. Seasoning is not. Never feed cooked bones. The fundamental structure of the bone is altered when cooked. Cooked bones splinter when bitten into and can cause severe injury or death.

In my experience, feeding raw meat is the best. However, I can always get fresh meat. Depending on how you source it, cooking may be necessary or not."
