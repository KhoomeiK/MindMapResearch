movies,ff4sc0h,t1_ff4msuu,1579571263.0,"I was taking your use of ""literally"" as being on for emphasis, which seemed to be your intention, but fine, I can address your revised comment.

No single person can force you to believe anything, but the entire entertainment industry united under a single cause sure can. Advertising works. A concerted effort by a large enough section of the media can give you opinions you didn't have before, and most people don't have the fortitude or time to pursue multiple sections of the media to compare.

Hollywood as an industry has a political culture, and what they say gives enormous emphasis to the causes that they choose to support. It's unavoidable.

The problem is that the kind of causes Hollywood tends to properly speak out on are not the kind that De Niro or yourself have mentioned; they instead focus on racism, feminism, transgender rights, homophobia, all those things. They're noble and important causes but simultaneously they are definitely causes that hold little relevance to people who are struggling to make ends meet. This happens simply because of the economic demographics of the most influential people in that industry, they're the issues holding them back.

If Hollywood really did do something as simple as throw their weight behind universal healthcare, then I'd be saying something very different right now. Perhaps De Niro is a different kind of actor, but the industry he's part of hasn't reflected those intentions."

I did neither of those things this election but I have enough empathy to know that this subreddit wasn't a healthy place to even be in for a few months. It drove people to have a completely warped perspective on what was going on in politics and in the public and stopped being informative.
