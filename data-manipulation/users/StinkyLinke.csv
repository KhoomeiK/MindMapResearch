interestingasfuck,fcwus2j,t1_fcwhv0a,1578038476.0,Thereâ€™s an accompanying one of a firey who not only will not shake his hand (who scomo also forces a handshake on) but who also doesnâ€™t even get out of his chair for him. ðŸ˜†

interestingasfuck,fcwhkaq,t1_fcwh8j6,1578025802.0,Scott Morrison is getting absolutely roasted (no pun intended) over his handling of the whole affair but I fear that our next election is too far away and by the time it rolls around this will be forgotten (or more likely another leadership spill) and they will just hang the spectre of a spoooky tax increase if you vote for the other party....boo! Itâ€™s gotten them elected for decades.

interestingasfuck,fcwh1r1,t1_fcu6pe8,1578025421.0,Never said it wasnâ€™t. Australia is still on fire right now and stuff like this probably resurfaces in similar times because itâ€™s relevant to whatâ€™s going on.

interestingasfuck,fctyypc,t1_fctxa6t,1577966441.0,"The truck in front of them reversed back out of the path of the fire, and hit the stationary truck behind them. The truck you are watching from did not â€˜ramâ€™ the other truck. The video is demonstrating how fast the fire moves, from being away from the road to engulfing the road in seconds. These were fire trucks, rural fire service probably. So much of Australia is on fire at the moment that one of our states has declared a state of emergency. This has been going for months, we have many dead and missing and thousands of homes destroyed. We are only just beginning our summer now and most of the people fighting these fires are volunteers. It is a terrifying situation down here right now."

maybemaybemaybe,fctyj1p,t3_eix3la,1577965880.0,What is it? Is that a mole?
youseeingthisshit,fctydnc,t3_eix6i0,1577965685.0,I think they meant egg *sized* penis. About 1.5 inches tall and pointy at one end.

facepalm,fcdd67x,t1_fcb1lgi,1577608944.0,"Also, nice job invalidating the feelings of a 16 year old kid who felt violated by a guy older than her dad trying to pick her up and touch her. I guess you get to decide who should feel the most upset. Also I never said he stopped. He did not stop. He hung around the shop for about 2 hours and kept coming back periodically."
facepalm,fcdb8zi,t1_fcb1lgi,1577608405.0,"I never said shake hands. And do you normally shake hands with girls you are trying to hit on? And do you normally try to hit on servers who are just trying to do their job? Still inappropriate. Lastly, you are defending someone based on YOUR assumption that he thought the girl was of age. Even if she were 20 or 25 she would be young enough to be his daughter which isnâ€™t something you would assume a potential partner would be into. And FYI, another reason you can just take my fucking word for it - he had done it to other shop staff as well. Magically ONLY the young teenaged girls. And not just in my shop too. Mine was not the only shop he was banned from in the complex. This is the wrong situation to play devils advocate for."
facepalm,fcb9v2a,t1_fcb1lgi,1577584250.0,"We found the OPâ€™s manager, obviously.

Dude stop trying to make excuses about a situation you know nothing about. The creep is in his 50â€™s and you can just take my word for it that the girl looked 16, if not younger since I know her and you donâ€™t. And no, you cannot reach across the counter and hold a strangers hand like youâ€™re on a fucking date for no reason. Thatâ€™s gross and inappropriate. Maybe if youâ€™re leaving a kid shaken and in tears because youâ€™re so goddam predatory youâ€™re in the wrong no matter what the context. And my workplace manual says you canâ€™t grab my staff anywhere on their bodies without their permission if it makes them uncomfortable."
facepalm,fcaq99y,t1_fcaa6c7,1577574435.0,"That is gross, Iâ€™m sorry that happened to you. Both the touching and the response."
facepalm,fcapwpo,t1_fc9ex19,1577574227.0,A regular customer of mine (old alcoholic guy) once tried to give his phone number to my 16 year old shop girl and touch her hand. I fucking banned him for life from any of my stores. Anytime he would show up that I wasnâ€™t there the staff were free to tell him to piss off as much as they wanted.
