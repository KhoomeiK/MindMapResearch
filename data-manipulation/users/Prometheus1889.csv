news,ffg079v,t1_fff0yvz,1579895628.0,Why? Because I want doctors to stop prescribing opioids? That's the easiest solution to this problem. Let people grow up and handle their pain. Don't ask for strong pain medicine and then blame everyone else for your own failure to use it responsibly.
news,ffg03rs,t1_fff0c9s,1579895568.0,"I'm very anti-opioid. I think people should learn to deal with their pain instead of begging for strong pain medicine and then whining when they lack the self control to use it properly.  Grow up, you're an adult. Be responsible for your own behavior and choices."

news,ffdvzdh,t3_et0f4t,1579830294.0,"This article focuses on the wrong issues. The true racketeering charge is the kickbacks in the form of sham educational talks. Everything else is stupid - the addictive nature of the product (why not sue Heineken for making beer?), hiring attractive females as sales reps (common practice in multiple industries including tech), lap dance (that individual rep should be charged). In any case, get ready for a world without opiates. We have to learn to take personal responsibility for our actions, and that includes accepting pain as a fact of life. Don't gripe next time your doctor sends you home with tylenol.
