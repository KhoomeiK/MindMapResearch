bipolar,ffawqc1,t1_ffaoq5f,1579746265.0,Cool! The first time I did oil painting I didn’t realise how Long it would take to dry and I used way too much paint! Haahaa
bipolar,ffanwjm,t3_ese2ye,1579740371.0,Is this acrylic paint?
PublicFreakout,ff93wb4,t3_es7v6m,1579704225.0,"Cheating on me?
No. This kind man is helping me to go on the toilet lol"
PublicFreakout,ff92yep,t3_escknb,1579703558.0,Lol great work ethics
PublicFreakout,ff7hsap,t1_ff6096g,1579649860.0,Yeah why don’t people just ignore her and walk away? What’s the point of arguing with someone who is clearly mentally unstable?
bipolar,feoqdax,t3_eq1xx2,1579303913.0,Drawing anything.
bipolar,feopxm2,t3_eq4xrm,1579303753.0,"Yours seem like a heavy dose so you’ll definitely feel
Something"
bipolar,feopnbm,t3_eq6jyv,1579303611.0,I asked for lithium after being put on a couple of drugs and it’s the best decision. It stabilised my moods and I slowly got myself off it after a few months. But that was after a couple of episodes.
bipolar,feopesv,t3_eq7p7r,1579303472.0,Well maybe the tip could be that it’s okay to feel sad and depressed. And it will get better if you can just get through the day.
bipolar,feooypf,t1_feon2yq,1579303326.0,Such sweet words. I agree so much with this. I had to completely change my chaotic lifestyle and really take care of myself after I was diagnosed.
labrador,feoo2tb,t3_epupta,1579302830.0,Haha bed hog extraordinaire!! So is my lab
labradors,feolaj9,t3_eq5wsb,1579301745.0,Good luck and she is so cute :)
bipolar,fejv0l5,t1_fe7aqw5,1579186483.0,Do you have anyone who can monitor you at home and your emotions before they get out of hand? I think it’s a good idea to block your credit cards too if you always want to spend $$$ when manic.
bipolar,fejurs1,t3_epco6s,1579186322.0,Nice!
bipolar,fe79xzv,t1_fe72ts3,1578911932.0,I know it’s the last thing you wanna do but I hope you can go to your psych when you find these things happening. Hopefully they can stop it? Though I’ve never been able to identify it until I’m crashed out after a few days without sleep and in the hospital by then
puppy101,fe6d9xy,t1_fdstcvh,1578887544.0,Yup I knew this couple who confined their border collie to a tiny area in their room. These people do not deserve any dogs.
bipolar,fe6bmdm,t3_enycjx,1578886296.0,"These were my symptoms 

- insomnia / feeling very energetic even without sleep 
- posting weird things on social media 
- wanting to take pictures of everything 
- wanting to book a trip immediately
- wanting to buy lots of new clothes / things 
- not wanting to eat"
bipolar,fe68day,t3_ennqt6,1578884025.0,I bought a SAD lamp off amazon! Really liking it. You can bring it whichever room you’re at too
bipolar,fe67bc0,t3_ebz6jt,1578883406.0,I didn’t like those either. I was injected with Olanzopine (when I was unconscious). Lithium worked for me after that. Have you tried Lithium?
bipolar,fe667bf,t1_fe2f23c,1578882692.0,"When it happened to me, after prolonged insomnia and stressful days, apparently I was talking to myself a lot and had to be sent to the hospital where I was injected with an anti-psychotic. I could hear what was happening but could not respond coherently. Felt like I was having a bad dream that I could not wake up from. Because of the sounds and talking, I knew that I was in a hospital or clinic. Then I was brought home and woke up in bed not knowing what had happened. Freaked the f out of me."
labrador,fe4qile,t3_enoue8,1578861896.0,Pretty version of lab :) i have a black one
Dogtraining,fdsj74w,t1_fdrzmk1,1578703783.0,My puppy did this to me too! When she realised that I would get out of bed to cuddle with her when she whines at 4am. I am simply too tired to go back to the room to sleep so I just crash on a beanbag next to her pen lol but we started to ignore her and now she whines only when it is breakfast time
puppy101,fdshpxa,t1_fdrgicm,1578702963.0,Agreed! So many people get border collies not knowing what they’re getting into...
Dogtraining,fdshakx,t1_fds3x30,1578702733.0,This! My pup injured her front leg while jumping up onto a platform that was too high for her. So make sure the surrounding is safe without steps or platforms she may want to jump up or down without knowing her limits
bipolar,fdhc5z0,t3_elbd00,1578419758.0,Lost connections is a great book to read :)
