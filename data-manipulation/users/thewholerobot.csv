Most descriptions of this stuff boil down to analogies like, let's say in the classic physics world you have to exert F amount of force to lift this rock up a hill. Ok are you picturing that?  Got it?  Good.  Ok, so now imagine you are on the quantum scale and the rock is not a rock but instead it's a donkey and you are a serpent and you are both on top of the hill and at the bottom of the hill, but the you at the bottom of the hill has green eyes instead of blue and the donkey has two tails.  Also you are inside the hill, but nobody can ever know you are there.  

Somewhere in between those two explanations I always get a little lost.  Allegedly if you can understand the mathematics behind the phenomenons this all somehow ""clicks"" but trying to rectify this with experiential reality doesn't even get me close personally."

Never hold anything for anyone, never ever arrange your schedule around anyone, offer delivery only for what your time is really worth (I charge more than the item cost for delivery some time).  My response is, the item will be available for your viewing from x-yoclock tomorrow, text me just before you leave (gives you a chance to stop them if someone else claims it).  Never expect a sale to go through if you make arrangements for more than 24h out from receiving a response.  If your item isn't moving you've over estimated its real world value. Drop it by 20percent and prepare to goodwill it if it doesn't move in 2weeks.
