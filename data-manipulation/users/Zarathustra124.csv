Napoleon stands nearby to watch Tyson's back and stop the flag being taken while he's busy. Napoleon's sacrificial, though, he doesn't matter compared to the other two. Bolt acts as cavalry, either flanking and harassing the attackers with hit-and-run attacks, or threatening their flag and forcing them to split their resources between attack and defence. The other two can help break any remaining defenders once most of their force has been defeated by Tyson.

Round three limits Bolt's usefulness, but allows them to use heavy tree limbs as clubs more effectively than the children can. Should be basically the same as round 1, just keep Bolt closer.

Knives make it tougher, sheer numbers probably overwhelm them as long as the kids are smart enough to rush them together. Definitely send Bolt after their flag, playing more aggressively and attempting a quick steal, to force the kids to focus more on defence and limit their power to rush the others.

Robocraft,fewbuve,t3_eqrdwe,1579408103.0,"1: Use all 2000 CPU. There's no longer any bonus for staying small, keep adding basic blocks to maximize health.

2: A t5 rail and an energy module is the best all-around armament, as long as you're not a flyer. Stop and let the crosshairs meet in the middle for maximum accuracy, firing while moving only works at close range. t5 laser is also a fine choice. The others are situational or require more specialized builds to use effectively. Energy module is excellent no matter what weapon you use, every bot should have one.

3: You only need one t5 gun, don't waste CPU on spares when you could have more armor instead. Heals are an excellent addition if you have some spare CPU, especially in no-respawn elimination.

4: Make your bot solid and chunky. Don't let enemies disconnect parts from the main body, it's free bonus damage and rails are great at targeting weak points. I often see long thin bots get cut in half by a well-placed rail or two. Fortify the connection points of weapon and movement parts as much as possible, and use the compact blocks to attach them, or embed struts deep inside your bot and attach the parts to those. For t5 guns with multiple connection points, use all of them and try to keep those body areas separate so a single shot can't disconnect all three.

5: Mech legs or sprinter legs are a nice foolproof movement option for beginners. Insect legs are more tricky to build with and use correctly, though I personally like them for flyer hybrids. Treads are strong but slow, add forward thrusters to speed it up. Wheels are garbage. Skis are only for niche use cases. Don't use hover blades or flying parts with rails, you can't stabilize to aim unless you land. t5 hovers are weak, if you want a hovercraft use a bunch of t4s instead."
