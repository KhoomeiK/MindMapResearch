wma,ffi38e3,t3_etr92i,1579963785.0,"1. What weapon are you studying or what weapon interests you? That affects what recommendations people will give you, and should be the single most important factor in picking a source/system.

2. By and large, no -- you won't find a style ""centered around"" counter-attacks, any more that you'll find a style centered around anything else. I'd posit that it's really not useful (and sometimes counter-productive) to look at weapon systems this way. It sounds a little like a ""my-tiger-style-will-defeat-your-monkey-style"" type of characterization, or an example of ""video-game-thinking"" in which you're allocating points to attack/defense/counter or whatever. I don't mean any of this particularly harshly -- it's more of a friendly cautionary note about mindset.

3. If you're interested in longsword, early Liechtenauer KdF makes use of single-time counters, as well as concepts like nachreisen which are either preemptive counters before an opponent attacks, or a reactive counter to void a strike and then attack. All that said, the primary focus of KdF is first and foremost to get your weapon inside the other guy quickly, simply, and effectively.

4. Pretty much **all** systems will include the types of concepts I've discussed in #3... so per #1 and #2.... just pick a weapon you like, and have fun learning about that weapon, rather than forcing a weapon into a preconceived notion of style.

Good luck, and welcome!"

If you want to study Meyer longsword, this is a nice book to have.

To put things in somewhat simplified context, Meyer was a fencing master who sought to ""revive"" longsword fencing in a time in which the longsword was somewhat obsolete as a battlefield/everyday weapon. Meyer is a continuation, (and interpretation) of Early Liechtenauer longsword, which is the essentially the cornerstone of Germanic longsword practice.

Meyer followed Liechtenauer by a couple hundred years, so if your intention is to study early Liechtenauer, this book wouldn't be immediately applicable.

IF (big if) you only ever will have one message available, I'd do it this way:

I would make my global message a `struct message*` set to NULL, and in the game loop, I check to see if it's null, otherwise, if it points to a valid struct message, I print the message, and decrement it's ""ticks_remaining"" count.

If the ""ticks_remaining"" count reaches 0, I run a ""free_message()"" function that frees the malloc'd string and the malloc'd struct message, then I set the global message pointer to null.

When I want to display a new message, if one already exists, I free_message() it (this is the edgecase of triggering a new message while a message already exists), then I use an init_message() function to malloc the struct message, and malloc the message string.

In other words, yes -- in this case, I'm fine with dynamically allocating strings, but I put the ownership to clean up the string in the same function that cleans up the message itself...

I guess what I'm getting at, overall, is that you seem to be locking yourself into a particular scenario in which you must save a populated format-string across multiple frames of your game loop. Without understanding the rest of your code, I'm not sure why this is necessary.

Personally, I wouldn't have necessarily architected it that way. Why not format the string at runtime when you print it, but not save the full string otherwise? Why you *need* a specific message string to persist across multiple frames? Shouldn't changes to the underlying data be enough to trigger an update?

**Edit** ah -- I understand now -- you're (re)drawing the message every frame until the duration has elapsed, so you want to save it until you no longer need to draw it... Correct?  Hmmm... thinking for a moment. Will edit shortly."

C_Programming,ff4l8bx,t1_ff46b8b,1579566322.0,"Alright -- here's the deal. You've got some type issues.

The thing to remember is that arrays degrade to pointers when they're passed to functions.  `ageadd` takes a `float*` (ie a float pointer), so you can simply pass `age` as an argument, and not have to worry about passing `&age[0]`.

Secondly, (and more importantly) when you declare the function, you are using the function signature

    void ageadd(float *age)

But when you define the function, you're using the function signature

    void ageadd(float *age[])

In other words, in the declaration, you're saying it takes a float pointer ie a `float*`, but in the definition, you're saying that it takes a float *array* pointer instead -- ie a `float**`.

Go ahead and work through that. Finally, whenever you post a question about code that doesn't work, you owe us 4 things:

1. The code (properly formatted)

2. The *expected* output or result

3. The *actual* result that differs from the expected result or the *entire error message if the code fails to compile* or the *entire runtime error*.

4. The platform, the compiler, and any options/arguments that you're using to compile.

This information helps you get a better answer more quickly, as it can help us diagnose the problem with minimal effort.

I'm willing to bet that you've got a compiler error, yes?

Finally, for the sake of clarity, you should be very wary about how you name your variables. You've got a variable called `age` that's scoped to main, but then you've also got a variable `age` that's scoped to `ageadd`. While this is probably okay (technically) in this example, it can lead to confusion when you're dealing with longer code. Anything that makes the code easier to follow/read is probably a good change."

I've once had to implement a ""no pommel-throwing meme"" rule in class, simply because I couldn't mention the word ""pommel"" without someone smirking and making a pommel joke, and derailing the class for a bit. It fucked up my concentration.

Don't get me wrong -- there's a time and a place for it, and Reddit most certainly is the place... But when the low-effort meme becomes a circle-jerk (not saying that this is a circle-jerk or low-quality) -- it becomes annoying."
