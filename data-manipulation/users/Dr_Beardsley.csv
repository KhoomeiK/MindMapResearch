That's why it's important to not notify current employers until you get the final offer."

AskReddit,fepvctj,t3_eqacbx,1579332633.0,"When people say mental illness is fake, or assume they know all about your illness.
When people say mental illness is not that bad.

When you are in such pain you can't leave the bed, so tired and empty all you can do is silently cry, the pain and ache in your bones and muscles, just wanting to die so it will be over... you can't even call into work for that. But Janice can call in because she has a tummy ache. While some people believe mental illness is real, they can't believe it is 'that bad'."

bipolar,fe6qiqh,t3_enyftw,1578900681.0,"It took me almost 6 years, but I was damn stubborn and got my diploma in 2018. It is possible! Some advice I learned the hard way:

1. Take advantage of the student disability services. All of it. Don't hesitate to ask for help.

2. Don't overwhelm yourself!! Plan your semesters realistically, reducing credit hours if need be.

3. Make friends with your professors. It helps so very dearly to have an ally when you aren't at 100%.

4. Remember every day why you are doing this, and know that you are a warrior with a vastly impressive record. You have survived the demon hordes that plague your mind every day. Organic Chemistry and Calculus will not be the end of you.


You are going to nail this!!!"
