oculus,ffqgw91,t3_eugd4p,1580134243.0,"BoxVR is great. And a step above in intensity is Thrill of the Fight. I think it’s currently on sale.

Make sure to towel off periodically and clean the headset is sensible ways. Also don’t use wet cleaners on the lenses. Good job."
oculus,ffqgmoy,t3_euo1nn,1580134023.0,"Finished **Obduction**. It’s alright- about what I expected. Good world building. Good graphics too. 

Trying to figure out what game to play in my backlog or if to try and buy a new game from the Lunar New Year sale—- eff it, going straight for **Asgard’s Wrath** in my backlog. I hope I am not disappointed. My expectations are high. So far so good."
nba,ffpvug7,t1_ffov6qv,1580107690.0,Kobe patterned his game after Mike’s. Mike has said he patterned his game off of George Gervin and Dr J.
SteamVR,ffpvmg6,t3_euhsbo,1580107433.0,"Your game list is too long and couldn’t filter by VR. Dunno. 

The Talos Principle VR ($5.99? sale price?) was amazing and not many talk about it."
buildapcsales,ffpveyr,t3_euh40c,1580107197.0,I spent almost this much for six cores. Fucking Intel.
entertainment,ffpurbb,t1_ffpe80u,1580106472.0,"I never said any of that.

Edit I have 3 or so policies that I need to see from a candidate for me to support- here in current American left right spectrum in 2020. Universal Healthcare which isn’t radical, take Global Warming seriously, drug reform, and maybe student debt reform. *And whatever it takes to make it happen.* All the wedge issues- IDC. If MSNBC supports those reasonable issues then great, they are progressive. If not then they are not left- just a corporate stooge talking a big game for ratings."
virtualreality,ffpulrw,t3_eu4nwp,1580106309.0,"Some manufacturer will have to make a run of “husky” sized headsets.

But seriously- find an IPD app and see if it gives you different numbers."
virtualreality,ffpuf61,t3_eu9llm,1580106113.0,"Speaking of potential uses besides gaming, imagine operating a crane with god mode type overhead vision. No more blindspots. Or (I’m sure they are already working on this) doing microsurgery on tiny blood vessels with a small robot that works as the surgeon’s hands and eyes- with appropriate depth perception and all of that.

I like when someone recently said, “VR is dead but it is all out of stock.”"
virtualreality,ffpu5tj,t3_euffs3,1580105829.0,I’d go current gen Ryzen. It will mean less time between next upgrades.
virtualreality,ffpaw26,t1_ffi7fjg,1580090490.0,That was it for me- that whiney out of place voice over. He was absolutely horrible.
virtualreality,ffpardt,t3_eucgro,1580090397.0,"If Index is in the mix, wait the few months. If money is an issue get the S."
nba,ffov85m,t3_eu85ba,1580082202.0,I think Bud rests players more because he is demanding an intense style of defending.
oculus,ffotseb,t1_ffjht6k,1580081718.0,Lighthouse is inside out. The sensors are on the controllers and headsets- the lighthouses are “dumb” devices laying out a grid of coordinates. They just plug into an outlet.
nba,ffoiptu,t1_ffohpap,1580078046.0,I remember reading about how he went to games and practices from Malibu to Staples in a helicopter. I thought- “What a baller. He travels like a CEO.” then also thought he must have a well maintained helicopter. Those things need constant maintenance. RIP.
entertainment,ffohihi,t1_ffn8s1t,1580077665.0,America is an oligarchy. It’s ran by rich folks and corporations. We all know it. If someone comes along and tries to stop the gravy train- what is going to happen?
entertainment,ffogvyl,t1_fflk9bo,1580077512.0,He is proposing things that will be radical change here (for the better) compared to the norm. Our country is run by corporations- he is a massive danger to their bottom line. Think about that. I often fear for him and other progressives if they ever got real power- like the presidency.
entertainment,ffogaw9,t1_ffmw0ut,1580077315.0,Do you really think the corporations that run that channel want LESS money? No corporation wants Bernie. Period.
oculus,ffofjwv,t1_ffnrga9,1580077173.0,Did you try the PTC public test channel in the beta tabs in the Oculus software? I’m just trying to think of anything. Good luck.
oculus,ffk1pgm,t3_ety0o3,1580013114.0,"I had (have) a cat that would always try to one up itself to get my attention. Biting wires, knocking stuff over. 

Played VR once and was ignoring him and then a big headset yank followed by a loud crash occurred. He kicked my PC off of my shelf. Little rascal. 

VR time = door shut time, now."
oculus,ffk1j32,t3_etv797,1580012960.0,"Go buy an S- try it out- if it works, it works- if not, then return it. Your eyes are what they are."
oculus,ffk12bt,t3_eu0cdh,1580012557.0,You checking temps? What games? All games? Just a few? Check your super sample settings. Update your drivers. Is it a prebuilt? What brand? Is the PSU powerful enough? There are many possible factors.
oculus,ffk0shf,t1_ffiu5i9,1580012321.0,"Yeah- there a billion HDDs out there. Many sold very cheaply. Lighthouses are expensive now because it is still relatively new tech. But if Valve really wanted VR to go mainstream, they should mass produce the crap out of the lighthouses and get them everywhere as cheap as possible. $100 for a pair."
oculus,ffk0nxe,t3_etz438,1580012214.0,I find games are most scary when you can’t fight back.
oculus,ffk0adw,t3_etxn8x,1580011897.0,"Anyone who tries Vr and goes “boring”- they are not the people I’d want to hang with.

Demoing to VR virgins is the best part of VR imo."
nba,ffjf7yq,t3_etymqp,1579996988.0,Giant vs giant. I think KP acted like he was going glass side and then took it to the front of the rim.
nba,ffjeddz,t3_etxt8t,1579996490.0,Filming him secret style at a strip club seems a bit scummy.
EverythingScience,ffjccfr,t1_ffixlol,1579995315.0,Living near an airforce base- I wonder about multiple decades of jet fuel leakage in the air or in the water. I don’t think the sound alone will dramatically increase mortality rates.
entertainment,ffjb0ei,t1_ffj1w2y,1579994525.0,"I can’t speak for him but he has made transphobic *jokes*— Does he think they shouldn’t exist? Not that I could tell. 

But in the end- he is a human being- and each human being is different. Not all of what they find important is going to be what you find important—-although you might agree on most other things. We are not a homogenous group. It’s a big tent, not a robot factory. It’s not all or nothing. Don’t let perfection be the enemy of good. Yadda yadda."
entertainment,ffjagez,t1_ffiu3ih,1579994205.0,"None of the media is “hard” left- including Msnbc. Bernie is hard left. These corporations don’t want a guy that might hurt their profits for the general well being of the populace (universal hc, example)."

oculus,ffhxxlk,t1_ffhtsrd,1579958698.0,He is talking about the S.
oculus,ffhxv85,t3_eto80d,1579958623.0,"Scratches. And then smell it, does it feel like it’s caked in sweat salt?- if I had access to it before hand those are the things I’d check. On eBay it’s not so easy."
oculus,ffhxori,t3_etjnkf,1579958420.0,"When playing physically intense games- use common sense. Would you soak any other electronic device in water? 

Towel off frequently- yourself and the headset. Disinfect after use with hypoallergenic wipes or something. Let dry before next use. Also- over time it will get nasty still- pulling the faceplate off and gently washing in a sink might be needed. 

Don’t use anything wet on lens though- wipe lenses with a dry cloth. 

Personally- I think they need to make the headsets with physical activity in mind. Water proof them more- use better sweat resistant materials and not the sweat soaking stuff that seems to be the trend."
oculus,ffhxcum,t3_etovck,1579958037.0,Oh boy- if this actually relieves the front heaviness of the Quest then buying it should be a no brainer. They should include them in the Quest boxes imo.
oculus,ffhwwnf,t1_fff2w9f,1579957513.0,FO4 VR has no seated mode. I had to download that Open VR tweaker to adjust the height. I ain’t playing that game for hours standing up.
oculus,ffhw0sh,t3_et84pe,1579956460.0,"Were the play testers playing seated? Most folks will play a little standing but then eventually defer to the chair. Even if one stands the whole game- squatting can get tiresome after a while- unless you got buns of steel. 

I think a button for squatting is a good thing. But also think that if a person physically squats, that should register as a squat button press.

As far as the barnacle- IDK how that was implemented so it could’ve been janky. Can only wait til release.

Also- who is “VR gamers” are we a homogenous group now with the same wants and needs?"
oculus,ffhvm9t,t3_etpv7t,1579955964.0,"6 dof VR- that is tracking rotation on 3 axis and tracking movement along 3 axis- The image is 3d and basically puts you visually (and audibly) into another space. The fidelity of the image depends on the headset’s resolution and your GPU. Right now the FOV is limited on most affordable headsets- it feels like you are looking through goggles with the periphery blocked. But still- it is very immersive and I haven’t demoed it to anyone yet who thought it was “meh”. Many described it, “It’s like I am on a hallucinogen!” Of course the newness of the experience fades as your brain normalizes the experience but if you haven’t tried VR- you will be in for a treat.

Watch a YouTube video of VR gameplay and know that the player- audio and visually is there in that game. Videos where the graphics don’t look impressive look way different in a headset."
oculus,ffhvan1,t1_ffhtjmx,1579955559.0,Speaking of Myst- playing Obduction now— perhaps Xing should be next.
oculus,ffh72wg,t1_ffg5nhm,1579924941.0,"I got a FB account that I haven’t used in years. I expect them to mysteriously connect my Oculus account with it somehow at some point and all my friends for years seeing my “high scores in VR Kanojo” without me knowing it.

Also- gaming with fucking strangers should ALWAYS be an anonymous experience. Or am I the crazy one for thinking this? FB is blowing. All hail Valve. They carry the torch now."
oculus,ffh69ez,t1_fffwb6a,1579924271.0,“So what should I download Skybox VR? I always see you using it.”
oculus,ffgll1q,t3_et4o9v,1579909058.0,"I honestly didn’t buy for porn but tried it out of course. I love posts where dudes say- my girlfriend wasn’t too keen on VR- but she likes it now. Or something like that. They aren’t “keen” because they don’t want their men bomping their baloney to other chicks. 

If it wasn’t for porn (I love VR porn) I guarantee there would be a higher female VR adoption rate. Chicks dig holodecks just as much as men."
virtualreality,ffgl8qc,t3_etfjrb,1579908825.0,"I was playing Obduction and there was a part with a cassette player. I was having a hard time hearing because they intentionally made the sound awful for “realism”— and I thought- these didn’t sound **that** bad. 

Then I thought back to kid me in the 90s listening to my walkman. I was intimately familiar with the whir of the tapes as they fast forwarded and rewound- etc. Now here is me in 2020 in VR getting the “cassette tape experience.” Not gonna lie- feeling old. I belong in a museum."
worldpolitics,ffgk854,t3_et1hcq,1579908141.0,I can’t believe that crazy vulgar awful woman was a judge- deciding whether people would to to jail or not. Who’s dick did she suck- she’s apparently okay with that. She loved Roger Ailes.
SteamController,ffghkk2,t1_fffjgy7,1579906394.0,It’s great for couch playing PC games designed for KB+M. I’ve only been playing non competitive games though.
Games,ffevjr2,t1_ffe1cqh,1579867362.0,I’m early 40s-  buying a console for a kid is what I’d do- I was a big Mac person from 18-35 but switched- Macs have always been overpriced but Apple has lost their minds on prices the last decade. Imo- abandoning non-rich artists- so I switched. Younger Mac owner me would not let a kid fiddle around with my computer. But yeah I’d imagine some richies would let their kids muck around with their status confirming expensive internet surfing Mac. I’d be like *“noooo- here is an Xbox Timmy- don’t bother daddy again.”*
