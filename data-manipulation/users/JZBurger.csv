""I did get a fix! It was something to do with my antivirus software (i had AVG), so disabling it allowed me to play online just fine - annoyingly simple. Obviously it probably isn't recommended to just turn off your antivirus stuff forever, so I uninstalled AVG and bought Norton Antivirus instead - no problems at all, game plays great. Probably a good idea to check your firewall exceptions/permissions, and try a different antivirus."" - https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7bz9cf/error_code_770/


""I figured it out, this is for PS4 and might help PC users. Create a static IP, the servers change and doesn’t allow the modem to connect as the IP changes. Once you have a static IP, port forward to battlefront server ports (can be found on EA) and turn on DMZ. I’ve been able to connect and play for a few days, it sucked but got me connected. As for PC, the rumor I hear is firewall issues with connecting. Here’s the email from EA, might help. I can’t say this will help, but I’m online, the email came after I did all of that on Saturday so it wasn’t EA’s instructions but it was close.
1 . Set up static IP

IP The local IP address of a console or PC can be set up in
two ways: it can be static or dynamic.

A dynamic IP address changes each time the console or router is restarted. If they made settings that rely on the IP address to stay the same (for example port forwarding), they would no longer work because the IP address has changed.

A static IP does not change. Therefore, it is often recommended to set up a static IP address in conjunction with other connectivity troubleshooting steps. Bear in mind that only the local IP should be changed, while the public IP can stay untouched.

For information on setting up a static IP address, you can check out portforward.com or contact your Internet Service Provider.


2. Set up DMZ for console IP

DMZ stands for ‘Demilitarized Zone’. It will open ALL the ports for a designated device. Opening all ports for a device is not something you would wish to do to a PC, as it leaves the entire network in an unsafe position. However, Xbox and PlayStation consoles have a built in security that we rank as ‘unbreakable’. As such, using DMZ mode for Consoles has no impact on network safety.

Positives
Powerful settings
If done correctly, almost guaranteed to solve the problem
Requires Static IP for the device

Negatives
Not applicable for PC issues
Requires Static IP for device
Only one device per network

For information on setting up a DMZ , you can check out portforward.com or contact your Internet Service Provider.
