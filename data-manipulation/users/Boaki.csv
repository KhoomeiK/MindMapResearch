Planetside,ff5w7hn,t3_erlu0i,1579612322.0,You can tell infantry mains are answering this question cause not a single person recommended the most useful construction item which is air terminal. There are tons of useful shit / fun to be had with construction. The people who are frustrated are the people overextending their bases on front lines without a full building support team. Of course your  base is gonna get wrecked when armor zerg rolls through. Of course your ANT is gonna get hunted by harassers everywhere.

Planetside,fec92wo,t1_fec8t7x,1578968814.0,"More horizontal and vertical for sure, but specifically the first bullet of betelgeuse has a huge kick compared to godsaw. You can easily line up for head and continue shooting for head with godsaw. Where with betel I find myself aiming for groin/lower chest(depending on range), otherwise you have to sharply compensate after first shot."
Planetside,fec8ggw,t1_fec384d,1578968477.0,"I still don't understand why betelgeuse kicks so much more than godsaw. And I don't want them to nerf godsaw, but it feels wrong saying buff betelgeuse."

AskReddit,fdoaddv,t1_fdnud78,1578601634.0,"Nah there is no replacement for just playing against other players. You're almost training yourself wrong by playing against bots since they don't play anything like humans. A lot of it is practicing fundamentals and training muscle memory. But you also need the part where you experience how other players out-play you, then try to figure out how to use those tactics yourself. And in doing so, other players will show you how to counter those tactics. Rinse, repeat, til you learn how to win in pretty much every situation."
