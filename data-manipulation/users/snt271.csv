There’s cameras and they would check everyone’s room too and kids don’t wanna do that because they’d get busted for other stuff even if they didn’t steal the laptop.

Also, you won't always get lucky. I missed out on a medium sized box that had the White House and Wall-E as well as some other pieces for $30.

Joining Lego groups isn't a bad idea either. I got the Lego Boeing 10177 for $145 including shipping and PayPal fees (missing box but had instructions and stickers un-applied) from a very nice old veteran selling off his old collection."

A couple months back I stared scouring Facebook marketplace in my area to see what was available and stumbled across the Fallingwater listed for $60 but with a damaged box and no instruction manual. Figured it was a fair deal and bought it. Apparently she had 14 other buyers who all wanted it but she didn't want to ship so I got it because I could drive to get it (though is did cost me $20 for a Zipcar).

A couple weeks later I bought the Robie House for $50 along (complete with instructions) and the Creator Expert Sydney Opera House for $100 from the same buyer. Surprisingly both real Lego and complete!"
