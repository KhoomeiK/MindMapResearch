TransSpace,ff6hoxa,t3_ersbk8,1579627430.0,"Wow, this was incredibly well written and extremely vivid to imagine every detail. Especially this part: ""Yesterday, when the shop owner corrected you, insisting the pewter sweater couldn't be for me, since it was designed for men, I saw that you grasped into the gaping void for the appropriate words and the void gave you emptiness. I couldn't stop smiling."""
AskReddit,ff65t30,t3_ero8mj,1579619830.0,They wouldn't even recognize me now. They literally would not believe everything I've done was even possible.

Oh how literal those words are.... Ehh."
GetMotivated,feo703a,t1_feo6khw,1579295917.0,"Is it typically females that say such comments to you? 

It's nearly exclusively females that say such things to me; especially at salons and other ""female only"" beauty type places."
GetMotivated,feo66kb,t1_fenjrtz,1579295652.0,"They treat underweight/thin people negatively in their own ways as well. ""Oh you're so lucky"", ""oh that's a good problem to have"".....   


Wish society was more balanced on their views and word choice. I'm pretty sure we all don't want to hear such words when dealing with such situations."

pathofexile,fei27lb,t3_ep4vln,1579128666.0,What?
AskReddit,feb0wag,t3_eo3q9l,1578954329.0,None because it's just the human body.
GetMotivated,fdr1jsu,t1_fdq04ja,1578678272.0,"Very true. So many people keep telling me how I'm organized and can get things done with ease but what they don't necessarily know is it didn't come easy. It literally took years of practice to finally get something decent.

I just wish I was better able to pass such an experience along to these newer people and tell them, just like this quote, that they too can do the same things if they just try."
science,fcb9h5g,t1_fcb94ro,1577584099.0,No. I was only mentioning an experience of mine and am unsure what my eyes look like when I find a woman aesthetically pleasing vs sexually attractive (demisexual so rare I outright find someone sexually attractive)
science,fcb1d99,t1_fcae0f6,1577580795.0,"It could be hormonal. While on testosterone I never viewed men sexually and focused on women. Two years later its complete opposite hormonally and I view men way more and notice women more for their style and how to learn from them than having sex with them, although once in a great while an opportunity will come up but it's rare."
science,fc3ik8p,t1_fc30ya7,1577390580.0,Cis people that transition forcefully end up having  Gender dysphoria.
curlyhair,fbfmg97,t1_fbf6si0,1576814272.0,"Thank you. 

It's still mind blowing people on here are saying such stuff about my hair considering how much struggle I went through to learn my hair and get here. Hair never came naturally so lots of effort was needed."
