Not high priority, but it may bring up more information of someone online with the correct spelling, if it is in fact spelled wrong."
UnresolvedMysteries,ffef41m,t1_ffdc9oi,1579845628.0,"A normal-ish life for her will never happen in Louisiana. Especially with the amount of filming & production the state has picked up. 

Also, everyone in La knows where her parents house is, her childhood home is, and the other hotspots that helped shape Britney. It would be hard for her to escape, unfortunately.

UnresolvedMysteries,ffe2j9l,t3_eswxy2,1579835019.0,"Whoever has control over Britney, is failing miserably. They need to control the content she posts on IG. 

I have loved her from day one, since she was a small town little celebrity in Louisiana, and we grew up just one parish apart. But lawd, her posts make me uncomfortable. But I can’t stop watching."

UnresolvedMysteries,ff7s820,t1_ff7q8id,1579657091.0,Of any case.. any single one out there.. this result of her being alive would FLOOR me. I can see so many other cases of a possibility that they left on their own accord.. but not this one. I just can’t.
YouShouldKnow,ff5b6nx,t3_erq1eq,1579585906.0,"I do this. And I will walk over to my alarm, snooze it and go back to sleep about 5 times before I even wake up. Once I finally wake up, I realize that I had already walked 5x to turn it off. No recollection of it."

UnresolvedMysteries,ff4tjw0,t1_ff4sz7n,1579572104.0,"No. It was a result of an inaccurate FBI profile. Law enforcement believed the man to be white. Went so far as to test thousands of DNA to Caucasian men. 

We knew what to look for. White male. White truck.

After doing a genealogy test, the results came back 80%+ being African American. Lee was a black man in a white truck. And he didn’t just rape women, he was convicted (or matched) to SEVEN brutal murders against women in our area, and sentenced to death. He died three years ago in prison due to heart disease.

EDIT TO ADD: His son has been in legal trouble too. After “accidentally” shooting someone. 

Shit is bizarre."
