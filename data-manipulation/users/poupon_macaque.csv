energydrinks,fen63gd,t1_fen5d5k,1579277792.0,Rockstars are $1 at Kroger owned stores right now. Not sure if they'll all have them stocked but I've also seen them at gas stations. I feel like they're an easy find and they're so good.
energydrinks,fejpj0k,t3_ep8uga,1579182512.0,Just got these in at the store I work at. My boss bought the entire case of the pineappel-orange-guava so I'm stuck buying the mango one. It's good but definitely the lesser of the two imo.
kroger,fegkm3e,t3_eo51p4,1579095657.0,Been thinking about transferring to Nashville division... this hasn't really made me reconsider it but honestly kind of makes me want to even more so. I could use some more action at work.
offmychest,fdq18nf,t1_fdq0tat,1578649840.0,"Absolutely. And I mean what I say. Nothing has helped me more in my own experience than talking to other heart dads about this and I will GLADLY talk to him about it if he wants. There are so many forms of CHD that not every body has the same experience but just understanding what someone is going through can give you a glimpse of what to expect, or give you an idea of what can go wrong and what can go right."
offmychest,fdq0gh1,t1_fdpzs60,1578648727.0,"I appreciate the kind words and I hope your nephew gets through it with no complications. It's a hard road to be stuck on but honestly I feel like it has made me appreciate my child more than I would if he had been born completely healthy. Please make sure your brother knows he is not alone in this and if he needs to, seek me out. I have met quite a few heart parents and have learned a lot from them and from my own experiences. It is a difficult path to be on but these babies are stronger than we expect. Honestly... in my 4 months being here I have seen families lose their babies to this but we've seen just as many overcome this. There's so many different outcomes to it all. My girlfriend and I will be praying for your family."

offmychest,fdjufi1,t3_elra79,1578487851.0,"I don't have any input really but I have a personal experience I'd like to share. Last year my girlfriend and I found out we were going to have our first child due this past September. We had SO hoped for a girl just because we wanted one I suppose. Girlfriend falls DEEP into depression not long after we find out and stays there throughout her entire pregnancy. We find out the gender, it's a boy! We're a little bummed but we just roll with it, what else can we do? 20 weeks in we are told there's something wrong with the baby's heart, not sure what but something's off. Time goes on, we're going to a regular OB, high risk OB and pediatric cardiologist every week. Mom is dreading every aspect of it. Giving birth, uncertainty if our baby will even survive once he's born, the looming open heart surgeries to keep him alive and of course the standard raising a child stuff. Feeling no attachment to baby whatsoever until she sees him in an ultrasound every few days and the doubts leave for a short bit. Hardly getting out of bed, having suicidal thoughts, unable to quit smoking and just not eating healthy. We've not been told with certainty if all this contributed to the congenital heart defects but you better believe mom blames herself for it and struggles with it every day. I will never blame her for this. She's always struggled with depression and anxiety and I can only imagine what all this felt like from her perspective. It's not been easy since our son was born. 2 cardiac arrests, over an hour total of CPR and 2 open heart surgeries with more down the road. It's been so hard on us, especially mom but I have watched her go from a terrified young woman to a loving, caring mother handling this situation the best she can. It's not smooth but I am amazed just by what she's overcome on her own and I'm extremely proud of her. Regardless, I will never truly understand what women go through during pregnancy other than it is HARD amongst many, many other things. I know it may not mean a whole lot coming from a stranger that will never truly get it but as far as I'm concerned you are absolutely justified in feeling the way you do. I hope you can find your way through these difficult times with grace and I hope your little ones are born happy and healthy."
wholesomememes,fdjpld1,t1_fdjjq39,1578482392.0,Since we're throwing out bands here Scar Symmetry is a Swedish melodic death metal band that got me into heavy music altogether. The Swedes have a knack for this stuff.

kroger,fdjnn1e,t3_elkn99,1578479699.0,You either have to maintain the fupa or watch where you're swinging it. Hopefully it's a lesson learned.
kroger,fdjnhc1,t3_elqqoc,1578479469.0,"This drove me absolutely nuts too. I'm a bit of a hypocrite because now I listen to music my whole shift but we're closed for 6 of those 8 hours but when you're in prime time hours or just any time of day where there's customers it's ridiculous. I would get so frustrated when I had to go outside to get the courtesy clerks because they can't hear me. Oh you were at the corral towards the end of the lot and didn't hear me page you 4 times by your FULL NAME? Buddy I've been there done that I know for a fact you can hear it loud and clear if those ears are empty. I'm in the same age group as all the courtesy clerks so I had thought maybe instead of them getting chewed out by a manager, I use Gen Z speak to explain how it's unprofessional and makes customers think less of us than they already do, it could possibly get through to them. It worked for a day and then they promptly forgot."
kroger,fdfk7u8,t3_el2c8s,1578363636.0,"I've been here 4 years. Have worked all over the store I'm at. Started as a courtesy clerk and moved up to floor supervisor after I turned 18. Got full time and spending 8 hours a day in that position made me absolutely miserable. Begged them to put me in grocery and somehow that turned into bouncing between dry, frozen and dairy as well as meat and of course still some front end shifts. The reason was always overscheduling in grocery. Finally a night crew member decided to come to days so we swapped and he quit not long after. That was last year and while we have a new manager that actually tries to give a shit the morale at this store is the lowest anyone has ever seen. However I'm comfortable in my position. 3 nights in dairy 2 nights grocery. I'm not the worst so they leave me alone in the mornings and I just rock the headphones all night. Grocery manager and store manager have been very respectful and generous accommodating my personal life. My son has been hospitalized since birth at a hospital 5 hours away and they don't hesitate to give me time off when I need it. It makes me feel kind of bad because everyone is complaining constantly and I'm just bitching to fit in. Overall I would rate the experience a 6/10 but currently I'd give it a 8/10."
modernwarfare,fdefcud,t3_ekxa3p,1578337806.0,"I have my mount set to when i ADS and it does feel pretty cheap when I round a corner, run into an enemy and automatically mount without even trying. It's got me killed a few times but more often than not it gives me an edge that people with my low skill and IQ level rarely ever have."

Cigarettes,fccysvk,t3_egz5p7,1577604286.0,I started smoking a few months ago at 20. I'll be 21 in a week so I'm not worried about the change but I buy my cigarettes at my workplace. I work overnight so TBH I just ring up my own cigs but the system doesn't catch the age change right now. If you have any Kroger owned stores nearby you might be able to get them there still.
daddit,f9trpie,t1_f9tq8ml,1575637284.0,Yes I am working full time. I'm kind of on the opposite side of your situation. I took 2 months off to be at the hospital but I'm also saving my FMLA for his next surgery that may come before I regain my 12 weeks. Initially I planned on taking 2 weeks off and that turned into 2 months. I've been at work for about 3 weeks now but I've only been back to visit once. He's in a hospital 4 hours away and our car can't really make that trip.
