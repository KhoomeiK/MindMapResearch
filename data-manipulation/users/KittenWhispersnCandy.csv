Also they will need to talk to their doctor to find the less expensive dosages/options.  Which can be random sometimes.  For example, one ex was $4 if you got 25 mg for 60 pills, but $100 if you got 50 mg for 30 pills so the rx was written as 2-25 mg 1x per day.  Etc

REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fgraysa,t3_ezzy5h,1581042417.0,"I got sober right before college.

I did have a slip a few weeks before my first year.

I was going to meetings, had a sponsor, etc. 

But I put myself in a situation where there was a lot of partying day and night (senior beach trip). Even though my companions knew I was sober, I still picked up about 2am on the 2nd day. I got tired. I got complacent.

I have 31 years sober now.

I learned to take this.shit.seriously.

That's basically what I learned from that relapse.

I use HALT a lot.

I still go to shows. I still go to parties.  But I ALWAYS have my car/way to leave and if I am in the least bit shaky/down/cravey/insecure...I don't go.  And I have been sober for eons. 

There are many, many fun opportunities in life. I do not have to go to every party.

For me, I had to really get loaded up with support. I went to 5-7 meetings a week (ASA/NA).  I had a sponsor. I went to coffee and lunch with sober people. I went to ICYPAA events.

I got a therapist too.

I was 100% (well, as much as I could) honest with my sponsor and therapist. It wasn't pretty.  But over time, I learned how to handle big big emotions and life.

I wish I had gotten serious and done the steps as written. But I am kind of a rebel, so it took me a few years to buckle down with that. To be truthful, that was the most effective thing I did in terms of improving how I felt.

I also ended up moving to a town that had lots more sober young people my sophomore year.  That made it very easy to intertwine my day to day life with sobriety.  I was in a sorority, so I still had  ""normie"" friends. But I spent the bulk of my time with other sober people.

Moving can be a ""geographic cure"" that doesn't stick. But I was going to college anyway so it made sense.

I still go to at least two meetings a week. More if things are tough.  I talk to sober people every day.  I still am working on doing steps.  I do service work. It is no big deal and not hard. It is just part of my life.  It has made life richer and more interesting in a bunch of ways.

I also still use a therapist when things are hard. I have a tendency to depression so I have to have outside help with that.

Anyway... it is possible to stay sober."

If I have to get up early, I use a sleep app that wakes me up a good time in my sleep patterns. Helps me be less groggy.

I do not expect myself to do anything other than rote activities until about 10am. I have accepted that I am not a morning person.  Creative work is better done for me at night.

But truthfully, losing your wife if 20 years was going to be traumatic at any time in your sobriety.

This is my time tested method for dealing with really, really hard things in sobriety. Divorce, death and serious illness included.

1.  Take care of basic needs in the gentlest, most pleasant way possible.  Food,water, sleep, exercise.  All extremely important. Eat things that make your body feel good.  Yor appetite may ebb and flow.  Eat light if you have no appetite, but eat 3x a day even if it is just a little. Smoothie King always helps me. And soup.

2.  Don't stay in bed all day, but recognize that I may not have the energy I usually do.  Grief takes energy. Nap if needed.

3.  If I feel like crying and wailing,  I do that.  My experience has been that most crying jags last around 20 minutes.  It may feel like my heart is ripping out in the moment, but I usually feel much better-off tired-after. Plus there is something very honoring about the grief of a loved one.  It passes quicker if I don't fight it. But I don't force it either. A lot if grief is just feeling muffled.

4. Go to a meeting everyday and talk about how I feel.  This is the perfect time to do 90 in 90.  It has served me extremely well.  You will need something to do,a reason to get up and are new enough that you need to build relationships in sobriety.  This will help with all of that. If people are going out for coffee or meals after the meeting, go. It us acceptable to mention when you speak that you are looking fir people to go have coffee with.  Be open to new friends. Some of my best AA friends are wildly different ages and backgrounds. Has made my life so rich.

5. Have a loose routine.  Talk to retired friends about their routines.  A whole lotta people get up and meet a group out for breakfast.  Note that breakfast AA meeting exist for this reason.  You are developing a new routine due to two very major changes in your life.  Be kind to yourself and build a life you like.  Maybe you want to hit golf balls in the morning, then go get coffee and read the paper, hit a lunch meeting, go to the gym, eat some dinner, etc.  Or maybe you have a hiking group on Saturday, church on Sunday and garden during the week. Or maybe you travel with your biking group every second week and go to punk shows on Thursdays.  Or you have glassblowing class on Tuesdays and Thursdsys and volunteer with the Boy Scous on Wednesdays. Friday and Saturday you go to shows or hike. Try stuff. Find your rhythm.  Read Martha Beck's The Joy Diet which is about finding a pattern of life that brings you joy. Not about food. 


6.  Accept friendship and support.  Go to the lunch,  meet for coffee, go to the grief support group, meet with the pastor.  Take all that you can stand.

7.  Have a plan for when cravings hit.  This is where sponsors can be helpful. I go to the movies. Others run. Most everyone calls somebody.

8. Consider volunteering. Doing for others is incredibly soothing to my soul and literally gets me ""out of myself"".  

9. Consider getting a pet - if you want one and if you plans don't include lots of spur of the moment travel. I have been single most of my sobriety.  Having someone to come home to is nice. Dogs count.  Foster if you don't want the committment.  Fostering pets is one of my fav things ever.

10. Get a therapist. People have marveled at my ability to handle very tough stuff with equanimity. It is because I layer up with support.  I do not tough it out.
