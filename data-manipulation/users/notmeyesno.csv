beta,fgs0glw,t1_fgrcgdb,1581065272.0,"Officially, comments are collapsed when they get lots of downvotes - you can set the threshold in desktop settings. However, there's some secret algorithm that collapses *unfavorable* comments, some with hundreds of upvotes, so you have to press the + to see them. The casual user scrolls past them."
beta,fgqbh6t,t1_fgp2ssh,1581021244.0,People should be notified if their comment is removed. There's also the arbitary 'collapsing' comments that are unfavorable.

beta,fgk4veo,t1_fgh76wv,1580857535.0,"That sounds like the worst case scenario. Very few people notice it and even fewer would dwell on it and temporarily change their behavior. Most people would be like, 'oh look I got a green button and my buddy got a blue one! haha' and move on (even for bigger changes). Besides, these tests are done on large sample sets and take an error rate into consideration. Reddit has over 300M MAU."

beta,fgh1qht,t1_fggt2ck,1580774617.0,Is it really 'tainted' if they know? You're just measuring results based on user behavior and actions. It's not like a drug trial where someone found out they're on a placebo.

UpliftingNews,ff8ngu6,t1_ff8kqqp,1579687382.0,"The problem is, they pass these laws too late and without much knowledge. The damage is already done by the large companies and they have procedures in place to still collect data. They have overpaid lawyers who calculate if it's more profitable to break the law and pay the fine. 

This ends up effecting the smaller companies, like the link above who may not be doing anything devious but have to spend money for the full compliance. There are another set of shark lawyers ready to prey on these smaller companies based on technicalities. Google makes over $100M a day in revenue, they're still collecting and using your data for ads."
