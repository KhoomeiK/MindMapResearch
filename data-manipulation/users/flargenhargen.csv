the cruelty is insane when we read about it, but it's like most things happening even today.   eye for an eye kind of thing.   some of the most cruel things are done in the name of revenge,  which is human nature.
 
if you actually read the history nearly all of these massacres on both sides were  revenge and escalation for previous killings.  And people in the revenge business like to go overboard and escalate things.

Indians would be killed, and would then kill settlers in retribution and the cycle would continue.  It's human nature and has been going on like this since the beginning of time.  It's easy to do really awful things to people once you think they've done awful things to you.

I read one story of a settler family with small children and the natives tortured and killed the family and blinded the two year old and cut her legs off at the knees, so she was found blindly walking through the desert on her stumps. 
 
and of course the cycle would continue, and in this particular case, the revenge consisted of some indian teenagers not even from the same group, who had done nothing wrong,  being rounded up for a trial, and then told to run so they could be shot while ""escaping""

it's a very complicated and extremely sad web of events, and pretty much everyone involved has a tragic tale.   the ""dumb"" thing would be to stay ignorant of the stories, background, and history."
