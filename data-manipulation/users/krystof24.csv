While he isn't CEO for years Microsoft is still connected to him (he's on board and choose many people who are now in charge). And I would say they also improved a lot. And compared to corporations like Facebook and Alphabet they seem pretty good. (Disclaimer: this is coming from C# programmer)"

Besides not everybody is capable of doing these jobs. Uni isn't representative, because it's those who discovered that they like it/are good at it, but back in highschool. How many people were good at these subjects? When I look at my clases. Out of cca 15 guys  (who opted into programming seminar!) It was me and another guy who were head and shoulders above others. 4 guys who were decent, 5 who somehow managed to do the (extremely simple) tasks and rest was barely passing (teacher did her best to let them make it).

And that's entry level. Data scientists, mathematicians,... My friend who thought-out highschool placed decently in national math, logic  and chemistry competition noted that none of us (I believe we were the best class at school best at our region, we reguraly won regional physics/math competitions) were fit to be mathematicians.
