NobodyAsked,ffdf2g9,t1_ffddn63,1579819528.0,"I mentioned above that I think it's considered ""nobody asked"" because the comment was directly specifically to Tilda.  If it had not been directed towards a single person and just a regular comment on the post, it would have been fine."
NobodyAsked,ffdewyn,t1_ffd9xwc,1579819434.0,"I think it's because the comment was directed specifically to Tilda.  If it had just been a comment on the post, it would have been fine, but because it was directed at someone, it became a ""nobody asked""."
TalesFromRetail,ffbzcnf,t1_ffboww2,1579787490.0,"I want to say that Mythbusters did a segment on which type of queuing system leads to the shortest wait and found that individual lines actually had a shorter average waiting time per customer, but customer satisfaction was higher with a single line that separated to the multiple cashiers because the perception was that this type of queue was more ""fair"".  Don't quote me on this because I didn't look it up and I could be talking out my ass right now."
BadMUAs,ffb2o7v,t1_ffb2htm,1579750262.0,"I understand where you’re coming from, but if you’re advertising a product like lipstick, which this picture is, I would think that they would take the time to ensure that their product is being shown in the most positive way. But I guess the ad is working though because we’re all taking about it."
BadMUAs,ffb1y2x,t1_ffazq36,1579749755.0,There is no problem with her face. The problem is with the way they applied her lipstick.
SelfAwarewolves,fe9xuen,t1_fe9cakz,1578942401.0,"Wait, are you saying the problem is that companies are advertising towards their entire targeted demographic instead of just white males 18-45?"
AskReddit,fdndj6g,t1_fdm6toa,1578583493.0,"I used to do something similar.  I would sneak out of the house, but always leave a note as to where I went."
fatlogic,fddn160,t3_ekn7m2,1578318278.0,"I don't care what men think of my body, not even my husband (and he's been around through fat and skinny and now he's seeing strong)!  I go to the gym to make my body appealing to MY gaze, and no one else's!"
fatlogic,fcvx7wa,t1_fcvwgzt,1578012153.0,You don’t understand speed. The average regular person walks at 3.1 mph. The average New Yorker walks at 3.9.  7 mph is almost twice as fast as the average New Yorker. The average man runs at 8.3 mph and the average woman at 6.5.  You are way off on your numbers and I suggest you look again. Usain Bolt has been clocked at just under 28 mph a his fastest and you think the average person can sprint at 20?
fatlogic,fcvvluc,t1_fcvv34t,1578011102.0,"A quick walk is about a 15 minute mile. A slow pace would be around 20 minutes. 

Just because a 10-12 minute mile is slow for you, doesn’t mean it’s slow for everyone else."
rage,fcvjtec,t3_ej0sxg,1578003613.0,"What annoyed me about the article was the person who was quoted saying something about how it was amazing watching these dogs learn about things like going up and down stairs, getting in and out of cars, and things like that ""that dogs in the United States take for granted"". I don't think dogs can take things for granted."
BikiniBottomTwitter,fcr0fqi,t1_fcqnbtk,1577894942.0,Yeah. I read it that way at first also. The meme says that they realized that the roaring 20s ended in the Great Depression. I forgot to read the “in” also. And then I was very confused that no one was pointing that out. So I reread it. I hate when I skip words when reading. It makes things very confusing sometimes.
DiWHY,fck1m5k,t3_ehl009,1577713811.0,"We have backyard chickens and now I want to paint and glitter some of the egg cartons, just to jazz them up a bit."
IdiotsInCars,fbdhahh,t1_fbd8tai,1576762139.0,"Nope, a lot of people don't know how to spell and apparently don't understand the concept of homophones."
