wikipedia,ffd8ft9,t1_ffc2k4p,1579815450.0,Well perhaps years of not listening to people talk Italian might have not sharpen my ears its subtleties but I think I am pronouncing right enough to stay alive. It might be that when read in French it sounds completely different.
wikipedia,ffbv7vb,t3_eshvg6,1579783885.0,Ok so how is it accurately pronounced?

familyguy,fepbw2u,t1_fep7bx7,1579316743.0,I don’t know how you ended up with the art grants but you’re not going to convince me to keep feeding royalty because we sometimes spend money on other follies.
ninjawarrior,fepb16s,t3_eq47b2,1579316169.0,I can’t seem to be able to locate the link of your video. Could please provide it in a reply to my humble comment?
familyguy,fep6xim,t1_feoyz69,1579313506.0,"I’m Canadian as well and I think our relationship with royalty is very weird and that we should just leave them to the Brits. It such a bad use of our money, especially when you realize all the assets they already have. Plus all those lieutenant governors that keep getting in hot water for extravagant expenses. It’s a part of our heritage, big deal. We can remember them without paying them."

EDC,fdw68ix,t1_fdvpcgw,1578755452.0,Well unless it’s a rubbery at knife point. If they want you dead it’s different. If it’s just people acting tough on you and you pull out a knife I’m not sure how well that’s going to end.
