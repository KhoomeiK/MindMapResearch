Edit: I mean, she did the Yulon dog festival doc, has an adoption agency, rescues dogs, donates a ton of money, clearly loves animals, etc.  Kam made a dog food line that is/has failed.

Why am I being downvoted?  Am I missing something?"
greatdanes,fev7xt2,t3_eqo925,1579394265.0,"Crate training is essential!  Gives them a safe space and should never be used for punishment.  Makes house breaking easy and you dont have to worry about your house being torn apart.  

A few other things I can think of.  Pick up your shoes!  Mine ate about $800 worth of fancy heels in 1 sitting.  My fault.  

Dog parks for socialization, 2 or 3 times a week but keep an eye when they are little, mine accidentally tore a shoulder muscle playing too hard.  They grow so fast so they can be a bit brittle for a year and lanky. 

No playing 30 min before or after eating.  Bloat is an issue.  Get the stomach tacked during neutering if possible. 

Not allowed in the kitchen when eating or cooking. No beggars.  They ste big enough to counter surf and once he is a certain size, it becomes impossible to enforce if you dont start early. 

Play with the paws.  They get used to it and dont freak out when nail trimmings happen.

Leash training early on with positive reinforcement is a must!  Can have a 170 lb dog dragging you!

If I think I of more, I'll post.  Congratulations!  Beautiful pup!

Edit... all of these teach manners and confidence.  Helps in all situations."
