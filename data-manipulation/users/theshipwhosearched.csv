personalfinance,fek7d09,t1_fek6hvv,1579194134.0,A funeral home or cemetery absolutely will repossess a casket/plot. It used to be a part of my job to be present for any disinterment that my company's product was used in in my state. Family will capitulate pretty quickly in those situations. Pre need cremation only if this is your plan.

worldnews,fdlq73m,t1_fdk31gd,1578529872.0,Seems like a valid fear.
todayilearned,fd621xx,t1_fd5yijg,1578184467.0,Nope. I was just trying to add that even if your state doesn't allow it to be claimed anonymously there are still ways without having your name attached.
todayilearned,fd5y2ir,t1_fd5c8c9,1578182946.0,Even in states where you don't get to claim as a trust to hide your name there are so many ways around that. Especially if you win enough that a little extra tax burden is meaningless.
