You could do color based names such as Mithril (the shiny strong silver metal from LOTR). Cute and unisex.

How would that work when they have more responsibilities and she can’t afford to have him basically gone for 4 of his free hours?

He should also just be going to bed earlier overall rather than cutting up his sleep by using a nap, naps throw your sleep cycle off. 

My recommendation would be to start with sleep hygiene. Pretend he has a sleep disorder, do everything a sleep doctor recommends. That’s what I did and it was a night and day difference. 

I changed what my place of sleep looked like because I’d associated the bed with ruminating on lack of sleep and anxious thoughts. I got better pillows. I got very strict about my phone usage. I used a sleep mask and headphones with music or podcasts interesting enough to keep my wandering thoughts on the topic but not so interesting I stayed awake. I made sure to use a heat pad to relax my back. I put a barrier pillow between myself and my partner to minimize feeling it if one of us shifted a lot during the night. An extra blanket so I wouldn’t wake up due to cold. Going to bed two hours earlier."

Am I likely to die from the flu? No, I’m fact i likely wouldn’t even need a doctor visit. Unless my work requires a note and will fire me after 4 days of illness.

AskReddit,ffkxunj,t1_ffjk8m7,1580030936.0,"I had the opposite problem. I recently got my medical records. I could see my weight from early teens to now (24). I was on the low end of normal for my entire teens. Then I met my future husband, who was comfortable (upper working class/lower middle class I’d say). He’d feed me every time we went on a date. And we had a lot of dates early on. Eventually, I moved out, with him. And suddenly I went from lower end of normal to overweight. I tried to lose weight and lost 16lbs over one summer then plateaued. I have struggled to sustain weight loss because I have health issues preventing me from all the good calorie burn stuff like hard exercise. Diet restriction helps but I’m petite and female so I literally had to go down to 800 calories a day to lose the recommended amount of weight per week. I was miserable because I had food insecurity issues, it was hard to say no to food when it was available. 

A year after moving out I have gotten better. I deal with it by going to grocery stores for fun just to look around and remind myself I could literally purchase endless food for $20, and then I don’t feel the drive to actually do so. Plus I’m working on lifestyle caloric burn since I just can’t seem to burn many calories just day to day. I walk the dog as often as I remember (which delights her) instead of the minimum, cut out one meal a day for good (just lunch and dinner now), and switched to keto because it’s the only diet I’ve found that moderates my sugar crashes and hunger. It’s the hunger I can’t tolerate."
personalfinance,ffc7sck,t1_ffc65z7,1579793504.0,"Full disclosure: I only have a credit card through my new spouse, I only ever had and still have debit cards for my money. 

Credit cards are good for your credit score but only if you pay off your debt regularly. It’s not good to just let large amounts sit there. Going close to your credit card limit can ding your score. They are also excellent from an identity theft perspective, way easier to cancel hypothetical money than real money (which is why I agreed to a credit card, debit has way less protections)."
personalfinance,ffc70jw,t1_ffc5t34,1579793005.0,"That amount is going to vary depending who you ask here, because some people feel most secure with giant savings, others with investments, and others with a comfortable day to day life rather than scrimping. So, it’s about how much risk you are willing to tolerate, and how much quality of life you are aiming for. 

Your savings are on the small end for a family with two kids and a 140k salary. A good rule of thumb most people are comfortable with is six months of living expenses saved up in liquid savings, and then half the current take home pay (half of them 83k) elsewhere like investments (for retirement, kid college funds, any future expenses).  That covers most people for stuff like suddenly losing your job, a sudden injury for a child, main breadwinner getting really sick, mom gets sick so dad needs to employ childcare more for a while, the main car gets totaled, etc. 

You can afford the mortgage now, but you wouldn’t have much of a cushion. So it’s up to you. If your kids are healthy and your husband’s job and health are super stable, you could gamble and just get the house now. It will obviously help later when you rejoin the workforce, but I’m also assuming you save the family a lot right now by taking care of the kids and all the other household duties you cover. 

If you go through with the house, general advice is to save 10% of the house value for house repairs, because owning usually comes with big ticket items like a new roof occasionally. 

To summarize: I’d shoot for six months living expenses plus 41,500k invested/long term saving. If you only do one thing though obviously do the living expenses one, that’s the most practical. Then I’d make sure to save 10% of whatever the house value is for the house repairs fund so you aren’t using current income on it. That will ensure you can maintain what you do now where you don’t really think about money. 

You said your situation is stressful, and you didn’t clarify if that was due to the small space and renting, or if it was something else. That should help you decide which of my suggestions to focus on. It doesn’t do anyone good if your mental health suffers because of a current problem the new house would solve. I hope this helps! Remember your mental health is important, mothers are the mood ring of the family. :)"
personalfinance,ffc4kv3,t3_esu198,1579791377.0,"Why do you have 12k in credit card debt? If you are considering 3,800 in mortgage payments you could get rid of the debt by buying a house three months from now instead. If it’s student loans the interest isn’t worth it and you should pay it off entirely. 

Overall, you’d need to tell us how much you actually have in expenses monthly and where it goes. If you have significant money left over every month then yes, you probably can afford the proposed rate. If you’re living paycheck to paycheck or have no savings, then it may be better to rent within your means. It’s easier to have small kids in a small house than it is to have big kids in a small house, and saving aggressively now means you could get a bigger house when it matters more (May also give you the chance to get a better school for the kids)."

You can have lack of sense of smell, hypersensitive smell, hypersensitive to certain smells (common with people who have aspergers, autism, even temporarily caused by pregnancy, etc). 

To answer the actual OP: we’d need help with what your problem is exactly, if it’s genuinely irritation, it sounds like you are allergic to some component of yourself. This is totally possible. There are people allergic to water but who obviously can still drink it(with a straw) because it only affects their skin and mucus membranes. The human immune system can be quite weird.

todayilearned,ff9n221,t1_ff9hpkz,1579716430.0,"So, my dad worked quite a while for the US in military spy satellites. They have an office for it, it’s called the NRO. The NRO will probably be rolled into the new Space Force. He’s always been really interested in engineering even though he ended up a manager. Anyways, he worked with a lot of smart PhDs whose job was to research at the edges of current knowledge. The US literally has scientists whose job is to go to conferences and hunt for new or possibly revolutionary tech( my dad wanted me to apply for that type of job). Then they get the rights to it, bring it back and our PhDs work on it. It’s all highly classified so the average joe and even the average person with a TS/SCI clearance won’t have access. He is of the opinion that true, passionate scientists should want to work for the military on classified stuff because that’s how you find out the really cool stuff. He couldn’t tell me what the topics were, but he could tell me that their tech is on average 30 years ahead of civilian tech. My father in law knew a scientist who got close to finishing his PhD and got raided and told he couldn’t publish his work because they knew a possible derivation from it could help foreign powers make better missiles. It really sucked for that guy. 

I love science but I chose not to go into either DARPA or anywhere else military because I fundamentally couldn’t live with myself if I made a physics or medical breakthrough that could help masses of humanity and had to just sit on it because the military didn’t want to reveal they were ahead of the civilian world.
