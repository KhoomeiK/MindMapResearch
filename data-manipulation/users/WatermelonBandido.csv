Also, I think it's a good idea to keep Cowboys in the NFC and Texans in the AFC. Helps with TV broadcasts."

relationships,fepa1rb,t3_eqanfx,1579315512.0,It's supposed to be a game. It's like stealing money in Monopoly.
nfl,feoy4me,t1_feo13yh,1579307915.0,I'd imagine they allow only one year but you have to pay the 40.
nfl,felanuy,t1_fekl428,1579217741.0,I lost my entire family to kicking nets.
petsmart,fej050a,t3_epb2c4,1579152227.0,I use Simply Nourish Fish and Brown Rice for my dogs. I'd avoid grain free and limited ingredient until there's more science behind it. I'd look up the problems with those diets. /r/dogs are very up in arms about how Purina Pro Plan is the best due to that report but I think I'm waiting it out.

Shudder,fdppph9,t1_fdnlerp,1578635863.0,"Uh there's been plenty of problems with the channel features from Amazon and Apple. The two main things are missing titles and no live channels which are used for events like Joe Bob. I also like to put on the stream when I need background noise while doing something. Another thing is not being able to buy discounted subs.

Just go through Shudder, guys. Or if you have a shitty debit card (payroll/prepaid card) that can't be used with Shudder, I used to sub through Roku website which let me use the regular app."
