news,feh6hg7,t1_feh4z2j,1579110153.0,"The issue in the eyes of the FAA is, as you point out, the engine out go-around.  And if you look at an MEL for an airplane that has fuel jettison installed the operating restriction will be to check that  you can comply with the approach climb (engine out go-around) case without dumping at your planned takeoff weight.

Or, for many airplanes, there will be no restriction at all.  Such airplanes can meet the single engine go-around requirements in all cases.  That is to say, if they meet the takeoff climb requirements they will meet the approach climb requirements.  On such airplanes fuel jettison is often an option, and many airlines won't take it.

Consider it this way.  You are lined up on 25R at LAX for takeoff.  You are able to accelerate to V1, then reject the takeoff and come to a stop.

V1 and Vref are fairly close.  So now you are airborne and returning  to 25R.  You landing speed is fairly close to that V1 in the first case, but you are landing in the first part of the runway so you have a lot more runway in front of you in which to stop.  And you have a higher flap setting.  

I am not saying that this is a casual decision -- far from it.  Especially if there are complications such as tire damage or hydraulic issues.  At the same time, holding while dumping fuel *when you don't need too* is increasing the time that you are flying around on only one engine, often over water."

""Takeoff flight path"" and its friend, ""Net takeoff flight path"" are by definition with an engine out.  The weight limit referred to 121.189(a) is what is commonly called the WAT limit, and it is also by definition engine out.  

121.189(a) is the minimum climb performance even if the runway is pointed towards an ocean.  The rest of the reg deals with clearing obstacles, which must also be considered.
