You're the lone person objecting to calling a child fucker a pedo because you want to be specific and call them a hebephile. They're kids. Even if they are teens they are kids. And if you wanna fuck them then you're a pedophile and deserve everything that comes your way because of it.

But I did just buy an Orange Kong-pressor and I love that thing. I pair it with my Green Rhino overdrive and this little Jimi Hendrix pedal (Gypsy Fuzz) and its got a real cool sound.

What's the story with the headphone amp? If you don't mind me asking"
todayilearned,fg18fih,t1_fg15vl3,1580422693.0,I slammed a couple car bombs so I'm feeling super reasonable (jk)
IncelTears,fg15opa,t1_fg15ab2,1580421249.0,I kinda forgot the topic. what amp/pedals do you use?
IncelTears,fg13rlh,t1_fg13dnn,1580420174.0,It's not all that horribly exciting unfortunately. I had a 2004 Les Paul Studio and a  Martin DRS-1. They're not all that nice but I still like them. Not like chad guitar nice but I think they're nice. Since then I also got an american strat and tele which is fun!
todayilearned,fg13egn,t1_fg13717,1580419986.0,I should have specified I was talking about the irish car bombs with that. Sorry if I wasn't clear.
