MouseReview,feew0sj,t1_feebamg,1579042425.0,"i like my basilisk ultimate!

the viper ultimate hurt my had because of my grip style and hand size, so i had to return it.

the basilisk is sexy as hell tho and i’m liking it!"
gatekeeping,fedky96,t1_fedkwu3,1579014100.0,finally a comment i can agree with
gatekeeping,fecjr5j,t1_fecjjil,1578975602.0,"thanks gatekeeper, much appreciated"
ClashRoyale,fecjq92,t1_fecj2yj,1578975586.0,"i’m not super high in trophies, around 5300-ish, but it’s my main custom deck yeah. i tweaked it a bit over time but i used it since the ice arena.

it’s great at picking towers, because it gives the extra oomph to get it to the tower and land multiple hits. i’ll back it with fire spirits or a skarmy depending on opponents deck (fire spirits for minions for example and skarmy for inferno tower).

as much as my deck has been tweaked over time, rage has been a staple in it."
gatekeeping,fechqr1,t1_fecgz3l,1578974207.0,it sounded so ridiculous it got a laugh out of me Lol
ClashRoyale,fecf6bz,t3_eodoxs,1578972458.0,"it needs to keep its duration. i use it for balloon pushes,  and it’s duration is really important to land those shots off.

if there were a heal mixed in to that duration, that would be incredibly helpful! i like the idea."
gatekeeping,febq29t,t1_febipau,1578961463.0,"or gatekeeping “show-ers”, we don’t discriminate here"
gatekeeping,febpyjb,t1_febpgst,1578961424.0,i mean depends on who you’re asking
razer,fe64rmz,t3_envnuk,1578881769.0,congrats!!
razer,fe64kvz,t3_enodz0,1578881650.0,"i got mine two days ago!

i had to send back my viper because it hurt my hands, although i loved everything else about the mouse! this gave me the comfort my hands needed while also delivering on everything else. and the weight is just right."
razer,fe2whyf,t1_fe2qc78,1578843653.0,"okay thanks mate i’ll give it a go, much appreciated"
razer,fe27cio,t1_fe0ocqs,1578835228.0,"yup, this. i really do love razer for everything else, i’ve heard their products for years with no issue!

but with any of their audio options, wether it’s desk speakers, IEMs, or headphones, i know there’s objectively better options that’ll give you much better for the same or less money.

i was going to get their desktop speakers and i asked about it in r/audiophile . someone spent the time to recommend a completely different setup for me including a receiver, speaker wires and all (for a home entertainment system). it was for the exact same price, and i’m so happy i went with it!"
razer,fe26fxx,t1_fe0lgnj,1578835011.0,is it normal that it isn’t switching profiles in general? there’s no dpi change or anything
razer,fdzvjqr,t3_enf3i4,1578796812.0,"i don’t think this will be a popular opinion here because this is a razer subreddit, but i don’t recommend their headsets.

i absolutely love their mice, keyboards, and other peripherals. i think they’re well made and durable.

but when it comes to audio, i recommend you look elsewhere.

although it wasn’t the nari ultimate, i owned the kraken and i found the design cheap and hurt my head to wear. the plastic, for example. i’ve heard others recommend razer for other products but not particularly their audio.

if i had to recommend, maybe something like Sennheiser’s? or you could ask on r/headphones, they usually know what they’re talking about :P

personally i use the Phillips Fidelios x2HR. i use it for music and gaming, altho i’m sure you could find better for gaming. i really do recommend asking in that other sub tho.

ultimately it’s up to you though, i’m just trying to give my take on it from what i’ve seen."

MouseReview,fdvmdhy,t1_fdvkey0,1578748998.0,"well thank goodness you tripped going up the stairs instead of flying down them, which makes me wince thinking about how hurt and how much pain your mouse could have been in"

MouseReview,fdodzkl,t1_fdobyh0,1578603380.0,"i’m 18x10, so i’m not entirely sure what that would be considered.

i did use the viper ulti before but had to send it back because my hands couldn’t adjust"
ClashRoyale,fdo8q0x,t1_fdo7knf,1578600831.0,"that’s true, but all the other points stand, and there would still be money being donated that otherwise wouldn’t have been"
educationalgifs,fdo6jqv,t3_em1ujq,1578599762.0,my dog doesn’t do any of these
ClashRoyale,fdo6eat,t1_fdo3a2b,1578599687.0,"for a couple reasons.

1- this helps spread awareness. especially if people are using the emote around in-game

2- makes it easy to donate (straight off the app)

3- a fun way to encourage others to donate

4- directly targets a specific community

5- can see what the community can accomplish together

and of course there’s always the option to donate directly, if that’s more your style :)"
selfimprovement,fdnvq5l,t3_em8vt9,1578593815.0,"hey mate, if you genuinely want to improve and try to recover from this, i don’t think you’re going to find it in a single comment.

i want to give you the best help that i can. and i genuinely feel like this is one of the most perfect fits for you.

i cant recommend enough for you to read “Self-Help for your Nerves” by Dr Claire Weekes. she addresses nervous illness all throughout the book and if you genuinely apply her words and try, i’m confident you will at the very least improve.

don’t pass over this comment. because i read your post and it instantly reminded me of her book. i just read a chapter each night.

best of luck man"
ClashRoyale,fdnve2c,t1_fdnv48u,1578593619.0,you’re joking right
MouseReview,fdn0wxf,t3_em2irv,1578573858.0,"hey! thanks for the review.

what’s your hand size? would it fit palm grip? i mainly use palm, but often my pinky and ring finger don’t get support on other mice and end up hurting one way or another"
Advice,fdk4ir3,t1_fdk4eg9,1578495863.0,thank you for the response! i’ll mention it to my therapist next time i see him. helped

MinecraftMemes,fdfciov,t3_el0efs,1578358467.0,not this again
MouseReview,fdbddr6,t3_ekakad,1578256262.0,"hey, would the razer basilisk ultimate be a good fit for me?

my hands are 18x10, and i use strictly palm grip.

the razer viper made my ring and pinky finger pretty sore because it felt small in my hand and the way the ambi design curved inwards, i didn’t have much to hold to. comfort is important to me.

the basilisk being an ergo mouse, i’m hoping things would be different.

any feedback would be incredibly helpful!"
razer,fd870wr,t3_ejrdmn,1578214592.0,"hey, how’s the basilisk ulti treating your hand? i’m 18x10 palm and i’m worried my hand will hurt using it.

setup looks great tho, nice :)"
