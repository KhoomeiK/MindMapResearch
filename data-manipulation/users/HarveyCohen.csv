I also workout fasted because I prefer to eat most of my food later in the day. 

Good job getting in exercise! It’s great for your health"

I lost 60+ lbs in 5 ish months and I didn’t have loose skin. 


Just an FYI the minimum healthy weight for your height is 122. My best advice is to continue losing and reevaluate as you go. You may find yourself changing you goal weight.

fatlogic,ffa5kwh,t3_esif8n,1579728323.0,"Found this post on insta and read through the caption which was full of intuitive eating “tips” promoting unlimited eating from the source instead of proportioning. The infuriating part is that at the  very end it was labeled #ad. 

This insta personality has lots of posts like this revealing diet “myths”  all are bs"
loseit,ff784ch,t1_ff70wlz,1579642986.0,"Since you’ve been trying to lose for a year it’s worth being accurate on your calorie counts for a few weeks to a month to see if there’s any change. 

Weight and log everything you eat, you should see some loss at 1500 calories a day. An online tdee calculator has maintenance calories for someone your size at around 1700 calories If your sedentary. 


Keep in mind even if you don’t see changes on the scale you’re making healthy changes to your life and that’s awesome!"
fatlogic,ff76761,t1_ff73jzx,1579641913.0,This makes me sad. I don’t want a generation of unhealthy obese children
loseit,ff51qgs,t3_eronvq,1579577867.0,"Ok first you need to figure out how many pounds you need to lose to fit into your dress. How close is it to zipping comfortably? 

Next take things slow because you have about 9ish months. Start by buying a food scale and tracking EVERYTHING you eat. Then after about a week you’ll have a good estimate of how many cals your currently eating a maybe see some areas to cut back. Eating 500-1000 calories fewer than you burn will allow you to lose 1 to 2lbs a week. 

Trust me buying a food scale now and using it from the beginning will save you a lot of heart ache. 

Exercise is great for fitness and body composition but you don’t necessarily need it to lose weight. I would wait until you’re comfortable tracking your calories before adding it in. It can seem overwhelming to handle many new tasks at once. 

Good luck!"
