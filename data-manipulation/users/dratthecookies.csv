Your girlfriend needs to see a therapist and to not be dating anyone at all. She most definitely needs to go no contact with her ex, because he is working hard to pull her right back into the same abusive situation, and so far it's working. No contact *at all.* Quit rowing club if she has to, and tell someone at your school what's going on so she can get support.

movies,ffmftc1,t1_ffjiboo,1580054086.0,"I haven't seen ""The Farewell"" but the reviews were phenomenal. I was really y shocked that it didn't get nominated, and I bet it's because no one else watched it either. 

I think there's just a tendency to vote for people you already know do good work. A few years ago ago  Meryl Streep was nominated for a movie she was in as a cameo. It was obvious people just said ""well she does good work she probably deserves it"" but if I were her I would have been embarrassed to win for that. I could understand if she'd never won before and the competition was slim that year, but come on.

There is definitely a race and gender aspect to it, whether people think so consciously or not. I guarantee no one saw the Farewell because the cast was majority Asian and there was no blockbuster buzz to compel people to watch it. Black Panther and Get Out were massively popular movies, anyone who went to the movies saw them. But a movie with a minority cast that is good but not very popular commercially would struggle to be nominated. People will just vote for the names they already know, which are traditionally white and male."
