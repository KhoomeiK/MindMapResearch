rareinsults,ffeanac,t3_et0mkz,1579841402.0,"ITT: People who don't understand that you can still be cold with layers on. Also my hands have been known to get ice cold in temperatures below 70°F, especially when I'm stationary, and it's not like wearing gloves is practical for office work. Also my face gets really cold and my nose runs like hell.

Also I don't know what offices you guys have been working in, but almost all of the offices I've seen allow men to take off their suit jacket, and the majority allow short sleeves. Hell, in a lot of programing work environments the dress code seems to be jeans and a t-shirt."
science,ffe822c,t1_ffe3qh5,1579839230.0,"To add to that, a lot of parents who regret having kids are reluctant to tell people that or even admit it to themselves, because they feel like it makes them bad parents or because they're afraid that what they said will somehow get back to their kid and hurt their feelings. You can still love and care about a kid even if you regret having them, but not a lot of people understand that.

To complicate matters further, some may not regret the fact that they had a kid, but they may regret having one *when* they did, whom they had one with, or that they chose to have one with a serious medical or developmental problem that was detected during pregnancy. 

Also before people get on my case, I know that last example sounds cruel, but the reality of the situation is that a lot of parents aren't equipped to deal with a child that will require 24/7 support for the rest of their lives and/or expensive medical intervention, even if they love them. Also the social services that exist to care for them if the parents die before they do are woefully inadequate. Even worse is when they have a sibling and the parents make it that sibling's purpose in life to care for the disabled child."

Don't get me wrong, it's cute and funny, and should definitely be posted all over social media, but I don't think it merits having a story on a very well-known news site.

BrandNewSentence,ff8p9jw,t1_ff8mbxd,1579690093.0,"Your mistake was getting the Twinkies and not the hostess chocolate cupcakes (edit: if you can find any where you live that is). It's not like they're bakery quality, but they're still miles better than Twinkies. 

Something you learn pretty quickly buying supermarket cake in America, is that most cheap white/golden cake (as well as low-quality vanilla frosting) is sickeningly sweet. In rare instances it can be salvaged by having dark chocolate frosting or something more tangy on/in it, but you're generally best off avoiding it unless you get it from a high-quality bakery or restaurant."

news,fd2u6yc,t1_fd243p8,1578151709.0,"It's from the show ""Angel"" (season 2 episode 18). The Wolfram & Hart law firm regularly take evil, and often supernatural, clients. They're later revealed to >!all be working for the Wolf, Ram, and Heart, an ancient cabal of evil demons that they refer to as the ""Senior Partners"".!<

Lindsey (evil hand guy) is frenemies and rivals with the woman there and they were competing for a promotion, and it was implied that who ever didn't get the promotion might be killed. He had previously lost his hand in an incident and had been using a prosthetic until Wolfram & Hart arranged for him to get a hand transplant (aided by magic). This implied that he'll probably get the promotion, since the law firm is spending money on him. At first he's very pleased with his hand, but then realizes that it's writing ""kill"" over and over again on his note pad without his meaning to. Later on in the episode it's revealed that >!Wolfram & Hart is running a facility where body parts are taken from live ""donors"" to be transplanted onto other people. Lindsey finds out his hand came from a former mailroom employee of Wolfram & Hart who went to prison for embezzlement. When he enters the facility he finds the guy begging for someone to kill him, which he does by pulling the plug on his life support.!<

Anyway he's reasonably upset to find out where his hand came from, and came to conclusion that he's had enough of Wolfram & Hart's shit, so this is a scene of him quitting while handing the promotion over to his rival."
