Over $13 million in small-dollar donations from nearly 280,000 suburban women.

There’s no structural social phenomenon where femininity is strictly defined and adhered to by coercive and harmful means, apart from some sociopolitical movements like I pointed out — Terfs, maybe second-wave Feminism.

At its root, toxic masculinity exists as an expression of patriarchy. The social conditions just don’t exist for there to be a feminine equivalent."

Ironically, men who are insulted when people say “toxic masculinity” are more often than not the same folks who go around telling people to stop letting simple words hurt their fragile feelings."
sex,fgs0iex,t1_fgs0cfk,1581065339.0,Thank you for this timely and precise demonstration of the term in question.
sex,fgs04nw,t1_fgrzqan,1581064817.0,"It’s not “targeted” at anyone. You don’t have to be a man to prop up a culture of toxic masculinity just like you don’t have to be white to prop up a system of white supremacy.

It has the word “masculinity” in it because it’s literally about a damaging social ideal to which **men** are pressured to conform by other men, women, and themselves."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fgrzxf6,t1_fgrgl9b,1581064550.0,"The bottom half of Americans have negative net wealth. Even more have less than $400 in the bank.

sex,fgrxqah,t1_fgrwf9x,1581061741.0,"> Toxic masculinity is defined by adherence to traditional male gender roles that restrict the kinds of emotions allowable for boys and men to express, including social expectations that men seek to be dominant (the ""alpha male"") and limit their emotional range primarily to expressions of anger.

It’s not a “stupid term” just because you’ve heard it misused."
sex,fgrxket,t1_fgrc9gr,1581061541.0,People who don’t like the term “toxic masculinity” either don’t like it because they see it in themselves or are under the ignorant impression that it means “masculinity is toxic”.

PropagandaPosters,fggplby,t1_fgg9urk,1580766779.0,Which is what they ended up with. State Capitalism. Marx’s Germany was already heavily industrialized when he was writing. Russia was indeed barely post-feudal so they kind of threw Marxism out the window from the start.
