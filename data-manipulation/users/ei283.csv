madlads,ffb5kgr,t3_eslw0g,1579752382.0,"No one here has the full story written out so I guess I'll do my best; please correct me if needed. I heard this from the tour guide at an MIT visit.

MIT has a tradition of ""hacks"", which is the vernacular for pranks, but usually on a rather large scale. Large banners have been placed over engravings, huge intricate structures have been erected, etc.

Set the scene: it was 1994, and the police were getting a little aggressive with parking tickets recently; these tickets really ticked the students off, and one group wanted revenge.

One morning, the officers received a walkie talkie transmission of distress. Another officer was calling for help; he had been sleeping and woke up on top of the MIT dome, in his car and everything. The officers looked up and sure enough, a police car was up top with what appeared to be someone inside. Helicopters were called in to lower it, and it was seen that a mannequin in uniform was inside the theater prop police car.

After the whole day was spent getting the heavy construction down, the officers were exhausted after a busy day of work. The next morning, the officers were stunned that the entire car had been transported to the dome AGAIN. Once again the helicopters were summoned in and the ""car"" --- which certainly had the weight of a car despite it's true nature --- was lowered again.

The students came out and revealed their scheme. A forgotten tunnel system was discovered inside the MIT dome building; the tunnels were not well documented until these students used them. They revealed that the car was deconstructable and that they brought it through the narrow tunnels piece by piece.

This was a legendary hack, and the police car is now immortalized in the MIT history museum."

mathmemes,fevt93z,t1_feuuro0,1579401193.0,"Calculation is different from definition. How do I calculate 2^i by repeated multiplication? I can't think of any example of e being a significant number on its own. e^x is like the only form where you can find e, so why is e special if you're just gonna raise something to the power of it?

mathmemes,feu64n9,t1_feth8m3,1579383455.0,"Exponentiation is defined by the exponentiation function, exp(x). Exponentiation in the traditional sense of repeated multiplication makes no sense for non integer values, and especially not for imaginary or complex values. The function has many useful properties, like its derivative being itself for any multiple of itself. e is just a number that happens to be the value you get when u plug in 1 for the x in exp(x). e itself is not special.

I didn't make this argument up. I saw it in a 3blue1brown video."

mathmemes,fesqeto,t1_fermw5k,1579367935.0,"I disagree; I think the exponential function (e^x) is far more useful than the number e itself. Writing e to the power of something is still the historical way to write exp(x), and it sticks around because exp looks stupid."
