You’re not manipulative for simply venting and anyone who tries to stop you from simply venting is most likely being quite manipulative themselves. 

Well if you want to talk to me you’re welcome to or I just could just send you funny little pictures and wholesome memes to remind you that I do in fact know you exist. I spent high school not speaking a single word to another human so I know what feeling unloved and isolated feels like (I’m now in uni, but tbh apart from the connections with my family it’s not much better). I know I’m a stranger, so it doesn’t mean much but hey it’s better than being entirely alone.

It makes you feel like a drain on society, an untouchable and it makes you feel like you would be better off gone (I might be off base for you but this is how I felt). I still feel like a drain but it’s gotten easier as things have gone on and I have worked on myself.

I’m not pressuring you though, if you don’t want to talk about it, that’s okay. I get it. I just want to let you know that most of this subreddit has your back and I wish you the best."

Oh well, at least they didn’t go through it."
unpopularopinion,ffik1hb,t1_ffiaqfc,1579975725.0,Also on a side note [there is no correlation between head size and IQ if that’s where you’re planning to go. I know you argue with studies in your post history. This more so for people who might be watching this little conversation right now. It’s not a thing. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/9595970/)

unpopularopinion,ffibk2p,t1_ffiaqfc,1579969957.0,"If you wanted to come up with reason why Chinese culture is bad, you could have come up with a better reason than they eat bugs. 

Westerners eat literally eat bug shit (shellac which is on popular foods such as jelly beans) and insect vomit (honey). We are arguably worse. 

In fact some of us westerners even drink human piss or placenta for the “medical benefits”, so it’s not exactly fair to judge them."

unpopularopinion,ffi7y21,t1_ffi6nps,1579967431.0,"Looking at your post history was alarming and your response even more so. You might need help dude. 

You seem to have a lot of resentment for anyone who isn’t a cishet white dude. That isn’t healthy for anyone involved. 

People from other countries are still people, there is no conspiracy to erase you and there is no need to freak out because some people with a little more melanin in their fleshy outer layer than you, moved next door."
Breath_of_the_Wild,ffi3uet,t3_etpf7g,1579964300.0,"Master mode. Definitely. Once you learn to break the game’s mechanics you really do need the gold enemies around to give you something you can’t kill in 5 seconds. 

Also multiple gems actually give you a decent reason to attack them rather than just shock them for their weapon and run."
