LinusTechTips,fgmsfou,t1_fgmlf73,1580931112.0,"My GPU doesn't get too hot either. Now I do have a rather ""aggressive"" cooling policy on my GPU. The fans on my GPU are pretty silent, though. But after changing fans, I now get a GPU temp of about 65°C max. I also have a very large case. I digress. You should look into it. Best of luck! :)"
LinusTechTips,fglwtwg,t1_fglw4zd,1580912866.0,Well sure. But I personally am more concerned with the cooling efficiency of my fans. I personally don't find them too noisy as in my case they only run at about 50% speed or less. But I can only speak for myself.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fgl7qj4,t3_ey18hm,1580884966.0,This is a prime example of someome who is ideologically possessed. People like that get so caught up in their ideological echo chamber that any little bit of personality they once had is gone.
LinusTechTips,fgl70yv,t1_fgjpr9j,1580884216.0,"I changed the fans on my Corsair H150i to Noctua 3,000RPM fans, and changed my case fans to the 140mm equivalents. Lets me run my i7-9700k at 5GHz with temps usually staying around 65°C at full load. So maybe change your fans? I don't know."
