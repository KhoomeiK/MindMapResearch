I think the other part is that we trick ourselves into thinking that if something is already wrong, it'll take some of the sting away when something else does go wrong."

darksouls,fdchbix,t1_fdcgxe8,1578274895.0,"Well that's shitty. I thought most of the lore fun to be had was discussing and sharing theories none of us know to be true. Ashen's latest video is straight trash, too.

darksouls,fdcbgtk,t1_fdc8ryp,1578270951.0,"Check out Ashen Hollow. The SilverMont has some good shit too.

I like the theory that Seath ended up doing his fucked up tests on Havel's wife/lover based on the ring you find in the archives. That's what caused Havel to snap and decide to kill him. I don't think he was after Gwyn, though. 

Another part of the theory I humor is that Havel still followed the nameless king, and NK wanted Seath gone too for being a traitor."
