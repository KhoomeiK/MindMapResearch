unpopularopinion,ff3i2ow,t1_ff35see,1579541497.0,"So....let me see how I can word this. A dog isn’t going to get a corporation going that wants to drill for oil offshore to make a profit. It’s not going to ignore safety guidelines, or do things cheaply so it can make more money. A dog doesn’t care about stuff like that. Dogs normally want pretty basic things. Food, shelter and safety. Right?  If it has a human owner then the owner provides that, true. But like a dog isn’t going to be going around all day wondering how it can use the materials around it to make money. 

Now humans do that. We look around and try to figure out how to make money. We want the same things a dog does. Food, shelter and safety, but the way we do this is to trade or have the means to get it. We get jobs and we make money. The money comes from doing things that use up raw materials to create other things. Again, using loose terms here, but bear with me. 

Every so often you get one human or a group of humans that thinks something like: “that oil below the ocean floor is valuable. If I get to it first, I will have more money. I will have more things. I will be powerful.” Then they go after it. It doesn’t matter that they are possibly destroying eco systems. Or maybe endangering people, they dig. 

Sometimes there’s a accident and all that oil goes into the ocean. A place where other creatures live. Where other people try to make a living. And it destroys that space and that water. We have to clean it up. But of course there a good people, as you mentioned, who will come and try to help and repair the damage.

But the damage was done because of humans in the first place. Because of their desire for more wealth, power and want for more. 

Human beings destroy a lot. We aren’t all bad, but as I’ve said before, I’ve never seen a dog try and pollute a ocean because it wanted more doggie biscuits."

It’s always something of a shock when a character you’ve played for so long suddenly dies.

I recall a game my group was playing, our Dragonborn paladin died fighting a red dragon, but he was the one who delivered the blow to kill it.

When our party finally recovered the body, my level 19 Druid, who had become good friends with the Paladin was getting ready to perform some crazy ass magic that involves restarting his heart and having him reborn thru magic and the blessing of Nature itself, and our Paladin player stopped me:

“No. He died fighting a enemy and protecting his friends. It’s a honorable death. Just let him rest.”

All seven of the players were incredibly misty eyed and upset, but our DM let us spend the rest of the game creating a tomb worthy of him. My Druid purified the area and made it holy ground, manipulated the way the trees grew to make a protective grove around the tomb. 

It was cathartic, each player creating a thing of beauty using our own skills and finally had a ceremony which was attended by the local eladrin and fae. It still stands out as one of our most emotional sessions."

Anyway, he always had this serious as hell expression and he didn’t talk to anyone, but he was friends with one of my friends, who got him talking about a video game I was playing. We hit it off from there.

Finally I asked him out, I might be introverted, but I’m not exactly good at holding back how I feel about someone. Turns out he had just gotten out of a pretty shitty/abusive relationship with his previous girlfriend. She had cheated on him, and he was feeling a bit raw from that. So he asked to just give him some time, that he didn’t want to jump into a rebound relationship, and it wouldn’t be fair to me.

So I’m patient, I can wait. So I did. We stayed friends for another year, around the time I was starting to give up hope, we finally, FINALLY started dating and got a solid relationship going.
