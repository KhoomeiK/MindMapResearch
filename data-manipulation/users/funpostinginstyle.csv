Sanders doesn't have that good of a record on guns ever. In 1988 he ran for the house on the platform of being in favor of banning semi autos and his GOP opponent PP Smith ran on gun rights. Well in 1989 PP Smith went full fascist cuck and co sponsored a semi auto ban and the NRA went out of their way to kick him out of office, sanders promised to vote against the brady bill (which he honored) and got elected in 1990. Sanders then voted for the 1994 awb and narrowly held his seat in what is the closest election he ever ran in after becoming a congressman but survived by the skin of his teeth.
