GenderCritical,fen973a,t3_eq1h3t,1579279707.0,I work in an all woman environment. It’s nice because we can talk about issues without having to filter. We weather health issues together and support each other through hard times. I’m very fortunate to have spent most of my career surrounded by women and I know it’s had an influence on my opinions.

bipolar,feike2m,t3_ep95ap,1579140569.0,"Already have one. Had her five years before my diagnosis so realistically this isn’t something you can enforce without wading into the eugenics end of the pool.

As for the moral question, should we have children knowing we are passing on sensitive genes? Some people will decide the shouldn’t and that they want to spare any child the pain of this illness. Others decide that their own life is worth living and want to give that opportunity to a child. 

Eliminating bipolar people, autistic people, gay people, on the basis that their suffering is too awful to expose a child to, is paternalistic and dystopian. Life is full of pain no matter what, and joy, too. Whether the pain originates in the mind or the body or the environment we inhabit none of us is immune to it.

GenderCritical,feif28k,t3_ep68kp,1579137018.0,"Disclaimer - I haven’t dated in about 10 years. When I did though I really liked the more feminine men. One boyfriend was prettier than me (and I’m pretty), another taught me to knit, one baked cakes and another used pore strips.

I’ve been pretty feminine since about 16, I just always rocked a pixie cut. I like sensitive, dynamic and intelligent men. 

I haven’t dated for a few reasons and now it’s been so long and I’m so grossed out by dating that I plan on staying celibate. My home is peaceful and cozy and relaxed, introducing a man completely changes the vibe. I like my vibe. :)"
GenderCritical,feidiml,t3_ep9qdc,1579135976.0,"I’ve always supported abortion rights and have never considered having my own abortion. I had a baby at almost 19 and knew immediately I wouldn’t have an abortion.  Because you’re right, it is serious and a bigger deal than woke culture makes it out to be. It’s ending a potential life and that is a serious action to take and one you shouldn’t take lightly. Still, I want an abortion to be performed in a hospital and treated like a serious medical procedure, not a shameful cop out."
