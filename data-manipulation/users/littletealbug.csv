toronto,ff7gwpi,t1_ff7fcts,1579649278.0,"Have you ever shoveled more than a couple stairs in your life bud? It's totally a physical task and there are plenty of people who are seniors or experience some level of disability who can't do it. Yes, sure, most people can clear a couple steps and a little path to their car. But if a property needs a full driveway cleared (for the foundations/garage access/whatever), full sidewalks, or for multiple entrances there are lots of people who just can't, People typically outsource moving from property to property - it has nothing to do with the safety of the current property. Ice is a major safety issue and the mail delivery/utilities/other tenants need it to be safe regardless. 

And the LL IS responsible for most other safety related maintenance - fire alarms, structural issues, stairs. 

Believe me, I do this for a literal living, I have shoveled 100's of different residential properties and plenty of them I know for a fact the people that live there cannot do it.  Plenty of them are rental properties with multiple units that it is just easier and safer for all tenants if the landlord takes on the financial responsibility of making sure the property is clear. Liability is no joke."
toronto,ff7eoyx,t1_ff6mtwk,1579647818.0,"The problem is that is a physical task not everyone can keep up with and if you get it done it's a safety hazard.  If I owned a property of my own and I couldn't do it I'd mitigate that physicality with a snow blower or calling a company, but if I only live there a few seasons why would I invest that kind of money? In my personal case I do all the snow shoveling - but I also do it for a living so my own place gets neglected until the end. The other tenant here is a low income senior and if I can't dig her car out after a storm she is trapped. 

I don't need my landlords to take full responsibility but some help would be nice, and since they are on the neglectful/disinterested side they won't do so until they legally have to."

antiwork,fek2vw3,t1_fejzj8z,1579191452.0,"If it's a human construct we apply to ourselves than aren't we kinda obligated to apply it to what we do to animals? I agree it doesn't apply to what animals do to animal, but I'd say there is some concept of consent and non-consent anyways, it's just that our morals and taboos don't apply and it's not like wild animals are punished for what's in their nature to do - consent or not.

antiwork,fejzuk8,t1_fejymep,1579189580.0,"I mean, if you've ever been near a cow (and I say this as a person who has actually worked with cows) the answer to that is actually yes, to some extent. If a cow doesn't want you near it, it's calves or it's herd, you'll know and you won't like it. They are far more intelligent and social than they get credit for. 

But the real answer is that's kind of why we have to talk about how we treat animals? They can't really give informed consent, so we (the people who are responsible for their well being) need to understand as best we can the extent of how  something will harm them and mitigate that harm. That's kind of what's lost in factory farming, those people don't give a shit about the suffering of the animals they keep and that needs to change.

The industry has a massive problem with employee retention. Low wages are standard and small businesses struggle to fix this because they   have so many points in the season with no work or dramatically reduced income. My idea for a co-op would be various types of seasonal businesses and contractors supporting each other by sharing workers during down times and contributing to a large scale benefits plan that small businesses typically cannot afford. Also the sharing of local products and resources as well. 

Ie local arborist has a supply of branches a garden center can take and make arrangements with at lower cost. Garden centre closes in winter but workers have option to work in a greenhouse or snow removal company within the co-op. Ideally workers in the co-op would make a yearly salary rather than hourly. Most seasonal workers are used to shuffling around like this through the year anyways, but the co-op would hopefully offer a stable living wage unaffected by weather. 

This could extend to clients as well in some fashion, co-op members having access to all manner of services involved in the co-op at affordable rates, and with cohesive ideals."
