nyjets,ffdom73,t3_estrxy,1579825319.0,"I’m gonna take the minority position and say hell yeah I would do this trade.

We have an excellent Rb but one that is not wanted or used in our coaches offense. Love him or hate him Gase is in control of the team and if he thinks he can succeed with a guy they draft in the 5th round, why would we hold onto Bell? Force a square peg into a round hole?

Why is anyone worried about paying Trent? We’re paying out the ass for a Rb we don’t use properly and our coach has no intention of using properly. I’d rather get Trent and pay him than dump Leveon for a 4th round pick or something stupid that likely won’t amount to anything too special. 

If we can get a franchise LT out of this, do it. I don’t believe Trent is even close to being done. If we can get another two years or so of top notch play and then he slowly declines, I’m cool with that. Get Sam elite level protection. Make this trade and then you have the freedom to use the #11 pick on Jeudy or Lamb.

Not including anything above a 5th in this deal though. A third going to Washington with Bell is outrageous."

Growing up we had a chocolate lab that was literally like a superhero to me. She would take periodic tours of the house at night to make sure we were all safe. I would always get upset if she didn’t end up sleeping at the foot of my bed because there would be nothing that made me feel more safe and secure, so naturally I’d fall asleep much faster.

Eventually she would make the adjustment and sleep in my room. As long as she was there with me, I literally feared nothing. No thunderstorm, ghost or burglar would harm me as long as I had her....

I think I was 14 when I had to go in and put her to sleep. It was worse than experiencing the death of any human in my life up until that point. I miss her still and still hold her up as the model I hope the next dog I’m able to get will be like for my family and my children."

Also, if this is truly your passion and you believe it’s a field you’ll find happiness in, screw what people are telling you. Have other people found jobs in that field? Yes. So why can’t you? It might come down to how much you’re willing to put into it to get into the field, but that’s on you and how bad you want it.

Worst case is that you don’t find a job in that field but are still rocking a bachelors degree on your resume which is universally accepted as better than not having it in your resume."

My only regret is that I did it at a big fancy and expensive school. I don’t think anyone understands how to notch the school I attended is/was, so it basically rendered it useless. Unless it’s Ivy League, nobody cares where you went as long as it’s accredited.

But getting back to the main point, you should go look around at job postings for managers or supervisors in pretty much any general field.
