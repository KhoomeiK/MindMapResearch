Did you think we came out of the womb brandishing pencils and paint while conjuring masterpieces or singing your favorite song? Artists of all kinds spend countless hours practicing their skills, often giving up a lot of free time, fun, sleep and more to get to a certain level, that’s what makes the difference. 

I’ve always said talent nourishes your passion, but it’s not some sort of magical power that automatically makes you good at something. We fail more than we succeed, we just show the things we deem good enough to the world."

I was home alone (although one of my cousins joined me later) with my dog and luckily for me, that mutt was the sole reason the creep didn’t come inside my actual house and do...whatever he planned, but he did climb over to my neighbors home and broke inside; took off with a bunch of her stuff as well.

We have the whole thing in camera. The moment he jumped in, the moment my dog chased him away, the moment he broke into my neighbor’s house and him leaving with her shit. Police was called, showed up late and then told us there was nothing they could do.

A week or so later, neighbor and us pooled some money to have flyers made with the creeps pic to warn others of him (as the neighborhood had had other break-ins and now suspected him). Police came and told us to take them down because we were “inciting violence”. We refused, but they sure did take their sweet time to supervise while they forced us to take them down.

TwoXChromosomes,feff5ei,t1_fefdcyl,1579055014.0,"I get what you're saying, but the reverse is also true. I mean pretty in that I don't like having unibrows, messy hair or a wild bush because I like feeling and looking well groomed, yet, I'm a more than a bit of a hermit, so it's most definitely for myself. It is also not unuslual for women where I live to not care about hair since most are quite hairy to begin with and it turns out to be a hassle to take care of it. 

I've never liked the way hair looks or feels in women and men; I've even tried going without shaving for a good while myself, but it only made me feel uncomfortable all over my body; itchy, prickly, more sweaty, smelly, and what not.

Interesting point about social expectations. I can count the times I've worn make up with one hand in all my 30 years, so if expectations were a factor on my decision, then I'd also be all over makeup and conventionally pretty & feminine clothing as well."

I'm also not sure I'd include her in the rap line, she is a supporting-vocalist (along with Vivi) which I think is different from a  sub-vocalist (Choerry), a lead (Jinsoul) and a main (Chuu).
