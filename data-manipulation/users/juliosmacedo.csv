AskMen,fen50js,t3_epyrad,1579277106.0,"I think this ""the one"" thing is not a one-shot thing, but actually an idea that slowly grows on the couple's mind. Everything people said already is valid, like being yourself, honesty and good communication. Over time, if expectations are not big or both are not ""running against the biological clock"" type of thing, this feeling of ""the one"" will come. Is not like passion at first sight. It will go around a lot of unconscious and conscious ""test"" phases from both until you both be able to say that out loud.

Also, peer pressure is shit. Probably couples around you are getting married, having babies and turning the side to another part of life. This happens to me but oddly I feel like I don't belong at all on a setting like that, and maybe makes me easier to find a like-minded person. My problem is actually not realizing ""the one"" was right beside me until we grown apart. This happens more than once, so chances are that maybe there are a lot of ""the ones"" out there as well!"

ShittyLifeProTips,fda4z5r,t3_ekcqx6,1578241746.0,"I don't drink in years. Never liked it and stopped almost suddenly, after college. I mostly drank socially but as I grew older alcohol started not being welcome by my body.

When I say I don't drink, people almost immediately ask ""why?"", expecting some sort of crazy car crash or domestic violence story. In their minds, only something really extraordinary would make someone to stop drinking. The reality is that I was just tired of hangover: spending one whole day to recover from a single night does not make sense in my pragmatic mind.

IMO, ""gave up drinking"" feels like there is some sort of backstory, but in the end there is not (in my case). I just don't like the taste, the feel, the price and everything else. 

Also, being forced to drink and allowing something like this only by peer pressure is very wrong. You should be able to speak freely and stand your ground amongst these so called ""friends"" that want to force something into you that you don't want.
In other words, be yourself."
