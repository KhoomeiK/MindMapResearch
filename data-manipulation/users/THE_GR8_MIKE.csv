MarioKartTour,ffxqtae,t3_evixiy,1580330594.0,There's never been a better time to cancel gold pass than last tour.
NintendoSwitch,ffw2tmm,t1_ffvgr72,1580281897.0,They're like trophies. Except worse.
NintendoSwitch,ffv4fmg,t1_fftz8q2,1580255432.0,Just shows you how bad it really is. Mobile games ruined gaming by introducing garbage mechanics. What a surprise.
PokemonQuest,ffudjc7,t3_ev35nr,1580239693.0,"Bulk up Machop, hydro pump Starmies. And hit healing. A lot of that."

xboxone,ffucgpy,t1_ffte2y1,1580239059.0,"Any sort of lootbox system should be left in the garbage mobile game it came from. They've never been more fun than a traditional unlock system and provide *much* less of an incentive to keep playing. Random unlocks and scrap systems have been, are, and will forever be complete shit."

technology,ffrpfnj,t3_eupz3c,1580162900.0,5G is like the Google Stadia. It looks good on paper and sounds good but in actuality no one gives a shit about it.

NintendoSwitch,ffrfrdq,t3_eum8xb,1580157202.0,PowerA makes some *really* small controllers. Spawn Wave on YouTube has done videos on a bunch of them.

forza,ffnbwud,t1_ffju411,1580064145.0,Flat screens make a lot of games look worse. Blurring on CRT TVs made them look better.

NintendoSwitch,ffgqqpk,t1_ffg97n8,1579912658.0,Right. And new joycons sold still have the original model stick. They're replacing them with the same old one.
cars,fffyn6a,t3_etb0tl,1579894667.0,Like how the Cherokee is the most sold SRT vehicle by far. It's not surprising.

baseball,fffrgve,t3_etco3k,1579890198.0,Mods should get rid of that other thread. That one has way more attention than this one.
