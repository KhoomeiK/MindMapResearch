Aside from that, one of the goals of moving away from xray was because it was *mildly*  dangerous. Why would they spend millions of dollars replacing xray with something even more dangerous?

AskReddit,ffeaeti,t1_ffe9hi2,1579841196.0,"I see social democracy as a necessary step. Its been proven affective and allows the people more power to resist oppressors. Really, I dislike the existance of a capitalist class owning the means of production. I deeply believe in the labor theory of value, meaning someone should be paid based on the work they put in, as opposed to a capitalist owning homes and collecting rent from them without actively contributing any value, as an example. Collective bargaining is made easier through social democracy, lifting some of the chains workers are held down by (such as work place supplied healthcare).  I also have a hard time believing that greed is an innevitable human trait, but that is a hard thing to reason over. I believe the only way communism can exist without the threat of dictatorial leadership is through direct democracy, but that has never been attempted on a large scale, so who's to say if it would work. Given all of these uncertainties, I am content with a social democracy."
AskReddit,ffe95ud,t1_ffe8h6h,1579840133.0,"End in a complete shitshow? Depends. Vietnam, from the information Ive gathered, did ok for a while under communism before slowly falling into whatever the hell you classify it as now. Spain, during their civil war, had a relatively small group of anarchists that were successful enough until eventually being trampled on by a MUCH larger army. Chile couldve had something going for it with Allende if that wasnt immediately stomped out by US intervention. And yugoslavia did great until Tito died. The trouble with this is that large scale communism has so far always devolved into a shit show, and smaller scale communism was annihilated by much larger powers that got triggered about communism. I am absolutely confident that communism works on small scales, but history, unfortunately, has yet to give evidence of it being effective on larger scales."

While I disagree, strongly, with the issues of capitalism, and hence with liberalism as well, I despise open support and/or denial of genocide.

todayilearned,fehmnna,t1_fefpel6,1579119639.0,"Nihilism is useful in that if offers a framework of understanding. To understand that there is no meaning is equal to freeing you from the bonds of a more restrictive belief. It offers a new scope from which to view the world without barring anything off. This on its own is not so useful, but the expansions, both to optimistic nihilism and cosmic existentialism, as well as the moral beliefs that may come with them, very much do affect the real world and how people act.


Now, I dont disagree that there can be non outwardly  impactful philosophies. ""The egg"" for example while building a view of reality suggests no specific way to live or act. It won't necessarily impact peoples' actions; atleast, it won't without some expansion to the idea. That doesn't mean it's useless though. It's an idea, and ideas may as well be a person's reality, and to change someone's reality is rather impactful. Whether they outwardly change as a result of this idea is inconsequential."
