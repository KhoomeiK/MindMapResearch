I admit now there is a difference in the term ""authored,"" which I presume to be bills he wrote and or helped write (co-authored), as opposed to ""sponsored.""  I could find that he authored three bills.  Two about post offices, and one about veterans compensation.

However, it was my understanding sponsored simply meant he supported them, etc.  on their submittal.  It seems that sponsored actually means that bill, even if he didn't author it, was submitted by him to congress for a vote.

Under that criteria, it seems he has put forth a few thousands of bills for a vote, not simply he supported those bills when they were submitted.

I realize that to denigrate him for not authoring that many bills is disingenuous (even over a 40 year career), as most bills are written by others or groups of others, then submitted by congresspeople for a vote in the House or Senate.  He has sponsored many bills, meaning he brought them to a vote in either the House or Senate, which he served in both.

JoeRogan,ffis20w,t1_ffiqmad,1579981285.0,"From experience in the US, I know people have opportunity and the ability to support themselves and lead a meaningful life.  In the US there is a huge movement and motivation to redistribute wealth and I think that is bad.  I think it makes everyone poorer, and the only people who keep their lifestyles and security are the rich.  Everyone else gets poorer as the economy contracts, the pie gets smaller, and particularly the smaller slices of pie get much smaller.  The answer is not to just take more and more money from the seemingly inexhaustible resources of the rich, and throw it at the poor thinking this will surely get them out of poverty and living sustainable lives.  We have been doing that in the US since the 60s.  It has only served to institutionalize poverty and keep people dependent.

That attitude plays into our health care system.  You would not believe the amount of money being written off by hospitals from unpaid bills.   Prices are sky rocketing in part because of the huge amount of people who take up a lot of care and time because they don't take care of themselves, and then they don't pay their bills.  I know I have heard about this in the UK a little.  Those people are part of the victimhood society of a blank moral balance sheet.  That everything in their lives is a result of evil rich people and they have no ownership for their personal choices.  I have had multiple family members who worked in scheduling and accounts receivable at medical care facilities.

Let me clear a fallacy up for you that people are turned away at hospitals.  They are not.  That is why Michelle Obama was involved in a bussing scandal in Chicago where poor people were put on busses and shipped to other hospitals miles away so they didn't have to provide care for them.  Michelle didn't want her hospital to be the one writing off all that money.

The EU?  Britain was enjoying an economic recovery during the 80s after failed socialist policies of the 70s.  I am not a huge student of Brittanic history, and I realize that Thatcher was a controversial figure, but I don't think it is deniable that most Britons had their incomes rise in the mid 80s after a long period of economic stagnation.  Part of that was emulating the same kind of policies that were pulling the US out of an era where they had to make up a new measurement to quantify how bad things were: the Misery Index."

For example, people go on about banana republics and Latin America and ignore that what was going on was par for the course in those areas.  It wasn't something the US brought.

You look like a fool writing a few hundred words trying to say the condition of how around 99% of people born in the US enjoy is privileged.

It is not how you meant it, and you look stupid trying to act like it is."

So, what makes you so much better than everyone else that you can have the promise of a high paying job, presumably doing what you want to do, and others don't have the simple ability to support themselves?  That sounds awfully elitist.  I think everyone has that ability and encouraging them to stay dependent on the government while you are so much smarter sounds pretty classist.

I see you don't really know anything about those rankings or can give any real details about them.  The most recent rankings I see now have the US 24th, yet as I said, when the rich get sick throughout the world, they don't go to Iceland.  They go to Mayo Clinic or John Hopkins.

The UK is also ranked higher than the US, and you don't deny people are dying on waiting list.  But is because of evil rich greedy people who want to keep some of their money, presumably while funding the lion's share of tax revenue.  You know what?  It is never enough.  I know a little about the UK, not much.  I do know that the country was in an absolutely abysmal state overall until Thatcher and her government took control in the 1980s and the country took a turn for the better overall.  Go ahead and cite some details or sob stories, but it is undeniable the country was in decline and suddenly changed direction and improved when policies changed to those that were turning the US around in the same time period."

No, you are liar.  You did not mean I am privileged because I was born with all four limbs ten figures and ten toes.  You sound pathetic trying to walk it back now.

Just like you didn't mean it as a compliment when called me slime, I am dishonorable, or hiding some post history."
JoeRogan,ffihdy8,t1_ffigrma,1579973918.0,"Have you read some of those rankings?  Have you?  Or do you just take them as gospel? I know that Saudi Arabia was ranked higher than the US on health care.  Yet I also know that kings in the Middle East come to the US in order to get their health care because it is the best in the world.  I know my cousin, who is of Saudi descent, has to fly back to the Middle East to practice medicine because he can't pass his boards in the US.

You see, you are really uninformed and unaware that those rankings are heavily biased in favor of people who have socialized medicine, while your own former NIH director died on a waiting list in the UK for a procedure he would have gotten immediately.  You must also be unaware that in Canada, wealthy Canadians don't wait for months like middle classed Canadians, they come to the US to get the same procedure everyone else in the US gets right away.

I am not a rich man because I spent half my life believing stuff like you seem to believe: the system is rigged and hopeless and there is no chance in trying to be successful.  If I had done what I was supposed to be doing and been making good decisions my whole life, I'd be much better off.  Still, I am supporting myself and providing for my family and I while living comfortably.  That is how much opportunity there is in the United States."
JoeRogan,ffigvun,t1_ffigi90,1579973578.0,"Really?  Because I see you flip flopping and failing between morale, measured, and cultured intellectual and hurling insults like slime and insinuating I have some dark deep secret hiding in my post history.

JoeRogan,ffifvwo,t1_ffif7ix,1579972896.0,"Umm, no.  They don't.  I see this again and again.  I've lived with these people for much of my life.  People in bad situations typically are there because of the decisions they make.  Most of my life has been in prisons, homeless, working low paying jobs and living in bad areas.  I am very well acquainted with them.

Again, the only time I got lucky is when I changed my lifestyle and behavior instead of blaming it on a rigged and unfair system.  Other people I knew who changed their behavior similarly suddenly got ""lucky.""  The people who didn't change have never gotten ""lucky."""

No.  Don't act like you weren't trying to dismiss my opinions by accusing me of living a privileged and cushy life, where everything has just fallen into my open hands.  And don't act like that is how you view anyone who refutes the idea of a systematically unfair and hopeless society."
JoeRogan,ffiewxz,t1_ffiefef,1579972231.0,"I do believe that people sometimes have bad things happen in their life and genuinely are blameless for their misfortune.  That is a very small minority to the amount of people who are claiming their lot in life is because of an evil, systematically unfair system.

Over and over I see this in life.  My wife is in a roller derby club and a lot of the women there have this idea of victimhood.  Lately, all the local organizations they deal with have been calling her and saying they want to make her the main point of contact.  Why?  Because the other women don't call people back, they act unprofessionally, and they don't follow through with what they said they would.  Meanwhle the women are convinced everything bad in their life has nothing to do with their own choices.  My whole life I've seen people act like this, while others make good decisions, act responsibly, and can support themselves instead of crying about how the rich aren't giving them money.

Lots of people break bones in the US also.  I know we drink a lot of milk in the US, but people break bones here.  I've broken a bone.  My family didn't go bankrupt.  I'm not rich."

JoeRogan,fficemp,t1_ffic33w,1579970534.0,"Really, because, again, you were the one who started making insinuations and accusations and call names.

This is a theme with people who think like you.  You act all intellectual and smart and erudite, then as soon as you can't defend yourself anymore it is insults and juvenile attacks like, ""well I looked through your post history.""  And of course, you are speechless in regards to what exactly you found.

Reading through your post history I see you have a penchant for racism.  I'm not going to prove it to you in the say way I won't prove to a pedophile that he's a pedophile.
