relationship_advice,fexvm7e,t3_eqvm6y,1579437172.0,"It's a two way street. You have to work to keep her, but she has to work to keep you too. You both have to put effort into the relationship. If she isn't willing, the no point."
depression,fem69w0,t1_fejkqck,1579241250.0,"Probably not. My mum didn't, until I threatened suicide.

But, at least she knows.

Can you go to the Dr's yourself? Maybe they have a way that they can help you, get you some help.."
depression,fehx0e7,t3_ep93yw,1579125544.0,"Honestly? Kids are ass holes. They really are. I was teased all throughout primary school and high school. It's bullshit. But it happened.

Have you talked to your mum? Told that you need help? Told her what your going through?"
relationship_advice,fehwn5w,t3_ep941c,1579125335.0,"When you see him, talk to him about it. I don't think your a back up plan. It may be the fact that because of how you guys ended, he may still have feelings for you and want to see if it will go any where and work it out.

Just be willing to be 100% open with him, and be willing to get hurt by some of what he says. I don't mean forever, just while working this out."
relationship_advice,fefs062,t3_eoxiby,1579063474.0,"Instead of fighting if it's not something you want to do, walk up to her and put your arm around her, whether from the side or back. Kiss her on the cheek, temple, even lips, infront of these people, make sure they know that you are with her. It will also make her feel better knowing you are there.

Don't go too over the top possessive, unless both you and her want that, but just enough that others know you are together and she isn't single. Sometimes a ring means nothing to people unless there is a clear show of affection from both of you."

offmychest,fefrm3m,t1_fed80t7,1579063166.0,"I get that. I hate that ultimatum as well. And it doesn't necessarily have to be that ultimatum, but he needs to realize that it's effecting you to this degree and make changes. He needs to set boundaries. Preferably about 3 years ago.

He is in a way encouraging the behavior as he is continuing to answer her and let her get everything. And it's not okay.

My mum went through this in a way with my step dad and his mum, and it took my mum taking me and his newborn daughter away for a few days for him to realize what he was going to lose.

It's a really hard thing but for a healthy relationship it has to happen. She will not get better or change if he is bowing to her every whim."
offmychest,fed7prb,t3_eok7cg,1579002738.0,"Tell him. Sit him down and tell him. Because that is honestly horrific and I don't know how you have felt with it for 3 years. I wouldn't have been able to handle it for 3 months.

You need to tell him that either he does something about it, now, or you are done. It is not fair on you to suffer through that at all, ever.

I am so sorry..."

dating,fdouvog,t3_emi5xh,1578613410.0,"Honestly it sounds like verbal/mental/emotional abuse. You need to get out. He needs to see a therapist and honestly I think you might too.

I know it feels like he is the one, but it sounds very unhealthy. I think you will be a lot happier once your out. It will take some time, but you will be better off without him."
relationship_advice,fd1zphv,t3_ejvtwd,1578139353.0,"I would try talking to her again. Explain that you love her and that you are happy with her, but you just want to try new things. And if it doesn't work, maybe see a therapist about it all?"
relationship_advice,fcw9dde,t3_ej8ydw,1578020152.0,"If your breaking up with him, does it matter? Go and enjoy your time. Ignore him."
offmychest,fcw96t1,t3_ej8yny,1578020032.0,Can you ask her to leave? Because that is not okay at all. I am sorry.
SuicideWatch,fcw9056,t3_ej8yw4,1578019907.0,"Delete your account. Even for a little while. Or make a whole new one. Start completely fresh with it.

Relationships end, as hard as it is, it happens.

I really hope your okay. You can message if you need too."
relationship_advice,fctw0db,t1_fctskku,1577962402.0,"I would start out slow, say that you guys have started chatting, let them get used to that idea first. And then after a little time, tell them you guys have been dating. I wouldn't leave it too much longer though, other wise it may make the entire situation worse when you do eventually tell them."
relationship_advice,fcti6ot,t1_fcsiwmf,1577944111.0,I think it is a risk you may have to take. How long did you guys talk for before you started dating? Did they know you were talking to him??
relationship_advice,fcshx1d,t3_eiomha,1577916837.0,Can I ask how old you and this person are?
relationship_advice,fcpanr7,t3_eie2hq,1577856342.0,"Not acceptable at all. Not even a little. She made a commitment to spend the day with your family, I get wanting to go out drinking with friends, but she could have caught up with them after or another day. She made the commitment , own it."
relationship_advice,fcp7pek,t3_eidyby,1577853246.0,Honestly? Brake up with him. He clearly doesn't care about you and that's not okay. I know you don't want to but that's just not okay. I'm really sorry.
depression,fcm1fqu,t3_ehwogk,1577761739.0,Have you tried hypnotherapy?
relationship_advice,fcm145a,t3_ehwp86,1577761496.0,"Do you talk about things to do with both of you or just her? If it's only her then yeah, I'd be talking to her, but it's if both of you chatting about everything and anything, then she genuinely wants to talk to you. And she is calling you before anyone else so she clearly wants to talk to you."
offmychest,fcm0we0,t3_ehwpfw,1577761336.0,"I'm 25, no nothing about taxes, super or anything like that. Your not alone. The school system really failed."
offmychest,fcm0p24,t3_ehwptg,1577761187.0,"Honestly you sound pretty cute. And for a chick who just scraps 5'1, you sound the perfect height (says the chick who is getting into a relationship with someone who is 6'1). Personally I think you'll be fine."
offmychest,fcm0ia0,t3_ehsz00,1577761049.0,That's amazing! So proud of you ❤️❤️
offmychest,fckgcr1,t3_ehobx5,1577724714.0,Get her and those kids the hell out of there! Nope. Do not feel bad or guilty. Get the kids out of there.
relationship_advice,fckg3a4,t3_ehocbg,1577724545.0,Run. Get out. Run.
offmychest,fck1v80,t1_fcjwdvu,1577714046.0,Yeah I know. I am overly cautious about anyone and everyone that comes into my life now. But I am very slowly learning to trust again.
depression,fcjvh58,t1_fcju1ly,1577706725.0,Thank you.
offmychest,fcjvgqo,t1_fcjuaov,1577706709.0,"Yeah I know. That's why I got out, long before I broke down crying. Like, years before."
depression,fcjtdcn,t1_fcjshs7,1577703727.0,"No, he found someone else and now has his second child on the way. We did keep in contact for a little while but fell out of touch, he is happy with his new partner. He took it well, he knew i wasn't okay. Neither of us really wanted it to end, but we knew it was for the best."
offmychest,fcjr2mh,t1_fcjptnu,1577700357.0,"Because I was 17ish and stupid. unless you are in the situation you have no idea what it like. 

He was a friend because he was an amazing guy, him being a drug dealer was just an added bonus in this situation. 

Again, I repeat, unless you have been in this situation, you don't know."

offmychest,fcjkj9k,t3_ehiw4l,1577691325.0,"You should leave her. If you feel like you will do it again, leave. Don't stay. she doesn't deserve it, as you said. So, leave."
offmychest,fcjka9k,t1_fcjchu6,1577691014.0,"Of course. If you need, PM me. More than happy to chat."
relationship_advice,fcjjomu,t3_ehitpk,1577690277.0,"Yes. He should never have re added her. 100% is it okay. And if he complains or says anything, remind him he cheated with this girl and it is NOT OKAY."
books,fcjizlh,t1_fcjbx6q,1577689439.0,"They are a slow build, but they are amazing the way the characters grow an change. How they learn and adapt. They also came to me when i was going through a lot, so there are a few books that hold a special place.

No, what is Red Rising? Its Greek mythology. I had to change it slightly though."
relationship_advice,fcjiu6r,t1_fcj9kvm,1577689267.0,"Are you thinking of actually breaking up with him, or just what it would be like if you did?"
offmychest,fcjir1k,t1_fcjbzs5,1577689168.0,"That's great that he is like that, that he understands. Probably helps that you were 100% honest with him about it all. 

It sounds like he has a lot he needs to figure out. It sounds like he needs to work out if he actually really cares and loves this woman. If he did, while he ma want to keep you in his life, he would make a way to work around it and compromise. E.g. Talk you once a month for a couple hours instead of all the time, let her be included in catch ups, those type of things. Personally I think you should say goodbye and stop replying, even if its only for a few days, then send a general catch up message, once a week or once a month, and just not reply to his messages all the time. Or, as harsh as this sounds. Completely stop, even for a few weeks, just no replies at all. 

I get he is in a bad place, but he really needs to work out if he wants to make it work with this woman or not."
relationship_advice,fcj8x1r,t3_ehh0x6,1577680221.0,It is normal. Especially for long term relationships. Where you have come to depend on each other as much as you have. Wondering what it would be like if that goes away and how you would handle it all. It is more common than people think.
offmychest,fcj77r0,t1_fcj5lye,1577678989.0,What does your husband think of your friendship? That fact that he hasn't told his fiancé is telling to me. It tells me he know she would hate it and make him stop talking to you. It think you too really need to gain closure somehow.
books,fciwe0c,t3_eh9ze6,1577671411.0,"Eragon, the Inheritance cycle. They are Amazing books, I have read them that many time the covers are falling off and chances are I'll be rereading them again soon, the ending though, kills me. I am great full that  Christopher Paolini Brought out the Fork, the Witch and the Worm that gave some much needed answers. But even then, that was a 7 year wait."
books,fcitc8g,t3_eei8mb,1577669324.0,"Clockwork Angel by Cassandra Clare

While I have read these books before, I am going back and reading them in chronological order. I absolutely love this series and can't wait to finish them all, again."
books,fciszll,t1_fcbrbhc,1577669085.0,Have you read her A Court of Thorns and Roses? Those are amazing. I couldn't put them down.
books,fcismy5,t1_fcfxuf1,1577668851.0,"Hide, by Lisa Gardner"
books,fcisk58,t1_fcgtiau,1577668800.0,"Have you heard of the Dark Heavens trilogy by Kylie Chan? There is 3 separate trilogies that go along with the series, they are to do with the Chinese mythology, Gods and Demons. They are written in a similar way to Percy Jackson but aimed at an older audience. They are amazing, I own all 9 and plan on re-reading them AGAIN soon."
socialskills,fcirtiq,t3_ehelux,1577668310.0,"I was like this for years, except all my friends lived within 30 minutes of me and I still only saw them a couple time a year, I just didn't have the energy to mental functions to be able to go see them thank to severe depression. So, when I felt like I needed some form of human interaction that wasn't too full on, I would take a book and go out to lunch or dinner by myself, have a little chat with the wait staff watch the world around me, and read while I ate. It was and is surprisingly refreshing."
offmychest,fciqilc,t1_fcgoetz,1577667418.0,"Honestly, it feels like neither of you have fully moved on and that is something that has to happen for you both to be happy with your partners. You either need to have a serious talk with him and work out how to move on, or just stop talking to each other even if it's only for a while. It will be very hard at first but in order for you both to be happy with your partners, you need to do it. It's not fair to them or your selves."
offmychest,fcel7sa,t1_fcdm5et,1577621503.0,"For me it was the fact that a small part of me thought that I would end up with him at some point again, even though I ended it with him, it wasn't because I didn't love him, it was because I was mentally unwell and just kept using him as a crotch and didn't get better. Standing on my own two feet made me have to get better, knowing he wouldn't be there to make things better.

The thought of it didn't really fully disappear until I found out his Missus was pregnant with their second child. I realized that there was no way we would end up together.

How often do you guys talk now? Talking once or twice a year as a general catch up is fine, but constantly keeping in contact with each other is not healthy. And depending on just what you are feeling, you may just want to completely cut contact all together."
offmychest,fcdjs4r,t1_fcdhfrj,1577610623.0,"Honestly, no you don't. But I do get it. I had no right to be heart broken when my ex had a kid with someone else after 2 years but I was. Feelings don't exactly follow being right or wrong, they just are. It's going to suck for a while. I think the best thing you can do is completely move on and I think the only way you can do that is to stop talking to him completely."
SuicideWatch,fcdiil7,t3_eh3lf9,1577610311.0,"I am so sorry. My grandfather is like my dad and I couldn't imagine losing him. I am so sorry your going through this, alone as well. If you want to talk, feel free to pm me."
