offmychest,ffi00s6,t1_ffhzf1n,1579960861.0,This is gonna sound really immature but I’m terrified of that. You gave me the exact advice I needed yet I stand here terrified to confront him
Sims4,ffhzeff,t1_ffhzcvp,1579960239.0,Thank you! I love the natural lighting in this game especially with seasons! Takes a way from the dry gameplay a bit haha
Sims4,ffhz70u,t1_ffhyrva,1579960029.0,"The only piece of CC is the dresser part of the dresser mirror but the rest is all from packs. I only have Seasons, Parenthood, Laundry Day and City living. The bed I think is laundry day and the mirror is city living, everything else in the photo I believe is base game!"
AstrologyChartShare,ffg202l,t1_ffg1l0b,1579896735.0,Thanks for the insight! It definitely seems like one of those push pull vibes between them but because both are with other people I doubt anything will happen. The tension is crazy though!

astrology,fffyx72,t1_fffxazu,1579894837.0,See that’s a toughie because I feel a lot of both Scorpio and Capricorn (my sun and moon sign) so I guess maybe both? I have equal planets in each

CPTSD,fffgbgp,t3_et98yp,1579883338.0,"I think while most people go through some sort of trauma in their lives, how you're affected by it depends on the other factors going on in your life such as do you have a good support system or role models, at least that's how my EMDR therapist put it. For me, I might have been able to get through the childhood medical trauma had I not also been being hit with Toxic Family System trauma..."
Sims4,fffewcd,t1_fffenhv,1579882458.0,"I found it in a set collection from TSR. The mirror is with City Living, its originally a floor mirror but I used cntrl+9 to raise it to appear as if its a dresser/mirror! (Technically the ""dresser"" part isnt a dresser but a sideboard, I think it looks cool though and since the mirror is fully functional for changing outfits it works!)"

truechildfree,fff2xvp,t3_et4b7x,1579874275.0,"I'm forced to believe the government actually supports children being born into unstable and unprepared homes so they can become property of the state. Call me a conspiracy theorist but why else would some states be basically banning abortion while on the same hand wanting to restrict access to birth control, contraceptives and sterilzation to our young people?"

dystopia,ffc6nzv,t1_ffc4s1a,1579792776.0,"I'd say losing personal freedoms and slowly turning into a police state is dystopian. Not saying that it's 100% gonna happen, but people are slowly becoming more and more intolerant of differing opinions. It's not just ""liberals"" either, Honestly the seperate party systems are a huge part of the problem. They only serve to divide us."
thesims4,ffa6btq,t1_ffa4s2f,1579728735.0,She was my second generation in this legacy and was the main one I was playing with so I'm kinda sad but I'll just go play her brothers family now..

ShitLiberalsSay,ff9yksa,t3_esdhy3,1579724283.0,"It's a story because they are comparing it to the obscene amounts of trash at other rallys. Just because we disagree doesn't mean we get to be mad they exercised a right they have in this country.

Edit: Downvoters answer me this, do you think if freedom of speech is taken away from people you disagree with, your right to speech won't also be eradicated?"

Vasectomy,ff9x73n,t1_ff22uir,1579723458.0,"Did she not know you were getting it done? Seems like she should understand why you can’t help. After all, you are relieving her from ever having to go through child birth and pregnancy again, the least she can do is let you rest"
truechildfree,ff9wy9f,t3_esfaby,1579723307.0,Thanks for the help! I’ll check out those pages... glad to hear you are pain free at the moment! Enjoy it while it last
truechildfree,ff9svy9,t3_esfaby,1579720529.0,How bad is your pain? I know pain is subjective but my husbands is scheduled for the 7th and he is very nervous about the recovery process...
CPTSDmemes,ff9dvq6,t3_es443w,1579710881.0,"The way my EMDR therapist put it is like this: You can learn all the coping skills and mindfulness in the world but because all those skills are ""upstairs brain"" skills and PTSD/ C-PTSD comes from the ""downstairs brain"" plus thats the most dominant working part of your brain, it won't work. You know the skills and they help with getting through EMDR, but you'll never be 100% better until you are desensitized to the trauma."

thesims4,ff91hfu,t1_ff7lqaq,1579702482.0,I just chose one of the formal looks from the city living expansion and it had a black option! You can use any dress for weddings you’d like. Sometimes when they go to the wedding event they’ll change into the standard white ball gown but if you enable “testingcheats true” and right click CAS will come up and you can change them back into what you want. Not sure why it does this when you go to a wedding event (changing automatically into the god awful white ball gown lol)
