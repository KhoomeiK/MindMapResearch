college,ffh3esz,t1_ffh2eqy,1579922037.0,Oh. So sorry this happened
college,ffh0qyt,t3_etkcpr,1579920018.0,Go see your advisor if you haven't already. They usually have to honor the catalog you came in on.
AskAcademia,ffg5p2k,t3_etg2we,1579899008.0,Yep. It sucks but we have to do that as a money-saving measure.
college,fevtf58,t3_eqqfey,1579401258.0,"When students come to me with something like this, my first suggestion is to go to the counseling center. 

If you need to, just take a break this semester and work on your mental health. Maybe you’ll be up to Congress back. 

Best of luck to you!"
college,feaejok,t1_fea0q5n,1578947718.0,You’re welcome and best of luck!
college,fe9tr96,t3_eo7c15,1578941366.0,Go see the chair of your department.
Professors,fdx6tg7,t3_ena49i,1578765910.0,Because I can get a crazy amount of work finished without interruptions.
Professors,fdlo7vx,t3_elylna,1578528527.0,Classes don’t start until Monday. I’ll probably post it then. Unless my grandma dies again.
Professors,fdilqx6,t3_elibdo,1578445727.0,"I do a scavenger hunt for an intro to special ed class. I divide them into groups and give each group a topic with a list of things to look up. I let them use their own tech, each group shares what they found when they’re finished. 

One topic is common myths and misconceptions — can people who are legally blind see anything at all? Can you use a handicap bathroom stall if you do not have a handicap? Etc."

That’s just for one campus, but look at how low the graduation rate is. I’d avoid this one."
college,fdfff3n,t3_el3jk7,1578360431.0,It depends on your institution. Some require it up front and some have payment plans. Try searching for the bursar or registrars office on the college website.
redditrequest,fcwi9d0,t3_ecb8c0,1578026336.0,Please grant this request. This sub needs moderation
college,fcvf8ny,t3_ej4dia,1578000854.0,"No. At my institution we have a due date for entering grades and the registrar contacts us later the same day if any grades are missing. 

Sorry you’re having issues. Have you contacted the professor or department head?"
Professors,fct7dfz,t1_fcrnupr,1577934817.0,"It’s similar to the incomplete policy at my institution. In addition to the request having to be made before grades are submitted, the student has to have completed at least 3/4 of the work and provide documentation that meets the criteria for a university-excused absence. They used to have a year to complete the contract, but it’s recently been reduced to one semester."
Professors,fct6y79,t1_fcolm0g,1577934491.0,I appreciate you letting me know how much work you need to put into this. I am familiar with UDL and luckily so is the design team where I teach.
Professors,fct6qq8,t1_fcokp5a,1577934330.0,"I’ve actually been doing this quite a bit, it’s what gave me the idea. I’ve been moving the course from traditional to online and have been creating quite a bit of content for it."
Professors,fct6nq0,t1_fcoj5z9,1577934267.0,"Good points! I hadn’t even thought of scaling to mobile, beyond iPads. But my undergrads do read on their smartphones so I definitely need to remember this."
Professors,fcp5nwv,t1_fcp32cy,1577851270.0,I’m not working right along with you.
Professors,fcp0lwa,t3_ei9qau,1577846831.0,Thanks everyone. This gives me a lot to research and think about.
college,fcoeoub,t3_ei9n6n,1577830421.0,"If you want to give him feedback,  just let him know you lost track of his email. It happens and I’d bet he’s done the same - I certainly have."
college,fcim217,t1_fcfpd6u,1577664830.0,You’re welcome and best of luck!
college,fcfp1ac,t3_eh6ofs,1577632354.0,"Be careful researching online degrees. Some of those programs only care about getting money and have terrible graduation rates. If an institution ONLY does online, beware."
PhD,fcbwkpz,t1_fcbtygm,1577591767.0,You don’t have to come from an “academic family” to understand how the world works. Less than 50% of academics come from academic families. If you think someone’s tone was curt you either ask them politely about it or get over it.
Professors,fc1sym0,t1_fc1i55u,1577328733.0,This so much! Most of my students make me glad I’m a professor. But those few.....
