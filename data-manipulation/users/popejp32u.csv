news,fetyqan,t1_fetrqrl,1579381398.0,What you hear is correct. Most pedophiles and rapists take (or are forced by other inmates to take) protective custody which keeps them out of general population.

Fitness,feh4lmp,t1_fegvij1,1579109028.0,"IMO there’s a difference between an acquaintance and someone you are definitively working out with.   I would see no obligation to share the equipment with someone I just happen to know and is doing the same exercise as me. Whereas if I’m working out with someone, doing the same routine etc. we would share the same equipment."
Fitness,feh47i5,t1_feglgig,1579108796.0,"They aren’t required to, it would just be common courtesy for 2 people working out together on a busy day to use the same equipment especially with a line of other people who also want to use the equipment forming."

worldnews,fdod55n,t1_fdnv6wu,1578602977.0,"So true. Just wrote something very similar before seeing your post. Ownership and integrity is the foundation governments should be built upon, not fabrication and fallacies."
worldnews,fdocwy8,t3_embvsd,1578602867.0,"What is truly frustrating about this other than the loss of life is the cover-up and lack of ownership. They fucked up, admit it, take responsibility, show remorse and do what you can to help the families of the victims.  Those in power are supposed to lead by example and do the right thing even if it makes you look like shit.  At least your integrity is intact. This doesn’t just apply to the Iranian government, the governments of the world need to learn this very important fact.  Maybe then we can make some progress.

Edit: mistakenly wrote Iraqi vs Iranian government."
