movies,ffa4lt2,t1_ffa4g9j,1579727776.0,bro are you for real? yes dude if you are a fan you NEED to see it. I also believe Mark came back to voice Joker in some of the newer animated movies. Im pretty sure he was Joker again for the Killing joke.
movies,ffa479h,t1_ffa3yib,1579727547.0,90s animated series joker was the best right? Voiced by Mark Hamill. So if we assume that is the best joker (which i do its my opinion) then we would look at who played the closest version of it. Its Nicholson.

I also feel like in general in Japan women arent treated as nice as they should be, and it shows in anime. A strong male lead is way more common than strong female leads, and sometimes even when there is a strong female lead (fire force) they still end up being ""like a girl"" at times and need rescuing or whatever. i feel you bro.

but then there are shows like mob psycho that make everything ok again. but i totally understand what you're saying. the lolli stuff is weird man, i tried watching assassins pride the other week and guess what? i stopped after 1 episode, i cant handle the sexualizing of young girls, just way too weird for me. and i love sexy anime, i just started ""inter species reviewers"" lmao."
