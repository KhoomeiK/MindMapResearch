creepyPMs,fevhkc7,t3_eqcsta,1579397546.0,That's some r/niceguys right there.
niceguys,fdowdjs,t3_embdmn,1578614388.0,"I've never laughed this much about a post on this subreddit, thanks for making my day. Also: I can't believe this dude thought it was completely normal to do... well, literally everything he did and said."

writing,fd2c12v,t3_ejv0dj,1578145025.0,This actually sounds really good. The best stories are when you don't know who to root for because you understand each side.
writing,fclu2ev,t3_ehsd8g,1577756473.0,"I feel this SO MUCH. I wish I had an advice for you, but I'm the same so... good luck, hopefully you'll be able to learn not to edit and just write without thinking about it too much!"
niceguys,fclskqy,t3_ehtn99,1577755437.0,Is your cousin actually friends with this person or how does she know him? Did you send her these screenshots as well?
writing,fcklbp0,t1_fck9ko2,1577727822.0,"Look, I get that you're afraid. We all are when we're letting someone read our stories for the first time, but having beta-readers is ABSOLUTELY essential if you want to do this.

Trust me, I am a perfectionist as well. I always had the urge to re-write my work, up to the point where I wouldn't show it to anyone until it was perfect. But that's not the way. You can't get better on your own. There are things you will miss, there are things that some will like and others will hate - you have to come to terms with it. But you need feedback. 

The truth always hurts, but it's better than living in a lie :)"
FanFiction,fck2s8v,t3_ehenva,1577714865.0,"This is interesting, because I have the opposite problem. I associate Times New Roman with essays and literary analyses that I write for school and therefore I am unable to write my usual stories with this font. For me it means a serious work, not something creative I do for fun. Then again, I've gotten used to the font ""Book Antiqua"" which is not very usual either (my favourite author uses it) and I am kind of unable to write stories in anything else."
creepyPMs,fcb4ctc,t3_egwes2,1577582188.0,Oh my-
FanFiction,fba5965,t1_fb9t7t0,1576665273.0,"Same. Ever since I had to read 20 books as a required reading to school in a short period of time (this happened 2 years back), I've stopped reading almost completely. Maybe I'll read 2 books per year (at most). And just like you, I was a big bookworm, so it just really hurts me that I can't force myself to read/enjoy books anymore. And the worst thing is that it's been hard for me to write too, since writing and reading usually goes hand in hand so you can keep updating your vocabulary."
