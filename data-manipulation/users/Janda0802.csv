bipolar,fdtmrxp,t1_fdtmhsf,1578719029.0,Yeah they are great sleeping buddies!
bipolar,fdtetkv,t3_emvd5y,1578715736.0,Definitely spend some time educating yourself on Bipolar Disorder.
bipolar,fdtefde,t3_emy1au,1578715578.0,Dr. Tracey Marks' videos on youtube. She has a whole bipolar playlist.
bipolar,fdte1st,t3_emz21x,1578715428.0,"I'm currently receiving Unilateral ECT (on just the right side of my head) and I have some minor problems with memory but I haven't forgotten huge chunks of events like I've heard other people describe from Bilateral ECT. So if you do decide to get ECT, it might be worth asking about Unilateral ECT.
If you have any questions about it, I'd be happy to answer them if you DM them to me!"
AskReddit,fdnlpyi,t3_em7trd,1578588426.0,"Not sure if anyone has said it yet, but Webkinz. I'd spend the whole day on Webkinz when I had to go with my mom to her work as a kid."
bipolar,fdn6cxh,t3_em95qu,1578578516.0,"I'm currently on Vraylar and I think it has helped me. My mood feels more stable than it was before. Like one of the other comments mentioned, I did have trouble with muscle twitching and some stiffness in my legs."
bipolar,fdht6x0,t3_elcfg7,1578429710.0,"I understand how you feel. When I was diagnosed, I cried and cried. All I could think about was how I would have this illness forever.

But... Eventually I came to the same realization that someone else already commented on this post. Bipolar is treatable. It's been a pain in the ass trying to find the right medicine, but I know there's one out there and I try to remain hopeful.

I know it's tough buddy, but if you ever need someone to talk to, you can always DM me. Us Bipolar people gotta stick together! :)"
bipolar,fdhrfph,t3_elgfqk,1578428717.0,"Vraylar took a while to get into my system. I didn't feel anything for weeks. But once it did, I did notice my episodes, particularly my highs but also my lows, seemed less extreme than before, even if they were still there. 

Hope that helps."
AskReddit,fdhde4h,t3_elewrv,1578420362.0,"I was trying to book a hotel once on this website and while I was in the checkout stage I was on the phone with my mom asking her if she liked the hotel before I paid. Well this pop up kept popping up over and over again after I clicked out of it telling me to book now before it's gone and that this was the last room (very doubtful given the time I was booking).

I found it extremely irritating, so I booked the same hotel on a different website and I'll never use that original website again."
bipolar,fdeukkw,t1_fdeuhiu,1578346912.0,"Anytime Buddy!
Stay safe! :)"
bipolar,fdeqjsg,t1_fdeqh3q,1578344525.0,"No Problem, Buddy!

Stay safe!"
bipolar,fdeq655,t3_ekzxvn,1578344301.0,"Dr. Tracey Marks (she's a psychiatrist) has a really great youtube playlist for bipolar, and she goes over both rapid cycling and mixed episodes really well. You should check her out.

Rapid Cycling

Mixed Episodes

bipolar,fddntdm,t3_ektylk,1578318986.0,"For an elevated mood to qualify as mania, it has to last about a week, or 4 days for hypomania (which would be bipolar 2). 
As I think you may already know, Bipolar means you have distinct episodes of depression and mania.

You should really check out some of Dr. Tracey Marks' videos on youtube. She explains it really well."
bipolar,fdcepom,t3_ekkifi,1578273076.0,I love this so much! I think I might get one just like this!
bipolar,fdbrh9z,t3_ekg485,1578260858.0,"Stay away from energy drinks and limit your caffeine intake. I even switched to decaf coffee. It felt weird the first couple of weeks, but I started to realize I didn't really need caffeine to wake up in the morning."
bipolar,fdblnrk,t3_ekj3gz,1578258567.0,"I'm so sorry you feel this way. I know there's not much I can do to help, but if you need someone to talk to (or even just unload on), feel free to DM me.

Be safe and if you get to the point where you are ready to hurt or kill yourself, do not be afraid to go to the ER."
bipolar,fd95fhg,t3_ekbqsf,1578228638.0,"If you feel like it's getting much worse before Tuesday, you can always go to the ER and tell them you're suicidal, they will get you into the mental ward. You don't necessarily have to wait until Tuesday if the suicidal thoughts become too much.

Please be safe and if you need anyone to talk to, feel free to DM me."
bipolar,fd92926,t3_ekbdsh,1578227255.0,"Stopping a medicine suddenly can absolutely do things like that to you. I'm not a doctor, but I've heard stories like that before.

If I were you, I'd write down all of these things you're noticing so you'll remember to bring them all up to your doctor at your appointment.

Still, I'm sorry the price of medicine is keeping you from taking it. I'm currently on Vraylar right now as well, but I'm still on the samples the doctor gave me. If the medicine is that expensive, it sounds like I wouldn't be able to continue it either."
bipolar,fd6f5ed,t1_fd6espe,1578190043.0,"I personally don't have problems with oversleeping, but I'm not sure if other people oversleep on Trazedone. 

And no problem! Our community is here for you! If you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to DM me!"
bipolar,fd6e8ay,t1_fd6dg71,1578189630.0,"I understand. I had a similar problem for a while when I worked the night shift at the front desk of a residence hall at my college. I had to quit-- I just couldn't miss that much sleep and remain stable.

If you have trouble actually getting to sleep, it might be worth asking your doctor for something to help you sleep. My doctor prescribed me Trazedone, and it's really helped me."
bipolar,fd682ml,t3_ek11qa,1578186919.0,"Work with your doctor to find the right medication for you and DO NOT stop taking it, even if you feel better. 

Get on a schedule, wake up and go to sleep same times every day. And stay away from energy drinks or other things with a lot of caffeine."
bipolar,fd67bo6,t3_ek4ubh,1578186583.0,Good luck! We're rooting for you!
bipolar,fd65q25,t3_ek5hjp,1578185898.0,"It's gonna be hard, not gonna lie. I'm still trying to find the right medication for me, but I try to remain optomistic that when I do, things will be better. (Or at least more stable anyways.)

If you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to DM me. I know it's hard going through this kind of thing alone, but this community is super supportive.

Hang in there buddy!"
bipolar,fd57arp,t1_fd55wvl,1578174910.0,Secondary Education and Mathematics. I want to be a math teacher!
bipolar,fd5194e,t3_ek2ktc,1578173205.0,"I used to work the front desk at a college residence hall in the middle of the night. It didn't work out for me at all. It destroyed my sleep schedule and I ended up performing poorly in my classes.
The only recommendation I have (based on my experience) is to avoid energy drinks, no matter how strong the temptation."
bipolar,fd50l49,t3_ek1jib,1578172979.0,Congratulations! You should be very proud of yourself!
bipolar,fd43qgd,t1_fd436qi,1578164127.0,"That sounds cool. Something always coming in to keep you entertained.
I had to medically withdraw from school this semester and even with all the videogames I have, I get bored pretty often."
bipolar,fczojqx,t3_ejpc21,1578105740.0,I love videogames! That seems to be the only thing that I really enjoy these days.
bipolar,fczob0p,t1_fczm968,1578105599.0,Absolutely agree with this. Sometimes I feel like I'm too empathetic.
bipolar,fcznp8a,t1_fcye22k,1578105221.0,I use Daylio as well and I think it's absolutely worth the one time payment.
bipolar,fczngla,t3_ejkxfp,1578105061.0,All I want is to find the right medicine for me so I can get stable and get back in school starting this summer.
bipolar,fcuuz4c,t3_ej0bkx,1577989066.0,"Now this is some helpful, relatable content."

bipolar,fcown5p,t1_fcovj8c,1577843601.0,"I'm so sorry to hear that. If you ever need anyone to talk to, DM me. 
I hope you start feeling better soon, I know how hard that road is, but it'll be worth it if you stick to treatment!"
bipolar,fcov1wx,t3_ei8a0t,1577842348.0,Started showing symptoms and was originally diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder at 16. I wasn't diagnosed with Bipolar until about age 20.
bipolar,fcourf5,t3_ei92gy,1577842117.0,I have entire days where I'm irrationally angry at the silliest things. The silliest has got to be strangers standing too close to me.
bipolar,fcouha6,t3_ei9cm3,1577841891.0,Have fun!
FiveFingerDeathPunch,fckms5v,t3_eh8z1e,1577728713.0,When the seasons change
unpopularopinion,fcg2918,t3_egmjh9,1577635864.0,"I think you severely misunderstand. I really don't know where to start, but I think many of the other comments here have put it perfectly. Suicide isn't selfish or cowardly, and it is incredibly selfish to view another person's struggle through only your own lense.
If you would ever like to talk about mental illness seriously, please DM me and I'd be happy to talk with you about why suicide happens. I realize dealing with suicide of a loved one is hard, but you have come to the wrong conclusion. I'm here if you need someone to talk to."
bipolar,fc15et0,t3_efhnhh,1577308760.0,"Congratulations buddy! I've quit drinking before just to bounce back to where I was before I quit... I'm wishing you more luck with your journey. If you ever need anyone to talk to, DM me! 
Merry Christmas and best of luck to you!"
TheRightCantMeme,fb3az6b,t3_eaygu0,1576468397.0,This is horrific.
