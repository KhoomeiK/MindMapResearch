-------------
According to BBC research, the majority of UK police forces saw a fall in homicides compared with 2018.

West Midlands Police said the number fell from 51 in 2018 to 39 last year; while homicides in Greater Manchester were down from 64 to 39.

In Merseyside the homicide level halved, down from 21 to 10, while West Yorkshire Police launched 21 homicide investigations in 2019 compared with 39 in 2018.

Merseyside Police's Assistant Chief Constable Ian Critchley said this was down to a ""relentless suppression"" of serious organised crime and also reducing the number of domestic violence killings.

""At the other end, it is about stopping young people getting into crime in the first place,"" he said.

""We will target relentlessly people who feel they can control what is taking place in order to obtain money and use bullying, cowardly tactics to groom young people to carry knives and firearms.""
----------------

As for the crime stats, here is the official data set from the government, split down by county police forces: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/policeforceareadatatables

The third tab, Table 3, shows the rates of each region (North East, North West, etc) and then the county forces underneath it.

The overall crime rate in England is at 88.4, with the three highest regions being the NE (109.0), Yorks and Humber (107.3) and the NW (103.4).  

The crime rates (per 1000 people) for some major cities are as follows:

Leeds (West Yorks, Y&H) 127.6;                                                                                                                 
Newcastle (Cleveland, NE) 120.7;                                                                                                           
Manchester (Greater Mancs, NW) 116.7;                                                                                                   
Hull (Humberside, Y&H) 110.1;                                                                                                                
Sheffield (South Yorks, Y&H) 102.3;                                                                                                            
London (Metropolitan, London) 99.4;                                                                                                       
Liverpool (Merseyside, NW) 93.7;                                                                                                               
Nottingham (Nottingham, East Midlands) 92.7;                                                                                                      
Birmingham (West Midlands, West Midlands) 90.0;                                                                                        

The crime rate definitely shows a north south divide, with more criminal behaviour in the north than the south (except London), with the Midlands in between, physically and criminally.  Counties containing cities tend to have more crime too.  Liverpool's crime rate (93.4 show it to be a city equivalent to a Midlands city like Birmingham (90.0) or Nottingham (92.7), rather than a northern city like Leeds, Manchester or Newcastle.

When you break down the cities by crime, Liverpool's only outlier is Drug Offences which is more than double the national rate.  Scousers are unfairly stereotyped as thieves and robbers, but the rates of Shoplifting, Bike Thefts, Residential Burglaries, Non-Residential Burglaries, Vehicle Offences, Robberies, Theft from the Person, are all lower in Liverpool than in England as a whole."

Many years and even then the nuclear plant still takes well over a decade to start generating power.  How many politicans are inspirational enough to turn the whole political discourse on nuclear around and get Joe Bloggs to back nuclear in their own back gardens?

Personally, I don't see it happening, unless there is a massive technological revolution in the fission industry, and frankly I see fusion happening before that so imo it would make for a better bet politically and socially speaking.

10 years ago, Britain got less than 5% of its electricity from renewables - now it gets 40% and this is increasing all the time as new sources come online and the climate emergency get even more emergencier.  The tools to decarbonise electricity grids is here already with renewables.  It just requires the political will, especially in the US.

Ralla - railway - ""Don't be going near the ralla or you'll get killed.  Or if I find out you've been near it - I'll kill ya!""  My mother to me as a kid.

Leccy - electricity, probably not limited to scouse

Shrapnel - coins - ""Your auld fella has gone to bed pissed, go rifle through his kecks for shrapnel for your school money tomorrow.  Bring me the notes!""  Mother again!

Kecks - trousers - see shrapnel above.

Meff - tramp or tramp-like - ""Eww, go get changed - I'm not being seen with you looking like a meff.""

Baltic - freezing, cold - ""it's Baltic out there, my nipples are gonna drop off.""

Minty - dirty - ""that bathroom was minty - you'd need a chisel to clean that toilet.""

Lolly ice - ice lolly

The French law will make tax avoidance by companies with intricate international tax structures less profitable and ensures France gets its fair share of tax receipts before these companies wash them through said schemes.

There are ongoing global/regional discussions to create tax systems that ensure corporations pay taxes on profits in the places they make them but they constantly stall.  France and other countries are looking to implement these laws to ensure action happens now and to incentivise the world to put something better in place.  Whilst the stratus quo means that these companies don’t have to pay their fair share, then countries that benefit from the system as it is will slow or block progress on updating international standards.  With France and others going their own way, the calculus changes and corporations and countries may find it more beneficial to harmonise on a fairer tax system."
europe,fdn78dr,t1_fdn66lq,1578579191.0,These companies pay little to no corporation taxes in France.  How would you incentivise them?  France give them money instead?  These taxes will ensure that the tech companies are paying a fairer share of taxes for the services that they use there.

Nuclear in the west is dead unless there is a revolution in the technology.  Even France which currently gets 75% of its electricity from nuclear has mandated that this share should fall to 50% by 2035.
