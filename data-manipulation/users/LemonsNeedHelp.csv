Because there is either something or nothing after death it’s 50/50, so 50% chance an afterlife exists. That’s quite the jump.  And it will only stay at 50% or get higher with more research into NDE’s etc, never lower. Nobody can prove anything but they can’t disprove anything either. The jump between the numbers comforts me a lot. This universe is far too complex for there to be nothing."

It’s ignorant to dismiss the idea nothing created all this, especially when scientists love talking about different dimensions but can’t accept the possibility of a god. Are we really supposed to accept: nothing + no God = something, as the equation for the universe?

It is horrible to not know, but if we did know about the afterlife/reincarnation, would we live our lives or just kill ourselves and keep hoping for something better until we get what we want? I guess the mystery is what keeps us grounded. Nothingness would be the biggest wtf. Also another thing to contemplate is everything that exists, doesn’t stop existing, it just changes, like the conservation of energy. Our consciousness in some way existed before and it will again"

I have an incurable degenerative neurological condition which will kill me probably in the next 5 years too; I am 24. I also use a wheelchair because of it. I lost any faith I had because of the diagnosis (at 16) and since have spent my time trying to regain faith in the world and, like you, make sense of everything. One thing I have begun to appreciate is my life is now about learning how to overcome any of the obstacles in my life, my experience may one day influence someone else's experience. This also sits well with what NDE experiencers report too, which is that we are here to learn from our existence. I am no longer angry at the world or God for giving me this life, but it does continue to break my heart to see other people struggle and suffer. And so I think the best thing we can do for each other is to help and to love one another, and give them a purpose to their lives, and in turn they will give us a purpose to ours. This is essentially what Jesus told us to do. The philosophies and the ethics of religion will never stop being relevant.

As for death, you're right, if there is nothing then why do we exist at all? Why does the Universe exist? I don't know what happens, but I do believe something does, it has too. The odds of us existing is approx [1 in 400 trillion](https://www.lottoland.co.uk/magazine/what-are-the-odds-.html) but the odds of something after death jumps all the way to 50%, and that figure won't ever get lower only higher, no matter how good science gets, that's pretty incredible. Nobody has ever *come back* because you can't revive the physical body, but if your consciousness can detach from the physical then who knows what would happen?

As for the white light, it's good to remember how people who undergo surgery and go into cardiac failure can see it. This is a brain that's still under heavy anaesthetic and has now got no supply of oxygen, I find it very hard to accept it as a mere hallucination. Also which part of the brain is responsible for being told 'it's not your time yet?'

I don't think any one faith is the correct one, I think they all point to the same thing, it doesn't matter which you follow, or don't follow. Whatever happens we will all find out soon enough."
death,feitn26,t1_fei8dj9,1579146902.0,"Another thing to add is that even single celled organisms can show signs of consciousness so the idea that it’s just a byproduct of the brain isn’t necessarily the case. This bacteria is capable of learning which means it’s somehow able to retain memories without a complex nervous system

NDE,feh1ezd,t1_fegzme2,1579107129.0,"“Other versions of shared death experiences that baffled me were those events that were shared by several people at the bedside. It is possible for a skeptic to easily write off a dying person’s death experience when it is shared with only one other person. But a death experience shared with a number of people at the bedside is more difficult to pass off as an individual fantasy.
Take, for example, the experience of the Anderson family, from a suburb of Atlanta, as they sat by their dying mother. This is told by one of the sisters, but all who were there corroborate the account:
“The day my mother died, my two brothers, my sister, my sister-in-law and I were all in the room. My mother hadn’t spoken a word in several hours, and she was breathing in an irregular pattern. None of us were really upset because mother had been on a long downhill course and we knew this was the end.
“Suddenly, a bright light appeared in the room. My first thought was that a reflection was shining through the window from a vehicle passing by outside. Even as I thought that, however, I knew it wasn’t true, because this was not any kind of light on this earth. I nudged my sister to see if she saw it too, and when I looked at her, her eyes were as big as saucers. At the same time I saw my brother literally gasp. Everyone saw it together and for a little while we were frightened.
“Then my mother just expired and we all kind of breathed a big sigh of relief. At that moment, we saw vivid bright lights that seemed to gather around and shape up into … I don’t know what to call it except an entranceway. The lights looked a bit like clouds, but that is only a comparison. We saw my mother lift up out of her body and go through that entranceway. Being by the entranceway, incidentally, was a feeling of complete joy. My brother called it a chorus of joyful feelings, and my sister heard beautiful music, although none of the rest of us did.
“I am originally from Virginia and my sister, brother and I agreed that the entranceway was shaped something like the Natural Bridge in the Shenandoah Valley. The lights were so vivid we had no choice but to tell our story to the hospice nurse.
“She listened and then told us that she knew of similar things happening and that it was not uncommon for the dying process to encompass people nearby.”
