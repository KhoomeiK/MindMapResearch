But I don't feel guilty for being better off financially by not having kids- it isn't not my fault others chose parenthood when they weren't financially stable beforehand.

Pam olive oil, 1 second spray 

1/2 cup zucchini, chopped 

2 T lemon juice 

2 T balsamic vinegar 

Garlic powder and salt to taste 

Baby spinach for garnish

Cook couscous according to package directions 

Cook chicken in pan spritzed with Pam until lightly browned. Add lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, salt and garlic. 

Add zucchini to chicken + other vegetables if desired (carrots, beets, or other root vegetables would work well). Stir everything together 

After couscous is done, take off burner and let cool for 5 minutes. Mix in chicken and vegetables, with another splash of the vinegar.

Add feta last to prevent it melting too much.

Serve with baby spinach"

I loved walking in the woods, bought incense with my allowance, obsessed with my mom's candle collection, collected seashells, gemstones and crystals; studied astronomy (and astrology, though less intensely), was fascinated by Greco-Roman and Egyptian mythology, etc...

In my early 20s I reconnected with an Aunt who had been ostracized by the family. She was openly pagan, and that sparked an interest in me. Did some research on the religion and eventually realized I had been one my whole life.

Came out of the broom closet to myself a few years later,  been spiritually at peace since"

Yule/winter solstice: celebrate the longest night of the year with seasonal foods, drinking, dancing, and a candle lighting. 

Christmas eve: dinner and gift exchange with the in-laws (Catholic side of family). 

Christmas day: visit my family (protestant), have lunch/dinner and swap gifts. I'll offend my mom by playing Twisted Sister and pagan music.
