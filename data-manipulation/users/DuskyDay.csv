Showerthoughts,ffvjl5w,t1_ffmrsgv,1580265642.0,"> There are entire plot lines around it. Such as the case where the Riker on the origin pad wasn't killed but the Riker on the destination pad was created.

Those are based on the scriptwriters of that particular episode not understanding how exactly transporters worked.

The transporter moves the original particles in the annular confinement beam to the destination where the object is reconstructed.

Inside the **a**nnular **c**onfinement **b**eam (**ACB**) you have the matter stream (the stream of the particles of the transported object). The modulation of the ACB contains information about which particle goes where.

In case of interference (which weakens the ACB and therefore loses some resolution), the transporter chief can initiate a *second* ACB to combine them later in the transporter (because combining two analog signals, where each of which has randomly lost some information, will help you restore some of it). So what will happen that each ACB will have some of the matter in it.

In the episode with Thomas Riker, they *forgot this*, and they had both ACB contain the complete matter stream each (which is impossible). One ACB made it back to the ship and reconstructed the original Riker.

The *second* ACB was reflected back from the ionosphere (which acted like a mirror, preserving the information in the second ACB the same way ordinary mirror preserves the reflected image instead of dispersing it). This is where the second scriptwriter error comes in - the ACB with the matter stream inside needs a transporter on at least one side to reconstruct the original object - but there was no transporter on the starting site (Riker was beaming from the planet), and no transporter on the place of the materialization (the second Riker materialized back on the planet). So what *should've* happened was the reflected ACB going through the planet and eventually losing coherence in deep space. But alas, nobody did their homework.

So even if you needed to be made of the same matter for you not to be killed (which you don't), transporters still wouldn't kill you.
