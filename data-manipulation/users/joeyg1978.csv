AskReddit,fdsvqxp,t1_fdrldo2,1578708565.0,"As an Australian, the fires have never ever been this bad. Access to national parks in order to back burn has consistently been denied by certain political parties in order to preserve wildlife. That combined with arsonists (180 people charged to date nationally) plus extreme weather conditions and poorly implemented disaster plans have all combined to what we are experiencing here in Australia. Three things are needed to start a fire: Ignition, Oxygen and Fuel. One of those we can control; Fuel. Without fuel there is no fire. Clean forrest ground by back burning like they used to 30 years ago, and we wouldn't have such a disaster, yes you still get fires, but they won't get out of control. I believe in Climate Change I don't think Climate Change was the whole cause, climate change (extreme heat) certainly played a part along with other factors. I also believe Sott Morrison is a Cunt! What fucking Leader goes on a family vacation while YOUR COUNTRY IS FUCKING BURNING!!!"
