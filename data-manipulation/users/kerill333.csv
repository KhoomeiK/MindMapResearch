femalefashionadvice,feoeyi2,t3_epzxcz,1579299156.0,"I have stayed pretty much the same size for decades and am a clothes hoarder, so quite a few things.
A couple of pure silk camisoles from Next in the 80s (!) which are always machine washed on low and still fine.
A checked wool jacket in cream, tan and bright pink from Firetrap which is early 90s and still gets compliments. 
Tan faux suede trousers from Joseph in the 90s... Still look perfect. (Sadly the faux leather ones fell apart - faux leather is best avoided!)
A turquoise lambskin gilet from back then - so good I just bought another in tan.
Black stretch fabric knee high boots from mid-80s, still. Look great, not dated at all. 
Black stretch pencil skirt from then, also ageless. 
Oversized knitted denim sweater from Jigsaw in the 90s, ditto. 
I absolutely love my old favourites.


Edited to try to answer the additional question - I don't think they help me pick things that will be my long-term staples now. I just can't tell. Things I deliberated over for hours can be hopeless, things I bought on the spur of the moment can be absolute winners. 
I guess single colours, and textures, and quality. That's all I can take from it."
