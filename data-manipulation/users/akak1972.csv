SoftwareEngineering,ffum2xl,t3_erg25h,1580244837.0,"Very confusing explanation, with a worrying overlap of functional requirements (wrt errors, for example) with technical limitations.

Technically sure you solved it - but it sounds like everything I generally try to avoid: being simply brilliant rather than being brilliantly simple, AND  being nearly completely locked in to existing reality and requirements.

You seem to have implemented Java's volatile (= compare and swap rather than synchronize) in a roundabout and semi-distributed way. 

A transaction is ultimately either linear == state machine transformations, or a branch-and-prune flow == (at worst) ""I am proceeding along 2 tracks outta X (X = unknown!) because other options did not pass my filter for allowing to proceed beyond this point""

So now you have clearly identified criteria for progress, and your transaction management is modularized: you don't know all the various permutations that could lead to a transaction, but you CAN identify the minimum needs for advancement. And you can specify the needs to step N to N+1 in a module.

Which allows you to define a complete transaction by configurations, rather than the hardcoded understanding implied in the current pseudo-code. 

In short: think permissible steps that add up to a transaction rather than defining a transaction at Step 1!

This also gives you the ability to handle spoofed transactions without suddenly having to rethink everything.

Sure the design is way more complex now. But now you can compartmentalize it to departments (technical OR functional departments), each defining their criteria of advancement in a flexible manner, and you have added hack-attack protection possibility (bugaboo of security - completely missing in the stated design) - and MOST importantly: you have made it simple for your internal users. 

The current service design is a yes or no service - which may work well upto a point - but it is more like ""this is the way business has to proceed"" - sheer horror of a design"

Effectively, Computer science is at a deeper level and is more about science (=theory and principles) side of it. A computer scientist equivalent in auto industry would be someone who creates an intetnal combustion engine, using scientific principles to ensure it is practically useful in a given range of scenarios.


An engineer will take the principle and convert it to an actual working sample like a product or a website or higher abstractions like servers. An engineer in an auto world would take the combustion engine, tune it, customize it, but largely preserve the basic science before applying it in cars, trucks, etc.

I hope things get better for you, whether or not you believe they can or will."
AskReddit,ffiy0r7,t1_ffix2uq,1579985500.0,Thanks. Your YT channel is nanoJuggernaut like the spelling here?
AskReddit,ffixrqv,t3_ettxzn,1579985319.0,"I will assume you want to help someone who has suffered this atrocity.

First, forget the word ""help"". At times it makes you think like a mini God - having the power to give someone ""help"". Makes you feel you are operating from a higher, advanced pedestal

All you do is spend time with them. Just be there.

Uncomfortable silence? Hang around

They turn their resentment on YOU? Stay calm. Just stay

It seems they are getting worse? Stay on

You feel like a failure because you can't gauge their moods / anxieties / panics at all? Stay on anyway

They ask you to let them be alone? Go in a different room. 

Or go back to your house but let them know your phone is on 24/7.

Anything more that you can do is a bonus."

AskReddit,ffivq6j,t1_ffioae3,1579983855.0,"I know the feeling because I had a very similar experience at around 15 years of age. 

The worst part to me was not that anybody did not help, but that my thoughts when almost dying were:

1) This is not how it happens in the movies - no whole life flashing by in seconds

2) Why are my final thoughts about movies?"
