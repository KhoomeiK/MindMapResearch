Honestly, if companies want to save on real estate costs, how about letting people work from home? I have a marvelous office at home, nice and quiet, 10x more powerful computer, all the amenities.

I’m guessing that whatever companies save on real estate is more than offset by lower productivity per person and perhaps higher average salaries. Perhaps not the case in San Francisco and similar extremely high cost places. I know that I will take lower pay if a position has an office. If it doesn’t, I’m asking for way more compensation. I’m guessing it’s the same for a lot of people... except those who don’t have a choice. Places with open offices tend to pay quite a bit more in salary, I’ve observed anecdotally."

MurderedByWords,ffmciu7,t3_eu68x4,1580052374.0,"To the extent that giving workers more benefits does not increase efficiency... it just increases costs for the general population, as corporations pass on their higher costs as higher prices. Greater regulations can also result in less competition among corporations, as larger organizations can handle the regulations more efficiently which translates to lower prices for customers and greater market share. As oligopolies form and entrench, it becomes difficult for new businesses to enter the space.

If worker benefits results in greater social equality, though, I’m all for it... because income inequality is approaching medieval levels."

SecurityAnalysis,ff7ajab,t3_erx3lh,1579644681.0,"The rules for goodwill are fine as they are. Goodwill is just a necessary accounting plug and is ignored by most analysts. The write-down rule is useful because it provides a signals to investors that management is saying “we fucked up and there’s no hiding it any longer lest our auditors call foul and we get sued by the SEC.” Otherwise, it’s pointless. Amortizing goodwill would be idiocy, every analyst would just back it out. 

If we should make a change at all, I would suggest that large cap companies be required to have the goodwill test be done by an outside valuation firm and goodwill is impaired if the value is less than book... no undiscounted cash flow test. That would mostly solve the issue, so long as the valuation firm has the right incentives."
