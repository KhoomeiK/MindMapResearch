leagueoflegends,fexy9cy,t1_fexr07h,1579438221.0,"> Especially if you play ranked I'm not really surprised people who play bad get flamed - and I'm not going to blame the other people either. If you're bad at a game where other people depend on you to do well I'd really suggest you just don't play the game or only play it with friends. 

By that standard, we're all bad. Unless you're masters +, you're going to be making hundreds of individual mistakes per game, easily. It's just that most won't spot them. 

Flaming people for ""being bad"" is nonsensical in a ranked system that matches you with players closer to your skill level. You're not much better than the person you think is horrible, if you're better at all."

An appeal to futility isn't a good argument, or an argument at all. Maybe it won't go away, but I'll sure as hell try to make it go away, same with the war on drugs itself. 

> What we need to do is stop this blue wall of silence bullshit and hold Leo's to a higher standard than the rest of us, not a lower standard. And make them personally responsible for any financial burden their actions impose on their victims. Cops should get more jailtime for commiting crimes than anyone else. Not less.

Water and electricity are what, around $300 per month on average? Internet, maybe $50. TV, who needs TV? Mortgage isn't required, you can rent to buy through your mother. What would rent be on a 0% ""loan"" from her mother on $90,000? If it's over 15 years, that's just $500 per month.

Meaning their total monthly expenses in the mandatory category wouldn't even exceed $1,000. 

Now add in home insurance and repairs and you're looking at another $300 per month. So total expenses are at $1,150. Add in expenses for a car, with gas, maybe figure $400 (probably less than that). That's $1,550. Now add in food and clothing and toiletries. Another $500. 

Total yearly mandatory expenses = $24,600. 

They make $35,000 per year **net** income, which is after taxes. That's totally fine. That means after all mandatory expenses they're in the black for $10,400, while working towards owning a home in 15 years. Absolutely great. 

Oh right, property taxes too, on a $180,000 property that'd be what, $3,000 at most? So reduce that black by 3k. Still great."

I'm confused if people just aren't paying attention, but no.. the labor market is horrid. Income has barely risen over the past 40 years, productivity neither, labor force participation rate is barely up (decreasing relative to population size). And then the whole of the stock market is a gargantuan bubble ready to pop (thanks to the fed). 

We're on the verge of the worst recession in our history, and people think this is a strong economy. Absolutely baffling."
