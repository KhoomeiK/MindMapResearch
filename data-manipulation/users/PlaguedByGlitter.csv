shittyfoodporn,ffu5kuy,t3_euprrt,1580234968.0,"I am equally as obsessed.  I add extra seasoning maybe some tomatoes, onions, or even squash if I'm feeling extra bold. 
Edit. Also if you like these check out jacks pizzas they are about 1.25 and are good when you want something a little different."
FundieSnark,ffpvufg,t1_ffmvuy4,1580107689.0,Thanks for pointing it out. I never realized that her hand was crotch level.  Looks like shes about to pull the baby out herself. Not that she'd ever do that because she'd rather be a womanly incubator for the most perfect cherub ever to be conceived in a godly union between a wife and her manly manly husband.
Instagramreality,ffplhh5,t1_ffninyk,1580097993.0,I took accutane as well and despite my skin being so incredibly dry that itd break in spots . Taking accutane was totally worth it my skin is so much better. And less oily

StardewValley,ffajtum,t1_ffa6xgv,1579737514.0,Well I can't say that was the onlyyyy thing. But the other thing was probably my own fault. I was sooooooo excited to get to the desert i thought it'd be like a whole town. So when I finally arrived I looked around and was like this is it.
AskReddit,ffa4mzn,t3_esc8vq,1579727794.0,I would give them all of my old homework and papers to save some time also so that they could see the critiques from the teachers and such. Also I'd tell them spend more time with your grandmother.
StardewValley,ffa4ery,t1_ff8ll0u,1579727665.0,"Obviously the sexy goes with out saying. And I think its based off our body. Also I totally agree with the dog thing. It seems like a missed opportunity. I remember when i first got the game I kept trying to feed it or bring it with me. I finally just looked it up and was like oh, that's all...."

aww,fd0i7hy,t1_fd0cuk2,1578119169.0,"I absolutely love the organization.  My second pyr Magnolia is only 75 lbs, but I'm pretty sure shes mixed with something. I actually got her a doggie dna test.  My newest pyr is a big girl weighing in at at least 115. She is makes maggs look anorexic"
aww,fcysz3h,t1_fcyegx1,1578086416.0,"Great pyrs are the absolute best. Im so sorry for your loss. I lost my first pyr, Catherine, last August from osteosarcoma.  It destroyed me. We ended up getting anither pyr pretty soon after because our 2nd pyr Magnolia was still fairly young and needed a friend. If you ever decide to get another one check out saving pyrs in need it is a texas based organization that I've gotten my last two pyrs from."
TooAfraidToAsk,fclyvcs,t3_ehrok6,1577759855.0,"I am in the same boat as you. Im 23(f) and I don't feel any of those warmy fuzzy feelings that you are ""supposed"" have regarding them. I realized a long time ago that I don't want children. Everyone tries to say that, oh you don't know what you're saying or that it is different when it is your own. 
I just ignore that now because I know that I am just not the child having type. And that is okay. It's also okay to have children and enjoy it, it is even okay to say you don't want children and then some day change your mind, or never change your mind. 
What isn't okay is when people are pushed into having children that they really don't want just because that is what is expected of them. It is then when the parents and the children suffer. Its better to not have a child then to bring one in that you dont have your whole heart involved in raising it.
When people question you, you have a few options and it depends on who is questioning you. You can say nothing or you can explain why you don't want children. One thing you never do is let them pressure you into a life you arent made for."
