OldSchoolCool,fehxjdk,t1_fehs2rq,1579125851.0,"You understand that there is only one significant difference between Russia and America. 

When 8 000 000 people die in russia, it’s some single tyrant persona “worked them to death”. 

When 8 000 000 die in USA (drugs or just sheer gluten of a lifestyle) you quickly realize they were all “free” and worked/ate/sacrificed themself to death somehow voluntarily. Can’t really blame a single person. Takes 15 signatures to do layoffs at corporation. Sorry boys “company” decided this is not gonna work anymore. All of the sudden all those deaths are “just life”.

Difference is decentralized governance. 

People are all the same, communists vs capitalists is not cats vs dogs its human vs human just different packaging."

QuakeChampions,fc3phgd,t3_efs9xz,1577395375.0,"Should be based on your need, can be anything that gets you to the desired goal, are you not able to shoot in certain situations, execute certain maneuvers? Then you need go play around and find sweet spot between tracking and navigation.

I usually just make sure my mousepad width is 180 rotation in the game. And that gets me all I need. All I need is to be able to rotate and shoot backwards fast.

So start with by setting mouse to one edge of mousepad and move to another and dial sens until its 180 in game.

I use medium Artisan Hien mousepad so I use full width, obviously this 180 wont work for you if you have table width pad, then go be feel set arm to outmost right you comfortable with and then move to the left and stop at utmost comfortable and then dial sense so that range left to right is 180, usually gives nice slow sens that good for LG/Rail and then can flick rockets as-well.

Its all personal preference tho."
