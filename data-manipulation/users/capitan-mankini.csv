dogswithjobs,fep73v6,t1_feot6a8,1579313619.0,There is a ton of really interesting science behind snow and the way it holds together or doesn't. Taking an AIRE course is a really fun and interactive way to learn about it. Also it is heavily advised if you want to go into any non avalanche controlled area (even side country).
RBI,feoqw13,t1_feoof8i,1579304225.0,Really? It seems pretty common to refer to it like that in my area.
dogswithjobs,feoqcmq,t1_fenh01s,1579303901.0,"True, just make sure that you don't take more risks just because you have an inflating backpack."
dogswithjobs,feopwb4,t1_fencef8,1579303732.0,"The article is kinda right kinda wrong, depending on the snow conditions there is some stuff you can do to stay above the snow but it's not really like swimming in water. Avalanche snow often packs together and becomes more similar to rocks so it'd be like trying to swim while caught in the middle of a rock slide. Many people who get caught in avalanches don't actually die of asphyxiation, it's mostly from the trauma of being crushed by heavy hard chunks of ice."
Backcountry,feo5wqm,t1_fen9pa1,1579295493.0,"I've got shifts, blizzard zero G 105s and some hawx 120s and I love it the skis feel great and the shifts rock for downhill, I use all of it both in and out of bounds rn. The only problem I have is with how light the setup is (and how light I am) it gets hard to bust through the heavier wetter snow. All of the gear absolutely rocks in powder though!"
Crushes,fenz1s5,t1_fenue6p,1579292911.0,"Yeah I had a girl who I asked out before school ended and she rejected me but then at the end of the summer she said she actually liked me and was just embarrassed. The main thing you gotta do is just have confidence, you go get what you want and don't wait a ton to think about it. Good luck

Edit: I just read another comment of yours where you said you didn't feel like you deserved to be with him or something. You gotta stop with that, nobody isn't ""worthy"" of love that's a shitty way to think and will kill any relationship where you continue to believe that. Again good luck and believe in yourself."
dogswithjobs,fencapk,t1_fen5w92,1579281620.0,"Their main problem is they don't protect in terrain traps, so if you get caught in a valley and the snow keeps piling up you're still gonna get buried. Also if you hit a tree or rock you'll still get messed up from that."
dogswithjobs,fenc4pb,t1_fen5sby,1579281517.0,You can't really you can try to stay on top but depending on what type of avalanche the only thing that'll help you stay on top is one of those blow up backpacks.
WTF,fdsum4j,t1_fdrytqg,1578708147.0,The dude I replied to was talking about covering the building in snow
WTF,fdplvcz,t1_fdplkp6,1578632283.0,"There's no way that will make any snow, snow makers don't make snow they just blow mist which turns into snow if it's cold enough."
dankmemes,fdpifg0,t1_fdpe9rl,1578629480.0,"I'm a big fan of Firefox/adnausaem, adnausaem blocks ads but also tells them that you clicked on them. So websites and YouTubers still get revenue and I don't have to see ads. The only one that gets screwed is advertisers which I'm chill with for the most part."
Nicegirls,fdi5afr,t1_fdhz791,1578435981.0,"Lots of people feel that, it's hard as a guy to feel wanted in a relationship because it's expected that we make the first moves and carry things. One of the things that helped me is to just chill out and make friends without expecting anything or trying to make it something more. If they want to be with you let them make the move. All of that's easier said than done though, good luck."
Backcountry,fdi4kwq,t1_fdi3o5a,1578435627.0,I have a pair of shifts and what I've heard the main difference is the way your toe releases is a whole lot safer on the shifts than pins because it can slide sideways like a normal downhill binding. Less likely to mess up your knees in a twisting crash.

interestingasfuck,fc0j5uc,t1_fc01446,1577291998.0,"There isn't a ton of wildlife living in the area, also there's a whole lot of mountains around that aren't even touched. Out of all of humans environmental impacts skiing is relatively light."
