Not with Trump.  Just find a way to get someone near him to say something that hurts his feelings and he will react. He probably only knows “of Parnas” and has never told him to do shit. Yet Parnas and his merry men of doofus were able to manipulate that dumbass into helping them in their scheme to take over an oil company in Ukraine.

No. Itâ€™s because he needs to know who was involved in case there is any report about him.  You know say this shit goes viral or something and people start making false reports about the officer as if they were one of those people.   

Any investigation of any kind a cop has to make his best attempt to document those involved so itâ€™s filed away. For example letâ€™s say that lady isnâ€™t done. A few months later she shows up and shoots that guy and she gets away.
