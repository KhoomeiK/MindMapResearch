People in power are just fine with keeping them this way, and so they do. 

They're essentially being blackmailed into voting for the wrong party."

worldnews,febkqdg,t1_feb86l6,1578959840.0,"You can hardly ask people who are barely making ends meet to put aside their money worries and focus on the environment.

If you created jobs in renewable energy or other environmentally friendly industries then you'd probably solve a lot of problems."

Of course, those in power know this and take full advantage of it."
worldnews,fe5vsrb,t1_fe5upxa,1578876058.0,"IIRC, people in FNQ voted for Adani because they thought that was the only way that they'd get any jobs in their region. If the government gave them literally any other viable alternatives, they'd probably have voted for those instead."

From what I've read it sounds like Cage is angry that Levin didn't try harder to stop him from wasting his money."

She hid that from us for most of our lives as well so we never knew until much later."

The therapy groups for hoarders here focus on helping people realise that their items aren't as important as they think they are."
gifs,fcox9ek,t1_fcou4tc,1577844097.0,"Thanks for your kind words :). 

I was only allowed to have friends in the yard or in the garage and nowhere else.

Never had sleepovers (obviously) but I didn't really have many friends anyway so it wasn't much of an issue. I don't think I ever felt like I missed out on much as a child, and in hindsight as an adult I realised that I had it pretty good. 

I used to try to clean up some areas when I was living there, and I was always so pleased with myself but I don't remember her noticing much. 

She did a fantastic job after I moved out, and the house looked great. It's hard to visit now and see it worse than ever. I still visit her often but I don't go inside if I can help it, and I don't mention the mess unless she brings it up. 

I feel terrible for her and I've researched places that offer support in the area but she's just not ready to deal with that yet.

We'll get there in time, I just have to wait for her to be ready."

They have to recognise that they have a problem and be willing to fix it. Not everybody is."
gifs,fcotojh,t1_fcoqrir,1577841266.0,"Absolutely. My mum's house has gotten better, and then worse again since I left. When her life was going well and she had her mental health under control she started to clean it up. Then her mother died and everything fell apart, including her mental health.

You can't just ""clean it up"", you have to address the underlying mental health issues first."
