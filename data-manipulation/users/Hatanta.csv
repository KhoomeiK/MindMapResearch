Very true. But lots of service users with learning disabilities are mobile, strong and aggressive if triggered. I knew of one service user who was notorious for battering workers, and there were warnings to staff all over his files: ""If [service user] is injured you may be prosecuted for assault, even if you were acting in self-defence."" That was enough to stop anyone directly working with him from reporting his assaults on them to the police. I made it quite clear to managers that if he were ever to assault me, I'd inform the police. Weirdly enough I was never assigned to support him. Basically the care company was trying to intimidate staff with borderline witness (pre-?)intimidation, and they got away with it.
