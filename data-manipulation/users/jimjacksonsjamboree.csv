Music,ffuy4i3,t1_ffuxihg,1580251562.0,"I understand your point but I still disagree. There has never been another shakespeare in 400 years, no other davinci in 500 years, No other Euler in 300 years, no plato/socrates/aristotle in 1500 years (they were all students of each other and are kind of like a band as far as philosophy goes). 

I highly doubt there ever be another beatles. I hope I'm wrong though, that would be great."
Music,ffuxnkk,t1_ffuvmv7,1580251305.0,"well, 7, really. First album recorded end of 1962,  last recorded in middle of 1969"
Music,ffutsda,t1_ffur8jx,1580249196.0,"I respectfully disagree. Their songwriting abilities were indescribable. Most people strive to have one hit as big as theirs, they had hundreds.

They really have only a handful of bad songs, and their bad songs are still good songs. They even gave away lots of really good songs. The greatest bands and singers of all time recorded their songs. Almost all of their songs are well known, there's only a handful that would qualify as deep-cuts, anthologies and outtakes notwithstanding (my favorite beatles deep cut is You Know my Name, Look up the Number, which was Let It Be's B-side. Almost no one has heard it, even beatles fans)

The only people to have had as big an impact as them even from a songwriting perspective are Bob Dylan, Irving Berlin, Stephen Foster and *maybe* George Gershwin, although you don't hear a lot of his songs anymore other than summertime, american in paris, and Rhapsody in Blue, but he was immensely popular for 50 years.

Then, not even considering how good their songs were structurally, they took to to the studio and mastered the art of producing.

I mean, nowadays, (and historically for that matter) a great producer is almost never writing their own material. A great performer is rarely producing their records."
Music,ffu8d90,t1_ffu2cg7,1580236635.0,"And only released albums for 8 years (1963-1970) and only recorded albums for 7 (let it be was recorded in January 1969 - 7 months BEFORE Abbey road, which was released first)

the beatles are/were amazing and there will never in a million years be another band as popular AND as a good as them (or just as popular - the only artists who have outsold them were around for much longer than them)."
todayilearned,ffk69dl,t1_ffk66js,1580017242.0,">  yet you responded 2 minutes after I posted a 9 minute long video, so you obviously didn't watch it.

I've seen it and i disagree with adam neely. He's a pretentious ass who thinks he and he alone is the judge of what makes music good.

Turning off notifications, I'm not interested in arguing with you. In my opinion its the same, you can't have a concrete answer because music is not concrete. It's the sum of many different things. Scholars have tried for millenia to define music and what makes it interesting to us and no one ever has. 

You keep linking to musicians opinions but you don't post any of your own. I don't believe you are a musician. If you were you would realize how similar they are.

As I said before, have a good night. I won't see your replies from here on out."
todayilearned,ffk66mt,t1_ffk6501,1580017172.0,It really isn't.
todayilearned,ffk5zsq,t1_ffk5wuk,1580016991.0,">  Because the style isn't what's copyrighted, and it can't be.

That makes them different songs. You aren't even following your own logic.

> The melody is the same in every style he uses.

No it's not.

> So are the lyrics.

So all he had to do was change the lyrics and he wrote 20 songs? Damn that's awesome.

> So is the chord progression (though there are some variations between them).

so...it is except when it isnt?

> how is it the same song?

Because I, in my decades of experience as a musician, say so.

Have a good evening.

Also adam neely is insufferable lol"
