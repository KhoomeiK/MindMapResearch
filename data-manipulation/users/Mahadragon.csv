HighStrangeness,ffrvytq,t1_ffn3plm,1580167093.0,"I believe there's a civilization there now. Why would they bother with Operation High Jump? Sending in nearly 5,000 troops with countless ships and aircraft would be pointless if there was nothing but frozen ice. You don't send an army to Antarctica unless there's something there to attack."

JoeRogan,ffpdy91,t1_ffiz7j8,1580092646.0,"Sanders doesn’t fire up the base. You’re talking about a 78 year old Socialist who is only leading because the other candidates look less appealing. People aren’t turning to Bernie, they’re just looking away from Biden and Warren. 

Sanders only appeals to a limited demographic. Only states he can win (as we saw from the last election) are the ones bordering Canada. He’s going to need far more than that to beat mango head."
