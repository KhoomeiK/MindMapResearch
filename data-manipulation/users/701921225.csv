introvert,ffqwsoe,t3_euf77t,1580145416.0,"No, why would that be weird? People are there to see a movie their interested in, not judge that one random person you don't even know sitting over there that you can't even see anyway because it's too dark, not to mention the giant screen in front of you is taking all your attention anyway. Going to a movie doesn't have to be a social event."
silenthill,ffqvhey,t3_eum91o,1580144568.0,"Such a disturbing track, and so fitting for the moment it plays in game. It sounds like what you would imagine is going on in James' mind at that moment."
Halloweenmovies,ffqv17y,t3_erm3ff,1580144278.0,"Ok...Rob Zombie has a good eye for visuals and lighting, but his writing is atrocious. If someone who isn't obsessed with white trash hicks would have written his Halloween films, than they could have been at least a little better, I would like to think. He's a good director, but a terrible writer."
Halloweenmovies,ffqui6v,t3_et2chz,1580143936.0,"The best Halloween fan film I've seen is ""The night he came back"" by Dave Mcrae on YouTube. He gets what a Halloween film should be, and how The Shape should be handled. It feels a LOT like the 1978 film. I loved every minute of it, and couldn't help but applaud at the end."
introvert,ffqskii,t3_eup0t4,1580142671.0,"Exactly! This is what extroverts cannot seem to understand. What is it going to take for them to get it? We are not like you, but that does not mean that we are METALLY ILL. Jeez, I'm so sick of how delusional and clueless extroverts are."
socialanxiety,ffqsbu7,t3_eupo7e,1580142509.0,"I feel you there. I had a profound moment a couple months back when my family went to Walmart...ON BLACK FRIDAY, of all days. The entire store was packed to the brim with people literally everywhere, where you can barely walk. As I was standing there waiting for the line to move, I just had this thought in my mind, ""it's amazing...even in the middle of a huge crowd of people, you still feel completely alone and isolated."""
socialanxiety,ffqrznn,t3_eul4a0,1580142288.0,"I know it. The ones who say stuff like that are the delusional extroverts who can't comprehend the fact that not everyone is like them. So when they see someone like us, they instantly assume we're mentally ill or just lazy bums. When oh when will extroverts wake up?"
silenthill,ffqrdyr,t3_euehxe,1580141886.0,"I know what you mean. I prefer psychological horror over gory nonsense any day. Not to get too personal, but I've had depression for the past year or so, and when I play Silent Hill 2, I just feel like,""wow, these people get it"". Silent Hill just has this quality to it that seems to comfort your depression, because when you're in that fog, it's like peace...there's one line in SH2 that speaks to my depression, when James is in the cemetery and says to Angela, ""I'm kind of lost"", with all the fog swirling around. The first time I saw that moment, I was like, ""that's exactly how I feel!"" 

It's as if they say to you, ""it's ok, we understand"". Silent Hill 2 in particular is basically depression personified. On a side note, I'm happy to report that my depression has decreased quite a lot over the past few months, as I believe I have finally found the source of it, and am working to fix it :)"
socialanxiety,ffqqa9m,t3_eun1x3,1580141139.0,"I hate to eat in front of ANYONE, even if they're eating too. I don't know why, but eating is something I like to do in private, as weird as that sounds. Maybe it's that I'm trying to enjoy my food, but can't because of the social anxiety. I also feel like, ""what if I'm eating something messy that will get on my mouth?"" like I feel judged and embarrassed. Also, I hate when you're sitting there trying to cut a piece of food that just won't cut, and even though no one is paying any attention to you doing that, you still feel embarrassed. You know SA is bad when you can't even eat in peace, at least around other people."
silenthill,ffieevt,t3_etswmm,1579971889.0,"I'd say go for it man, it's a fantastic game, and an experience that will stick with you. On a side note, I REALLY hope the PS5 is backwards compatible. I've heard rumors that it will be able to play games all the way back to PS1, which is amazing. That's the biggest selling point for me, as it would help me clear up some room that's currently taken up by my PS2, PS3, and PS4, with no room left for a PS5. I just wonder how that feature will work, mainly with the PS3 and 4 games, where you have to do updates. 

How will the PS5 be able to hold all that storage? Man, I miss the days when you could just pop a disc in and jump straight into the game, now you have sit through a 5 hour download. But yes, SH2 HIGHLY recommended."

TheSinkingCity,ffe8zqu,t1_ffdiojj,1579839993.0,"Really appreciate it. One more question, after you complete the story, do you have to start a new game, or does it go back into the open world? I imagine that it would have to in order for the dlc missions to appear on the map, yes?"
TheSinkingCity,ffd169b,t1_ffcziuh,1579811381.0,"Thanks for the tips man, are the fast travel points marked on the map before you find them, just so I know where to look?"
silenthill,ffayf6e,t3_er2wxd,1579747381.0,"From what I understand, Angela was originally going to have more involvement in the story, as you can see unused cutscenes of her running through a house in the game's intro. I believe that house was where she killed her father and brother. I might be mistaken, but I seem to recall hearing that Angela was even going to have her own little playable storyline like Maria's Born From A Wish, but it was cut for some reason. Shame, because it would definitely have been interesting to see."
silenthill,ffax9zm,t3_ei5wm9,1579746627.0,"Just wanted to point out that Mary didn't say James was rude, she just said he didn't laugh much. As for your theory, I think that makes a lot of sense. I mean, he's there looking for her, and he finds a bright, beaming flashlight on her dress..the flashlight itself being something else he needed to find."
silenthill,ffawlx6,t3_eskm73,1579746184.0,"Go back to third person survival horror, have a deep psychological story with symbolism, and please bring back Yamaoka to do the music."

socialanxiety,ff9l675,t3_esbzgu,1579715319.0,"The way I do it is this...the day before the interview, write down ALL the questions you may have about the job, and practice saying them in the most confident way you can muster. Also make sure you take a good shower, wash your hair, shave (if you're a guy), clip your finger nails and make sure they're clean the night before. The morning of the interview, brush your teeth, floss, and mouthwash. Have a good breakfast, get dressed in a nice, appropriate outfit for the job. If you're a guy, I would say for that job you should wear a solid color, long sleeve button up dress shirt that fits you well, a pair of dress pants that fit you well, and a pair dress shoes tat you should also shine and polish the night before. Also wear a nice belt that is the same color as your shoes. Style your hair in a neat manner. Before you leave your house, sit down, close your eyes, and take 10 deep breaths where you hold it in for 4 seconds, as this will slow down your heart rate that is probably pounding at that time. Then, stand up and stretch out your arms and legs, and hold this pose for 1 minute, it's a mental trick that supposedly makes you feel more confident. After that, jog in place for a few seconds, while shaking your arms all around, as this will help get that excess anxiety and built up energy fueling it out of your system. When you go into the interview, smile and give a good firm handshake. Get out of your head and actually try to listen to what they're saying, and ask questions if you need to. Be respectful. Also I forgot to mention, the night before, look up the most common interview questions, and write down your answers, and practice saying them. Take them with you in your pocket, as well as anything you may need for the interview like your resume. I hope this helps, and best of luck!"
socialanxiety,ff9jau8,t3_esasd5,1579714213.0,"I know what that's like. That's why I just shove it in my pocket and get the heck out of there, I'll put it in my wallet later. Also, I hate those times when you're with someone else who's shopping and paying for it, meanwhile you have to stand there awkwardly waiting with a line of people behind you while THEY try to put the money in their wallet. Sometimes I just grab the bag and walk out of the store and wait for them to come out. Better than being in that awkward scenario."
silenthill,ff7waww,t3_es4v9t,1579659886.0,"Gosh I hope so. I wonder if this is what Ito said he was working on. Knowing Konami though, they probably already cancelled it, but here's hoping. I'm going to be frank, if this is indeed true, than I hope the game is a return to the early entries like SH 1-4, with a third person view and no jump scares. As great as PT was, I was never a fan of the first person view or Lisa jump scares. Maybe even get some members from Team Silent to come back as well, and most definitely get Yamaoka to do the music if at all possible. I realize that's a pipe dream, but I'll keep my fingers crossed."
introvert,ff6p329,t3_erxp1v,1579631920.0,"Yes, definitely. I don't know what it is, but I've always had this thing where anytime everyone is laughing having a good time, in the back of my mind, I just know it won't last. I have a family that tends to have a lot of drama and occasional arguments, so whenever we get together and have one of those very rare days where things actually go smoothly enough for everyone to laugh, I just know that the very next day, it's going to go right back to the same old negativity, so I ask myself, ""what's the point?"" I wish it wasn't like this, but it is."
introvert,ff6o6zt,t3_ersx2v,1579631383.0,"If I start to say something, and the other person starts to talk, I just immediately shut my mouth and let them talk, as I can't stand when 2 people are trying to talk over each other. Also, I want to avoid sparking an argument. I prefer to remain silent anyway, so it's easy for me to stop talking :p"
introvert,ff6nguw,t3_erqh7j,1579630946.0,"Absolutely. I'm happy to be an introvert, and wouldn't dream of being yet another extrovert. I don't mean this in an egotistical or selfish manner, but when I was in high school, I never had a relationship aka girlfriend, so when I walked down the halls between classes seeing all these couples kissing at their lockers, it made me feel ""cool"" somehow. Again I want to be clear, not ""cool"" in a selfish way where I'm full of myself, or think I'm better than anyone else, but rather, I'm different, I'm not like everyone else here, I'm unique, and I like that."
socialanxiety,ff6l2t7,t3_ervusr,1579629491.0,"I totally understand, but over time I've learned a valuable lesson in dealing with this. Simply put, stop caring what people think of you  (easier said than done, I know). Just be yourself, and stop catering to their expectations. If they don't like something about you, than too bad. However, do realize that there is valuable feedback as well, such as someone saying ""you shouldn't smoke"", in those cases, take their feedback seriously. If it's something like, ""I don't like the way you dress"", than ignore it. Learn to realize you are not here to please people, just please yourself."
findapath,ff6ihq4,t3_er3fbb,1579627916.0,"I'm 22 and completley understand. I still haven't figured it out. The uncertainty combined with seeing others my age having success after success lead to my depression. Haven't even found a decent job yet. As a glimmer of hope however, I recently read about this concept of 2 types of people...early bloomers, and late bloomers.

I would be considered a late bloomer, for example. Early bloomers are those who succeed in school, graduate with honors and numerous awards, and think they have it all figured out. They jump straight into things, and sooner or later, due to having their peak so early in life, burn out. Meanwhile, late bloomers have to go through a long struggle to figure everything out when they're young, having the advantage over early bloomers of finding out who they really are as a person, thus developing character and eventually leading to success later in life, so their best days are always ahead of them. There is hope."
silenthill,ff3fpo8,t1_ff39akn,1579540115.0,"From what I've heard, they wanted to do a story that was somehow even darker than Silent Hill 2's story, if that's even possible. I would have loved to have seen what they had planned, but unfortunately, they said a lot of people wanted a sequel to the first game, so that whole idea was tossed in favor of what we ultimately got with Silent Hill 3 as we know it today."
silenthill,ff3ekn8,t1_ff3e0te,1579539479.0,"I know man, I have never in my life encountered a game that outright refuses to leave your mind more than Silent Hill 2. Heck, I even had a dream where one of the prison level's music tracks was playing."
silenthill,ff3bpsx,t3_erer8t,1579538029.0,"Silent Hill 2, without question. Silent Hill 3 is a solid entry, but it just never really felt like Silent Hill to me, like it's not ""psychological"" enough for my taste. On top of that, I prefer the character of James, as I don't like how Heather doesn't always seem to take the whole situation seriously, such as the boss fight with Leonard, where she wise cracks and practically winks to the camera. When I think of Silent Hill, my mind instantly goes to Silent Hill 2. I vastly prefer the overall atmosphere of SH2, and the somber, depressing mood it has, whereas SH3 is all in your face.

The soundtrack is fantastic, and easily my favorite in the series as well, though I will say SH3 also has a few good tracks. I've also never been a fan of the whole cult, religious plotlines in Silent Hill,(always felt it was too heavy handed, over the top, cheesy, gimmicky and uncecessary) another reason I prefer SH2, as it's a far more personal story. Another element I like about SH2 that adds to the creepiness is Maria, because when you realize that she isn't even real, just a manifestation that could defined as a ""demon"" (which are known to disguise themselves as innocent little girls, from what I understand), there's just something about being deep in the bowels of that dark, deserted hospital with her by your side every step of the way, feeling comfortable that at least you're not alone, yet she's probably the worst ""monster"" in the game, without you even realizing it at the time. It still amazes me that Team Silent took SH2 seriously enough to do all this research and craft this incredible story full of symbolism that holds up to this day. It's so simple in it's approach, yet that's exactly what makes it so terrifying, the little things, like the footsteps behind you in the prison courtyard. Even more amazing...no jumpscares necessary.

Man, I miss Team Silent. It's so sad we don't have anyone like them making horror games today."
silenthill,fewij1e,t3_eql1l2,1579411239.0,"Yeah man, all those videos are great. I have never encountered a franchise that begs you to dig deeper into it's symbolism and meaning more than Silent Hill."
silenthill,fepdtsv,t1_fep6lfm,1579318052.0,"Yeah, I hear you. I've been on the fence ever since it came out because purely based on the trailers and interviews about what the developers were going for with this game, I was reeled in instantly. I love the atmosphere, the setting, and the psychological fear of the unknown elements it has, but the actual ""game"" part is just underwhelming. It's really sad too, because now that Team Silent is no longer with us, you never really see games like this being made anymore, so anytime something even remotely like a Silent Hill 2 comes along, you have to take notice. I just wish there was another game out there similar to this that's actually good, but sadly, most ""horror"" games these days are first person with cheap jumpscares."
silenthill,fep2sqa,t3_eq0o3r,1579310861.0,"That makes a lot of sense, actually. What's interesting is it's a dream meaning...something that seems very much in line with Silent Hill. Makes you wonder if the developers were inspired by it. Otherwise, I'd say it was done because there's just something unsettling about seeing this tall, skinny woman with a disturbing face just wearing one shoe. It's a small, subtle detail that just adds to her overall creepiness, deeper meaning or not."
silenthill,fenvons,t3_dyqzub,1579291630.0,"That's true! If I recall correctly, the Silent Hill book of memories sites Lost Highway as one of the influences/inspirations the team had for Silent Hill 2, and the whole plot element of the guy killing his wife, and not realizing it until he watches a video tape makes that incredibly obvious."
introvert,felnhp8,t3_eps7oo,1579226399.0,"So true, OP. I get so tired of hearing extroverts who say ""get out of your shell"", ""deal with it"", or ""get over it"". They act like you have some disease or mental disorder, simply because you are not mentally wired the same way they are. Extroverts need to wake up and realize that not everyone was born an extrovert like they were...yes, there is such thing as an ""introvert"". Shocking, I know. It's basically the equivalent of telling a crippled person in a wheelchair to get up and walk like everyone else."
socialanxiety,fekv1yl,t3_epf8m2,1579208188.0,"I went through a group interview a few months ago for a call center job (I was desperate) that I thankfully did not get hired for. It's definitely an uncomfortable position to be in, but in my case, the vast majority of the time, the person meeting us did the talking. Only occasionally asking each person a question like, ""what are your skills for this job?"" or ""how would you handle this situation?"". I must admit, those questions can easily put you on the spot, and if you're not careful, your mind can go blank, leading to a super awkward moment where you don't know what to say while everyone else looks at you, thus making you feel like they're judging you, thinking you're strange for not knowing what to say...you know, basic social anxiety stuff we all suffer with. In those moments, I was just straight up honest and said something along the lines of ""I'm not sure"", or ""I'm sorry, but I don't understand thee question"". 

It was humiliating, especially since everyone else there was more qualified and experienced than I was, and had no issues answering any of the questions. Of course, that was all my own experience for a call center job, while yours is for a stocking job in a store, not to sound derogatory, but I would imagine the questions would be more simple to answer. In any case, I wish you the best of luck."
introvert,fej1ck3,t3_en5y83,1579153362.0,"I know exactly what you mean. I hate being in any situation that puts you on the spot, with all eyes and attention on you. No one likes going to the dentist, but I find that it helps if I just look straight up at the ceiling and basically ignore the person working on my teeth. It's even better when they give you the gas to relax you, but the most embarrassing thing is when the bright light makes your eyes burn and start watering profusely with tears. As for the barber, my biggest problem is the fact the barber chairs face the people sitting and waiting.

It's just so awkward to be sitting there with your hair being worked on while people sit there looking at you. Luckily there are newspapers and magazines, so sometimes that can help. Other than that, my barbershop is pretty old school and laid back. My barber doesn't really say anything other than the basic ""how do you want it?"" and ""thanks, see you next time"".  I find the barber to be relaxing though, especially when there's no one there waiting across form you. Just the sounds and sensations can be soothing.

The thing that really makes me sad is the fact that every time I go to the barber, before I get there, my heart is pounding from anxiety, yet by the time I'm in the middle of the haircut, the anxiety is gone, and I'm just thinking,"" I can't believe I get anxiety over this"" but I can't help it. The fact that you know you have to go every few weeks makes it worse. Given the choice however, I'd rather go to the barber than the dentist any day."
socialanxiety,fe6j73r,t3_enujao,1578892623.0,"Oh my gosh yes. I have SA and depression, and I've noticed that when I talk with someone, even loved ones, not always, but there are indeed times where I feel very much the way you described. It's like there's nothing there...no connection, I don't know how to describe it, but you just feel like something's missing. Like I feel empty from the depression, so I have nothing to give in the way of true emotion, if you know what I mean, and on top of that is the social anxiety and introversion that drives me to avoid socializing. It's sad, because I don't want to feel this way, especially when it's with loved ones."
socialanxiety,fe6i2b3,t3_entdnb,1578891563.0,"As a fellow SA sufferer who's spent over a year struggling to figure out what job would be best suited for me, I can tell you from experience that the best thing to do is never apply for any job that you know from the get go you won't like. A few months ago, I was so desperate for a job that I actually applied for a call center job. I thought, ""well at least it's in a cubicle, and not face to face"". After the interview, I knew in my heart that I made a mistake, so when they contacted me a week later and told me I didn't get the job, I was relieved. I now regret the day I applied for that job in the first place. 

On a side note, if you are truly interested in pursuing an IT job or career, I'm not sure if thee's one near you, but try to attend a trade school if they provide a course on the subject. Where I'm at, you only have to attend 1 year or a little over. Do what feels right for you."
