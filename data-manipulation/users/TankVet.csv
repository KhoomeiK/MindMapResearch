MurderedByWords,fc337lz,t3_efx2jn,1577380383.0,"A few years ago, my girlfriend found a deer on the side of the road that had been hit by a car. The deer wasn’t dead and, being veterinarians, we thought we should do something to end the animal’s suffering. 

We were going to euthanize it with drugs, but then we’re afraid to introduce those drugs into the environment. So we called the police and asked them to shoot the deer. 

There is a “best” way to kill an animal with a firearm, and we described it to the police officer. 

He missed. And hit the deer in the neck. The deer didn’t die, but now also had a gunshot wound in the neck.

The cop left. Leaving this animal dying not that much faster on the side of the road.

So there’s a section in the AVMA guidelines on euthanasia on religious killing of animals for halal or kosher meat. I’d read it out of curiosity at some point. It’s done with a cut to the neck, high and fast and deep so as to not only sever the major blood vessels, but also down to the cranial nerves. It’s considered to be humane.

I wasn’t willing to leave this deer to die slowly and I don’t own a gun. So I took a hunting knife I keep in the car and performed the euthanasia as it’s described.

I’d like to believe that the guy in this tweet had as good a reason as I did to kill to an animal that way. But out of context it’s hard to know."
