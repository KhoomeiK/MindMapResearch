There are six routes in total, each with a different theme and catered to different skill sets. From the Family Certified Route to the Steep Sampler, these tours offer all the adventure of finding your way on your own with the guidance to make sure you don’t miss out. When you get fresh snow, make sure to try the Powder Stashes route– you’ll feel just like a local as you make your way to untracked runs.
