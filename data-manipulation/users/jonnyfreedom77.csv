gay,fg1v1to,t1_fg1tyyx,1580433624.0,"Well, that’s sweet anyway."
gay,fg1skdb,t1_fg1m687,1580432575.0,Did she call?
ipad,ffyhg5j,t1_ffxfrc2,1580346516.0,"Just googled it, albeit on my phone so it wasn’t a formal search. But, they may have streamlined it, but this caught my eye: “In countries and regions with consumer law protections, users retain their rights under these protections”.  I know most countries, but **not** the United States have much stronger consumer protections."
TheSimpsons,ffy6jds,t1_ffxv6q3,1580339519.0,"Ah, I see you’ve played Knify Spoony!"
ipad,ffxk2h3,t1_ffxfrc2,1580326729.0,Sure thing!
ipad,ffxfklq,t1_ffxdohv,1580324139.0,"Just curious - you’re not in the US, I assume? Cause in the States it’s damn near impossible to refund an app. Are you country’s laws different?  Great penmanship, by the way!"
gratefuldead,ffx4nbz,t3_evmfq3,1580317661.0,Can’t stop staring!  What legends.
stephenking,ffvkd78,t1_ffvj35i,1580266165.0,"2nd Libby!  And, you can associate multiple library cards, which is good because different libraries have a different selection.  For example, I have my own Public Library, as well as a card from Brooklyn Public Library. 

Edit: I forgot a sentence."
logodesign,ffvhe9b,t3_evf62f,1580264163.0,Very clever!
stephenking,ffe440h,t3_esyvnb,1579836188.0,"Ugh, really wouldn’t advise you to read that in flu season!  Just kidding, great book. Enjoy!"
bipolar,ffe3z48,t1_ffe05gx,1579836087.0,"I hate to say it, but I feel exactly the same way, right now."
bipolar,ffcvtj6,t1_ffcnaew,1579808314.0,Yeah. Join the club. Grrrrr!
bipolar,ff7nyex,t1_ff7niv9,1579654103.0,"Don’t sell yourself short, friend!  Creativity takes many forms."
bipolar,ff4q82w,t3_erl770,1579569816.0,The Grateful Dead. And bjork.
bipolar,ff2wsyf,t3_er7zw9,1579527084.0,That’s really pretty. I’m never getting going to get a tattoo so I live vicariously through you guys!  Have a great day.
gratefuldead,ff20llm,t1_ff1z0l8,1579490616.0,"Including 3 members of that greatest band, so it’s far from a “tribute band”.   And a stain on the legacy? C’mon man!  Are the shows expensive?  Yeah. Do you have to go?  No!  There’s a shit ton of music they’re still putting out from the archives. So, kick back and listen to the Grateful Dead.  Or maybe it’s folks like you that are a stain on the legacy?"
bipolar,ff13k7k,t1_ff0xdzy,1579474844.0,"Seems pretty fool proof. I’m inept when it comes to cooking. Part impatience - why cook when I can microwave!?  But I’m also broke and there’s something to be said for a home cooked meal, even if it’s just pasta!  Thanks for the recipe. Saved. :)"
bipolar,ff0ux67,t3_eqyllb,1579472500.0,"Oh, that looks sick!  Easy recipe?  I’m looking into cooking for myself more.    (And I looooove bacon)!"
gay,few3vx5,t1_fevrrgj,1579404982.0,"Wait, sounds like you mean your dads inanimate?  Lol. Mine is too!"
bipolar,fev2mxx,t3_eqgb0i,1579392438.0,"That was a lovely thing to read. I’ve basically given up on my family members understanding though. They can be compassionate but they see things differently.  You’re right, they have their own issues, but the lack of any real interest in the illness is ultimately on them. I just hope they understand before it’s too late. Thanks for what you wrote, though. It was succinct and eloquent. Have a great night!"
stephenking,fep81z0,t3_eq6p0d,1579314225.0,Thrumming.
logodesign,feo71gd,t1_feo3pqj,1579295940.0,Yea. That took me awhile!  Really cool though.
stephenking,fejt7of,t1_fejjwpf,1579185266.0,Nice!
stephenking,feivv1b,t1_fehjae7,1579148619.0,"Great choice. I love the Bill Hodges trilogy. Mr. Mercedes won a mystery award, I think. Too tired to check but maybe someone can fact-check me."
stephenking,feit6bz,t3_epafv7,1579146557.0,I love it. What software did you use?
AmericanHorrorStory,fei1w77,t1_fehqjcx,1579128471.0,"You mean big heels, right?"
addiction,fefyi7h,t1_feft3gy,1579069525.0,"That’s tricky, but it sounds like your giving your sponsor too much power?"
gratefuldead,fefoeu2,t3_eoutb5,1579060812.0,I am so sorry for your loss. Birdsong gives me a lot of solace when I’m down and out: “Dry your eyes on the wind”.
bipolar,fef97cy,t1_fef738c,1579051155.0,"Well, sorry to spoil it, if you don’t know: The author - [Kay Redfield Jamison](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Redfield_Jamison)  - is an accomplished psychologist who just happens to have a wee bit of bipolar. It’s an amazing read and a book I turn to again and again. Congrats on the PhD. Makes me think maybe some day being a grocery clerk isn’t my only lot in life!"
AmericanHorrorStory,fef8aru,t1_fef7b90,1579050549.0,"Oh, ain’t that kind."
AmericanHorrorStory,feeyiwu,t1_feeex4b,1579044024.0,What’s kys?
AmericanHorrorStory,feedcfp,t3_eomcwa,1579031419.0,"That’s so cool. Maybe you can do a Evan Peters from each season, just so I can drool a bit. ;)"
gratefuldead,fedeeq1,t3_eofqsy,1579009224.0,Just lovely!  Just what I needed this morning. Congrats!
addiction,fedczbs,t1_fecmxxc,1579008000.0,"Thanks so much!  I haven’t experienced that pink cloud, though I have in the past. (This ain’t my first rodeo)!"
addiction,fechid6,t1_febftzt,1578974048.0,"Ya know, I’ve been using a bit of your suggestion, although it was probably made by someone else. That it will be infinitely harder tomorrow than it is today. I’m about 7, 8 or 9 days off of Kratom. I can’t pinpoint it because I spent the balance of the last week and a half with a GI bug and was laid up for dayyyysssss. But I’m up and about and digesting again. Lol. If I could get off Gabapentin then I’d be truly clean, but I’m proud of myself. Anyway, I’m rambling and hijacking this thread so I’ll stop. OP, though, this is sound advice. It *will* be harder tomorrow - do it today. Peace."
bipolar,feceozy,t1_fe8pitj,1578972134.0,Great to hear!
AppleWatch,fecc9cb,t1_febr7dv,1578970579.0,Just downloaded it. So cool!
bipolar,fe3sh6w,t3_enqdke,1578852455.0,"I hadn’t slept in 2 months, started climbing trees in my yard, kicked my best friend out of my house, burned a cd full of art files and hid them under my neighbors deck and periodically would black out for days at a time."
bipolar,fe3d684,t3_enpbqb,1578848229.0,I can share my bootstraps any time. Sending you my best wishes and you can (eventually!) turn this around. You got this!
bipolar,fdzz9yo,t1_fdzyrwd,1578799360.0,"Thanks. I need to book an appointment anyway. We have tried some of the Alzheimer’s drugs (namenda, aricept) but I got ill from them. He’s really aware of side effects and tries to negate them when he can."
bipolar,fdzxb2o,t1_fdzepl2,1578798060.0,I’ve been on lamictal for years and I have zero memory retention. It’s abysmal. I never linked the two though. Maybe worth bringing up with my psychiatrist?
bipolar,fdwm6mm,t3_en1nb9,1578760131.0,"Man, I could look at this for hours. Keep it up. Don’t bottle up your talent!"
kindle,fdsbn85,t3_emxl2h,1578698890.0,"Love Joe Hill!  Enjoy. (His Dad is pretty good, too)."
bipolar,fd7crpc,t3_ek5nm7,1578202467.0,Well done!
