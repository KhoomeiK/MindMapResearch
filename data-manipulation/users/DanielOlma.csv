I'm guessing the case is nylon (not the zipper material). You can heat a nail and press the nail through the material if it is and it will melt the fibers together and leave a hole. I'd hammer the nail through first then run the hot nail through. 
Try that first as you will need a hole for the grommet anyway. 
Good luck!"

String some parachute line through the hole and tie the ends together so that when you close the case and zip it up, it creates a handle along the spine. You can also add loops to clip carabiners to it."

With excel you won't have access to analytics but if they copy the file and select what they want, it would not be hard to take a third tab and use that for analytics especially if all sales files are stored in the same drive (or a copy of them) organized by month. Then you could grab each spread sheet and combine the data with some VBA. 

What you are looking to do WILL save time and is doable. Just research more. 
Let me know if you need more help with this. 

BTW, there is probably better software out there that can do what you are looking to do. It's probably not that expensive and the learning curve is probably not that bad."

insanepeoplefacebook,fcl0970,t1_fckw5jc,1577736999.0,"Right? I mean it is just an address. 
I think it is more because the homeless represent people that make poor choices, are undisciplined, have mental issues, or are simply less intelligent than there non-homeless counterparts. Homeless people have one or more of these undesirable traits and people tend not to want to associate with those individuals. Furthermore the hatred for these people is expanded when property values are depreciated, the general environment is destroyed by discarded trash and other stuff, etc. 
It sucks that there is a hatred for the homeless but the truth is that no one likes them. They don't want them in their community and people generally don't invite them into their homes to get them to transition to non-homeless, more successful people."

insanepeoplefacebook,fckqrg2,t3_ehmggy,1577731162.0,"Immigrants assimilate into a culture where as the pioneers had no plans to assimilate. The largest difference is the rate at which immigrants are taken in. People do not like change and will hold to a previous culture. Immigrants need to be taken in at a rate that allows the immigrant to learn the new culture. Dispersing those immigrants over the entire populace helps. But in the end the victors write the history. 
If the Indians were organized enough in the US to do this and new americans were assimilated into this culture, we might have a different story today."
