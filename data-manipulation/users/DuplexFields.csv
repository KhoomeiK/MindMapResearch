I remember having fifteen TV Trope tabs open in those heady early days. I was learning so much about the art of storytelling hooks and subverting expectations.

Web Originals was my favorite category.

- It led me to Iji, an indy video game with a vast and terrifyingly personal story about an alien invasion; because of Iji’s explicitly atheist story and soundtrack, I found my Christian faith renewed through a dream.
- It led me to Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, a fanfiction designed your teach people *how* to think; this eventually led me to r/rational and then to Worm, an absolutely engrossing web serial novel about superheroes and a girl whose high school classmates’ bullying ends up saving the human race. This renewed my love of long form fiction.
- It led me to RubyQuest, the original interactive quest, which took over my mind at a time of deep depression and helped me resolve some issues I didn’t know I had. This led me to 4chan, where I learned how to lurk moar and grow a thick skin. Somehow I didn’t visit the Cartoons and Comics board until November 2010, where I was told I *had* to watch My Little Pony. And it was there that my life changed forever. My depression lifted like a curtain, joy was once again possible. 90% of my autism symptoms went away as I learned from young fictional women (who happened to be colorful livestock) how relationships function and can be fixed. I went back to school and got my degree. (If it wasn’t for My Little Pony, I would never have spent that semester in college. Props to Lewis Black.) I found a job, the longest lasting I’ve ever had. I’ve had enough philosophical insights to fill two books.
