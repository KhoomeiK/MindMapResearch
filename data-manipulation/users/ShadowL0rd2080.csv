deadbydaylight,ff82fo1,t1_ff825cl,1579664218.0,"Matchmaking. The rule for matchmaking states that when searching for a match, you get paired with someone exactly your rank. If there is no one available, it keeps going to the next highest or lowest until it finds a proper match. HOWEVER, this only goes up to a max of 6 ranks above or below. So my question is this: how am I, a rank 9, being paired with a rank 1? According to their rules, that shouldn't be possible."
