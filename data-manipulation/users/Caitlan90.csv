We don't go to practices, just games. The athletic trainers do like the practices. We're mostly only there to transport injuries. 

But even though there's a very high chance he's an emt or paramedic, there's really nothing he could do without equipment. Basically the only thing he could do would be cpr or hold their neck if he suspects a spinal injury. The athletic trainers have the tape and ice and they can splint.

So there's no way that I can see him being there for medical purposes. I thought it was because he's trying to relive his glory days lol but who knows

Hope this helps :)"

newtothenavy,fezff48,t1_fezdr06,1579456793.0," No I didn't end up going to meps because I had a family emergency and had to back out. But I was very upfront with my recruiter about going to therapy and he said it was fine. I even told him why i was going and it was because i was having a hard time and needed someone to talk to. He never said lie about it or anything. He just moved on and made it seem like a non issue. 

Now I don't know if my cousin lied about it but he was also going because he was having a hard time. He went to meps and and left a couple months later with no issue

Both recruiters made it seem like a non issue because neither us took meds"
newtothenavy,fez8n3v,t3_eqz4cq,1579454856.0,When i was working with the recruiter (this was marines as a disclaimer) I told him I was actively in therapy and he said that's fine as long as there's no meds.

How you described that girl, was exactly how I was when I lost interest in a girl. Before/after the first date I sent all the romatic texts and initiated contact.

I thought I was just stressed but really I just didn't like her. Once I realized that I called it off. I know it's not the answer you wanna hear but it's my experience.
