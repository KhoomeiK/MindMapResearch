snakes,fgnjpvc,t1_fgnit9c,1580946295.0,"Ha same. Still not entirely sure what it actually was - seemed too long to be mouse hairs, and didn't look like my hair. If i were you I'd either leave it or be very gentle when pulling it, just to be safe, in case it's longer and caught further up. If there's an resistance I'd just leave it and see what happens."
snakes,fgnip8d,t3_ezin2r,1580945701.0,"My snake's had that. I assume it was either attached to something she ate or some hair that managed to get stuck there whilst she was moving about. Either way, I pulled it very gently and it came out."

thanksimcured,fgjd14p,t3_ey7jc5,1580841486.0,"That was genuinely the 'advice' from the teachers at my school. First, come out because if you don't then the blatant homophobic bullying isn't really homophobic because they don't know if you're gay or not, then once you've come out just be less gay because that's obviously why they're doing it.

vegetarian,fgi8xry,t3_eyo1nf,1580811835.0,"Just look up some basic balanced vegetarian meals. Eat whole foods, with lots of grains and pulses and veg - don't just replace meat with fake meat, expecting everything to be fine with the rest if the meal exactly the same, and you'll be fine, especially for only 40 days. Have fun with it! :)"
AskMen,fghaepz,t3_eyhjwz,1580780405.0,"Not really being sure that everyone genuinely wants to/chose to be there, just generally getting distracted by thinking about how grim the industry is, completely hairless bodies, fake pleasure.. Yeah, I think that porn just isn't really for me tbh."
houseplants,fgh3knm,t3_eyf920,1580775870.0,"Mine's on a crowded gravel tray a foot or two from the window, shaded by other plants. The room is always fairly cool. I don't water it often, especially as it's winter, so only once or twice a month really, and it's doing well. Maybe something in that would help yours?"

YouShouldKnow,fggy3q3,t1_fggx955,1580772170.0,Telling them it's on in the house doesn't necessarily mean telling then where it is.
