It's like they pulled the wool over our eyes with the excuses as to why the full national dex could not be included, just to announce an expansion pass that will almost certainly introduce them all over time.

My Dad taught me to ski at age 6 or so, and we were on the slopes every weekend in the winter. Neither of us ever wore a helmet. I fell out of the sport for a few years and got back into it around 2004. By then, eeeeeeveryone was wearing a helmet. I went out and bought one the next day.  
  
Not only are ski helmets safe, they weigh practically nothing and you kind of forget it's there after a few minutes. It keeps your head and ears pretty warm too!
