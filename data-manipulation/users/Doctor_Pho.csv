Eh I kind of disagree with this notion. There are a lot of fragile people, I agree. But disagreeing with someone making fun of a group doesn't inherently mean you're part of the group being made fun of. You're allowed to think something is bad even if it's not directed at you.

Otherwise it's like a catch-22/self-fulfilling prophecy and there's no way for someone to dispute without the statement."
FragileWhiteRedditor,fgm542g,t1_fgln1ie,1580918157.0,"Saw this pop up in r/all. Depends how they complain. If they get defensive, it proves the point of the sub. But a lot of people confuse disagreeing with being defensive that's the problem. Otherwise, it's a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't situation."

Just with your last sentence, I want to make sure it's clear that not wanting to give oral doesn't mean you aren't interested in your partner's sexual gratification."
blursedimages,fgm1ir1,t1_fgm0jzb,1580916044.0,"That's really the key, communicate.

If your partner doesn't want to give oral, that's fine. So in that regard, I don't think he was wrong. I *do* think he was wrong for expecting you to give oral to him. Now if you still enjoyed it, that's fine, whatever.

But that's where you explore other avenues of stimulation, like hands, or as you mentioned, toys, etc. I just really have a problem with people who either expect oral but don't want to give it (in the case of that guy), or expect oral just because they gave it.

Really you should just never expect or feel entitled to it, regardless of who you are."

blursedimages,fglzb5o,t1_fgljz06,1580914586.0,"I think it's ""Good sex partners sometimes give oral sex"" but it's important to respect people who don't like to give oral. Not giving oral doesn't inherently make you a bad partner. Some people (like my current SO) are uncomfortable or don't like certain sexual acts, and that's okay. No one is obligated to give oral, not even if their partner gives it to them."
pics,fglye1v,t1_fglxnsr,1580913958.0,"Why does an 80 year old turning into a zombie suddenly make their muscles increase in mass and their bones less brittle?

Also, why are we assuming three kills per zombie? And you're only talking about the influx of zombies. What about all the zombies killed? 150,000 people die a day, but if everyone still alive negates one zombie (shooting, running over with a car, smashing head in, trapping), that's going to be a net negative in zombie population.

If it's Christmas with 20 family members and 2 zombies come in, then that's 2 dead zombies with 0 dead family members."

BlackPeopleTwitter,fgkva2s,t1_fgkn63g,1580874407.0,Public transportation & ride share into the city. City rent is so expensive because it's in such high demand for convenience and proximity - city homes/apartments/condos are a luxury.

Also, 50 is in no way ""ideal."" It's just a percentage of a range. Humidity isn't most comfortable at 50% either, especially depending on the accompanying temperature.

As for precision, it's not about estimating how you feel in that moment. A lot of weather channels use 2 significant figures (even when temperatures get to triple digits), as one (but not the only) example."

facepalm,fgfzkjo,t1_fgfz3kz,1580751028.0,"It's just a way to describe a temperature.

0-100°C covers all three phases of water at 1 atm (101.3 kPa), so you can accurately describe how hot or cold water is by a percentage on a scale from 0 to 100.

0-100°F covers the range of temperatures at which most humans live on Earth, so you can express the temperature in percentage of min to max for how hot/cold it feels outside.

Obviously it's all relative with climate acclimation (50°F feels a lot warmer to someone from Canada than someone from Mexico), but it's a way to explain it.

So for me, if it's 72°F right now, it's 72% of the ""max"" of human-inhabited climate. I use ""max"" loosely here because some climates reach into 120+ occasionally. Also, obviously temperatures drop below 0°F as well."
