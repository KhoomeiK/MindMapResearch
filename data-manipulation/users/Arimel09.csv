Not trying to scare you or say you’re wrong, just to inform you but no one really plans on becoming alcoholics and ruining what they have just like people with any other disease. However, the earlier you can stop yourself, the better and it is okay if you need help or support from others in order to do so."
trashy,ffb7ou7,t1_ffb6hpv,1579754158.0,It doesn’t matter if you have too much to live for or not. You should read Bill’s story in the AA book.

Msstate,ff2ae15,t1_feu0gxu,1579498605.0,"I know one of the people that is over that program here at state and she’s super nice! I also interviewed for a scholarship here and it went well mostly because  I knew that they were looking to see what my personality was and if I was passionate about the program itself. If you can show that, you should be fine!"
