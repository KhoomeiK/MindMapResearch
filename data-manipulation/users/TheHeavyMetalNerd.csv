Fantasy,feprxb3,t1_feon6vx,1579329215.0,"I disagree personally. I'm honestly kinda sick of the Planet Destroying Superweapon trope and wasn't  a fan of how it was executed in TFA. It feels like something that should have remained the signature of the Original Trilogy thematically and execution wise there's really nowhere left to go with it.

ANH revolved around the first Death Star and it's overwhelming power and ROTJ was based around the fear of the second one. Both of them were central to the plot and tone of both movies.

The one from TFA (I legitimately can't recall the name of it off the top of my head, which in my opinion says something about how poorly done it was) comes out of nowhere and despite being far more powerful than both Death Stars combined lacks the emotional impact or horror of either. Honestly, I don't believe it added anything to the movie at all other than being a blatant reference back to the originals.

And even if they did somehow come up with a plausible reason for a FOURTH planet buster weapon there's really no way to make it seem impactful. The first Death Star blew up Alderaan as a way to torture Leia, whom the audience was already invested in, and then the remainder of the movie was about it's imminent threat against the entire Rebellion. The second Death Star only blew up a few Rebellion battleships, but it was equally as terrifying as the first because of what it represented.

The Force Awakens weapon blows up a BUNCH of planets all at once with no warning, but there's no emotional impact behind it because we're given no reason to care about the planets destroyed or anybody on them.

So where does that leave us for a 5th weapon? You can't go back to a single planet killer because then it would feel like a downgrade and less of a threat, and you can't go up in scale because what's the difference between blowing up 10 planets or 100 planets?

I just don't see a way to make people CARE about Planet Busters anymore because by now they're formulaic. They make a dramatic entrance display that otherwise doesn't affect the plot significantly and then the rest of the movie is a desperate race against time to destroy it before it fires again. They're the equivalent of the improv taboo of pulling a gun in a scene; it immediately shoots the scene to the highest tension possible and removes any room to explore.

Sorry for the wall of text and hope I didn't rain on your parade too much, this has just been bugging me since TFA and I needed to get if off my chest."

DMAcademy,fekmf17,t1_fekjnk8,1579203081.0,"A bit pendantic but those 6-8 ""encounters"" don't HAVE to be combat. Just anything that drains the players resources. So for example a puzzle that requires the wizard to use some utility spells or a race against the clock that makes the fighter use his Second Wind would also count."
