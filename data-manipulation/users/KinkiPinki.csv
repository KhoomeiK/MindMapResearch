fatlogic,fffj8zm,t3_etbmyx,1579885146.0,"I'm so sick of people telling me I'm starving myself. I'm intermittent fasting 18-6 and people at my work are convinced I'm starving to death. I eat a ton of healthy food in my window. But I literally got criticized for eating healthy. I broke my fast with a meal that was: cauliflower rice, kale, spinach, artichoke heart, a vegan sausage, and mozzarella. It was so good and someone told me, ""you cant survive on that"" I told them it was over 300 calories with the olive oil. The responded with,"" but there is no bread?!? You need grains!"""

You're upset. And that's okay.


Move on and find someone new. Just a sucky situation."

sex,ff8ymck,t1_ff8vtu8,1579700224.0,That doesn't mean anything. It got out out on Twitter. Anyone could have that video. Break it off with him. Report him to the police. That's disgusting behavior and he will repeat it.
Advice,ff8y7v7,t3_esb1vn,1579699895.0,"Daughter of a teacher. And I manage an elementary. Being a teacher is a hard and often unrewarding job. For ever nice word from a parent there are three bad from another. My mom deals constantly with parents yelling at her, downtown taking money from the budget away and coworkers that can be rough. 


The best thing you can do is to listen. Ask questions really try to relax her mind and understand her issues. She spends all day hearing and having bad experiences. She likely needs to vent. 


Next take her out. Have a nice dinner or go to a bar. Take her to a movie or bowling. The best way I relax my mother is by working out and shopping with her. If I buy her coffee it is her whole week. 


I'm sorry she feels bad and you struggle to make her feel better. But as the years go on she will get better just be understanding."

Advice,fd3b5qn,t3_ejwdgb,1578156506.0,"I get that a friendship can make you hesitate. But her being so much younger than you means in her mind, her relationship with you is already deeper than you should be comfortable with. She has to have time to process the relationship. It may take years.

Block her and move on. This could continue to be toxic for her if you don't."

sex,fc6bqkl,t1_fc58hlf,1577476860.0,If op isnt having any communication about what they like or dont like outside of heat with their SO then yes talk.  But it was OP's birthday. It's not expected but any considerate SO would know that at minimum you should get your partner off.
