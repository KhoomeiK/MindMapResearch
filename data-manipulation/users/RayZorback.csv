With so many artists & artistic “spreads” in this sub I thought many would find it interesting to see the progression of someone creating a spread in their own journal. I think the OPs text sums it up:
“Inspiration”.

I’m not even an artist and I have doodle spreads. I find it increases my productivity and enjoyment of bullet journaling. 

Just imagine they added the word “January” if that makes you feel better. 
Or maybe this is the start of a specific a collection? Who knows?"

Might be a dumb question but ... how are y’all painting in your bullet journals and it’s not going through?? I feel like I can barely use a marker without messing up the back of that page. What am I missing?"

bulletjournal,fejv814,t3_epcyzr,1579186621.0,"It takes me months to finish some pages. I use lit like my doodling. In the meantime I’m filling up the daily logs and notes with great content that matters to me. 
Don’t get bogged down in the design. I enjoy the designing but the main purpose is productivity. As long as you are still using it for that, design all the cool things you want. 

This is a rad look. That key and the shading in the curves is on point. I’m working hard to be more artistic."
