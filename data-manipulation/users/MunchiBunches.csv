dogpictures,ffkr8sh,t3_eu3p8b,1580027476.0,"Lol I love that you can't see his eyes. This is the best bandwagon though. I would not mind seeing this format for the rest of my life. I feel like I get to know everyone's dogs'personalities through this. I made mine and I struggled so much with the tinder one because I had a photo that made Munchkin look seductive and another that made her look cute. She makes a bunch of expressions so I really wanted to capture that in this weird dolly parton thing. 

Aaah everyone's dogs are so cute!

Edit: I honestly can't tell the gender--sorry if its a she. I spent too much time zooming in on a dog's genitals."

HumansBeingBros,fex3qcd,t1_fex3flu,1579423792.0,The company (Timberland) that makes all these really cool men's-and recently a lot more women's- but mainly men's sturdy boots. They've also got clothes too. It's all very nice and makes me wish I was larger because I'm a small female and don't fit into a lot of the styles they have.
Pomeranians,fex34is,t3_eqtrjm,1579423519.0,GAH! This is a work of art. Yes. This is one of those photos you find framed while shopping at like aGood Will or Savers and you put it on display proudly in your kitchen/living room.

If it tastes the same then it might be cuz you're using some poopoo quality water that overpowers the taste of any tea.

manga,fdtry4t,t1_fdtpikb,1578721268.0,"I don't know too much about manga, but I was looking into just landing a job in Japan being a foreigner (I'm approaching university graduation). I think you have to be employed somewhere for 5 years before you can become a Japanese citizen (just a side note). Anyways, what I've come to understand is that your best chance is getting a university degree (3-4 years), becoming an English teacher in Japan (to live there and learn how to exist in Japan), and then applying for whatever job you want. I'm interested in technology, so it makes it competitive and kinda pointless to hire an American over a Japanese person--who already lives there. I feel like a mangaka is a very Japanese-specific career, so, who know's, it might be easier for you. I really like this page! It's very pleasing to the eye! I have no idea what's happening though.

I guess you could look into foreign mangaka and see if you could get one of them to be your mentor -- I'm not sure how reasonable this is. Or email a publishing company to see the possibility? I feel they would know best. I'm not sure where you are, but Kodansha has a USA branch--they might be responsive. I don't know how easily it would be to communicate with Japanese publishers, but I feel like you'd get a response from English publishers."
