Anger,ff0ba3c,t3_er1ffl,1579467152.0,"<3 thats great you want to help him. often mad is sad disguised. sounds like he is in pain, i would say try to see his anger as pain and let him know you care and love him unconditionally that people can change and that he is so much more than his anger. violence and abuse is never okay, i know family is messy... there are lots of strategies out there for overwhelming feelings like walking away and counting to ten. sounds like he is feeling low and attacked and on guard, if possible make him feel emotionally safe and not criticized for fucking up and not knowing how to handle his emotions. trauma takes years to heal and it sounds like he and all of you have been through hell. much love.... not that im an expert, i have a lot of rage but im always working on it. i have lashed out at people and it was because i was hurting, felt like such shit and like i couldnt do anything right but thats because the way i was raised fucked with my head real bad. not a justification but an explanation."
