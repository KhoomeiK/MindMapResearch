WhitePeopleTwitter,fed8538,t1_fe63ll9,1579003236.0,What's your college education?  Puppy wrangling?  It definitely wasn't English.  Maybe try to get a refund 🤷‍♂️
WhitePeopleTwitter,fe8ind3,t1_fe6tmf1,1578926567.0,"Then by all means, please enlighten us with your ""TopMind"" intelligence. 

Tell me how the public should be forced to pay for an individual's education from which they derive no benefit?  If a market is saturated with degree holders in a field with limited jobs, does this mean get that degree?  No. It means the pay for that job will decline.  Simple supply & demand.  Find a job / career with actual market demand and you will be compensated in accordance with that demand.   The Market doesn't care about your transgender studies or liberal arts degree or aspirations to be an astronaut. The free market  pays for / compensates for it needs. Sorry, basketweaving isn't on that list"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fe879qu,t1_fe85e55,1578923367.0,"And what if I said I had no use / benefit from doctors?

Will you still agree to pay for my Lamborghini? 

The argument is not *against* higher education,  it's against forcing taxpayers to pay for it

Edit: I also don't believe there are many doctors ""struggling"" to pay off their student debt. But in the rare case that a medical school graduate chose an education that isn't marketable, how is that my financial responsibility??

Easy. It isnt.     No more than you're responsibility to pay for my Lamborghini"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fe6k27e,t1_fe6h1fx,1578893460.0,"Free higher education = not paying student debt

                 6 in 1 hand  =  1/2 dozen in the other


They are the same from a taxation(**theft**) standpoint. 
If the US cut the defense budget in half, I could probably afford the Lamborghini and ""I want free shit"" individual could probably pay their way to school. No loan or be easy to afford the loan with the reduced federal tax burden"
WhitePeopleTwitter,fe6j8bn,t1_fe6frc5,1578892656.0,"Im not interested in paying for wars **OR** your higher education.   You're basically saying that I should pay for you to go to college.  Nope. It's a bad idea on multiple levels. 

First, it's theft of my $ for something I derive no benefit. 

Second, it is neither a right nor requirement for finding a job and making a living. 

Third, when higher education *is* free (taxpayer funded), it becomes tremendously devalued as the degrees get ""dumbed down"" and literally anyone can take the classes.  Tell me;  what country has ""free college"" worked?  You're going to say Sweden or some other Nordic, homogenized country with a population less than New York?   Maybe notice their 40+% tax rates and $9/gal. fuel?  Or much higher rates of suicide? 

Fourth, not everyone is cutout for college. Regardless of how it is financed.  

You have yet to make a point about how it's moral or right that I should pay for your college. Because it isn't. 
It's no different that you (taxpayer) paying for my Lamborghini (dream) which was a poor decision.

I will agree that the US and state governments waste $.  Both have grown much too large and no longer serve the people...they serve themselves.

Don't even start complaining about lack of jobs or opportunities.  I have 2 brothers, none of us went to college. Older brother went to trade school, worked his way up to co-owner of a sprinkler company. Probably making 100k but only because he's putting so much back into his business.  Younger brother went to trade school for electrical.  Got into a local IBEW 10 yrs ago, he's good and knows his shit. Runs jobs as a foreman.  Making 120k with unbelievable medical benes.  Me, I was a local tractor trailer driver for 20 yrs. When I switched careers 4 yrs ago I was around 80k. I could have made 100k, but i wasn't a slave.  Hopefully in my last career: water / wastewater operations.  Still no college, but I might go for some business management courses before I get too close to switching to a desk job. 4 yrs in new career field.  The water / wastewater industries are *starving* for bodies. They paid for my classes and education to get licensed and pay is up to around 55k"

The public should not be forced to pay for student loans. Going to college is not a right. Its not at all required for many jobs. Loans were taken by free will and choice.

Edit: I agreed higher ed cost is out of control. Colleges are ripping kids off"
