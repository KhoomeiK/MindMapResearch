MMA,ffmn7gz,t1_ffk75lq,1580056831.0,"I don’t understand why it looks like he gave up unless that’s what people think every TKO looks like?

He took a knee to the head as the very first strike when he dodged Conor’s left. Then the shoulder strikes breaking his nose. He then separates. Tried to compose himself. Throws a headkick, then gets headkicked in jaw, then many punches to head after. 

I still believe he was concussed from the first knee. In the post fight he thought the shoulder strikes were elbows from Conor. 

He didn’t look like he gave up to me. It looked like he got outclassed."
MMA,ffivxvr,t1_ffivtrx,1579984000.0,Different video. You watched the one outside the ring with Rogan. The one I was referencing was at the desk with bisping and chael.

MMA,ffihltr,t1_fficqm5,1579974065.0,"In the post fight analysis with Bisping and Chael, Smith saying Cowboy should have just composed himself and that even he (Smith) knows that, even though he's not an MMA fighter.

He left out Cowboy first got surprised by a knee to the head, and was likely not thinking straight from that point on, then shoulder strikes. Then he tried to compose himself, throw a headkick, and conor answers with a headkick to the jaw. 

He insinuated Cowboy gave up or wasn't trying, not that Conor took advantage of everything and executed perfectly."
MMA,ffigki8,t1_ffhhe4a,1579973360.0,"You're taking it out of context, but you probably already know that. Here is more context:

> “**I've done things the correct way.** I’ve been tested by USADA since 2001 and I’ve never once had anything  come up,” he added. “It’s really not that hard to not test positive.  Whether it be tainted supplements or anything else. **You just don’t cheat. Don’t cheat and you don’t fail the test. It’s really not that hard**...**Don't cheat and you won't fail the test**”

Meanwhile we have a very recent example of Conor saying the same thing, then clearly having no interest in letting the fight prolong. 

So your ""I'm just saying..."" doesn't mean much when we have this example, which is the one that started the whole comment thread.

todayilearned,ff4n46i,t1_ff3ty18,1579567636.0,"I'd actually argue that point, as a big Gretzky fan. He wasn't that great of an athlete. Jordan was a way better athlete. Bo Jackson obviously as well. It's that Gretzky understood the game so well and knew how to take advantage of it."

If it was far easier in that era, why are the best plays of his era so far behind him as well? Sure you can say Lemieux would have been up there if it wasn't for cancer, we'll never know, but what about all the others.

If the Gretzky era was easier for points, then why do all of Gretzky era greats (outside Gretzky) have comparable points to today's era? They played with the same advantages.

If you will now say Gretzky's style wouldn't work today, that's silly. What made him good was understanding the game. If he was boring in the 90's I argue he'd be just as good as he would have adapted his game to today's game and been just as dominate."

Lastly, that was my point, you aren't paying for an unknown quantity. That's why they provide a guaranteed 3-4 hours of PPV regardless of how long the main fight is. If you don't want to watch the other fights, that's fine, but you can't complain you didn't get it."

There is so much at stake and they know anyone can get caught, so it's very hard for me to believe they'd risk it. It's much more likely that they claim it, when in actuality they just couldn't finish that opponent. 

The fact that they beat better opponents faster doesn't mean much to me as it's all about style matchups. Raging Al lasted way longer than Conor, but it's because he was will to take jabs freely to the face to be able to stuff the takedown, not because Khabib wanted to get rounds in (again imo)."

MMA,fehn1ms,t1_fehlfdr,1579119861.0,"Isn't Goddard the one that inconsistently makes them standup? Rogan goes a bit overboard in his criticism, but I'm pretty sure it was Goddard that was doing it annoyingly and inconsistently."
RealEstate,feh7yzr,t1_fegrwtr,1579111027.0,"Kwikset makes it easy to replace the keys though. Sorry, I know I'm not answering your question. Just that I was faced with same decision and decided to go with Kwikset as long-term it's lower cost maintenance, less hassle, etc. etc."

MMA,febm5cr,t1_febliq3,1578960261.0,I see it that way too. That just doesn't make Yoel always honorable and honest.
PublicFreakout,febjpi1,t1_feaf8vu,1578959542.0,"It's actually impressive how he telegraphs that in every way possible. His eyes, his pursed lips. his posture, grabbing with left hand. I wouldn't be surprising if he started grunting as he was winding up too. Amazing."
MMA,febhrsi,t1_feb07hl,1578958917.0,"So I admit her competition wasn't steep, but she looked pretty good to me for a white belt. She seemed to have a decent size advantage on her opponents, but her techniques were better than I expected (for a white)."
MMA,febdad9,t1_fe9on1o,1578957625.0,"I don't buy it. Yoel has a history of cheating when exhausted. See video below, vs jacarae grabbing cage. Being covered in water vs Weidman. Stoolgate. There is more, but this is the only recap vid I can find.

Kennedy definitely held his gloves and cheated, but that doesn't make stoolgate not cheating and make Yoel honest.

PublicFreakout,fe8c9o4,t1_fe79u90,1578924710.0,"This is the first law has been brought up in this thread. I’ve never argued what this is legally, I don’t even know where this took place."
PublicFreakout,fe5u3mo,t1_fe5skf1,1578874971.0,"Well that's an aggressive response, especially from someone who has clearly never performed an RNC (or been choked by one). I specifically said I don't condone the action. Regardless, I have been choked out a few times as I tried to escape and misjudged my timing, my windpipe has nowhere near come close to being crushed.

Stop basing reality off of movies, it's really not like that. There is nothing in this clip to suggest his windpipe was crushed."
movies,fe5s013,t1_fe55b9s,1578873680.0,"I thought he played that role perfectly. I guess it helped the guy he was playing was a self-absorbed weirdo, so it seemed authentic."
PublicFreakout,fe5lr9y,t1_fe5ks4q,1578871029.0,"I agree he could have had a preexisting condition and could be more seriously injured. We won't know. There is no argument that it's not safe to hold on longer than losing conciousness.

With that said, decerebrate posturing can also simply be caused by increased pressure in the brain, which happens with tight chokes and is not uncommon to see in BJJ and MMA. We won't know if that's what is in this case, but it doesn't indicate that he has a brain hemorrhage."
PublicFreakout,fe5jhnn,t1_fe5hmep,1578870204.0,"That is not indicated by his posturing, but there is no way for us to know if he did cause more damage without a follow-up. It's unlikely, but possible. Again, if it were likely we'd see this more frequently in MMA, especially in the lower divisions with worse officiating."
