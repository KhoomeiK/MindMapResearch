Existentialism,fffg3ph,t1_fffehpn,1579883205.0,"My point is it is nonsensical to assume that every single human thinks the ""most terrifying thing"" is death. I get what you're saying about the suicide bomber, that they create an ideology in order to transcend their fear of death, but I think the proof is in the pudding, they kill themselves because a) they are not afraid of death, or b) because they have been indoctrinated to believe in some fate worse than death, which in both cases, death is not the absolute most terrifying thing to every human. Regardless of how you feel about if what they think is true or right."

How did your gamble play out, would you rather have never existed?"
Existentialism,fff8tnn,t3_etb0vy,1579878572.0,"How can something that does not yet exist give consent? Is death really universally "" The most terrifying thing to a human"" ?? What about religious people, or suicide bombers, are they terrified of death? 

I mean I get the point you're trying to make but if i heard someone say this in real life I would be so full of cringe I think my body would auto-run away from the conversation."
todayilearned,ff77itw,t3_ery2yg,1579642655.0,"I know its a polarizing issue, but this is why I do not support the death penalty. There will always be some margin of error in prosecution, and eventually innocent people will be killed for crimes they didn't commit."

getdisciplined,feejt6y,t1_feei5mj,1579035191.0,"what do you mean ""how much work""?...like measured in time?

Obviously what is considered hard work varies from person-to-person. Although I think defining hard work is besides the point here, the point being made is that attributing 100% your successes (or failures) to the work you've put in overlooks many factors that are out of your control."

getdisciplined,fee7h4e,t3_eoocr8,1579027979.0,"Totally agree with #5, success is a combination of hard work and luck. Luck, even down to what country or time of birth, is so often overlooked when measuring success. It's easy for people to assume someone who is doing well deserves so, and someone who is unsuccessful must have done something wrong. That being said, working hard and being  unrelentingly passionate and hardworking will obviously skew the odds of life in your favor."
