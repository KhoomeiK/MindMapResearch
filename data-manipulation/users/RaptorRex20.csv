HuntShowdown,ffumvqj,t1_ffum1xc,1580245316.0,"One of the main strengths of the hounds though is the fact they hunt in packs and outrun hunters, hives can be outrun and also one-hit with most weapons, Imolators only usually come in singles so they can be dealt with easily especially with knuckles or a hammer, and meatheads are able to be outrun.

Being in numbers means hunters usually have to reload or use melee to finish the pack so you can't just blast them with one or two shots and be done like most infected, and being faster than hunters means you can't just ignore them and keep running. 

I think they belong just as much as any of the other special infected types.
