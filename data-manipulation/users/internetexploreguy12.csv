depression,fe8sros,t1_fe8soq5,1578930286.0,No worries. Everyone here has their fair share of problems.
depression,fe8sbak,t1_fe8qlh4,1578930122.0,I think thats a bit harsh. They are trying to help and they are my parents after all.
depression,fe86aqp,t3_eo464x,1578923026.0,Also while she was complaining about me not doing anything she brings up kids of friends who have basically skipped school as well. She thinks I wont apply deferment because those other kids didn't. I don't know why those kids skipped school but she said they all went to a mental hospital in the end. Maybe they had some similar issues? I dont know. But my mom trying to pinpoint why Im skipping school makes me feel panicked and stressed everytime she asks.
depression,fe6s0bj,t3_enua94,1578902648.0,Yeah really want to stop existing. Only thing stopping me is the possibility of pain and dissapointment before i go. Thats why i always wish of some unrelated accident happening or just vanishing.
depression,fe271ec,t3_enj587,1578835133.0,Yeah I have a dolphin.
depression,fdgs8kt,t3_el7p7n,1578406993.0,Same. When I got into this slump my parents keep saying im lazy and keep advising me to be more proactive and do stuff. But they emphasise the lazy part a lot. And it makes me feel like shit because I already know it.
depression,fdcyy1g,t3_e6rx0l,1578288501.0,"Ignore comment. Just using this as a log.

Missed exams. Holidays over. Still cant go to school. Deferment still not applied. Paranoid and stressed about teacher poking about and trying to 'help' by telling my parents everything about my life at school. Its like privacy and personal space dont mean anything anymore. Im really starting to dislike my teacher even though hes trying to help. He lied about not contacting my parents. He thinks i might be a druggie but hes just taking stabs at what my problem might be. My parents pretending they have not contacted him. It feels so claustrophobic. Stressed, paranoid about a lot of things right now, especially my teacher. Whatever hes doing, its not helping. Still afraid of killing myself. Still keep thinking about it. Hospital visit too far away so no valid reason for deferment of school."
depression,fdcy14s,t1_fdcxstg,1578287683.0,Its not that I dont listen to music its just that I do so rarely. Most of my time is spent browsing reddit or watch streamers to distract myself. Either that or sleep. Music usually comes as a last resort when I dont have the energy to watch or browse anything.
depression,fdcxuuk,t3_eknnr3,1578287529.0,"People trying to help go ""open up"" ""talk about it"" ""go out more"" ""stop being so lazy"". Or it feels like thats what would happen if they knew I might have depression. It feels like theyll never understand."
depression,fdcxqe5,t3_ekl4wl,1578287419.0,Yeah sometimes I just hope an accident would happen or if I just vanished. That way I wouldnt have to blame myself for my own death.
depression,fdcxm2e,t3_ekfp0m,1578287316.0,Yeah its either that or me endlessly browsing reddit as a distraction for myself. If im not doing anything else my mind wanders off to worse things.
depression,fdcxhty,t3_ekmksg,1578287213.0,I feel stressed and paranoid when family and close ones are around yeah. Dont listen to music but I do feel way happier and more relaxed alone.
depression,fdcxfby,t3_ekfszp,1578287152.0,Turns out it was my teacher who contacted my dad who told my mom and feeds them info. From the looks of it my teacher seems to only be taking jabs and what my problem is. Even sent my dad an article about stories about drug addict revcovery(Im not a drug addict). I am starting to despise my teacher a whole lot more. Why does he have to do this? I get hes trying to help but its making me feel even more stressed and worried. Its not helping at all. I dont understamd why they cant leave me alone.
depression,fdag3ck,t3_ekbvjq,1578245635.0,"My family keeps asking me to open up to them because I seem to have a problem. On the other hand because I'm not really doing anything they go ""you better go and do something otherwise you will become lazier"" ""You sit at home all day on the bed not boring meh"" ""you need to exercise more"" ""stop being so lazy"" (In singaporean slang so its a bit weird). They also seem to talk with other people regarding my issue behind my back and somehow found out about my suicidal tendencies so much so they fowarded a suicide hotline on whatsapp. But when we meet in person its like nothing happened. They just pretended that message never existed. Tried to find out who they were talking to to no avail. Became really panicked an distressed about it because it feels like my privacy has been breached and makes me want to close myself off even more. All these things added up make me thoroughly convinced opening up to my family is a horrible idea, just based on their attitude about me not doing anything. It just feels like theyll treat it superficially and be done with it and say ""Just go out more then you wont be like that"". The only people I felt comfortable talking to was the person who was diagnosing me and my counsellor. But now I suspect my counsellor might be the one contacting my mom. But the counsellor denied it and I trusted her because its her job to keep mum about it. But I am starting to keep my guard up around her.

So yeah. Opening up to close ones is a terrible idea from my perspective because it feels like theyll never truly understand. I only felt comfortable talking to professionals about this. Sorry about my rambling. Im done."
singapore,fdad7m5,t3_ek3ajv,1578244739.0,Need to apply deferment for poly but no actual valid reason yet. Only a hospital referral note for subsidised fees. No idea what to do. Do I wait until the hospital visit like 3 months later even though school is opening now?
depression,f9qa1y0,t1_f9q9gbk,1575557728.0,Seeing a counsellor soon and going for an mental health appointment as well. Problem is the sessions are quite far away.
