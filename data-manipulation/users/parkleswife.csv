I let the dough rise for an hour in the bowl it was made in and I baked in a 12"" cast iron skillet.   I preheated the skillet in the oven and put the pizza together on parchment paper.    Slid that it into the hot pan when it was ready (with the parchment paper, which I pulled out easily after 5 minutes).

It was pillowy and my husband enjoyed it.    I like working with dough but rarely eat it."

vancouver,ff5bd1c,t1_ff57uko,1579586081.0,"Back in the day we'd picked up fresh killed/cooked crabs and some beer and went to the beach for a two person perfecpicnic in Tofino.

A gorgeous white dog came along, found itself a good stick and laid down in the sand beside us.   I was pretty sure this dog was eyeballing my crab and that was fine with me.   I dug out the most awesome piece of crab and leaned slowly over to offer it.
S/he took it, splapped it around for a minute and SPAT IT ONTO THE SAND.

[crabwaster, ffs.](https://imgur.com/a/qmL4tht)   I was also lowfretting that this dog had no attached people and I don't want to drive away and I don't want to take the dog...
as we packed up and got organized to go, the dog jumped up and ran to a construction site I hadn't even noticed before, he or she belonged to a worker there.    Tofino dogs, man.
