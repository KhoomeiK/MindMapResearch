DankLeft,ffftd4i,t1_fffrd4a,1579891372.0,"i've been noticing popular ""progressive"" politicians employing more and more leftist talking points, and i love it. wealth inequality continues to balloon so these points are increasingly resonant with people as time goes on. we're fast approaching a genuine leftist moment, which is great, but it also means that the bourgie fucks who run our society are also aware of this.

we have a protracted fight in front of us, so remember that theory is just one facet of leftist politics; it must also be applied through praxis. organize! for the first time in probably my entire lifetime, we have popular politicians willing to aid in organization."
