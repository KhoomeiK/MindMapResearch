People admire someone so much they don't want to know the truth and would rather pretend it's all fake. Yes there are fake case against celebs like Johnny Depp was accused of domestic abuse by his ex but that turned out to be a lie. Now I hear he was suing her for her accusations. 

Plus when you are rich, you are more vulnerable to lawsuits and accusations because people want your money. You don't need to win the lottery for it, if you are a celebrity, you then have lot of money because your are worth more. But the privilege that comes with it is when you do get accused, people will be on your side and automatically assume this is all false but when you are a regular person, people automatically believe the victim and your life is ruined. Even if charges are dropped and they were proven you are innocent, people do not care. Love is blind.

I am not sad about his death because I never even heard of him and I didn't even know he existed until his death. You can tell I do not watch basketball. I don't get all grief over peoples death or else I would be miserable and never be happy because people die all the time. But many of us do get sad when it's our child or someone who was close to us. If it was someone we admired, we also get sad but not as much if it were our own child or partner.

And I will say using Kobe as an example was a poor one. But I know what you were trying to ask and stuck to the general answer.

It's possible to work a non educated job and still be paid more than minimum wage.

Then you can get better jobs from there. If you feel comfortable driving big rigs, you can get a job as a school bus driver or as a trucker if you like to travel or work as a public bus driver.

You obviously haven't heard about trans women getting assaulted or murdered because the guy didn't know they were trans. This is what I was referring to.

Trans need to disclose because men would be expecting to see a vagina and assume the woman is born female. They wouldn't want there to be any surprises for the man.

It really is a privilege when you are not required a doctor's note when you are sick or when you can take time off work to see your kids perform or be allowed to leave work at 5 and not be scolded or penalized if you are late due to traffic or weather.

ABDL,fffgvp9,t3_et2xnr,1579883688.0,"So what do you suggest we call it? Let's come up with another term for telling someone we are ABDL. 

&#x200B;

But being ABDL does have affect on kids, all it takes is for your ex to say you are an ABDL and the judge can use it against you in court and give them full custody. People have lost their jobs for being ABDL. That is why it's risky to show your face in your ABDL photos you put online. If you have kids, someone can be calling social services and then you are dealing with harassment. Now if social workers and the judge understood this is a kink and has nothing to do with minors and has no impact on your functioning as an adult or parent, then it wouldn't affect you. All it takes is ignorance. 

Also people have been kicked out of their parents homes or been threatened to just for being ABDL. They have also been put into therapy for their diaper fetish because their parents didn't understand it and thought this was something they could get over. 

&#x200B;

Fetish isn't a choice, we don't pick this. 

&#x200B;

And no, being ABDL isn't LGBT. Lot of people don't need to know about our choice of underwear and our bathroom habits or what we do at home. Our kids don't need to know how much we enjoy our underwear and how we go to the bathroom. Our boss doesn't need to know either. If you still live with your parents, you need to ""come out"" if they find your diapers so they know you don't have a medical issue. Parents worry about their kids. If random people find out about your diapers, you can pass it off as a medical issue. People don't care about you wearing them and won't say anything so you don't even need to ""come out."" 

I say being ABDL is a lot easier when you are an adult because when you are a child who likes diapers, you deal with parents who don't understand it, you will deal with bullying and the teasing if kids find out so that would be another reason why your parents wouldn't want you wearing them. Kids do care, adults do not. You deal with the strong urges and the OCD thoughts about it you may even resort to stealing them when you get the chance which doesn't seem uncommon in ABDLs. Many of us seem to have stolen diapers as kids. Took them from homes or daycares or nursing homes or special ed or stores. While there are resources for other kinks and porn when you catch your 12 year old going on porn sites, you can discuss it all with them and explain sex and common kinks but what happens if they were looking at ABDL porn, you as a vanilla parent have no resources and no support so you don't understand it either and you reject it and as the 12 year old, you have had these desires for a while and you didn't pick this but your mom is telling you how sick this all is and how it's all twisted and disgusting. You as the child think you are a terrible person and disgusting. I have been through this as a child. You have no one to talk to about it for support and you bottle it all in and you are confused about all this but you don't ever talk about it, not even your therapist or school counselor because you have been taught this is all sick. You don't want your therapist to think this of you too. You also can't go online either for it because they have all became 18 and up only. So I got lucky I was born early enough to be in ABDL communities as a minor to feel less sick and to even talk to adults as a minor. Times have changed. 

Also don't forget as a child you will have parents who will take your things away because you are too old for it or the toy is too inappropriate or you are too big to be carrying that thing around. You will have parents who will tell you what toys you should buy with your own money you have gotten for your birthday or from chores. Being ABDL is not easy for a child either but when you are an adult, it's better. For even as a parent I can understand why parents would do these things, you want them to grow and develop, not regress, you want them to be independent, you don't want them to lose bladder control or have a weak bladder because they never got to develop their muscles properly in their bladder because you let them wore diapers often as a kid. But when they are teens, that is totally different. By then they are developed enough to make their own choices and are already independent."

&#x200B;

While I feel for them, if they were not doing drugs, leaving their needles and garbage, then maybe people will feel sorry for them and be more willing to help them than chasing them off their campsite or harassing them? 

&#x200B;

The ones who don't do these things are the ones who are living in their cars or RVs, still are working, or staying with friends or family, and they are doing what they can to get back on their feet again. I am sure these people don't get chased out. They are what we call the hidden homeless because we tend to not notice them and only their car full of stuff is the indication they are homeless. They also do not do drugs or throw their trash all over. They will find a public trash can and throw their trash in there and I am not talking about having a 13 gal trash bag. My family was basically homeless for 3 months when my parents sold their house when I was 3 so we were between homes. They rented a storage unit and stayed with a friend of my Dad's until our house was finished being built. 

&#x200B;

And what is wrong with homeless shelters, better than being in the streets. I think that is something our city is doing to help these people. Not everyone is privileged to have a place to stay nor do they have a car nor have a family to stay with and they can't afford a storage unit so they lose everything. My heart goes out to them. My younger brother was homeless after the break up with his ex and he stayed at our house in my parents RV because he didn't want to be in the way. He stayed with us and stored his stuff in our garage until he got another house. He was privileged. He also didn't pay any rent because he was family and it was temporary. But some people lose everything when they go between homes and they have no place to go so that is what homeless shelters are for. 

&#x200B;

Some people might not consider it being homeless just as long as you have a place to stay rather it's your sibling or parents or relative or a friend or even living in a hotel or in your RV in a RV site you are renting.

Now for crosswalks and intersections, that is different. You obviously have to stop when there is a stop sign or a red light. If you see a car stopped at a crosswalk, it's common sense to also stop too and check for a pedestrian. People have also been hit this way too or had close calls because of cars not stopping and they blew past a stopped car. As a pedestrian, it's also best to assume everyone on the road is an idiot so do not assume they will stop while you are crossing at a crosswalk.
