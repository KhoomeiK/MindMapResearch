SmallYTChannel,ff7c1u2,t3_ervn9g,1579646027.0,"As long as youre just asking them to check your channel out and sub \*if they like your content\*, then I would say its alright.

Personally I always stress to others that they should only sub if they like my content, and that I will only sub back if I like theirs as well. If they dont like how I do that, they would probably they were probably expecting sub for sub, and probably wouldnt have watched my videos anyways, so its not like I lost a potential subscriber.

My advice: Work on developing a deep community, not a wide one."
SmallYTChannel,ff7bn8w,t3_es0j1x,1579645689.0,"I mean...to be honest youre gonna need to teach yourself computer skills and photoshop etc. to be able to make high quality content like Im sure youre envisioning. My best advice is to just mess around with programs like that to develop your skills, use skillshare or something like that to learn (no I am not sponsored lol). Theres also alot of tutorial videos on YT for you to check out and learn from.

If you want to go the free route to develop your skills, I would recommend paint.net and shotcut. However they are a bit tricky to work with and require more skills to put out high quality stuff with than something like Photoshop or Premiere.

As much as you might not want to hear this, most of the time the programs that require the least computer skills and have the easiest learning curve, I have found are the ones you need to pay for. Adobe products are a must IMO, and if youre a student you can get the entire Adobe suite for just 20 bucks a month.

I like to run my videos a bit longer sometimes, though, up to 20 minutes. But I keep the cuts in to skip parts where Im not making a joke or theres not much going on. 

It kinda sucks though, because I remember watching markiplier lets plays way back and going through the game experiencing it more or less in the same way he was, frustration, boredom, excitement and all.

Over that month, I have improved my editing a lot, as well as my commentary.

I have a much different recording setup than I did at the start due to issues with the old ones. I wanted flexibility with my facecam and gameplay, so I now record them on separate insctances of OBS. I record my mic on audacity though, in case I accidently forget to redirect the output for my facecam footage, which would result in my facecam getting overwritten by the game as it records. I wouldnt have a facecam, but at least I could salvage the video."
SmallYTChannel,ff5b0a7,t3_erixw2,1579585731.0,"Definitely possible, but IMO you need to be high quality to separate yourself from the crowd, even as a small channel. If people see you are putting a ton of effort into your videos, they will be more inclined to believe you are in it for the long haul, and will be more inclined to subscribe. Being proficient at editing is a must, and keeping attention of your audience is important.

At least thats my theory. But what do I know, only 16 subs after a month...seems a bit slow still.
