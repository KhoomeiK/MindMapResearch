confessions,fdn38jg,t3_em9a4w,1578575974.0,"Why dont you try to talk to her about it calmly. And tell her you want to work on it with her. Relationships are sometimes about leading your troubled partner to a better behavioural pattern. I don't think the answer to every problem in a relationship is break up. If it's not something insurmountable like abuse, cheating or something offer a helping hand. Have some perspective. May be she is also putting up with you in ref to something. May be you can both work on it. Behaviour management can be learnt over time. If it seems worth it, invest in making her better."
