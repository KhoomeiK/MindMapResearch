TwoXChromosomes,fgjfvvv,t3_eyuqcd,1580843182.0,"I take a BC called Tri-Sprintec. It doesn’t stop my periods but has caused me to have regular cycles instead of the madhouse I had before. I also have endometriosis and have experienced lessened pain since starting birth control, as it seems to make my periods lighter and shorter. It’s not a guarantee but it has helped personally. It’s not a treatment for it, though."
