TBI,ffp9t84,t3_eu7j3z,1580089736.0,"I got my tbi when I was 9 (I'm 24 now) and I didn't think I would find something I could do. I've tried working ""regular"" jobs since I was 16 and it never worked out. I would end up burning myself out working like 20 hours a week which isn't enough to make a living. By pure chance I ended up finding out that I'm really good at working with dogs. Fast forward to now I'm a full time pet sitter and am starting to build a grooming business and eventually a daycare/boarding faculty. That's not to say you should drop everything and do the same but maybe have faith you may eventually be able to find something that clicks for you? I'm sorry you're in a tough spot rn. I hope things get better for you"
