OSU,ff2zkpn,t1_ff2z15m,1579529608.0,I'm a transfer student so I never lived on campus. To me off campus sounds like a way better deal though. On campus is like $10k a year plus $1k for a meal plan? Then they kick you out over break? That's like $1k in rent a month. I would just live off campus and get a Kroger or giant eagle card (they're free) and buy food there and get gas points if you have a car.

aww,fd5yz4s,t1_fd5xbs7,1578183278.0,"I really dumbed it down. There's a lot more to it like raising them from birth. But there's a couple in Russia who have a pet bear (I don't think this is him) for years. Like it's a full grown bear and it eats at the table with them. Kevin Richardson and Dean Schneider have been taking care of lions for 20+ years. I mean they take naps together, play together, ect. All of these are on IG, YouTube, Facebook. There's another couple in Russia that have a pet mountain lion (IG: i_am_puma) that's pretty much full grown. I'm not advocating just anyone can do this. You definitely have to know what you're doing, but it turns out animals just don't like being abused (the circus) and when they want to be left alone leave them alone. Like I said I'm not advocating that anyone can go out and do this."
aww,fd5uhw0,t1_fd5pjt8,1578181657.0,It's probably just well taken care of and treated with respect.
aww,fd5ud1d,t1_fd5drpv,1578181611.0,It's probably Russia and Russian bears are not normal bears.
