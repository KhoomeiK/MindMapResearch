The point was sadly driven home when I went to see the first IT movie in not my usual theater (my usual doesn't allow children under I think 15 in for ratings above pg-13). So, at this regular theater 2 seats to my left was a little girl (7ish) with her parents (I assume). She was relaxed at first, soon was clutching her legs, then was crying.  I could only see her wet lil cheeks and her little body jerking with sobs (film was loud but I never heard her).  I caught her eyes once trying to share a sympathetic look but she just looked embarrassed then turned away.
I was so pissed! Still am.  I never caught her parents consoling her so I suspect they didn't even notice.  These people and those like them are the reason we all can't have a nice society with respect, dignity, equality, and peace.

I said something to them, didn't out the girl though,but they tried to bite my head off, were cruel, lewd, and crass about it too... Which was precisely what I expected.

Like persons with APD, narcissists generally lack empathy and tend to have unrealistically high opinions of themselves, and, like psychopaths, narcissists tend to form shallow relationships, to exploit and manipulate others, and to be glib and superficially charming. Unlike many persons with APD, however, narcissists are generally not impulsive, aggressive, or habitually deceitful.""

And whats the ""right"" thing to do?
I seek that answer multiple times a day as I'm sure you do too.

Forgiveness, bah, I'm not even aiming for that.  Like you I just want a little peace, some calm in my head/heart.
I love her but I fear her, I'm dating someone just like her and I want to get away from them both. It's sticky. And a drag often... But we're endeavoring, moving forward, and that's hugely important.

I recommend books that neither of them (mom or so) read... I'm pissed they won't. You're not alone.

I need to, want to go to counselling... Good on you for doing it."
sanantonio,fctgjoh,t1_fct5a0a,1577942558.0,"Thanks for the clarification and the suggestions.  I do appreciate the positive effort.

But 2-4 hours of illegal fireworks is the norm in the parts SanAntonio we've lived or visited in.  I don't expect unreasonable accommodation, but just like yielding to pedestrians on crosswalks, the accomodation is also abiding within the law.
But it is what it is, thankfully I was able to gift bose to my vets this year, we do what we can."
GetMotivated,fct1jrr,t1_fcrzo2s,1577930476.0,"What you've written resonates with me (co-dependant, recovering doormat, defensive lier, anger type:supressive, recovering cutter), and a book that actively helps me build this muscle of compassion (for self and my family source) is ""Adult Children: Secrets of Dysfunctional Families"" by Friel.

I like the thought that what I unpack and resolve in myself is righting negativity done by the generations that came before me in their silent suffering...
It's also helping me deal with the likelihood that I may not get closure, the apologies I crave from those who've wounded me.  My dad passed recently, that's one book ended, but in analyxing his life, unearthing/deducing his suffering, I can understand, sympathize, and heal for us both; taking him from a villain to a victim.

Rock on!"
sanantonio,fcspki0,t1_fcphcs4,1577921878.0,"Oh right, since you're untroubled it means no one else is. Silly me, that's only logical."
ScarySigns,fcsp8q6,t3_eigu7t,1577921646.0,"I like this. To the point, direct, none of the usual sugar-coating nonsense."
sanantonio,fcpdqm3,t1_fcowulv,1577859649.0,"If only I could keep anyone from doing anything... But no, all y'alls actions are on your own heads.
So long as nobody trespasses on my property I'm stuck surving whatever gets dished out.

Sure would be nice to get some sleep though..."
sanantonio,fcpd7du,t1_fckslm8,1577859037.0,"I rather hope people shooting fireworks get stitches.
For all my military people who are doing what they can to wait-this display of mass disregard/ignorance/selfishness out, all the pet owners who'll be trying to calm pets and likely cleaning their fearful messes, for all those who have to work sans sleep tomorrow... Fireworks shooters in San Antonio are ungrateful and criminal, I hope their children do better than they are."
sanantonio,fcpcvtk,t1_fcl98sm,1577858676.0,"Yup. When actions speak louder than words, when people's disregard for others, their community, and decency is so loud it can't be ignored."
sanantonio,fcovlx4,t1_fcotmm0,1577842788.0,"There you go again being hy-larious!

Sadly I'll be keeping my household distracted/reassured as we all, again, have to tolerate other peoples abuse of their liberties through noise-pollution till they're done being a drag.
Oh well, it's only once a year.

Except it's not.
Oh well, not everyone lives mindfully, but at least we're all free."
sanantonio,fcot94b,t1_fcndksu,1577840927.0,"This made me laugh so hard, it would take effort for you to be more wrong.
But it makes me sad that you're probably way too old for your mindset to be blamed on youth...
One more reason we, as a society, don't have nice things (like order, safety, peace, progress)."
WholeFoodsPlantBased,fcn2oob,t3_ehz7c0,1577801583.0,"I'm in favor of managing one's diet to get the nutriends one needs. But I also think too often people fret unnecessarily about the isdue of vitamins/minerals; I eat well (a variety of foods) and keep a wellness journal.  Bm changes get recorded, unusually heavy/light periods recorded, fatigue, increased energy, uncommonly good sleep/difficulty sleeping, and through this I expect my body will tell me if what I'm doing/eating needs to be adjusted.  I don't trust generalized nutrition requirements."
sanantonio,fcln693,t1_fcl248w,1577751726.0,Excellent points!
sanantonio,fcln29c,t1_fclmcd8,1577751651.0,"This is true. :[

This is also why we can't have nice things."
childfree,fclmlly,t3_ehidxt,1577751334.0,Hah! That's called biology giving you a dose of drugs in an effort for the child to survive... Thats what it takes.
sanantonio,fckwzpq,t1_fckv9f5,1577734995.0,"Personally I just dislike it when people deliberately break the law, disrupt the sleep of those who need sleep, and disregard / are oblivious to fire hazard potential.  There are plaves and times for these things, adults should habe the decency, respect, and good sense to demonstrate an ounce of self restraint for the good of the society/community structure that makes their lifestyle/existance possible."
sanantonio,fckwdoe,t1_fckv95t,1577734625.0,"Yes, people firing illegal fireworks are stupid.  Good point.

Edit: ""Stupid"" may not apply to all but selfish, ignorant, criminal, will apply in some combination to all illegal fireworks shooters.
Downviting me doesn't make my statement less acvurate, but it does show you're aware of the truth in my statement."
SweatyPalms,fck4t6v,t1_fcisqmt,1577716606.0,ROFLMAO!  I only laugh to keep from weeping at the truth of this. xD
GetMotivated,fcj3zqt,t1_fcj2l1u,1577676702.0,The ones that lead to damaging/toxic places.
hitmanimals,fcg1vm2,t3_eh34hx,1577635749.0,"I dont think that's murderous intent, just harsh judgement with incredulity. LOL"
Mindfulness,fcc0429,t1_fc8ho7t,1577592902.0,"I do feel that rings more true, and more self-defined. 
 I appreciate your commenting, made my day. :]"
SweatyPalms,fc6op05,t3_egedmw,1577485634.0,"This is proof that effective communication builds trust which in turn yields effective results.

Now if only people who drive could figure this out... Most people: ""I passed my drivers test, I don't need to study/ensure my knowledge is thorough, refine my skills, or review, ever!"".

Imagine if people did the same for other life skills...
Mobility: ""I can crawl, it gets me from point A to B. I'm all set!""

Speech: ""I can request food, buy stuff, tell people I like/dislike em, what more do I need?  I'm a natural at this!""

Self refinement: ""I have emotions so I react, its not the end of the world, if people dont like it then they're wrong.  It'll be fine.""

Oh wait... People do this in other areas of life besides driving.
This is why we can't have nice things."
