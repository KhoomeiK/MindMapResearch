It's a job that demands the highest level of professionalism and respect, because you're being held in the utmost trust.

My wife is also 6 months pregnant, and I've been to a few of her appointments, including one where she was examined by a male resident.

gaming,fe9so01,t1_fe9ld5q,1578941128.0,"There are dozens of us! But really, yes this thread is me. We both work (myself from home, and her hours are longer) and I do nearly all the outside-of-home chores like groceries, and do the cooking. After dinner I can't spend 5 minutes doing something for myself without getting a text from the other room asking for attention. And when I am on the couch, the TV is playing something she picked to watch, but she's often not paying attention anyway. So I just sit and stare at something I don't care about thinking about the more fun things I could be doing.

The same qualifier everyone else said applies here too - I love her more than anything - but I'd still like to be able to do something alone that isn't work or chores.

On the plus side, I got Mario Kart 8 on Switch yesterday, and she seems to like it. We played together for an hour or so, and then I went out for a bit and when I came back she was still playing. Now if she wants to do something together it won't have to bore me to death."
