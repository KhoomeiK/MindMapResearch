WhatsWrongWithYourDog,ffjh8o0,t1_ffjcg1n,1579998183.0,I believe it's a Muppet.
Pomeranians,ffgmw2b,t3_eth7v3,1579909940.0,Does he vibrate like a cell phone in the car?
exmormon,fff714j,t1_ffevzl6,1579877334.0,"Thank you for explaining that the organization doesn't believe in a diety. I appreciated seeing the seven tenets and thought they all sounded like good principles to follow, but since I don't believe in a god necessarily I also don't believe in a devil. Now I want to look into this organization a little more."
todayilearned,ffcqieh,t1_ffbd2ki,1579805122.0,You can also replace Baptist with Mormon.
TLCsisterwives,ffc47k9,t1_ffbl21j,1579791125.0,"Mormon garments have cap sleeves and t-shirts can be worn easily without the garment sleeves poking out. That being said, Kodi and his wives aren't Mormon and they don't seem to have to wear any special undies."
Pomeranians,ffc3v5r,t3_esrmwh,1579790887.0,It's an enhancement to the product that we didn't have to pay extra for.
dogswithjobs,ffa3vav,t3_eseago,1579727360.0,I'll bet the patrons don't even have to pay extra for a little dog hair in their drinks!
Pomeranians,ffa1kar,t3_es6uoj,1579726032.0,Kiwi is so petite and I love the crazy ear hair.
loveafterlockup,ff4vyg8,t1_ff4sy0c,1579573748.0,"Thank you for nicely educating us. I stand corrected. It still makes someone sound uneducated or illiterate if they're saying ""supposably"" when they mean supposedly."
loveafterlockup,ff4pwd4,t1_ff4ejad,1579569589.0,"The correct word is supposedly. Supposably is not a word and when someone says it they do not sound particularly educated or literate. For the record, flustrated and fustrated aren't real words either."
loveafterlockup,ff3uef5,t1_ff3lcsy,1579549067.0,"I don't want to say I dumped a guy just because he said ""supposably"", but it was a contributing factor."
TLCsisterwives,ff03yav,t1_fezqq3g,1579464914.0,And why would she want to clean such a big house and pay the increased utility costs associated with a bigger house? It just doesn't make sense.
loveafterlockup,few9cc7,t1_fevj10a,1579407087.0,That's the only way I'd be able to be friends with a clown.
traderjoes,fep9p3y,t3_eq5xdx,1579315281.0,We have Steven Seagull at the Salt Lake City Trader Joe's. The seagull is our state bird.
Music,fep92ye,t1_fep8g6t,1579314883.0,"I grew up in the 70's listening to Jim Croce and Harry Chapin. I'd say they were both great singers and song writers and if you like one of them you'll probably like the other too.
Edited to add Gordon Lightfoot and Cat Stevens who are also great singers and song writers from the same era."
aww,felmrza,t1_felm89p,1579225909.0,"In my head I'm pronouncing it ""pissed off"" which probably sounds more familiar to many of us than ""off-piste"". I really was glad someone asked what it meant."
aww,fellkl7,t1_felkoz8,1579225080.0,"Thanks for asking this! I feel like they could just say ""piste-off"" though."
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,feinu76,t1_feik801,1579142888.0,I liken Uggs to hugs for my feet.
My600lbLife,fdqhrhw,t1_fdpqazg,1578666986.0,"Yeah, I think it might be nice for a day. I truly would not want to be bedridden and have to rely on someone else to take care of me. I still like the idea of the SO bringing me tasty food though."
My600lbLife,fdo86yz,t1_fdo42u4,1578600574.0,"I think there may have been a few who were mobile enough to get their own foods, but most seem to have enablers. I just can't understand why the enabler would contribute to a loved one's poor health. What would happen if the enabler just started bringing their loved one healthy food? Yeah, they might get upset, but what's a bed-ridden 600 pound person going to do? If they start yelling it's easy enough to leave."
My600lbLife,fdo1u7j,t3_emcqev,1578597342.0,"I wish my SO would just bring me food all day, every day and I wouldn't have to leave my bed. He was not on board with this."
loveafterlockup,fdnztei,t1_fdmj1w7,1578596193.0,"I doubt she had her tubes ""untied"", so she may just have a booze baby."
exmormon,fdluypb,t1_fdlpcsw,1578533106.0,I wonder if anyone did Harry Chapin's temple work.
gifs,fdlkx6l,t1_fdkyljf,1578526342.0,"Which part of Canada is not a ""Canadian snow mine""?"
aww,fdfe6ln,t1_fdf9cx8,1578359598.0,I would read a book about your husky.
90DayFiance,fcxr0sy,t1_fcwkgkv,1578069305.0,"So, Robert and Anny got the K1 Visa because the consulate just lets anyone have one due to being ""overwhelmed""? I'm not surprised Angela and Michael didn't get their K1, but their story seems slightly more legit than Robert and Anny's."
trashpandas,fcxqmx1,t3_ejfd3g,1578069125.0,"If there's a trash panda in this picture, do we get a prize for finding her?"
90DayFiance,fcxpppz,t1_fcvc0sw,1578068553.0,"I still have a little glimmer of hope that at least some of Tania and Syngin's story is scripted by TLC. If she was as bad as she comes across on the show, why would Syngin stick around?"
AnimalsBeingBros,fcxnn3j,t3_eje6d8,1578067233.0,"She's probably wondering why her kittens are so prickly, but she's really grateful she didn't give birth to them."
exmormon,fckbxhb,t1_fck4qd0,1577721861.0,I wanted to ask if garments happen to be flame retardant. It sounds like the type of material is really what matters. Thanks for your comment.
SaltLakeCity,fcj1bnj,t1_fcj0sx2,1577674813.0,Aw...you're my people if you remember them. I used to listen to their shows when they were on 107.5 The End in the late 90's and early 00's.
trashpandas,fc9sncw,t3_egjwzq,1577557617.0,"They appear to be trying to strike up some sort of deal. On a related note, does the human seem to have an excessive number of items on their utility belt?"
AskReddit,fc1rksv,t1_fc1rcr0,1577327488.0,"Maybe ""lad"" just sounds more respectable to me than the dude, guy, stoner, homie I buy my weed from."
