Deserts and xeric shrublands are a habitat type defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature. Deserts and xeric shrublands form the largest terrestrial biome, covering 19% of Earth's land surface area.
Ecoregions in this habitat type vary greatly in the amount of annual rainfall they receive, usually less than 250 millimetres (10 in) annually. Generally evaporation exceeds rainfall in these ecoregions. Temperature variability is also diverse in these lands."

KC, SF, Seattle, and LA are not the same size cities. On a map at this scale, they are all shown as just dots. SF is 200 sq miles. LA is 500 sq mi. Those dots make each fire out to be thousands of square miles. The total area on fire is 23,000 square miles. If LA's black dot is to scale for 500, then I need 46 black dots to cover the area on fire. Those flames are well bigger than 23,000 sq miles. There are also well more than 46 of them. 

I saw a graphic that took sq miles on fire and made it a circle. I could put that over an area I'm familiar with and get an idea of how much total fire there is. It's flat crazy and horrible and unimaginable. Basically my entire state is on fire. 

The map here gives me an idea of where the fires are, but it vastly over exaggerates the size of any given fire.

Edit: if the black dot for LA is too small, then the fire dots become slightly more accurate. There is no scale on this map. It's shit."
