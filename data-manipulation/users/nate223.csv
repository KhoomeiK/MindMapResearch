Because you know everyone of them would have said something about some kind of social justice nonsense that these celebrities preach. The climate is going to kill everyone yet I’ll still fly my private jets, if you’re rich you’re automatically a horrible person even though I’m stupid rich, there are 45 genders, things like that.

funny,fdd0pc7,t1_fdd0i68,1578290212.0,But what he’s saying is that they are all leftist hypocrites. They all are left leaning and they all express their left leaning views on social media and he was preaching against that. That’s how I took it.

BlackPeopleTwitter,fbzu6om,t1_fbztezz,1577261743.0,"Look you’ve made some great points and I think I have as well. I believe we can both agree that higher education is very important to this country. Also I believe bipartisanly, if that’s a word, that eduction is messed up in this country. People need to work together to fix the issue, I’m on board with that. But both sides are guilty of greed. Washington revolves around money and even the most seemingly innocent of issues has a monetary reason behind the derivative. Maybe one day we can fix that kind of toxic culture in our society that removes truth from politicians mouths and turns them into marionettes with a price tag. I will always lean right and it sounds like you will always lean left and that’s ok as long as we can come to some sort of agreement. But I’ll never stand for a party that preaches how college should be free and it’s too expensive when they are the ones in control of the price itself. (You say differently and well that’s ok it’s Christmas, fuck it I don’t want to argue)"
