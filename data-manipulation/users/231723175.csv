IncelTears,ffg72gx,t1_ffg3ywz,1579899856.0,"intersex is an umbrella term for several conditions that lead to a child being born with physical characteristics of both sexes. This can be XY chromosomes with female outward development due to hormones, or chromosomes like XXY or just one X or many other different conditions. They have in common that the physical sex cannot be 100% determined to be either male or female.

Intersex people often get operated on as children for cosmetic purposes to be made to fit a mould and many end up being raised in a body that feels wrong and having to have useles surgeries they never wanted. Some get similar procedures to trans people to ""reverse"" the damage that has been done."
