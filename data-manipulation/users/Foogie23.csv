Idk, I don’t blame toast. Dude found a way to stop streaming and retire after a few more years. Let’s not act like we’d not do the same thing (at least I won’t act like that because I’d definitely do what he did)."
hearthstone,ffhv1kk,t1_ffgvvsh,1579955234.0,Facebook gave toast enough money to retire when his contract is done. I don’t know how you can call that dumb...he is getting the money with 100% certainty.

leagueoflegends,febvn9t,t1_febusr9,1578963254.0,It could be the explanation. Rank doesn’t matter MMR matters. So while his rank is lower his mmr could have been higher.
