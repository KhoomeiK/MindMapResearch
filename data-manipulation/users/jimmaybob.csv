dataisbeautiful,ffhjpwe,t1_ffh88h9,1579938389.0,"I understand natural law to mean absolute fact of the universe, something that is objective. Any distribution of wealth is not a natural fact of the universe, it's contingent."
aww,ffgzxse,t1_ffgzfhq,1579919408.0,"Okay that's great that isn't what you were claiming. The reason why they're allowed on flights has no relation to their status as a form of public transit.

So I was right, you were making that up/assuming it and it's actually a different reason."
dataisbeautiful,ffgzv1i,t1_ffgzq6m,1579919351.0,In what psychological context is it relevant
aww,ffgyswp,t1_ffgyq9q,1579918554.0,"Find a source stating the reason service animals are being allowed on planes has anything relation to airlines being subject to rules relating to public transit.

Because to me it sounds like your simply assuming/making this up based on other pieces of knowledge you have"
aww,ffgxgly,t1_ffgt8lq,1579917565.0,A dog itself in the living flesh is not realistically worse for dog allergies than merely a person who has been exposed to a dog? Yeah sorry that's absolutely not fucking true.
aww,ffgxeyi,t1_ffgx15q,1579917515.0,Really helpful if you have a connection
aww,ffgxbih,t1_ffgwgda,1579917443.0,That sounds like you absolutely made that up. I'd like to see literally *any* source at all claiming this is why dogs are allowed on planes now

Is there anyway to put the opposite of /s on my comment?"
dataisbeautiful,ffgskfh,t1_ffgn8t1,1579913972.0,"It's not wrong to be concerned primarily with justice in your own country before others, because you have more proximate relation and control to your own community.

Secondly, I can guarantee you the *vast* majority of Bernie supporter would enthusiastically support sending more economic aid to poverty stricken nations than supporters of any other presidential candidate"
dataisbeautiful,ffgseqq,t1_fffpsg5,1579913857.0,There is no natural law of wealth distribution you astronomically dumb fuck

dataisbeautiful,ffgsc3r,t1_ffgk4bp,1579913804.0,Yeah because there's no ontological difference between a webpage and a human life
billsimmons,ffg5ydc,t1_ffg5ovx,1579899167.0,"I literally have found official sources saying the exact opposite of what you're claiming. Give the fuck up

Let me know when you die from choking on a button you fucking obstinate moron"
billsimmons,ffg5ajc,t1_ffg36ei,1579898763.0,"Yes, that's exactly what BPM measures. Once again 


""BPM -- Box Plus/Minus
A box score estimate of the points per 100 possessions a player contributed above a league-average player, translated to an average team.""

You're fucking retarded

Another source from bref


""BPM is a stat derived from a player's box score stats, such as points, rebounds, and assists, **combined with team performance**"""
billsimmons,ffg2ous,t1_ffg29gk,1579897161.0,"It was not what I said it was because I used a single incorrect word. If I had simply said ""average team"" instead of ""the hawks"" youd have no contention

AND GIVEN THE FACT THE HAWKS ARE A BELOW AVERAGE TEAM IM STILL FUCKING RIGHT. IF HE CONTRIBUTES MORE THAN AVERAGE TO AN AVERAGE TEAM THAT WOULD ALSO APPLY TO BELOW AVERAGE TEAMS"
billsimmons,ffg2iss,t1_fff5qdv,1579897056.0,Who is excusing it? Not a single fucking person. Reasons aren't excuses. That's a line of thinking we need to leave in the past
billsimmons,ffg2fy4,t1_fffyrsy,1579897007.0,"What an incredibly unscientific way of thinking. Okay sure some people that probably have CTE are entirely fine. 

If CTE increases your likelihood of engaging in behaviors and patterns of thought that are conducive to murder, and lets say a person with CTE is twice as likely to murder than someone without it, which would still be a very low murder rate, then we should absolutely say CTE contributes to violent criminal behavior. Even in this situation the vast majority of people with CTE would not commit murders even though CTE is a contributing factor towards being likely to murder.

Fucking hell learn to use your brain"
billsimmons,ffg1vjg,t1_ffg1qy9,1579896657.0,"There are stats that tell you if a play helps his team perform better than the average player would on the average team, which BPM shows. It's like a basketball version of WAA. So its actually a very fucking useful stat.

So fucking funny youre out here telling me to chill when you wont give it up either"
billsimmons,ffg1mfp,t1_ffg1izo,1579896500.0,"Considering the Hawks are a below average team, in this case that exactly what it's fucking telling you use your brain shithead"
billsimmons,ffg1au7,t1_ffg15il,1579896299.0,"Okay sorry I misspoke and its actually the ""average team"" and not the Hawks in particular. That's a pretty minor fucking mistake and you were out here making it seem like I didnt know shit"
billsimmons,ffg0wti,t1_ffg0tcq,1579896060.0,That is absolutely what it tells you. It tells you the Hawks perform better when he is on the floor than they would without him. Holy fuck just give up you fucking retard
billsimmons,ffg0oce,t1_fffz89w,1579895918.0,"No, you thought BPM wasn't a rate stat, which it is. That was not your contention. You were fucking wrong.

It absolutely does take into account the average team +/- read the fucking stat. I know you got shit for brains I didn't know you were fucking blind too"
billsimmons,fffyoe3,t1_fffuxpy,1579894687.0,"""BPM -- Box Plus/Minus

Maybe you should do *your* research fucking moron"
