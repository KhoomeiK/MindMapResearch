No, no, no. Slow down there. This is terrible advice that will get you fucking killed. Not all martial arts are created equal. If you're learning a martial art just for self discipline and just to train and exercise, that's one thing. But if you want to learn a martial art to be able to defend yourself in a real fight then you REALLY need to do your homework and research which one is the best and what has the best real world applications. A lot of traditional eastern martial arts are simply not practical in real life in terms of survival, they may seem impressive to an outsider but they're not practical. Most asian martial arts started out as a way of self discipline and shaping people into a better physique and was part of a philosophy of meditation and self actualization like  the ancient Shaolin monks. It has ***nothing*** to do with beating people up or winning fights. People just assume Kung-Fu is about kicking ass because they watched some movies about it and think it can help in a real fight when in reality it can't.

When I learned Karate my teacher even admitted that there's a very fine line between martial arts that's helpful in a real fight versus learning a rehearsed dance that you just do over and over again. And you just assume that it will come in handy in a fight. But then when you try to actually use it, its worthless against a guy who will fight dirty and use a knife or a broken bottle or his gang of friends will come over and fuck you up. There aren't any rules in a streetfight, its not a dojo. There's a reason why Bruce Lee wanted to incorporate as many different fighting styles from around the world. Including western fighting like boxing and was interested in Muhammad Ali because he knew there were some weaknesses with Asian martial arts. You cannot say with a straight face that a wing chung guy has the same potential of survival as a black belt brazillian jiu-jitsu/MMA fighter. They're completely different forms of fighting. You're culpable in people dying if you sincerely believe that.

Case in point: [look at this video of a Chinese MMA guy beating the shit out of these old ""grand masters"" who claim they're the best at wing chung or kung fu.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Xd2MUJSil4) They're not prepared because its a completely different fighting style. One is better than the other."

Look at old paintings and illustrations of warrior women like the Valkyries from Norse mythology. Its hardly a modern trend. Being able to take care of yourself physically and maintain self discipline isn't a negative thing and shouldn't be seen as one anyway. It just demonstrates you're capable of being physically fit. You seemed shocked that men take interest in women who are physically attractive like its some new revelation.

Also I like how you describe down-to-earth and low maintenance as bad things when in reality it just means you're easier to be around other people and therefore more likely to have a boyfriend.

But I felt like with this, he didn't spend enough time talking to male clients about why they choose to see them and it just dismissed them or acted like their reasons for seeing them were trivial and not relevant. And overall it felt more like it was trying to instill a sense of concern or fear of sex work being allowed or legal or that all escorts are being exploited regardless if its consensual and agreed upon. Its truly sad what happened to these women when they were younger and there probably is a connection, but at the same time if sex work became illegal again it would just go back to the bad old days of pimps and organized crime and we would see much more abuse and deaths. I feel like the women he's chosen to interview were selected because of their background and history of abuse. And I don't think they're representative of all sex workers. Particularly the married couple; Graham and Caroline who just seem more like eccentrics and Caroline is just a classic narcissist who always wants attention and doesn't care that she's hurting Graham which had nothing to do with sex work and she was always going to be narcissistic regardless of her job.
