AskTrumpSupporters,fffjbat,t1_fffhnr4,1579885185.0,"The fact that the CPI-U-RS has grown faster than the IPD in recent decades simply means that prices of goods and services consumed by households have risen more rapidly than a basket of output in the IPD (a basket that includes these consumption items as well as goods and services purchased by businesses and governments).  Do you understand why this means that, on similar pay structures, consumers are being compensated with less effective consumer-level purchasing power?  Especially since IPD doesn't count imports, which factors into a substantial percentage of consumer-level purchases (think gas prices especially), making IPD, at best, misleading.

Too many analysts looking at this divergence in price series jump immediately to the conclusion that the CPI-U-RS must be overstating inflation, and resort to essentially giving all American workers a raise (at least in their spreadsheets) by deciding to deflate wages by the IPD. The case is at least as strong that the IPD is understating price growth (and hence overstating output and productivity growth), and that one should instead deflate the productivity series by a consumer price series to get a measure of “usable” productivity growth—or productivity growth that actually boosts American living standards.

CPI rising considerably faster than IPD measurements means a weakened consumer purchasing power for similar levels of productivity, let alone the vastly increased levels consumers offer to businesses nowadays.  

What's interesting, especially, is that your carefully truncated graph does not show the fact that productivity, wages, CPI and IPD were tightly coupled between 1948 and 1973, and then a sharp diversion between these measurements' relative growth rates occurred from that time period on.  Why is that?

EDIT: I Also just noticed that the IPD number is with ""Total Compensation"", while the CPI number is with ""average hourly wages"" - can you explain to me what, exactly, goes into the ""Total Compensation"" for those making, say, less than 200% of the federal poverty line?  It seems like a method to allow those making significantly more than minimum wage (aka, those not heavily affected by minimum wage changes) to even more heavily skew the IPD number, hiding the effect of the working poors' lack of significant non-cash compensation on the disparity between compensation and productivity as an aggregate.  I'm reluctant to outright say ""fake news"", but you have to admit that's misleading to compare two very different measurements like that, and try to pretend it's just comparing IPD vs CPI."

I'm probably gonna get a third monitor, but I don't wanna be too ridiculous.

I have reasonable graphics/CPU (Ryzen 1600x, GTX 1080Ti), but my monitors are poopy butts (15 year old 24 inch Sceptre and a 40 inch LG TV), so I'm thinking of getting a pretty nice (sub-1k, above-500) monitor.

  
Should I go for a 4k 60hz monitor, or a 1080p 144hz monitor?  Or are 4k 144's within my price range?  I've been shopping around, but I really don't know which is a bigger improvement - going to 4k, or going to 144hz.  Opinions/thoughts/heated arguments?"

Fake people know how to talk and be perceived as 'enlightened' or intellectual - mimicking vocal patterns, appearing to be in thoughtful deliberation, appearing to be deeply thinking, etc.
