stripper,ffyde57,t1_ffyd975,1580343752.0,How common is prostitution? Lmao Idk. If that’s what you’re looking for be up front about it. Women who provide those services will let you know what’s on the table.
stripper,ffyd06y,t1_ffyctzq,1580343491.0,"I’m not one of them so I couldn’t tell you. The point was mostly that it is common, and it seems like that’s what the girl in your story is looking for."
stripper,ffycg6t,t1_ffycdcm,1580343118.0,They have money and like company. Not all men are completely driven by sex.
stripper,ffy87kt,t1_ffxbtdd,1580340464.0,LOTS of regular step club customers pay thousands of dollars to take dancers to dinner and expect nothing more. It’s relatively common.
stripper,ffy7ptm,t1_ffy7njr,1580340186.0,Then don’t go? Go if you want to? Idk why you think we can help decide this for you.
stripper,ffy7l8v,t3_evvbm3,1580340111.0,"Idk, how far do you want to go?"
Instagramreality,ffw17z7,t3_eubdlw,1580280076.0,...did she... delete her knee? Are knees bad now?
stripper,ffueeam,t3_ev1x28,1580240209.0,"For it to be more profitable than a vanilla job it takes time to learn and also the luck of being in the right area. If the risks of dancing aren’t worth $15/hour don’t do it anymore. I wouldn’t dance for that. You could be devoting your time to a career instead, it sounds like dancing would be holding you back more than anything. You can always show up to dance for fun every once in awhile if you just like the performance aspect. Or pick up a performance based hobby.

Edit: typo"
stripper,ffudz7l,t3_ev3wt1,1580239957.0,"Some clubs won’t give you a locker for an audition but like, is it going to hurt you to bring a lock either way? Usually you’ll leave your stuff out with house mom or something. I doubt you’ll make so much money on your audition that you need a bag. Lol."
stripper,ffpwo89,t3_euk2fg,1580108666.0,"I know Kennedy Hodges handles these cases nationally. You most likely will be able to sue for unpaid hourly wages and the repayment of all house fees. Give them a call if you want to go that route. As far as I understand it’s difficult for a club to win these cases, most of them settle."
stripper,ffpvfns,t3_euk24l,1580107219.0,That’s so weird they don’t let you. My club will announce that they are running low on ones and need dancers to turn them in. Lol.
stripper,ff9suzb,t3_esbkgq,1579720511.0,"5’10. I’ve seen dancers up to 6’1. Men loooove that shit. And most strippers are taller than the customers in pleasers anyway. Just rock it, girl."
mildlyinteresting,ff8bb1w,t1_ff7t3nt,1579671696.0,"Idk, I have two dogs that look just like OP’s and they basically repel dirt and mud. They will roll in actual mud and look almost spotless after they run around a bit."
stripper,ff70sw7,t1_ff70lxs,1579638846.0,Some guys might ask you to take them off but you can just say something about the glue hurting to take off or something. I see lots of girls wearing pasties all night and not having an issue.
stripper,ff6zy4d,t1_ff6z0hz,1579638349.0,^This. With pasties you could work in full nude clubs even and no one would bat an eye.
