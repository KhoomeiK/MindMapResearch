CPTSD,ffmf838,t3_ets2vh,1580053753.0,"I can share my experience.  After a nervous breakdown a doctor added a stimulant (Vyvanse) to my anti depressant.  For some people, this addition cuts through the depression.  I did not realize it, but it made my hypomanic.  I had racing thoughts I could not stop.  I felt like there was a hamster wheel in my brain that never stopped.  I expended a lot of mental energy and got no where.  It was like I was trying to solve things that couldn't be solved over and over again.  Once I was off of that medication and put on a mood stabilizer, that stopped.  I hope you find your solution.  It is very hard to stop, even with the great interventions you have been trying."

When my kids were younger I was very sensitive to people discussing my parenting. I was insecure. It sounds like one child internalizes stress and the other externalizes it. Maybe normalizing this could be helpful. Behavior is communication. Could you ask your friend things like “what do you think she is trying to tell you?”  Also, try to praise the children when you see them. Point out their strengths. Instead of saying “that’s good”, be specific. “You used so many colors on your drawing.  I really like that”.  “I just caught you sharing with your brother, what a great sister you are.”  Perhaps modeling theses strategies will rub off on your friend."

Also as a teen, my best friend was murdered. That is what fueled my eating. I am not insinuating anything regarding your daughter. However, maybe she would benefit from counseling. Does she have peers?  Is the weight impacting her self esteem?  Those are issues someone can help her with. Also, my husband is a therapist who has treated eating disorders.

It was hard on our marriage.  We almost didn't make it.  He has CPTSD as well.  BUT with some open communication and really hard conversations, we got through it.  We have learned each other's triggers and do our best to be supportive.  The really hard lesson I have had to learn is that he cannot make up for the wounds I will forever carry.  He can never be attentive enough to fill that hole in my heart.  He can never assure me enough to keep me from fearing abandonment.  That is my stuff.  My wounds and I alone am responsible for healing and managing it.  I had to grow up emotionally.  It was hard.  I had a lot of panic attacks and flashbacks.  Love is possible.  Don't give up hope."

I would encourage you to be still and sit with yourself for a while with it.  Ponder it.  Even if it is true for you, it is something to be aware of.  Eating disorders are on a continuum.  From anorexia to compulsive overeating.  There is a lot in between.  I have an ED.  It was hard for me to admit it.  For a very long time.  Now that I have come to terms with it, I am able to have my blinders off to my thinking and behavior.  I have been overweight my entire life.  In my sick brain, I envy those who can become anorexic. That is twisted.  I know.  I apologize to those who live with anorexia.  I have to be very aware of the tendency to go the other direction.

I know some 12 step programs have this phenomena as a part of their program.  It is something I discovered about myself.  If I am going to eat something that has those ingredients, I try to do it outside of my home, with one serving and make it a part of my calories for the day.  I don't do cheat days.  I am not saying you shouldn't.  I just know for me, that mindset opens me up for ""cheating"" on other days as well.

loseit,fcqz9bs,t3_eii9w6,1577894440.0,"I started at 299 in November.  I am 5'4"".  I agree that needing to lose 150 pounds is daunting.  I have been involved with a doctor on a low calorie diet.   It is expensive though and I need to transition to a plan on my own.  I have lost 23.5 pounds.  That seems small compared to the amount I have to lose.  BUT I realized it is 1/6 of my goal.  That is pretty darn good for 2 months.  One day at a time.  We can do this.  Feel free to message me.  I don't have fancy answers but I am a good cheerleader."
loseit,fcqx222,t3_eigz8p,1577893520.0,Thank you!  This is very helpful.
loseit,fcqw11z,t1_fcpf10m,1577893065.0,"Exactly.  It may take 2 years to get to my goal.  Two years will go by either way.  I can be at my goal, or likely be bigger than I am now."
loseit,fcqvtuy,t1_fcpumnq,1577892976.0,Thank you.  These are great ideas.  I never have thought of using them when I am in emotional distress.  I am certainly keeping these in my tool box.
loseit,fcp5vt0,t1_fcoy9gu,1577851482.0,Thank you. I’m figuring that out for myself.
loseit,fcoy6ac,t1_fcnzs5n,1577844839.0,It’s been a tough day. However I lost another 3.5 pounds over the Christmas holiday week. Now it’s a total of 23.5!
loseit,fcoy3s7,t1_fcoo9u4,1577844781.0,That means a lot.
loseit,fcoy36t,t1_fcnnavu,1577844768.0,Thank you. I’m using those coping skills. Today I drank a ton of water.
