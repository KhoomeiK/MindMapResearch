Others working on the floor loose their jobs.

Bob loses his job to a Chinese worker but isn't able to obtain a new higher tech job because, let's face it, Bob is 50 and he's competing with Kamal from India. The cost of making Joe's toys has gone down significantly but pricing has not directly reflected these changes to production.
