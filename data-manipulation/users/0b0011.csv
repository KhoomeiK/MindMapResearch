I got bah at E-4 with a few months in my bah covered all of my rent and bills and my ~2000 a month on top of that was basically just fuck around money. I got 2 roommates because my best friend needed a place to stay and then a friend of ours came back from deployment and didn't want to stay on the ship and so that was another thousand or so in my pocket every month. Was pretty good money for the work when I was on the ship and was super fucking good money for the work when I was on shore duty working 16 hours a week and getting 2600 every 2 weeks in my paycheck.

gaming,fff1mgl,t1_fff0x1o,1579873214.0,I wouldn't really consider meeting up and working through something for fun the same as studying. I mean if you're taking a class on the middle East and you meet someone from the middle East and ask what it's like back home and what not would you consider that studying for your class? If you enjoy painting so you're taking a painting class and are focusing on specific aspects but get bored or studying that stuff so you decide to paint a picture is that studying for the class?
witcher,ffeztn5,t1_ffelzj1,1579871663.0,"He certainly blows some out of the water but he's not the best by far. What kind of stuff have you read? Sanderson has some amazing stuff if you haven't checked it out though he is religious so some fantasy tropes get downplayed or left out such as the main character banging everyone (which I usually find to be a pretty cringy trope anyways). If that's a no for you then many people love the kingkiller Chronicles though again with my cringe at that trope I'm not a huge fan of the second book where he spends a huge section in another world banging a sex demon or whatever because he's just so amazing at it and then she lets him go so he can bang other people and have someone to compare her to. Wheel of Time has an incredible story and some pretty rich world building spanning 15 books and where as many books fail at the ending it has a very satisfying one with a battle that's just about as long as several of the Witcher books alone. If you can get passed a meh first book Malazan book of the fallen is very good. Robin Hobb has some pretty great books as well that are pretty easy to get into it you aren't into the whole epic fantasy 1500 page book with hundreds of pages of world building. If dark fantasy is your thing then Joe Abercrombie's first law books leave the Witcher in the dust. 

The Witcher books are very good but I see a lot of people who have never read pick up them up and then not read anything else when really they should be using them as a great entry point into the hobby and springboard into other great series."

witcher,ffeyi17,t1_ffem6fe,1579870430.0,"The games did change quite a bit of cannon themselves. They brought two main character back from the dead, they added a ton of monsters(obviously for gameplay) when the books make it clear they're actually pretty rare in the world, they turned the wild hunt into ghost creatures though turned it back. They turned the ice age into some beatable force."
witcher,ffexz12,t1_ffeuanz,1579869915.0,I mean that his interpretation of the voice so there's nothing wrong with that. The books don't really get into what his voice sounds like aside from saying he taught himself a rivian accent.
witcher,ffexvpz,t1_ffeibq7,1579869826.0,Not really it just means they're getting more popular. I'd they weren't super popular before they probably didn't have a huge stock of them. As an example Barnes and Noble is the biggest bookstore near me and had 1 copy of each Witcher book and like 20+ of each asoiaf book so if 2 people come in to buy the Witcher books 1 is going to leave disappointed where as if 10 come in to buy the asoiaf books they'll all be fine.
witcher,ffexizc,t1_ffebc9a,1579869475.0,Good job for starting with the last wish. Back when I first read them 5 or 6 years ago everyone kept saying to start with blood of elves and I was like wtf is all this shit until someone said to ignore what people are saying and start with the last wish.
AskReddit,ffex52w,t1_ffevcyp,1579869081.0,"I was actually talking to my girlfriend about that yesterday. I feel like the moving thing is part of why companies in a lot of those areas offer so much great stuff. They're either trying to attract a workforce that moves or trying to keep there's so they have to be more competitive with wages and benefits and what not. Here you don't get a whole lot of people moving in and the people that are moving for awesome jobs or a more exciting area, more unique restaurants etc are moving away in droves so you've got the people who just want to live in/near the town they grew up in and their family likely still lives in so instead of having to compete with all the nicer places they just compete amongst themselves. 

It's kind of a circle with tech stuff. We don't have a whole lot of spectacular jobs in the area so the people that want to work on New tech move off and on the people that don't much care and just want a job to pay bills stay. This causes jobs to not move to the area which again leads to people moving away for nice jobs. When Amazon was doing that HQ2 thing people were trying to get them to move to Detroit and they looked into it but at the end of the day said no because there wasn't enough tech talent in the area in spite of UofM being a pretty good school for CS but it just happens that a lot of kids graduate from there and see what's around and then what is being offered elsewhere and move away to places like San Francisco or Austin."
gaming,ffewgco,t1_ffeslyj,1579868366.0,I dunno about that man. College is easy as fuck and if you pay attention in class and what not theres not much studying required. Especially if it's something you really enjoy. As an example I've taken a few algorithm classes and have never studied for any of them but it's not super necessary because it's super interesting and I've for 2 colleagues at work who are super into that stuff so we get coffee for an hour or so every morning and work our way through a few brain teasers from interviews or leet code problems. If you're the kind of person who tries to sit a row or two back in class and doesn't ever answer questions or ask for clarification then sure you may need to study a bit but at that point what's the point of going to school.

AskReddit,ffehjl4,t1_ffe1tsz,1579848262.0,"This is what I'm talking about though. The places are not in the Midwest and the ones that are in the Midwest like that are the exact thing the guy was talking down on before. Places like that are falling over themselves and offering good pay and benefits but in most of the Midwest (Chicago for example would be an exception but again is a bit different than the Midwest he was talking about) but in most of the Midwest places are trying to pay shit wages and offer shit benefits compared to those places. I'm moving to Austin in the summer partly for this reason. Got a job lined up there that I didn't have to even negotiate on much because right off the bat they were like full paid health care, great wages for the area at twice the average home income (home not individual) 3 weeks of vacation the first year etc. But in most of the Midwest (especially the places op was talking about with the typical low cost of living and no 5 star restaurants) they scoff of you mentioned it. You've got companies here bragging about their half hour lunch being paid and the 3 10 min. Breaks you get through the day and then you're got cities in the costs and cities like Denver/Boulder/Austin that are like just get your work done and take breaks whenever you want a break or hell work from home as much as you want but come in to the office once a week.

Sorry to ramble it's late and my kid woke me up. Point is that exactly like you mentioned there are places all over the country willing to pay great wages and offer great benefits and most of the Midwest aside from a few small pockets in the areas that most people aren't saying has nothing (again Chicago) most employers here ignore the places offering great benefits and instead try to pass shit ones because all the other companies in the area are or because that's what they give to their less in demand workers."
news,ffeg4y5,t1_ffdsy9e,1579846706.0,No idea but I've heard of it. I've seen grocery stores with baggers that work for tips but many people would find it silly to tip your cashier or grocery bagger.

AskReddit,ffdx37l,t1_ffdtqsv,1579831081.0,"Having moved all over the us with the military and having traveled to over 40 countries and now living in the Midwest we really don't have much of that and I went to quite a few of those nice things because I had money saved and would be now because I make pretty good money. Once the semester wraps up and I finish my masters in heading west. Sure the Midwest is cheap but it's a shit hole and everywhere seems to be stuck in the 90s. I had a recruiter from a company contact me and try to sell the fact that they get to wear jeans as a bonus or something like it shouldn't be the standard right from the start. Mention that you'd like a few weeks of vacation a year and people's jaws drop and it's not just jobs either, I've mentioned to family what I'm looking for and what's industry standard elsewhere and had them tell me I'm being greedy and it's a give and take like I'm supposed to accept shit wages and shit benefits and be happy with it because it's what people offer in the area.

As for jobs there really isn't much in my area. If I look on LinkedIn for the programming language I prefer there are 0 jobs in Michigan for it and if I look up something like Java there are more but it's sad when I can look up specific cities and they'll have 150% of what my whole state has.

Not to mention the jobs that are here pay shit. I've had people offer me $25 an hour like it's some fucking once in a lifetime thing while I'm making $50 working remote while going to school. The sad thing is that most people I know here would be drooling at $25."

When we have guests over she's nowhere to be seen and generally she mostly does her own thing (she likes to spend her days in our closet) but when she wants cuddles she's very forceful and insistent that she gets her cuddles. She also doesn't do some of the things that other cats normally do. For example domestic cat's meow to get our attention even though generally they stop as kittens and I've never heard her meow since she was a few weeks old.

aww,ffck6tu,t1_ffcgczk,1579801203.0,It's not terrible if the gene pool is wide enough and you go elsewhere to make sure that there is decreased chance of having close ancestry. There is a breeder I used to follow who would do this. She would say that if a breeder has both dogs it's a bad sign and you should run and she'd contact breeders from all over the world to make sure that she found the best match for the dog. She also waited till the dog was 4 or 5 and got a bunch of health exams as well as showing the dogs so that a bunch of experts would make sure there weren't faults like weak hips that would be passed on and if her dogs failed any of that she didn't breed them and when she did she'd only breed the dogs once in their lifetime. This resulted as a liter once every 8 or so years and her charging 5-6 thousand for a puppy. I used to want a puppy from her but the waiting list was quite long and her last liter was only like 2 pups so it would realistically never happen in my lifetime(or more likely hers since she was/is quite old).

They can develop silly habbits too like my brother used to collect interesting rocks and one of the coons would steal them and then pile them up in the living room and sometimes bring rocks in from outside for it's little pile if the door was open.

Afterwards a neighbor shot a female to stop her from killing his chickens and then a few days later heard her kits up in a tree crying. The original 2 we got were probably 2 or 3 days old when we got them so they were always super tame and the others were several weeks old and we're kinda wild.

therewasanattempt,ffayfql,t1_ffac1xl,1579747391.0,True. Besides you never know if they were adopted or something like that. It's possible an asian couple adopted a white baby and gave him an asian name.
witcher,ffawti0,t1_ffaphbr,1579746324.0,mob psycho 100 is written by the same guy who wrote one punch man and both seasons are spectacular.
witcher,ffawr0y,t1_ffaoby1,1579746278.0,For what it's worth when people refer to anime they're generally talking about stuff a lot closer to Berserk and Goblin Slayer. Granted yea it's just the japanese word for animation but people have kinda tightened the definition. Even just saying that one of the qualifications is that it must be japanese is already a restriction on the defintion.
witcher,ffawb08,t1_ffam7ad,1579745980.0,"Well seeing as they use the word to refer to all animation, since that's their word for animation, it would make sense."
witcher,ffaw79p,t1_ffalz8n,1579745912.0,More specifically it's usually japanese animation that follows some pretty tightly defined rules. Many people in the states would not consider japanese children like Crayon Shin-chan or hello kitty to be anime for some reason.
nottheonion,ffa7hti,t1_ff9xdeh,1579729381.0,Ever hear of the military? Not only are there hair and makeup standards by gender but uniform stuff too like men and women have the same uniform but women have a few options that the men aren't allowed to have.

gaming,ff9o3is,t1_ff9mi3n,1579717047.0,"Fair enough. 

I think that if your going to to do that then like you said the starter guns should at least be somewhat close to as powerful.

I still think Halo 3 did it great."
gaming,ff9ntqq,t1_ff9mky2,1579716887.0,"I'm not referring to cosmetics. I didn't remember MW2 having unlockable cosmetics because I thought they were always available. What I'm talking about is the he actual guns and upgrades that you could unlock. When MW2 came out me and some buddies got a place together. We had a few friends who stayed and weren't working where as I was working 84 hours a week(4-4 7 days a week because factory jobs suck dick). I was great at fps games at the time due to having spent hours and hours a day playing before I got a job but once I was only able to play maybe 1 match a night if I was lucky I started having a hard time competing in the same level when I would play with my buddies that didn't work. Switching accounts with them showed that a large part of it was because I was still using shitty guns and playing with/against people with great guns because I was topping the boards again when using their account and guns.

Games should not be designed so that you have to pay to compete but they should not be designed so that you need to have a bunch of time playing to compete. Something like overwatch minus the rng is great because you still unlock nice things but players aren't handicapped because they've got less free time.

Another good example would be Halo 3 where you could unlock gear but everyone had access to every gun because they were just on the map.

That being said it's less participation trophy and more saying each side should play on the same footing. I mean it would be like if in basketball they were like well this team has played more games than you so their 2 pointers now count as 3 or your basket now drops 3 feet lower than theirs."
gaming,ff9mhih,t1_ff9lwe3,1579716091.0,Not having different varieties of weapon skins doesn't. Having shitty weapons where as the people you play against does.
gaming,ff9ma2y,t1_ff8xap3,1579715968.0,"Eh, I dunno. I've never seen an adult only game being sold anywhere."
gaming,ff9m6gw,t1_ff8vcnd,1579715910.0,Since basically no place physical or digital well sell them.
gaming,ff9ln5v,t1_ff9j2tc,1579715594.0,And it punished people who didn't have much time to play. If the game isn't an RPG then the items should be either all accessable or there should be an option to buy them if you don't have as much time up play but don't want to be handicapped.
Justfuckmyshitup,ff9fbyw,t1_ff96hnb,1579711802.0,She was like 40. Probably just a lot of testosterone.
WTF,ff94v35,t1_ff8mjbx,1579704887.0,People only look for cars while driving. I take the lane at intersections on my bike now because people don't pay attention and I've been hooked twice. When running I'll occasionally have someone try to turn and then slam on the breaks when they see me crossing because they were only paying attention to the road to see if it was clear of cars enough for them to turn.
gaming,ff93ihg,t1_ff916h9,1579703953.0,"Sorry I thought you were the person I originally responded to. I'm of the opinion that any game of pure chance is gambling from booster packs in hearthstone, to booster packs of Pokemon cards at Walmart, to whatever the fuck they're called in overwatch or battlefront 2."
gaming,ff8zl8f,t1_ff8ymmj,1579701001.0,"The article mentions 9 countries. 1 doesn't go either way, 3 flat out say it's not gambling, 2 say that the ones where you can sell/trade items are gambling but if you can't then they're not. 1 country makes them show the odds, I country is looking at maybe limiting them and one country outright bans them. 

So now if we're going to say China banned them so they must be gambling then I have to ask why their opinion is more reliable than all the countries in the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium that say it's not?"
gaming,ff8y5eb,t1_ff8x8eb,1579699838.0,"The UK (3 countries) came out and said it's not gambling at all. The Netherlands and Belgium said that they're gambling if you can trade/sell what you get but if you're stuck with what you get then it's not gambling.

Which countries have ruled it gambling?"
funny,ff8xutr,t1_ff8eilv,1579699590.0,I think it's the window glass. They claim that the windows bend light and make it look round.

worldnews,ff8xbr7,t1_ff8serr,1579699131.0,Most things people eat are from other places. I think I eat beef more than I do tomatoes even though I live in North America and not the fertile crescent. I had chicken last night for dinner and I'm not living in South East Asia. It's crazy how interconnected we all are.
gaming,ff8wzcw,t1_ff8wg50,1579698827.0,Not all microtransactions are loot boxes. It doesn't have to be an all or nothing approach. We can say X is bad but it doesn't mean we should ban Y even though they use the same underlying mechanism.
gaming,ff8ws5o,t1_ff8wkdz,1579698647.0,If no one bought Pokemon red then all the Pokemon that were exclusive to that game were locked behind a paywall. It's been a thing with Pokemon from the start. I managed to get every single Pokemon including mew when I was younger with the exception of Magmar because he wasn't in my version and I couldn't find anyone to trade one with.
gaming,ff8wmt8,t1_ff8sb0i,1579698515.0,You downplay his thing and ask how many exist and then bring up a group that is probably much smaller. I would almost be willing to bet that there are more kids work parents with enough money to let them blow then there are adults taking out loans for microtransactions and going into debt (though they do probably exist). The vast majority of people spending money on these are doing fine and of the ones that spend too much most are not putting themselves into debt but rather using money they should be using for other things (though that's still not good).
gaming,ff8wb7z,t1_ff8vk0g,1579698227.0,And anyone can have those ones. The dlc just adds extra story content which opens new areas where different ones can be caught. It's been a thing since gen one where you can only catch certain Pokemon on your version.
