udub,ffg1cu9,t3_et8anr,1579896333.0,"Copying a post I made a day or two ago... “Greek life has the majority of the parties. Outside of that, some clubs/RSO’s throw events occasionally. Any other parties tend to be smaller and organized within friend groups. UW on the whole isn’t a very party-centric school.”"
space,fffjmzi,t1_fffd4iq,1579885386.0,"Yeah but you’re not paying a contractor to try and invent a new way to roof your house. If Boeing did the work (spending huge amounts of time and money in the process) and for whatever reason both parties agree it’s not viable, what do you want them to do? Continue plowing ahead and spend even more?"
udub,ffbiocb,t1_ffbh56k,1579767100.0,"Shoutout to Tig for barely ID'ing obvious 18 year olds, plus having pretty decent food. Definitely times that my group were the only white people there though. On a serious note though, Morsel (which isn't really that far up the Ave) and Fat Duck Deli are both super solid food spots."

Frisson,ff8n5s5,t1_ff8k3n7,1579686909.0,"It’s inarguably a more peaceful world. Crime and violence are significantly down and people all across the world are (generally) living longer, healthier lives. It’s easy to get caught in the negativity (and there are  certainly a lot of legitimate reasons to be negative), but the world is on the whole a much better place than it was 50 years ago."
CitiesSkylines,ff8avdi,t1_ff86nui,1579671271.0,Colorado of course. Run Ralphie run.
CollegeBasketball,feo1uzp,t1_fenrrca,1579294048.0,3A Metro league is probably one of the best divisions of high school basketball in the country.
Wellthatsucks,felgu0i,t1_fel2qpn,1579221844.0,Or just someone who has multiple dogs and limited time.
baseball,fei8gt6,t1_fei7nql,1579132622.0,"Yeah, the last time the Mariners made the playoffs I was 3. I’m graduating college this spring."
Mariners,fei2x94,t1_fehb43a,1579129105.0,One of those is not like the other to be fair.
baseball,fecueoj,t1_fecl6vr,1578985016.0,And very few of them were good while here.
CFB,fecjdmp,t1_fecj7pm,1578975336.0,35-25 LSU w 5 min left in the 3rd.
CFB,fecjclg,t1_fecj7px,1578975317.0,They’ve been fine.
CFB,fecikq8,t1_feciizk,1578974789.0,They’ve highkey been doing a solid job. Pleasant surprise.
HumanPorn,fdjk9xt,t1_fdjcdhf,1578474818.0,Have this picture up when your boss walks past and tell me how it goes for you.
CFB,fdhxfdz,t1_fdhsk0y,1578431909.0,"As someone in Greek life at UW, I can confirm this. It’s great knowing a ton of people in the student section, but it’d also be cool to have more participation and school spirit from the non-Greek contingent at the school."
udub,fdephs4,t1_fddwali,1578343903.0,It is actually right about that high. It’s been bouncing around between 45-50% for the last couple years.
legostarwars,fdcak9v,t1_fdc3sol,1578270394.0,It was $90 IIRC
nfl,fdc6xcn,t1_fdc6n2n,1578268296.0,"The Clowney one should’ve been a flag, not anywhere close to an ejection though. Everything else is objectively wrong though so there’s no real point in arguing about it."
nfl,fdc637l,t1_fdc55p2,1578267831.0,Like that offside which would’ve given us a first down?
YouShouldKnow,fd5ht0c,t1_fd5fl6e,1578177811.0,The Browns have already been eliminated from contending for the championship so it’s impossible for them to win. The draft won’t happen.
udub,fd56r32,t3_ek32op,1578174751.0,Anyone who falls for this is a massive idiot.
YouShouldKnow,fd5403k,t1_fd53d6p,1578174003.0,Well yeah. Even if there’s a minuscule chance of something happening there’s still a chance. Modern warfare just doesn’t really require 10 million boots on the ground so there’s not much need for a draft. Not to mention how politically unpopular it’d be.
YouShouldKnow,fd50tss,t1_fd4za7s,1578173060.0,Around 2.2 million enlisted and reserves. The chances of a draft happening are only slightly better than the Browns winning this year’s super bowl.
thegrandtour,fd0jb91,t1_fd0ipuo,1578119639.0,"Ah shit, I just looked it up and you’re right :/"
thegrandtour,fczqts7,t1_fcyn10u,1578107030.0,He’s hilarious. The whole sequence of him and James in the gadget store was great. Really all of his time on screen was great.
CFB,fco9nlk,t3_ei8v9g,1577826916.0,Any Vandy fans have opinions on him? Our secondary was great when he was a grad assistant here so that’s a good sign I guess.
carporn,fco6jo2,t1_fco4ezj,1577825034.0,"Yeah for real. The overwhelmingly vast majority of people will never have a chance to own a GT40. If some guy loves the car and doesn’t have a spare million lying around, why not get a kit?"
CFB,fcaqc2s,t1_fcaqa30,1577574483.0,42-14 in the championship game to Alabama in 2012.
HumansBeingBros,fca0plj,t1_fc9z3wh,1577561088.0,"League minimum is about $600k. If he’s making that little he’s not actually on a full NBA contract. As another poster said he’s probably on a two-way, so he splits time between a lower developmental league and the NBA."
udub,fbylgwq,t1_fbyk4uz,1577219927.0,Yeah it’s generally a quite easy class. 111 is business algebra/pre-calc kinda stuff and 112 gets into pretty basic calculus. Just stay on top of things and treat like a real class and OP will be fine.
