This leads to situations where politicians with outdated views that don't actually reflect the voters anymore stay longer than they would otherwise with term limits."
todayilearned,ffjg8vm,t1_ffjanhk,1579997602.0,The record holder is 59 years in office.  I think that's insane and there should be a 20 or at most 30 year limit.  It would also help our legislature reflect more of what the people actually believe so we don't end in 2020 with marijuana STILL being federally illegal.
todayilearned,ffj9ahg,t1_ffj8r40,1579993465.0,"Yeah, being a politician isn't like being a doctor or a researcher where it takes years of training to be effective at your job.  You have an entire staff to help you with politically related technical details.

Whats important is your ability to understand the real world and the impact your votes has on it, something that Joe Grandpa, 20 time winner of Mississippi's 5th district, who doesn't understand how facebook makes money, doesn't have."

We are not asserting the statement as truth.

Therefore my post is accurate and not misleading.

Also here is an article showing that black women may in fact underreport rapes, likely as a consequence of distrust in the judicial system www.baltimoresun.com/citypaper/bcpnews-why-are-black-women-less-likely-to-report-rape-20150609-story.html%3foutputType=amp"

todayilearned,ff1yh3g,t1_ff1m21a,1579489088.0,"I'm on your side, and agree with a lot of what you are saying.  However, some of your statistics are one-sided or are intellectually dishonest.  I think when misleading claims are made it can hurt an otherwise convincing argument. In my mind, the point you are making is that the crime statistics of black people in the 21st century are directly driven by widespread institutional oppression in the 20th century leading to poverty and distrust of justice institutions in some sub-populations of black people.  I think you made this point really well with good specifics.  However regarding your stats:

* For example, your stats that white people commit 60% of all mass shootings.  White people are about 65% of the population in the us so this is actually less than the average.  This disproves your point.
* Regarding white men committing white on white crime at a 4 times higher rate than black on black crime. 
    1.  If you look at the table, all racial groups are more likely to be victimized by their own race than any other race.  This is mainly just due to proximity, as well as that a lot of crime is committed by people you know such as domestic crimes. 
    2.  The rates are total frequency not per capita.  There are about four times as many white people as black people.  
* Your stats about white people being imprisoned for 75% of all sexual assault cases, again this is only slightly above per capita average.  Additionally, this could also be due to black women under-reporting crimes against them i.e. 'snitches get stitches'"

environment,fetg7rh,t1_fesmtc3,1579375151.0,"Well actually you're wrong and here is a source showing that the lowest audit rates are for people between 25,000 and 200,000 
https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-are-the-odds-being-audited.html

The reason audit rates are high for people under 25000 is because they think you are more likely to be committing tax fraud or just not filing when you should be."
environment,fesirlc,t1_fes5g8q,1579365661.0,"The real breakdown between capitalism and communism is that in capitalism you end up with 1000 units of wealth (cars, clothes, houses, medicine as well as yachts, mansions, designer clothes) for 100 people. 

 But the poor (say the bottom 50%) only get 2 units of wealth, while the rich (upper 50%) get more, sometimes much more.

Then in communism, you end up with 100 units of wealth for 100 people, and the poor (bottom 90%) end up with .5 units of wealth, while the rich (top 10%) end up with 5.5 units of wealth.  

So in communism, you still end up with elites but its more equal because everyone gets to live in poverty equally.  

The problem with inequality in capitalism is NOT capitalism.  Capitalism's job is NOT to fight inequality, it is to create wealth.  Our politicians job is to find the optimal balance of creating wealth and taking it away from wealth creators to fight inequality (taxes).



The problem is legal systems where rich people get to spend their money on politicians and not have to pay taxes.  It is fucking obscene that we have people on minimum wage paying taxes built into their paycheck while the ultra-rich are using KNOWN TAX LOOPHOLES and overseas accounts to avoid paying ANY TAXES.  

And then they de-fund the IRS like they are doing US a favor.  The IRS does not care about Joe the Plumber making 50g a year.  They want to go after Joseph the Banker making 50m a year.  But they can't because Joseph and other people like him fund the politicians.  **The IRS actually makes MORE money for each dollar you give it.**

The first way for this is selection bias, you are only selecting the models which did well.  To be a true test you would have to select the models TODAY and then test ALL of them twenty years from now.


To explain more, imagine that you wrote a program to explain coin flips.  They wouldnt be worth shit because its random.
