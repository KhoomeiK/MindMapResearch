Also, many people who were fighting for civil rights in the 50’s and 60’s are still around now as are their kids and the scars of the institutionalized racism still exist in a very raw way to them. Acknowledging their organization’s previous misdeeds and apologizing for them would do much good in helping the country as a whole get past the racial divide that still exists today.
