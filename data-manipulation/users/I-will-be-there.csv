RebornDollCringe,ffegw50,t3_et1frs,1579847529.0,Read recently the USA passed a law making it illegal to sell child sex dolls.  This is sick stuff.  How long before some pervert isn’t satisfied with a doll anymore?
Botchedsurgeries,ffegjs9,t1_ffe4g3u,1579847152.0,That’s what I thought.  She told doc perky nibbles but he gave her sky watching.

avicii,ffeejtu,t3_esvnrz,1579845057.0,Actually hard to listen to.  I love Tim’s work but he was so particular about anything sounding just right.  I don’t think he would have approved.  I still listened and will listen again though.

awfuleverything,ffdcwnf,t3_esry5f,1579818221.0,Was that a real ad for bleach next to the story?  I have experienced thoughtless ads but nothing like this.  So glad the boy is going to be fine - as far as his eyes.  What is wrong with kids?  Did kids do such cruel things 40 or 50 years ago?
nextfuckinglevel,ff93klu,t3_esajp9,1579703996.0,Discipline and lots of practice.  Wonder how many fails while he worked up to that move.
MyPeopleNeedMe,ff92h9z,t1_ff8qv6d,1579703219.0,The west is identified by tumbling tumbleweeds but they were introduced around 1877 in seed from Russia.  That’s what they are Russian thistle.  Not enough bugs or animals eat them so they become a nuisance.  Some times they can block roads.

lgbt,ff7336p,t3_erwq67,1579640147.0,Boomer here.  Hasn’t been easy but we have always had lots of friends and just tried to avoid get in your face confrontation.  There’s so much freedom today.  Mostly now I can tell someone if you don’t like me don’t be around me but I’m not going any where.  Even accepting families had to hide their feelings.  I remember once at work a guy thought he was telling some secret when he meanly told the whole lunch room that another guy was gay- everyone’s reaction so we know and the guy who wanted to make trouble was shamed and fried shortly after.  Just because people don’t talk about gayness means they are accepting you for you not your sexual choice.  I haven’t said this as well as some could here but I hope you get some useful info.

scifi,ff0rxjo,t3_er1umf,1579471708.0,After the first one they were like an addiction you couldn’t stop watching.  Their ability to poke fun at themselves is part of what kept me watching.  If Burt isn’t back I believe I am finished.

peopleofwalmart,ferp132,t3_emiryg,1579356703.0,"Some states don’t charge rent.  As long as you park way out in the parking lot and don’t litter, noise etc. they let RVs and cars spend the night.

FoundPaper,fea5bmu,t3_eno7kn,1578944535.0,All the interpretations of a child’s drawing reminds me of when I was called to the school for my young son’s drawing of a monster with two heads.  A very good detailed color one too.  They went on about children who were abused drew monsters and two headed people.  When I could stop laughing at the teachers I told them that the drawing was a good one of one of the many monsters my son collects and the two heads came from his eyes- he wore thick corrective glasses and had two operations and it was getting better.  We made it a game and funny so he thought it was neat to draw things like he sees them.  A few questions would have been nice with out treating me like I was beating my son or that some vile person had done something to him.  I think they asked him and he gave them the same answers.  Nice to know that they cared but It shows not to jump to conclusions.  A child’s drawing is usually just that there view of the world.
Zeducation,fea23r0,t1_fe8so73,1578943572.0,Haven’t found any communities where I need karma but though I joke about not bothering with it it’s still nice to see the numbers climb.  Unfortunately I have a lot of time right now to look around and find what I think is interesting hoping that some of else will too.  Doesn’t happen often though.  Hang in there and comment and try to build some numbers that way.
