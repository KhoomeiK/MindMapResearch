Feminism,feto9do,t1_fetn0b8,1579377533.0,"I'm very aware of the oppression of women especially in certain countries, I  just find you're making an argument out of something that isn't a strong comparison and you fail to account for those differences and the fact that you're blocking  me for simply pushing back on your argument shows me you will not take anyone else's  perspective into account."

Also no I didn't claim breastfeeding isn't stigmatized in those countries but you're making an argument and providing sources to show how public urination is accepted without citing how breastfeeding is unaccepted in those countries in comparison."
Feminism,fetj02h,t1_ferwrmu,1579375938.0,"All these articles only cited public urination, if you want to prove a point you need to include articles  on the stigmatization of breastfeeding as well. Most of your articles are from India or China where homelessness is a huge factor. Of course India has a public urination problem, have you been to India? It is highly overpopulated and public bathrooms are hard to come by, same with China. There's beaches in India that are literally used as bathrooms.  

Your argument here has little credibility."
