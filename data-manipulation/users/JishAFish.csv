BikiniBottomTwitter,ffpqu9a,t1_ffpqb8w,1580102484.0,I respect that the man is dead and that is sad but what I’m saying is that whenever a celebrity dies people treat them like a saint but we can’t forget that these people also do terrible things.
BikiniBottomTwitter,ffpqkpn,t1_ffpo92k,1580102236.0,"Yes and the Californian fires are nothing compared to these Aussie fires. I’m not saying that what you lost is nothing im saying don’t lecture me on the Aussie fires and I won’t lecture you on the Cali fires.

You suggested that I’m a climate denier and have no experience with the fires. Memes didn’t start shit. Mr beast and mark river started the team trees campaign and reddit just talked about it. Also those clean up programs weren’t started by memes either they were started by good people doing more than making an image. I’m also part of your generation and use memes to talk about shit but I don’t pretend to claim that helps I actually do help"

BikiniBottomTwitter,ffpnhfx,t1_ffpibts,1580099531.0,You just inferred a lot of thing that are very wrong. I’m not a climate changer denier in anyway shape or form. Yes these fires will get worse and worse through the years but making memes won’t do shit to stop that. I have first hand experience with the fires as i have family members with their homes destroyed by these fires. Hell until two weeks ago I had cousins trapped on a beach fighting for their survival. I would assume that you are American and therefore have no experience with these fires so please don’t even attempt to lecture me on this matter
BikiniBottomTwitter,ffpn14x,t1_ffpif7a,1580099166.0,Guess what I’m also Australian and I have family which have had homes burnt down. What I’m saying is that we will recover. Yes many animals are endangered but they will be fine thanks animal breeding programs. Coby Bryant death is sad but and celebrities die eventually. I’m not disrespecting him but he also had many rape accusations. WW3 wasn’t just a meme; people were genuinely worried. It was a real possibility that people made memes about. I know that this is just a meme sub but the fact is there are hundreds of thousands of people that will see this and it’s a guarantee that someone will see this and start think the world is going to end. I also later said that the death from the coronavirus will be sad of course but I’m saying don’t worry if you live in a first world country as you will be perfectly fine

BikiniBottomTwitter,ffp84fb,t3_eucxki,1580088599.0,"Just shut up. WW3 was never gonna happen cause of that stupid assassination. Yeah Kobe Bryant dies but that what happens to famous people. A lot of celebrity’s died in 2018 and 2019.

The coronavirus is going to be another passing disease like Ebola. It’s gonna affect China and a few south Asian countries and then dip. Yeah a heap of people will die in those countries and that will be incredibly sad but as long as you are first world country you will be completely fine. They will find a cure eventually or a way to stop it spreading and then it will be over by the end of the year maximum. Yes there will be people in America or Australia that get infected but they will be quarantined before they can infect anyone just like what happened with Ebola.

Yes Australia is still on fire but we are approaching the end of fire season and the fires are starting to die down. The flooding really isn’t that bad and everyone will be fined.

And yes these events are sad but everyone will be fine in the end"

I am not going to try to bring you around to agree with my opinion on Kanye’s music as we all have a taste in music and I know that that taste is almost impossible to influence.

Tbf kanye is one of the best artists if not the best artist of the century in my opinion. Of course he ain’t shit compared to the Beatles and others but yeah. I mean he released the best album of the decade with MBDTF. And also released amazing albums with CD, Graduation, 808s, Some of Yeezus, TLOP, KSG, and Ye. But hey that’s just my opinion and he is my favourite artist so I’m definitely biased."
