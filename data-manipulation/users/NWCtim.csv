So if you hate switching your clocks twice a year and don't care about DST vs standard then just appeal to your state government to switch to year round standard time.  If you want to stay on DST year round then you can still appeal to your state government, but the state government then has to appeal to the US Government to change the rules and allow states the option to use year round DST."

In other sports (aka meat sports) rosters and roster negotiations are so highly publicized that it's basically impossible to keep anything a secret.  It's part of what keeps people interested outside of the regular season and generally adds to the drama.

Melee weapons will deal a bit more damage on horseback than on foot thanks to the additional benefit of the horse's STR attribute, and can still inflict status effects.  A spear will cripple with it's light attack and bleed with it's heavy when used on horseback, for example.

The real benefit is the mobility and extra tankiness being on a horse provides.  You can easily avoid most, if not all, boss attacks, and if you do get hit, your horse's stamina tanks almost all of the damage."

Basically, the US had regularly been flying solo B-29s over Japan for recon.  Japan knew these aircraft weren't an immediate threat and lacked the resources to intercept anything wasn't an immediate threat, so let them pass.

VOY also established something to the effect that the captain of the ship with tactical superiority has final authority in some situations.  While this probably doesn't strictly apply to fleet actions in war, it's important to keep in mind that Starfleet does use this line of logic, and the Defiant is arguably the most tactically superior ship of the fleet.  Combined with the fact that he has more experience dealing with and fighting Jem'hadar than most, if not all, Starfleet officers at the start of the war, it makes sense to put him in command of fleet operations."
