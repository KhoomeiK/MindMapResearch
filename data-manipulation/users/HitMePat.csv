This stops people from the natural reaction of seeing a really high score and thinking ""oh yeah, that is a good comment, I should upvote it"" (or the inverse with unpopular comments)

I see the logic in that, but when you sort the comments by Best or Hot, don't you know which comments are the most upvoted by default, because they're the ones higher up?"

If you bought the 1200$ ""at once"", you're saying you buy right away at the beginning of that 12 months?  Because DCA tends to appeal to people who dont want to or cant afford to dump a huge lump sum up front.  But they can budget putting $25/week going forward.  

Looking at bitcoins history, its obvious that getting as much $$ in as early as possible would have the better results.   So a lump sum purchase up front would beat DCA most of the time.   But that isn't in everyone's budget. 

Yeah,  if you had DCA $10/week for the last 10 years you'd have invested $5,200 and you'd have a shit ton of bitcoin, and it was achievable and not very risky.  If you put all $5,200 in a lump sum ten years ago... you'd have a shit ton more BTC than DCA would allow you to accumulate.   But it would have been a huge risk, and having $5k to throw at a risky investment isn't in everyone's budget."

How much do you accommodate the trans athletes so they can compete without discrimination versus how much you accommodate the female born athletes who also want to compete and win at the highest levels?

And the overtly ""PC"" characters in South Park like PC Principal and his PC babies who support LGBT rights from the bottom of their hearts struggle to accept that as legitimate.   In the end everyone agrees that it is ok to call out and be uncomfortable with the unfairness and inequality when it comes to sports competitions.

Trans people should be free to live their lives in peace like anyone else without being hated or discriminated against.   But MtF trans who choose to compete in competitive sports create a really tricky situation.  Where to draw the line on when a man who is transitioned/transitioning into a woman is hard to determine if you want to keep the sport fair."

If he had never done that, someone else would have shortly after.  Not saying Mark Cuban isn't a smart hard working guy...its just that there must have been tens of thousands of people just as smart and hard working as him at that time, who missed out on being a billionaire because someone beat them to it.  The reward far outweighed the effort and skill involved in achieving it.

It's the same with Zuckerberg.  And so many other billionaires.  It's 99.999% luck, because someone else would have done the exact same thing they did if Cuban or Zuck hadn't done it first.

The problem with the balance in the gif is that he is holding one length of the rope and standing in the other without keeping his balance.  So he doesnt keep his CG centered between the two legs, so his CG naturally tries to swing under the hook.  It has nothing to do with the way the rope is attached to the basket.   

I see your username and your use of engineering terms like moments and free body diagrams, so I assume you're in school learning about physics and think you have this figured out.  I'm a professional engineer and have been designing and approving rigging sketches for almost 12 years.   For some really heavy equipment and many loads with really awkward geometry.   They are all based on the principle of the CG naturally rotating to directly below the hook, and then trying to equalize the load in each leg of a pick by adjusting the lengths accordingly. 

If you were correct that the load isn't even across the two basket handles, his body would swing left or right toward the handle that had no tension.   That isn't the case in the gif.


Edit:  nice diagram but you are missing the point.  The rope isn't tied to one handle.  It is looped through both handles and tied to itself."

If the rope/sling is tied to itself and not a handle of the basket, it creates a loop that pulls the two handles toward each other and equalizes the tension throughout.  It doesn't mean the handles have to touch, they'll still have equal tension on them.  It depends how high up on the rope you've tied the knot.  

A load on a single tether (sling, rope, strap, etc) will always shift the CG to right under the hook (or pulley in this case) and the sling tension will equalize.  Unless theres some friction or pinch point that prevents the rope from sliding."
funny,ffdh96y,t1_ffdfgj0,1579820825.0,"Uhh.. using a sling through two handles in a basket like this is a common technique in rigging to lift loads that don't have pads or hoist rings or other rigging attachments. 

If it were a rigid metal bucket and the rope was looped under one and *tied to the other* instead of back to the sling itself, you'd be right.  In this case its looped through both handles and tied back to the rope itself.  This guarantees even load on both handles as long as the holes in the handles are big enough for the rope to freely slide through them without binding from friction."
