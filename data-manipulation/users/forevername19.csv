bipolar,ff4a57j,t1_ff4865n,1579558878.0,"AhahH yes i def get it. Lately, really the past 4 years ive struggled a bunch with my sexuality and i cant figure out what to do. My partner doesnt totally share my feelings but talks openly about it. Im not positive im ready to even figure it out. Am i high libido because of bipolar or is it really me? Either way i am experiencing it and im pretty sure im a lesbian or at least bi. I am feeling like i need to have time to figure it out but it means losing him. Im pretty unhappy a lot about it.  Do i sacrifice having sex  that i want, for the sake of staying with someone. Will i be sad later? Will i regret the saacrifuce. Ahhhhhh i feel ashamed of myself for these feelings. Just feeling super desperate for a change."

bipolar,ff2dj7x,t1_feyn06h,1579501764.0,Yes precisely. Its enough just to be. If u add cool. If u subtract not coool. Im subracting right now n need to gain my footing again
bipolar,ff2ddso,t1_ff26yih,1579501603.0,Thank you for sharing.  You seem matter of fact in your text but i know how difficult it is to share. It means a lot to hear you r willing to keep giving it a try. You are you n that is important.
bipolar,ff2d560,t1_ff282sh,1579501351.0,I like the idea. Youd fully get each other. But wld u drive each other mad? It sounds hectic. Agreements must be made lol
bipolar,ff2d256,t1_ff1unlr,1579501263.0,"Yes i def see your point. I am quite similar. Never married but kind of realizing im not made for that. Do you have sex even though youre single? Im worried i will have too much hypersexual sex being single. As if a relationship holds me back.  Not that i lack self control, but quite frankly i do. And i dont want to unleash in someone n just ruin things. Ah idk. This is friggin hard to understand. Love doesnt feel real."
