nba,ffruwpc,t1_ffrsvbb,1580166383.0,"Exactly why reposted this without the unfortunate unintentional but apparently perceived ""screw you and your story of thanking Kobe, for not knowing where Finland is"". I felt bad and wanted those who didn't know without Google to check where we are just to get what I mean by saying this has been felt around the world. But here we are again so I guess it was just my subconscious saying ""let's stir some shit up"". It knew the structure of the education system in the States. Where you need a ton of money in every stage of learning to get the same level of education as most of the first world gets as a basic human right. Also it had decades of hearing and seeing countless stories and videos where Americans try to guess where other countries are. ""Isn't Sweden like the capital of Europe"". The perceived middle finger wasn't my intention. I wrote the story and posted it without reading through it. My apologies."

gaming,ffmtkz8,t1_ffmjhmh,1580058717.0,"I'm not minimizing their efforts and suffering in any way. But those who have served in active combat are a very small portion of the people. There are many stages between civil war happening around you and what you have over there. For most of the people there every war has been an event far far away. Unless you have loved ones over there you don't think about it because it's not threatening. Sounds harsh I know. But it's just geographical. You guys are huge and pretty much located on an island.
I'm from Finland. Every male here is required to go to army or serve in civil sectors and go through repeat combat trainings until you're over the age limit. 18 months + the repeats for me. Russia is next to us and they are pretty batshit so we just have to be prepared. Our grandparents already went through two wars with them trying and almost succeeding in conquering us.
Just geographical shit"
