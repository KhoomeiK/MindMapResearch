equelMemes,ffjp5wn,t1_ffjivdd,1580003465.0,"Well sure, things *happen*. But it's as if Snoke didn't play a major part in it at all. He was just dead. Why didn't Kylo just start off as the Supreme leader in the first place? The story could have literally replaced him with Kylo and nothing would really be that much different."
equelMemes,ffji4p5,t1_ffjg7ha,1579998721.0,"I meant blasted with info as in the story was moving so quickly. TLJ is like, what, a couple hours or days after TFA? Hours I think, and during that time Rey becomes this unstoppable force wielding uber character.  Snoke is killed, easily and without any consequences. Leia dies then doesn't. It was all jarring as fuck."
equelMemes,ffja99h,t1_ffiztw5,1579994075.0,"I was 13,16, and 18 for the prequels respectively. TPM had me, no doubt solely because A: new star wars and B: Holy shit who is darth maul? Then TCW, pretty clear to me at the time that was shit. RoS was an absolute bombshell though that I didn't expect. Sure it had its crap dialog, but all was undone and forgiven when I got to watch 30min of Obi-Wan and Anakin brawl out.

The ST, I was 28. TFA: Man I was so excited and happy with that movie. Could not wait for the next one. But that's where the rift really divides SW fans isnt it? So many things happened within that movie. Within the first ten minutes. It was pretty much non stop from there."
equelMemes,ffj4y6o,t1_ffiwvg3,1579990510.0,I couldn't tell you chronologically what happened in both TLJ or TRS.  I was just blasted with so much information at all times it was hard to keep up with what the hell was happening.

todayilearned,ff152e8,t1_ff0s9ms,1579475282.0,"It wasn't intended to be a voting feature at all. It was too promote comments that had significance in the topic at hand. It slowly devolved into what we see today where the most popular opinion (on reddit) is often the most upvoted.  It's a shame, Reddit used to be quite different.
