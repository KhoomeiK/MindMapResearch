todayilearned,ffv1479,t1_ffv0dxn,1580253275.0,It's definitely an unconstitutional practice - but one I don't see going away anytime soon.
todayilearned,ffv0mya,t1_ffuvkas,1580252975.0,"the practice comes from the Gold Rush -

By the early 1850s, the California Gold Rush had attracted a less desirable crowd. Crooks, bandits, claim jumpers, professional gamblers and others came to take advantage of the wealth. With little federal law enforcement availability and mining camps still outnumbering towns most miners turned to mob justice and vigilantism (See Vigilante Committees).

When the Alaska Gold Rush came around in 1896 an abundance of gamblers, con men and thieves made their way north following the discovery of gold in the Klondike. And with no official lawmen to take care of evildoers, miners took the law into their own hands and dispensed frontier justice once again. Murder was punished by hanging; stealing meant a sound whipping or banishment.

After Alaska became a territory in 1912, Alaskans turned away from hanging and whipping offenders, but they kept their tradition of banishment to deal with “undesirables.” When rascals could not, or would not, find legal employment and instead led lives that included drinking alcohol to excess and crime, they were given one-way tickets back to the “Lower 48.”

Referred to as “blue ticketing,” this method of removing ne’er-do-wells from Alaska society often was used by police officers. The miscreants were given a choice of a trip to jail or a one-way ticket south. The accused usually chose the ticket and then was escorted via train to Seward to catch a steamship bound for Seattle.

The term “blue ticket” stemmed from the color of steamship passes at the time. Sometimes concerned citizens pooled their resources to purchase a ticket for a scallywag, other times businessmen donated funds. Once a person was issued a blue ticket, his or her name was put on a special list that prohibited a return to the territory by boat.

This system worked pretty well, according to sources that lived in Alaska at the time. Once in a while a blue-ticket passenger would sell the ticket in Seward. Then he’d use the money to buy alcohol and resume the conduct that got him the ticket in the first place. But overall, it proved an effective way to rid the territory of troublemakers.

The practice of blue ticketing eventually died out. And good riddance, some attorneys today would say, as the procedure did not offer the offenders due process and probably was unconstitutional."

todayilearned,ffutdyo,t3_eva00q,1580248985.0,"It's called Blue Ticketing and this used to happen all the time in Alaska. 

If someone was a problem to a community they would simply buy them a one-way ticket to Anchorage, Juneau, or Seattle and force them on the plane or ship. 

One of the most recent instances involved the village of Tanana. The Tanana Village Council, the Athabascan Indian tribal authority in the northern village of 250, took steps to expel two men who contributed to the homicides of two Alaska State Troopers in 2014.

And when a man suspected of drug dealing stepped off a plane in Sand Point last year, residents of the community surrounded him and told him he was not welcome in their village. They handed him a return ticket to Anchorage and made sure he got back on the airplane.

Those living in the Yup’ik Eskimo village of Akiak in southwest Alaska also voted in April 2013 to banish a man for bootlegging and drug dealing.

Village councils rely on the state to enforce the banishments when they are handed down, and the Alaska Department of Law appears to unofficially support the practice."

some copypasta - The United States lost comparatively few men because it did not enter the war until 1917, was slow to build a large army in France, and fought in only thirteen major battles. According to one study, the French, British and Germans lost thirty-four, sixteen, and thirty men per 1,000 respectively, compared to the American toll of one man per 1,000. The American Expeditionary Force (AEF) spent only 200 days in combat, from 25 April 1918 to the armistice.   


For the combined Army, Navy and Marine forces of 4.7 million (Army of 4.1 million and a Navy of 600,000), the U.S. Department of Defense official figures for the period from 1 April 1917 to 31 December 1918 stand at 116,516 deaths. This includes 479 soldiers and 675 members of the Navy and the Marine Corps lost at sea. The U.S. Coast Guard lost an additional 192 men. Fully two-thirds of all American deaths occurred in the last three months of the war - September, October, and November 1918 - due to the influenza pandemic of 1918 and the AEF's greatest battle, the Meuse-Argonne (26 September 1918 – 11 November 1918). The United States was also unique in that - due largely to the epidemic - almost half of the losses occurred in training camps in the homeland rather than on the battlefields of Europe. The United States consequently lost more soldiers and sailors to disease than in combat, with 53,402 battle deaths and 63,114 non-combat deaths."
