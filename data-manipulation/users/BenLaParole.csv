BritishSuccess,ffd16s5,t3_eswih1,1579811389.0,Commuted daily to London for a few years. Had a couple of encounters with BTP and they were always so polite and respectful but dropped the hammer when required. I would not fuck with them.
toptalent,ff9kqj7,t1_ff9k446,1579715063.0,"I'm gonna risk it here and say that The Kite Runner was an incredibly well written book by a fantastic author. So all he did there was not fuck up the story of an incredible book someone else had written. 

Troy is an historical story that frankly was adequately brought to life as a film saved mainly by it's cast and fight scenes. I mean the actual screenplay aside from the mythical/historical tale itself was pretty formulaic.

as for Wolverine... okay that's a good film. Maybe the other cowriter was decent...?"
todayilearned,ff8d9zz,t1_ff88ph2,1579673719.0,I mean in a lot (I would most but I haven’t checked) first world countries you don’t even pay for an ambulance. Isn’t that a concern as well?

Documentaries,ff468og,t1_ff41lb4,1579556446.0,I didn’t say it was logical... that’s just how it works. Metric is logical and we use that in the U.K. too
Documentaries,ff3zk4x,t1_ff3z1qv,1579552291.0,Lol stones is just the next unit of measurement after pounds. There’s 14 pounds in a stone. It’s the same imperial system that America inherited from Britain
PublicFreakout,ff3vw60,t1_ff3j3lx,1579549999.0,Thank fuck. The original comment was unreadable

Grimdank,femxxlv,t3_epx8x9,1579272473.0,Lucky you. I tried to make a joke over at warhammer40k about this and just got downvotes...
Warhammer40k,femw61a,t1_femqrjg,1579271194.0,It was a joke...
Warhammer40k,fem8y6x,t1_fel26ak,1579244127.0,It was just a joke
PublicFreakout,feg9v36,t1_feg3o3e,1579084045.0,"I kinda agree however think about weird it is that we have toy guns at all. I mean genuinely really think about how weird that is. 

I had one when I was little and I agree it’s a shame the world has changed to such an extent that you really shouldn’t take anything that looks like a gun out in public. However it’s also weird that he’s telling them off for having a toy gun but you can legally own a gun and take it out in public in the US. 

I don’t know what my point is. Guns are weird man. Worlds fucked up"
science,fdjje4q,t1_fdj5n5e,1578473558.0,Well that’s the difference between profit and not-for-profit organisations. The objective or the goal for the NHS for example is to improve the patients quality of life. That is the incentive - patient care

ADHD,fcdngts,t3_eh3c2u,1577611693.0,I usually read the message then think “I’ll reply properly later when I have a minute” then either never have that minute and or forget to reply. I usually wait til Sunday and check all my messages and conversations and respond to the ones I forgot to in the week
ADHD,fcdienq,t1_fcbz73e,1577610271.0,Unfortunately you can’t afford not to either.
BritishSuccess,fcdcou2,t1_fcbgzba,1577608792.0,"If you asked for my seat I would give it to you. It happened a lot when I was commuting. 

I won’t lie there were days when my back was in agony and I’d much rather sit for the 1h23min journey but if you said to me that you had a condition the seat I’d yours."
Military,fc7z7n4,t1_fc7trbs,1577522581.0,"Not sure if joking or not. But after having read u/-Rasczak ‘s above comment it got me thinking. 

I think we need to recognise that when people feel suicidal sometimes they’re entirely justified to feel that way. There are lives people have that I just couldn’t handle coz I’m not strong enough. If I was somehow thrust into their life by societal or economic upheaval or regime change, i acknowledge I might feel suicidal. 

I think my point here is that we need to recognise that society has to share blame for forcing people into the wrong professions or lives. 

On paper I have a great life but it’s hard for me to get over my one big issue - I feel I have absolutely no purpose. I work in finance and I get treated like absolute shit. I earn very little and I’ve been pigeonholed into this career now so I can’t do anything else. My job can be incredibly stressful and I sometimes take it home with me and breakdown and I just want to run away for ever. 

The one thing I would say to anyone in this sub is that if you serve in any military. Whatever the branch; you have a purpose. You have my respect for doing what I couldn’t. I hope you find the camaraderie that I can’t find in my work to help get you through the days. 

I won’t say thanks for your service or anything like that because I’m British and frankly we find that super insincere and a bit weird when we see it. So I’ll just say what I’d say to you in person - I hope you’re okay, you do an important job for the people of your country and can I buy you a pint?

Sorry for the rant I’ve just woken up and have a pretty intense flu/fever"
AskReddit,fc7xyd5,t1_fc7sjmp,1577521597.0,"Lol nope definitely sounds like Kregg and Craig to me. 

Note Graham in the U.K. is Grayum not gram as well. That always grates on me!"
