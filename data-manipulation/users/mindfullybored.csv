Soon, she stumbles upon a plot involving local dissidents, a kidnapped brigadier's wife, and some awfully familiar Scottish werewolves.

The second trilogy (Liveship Traders) is difficult for most people to get into after the first trilogy.  The first trilogy is first person, the second is third person, set in a different part of the world, and follows a much larger cast so it isn't as personal. But the third trilogy goes back to the pattern/characters in the first trilogy. If I were reading it all for the first time, I'd say read trilogies 1 & 3, then read series 4, go back and read trilogy 2, then move to the final series.

My next recommendation is completely different. It's Etiquette & Espionage by Gail Carriger.  It's steampunk fantasy, which is not a genre I read. But her writing is freaking fantastic. This series is about a girl in Victorian England who is sent to a prestigious finishing school where she is taught the fine art of assassination--""in the politest possible way, of course.""   There are vampires in this world, but they are minor characters. And her take on the supernatural is pretty hilarious.  I find these books to be very similar to Tamora Pierce."
psychologystudents,ffhjqt2,t3_etnfyz,1579938422.0,"I think you need to better define the ideas behind ""control"" and ""manage"" before this question can be answered properly.  

For example, by ""control their anger"" do you mean that they can vary the intensity of it according to their goals? (Ramp it up to intimidate, shove it down to hide it.)  Or do you mean that they can control the actions they take when feeling anger?

Imo, the skill of managing emotions comes after learning to differentiate between the emotion, our thoughts, our actions, and what choices we make regarding each of these things.  Some people learn that fastest with anger, some with sadness. But since its a skill that takes time to learn, they'll likely learn it across multiple emotions at around the same time.

> I just wish I didn't have to do it the way that I did

This is a bit of an issue.  See, you didn't have to do it the way you did.  Maybe it's just a figure of speech. But in case it's a reflection of habitual behavior/thinking for you, it's something that you may want to spend some time thinking about.

There are always other ways of dealing with your own emotions. And blaming your emotions for ""making"" you act in a way intended to hurt other people is a cop-out. 

You decided to let it all out with no purpose other than to make her feel bad and/or you feel good.  I'm not saying you should swallow the things that bother you, but there are more productive ways to do it.  What is your goal for the relationship? If you want to be included in the time your husband spends with her there has to be room for her to be hurt by your sudden attack.  It's very possible that all those things that bothered you when she lived with you are things she didn't realize were so important to you.  (Ie smoking on the porch when you're away for the weekend. You're nowhere near the property so why would that be unacceptable?)

It's also common that when people are holding in the things that are intolerable for them little things become bigger than they are.  If you were barely paying your mortgage and you're also supporting her, buying alcohol for her pleasure when it creates a budget deficit for you would be a huge problem. Of course you'd be stressed about her!  Before you decide to reach out to her, I'd recommend imagining what it would be like to have conversations with her where you can tell her what frustrates you. Not in terms of what she's done, but in terms of what it means for you.

""Our tight budget brought about feelings of insecurity for our future. I was spending nights thinking about the possibility of losing our house. I was sacrificing my own hobbies, interests, and emotional well-being in order to keep a roof over all of our heads. Being asked to purchase alcohol, a recreation beverage that doesn't increase our security or benefit me, angered me. It didn't seem fair to me that I was paying for someone elses recreation by adding to my stress.""

This helps you own your emotions.  It helps you discover what your absolute needs are and what is really going on with you.  When you make it about someone else's behavior, instead of your own reactions, you give them a lot of power over you.  But knowing what makes your own emotions bubble over or shut down gives you the power to decide if you want to be around those emotional amplifiers. If someone cares about you, they would be interested in finding ways that work for both of you to manage those amplifiers.  But you have to show the same care for their amplifiers too.  (This is as important for good amplifiers as bad ones.)"

We've worked hard to make sure our household operates in a way that works for us and that we are meeting our individual emotional & physical needs.  But it was a rough progression to this point. 

My mom and sister had an unhealthy codependent relationship for years. And I was suicidal after my ex-husband left - believing that I would be nothing but a burden to anyone I lived with.  Even though I knew my mom & sister would take me in, the thought of spending the rest of my life dealing daily with their drama was horrifying.

But I got into some amazing counseling that taught me new ways of dealing with life.  I was able to bring these new skills into my relationship with my family.  Their relationship has changed dramatically, and they say often that if it weren't for me sharing my new skills with them they wouldn't even be living together anymore.  And we're all happier than we've ever been before.  My mom said once, ""I know CFS is terrible for you, but I am so grateful you have it.""  (B/c if I didn't, I wouldn't live with them and spend my energy helping them learn emotional intelligence.)

Honestly, even though I only function at about 10% normal, my life is much more emotionally fulfilling than when I had a successful career, my own business, or marriage. 

For home support, we bring in someone to clean and cook 2x/week. We plan carefully, always making sure we have stuff (food/meds/comforts)  ready for when I'm flaring. We are very careful about making sure I get enough rest and we communicate and decide together what to spend my energy on.  But the reason this works is because we are just as deliberate with them, too.  We make sure each gets regular activities that feed their soul, check in regularly to see if anyone is feeling overwhelmed, and keep our long-term goals aligned.

I will say this... The one thing I have now, that probably would have done the most to keep me from declining so much, is an electric wheelchair.  Walking, standing upright, is extremely tiring.  It was easier on me to do 20 mins of intense weight training than to walk around for a couple hours a day.  But I resisted it much longer than I should.  It lets me go out for 4x longer with 1/4 of the recovery time.  

The worst thing I did was think I could maintain the same level of activity for a day, then just spend the time to recover.  This illness is progressive in that pushing through will make you worse.  I got worse every year for 5 years, until I learned to stop.  The last 5 years have been about learning my limits and learning to respect them.

I have seen these comparisons and have actually written about hoping some Bernie supporters are Russian trolls.

And, no other candidate on the left has the same level of fanaticism in their supporters as Bernie does. Which Trump also has. Except maybe Yang.  He's got a surprising level of devotion for coming to the game so late. Devoted supporters aren't a problem unless the *majority* of supporters are wildly devoted (like Trump).

With Trump's fanatic base and the unconscious sexism of the media and voters, deciding a woman democratic party nominee can't win isn't an evaluation of a woman's ability to be president. It would be an evaluation of the state of the playing board and the sexism of the rest of the players.

I definitely think anyone who is outright sexist would be uncomfortable with Bernie's overall paradigm.  What I suspect is happening is that unconscious sexism - subliminal expectation - is showing up.  Like the way I expected my ex-husband to take out the garbage because it was my brothers job growing up. 

In my conservative religious upbringing harming a man's pride was looked down on, while women's pride was never a consideration. In disagreements women were expected to be the peacekeepers, to find a resolution while respecting his indignation if his pride had been pricked.

In this instance, both their prides have been pricked. You're correct that Warren has done little damage control for Bernie.  But Bernie also immediately blamed Warren's campaign and said they were lying about him, when it wasn't her campaign that brought this to press attention.

> I would think that they would talk about this in private away from the cameras instead of airing on stage. 

That's what I hoped before the debate. I was looking forward to seeing them coordinate replies to the inevitable questions. I wanted to see how they could stymie the press and turn their manufactured shit show into a non-issue. When Bernie declared, ""I never said that,"" and then comments from Bernie supporters blamed Warren for not shutting the press down, it felt to me like the unconscious sexism of my childhood. That Bernie had the right to defend his pride and Warren had the responsibility to find a resolution.

If it was a miscommunication as I assume, Bernie said something that could be interpreted two ways and he intended it to be taken one way while she heard it another, in my mind they bear equal responsibility for finding a resolution and have equal rights to defend their pride.

There is a chance that it was completely different. Sanders talked about the vitriol a woman would face and Warren exaggerated that into meaning a woman can't win against Trump. In which case she would be guilty of putting words in his mouth and denigrating him to the press in 2018.

Or, he could have said exactly what she's claiming. That, in spite of his past belief and efforts on behalf of female candidates, he thinks this election cycle will be too difficult for a female contender to win. (Which wouldn't be an absurd conclusion with the strong support Trump gets from his followers and our history of unconscious sexism in politics.)  In which case he would be guilty of denying his words and framing Warren as a liar.

No. I think they probably had a much more involved conversation about the difficulties a woman would face going against Trump.  At some point in the conversation he may have said something along the lines of, ""I don't know how a woman can go against Trump while also walking the fine line of sexist landmines in our political climate.""  Maybe he intended the subtext to be ""I have no good strategy suggestions,"" while she heard the subtext of, ""there's no way through the landmine field.""  

Conversation is tricky and people usual remember the subtext they meant or heard instead of the actual words said.  I doubt anyone who says, ""I never said that,"" because it's impossible to prove and memory is so fallible.

Any good communicator, negotiator, or conflict resolver knows that once you take such an absolute stand you are forcing the other person onto the defensive. 

>It was just the worst possible handling of it by the Warren camp.

Respectfully, I disagree with your assessment.  Shortly after the conversation in 2018, Warren told some reporters something like, ""Bernie said a woman can't win against Trump. I disagreed.""  Nobody made a big deal about it then and she continued to consider him an ally.

When the story came out on CNN recently, it was dug up from those reporters and even they couldn't agree on exactly what Warren told them.  But Bernie's response was to accuse Warren's campaign of lying about him.  He immediately assumed she had attacked him and countered with an attack of his own.  

When I heard the story before the debate, I hoped their camps would get together and decide on a way to downplay it all in coordination with each other.  Obviously this didn't happen.  

I suspect Sanders saw this as an opportunity to bring out his history of supporting women in politics. He's definitely done that in the past and should be proud of it.  But in this instance, it seems like he threw her and her team under the bus.

If my scenario is correct and they are both equally wrong about what was said, they each misunderstood what Sanders said/meant and Warren heard, then they share equal blame for this drama.

Are you saying that Warren should have rejected that Sanders said ""a woman can't win against Trump in 2020""? 

Or that she should have clarified that he didn't say a woman couldn't be president, just that a woman couldn't be president in 2020?

Or are you saying that there is no way Sanders ever said anything that could possibly be construed as a woman can't win this election against Trump?

Because these are 3 very different scenarios. One would mean she'd lied to a room full of reporters 2 years ago about a person she fully viewed and treated as an ally.  The second would be making a new statement about a friend's beliefs that could potentially harm both of them. And the third is a pretty big blank check on a lifetime of speech.  

Frankly, knowing how often people say things in private conversations that don't come out exactly as they mean, or that aren't heard exactly as they were said, the third scenario seems the most unlikely to me, and the riskiest to place your bets on.  

But if you've decided that Warren is a habitual liar and that Bernie is incapable of misspeaking or misremembering, then your conclusions about this issue are forgone.

>when the mics were on, she screamed that Bernie was a liar,

Huh. You call that screaming? And she didn't say Bernie was a liar. She said, quite calmly and only speaking up when he didn't hear her the first time, ""I think you just called me a liar on national TV.""  

>Warren also doubled down on it at the debates.

The moderator didn't ask *if* Sanders said it. She asked Warren what she thought when Sanders said ""a woman can't win against Trump"" and she replied, ""I disagreed. I'm not here to fight Bernie."" Then she went to talk about keeping unity in the Democratic party and how successful the current female candidates have been in elections. She didn't double down on anything.

This is what I don't understand.  How would explaining that he said a woman can't win against Trump in 2020 make him look bad?  Women's reputations usually come out worse whenever there's drama between a man and woman in politics. Women have a very fine line to walk between standing up for themselves and looking angry and bitter.  With the way Trump campaigns it is a legitimate concern.  Women have to be much more constrained than men on the debate stage and Trump runs those like a circus.  How would acknowledging these very real sexist issues in politics make him look bad?"

But, ""a woman can't beat Trump in 2020"" sounds like ""a woman can't become president in 2020"" which includes the phrase ""a woman can't become president."" 

""In 2020"" is the qualifier.  So, yes, the media is misrepresenting what she reported. But it isn't a straight up lie.  If he said it to her, him saying ""I didn't say that"" also isn't a straight up lie. But it's as misrepresentative of Warren's statement as what the media is reporting."

The latter is a judgement about women's competency, the other about the country's beliefs.  That's why I'm so shocked about his strong denial. Saying a woman would have a hard time against Trump isn't absurd. It's logical.

>It's possible that he did a quick mental calculation and decided that his least worst option was an unequivocal denial.

This is actually what worries me.  Between his campaigns instructions to ""other"" Warren supporters, two former governors of his state coming out against him on this particular issue (though not others), and the fact that historically drama between men and women in politics almost always ends up being worse for the women, I think it's possible he decided his stance was a better bet for his chances at nomination, even if it risks the progressive movement as a whole. And, even if it puts Warren in a bad place.

From my perspective, Sanders fed it gasoline when he pronounced ""I did not say that.""

And, if what he meant was that a female would face terrible fire in this race, but Warren heard it differently - as more of an absolute, then his unequivocal denial seems overblown.

I guess from my perspective he bears more responsibility for feeding the fire, but she's the one being expected to put out the flames.  It's almost funny in the way it's working out - like a parody of cliche male/female conflict resolution - male dealing in absolutes, female avoiding talking about it, and female expected to suck it up and apologize first to fix the relationship.
