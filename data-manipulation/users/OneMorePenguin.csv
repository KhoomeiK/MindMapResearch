cats,ff5dfa0,t3_ernmx4,1579588252.0,Thank you for sharing Fred's story.  I consider every day after 15 to be a cherished gift.  Fred had a huge impact on his people's lives.  He was a very special kitty.
cats,ff45gi0,t1_ff2lhh7,1579555958.0,"After several experiences with older, sick cats, my opinion is that sooner is probably better than waiting.  Cats hide pain so well, I suspect many are uncomfortable in their last days.  

Thank you for sharing the photos.  Honoring Sissi with friends was a great way to celebrate  the life you shared."
cat,ff2htji,t3_er88rr,1579506755.0,I see that Catticus was only with you for six months.  Thank you for giving him love and a home.
cats,ff2hn19,t3_eqyh8r,1579506528.0,Hmmmm.  I guess you must have discarded the box it came in or they cats would be all over the box instead :-)  It looks comfy.
cats,ff2hk4v,t3_er3s9y,1579506428.0,I am sure Sissi would thank you for giving her so many wonderful years.  What a beautiful kitty Sissi is.
TripodCats,ff2hg72,t3_er1j41,1579506295.0,"What a cutie pie Meeko is!  How old is he and what happened to his arm that is required amputation?  Animals, unlike humans, do not complain.  They take whatever life throws at them and they deal with it the best they can."
seniorkitties,ff2hbm3,t3_er0v7w,1579506133.0,Wow!  This is awesome news!  Thank you for taking such good care of her and doing the hard work of rehab.  She's adorable.
cats,ff2h818,t3_er7fi9,1579506012.0,I'm so sorry for the loss of this pretty and talented kitty.   He had a good life and you provided him with the best five years of retirement any kitty could wish for.

cat,fe6k6ge,t3_enuq0s,1578893575.0,"She's adorable!  Keep a close eye on food intake, weight and litter box habits.  These are often the first signs that humans notice health issues.  r/seniorkitties!"
seniorkitties,fe6k2cu,t3_enpzcj,1578893464.0,I hope you boy has a speedy recovery from the surgery and enjoys good health!
seniorkitties,fe6k0oo,t1_fe3yflh,1578893418.0,"I'm so sorry :-(  I lost my older cat on xmas.  While her health was declining, the seizures were unexpected, but, due to the poor prognosis for recovery, I decided to let her go now."

IndoorGarden,fe07ha9,t1_fe06ieq,1578805092.0,"That's where I get my plants, too!, including a pilea.  TJs plants are usually inexpensive compared to nurseries.  The Lowes recently ncreased the size of their  house plant section and I've scored some nice plants at good prices."
cats,fe076po,t3_encu6j,1578804851.0,He looks like he's still afraid and trying to hide.  I hope he adjusts soon.  He's adorable!
cats,fe07103,t3_engxac,1578804722.0,"He \*is\* a handsome boy!  With old cats, I find it best to keep a very close eye on their weight, food take and litter box habits.  Those are where there are signs the humans can notice when there is some impending health issue.  He is definitely a r/seniorkitties!  May he have continued good health in 2020 and beyond."
TripodCats,fe06p1g,t1_fdx6gv9,1578804451.0,I'm curious why they didn't take the whole leg.  The remaining leg isn't of any use.  Most of the tripods I see here have had the complete limb removed.
cats,fdwp7f0,t3_en69wh,1578761014.0,"You boy is no longer in pain.  You did you best for him.  You loved him and made him part of your family.  There will never be another kitty like him, but he will live forever in your heart and in your memories.

It's OK to be very sad and to grieve.  I always have had multiple cats and have experienced loss.  I prefer to not be by myself afterward, but don't necessarily want to interact with people.  Something to distract me from my grief.  When Charlie died, I went for a sunset walk out at the bay and spent the hour remembering our time together.  Went through quite a few tissues.

Find some close friends/family who want to hear some kitty stories and share them.  Post some photos and memorable stories on reddit or other social media.

For the first week or so, I frequently had to go find a place to be by myself to be sad and be weepy.  Focusing at work could be challenging.

Eventually, I hope you find room in your heart to go to the shelter and save the life of another kitty.

My condolences on the loss of your sweet boy.  He was a handsome kitty."
TripodCats,fdwlzz8,t3_en6zou,1578760069.0,He looks like a sleepy head!  So he has a stump?  I've seen some posts where stumps have had to be removed because the cat uses the stump and it gets an open sore and can get infected.  Perhaps that is for front legs.  S/He is a real cutie!
traderjoes,fdwl6fi,t3_en7nog,1578759842.0,"I have always bagged my own groceries.  If there is a dedicated bagger, they will go to another line without a bagger and bag there.  Or take a short break if it's just a couple or three items.  No one has ever chided me for bagging and something I get a thank you for helping."
TripodCats,fdwkgnx,t3_en80qc,1578759651.0,He probably doesn't live too far away!  That white diamond on his snout reminds me of my Charlie.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/aiNlR3g](https://imgur.com/gallery/aiNlR3g)

seniorkitties,fduqsgk,t3_en4aos,1578737535.0,May 2020 be a year of health and happiness for both you and your girl!  The old ones require that you keep a close eye on them to notice any impending health issues.

aww,fduq10o,t1_fdsni3b,1578737108.0,I think I would look like the cat of the left side if I had to live in that kind of environment.  I hope you are both doing better in your new environment!
cats,fduptcn,t3_emr5ht,1578736978.0,"I had two cats that I had to tranq to (1) get them calm enough for me to get them into their carrier to take to the vet and (2) get them calm enough that the vet could handle them.  As they aged, they got calmer and no longer needed to be tranqed."

IndoorGarden,fduovl7,t3_emx2kt,1578736494.0,I would have more plants if I had a cat proof plant stand.  The top of my fridge is full.  The plants can live on the outside of my kitchen window once spring arrives.

Being there with her in her final moments shows how much you truly loved her.  My condolences on the loss of Minnie.  Thank you for sharing.  I've ben watching this video over and over, mesmerized by her adeptness at tracking and catching the toy and her beautiful coat that looks oh so soft.  You were fortunate to have found each other."

He had a growth in his ear and surgery to remove the ear canal and middle ear.  Benign, and full recovery except for some head tilt.  Once you're in for $2500 for the initial CT scan....  I recommend to start saving $ now in a kitty fund should the need arise in the future.  Cats truly are amazing creatures."
Catloaf,fdtr1sg,t3_emwpbf,1578720870.0,"I know how difficult this is to go through.  Olly has had 19 years, hopefully all of them wonderful years.  He's had a good life and will live on in your hearts and in your memories.  He's a beautiful loaf."
Cinderblock,fdtqgxt,t1_fdr4mb3,1578720611.0,"I've had new kitties that spend the day under the bed and come out at night to explore and play.  I suspect your new kitty will adjust and become more friendly.  Be persistent and offer her some play time, but don't force her.  Be patient.  I find that cats like being talked to in soothing voices, even though they don't seem to respond in any way."

There's a major facial nerve that runs along the ear canal and that gets moved during the surgery.  Fortunately, there was no permanent nerve damage!  I hope Max is continuing to do well.  Eating and litter box are important.  Next is making sure there is no infection."
aww,fdpt2j4,t3_emkl3d,1578639379.0,"Awwww, he knows you are the one for him!  He's pretty.  At 19 pounds, he probably could use a bit of diet management.  He'll have more energy and not at risk for health issues and physical injury from extra weight.  May your journey through life together bring you both much joy."

cats,fdpsluz,t3_ema20o,1578638879.0,"I'm glad to hear Max is doing well!  My Domino had to have his ear removed last year and it was terrible waiting.  When he came home, he tore through the house.  The next day, he lost all his energy.  I think the anesthetics do weird things.  Be prepared to see him being more sedate tomorrow.  He's a handsome boy!  Sending healing thoughts to Max and peace and calming energy to you."
cats,fdpscws,t3_em9s6d,1578638611.0,"I recommend ear plugs.  It took me a while to not get anxious when the cats all meowed on the trip to the vet.  Surprisingly, the rides home were always quiet.  My new vet is 2 miles away and I so much happier."

Catloaf,fdde7ci,t3_eknspx,1578308140.0,"I've learned the hard way that often by the time humans notice irregular behavior with their cat, they could have been having that medical issue for days.  Kitty can't tell you when peeing is burning or has pain.  I prefer to err on the side of seeking medical attention as soon as possible rather than waiting.  Especially so when Dr. Google indicates the symptoms could be life threatening.  If you think your kitty is ""very sick"" you should not wait until tomorrow.  How close is the nearest emergency vet?

I hope it's just a simple UTI and he gets better soon."

After a vet visit and shaming from the vet and one cat gaining three ounce in four months, I came home and picked up the food bowls.  Free feeding turned into two fixed sized meals per day.  At this year's annual checkup almost 3 years later, one cat is 11 lbs, the other 12.5.  They are SO MUCH MORE ACTIVE!  Still 0.5 pounds to go on the larger one.
