MakeMeSuffer,ffietqs,t1_ffi8dlg,1579972171.0,"1. Staying in your own genepool is unhealthy.
2. Finding partners with people that you (probably) grew up with is sickly for your mental health. 
3. If you don’t set out to form bonds with new and different people, that’s not healthy for your mind either.
4. There’s usually an unhealthy or toxic relationship with age difference, grooming or straight up pedophile which is unhealthy too.
5. Feeling the need to have a sexual and intimate relationship with someone in your close family often is a sign of an underlying mental illness, which is why you shouldn’t give in to it.

I don’t mind personally if you’re like really distant cousins tho because it mainly doesn’t have anything to do with these points if you meet someone that turns out to be distant family."
