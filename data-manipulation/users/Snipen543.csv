You clearly didn't read it because 3 out of the 5 clearly state that the bear died, 1 says a person was critical because they thought the shooting was ""out of proportion"", which would imply it also died. So if the bear dying is a ""technicality"", I guess you're right; 9mm only wins against bears because the bear died instead of eating the person"

Because it's the cheapest round you can buy for target practice. The only thing it'll pierce better than is a hollow point, but those are designed to fragment and not go through a tatget.
