1. The Jamaica home already had been sold and wasn't in the estate at probate.
2. Each practicing Protestant minister in Toronto, and every [Orange Lodge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Lodge) in Toronto, had to receive a share of O'Keefe Brewery stock, a Catholic business, if they participated in its management and drew on its dividends:  the 99 ministers and the 103 Orange Lodges who accepted the bequest, did  so upon the sale of O'Keefe in 1928 for $1.35 million, in an agreement  with the executors. Coindicentally, Millar's death ocurred at the same time than the disappearance of several books of accounting of this brewery. 
3. In October 1928, five pastors in Windsor claimed the bequest of the Kenilworth shares. The value of the shares was hard to judge, as the stock did not trade  publicly. One estimation was that they were worth less than one cent  each. The racetrack would close within a decade.
4. Two anti-horse-racing advocates (Hon. William Raney, Reverend Samuel Chown) and a man who detested the Ontario Jockey Club (Abe Orpen)  were to receive a share of Ontario Jockey Club stock, provided they are  shareholders in three years. Raney's and Chown's share were eventually  given to charity and Orpen accepted his share.
