CPTSD,ffgdnjh,t1_fffp348,1579903911.0,"Yeah, I have found it has brought back memories as well. I started through Journaling and meditation but in the past week Ive put it into a word document. Im also typing up a document with the symptoms of C PTSD (emotional flashbacks, dissociation, hypervigilance, hyperarousal) and how they have all affected me. It's been devastating for me but again really helped to put all the pieces together. 

ETA: Im sorry you've gone through this, too. I wish you the best in your healing."
CPTSD,ffg8yqh,t1_fffwrc8,1579901028.0,I've also written down the ways it's affected me. It's been devastating for me in so many aspects. Good luck and I wish you the best with your healing.
CPTSD,ffes2im,t3_et83mx,1579862792.0,"Im in the process of writing down all my childhood trauma. I wrote down all the incidences of abuse and neglect, verbatim quotes of hostility from my parents over the years. I've found it really validating and it's put all the pieces together for me. It's especially helpful when I've shown my psychologist and he has pointed further pointed things out to me. C-PTSD is death by a thousand cuts."
CPTSD,ffern4v,t3_et8mm1,1579862158.0,Invalidation is never good. Maybe you need an other therapist?
