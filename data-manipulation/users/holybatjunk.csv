I gotta see these. Maybe make some. Maybe make a bunch of teensy tiny Rothko-ish paintings to put around my houseplants."
witchcraft,ffe5yj8,t1_ffdli20,1579837579.0,"What is it you want to know? Like, in a greater sense, what are you seeking? What line of thinking brought you to this question? I respect that you seem like you're looking for something besides a binary question with an easy answer. But like...I guess I just don't understand where you're going with it, haha.

Anyway, cheers dude. There's a lot to think about."

witchcraft,ffdeqom,t1_ffcbusl,1579819329.0,"I appreciate that you acknowledge that the question might be offensive, and the attempt to not be offensive, but the question is still so binary that it's baffling to me. You essentially rolled in here being like ""yooo so do y'all oppose the one true god or what, sinners.""

Like...witchcraft aside...there's so many religions in the world? With their own magical practices and their own prayer? Maybe I'm underestimating the average Christian religious upbringing here, but there's got to be a greater frame of reference than Christ or Anti Christ. Or is the assumption that somehow every culture has Satan or whatever? Because they definitely do not. So my confusion about your question isn't so much about witchcraft, I guess, but about how...culturally restrained it is. I'm really not trying to be a jerk here, but I feel like we're using different operational definitions of ""witches,"" at least.

There is no central dogma for witches. Is that your question? Witchcraft occurs across cultures and time periods and an tremendous amount of mutually exclusive practices can be called witchcraft. There are Christian witches, Catholic witches, Wiccans, reconstructionist druids, Santera witches, vodunists, etc etc etc, and practically none of those people are giving Satan or the Anti-Christ much thought, if any. It's irrelevant. Less so for the magical traditions with Catholic overlap, but still."
witchcraft,ffcbzrp,t3_eslyuw,1579796169.0,"I second or third or fourth the cord cutting ritual, with this addition: sometimes it's not a cord but a *net*. Someone said that to me once as she recommended multiple cord cutting rituals per the same situation, and it seems so basic but it totally changed my perspective. Do it and do it and do it again and you *will* cut your way out. Just keep going.

Good luck, OP."
witchcraft,ffcbqc0,t3_esug4y,1579796006.0,"Absolutely not and not to be a dick about it but this either/other paradigm of god/satan is not universal or culturally relevant. The Bible isn't the only magical book around, *nor is it the oldest*.

My practice is intensely, inherently divine. More of that I do is categorized under worship rather than witchcraft. It's also not at all Christian, because historically, culturally, it's just--it's not the only system out there and never has been. The basis of this question is just so profoundly biased that it baffles me."

realwitchcraft,ff8ds6f,t3_es5wvv,1579674281.0,"Oh hey, OP, are you me?

You're probably better off going specific rather than general. Your best bet is history books, but the more recent ones, written with a greater understanding of prior data, and clearing up previous misconceptions.

What do you actually want to find? A particular culture? A specific magical sub-practice? The question as you phrase it is hugely, wildly broad."
dogswithjobs,felhw06,t1_fej4y82,1579222558.0,"Dogs are very social and smart animals, though, and they operate within very fluid and dynamic relationship structures. So, like--the guardian dogs recognize the herding dogs as part of the pack, and mostly they don't fight it out. On some farms the dogs also work in different shifts, with the herding dogs doing their thing during their day and the LGDs working at night, when there's more likely to be wolf or coyote trouble.

But you're right that a lot of the collie body language and herding is very similar to how a wolf would hunt a sheep! And that's why it works."
dogswithjobs,felhizr,t1_feirj0q,1579222311.0,"I'm sure every now and then it happens, but usually not. Dogs are very socially cued and intelligent animals and capable of a lot of in group vs out group distinctions. It's how like a guard dog will react to a stranger but not to their owner coming home.

There's exceptions and accidents and sometimes a herding dog will kill a sheep and a LGD will be overzealous, but most of the time most dogs are mostly good at the jobs they've been bred for.

Some dogs, like mine, are not well suited their work and get kicked off the farm and end up in a shelter, but every LGD I've ever met has been really chill and that seems to mostly be the case. They're not dogs meant to hunt down and kill coyotes or anything and most of the time they're just barking at strange canids/humans and have pretty laid back personalities. Herding dogs, on the other hand, are often pretty intense. There's also a ton of training that goes into a high level herding dog, so it's not uncommon for the herding dogs to come inside at night and sleep in the house with the humans, while the LGDs are more often outside dogs."
dogswithjobs,fei4pc8,t1_fehxwcc,1579130224.0,"My understanding is that having both livestock guardian dogs and a herding dog or two is the norm, but LGDs are different breeds. Like even if they're mutts, they're not herding line mutts. Your herding breeds also have lighter, faster builds, while LGDs tend to be bigger/stronger breeds.

So it is kind of good cop/bad cop, except to the sheep it's probably like...good cop and Small Wolves that nip at that but are allowed, and Big Wolves that the cop dogs keep away."
science,fdczle5,t1_fdcvk85,1578289103.0,"Yes. D cups, slim waist, big hips, currently early 30's, navigated office politics and dress code in my 20s. It almost doesn't matter what I wear, because someone, and by someone I mostly mean some women, will think I'm dressed like a hussy regardless. If you're busty and slim waisted, you will be constantly sexualized even if your neckline is very high. Even if your blouse is relatively loose. If your tops are too loose, then big breasts make you look ""sloppy"" and that's just another flavor of hussy. Boobs make people mad, man.

I mean, I do *also* sometimes dress like a hussy now that I know it doesn't matter so why not have fun, but that really came later."
psychology,fd7chl2,t3_ejwcgv,1578202351.0,"In *practice*, an experienced therapist can absolutely spot and diagnose this. What they officially write down varies, but a clinician with ED experience knows what this looks like.

I'm not sure it's worth a separate DSM entry, though. I think it would end up being one of those things with such a huge co-morbidity rate that it would get folded in as a subtype later anyway. Every orthorexic (in therapy) I've ever met, myself included, has a restrictive subtype eating disorder diagnosis at some other point in their lives.

I'm not convinced that it isn't partially (or mostly) a subconscious way to make your eating disorder more socially acceptable/easier to manage. People leave you alone if you explain away your dietary restrictions in a way they understand/accept, and 'oh, health food' is an easy way to accomplish that."

productivity,fd731mm,t3_ejwhgx,1578198809.0,"On January 1, on vacation, on my birthday, I made sure to still get a workout in for the sheer satisfaction of knowing I could and I did. And it really reminded me that *keeping* yourself in shape is way easier and less stressful than *getting in shape*, which is a principle that applies to a lot of things. Someone else in this thread calls it a foundation of good habits and I think that's key. More modest goals, kept consistently, will do so much more for you ambitions than pressuring yourself into too much and therefore failing and restarting all the time."
todayilearned,fcz0b1v,t1_fcyuxzi,1578091055.0,"...that *depends*. Overall most dogs are pets and fundamentally not useful in a violent confrontation, and this is good. Pets are pets. I wish people didn't expect otherwise so often.

But some dogs are NOT pets and have deeply bred protective instincts, and sometimes also the appropriate training, to fuck some shit up. Some dogs naturally don't accept food from strangers and some are trained not to. Different definitions of what it means to be a good boye.

Still highly variable, ofc. My dog does attack intruders if I'm in the house, but if I'm not there he's blatantly off duty and doesn't even get up from his bed. Clearly his job is to protect his human, and only his human, and the flat screen TV can get fucked, who cares?"
realwitchcraft,fca6iw8,t3_ee6hp3,1577563783.0,"Man, do NOT go around dumping a grody rusty maybe murder weapon in running water. That's just rude and environmentally unsound.

It's probably not blood. Just toss it. If you really think it IS blood, that still doesn't mean murder weapon. If you genuinely think it's a murder weapon, then the question of what to do isn't magical."

realwitchcraft,fc9gj0l,t3_egqezp,1577552349.0,"There's always a friend or three who could use the help, yeah? Sometimes another magic user doing something specific in need of a boost, or sometimes just someone going through some shit. If I'm feeling very magically hyped I'll occasionally offer divination or spellwork for free to the first person who gets my interest. I think of it like paying it forward, in a way, but also it helps me to be consistent in my practice. Plus I like the idea of just being the village witch sometimes, dealing with random stuff. Keeps you grounded in the practical applications of magic.

It also depends on if you see yourself in a strictly magician type role or a more priestly one. I offer thanks to my deities and my ancestors on the regular. They could always go for more of that. And I try to give energy and protection back to the land I live on."
