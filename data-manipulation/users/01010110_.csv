Edit: My point is; them saying they can't, probably means can't be bothered."

oakland,fehwliw,t3_ep90ws,1579125310.0,Just a reminder that dash cams are cheap and can save you this trouble in the future. I have front and rear facing ones and it cost me less than $100 all together.

Unless it's blocking a driveway. The parking authorities can't do anything about towing - that's up to the police. And they don't have the resources.

EDIT: If a window is busted in it, or the doors open, I'd put it in neutral and get some neighbors together to move it so that it does in fact block a driveway. That way you can call the police non-emergency number and they'll come through same day to move it."
