TheMonkeysPaw,ffk1pzz,t1_ffk0gwu,1580013126.0,"Yeah, in that case you just have to do your best, for example, I did a scenario where he broke into area 51 and accidentally released a virus that gave everyone skitzofrenia, and kills some people, making it so that he thinks that everyone is hurting him, and a skitzofrenic hallucination of Darth Vader is ""protecting him"" by infecting everyone he comes in contact with and killing them. It really just all comes down to creativity spawned from limitations."
TheMonkeysPaw,ffk1ikd,t3_eu1n75,1580012948.0,"Granted. You recently moved to a new neighborhood. The people are friendly, the taxes low, the wages high. You meet some new people, super nice, they all already know each other, and are happy to welcome you to the community. Although something strange, there are no black people, I mean, everywhere you've been to before, there's been at least one black person in town, but whatever, you can brush it off. Eventually your new friends start to exhibit behavior that makes you slightly uncomfortable, the occasional racist comment, jokes about LGBTQ+ people, sometimes yelling at their wives, but they're fine, right? Surely they're not that racist. One day, your friend Jack suggests something strange, that you put on blackface and perform racist acts. Of course you deny it, and start to question this town, and wonder if this was all a mistake, but he keeps insisting. Eventually, something happens. You wake up in the middle of the night, tied up, and being carried by some people in white robes. You touch your face, and see charcoal on your hands. You hear the voices of your ""friends"", and you feel stones hitting your body, as people scream racial slurs at you, and call you a traitor. They place you on a platform with a large cross in the center. Where are you, is this in the woods? You've never seen this place before. Everyone around you has white robes on, and they say some things, then hoist you onto the cross, and light it ablaze. You start to sweat, as the fire climbs the wooden cross you are tied to. Congratulations, the kkk has forcefully put blackface on you and is executing you by burning you on a cross. You are technically the blackest man alive now, as your skin lights on fire and turns to black ash. This is why you look at the history of towns you move into."
TheMonkeysPaw,ffk072x,t3_etvdd2,1580011821.0,"Granted. You can't find a job because of your ""Intellect"", and so you join the military. Its initially pretty good, no hard thinking, lots of fun training, free food and bedding. You make some friends, and you don't regret anything. But unnoticed by you, your best friend is suffering severely from recently finding out about his wife cheating on him, and pressure is increasing on him. One day you are deployed for a mission, something simple, just invade a small base and capture a target, but something's off about your best friend. You guys end up having to kill the target, as a result of him pulling out a c4 detonator that would blow up the entire building. Your friend starts to have a panic attack, and started blankly at the mangled corpse of the capture target, as he says quietly to himself, ""I cant take this, please! Stop, ju- just stop it, NOW!!!"". You try to calm him down, as he starts to count, ""one, two, three, four"" you see he's holding something, ""five, six, seven"" your friends start to gather round to see what's happening, ""eight, nine"" you see him reveal a bomb in his hand, you yell at everyone to get down, ""ten"" the bomb explodes, and reality seems to collapse, as you experience unimaginable pain, and all of a sudden, you wake up in a hospital bed, both legs and one arm missing. Your friends are all dead, you're the last survivor. You open your mouth to speak, all you can say is ""one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten""."

They downvote every one of your comments/posts, they make fun of you, send you sexual messages, death threats ect. You eventually decide to quit reddit, and delete your account. You now suffer from extreme anxiety, and only join reddit 7 years later when your friend convinces you to at your birthday party. Congratulations, your birthday is now also your cake day, at the expense of getting permanent damage to your mental health."

TheMonkeysPaw,ffjy79j,t3_etxsz2,1580010217.0,"Granted, Facebook buys reddit, but everything seems fine for now. One day, you see an update note: ""*We are removing reddit coins! Now you can use your karma to give others rewards. As a result of this change, we will also be changing the karma system too.*"" now you earn 1 karma per 100 upvotes, and -1 karma per 1 downvote, and there is a 2 week ban on commenting if you earn too many upvotes in 1 day to ""prevent karma bots"". You can also now buy karma for the same price of reddit coins. Now people can comment mean things without repercussions as long as they have money, and ""freeloaders"" as called by Facebook (theres now a symbol by a profile to indicate they havent used microtransactions), and 1 bad comment can completely destroy how reddit persieves a person, and the ones with money can get the highest karma. Nobody knows who's good or bad now, and reddit sucks. Also congrats reddit now steals your internet history, facial recognition, location, and credit info too."

TheMonkeysPaw,ffjwvlc,t3_etxthn,1580009166.0,"Granted, youtube decides to implement a new comment system, and the reception is originally pretty good, until someone goes into the code, and finds out that they literally just stole the code from the reddit comment system. There is now a massive lawsuit case going on, and thousands of businesses pull their ads and stop sponsorships on youtube. Some creators try to promote their channels on twitch, but most don't end up making it. In the end, youtube lost way over half of it's creators, and by the time the controversy cleared up, youtube is beyond disrepair. Google sells youtube to some careless business that drives youtube further into the ground, and the creators that you once loved are now working several minimum wage jobs to even live, and most end up committing suicide. But hey, better comment system."
TheMonkeysPaw,ffjw9g3,t3_etvmw4,1580008672.0,"Granted, your best friend just got a new hat, pretty cool, ""hey that's a cool hat"" you say, ""thanks"" says your friend, looking back at you. Unfortunately, he accidentally walked into a busy street because he was too distracted by your compliment, and he gets hit by a car and dies. At his funeral, his parents tell you how he always thought of you as a sibling, being an only child, he probably would've wanted to have his cool hat. Congratulations! You have acquired cool hat!"
TheMonkeysPaw,ffjvwm9,t1_ffjuyuh,1580008399.0,"Yeah lol, I also tried on this one, I have to admit, with large wishes like these, it's hard to come up with realistic scenarios, although I think I did fairly good with my late stage capitalism scenario"
TheMonkeysPaw,ffjvoii,t3_etwv9d,1580008228.0,"Granted, you set out to become a rich capitalist, and try your hand at investments and businesses. You become fairly rich, but that's not enough, you still cant rule the world. To achieve your dream, you realize that you have to do things that you originally hated, tax evasion, worker wage decreases, buying mass quantities of companies to put into corporations, strangling out small businesses, and you soon realize why the richest people are the ones that have the most wretched personalities, and minds, but not you, you still have some good left in you. Eventually you own most business on earth, and you take rulership of the world by force. Now to fix the earth. Now to fix the earth that you starved, polluted, strangled, to gain your empire. Now to help the people that hate you with a burning passion, because you underpaid them, didnt provide insurance, burned down their dream job of owning a small business, all because you wanted that wealth for yourself. Now to conserve the wildlife that has already gone extinct as a result of your urbanization and pollution, all in the name of profit and power. Did you end up ruling the earth, achieving your dream? Yes. It is a miracle, but all miracles require a sacrifice, for their hopes, dreams, and ambitions, yours."
TheMonkeysPaw,ffjuupl,t1_ffjtnje,1580007582.0,"Finally, a real monkeys paw, although the wish did state at least 7 billion people, still, I commend you for doing a real monkey's paw"
TheMonkeysPaw,ffjunlr,t1_ffjntdc,1580007422.0,"The point of monkeys paw is that it's nothing supernatural, everything could possibly be a result of coincidence, just really dark conscience. For example, in the book, the son wishes that his family would have enough money to pay off their debt, and it happens, but the way it happens is that the son dies at work from an accident, and as a reimbursement, the company he works for gave his family the amount of money they needed to pay off their debts. With a real monkey's paw, everything needs to be believable, and the consequences always happen to fulfill the wish, not as a result of the wish being fulfilled."
TheMonkeysPaw,ffjt66x,t3_etx7mr,1580006263.0,"Granted, you end up turning to a life of crime because of circumstance, and one day you end up trying to raid area 51. In there, you find out that the US has been experimenting with a neurotoxic virus, and containing it to run tests. You, unaware of what this is, end up accidentally breaking it, and it infects you. From now on, you have skitzofrenia and are psychopathic, you imagine everyone is plotting against you, and so you are constantly emotionally hurt by everyone, and you imagine Darth Vader behind you wherever you go, and you infect everyone who you come in contact with too. Now, with the world infected, and everyone who has the virus in a craze, and refusing treatment, the uninfected have to purge half the population. But on the bright side, your good friend Darth Vader infects and kills everyone who emotionally hurts you."

Warframe,ffjk8o6,t1_ffjiflp,1580000128.0,"We've only had one gun user though, and I think his abilities could be interesting, like how he could have bullet jump count as a jump, his roll could be held to do a slide after the roll, his abilities could be great specials/smash attacks, with side b (slash dash) radial blind (neutral b) radial javelin (down smash) switch to kunai (down b) bullet jump (up b) heavy attack (side smash) gun fire upwards (up smash) gun fire forward (neutral attack/neutral air) kick (down attack) sword combo (side attack) up slash (up attack) parazon (grab) hold direct air dodge for aim glide (side air disabled for glide), slam attack (down air) air slash (side air) parazon spike (up air, pulls opponents down) I think excalibur has so much more to offer as a smash character than just another sword fighter, and a character like that could be cool in smash."

When you get a compliment from a stranger, it always feels super genuine, and super nice. So people of reddit, always compliment your friends, but more importantly, please dont feel too awkward to compliment strangers too(as long as they're people you feel comfortable complimenting too), the joy someone can get from getting recognition from someone they don't even know can be incredible."
