Also has anyone else ever noticed that Lindo/a looks exactly like a cabbage patch doll?"

fatlogic,f908p9r,t1_f8ybyql,1574969320.0,"I saw a post by ""Fat Heffalump"" (FA screen name) a while back where she did the same thing--sat on a bench in a busy city area and had someone photograph passersby looking at her. She is really fat, BUT she had rainbow colored hair, and was wearing a dress with cockroaches printed all over it, and two different colored hightop Chucks. If I saw a THIN person dressed like that, I'd probably do a double take."
