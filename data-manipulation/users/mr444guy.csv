I was in a similar situation as you, I worked in restaurants as a busboy and waiter for a couple years when I was 18-19, but I realized I wanted more for myself. I took a GED class, then took the test and passed. I then enrolled at a community college, got my AA. Then went to a four year school and got my BA. A few years later I received my MA.

I never liked chemistry in high school, but when in college I loved it. The labs were fun, and overall I found it very interesting. Take a variety of courses you think you may like, and at some point you'll find something that sticks out.

That being said, math is one of the best degrees you can get.

I think the only other options would be to teach adults somehow. Tour guide would be fun, but as others have said, it would get boring and the pay would suck, unless you're retired. I've thought about corporate training, I used to work in industry in the chemical field, and there are people that train employees for a variety of functions.

That's what many politicians want you to believe. Why would they want you to be smart enough to see thru their bullshit. Two is because nobody actually gives a shit if kids learn or not, but what is more important is it makes the schools look good with high graduation rates.

The alcohol person was unfit to drive. 

This fits with my own experiences. I am also an avid motorcyclists. When I use weed, It makes me ride more paranoid, more defensive, more careful."

Teachers,fco1m74,t3_ei76j1,1577822439.0,Corporate trainer
Teachers,fcn13ou,t3_ehxdht,1577800212.0,"The thing I hate most about teaching is that I feel like I'm babysitting more than teaching, high school. 

I think the only other options would be to teach adults somehow. Tour guide would be fun, but as others have said, it would get boring and the pay would suck, unless you're retired. I've thought about corporate training, I used to work in industry in the chemical field, and there are people that train employees for a variety of functions. Other than something like this, teaching at the college level would involve less babysitting."
Teachers,fcmsz71,t3_ehvch9,1577790769.0,"I remind them that life is full of doing things you don't want to do. So get used to it.

But yes, schools could improve in making it more enjoyable for students. Too many schools are still run like jails."
Teachers,fckcxjv,t3_ehnrv3,1577722521.0,"You can have a fulfilling career in private schools, but be prorated to make a lot less money. At least that's how it is around me in the Northeast. And no matter where you teach, at the high school level, you will spend too much time babysitting."
Teachers,fckclx6,t1_fckbpd8,1577722309.0,I don't think you need to be certified to teach in private schools. So why would the op even worry about student teaching. The op would be better off getting a degree in the field of their choice and forgo any education courses.
education,fcjyjtu,t3_ehcha4,1577710616.0,"Two reasons. One is that there has been an anti-intellectual movement in America for some time now. Smart is not cool. And god forbid you're not cool. That's what many politicians want you to believe. Why would they want you to be smart enough to see thru their bullshit. Two is because nobody actually gives a shit if kids learn or not, but what is more important is it makes the schools look good with high graduation rates. And this is why 40% of Americans can't make an intelligent decision if their lives depended on it."
cannabis,fcfjt4i,t3_eh3t88,1577630653.0,"Saw a show on tv a few years ago. They compared driving on alcohol vs weed. We all know how that turned out. But what was somewhat surprising was people that are regular weed users showed zero impairment while driving, as opposed to the occasional weed user that did show slower reflexes. The alcohol person was unfit to drive. 

This fits with my own experiences. I am also an avid motorcyclists. When I use weed, It makes me ride more paranoid, more defensive, more careful."

Teachers,fc9cqj1,t3_egsdgg,1577550627.0,"You didn't fail them, they failed themselves. At some point kids need to take responsibility for their action, or inaction. Maybe they learned that not doing what you are supposed to do will lead to failure. That's a pretty good lesson in my book."

Teachers,fbxlc1k,t3_eeszor,1577192666.0,"Some admins will purposely write anything that needs to improve, so next time they can say there was improvement and can take the credit. It's there way of justifying their existence, which we all know is meaningless. 

I once had an admin come in for an observation as the kids were finishing a test. Luckily I had work for the kids that finished fast so they had something to do, starting the new unit. But the admin saw I did not change my Essential Questions (which we have to keep posted in our rooms) of the previous unit to the new unit yet and mentioned that in the observation. Such horse shit. Admins are useless, and a detriment to education."
