Boyfriend found out about it the next day, and was heartbroken like he wanted to get back together. I told him no because he had an accomplished anything he set out to accomplish and it doesn't matter what I do with myself what what he's doing with himself. We stayed broken up for about another 2 weeks but then he came to me and I could tell he really wanted to be back with me. so maybe show him that you can f*** another guy too and maybe he'll feel differently about it"
