MentalHealthSupport,ff504vg,t3_ermp9c,1579576685.0,"Also... I’ve worked on psych as a nurse. I’ve seen this in scenarios where it’s an auditory illusion, the static noises. I’ve seen people have inner ear issues that cause a sound in their ear. I’ve also heard of people taking meds or even acid and forever living with a brain fog that they’re unable to explain. Some people call them brain zaps but that’s moreso from benzos"

Careers,ff4z7zd,t1_ff4yohs,1579576014.0,"Ya no kidding. I’m very competent, and it’s comments like “I wouldn’t want you being my nurse” that adds to that text anxiety. Because if I do not pass, it defines me. I’m smart, graduated with honours. But to each their own so I respect your opinion. I would be too nervous for CBD during a test incase the calming effect is too calming.  I’ve decided to take a break, got a job working with mentally disabled folks and will retake the exam again once my life doesn’t depend solely on this passing. Doesn’t add that my father has essentially disowned me because of the exam."
