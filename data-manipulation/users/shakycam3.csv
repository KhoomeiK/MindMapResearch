Catswhoyell,ffj8iab,t1_ffj2lis,1579992974.0,I have hearing cats that do that.  They howl in the other room.  I call it the “I have found myself alone serenade”.
AskMen,ffj02l4,t3_etqmnk,1579986989.0,I would ask him if wanted any help with that.  Either way my next statement would be “Yes sirrrr.”
teenagers,ffizu6b,t3_etpcwo,1579986817.0,If you’re not interested in them AT ALL you are also a terrible parent.
Catswhoyell,ffixdge,t1_ffiusrh,1579985035.0,Is it hard dealing with a deaf cat?  Do you think they are any less happy?
PublicFreakout,ffitsww,t1_ffhypzf,1579982541.0,When SARS happened we were literally one plane ride from that being a worldwide Pandemic.  A plane touched down in Buffalo New York with an infected patient.  They got it turned back around to Canada at the last second.  People were placed under quarantine somewhere in Canada.  I don’t know the specific details.  SARS was much worse than most people knew.  I took an infectious disease class taught by a woman from the CDC.  She was on the front line for SARS.  She said if that plane was allowed to disembark it would have spread to the US and been out of control.
AskReddit,ffit9bb,t3_etohsu,1579982152.0,Being knocked unconscious as an easy way to get to the next scene where you are tied up.  Dude.  Concussions are very serious.  You need to take your ass to the hospital as soon as possible.
Catswhoyell,ffisq29,t3_etrusf,1579981766.0,Do deaf cats ears move at all?  Usually they are moving them to pick up sound.  I’ve always wondered that.  This guys ears didn’t move at all.
AskMen,ffhs987,t1_ffh6frd,1579951246.0,"It made sense in the comics.  The show hadn’t earned something that gruesome, really.  And TV Negan was portrayed differently than the dialogue from the comics, like the words he was saying didn’t match the actor.  It was just an awkward scene.  And yes the cliffhanger was really infuriating.

As far as peeing my pants about a good character dying?  I had lost all sympathy for the group by that time.  They broke into a building and slit a bunch of peoples throats while they were sleeping.  Supposedly they were “bad guys” but come on.  That crossed a line and your ass is gonna pay.  

I ended up quitting awhile later.  I think it was around the time of the Vegas shooting.  I just got tired of watching people machine gun each other for supplies."
AskMen,ffhrykx,t1_ffg9w8w,1579950801.0,Negan in the comics is based on Henry Rollins.  He actually auditioned for the part and didn’t get it.

news,ffh1goc,t1_fffma9y,1579920563.0,"I used to wish for a zombie apocalypse because at least then I wouldn’t have to go to work.  I really really hated my job.

gaybros,ffesltl,t1_ffejlt5,1579863558.0,I loved the ending of “Slumdog Millionaire”.  Made everyone want to dance in the aisles of the theater.
