You have no idea if I am legitimately offended by the use of the word ignorant but instead you choose to ASSUME that I am being disingenuous and continue to use the word, based on nothing more than a few reddit posts.  
  
While it's understood by the vast majority of people that the derogatory use of the word ""gay"" has evolved beyond homophobia, in an almost comical manner, you seem to tie every use of the word ""gay"" to homophobia regardless of context, for your own virtue signalling. However, when I request the same respect by eliminating a word such as 'ignorant', which can still be hurtful and damaging under the same conditions, YOU deem the word acceptable and instead of ""easily"" changing your vocabulary you argue and disregard the potential damage to my emotional state. Why?! I don't know, maybe because it's beyond your scope of understanding or maybe you're just a stubborn, self-obsessed cunt but maybe because deep down you understand, while words can be hurtful, pushing others to censor themselves on your behalf rather than you censoring your own exposure to those offenses is fucking bonkers and self-centered. See now that I've made my point, you stupid cow, I will show you how easily its done by simply blocking your ignorant garbage."

MurderedByWords,fek0dnp,t1_fejz6pg,1579189908.0,"It impossible to pay any worker their true value to the company, unless your running a non-profit or at a loss. What's important is to create a sense of need to work so that those workers will devalue their own efforts in the name of survival.
