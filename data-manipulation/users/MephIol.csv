The whole point is that I'm not. The point is that evidence-based nutrition isn't anecdotal and takes a holistic approach aka systems thinking. The point is that most people know fuck all about nutrition and that fad diets are full of anecdotes and pseudoscience.

GetMotivated,feaapdg,t1_fe9tvgs,1578946361.0,"Let's start out with science doesn't care what you think, nor do your organs. 

OK, now let's talk about how even carnivorous diets use supplements and are more so chronically deficient in minerals and vitamins. Iron can be found in lots of vegetables and good supplements are used for all diets.

It's about learning, sure, but please don't discount science for entrenching personal anecdote and a stubbornness."

GetMotivated,fe9sptc,t1_fe9r6n4,1578941144.0,"I'm mostly in agreement. The problem is that caloric density is a major contributor and ppl in all diets abuse sauces/oils /sugars and things with insulin issues. 

We should stop proliferating bunk science and the fad diets and get back to promoting absolute basics with data behind them so the choices are much more narrow. Plant based diets are demonstrably cheaper and better for both short term issues and long term lives.

Even a meat diet stuck to for a while will fucking kill ppl early. Sounds worse than some discipline to me. Got an underlying mental health challenge associated with eating? Get to a professional and be the best person you can be!

But no, we don't need to encourage settling and taking poor advice. I trust an MD more than a platitude."
GetMotivated,fe9oeur,t1_fe957sl,1578939963.0,"Love the feeling this brings!   


However, the 3500 thing is not true. I just went to a lecture by Dr Michael Greger, and in summary: [https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-3500-calorie-per-pound-rule-is-wrong/](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-3500-calorie-per-pound-rule-is-wrong/)  


He also advocates, rightfully so, that a plant-based diet is far superior for weight loss than any other due to caloric density of plant-based foods being lower, and require more food to get the same amount of cals, so you eat less and naturally lose weight. It exceeds a keto diet, or any other, and without any of the strain and harm on your organs that traditional diets do. Also, it's just better overall for health long-term.  


It took me 35 years to switch from meat and potatoes, and still spoil myself with animal protein for super special occasions, however the science is clear as day."

classicwow,fczcic3,t1_fcz0tnl,1578098167.0,"min/maxing is a funny thing because most people under that denigrated term now (idek how that came to be) are looking for GROWTH and to LEARN. That each week they get a little bit better.   


What's so bad about that?  


On the other side of the coin, we have people who love comfort and embracing things as they are, not as they could be. After all, it's easier that way and requires less effort. Fine, but don't drag people who enjoy growing. if anything, most of us are sick of watching the mediocre drag on the innovators. This is beyond WoW. This is about being surrounded by people who settle.   


Min/max is about encouraging the best of each other. See it however makes ppl feel more safe and comfortable. Casual has nothing to do with that as many of us are raid loggers. Theorycrafting and number crunching is at its core, a learning methodology."
gaming,fcsvzqf,t1_fcsmj00,1577926518.0,All too often we quit when things are a challenge and miss an opportunity to grow. Games as escapism are a waste of a better life led. Games as an addition to life are what they are meant for.

Martial arts all teach that the first step of any engagement is to avoid engaging altogether. Clearly this wasn't a situation where the shirtless guy was a threat.   


My Sifu (Wing Chun) had a guy come to challenge him in our studio - he pushed back several times verbally and the guy wouldn't stop asking for a challenge. My Sifu picked up the phone and dialed a non-emergency ambulatory service. To the challengers surprise, he asked, ""Why?"" Sifu: because one of us isn't walking out of here.  


The challenger accepted that as symbolic enough for a loss and stood down.
