pathofexile,ffff9ge,t1_fffe790,1579882687.0,"I'm a noob too. From the little experience I have, here's what has been working for me.

1) Use a strict loot filter so garbage doesn't even show up. [https://filterblade.xyz/](https://filterblade.xyz/)

2) I use Trade Macro ([https://poe-trademacro.github.io/](https://poe-trademacro.github.io/)) to do quick price checks on anything I think might be worth 5c+, if it shows up under 2c I just vendor it. Sure I probably miss some good items, but efficiency is a thing.

If something shows up 25c+ or 1ex+, or is just interesting/unusual to me, I do a manual search on [https://www.pathofexile.com/trade/search/Metamorph](https://www.pathofexile.com/trade/search/Metamorph), be sure to use a nice range of values on the mods so you're not just showing super specific results, and pretty much just use the best mods/rolls on the items (as using all the mods probably will make you overvalue the item, since there won't be many results). Be sure to check for offline results too, not just the players that are online. Price accordingly, reducing every few days or week if you want.
