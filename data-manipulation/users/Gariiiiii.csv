todayilearned,fgq57y1,t1_fgq01ok,1581018094.0,Yeah corporations and people are the same. Good thing we finally realized and gave em equal rights.
todayilearned,fgpwy7b,t1_fgpurfq,1581013593.0,"In this case? Forever IMO.

A company is not ""someone"", in this case the owners would rather have a good brand that is build over slavery than a fresh start. They are not guilty of it, but shows that a company first priority is to make money, which should be obvious anyway."
todayilearned,fgnzc4u,t1_fgnwanm,1580956235.0,"I am no fan of Apple, they aren't a sensible choice for me. But this is BS.

Stuff that has intelectual work behind can't be messured like that, by that standard you can say musicians, graphic designers or programmers have near infinity profits."
datascience,ffsec3h,t3_euv2ok,1580179646.0,"For data science/analytics it really doesn't matter, go Win imo and do a virtual linux but whatever works.

For data engenieering/develop DS solutions you would be mad not having a Linux around. Wins currently are just not viable and Macs are such a pain being non standard UNIX that probably not worth the time."
Grimdank,ffscyrm,t1_ffqxa66,1580178739.0,Audiobooks. You can get a book per month on the commute without even trying.
Database,ffc2tro,t1_ffbqwds,1579790142.0,"I dont, at all. Postgres is the best DB, but it wont do what OP says out of the box, he would need to build a ton of stuff for business and presentation."
Database,ffc2own,t1_ffbzqin,1579790043.0,"This so much. You DONT want a database, but an open source business software. Odoo fits the bill like a charm, go for it IMO."

That company has a yearly revenue of 52.747 billion USD a year, cant have a feaking website lol."
hacking,fetrwlu,t1_fetnsiy,1579379236.0,"And yet some sites only work on IE, not even Edge."

movies,fengo17,t1_fene4ei,1579284286.0,"All I read is ""reeeee my times were better!!"".

Big studios have always been into money, directors that make a killing at the box office have always been hired for that. Dont want adults that love merchandize? Maybe dont raise them trough the 80s & 90s watching shows that focused on that."
comedyhomicide,femihex,t1_femg2tw,1579257276.0,"That's false. Just take 1/3=0.3333... for example, that number combination (infinite string of 3s starting from the nth digit) is not there."
oddlyterrifying,fee51pk,t1_fedu9kr,1579026543.0,Bro our timeline has Vag scented candles and the POTUS arguing on twitter with a kid. I take everything at face value unless i see an /s.
oddlyterrifying,fedti0u,t1_fednwx9,1579019557.0,"Perfect, so with this revised figures you will use 1K ish in an edgy unsound method. Duno, i pass, but might be fun for ppl who find shooting rats and blowing up corpses fun, each its own."
oddlyterrifying,fedmi01,t1_fecj7i4,1579015149.0,"Not really, that's like 80,000.00 USD just on the tannerite and will just blow the corpse up till kigndom come. But it does sounds fun."
oddlyterrifying,fecezk1,t1_fececkk,1578972332.0,Because such a lump of meat is a biohazard and should be disposed of in a manner it doesn't bring harm onto others.
SASSWitches,fe0ggj7,t3_enj3kv,1578813044.0,"Best of luck sibling! For the most part I gave up trying to find what I want, nowdays I focus on what I need; still if something along the way sparks joy in me I'll procure it."
MurderedByWords,fdyiqj9,t1_fdy0ru6,1578780180.0,"But she is on both accounts, vaccines don't create super bugs and higher survival rate on kids is liked to lower population growth due better planification.

She is giving BS reasons and ignoring current demographics."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,fdnvl52,t1_fdnpz0y,1578593732.0,"Ok, amazing! Work will be totally crazy for a time, but already did a remind me bot for the 20th.

The current plan is get the mails into a standard open elastic stack docker with documented process so it can be replicated ezly. Then start poking and probing before using kibana for some serious ml probing when we know what it might contain. What do you think  sibling? Sounds like a good plan?"

SASSWitches,fdnu25f,t3_emblw0,1578592836.0,"I don't share this, but I respect it. In college I majored in abstract algebra and basics of quantum physics, most of it forgotten now but enough reminds to know that:

- Yeah the observer effect exists, but it doesn't proves or states any of what is said, just that you can't observe a phenomenon without changing it.
- For the influencing each other with Higgs boson particles it is terribly unlikely and have zero reasons to believe it. You can craft that narrative with absolutely any physics effect, like saying the Edison effect charges us with energy due the release of electrons in cathodes.
- For the blessed chocolate and crystals, I wasn't able to find a peer reviewed source. Would love to see the methodology.

And it baffles me, why force a hodgepodge of non understood concepts into reinforce previous beliefs? Why buy a book by a guy whose PhD is by a Univ infamous for being quack?

I do rituals, yoga, meditation, witchcraft, try to practice kindness, conscious breathing, focus on the idea of my spirit, etc. because it's good to me and I see the changes. I think is hubris to think humans are special and have magic powers that affect the material universe; but we ARE special in the sense that we can, trough good practices, change ourselves which is magical for me.

Of course I might be wrong, and we might be super special in the universe with powers capable of bending the material world. If so I would love to realize before too late and it would bring me an immense joy.

TL;DR. I respect the vid, but don't think it has one gram of science. And still witchcraft can change you for the good."
