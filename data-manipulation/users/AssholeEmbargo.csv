Simply not true. Alaska has the most open gun laws in the country and the murder rate per population is extremely low, while places that have strict gun laws - DC, CA, NY, NJ, Chicago, all have high murder rates.

&#x200B;

>and as i said, ""stricts"" gunlaws in the usa are a joke

That's a pretty murky statement. What exactly are strict gun laws? Further, what are strict gun laws that have proven to save lives? Is the point just so we can pat ourselves on the back and say ""we have strict gun laws. at least we feel like we've done something""

&#x200B;

>Those people are like you and me. If you have a very hard time to acquire firearms, it's also harder for them (because no, the average criminal doesn't know how to acquire illegal weapon and don't have the balls for that).

Where do you get this from? We have an extremely high rate of people being murdered by fist, feet, clubs, blunt weapons, etc. Thousands and thousands of incidents of people killing one another without a gun.

&#x200B;

>Also, as i said, those laws aren't very effective when you can buy a gun in the neighbour state which has completely different laws.

Again, what laws are you referring to?

&#x200B;

>If strict gunlaws like in switzerland or france (i'm not even talking of the hardest gunlaws like in japan, china or asia as a whole) were applied in the entirety of the country AND were actually enforced, it would work like in literally every country where it happened (australia, switzerland, france...).

[Australia](https://www.reddit.com/r/Firearms/comments/65d1bp/dispelling_the_myth_of_australias_gun_control/) and the UK are prime examples of where it has *not* worked. Australia hasn't reduced their homicide rate because of their ban. In fact it spiked higher than in previous decades after the ban. Even the University of Melbourne in their study ["" The Australian Firearms Buyback and Its Effect on Gun Deaths""](https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/downloads/working_paper_series/wp2008n17.pdf) stated:

    ""Homicide patterns (firearm and nonfirearm) were not influenced by the NFA. They therefore concluded that the gun buy5 back and restrictive legislative changes had no influence on firearm homicide in Australia.""

&#x200B;

>It's of course helped becayse they actually enforce laws and that the laws are usually for the entire country, while every state to their own shit in the USA

Again, explain how enforcing laws reduces homicide. We put people to death and it's no deterrent, they still rob, rape, and kill."
