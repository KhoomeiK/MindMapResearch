ChoosingBeggars,ff53xfa,t1_ff4xou5,1579579548.0,I mean if you work for a neighborhood market and get a good manager its a hell of an improvement from babysitting. I considered it a huge step up from when I was working fast food

EntitledPeople,ff30a87,t1_ff2u6u5,1579530200.0,One of the high schools I ended up going to only had 68 students total. They would still jump in and have jumped in before from a crazy student cussing out a teacher. Idk I guess its shock or they didn't want to get involved

facepalm,fdrwumf,t1_fdr1fqd,1578690871.0,I found out I was pregnant at seven months as well (30 weeks to be exact). I didn't even show until then and I had so much going on at the time I assumed that it was stress causing the irregular periods. Ended up giving birth at 37 1/2 weeks.

EntitledPeople,fdj260s,t3_elnakx,1578456502.0,I mean you probably could have explained to her that the managers have to do that then go get the manager for her. Yeah she was a bitch but that's just retail. I'd probably go get the manager so I wouldn't have to listen to the bitch complain

EntitledPeople,fdj0xrc,t3_ellmaq,1578455642.0,"That's wild man. I'm a regular at my local pizza hut, they kinda know my order and address just by my name at this point lol. I did get free sauce once though when I went in one time. I explained I had a pizza delivered but I forgot to order sauce so I went in to buy it and they just gave it to me. 

Honestly if the dude just wanted sauce he could probably just go in and if they're nice like at mine they might just give it to him free of charge"
