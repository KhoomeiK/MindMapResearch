It’s not apparent when wearing shoes but when i am walking around my place with out my shoes, I have to give the pant legs a roll at the bottom or they could drag on the floor. But 28 inseam are hard to find and aren’t long enough (especially when sitting).

Let's say I wanted to be a bus driver - Metro Transit does not even have convenient routes to its own garages! They have a route to the Heywood Garage but there are four other garages in the system an at least two of them are nearly impossible to get to from public transportation. So if you wanted to be an operator as a career you could not live carfree in the Twin Cities. That's always a huge design flaw that I've found annoying, and it's kept me from making a career change from CPA to bus operator."

If you can't get a date, you are a loser and you have no reason to live.

I have people telling me I look okay, I look fine, etc....this is SO damaging. These lies are like really bad intel when you in a forward operating area and you have enemy snipers in front of you. I don't know why loved ones give me bad intel, but they do - AND THEY KEEP DOING IT!. Every time I go out I need to minimize my exposure because I am in danger of being judged as an ugly fucking loser, and that I have no justification to keep living. When my loved ones tell me I look okay, it is bad fucking intel - it makes me leave my apartment and be seen among others and expose my position and leave me vulnerable to judgements as a loser who doesn't deserve to keep taking up space. I don't know why my loved ones do this - give me bad intel - but they do, and they keep doing it. When my wife left me earlier last year, what I should have done was do everything to keep her because I am a fucking loser who doesn't deserve to keep living, and it was the best I would ever get despite any abuse she put upon me (I deserved it). But I listened to family who gave me bad intel - they fucking lied to me. ""I'd be okay"" they said. No, that is bad intel - the correct answer was supposed to be ""you are a complete fucking loser who doesn't deserve to live and you would never get a date on a friday night because of your loserdom, you need to take what you can get"". Now I am in the position where, as a complete fucking loser who doesn't deserve to live, I have no hope of ever finding anyone who would ever like me and all I get is bad fucking intel from my family and I have no options left."
TwinCities,fdyzik6,t3_en25n5,1578785177.0,We desperately need more people to give up driving in favor of public transportation and other means of cleaner travel. Doing nothing to make transit a desirable choice will cost more in terms of environmental impact in the long run. This means more policing of bad behavior. Transit was not designed to be a refuge for the homeless and a cure-all for people on the margins. it was designed to get people to choose transit over driving and reduce overall carbon footprint.
BodyDysmorphia,fdyj4mf,t3_en92w7,1578780335.0,"I also have this problem and I don’t understand why people don’t tell me the truth. Let’s face it - every millimeter deviation from the mean is a contributor to unappealing appearance. I have researched what makes people attractive and the general conclusion is that ‘average ness’ is what makes a person attractive. I get people telling me that I’m handsome or at least average looking and it really makes me upset because I can show where I’m sometimes a whole standard deviation away from what constitutes average according to facebase. This makes me sure that people are lying to me and I don’t have bdd, it’s just people are not being honest with me. 

I don’t think I have bdd anymore - I just think I’m far too strange lookin due to my measurements and comparison against a know set of standards. I’m not saying nobody would find me attractive, but I need to know that a decent percentage of the people out there would not find me repulsive. And with the calculations I have been tracking, I don’t have any assurance. That uncertainty makes it hard for me to go outside and be seen in public."

I have things that are considered pluses - a good career and my own place. But I know there is absolutely no shot for me to ever find love again. First, some internet people told me why my face will never ever be attractive to women. My eyes are a little big and according to the research I have done, this has the tendency to come off as creepy. I am extremely introverted and never approached a woman before in person (my ex-wife was the one that wooed me). I am extremely shy because I think nobody should ever, ever like me due to my flaws and imperfections. Also, I’m short for a male - 5’7” and I’ll never be able to get anyone to take me seriously at that point. According to my research, women overwhelmingly like tall men.

I become suicidal over the Christmas holiday, and this is what I see is my destiny. I’ve realized dating is just a no-go for someone like me, who Was born so defective and worthless that I actually ruin people’s experience by being in their presence.

loneliness,fdna0fp,t3_em7an4,1578581201.0,"My biggest issue is that I am convinced several of my facial measurements combine to make an unpleasant experience for people and that nobody would ever want to know me; that I would actually ruin their life experience if I tried to socialize with them. Also, I read online that having slightly big eyes contributes to the appearance of 'bulgy' eyes which is the hallmark of a creep. I don't want to be perceived as a creep and so I will never, ever approach anyone to socialize for fear  of being perceived as creepy. 

Basically, it's part protection - I need to make sure I am not hurt, and also a measure of knowing that I have absolutely no value, no worth to anyone and nobody should ever be subjected to dealing with me. I mean, I have to work to live so there is no avoiding subjecting other people to myself in a professional situation.

MBA,fc77zd2,t3_egk6ik,1577499955.0,"I went to a business school that is very similar (in all earnestness) to Chico. I took five graduate-level accounting courses and one management course but I did not complete an MBA or a masters-level degree as I realized I was wasting my time and my employer's money.

That material that you learn at Chico and any other (particularly accounting) can be learned anywhere. Go to Half Price Books and pick up some old textbooks in accounting/management. ""Teaching"" business seems ridiculous to me because you learn business by being in it. There is a case to be made for formal education accounting (and indeed, the accounting credits I earned I applied towards CPA licensure) - but it's a dubious one. I'm a CPA and think that all that should be required to be licensed is an associates degree + a couple of intermediate accounting courses.

I found the graduate-level management course to be an absolute joke. Finance - even worse.

M7/Top Business Schools are not so much ""schools"" as prestige pipelines. IF you wanna be the type of person that hob-nobs with elites, works for companies like McKinsey (ugh), and is all about social climbing, go there. You will do case studies that are already mostly outdated but make lots of connections and probably get a good salary + bonus when you graduate. You have a good chance if you go through one of these prestige pipelines. If you look up to a guy like Pete  Buttigieg, this is your path.

Don't get an MBA from anything other than these schools - it's largely a waste of your time and money. If you want to really learn a business from the ground up, either take a few accounting classes and get into accounting with some local firm, or join as a grunt and work your way up (I advise people to go become union electricians and work through the ops of a company and really know it). Management often doesn't know shit about operations in my experience with most companies that I have been with. If you want to be like Mike Rowe, this is your path.
