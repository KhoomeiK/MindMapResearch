timberwolves,fel2by3,t1_fekvup2,1579212538.0,Cheers. Sounds like a decent trade then
timberwolves,fekuxmw,t1_fekcnba,1579208117.0,I'm still new to basketball in terms of what good %s are over a long season. Is that bad? Also if if is bad by comparison to the top PG's is that bad for a team in our current predicament
AskReddit,feeyvu4,t1_fedza7j,1579044256.0,Plus the way he says pack makes if sound American where you have tiny little 330 cans. Rather than 440 or pint cans. I had 4 pints tonight and don't class that as drinking on a work night.

todayilearned,fedtj0h,t3_eohl47,1579019575.0,"No public celebrations indeed. I don't like the Royals at all, but it was always nice when you'd get a day off to ""celebrate"" their stuff. It's about the only good I find them. But no, this selfish woman decides not to make a big deal out of making history but we still have royal baby days all over the place"

SWGalaxyOfHeroes,fdvfph9,t1_fdun1ff,1578746961.0,I mean the star wars universe does celebrate Christmas. We are in that universe. Star Wars clearly states the events happened a long time a go in a galaxy far far away. Not in a different universe.

Wait what does Finn need to tell Rey? Shhh here's a giant snake... Wait what's this force heal, how did she learn that? Shhh here's a mcguffin... Wait why can't the just reprogram 3PO of they remove his memory and coding how does he remember the translation? Shhh here's Rey back flipping over a fighter that has different wing shapes depending on the part of the scene... Wait how did she do that, I mean her arm would rip off as lightsabers don't cut through metal that easily... Shh here's force lighning.. wait (I could go on)"

Showerthoughts,fdi6v4p,t3_elede8,1578436790.0,I think it's more because there's so many streaming services to pay for I personally feel I shouldn't have to then rent individually. Especially when they only have parts of trilogies or only the sequel of a film on their service but not part 1
todayilearned,fde0y4m,t1_fddscmf,1578328699.0,Can some one eli5 this as I'm clearly having a moment understanding this. So they don't want people to work for the government? How does that discourage you staying tribal

AskReddit,fcm1pc4,t1_fclga5i,1577761932.0,Gotta love it when you watch a text. Doesn't quite have the same ring to it as hearing an image
todayilearned,fcm1d2w,t1_fclbqaa,1577761683.0,"My much more less serious version of this was when I woke up and was struggling to breath as something kept blocking my throat. I had heavily drank the night before but other than a slightly burnt pizza I ate and all the booze I didn't put anything else in my throat. I was stupidly honest with them about drinking and after 5 hours eventually a nurse snapped at me and said ""if you don't tell us what you swallowed we can't do anything"". I replied with ""it's right at the top of my throat though so can you please just look"" . I have a terrible gag reflex mind you so it was a struggle. Turns out my uvula was crazy swollen and kept blocking my throat. The nurse said next time to not mention I was drinking because it made them think I'd done something crazy and was lying about it. Still not sure why it took them so long to even have a look mind."

timberwolves,fc3urhg,t3_eg052f,1577399151.0,"My friends like basketball. I never followed it and tried but without a team to follow I'd lose interest. I knew a guy who was a green bay Packers fan and saw which state they were from, combined with my cousin having moved to Minnesota and me not wanting to be a guy who just picks a winning team I ended up being a timberwolves fan. Haven't looked back since, although it is tough to look back when the team hasn't gone anywhere in 3 years. Playoffs was a nice thing given we had the longest drought at the time. Even if the showing was a bit poor. Onwards and upwards guys"
