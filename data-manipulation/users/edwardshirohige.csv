depression,fefyrxb,t3_eophbs,1579069812.0,"This makes me feel like I don't deserve to be on this subreddit. Dude if you've made it through all this then you'll make it through anything.

depression,fc58j5z,t3_efyc5z,1577448627.0,"Huh..! Thought I was the only one. Been there done that and it feels terrible. I usually try to act on it but there's usually something really really weird, that I or no one saw coming, happens and screws everything up and it leaves me miserable. I've been through this cycle several times and three of them lasted over a year. Now I'm just someone who's afraid of putting too much effort into anything because something out of the blue will happen and screw things up, I might as well as save myself the effort.

  This shit has taken me from one stubborn never say never mind set to a guy who gives up way too easily. And the worst part people are like bro, you've not been through a break up, it's much worse. Well, guess what I'll never have a break up or even a real relationship for that matter. I've just given up on everything, I don't expect or even hope for anything good to happen because you know they say that hope is the worst evil. It encourages you to endure all that shit so you're even more miserable and worn out when life fucks you over."
BreadTube,fc57kfi,t3_efy2d0,1577447282.0,"  First of all, I completely agree that this bill is against the very basic ideology of the Indian constitution. But, here is something I haven't been able to understand, how does this bill serve as a backdoor entry to citizenship to INDIAN hindus, buddhists, sikhs and christians? 
  
  To be able to get fast track naturalised citizenship through the CAA one would have to prove that he/she is a citizen of those specific three countries. So, if there is an NRC, it'll be equally difficult for INDIANS of all religions to prove their citizenship.

  As I've already said the bill is unjust, specifically to the Muslim refugees of those countries, or refugees from other countries and it definitely threatens to endanger them. But even they have a way to become naturalised Indian citizens. And that is something that  is worth protesting against. 

  But, the bill/act is being projected as something way more evil and sinister than it actually is. The bill, in no perceivable way can act as a means to endanger INDIAN Muslims and their well being. I just hope that they'd understand this somehow. 

  Yet, I'm happy that some of us are standing up for the rights of refugees and thinking as global citizens rather than being chained by the narrow walls of nationalism. And this is truly the spirit of India, ""Vasudheiva Kutumbakam"" which translates to the world is my family."
