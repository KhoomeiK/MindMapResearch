aww,fffmoac,t3_et8myx,1579887257.0,"Yeah, my cat passed away a few days ago. I just wish I could still do the same thing with him, but he’s gone forever. He was only 2 years old and some idiot was driving too fast on our road and left him to suffer. My friend’s parents found him a little while later (an hour) and graciously took him to the vet in attempt to save him. Unfortunately he died right after they got there and they couldn’t do anything about it. I never got to see him one last time before he died; not even during his suffering. He was always there for me. I’m just grateful that he died in the hands of someone else and didn’t die alone. If he were to die in my hands I would’ve been devastated. So many people that I don’t even know have helped me so much within the past few days trying to find him, and I can’t really return the favor. The thing that pisses me off the most is the guy who ran him over just kept going. I mean the least he could do is pull over and take him off the road."
