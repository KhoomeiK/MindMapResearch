I would recommend losing the identical ability with Chirrut, giving Chirrut a power action to do a riposte and Baze having more health (12?) since he is bulkier.

swdestiny,fet5bli,t1_fesh7ol,1579371947.0,It’s a waste compared to other actions in the action economy. The other player gets a card too or you discard a card that still may be valuable unless it is another “I have spoken.” It is like the cards that give one resource to everyone but those cards have ambush. An alternative would be that you keep the card in your hand to replay and could choose to discard it instead of the revealed card if you spot Kuill. Or limit the ambush if you spot Kuill.

At that price it should have ambush and redeploy since Carra used it, or perhaps something that prevents its removal. 

I like the idea of I Have Spoken but I would add ambush because otherwise it is a waste of an action or make it so the player has the choice of drawing your card or discarding their card so there is no downside, or even doing both (with a limitation such as you can’t play two I have spoken in a row would need to be added to prevent aggressive milling.) 

Thematically, “I have spoken” stops the Mandolorian from speaking, so another idea would be a support where you could play for free (or perhaps refresh) if you spot Kuill which you can exhaust to stop the other player from playing a second action."
