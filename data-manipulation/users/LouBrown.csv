It would pretty much just be speculation.  Tesla hasn't announced anything, and there have likely only been a handful of prototypes made.  Existing Tesla vehicles have performed well in crash testing, so it's not an unreasonable assumption that future ones will too.  But it's certainly no guarantee.

Having said that, it's a safe assumption that the truck will be a very heavy vehicle.  Batteries are heavy, after all.

The above poster used the term in the sense of percent of rated range the car gets when it's cold.  That is not the normal usage of the term.

If the Model 3 gets 65% of its rated range when cold, and the Model S gets 70% of its rated range when it's cold, then the Model 3 still uses less power to travel the same distance.  And that's what I mean when I say the Model 3 is more efficient."

With watching sports, in addition to seeing talented athletes and coaches working against each other, you also enjoy the drama of not knowing how the game is going to end, who's going to be the star, etc.

Being a fan gives you something you can talk to people about and bond with even if you don't know them.  I think [this speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ybgef4gBl6A) makes a good point.

Say you split up bills as a married couple.  One person pays the mortgage, the other person pays the utilities.  Does that mean in a divorce the person who paid the mortgage bill gets to keep the house, and the other person deserves nothing since the electric, water, and trash are already used and paid?  

Or perhaps a married couple makes an agreement where one parent stays home, raises the kids, and is a homemaker while the other parent works a job.  If they get divorced, does that mean the stay at home parent deserves to keep no assets, because they didn't earn or pay for anything individually?

But once you get married, you live, earn, work, and spend as a team.    If you don't like the idea of these things being done collectively, then marriage probably isn't for you.

Say you split up bills as a married couple.  One person pays the mortgage, the other person pays the utilities.  Does that mean in a divorce the person who paid the mortgage bill gets to keep the house, and the other person deserves nothing since the electric, water, and trash are already used and paid?  

Or perhaps a married couple makes an agreement where one parent stays home, raises the kids, and is a homemaker while the other parent works a job.  If they get divorced, does that mean the stay at home parent deserves to keep no assets, because they didn't earn or pay for anything individually?

It's good practice to either cut up the vegetables first or just wash your knife and board after cutting the meat, though.  Shit happens, for lack of a better term.  That way you don't have to worry about a dog/roommate/whoever swiping a piece of carrot that has mingled with raw chicken.  There are also fewer worries about accidentally smearing/spreading meat juice on the counter, etc."

They don't.  If a Tesla crashes in Kalamazoo and nobody writes an article about it, how would you know?  You wouldn't.  It's confirmation bias.

There is little to no meaningful data comparing this.

From the [Q1 earnings call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/04/25/tesla-inc-tsla-q1-2019-earnings-call-transcript.aspx):

>All Tesla cars being built today have all hardware necessary for full self-driving and over-the-air updates will enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailing network fleet and generate income, which, as we said on Autonomy Day a few days ago, we think it's somewhere between $10,000 and $30,000 a year. In some cases, perhaps more.

Also, from [Autonomy Day](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/tesla-elon-musk-robotaxi/):

>By the middle of next year, weâ€™ll have over a million Tesla cars on the road with full self-driving hardware, feature complete, at a reliability level that we would consider that no one needs to pay attention"
