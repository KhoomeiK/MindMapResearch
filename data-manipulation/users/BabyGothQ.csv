FemaleDatingStrategy,ffj9inp,t3_etkwkz,1579993604.0,"Think of it this way: in gay and lesbian relationships the norm is either the person who asked the other on a date pays or they split the bill because they’re each on equal footing in terms of gender equality.

Men and women are not. They each bring different things to the table. 

That’s why we say don’t ask out men and let them pursue you, because when you become the pursuer the expectation becomes that you are the one footing the bill - and that’s just on dates. 

If you ask out men they don’t feel the need to try. You lose value in their eyes, but they won’t admit that. When/If that changes, it could be more like same sex relationships where the asker pays, regardless of gender. 

But it’s just not. 

From my experience, or perhaps stereotypes, feel free to disagree, gay relationships are more centered around sex, whereas lesbian relationships are more centered around intimacy.

confession,fds6m36,t3_emul6e,1578695526.0,Lmao I think we’ve all done that as kids OP
FemaleDatingStrategy,fds493o,t1_fdrd5te,1578694038.0,"Like someone else said, maybe OP, men are takers, not givers. So if you’re in a relationship with a LVM they aren’t looking out for your best interests (helping you live your best life, making sure your garden is watered, rooting you on in your career/hobbies), they’re just taking everything you have to give so that there’s nothing left for you - not even time to think about yourself."
AmItheAsshole,fdojkrl,t3_ema2lf,1578606448.0,"YTA. You obviously don’t understand what it is to care for something other than yourself. Do you even care about yourself? Do you have insurance for your car? Do you take yourself to the doctor when something is wrong? I doubt it.

So let me revise.

You obviously don’t understand what it is to care."
lawofattraction,fdoibku,t1_fdo20xh,1578605723.0,"I don’t think a few of you are understanding what OP is saying lol it’s like when you know you have your favorite ice cream waiting for you in the freezer, but you’re at work right now. 

It is yours right now, you will just enjoy it later."

facepalm,fdoanb0,t1_fdmy6ov,1578601767.0,But not Iran.
FemaleDatingStrategy,fdmkvwv,t3_elzh8d,1578553738.0,"Reframe it in your emotions and thoughts as learning much needed lessons. Feel the feeling of being proud of yourself for how much you’ve learned and for bettering yourself whereas these men who used your pickemeisha-ness probably will not grow or learn anything. 

You’re ahead of the game by even recognizing your past behavior. If you make mistakes in the future just know that you had to learn that lesson again because you didn’t the first time and isn’t it great that you got the chance to do that?

Also, try doing revision. Pick a particularly cringe moment for you, and as you’re going through it in your mind, imagining where you were, who you were with, what was said and done, simply.. change it. It didn’t happen that way at all. Revise it so that what you wish or wanted to happen *did*. Feel the pride, the joy, the thrill of what you now imagine happened. Sit in that for a little bit, maybe laugh or go “boy, bye”, whatever you would naturally do or say when remembering the memory you just changed."

AmItheAsshole,fdmjmns,t3_em00la,1578552322.0,"NTA. I don’t see how you could possibly be the asshole in this situation. It’s not like you watched her tripping on the treadmill then she fell in your view. 

You were minding your business after she insulted you and obviously didn’t want you looking at her, and **heard** her fall lol she’s a big girl, she can get back up. 

Also, you let the owners know what happened - again that’s not your business, it’s between her, God, and the owner of the gym lmao"
facepalm,fdmi2i7,t3_elz208,1578550664.0,Did.. did someone actually say that Iran is in Texas?
insaneparents,fdj0qoi,t3_elfuuq,1578455505.0,This is.. fucked up and ignorant as hell.
YouShouldKnow,fdj0lpi,t1_fdizf0g,1578455405.0,"Lol. But you can verbalize that choice whereas cats will eat what they like/tastes good without care for their digestive.. yup, you know what lol spot on"
AskReddit,fdizfpy,t1_fdhfswa,1578454600.0,"Oh, see, I thought you were going to say the much more prevalent armchair expert who stalks through your profile for ammo to “destroy” you with because you dared to post an opinion or experience that goes against the hive mind-meld that is Reddit."
dating,fdihmrf,t1_fdhwmmr,1578443118.0,"People who live and die by OLD and statistics aren’t really in a position to be commenting on real life dating experiences. Just my opinion. 

I’ve dated and known quite a few guys who aren’t considered “conventionally attractive” or “bad boys” and it’s still like this. Even guys who I considered nice and who didn’t insist they were nice guys turned out to be raging douches. I don’t think that’s an isolated experience. I also know many women who have LTD and married far below their supposed “league” and are treated like trash.

It’s not about being hot or being a bad boy. 

That may be my specific experience, I’m willing to say so, but I’ve met a lot of different people from different places and I really don’t think so."
