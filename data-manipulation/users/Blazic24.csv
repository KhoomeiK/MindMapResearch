LucidDreaming,fe0lnyz,t3_enjtjq,1578815667.0,"As others have said, you're likely just not remembering your dreams.

Trying to remember them helps, going through what you can remember as soon as you wake up - over time, you'll likely get better.

Especially for me, actually journaling the dreams helped a ton. As soon as I'd wake up, I'd get on my phone and write down everything I could remember, details as well as main events. I'd try to write sequentially, but that's not always possible, as you tend to remember more as you go. Instead of going back and editing, I'd simply right 'at x point, y happened', or write 'something happened between a and b but I dont remember what', as if I was talking to someone. It helps to not interrupt the flow of thought.

The first couple nights you'll likely have trouble, but it helps, even, to write in whatever journal you used that you couldn't remember a dream that night, or, if you can recall them, even vague themes they surrounded."
magicbuilding,fe0f9qz,t3_enfsnu,1578812413.0,"On Iundes, magic is a simple exertion of one's will, provided they have the energy and concentration to put behind it. Because of this, there's no 'dark' magic, but my favorite morally-char usage is what I call 'necrobiology' - Parts from different living creatures combined into one new creature. On a morally lighter usage, this 'type' of magic can also be used for creating prosthetics for those that have lost limbs, or, with care, add completely new parts to bodies. 

Prosthetics and 'full fledged' necrobiology are a bit different - prosthetics normally involve securely attaching the new part and kickstarting the healing, preferably continuing healing treatments every few days (too much or unskilled healing can result in tumors or other issues arising, such as numbness or lack of use), and then tending it for infection throughout the months-long healing process.

Full necrobiology takes a lot more magical energy. Generally, one starts with a 'base' - something preferably living or freshly killed, and swapping or adding a few parts with as much speed as possible, before 'kickstarting' the creature back to life. Many will heal much more than one normally would with a human was, especially the first time. Afterwards, you continue this process over time, adding more and letting heal. Near always the 'base' will contain at the very least internal organs and a brainstem, or other means for the creature to gain energy and continue living, so you don't have to fuel it yourself 24/7 or otherwise dump massive amounts of magic into it."

RealLifeShinies,fdtkxmq,t1_fdqzwjr,1578718253.0,"Albinism is the lack of the pigment Melanin - this pigment makes the varying shades of brown you see in mammals.

However, non-mammals have more than simply that one type of pigment. Because of this, it is harder to identify albino nonmammals. Ball pythons, for example, have a pigment that controls reds, and one that controls yellows. Because of this, an albino ball python will still have reds and yellows present - however, to my knowledge, an albino animal will aways have red eyes.

Leucism is the lacking or lightening of all pigments, and is often without full body coverage - when it's spotty it's often referred to as 'piebald'. However, a leucistic mammal can still be fully white without being albino - the main way to tell is the eyes. Leucistic animals will generally have blue eyes, as opposed to red.

Axanthic is the term used in the snake world to refer to snakes lacking their red or yellow pigments. Morphs of ball pythons are great ways to learn about various pigmentation 'conditions'.

Edit: I do believe you are right, though - I believe this is a leucistic turtle. The eyes are dark and blue-tinted, and there is no 'left over' pigments of other colors. This may also explain the colored streaks on the shell."

conlangs,fdczjkw,t3_ekm4oh,1578289057.0,"Gnille: They call their world 'Iundes' - 'Made By Iun'.

While other gods had created planets, so they say, none have yet been able to create life within them. 

In Alle, the 'common' language, the planet is either called Iundes (The above mythos is the leading one of the world), or the name for the planet in their specific language, which I've yet to develop. This is because Alle is a great pidgin, borrowing terms from most languages - as the speakers of Gnille were one of the first sapient races, and have intermingled throughout all of society, they lay claim to many 'basic' words of Alle."
