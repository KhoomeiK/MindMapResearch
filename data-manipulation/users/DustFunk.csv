Music,fegxhwl,t3_ep08s5,1579104728.0,I would love to hear more hip hop songs come out today with that super raw sound that all the Wu Tang and associate albums had. Over-polishing a track takes away from the raw nature of rap itself.
television,fegph7g,t3_eowu9q,1579099443.0,"As amazing as this is, I have no idea why they made the dialogue so fucking weird here, when Ezra is pondering ""The Flash"" moniker, and Grant says ""it's complicated"" what the hell is he talking about? How is the name ""The Flash"" something that's complicated and apparently problematic, the way Grant deliver's the line. It makes me think they edited together a bunch of lines that the two actors had performed into this meeting, but it just doesn't flow well.."

LifeProTips,feamrmp,t1_fe8seb1,1578950377.0,"for any given degree you need a structured approach to educating yourself towards mastery, it's difficult to just blindly search around for individual topics within that field and bring your understanding towards an all-inclusive point where you could be considered degree-level. Now the fundamental necessity for degrees in our world.....that's a whole other topic of conversation"
LifeProTips,fealo2d,t3_eo5nsq,1578950146.0,"If this isn't common knowledge by now with all college students, then I'm worried for those for whom it is not. I went back to college in my late 20's into mid thirties and I rely on youtube lectures for all my math related subjects (electronics engineering). If you're need of help on anything from trig to higher level differentials, there are so many channels that produce so many examples on a specific math, notable ones for me are: PatrickJMT, The Organic Chemistry Tutor (gives a large number of examples), Kahn Academy obviously, NancyPi, and Professor Leonard is great, I like his approach on some things."

television,fdribas,t1_fdr3rd2,1578684938.0,"I think one of the main things you missed is the absolute genius comedic delivery by so many people in the show but especially Donald Glover and Danny Pudi, they are the glue. The animated christmas episode is my all-time favorite episode"
television,fdqtnso,t3_emh1yy,1578674639.0,"So many people harping on ""trivia"" knowledge versus more useful information but what they are failing to consider is that trivia knowledge contains oral history of human culture and events. Knowing trivia is useful in generating conversations, formulating relationships and helps people to network by finding common interests. Having a vast knowledge of trivia facts could raise the potentiality of any one of those facts benefiting a person in some unknown way, similar to knowing how to tie a large number of knots could potentially benefit a sailor in different ways, or owning a vast array of hand or power tools in case the need for a particular function should arrive. The benefits of knowing ANYTHING far outweigh the benefits of the opposite, save for painful memories, or things of that nature. If more people knew more trivia about other people and cultures, there might just be more understanding and tolerance in the world. Trivia is history, and history should never be ignored."
