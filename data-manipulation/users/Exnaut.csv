todayilearned,ffjmo07,t1_ffjlusy,1580001777.0,"Jesus Christ someone needs to chill tf out. If you'd to compare a game done in NK and one in USA where towards the end of the match and the scores are like 80-100. If a team had the chance to get 8 points per shot. It would just make the game more intense, why wouldn't that be enjoyable? It doesn't make everything that happened before pointless or anything.
Edit: so. Yeah. I don't see why ignorance in basketball would have anything to do with this. I played it for 7 years and followed professional bball for a bit too and these rules look pretty fun"
todayilearned,ffjmlo1,t1_ffjmbuj,1580001733.0,"Not completely. There's still a strategy to what the team would need to do. And the last 3 minutes would play a big part of that consideration. It just simply makes it more exciting. Like looking at car racing video games with a catch up mechanic. With it, even if someone from last ends up winning. It doesn't completely make it pointless all before. You just have to play smart. Yeah it can be bs, but like I said. It makes it more exciting not knowing what may end up happening."
todayilearned,ffjkhs3,t1_ffio42f,1580000298.0,"In what way? It would be far more exciting, especially the last 3 minute one. You don't know wtf is going to happen and who will win even if there's a big lead. Plus, more ppl will go for dunks due to the extra point.

Playing the sport may be annoying tho. Watching? Nah, that would be pretty fun"

Even past prime ministers have made open comments on how insane and stupid he's being. Plus what his party has been bringing in and trying to do.

unpopularopinion,ffg35fd,t1_ffg2tq1,1579897445.0,"....can you not read anything? Schizophrenia and gender dysphoria are pretty different in their own ways. As I've already mentioned again, in the mental health industry, transitioning is the only way as we know so far to deal with gender dysphoria. That's it. And really? Having to change pronoun and name is hardly giving any effort at all. Plus is hardly giving more attention than your normal person. You're just changing a name and pronoun. If someone decided one day to legally change their name not related to being trans, you'd still be too stubborn to do anything? You have to be a troll, or just incredibly dumb"

unpopularopinion,ffg16og,t1_ffeyv4e,1579896229.0,"Well. One, it would just make it easier for everyone including yourself. If you had a colleague, you would just be fucking yourself over by not saying their chosen name or anything and just make the workplace shit. Plus, as I said. It actually helps them. And since humans are one of the most social species on the planet, helping those within your community also helps you. If you knew someone with depression, anxiety, ptsd, ocd, etc. you wouldn't just go out of your way to fuck them over. So why is it so hard to simply say a different name or pronoun? Would have to be one of the most entitled shit heads out there"
unpopularopinion,ffg0lru,t1_ffezoes,1579895874.0,Yeah no body is forced. But by that point you're just being a dick for no reason and causing someone's gender dysphoria to become worse. Like you wouldn't just trigger someone's ptsd
unpopularopinion,ffg0euo,t1_fffxxai,1579895756.0,Why u asking me? Ask the transphobic ppl who seem to treat it as such a big deal
UpliftingNews,ffeq7fp,t1_ffepoz7,1579860017.0,"Damn, that last point is something I've been thinking about for a while. Like it makes sense, we're one of the most social animals in the world. So maintaining romantic / sexual relationships could easily benefit. Even the Greeks I'm pretty sure tried to push homosexual relationships in their armies.

UpliftingNews,ffehzo9,t1_ffdltmr,1579848773.0,"Well gender dysphoria is a thing. And dealing with said gender dysphoria, is to transition."

unpopularopinion,ffeh3yc,t1_ffeawzi,1579847769.0,"Might be so high because of all the transphobic shit heads. It's pretty common knowledge in the mental health industry, allowing those to transition does help with gender dysphoria. Plus, using chosen pronouns and names decreases depression and suicidal tendencies

Edit: would really love to hear a counter argument. Because, these are based off of legit studies and facts"
unpopularopinion,ffegpj4,t1_ffe1811,1579847330.0,"Well.... Yes a lot of ppl care. That's why ppl still try to fight for trans rights. It's very easy to see ppl are pretty transphobic. And it's not a new term or anything just seen past couple years. Started back in the 1990s. Plus, why does it matter? It's just an easier way to label ppl, idk if you've noticed but especially in the English language. We love to label everything"

australia,ffeec0m,t1_ffe9923,1579844841.0,"Well, the whole ""public holiday"" thing started in 1994. But the whole Australia day being celebrated on that day and being a serious thing. Has been done since early 1900's. So I wouldn't really say it's that new of a thing"
australia,ffedjuu,t1_ffecd83,1579844072.0,"That's possibly the best reccomendation I've seen yet tbh. There's not a lot of good dates we can really do due to one reason or another. But that seems to mix well. Plus, we don't really have many national holidays during the year. So that kinda fills that up too."
australia,ffe8mtp,t1_ffe7ui7,1579839700.0,Is it normally pretty bad? I wasn't here last year so I kinda missed it. So far it seems kinda fine. Just ppl throwing ideas out on what day it could be if it would to change.
justneckbeardthings,ffdb2qv,t1_ffclbzm,1579817031.0,"Well I guess? The point of the show is to make you rethink about a certain topic and just look into it more yourself if you wish to. Sometimes they're wrong and it is oversimplified of course. Nobody is perfect. But most of the time when I personally looked into it, they are right to a degree"
todayilearned,ffd5qiv,t1_ffd55af,1579813943.0,"Yeah it was different. But it was already pretty damn clear by this point in time sexualizing teens is pretty pedophilic (or if you want to be more specific ""hebephilic""/""ephebophilic"") and just something you shouldn't do."
todayilearned,ffd4ay7,t1_ffd2em7,1579813146.0,"Really? At most they're like 15 years old. It's not that long ago, and it's not hard to think that sexualizing teens, is a big no no. Boku no hero academia started in 2014 but has plenty of sexual shit. Food wars started in 2012 and that has a ton, yeah a good amount of it is comedy oriented but still doesn't shy away from sexualizing them pointlessly over the top.

Although, I will agree looking into it, as you said in recent years by their creation of conception. It does appear to be decreasing slightly over time. Most seem to be around 2000-2010."
todayilearned,ffd2at6,t1_ffcx1x0,1579812013.0,"Yeah, most anime doesn't have it but it's still incredibly normalised in it. Like in gurren laggan with Yoko, she pretty much has the body of a young adult wearing practically nothing with the other male characters constantly being interested in her and she's shown to kinda like the attention. But she's 14 years old. And this stuff is done in other relatively popular, mainstream anime like with Lucy in fairy tail who's 17, Elizabeth in 7 deadly sins who's 16. Even has a bit with asuna in sao who deals with sexual stuff ranging from ages 15-17."

PublicFreakout,ffagboj,t1_ffa8wv3,1579735085.0,"Well it's kinda partly better if there's no harm behind it. But that's different because there's more agressive history behind the word ""abo"" specifically. Like queer and ""fa***t"" are somewhat in the same field. But the f word has far more to it than queer does. So obviously it wouldn't be used as much in a neutral/friendly context. So comparing wog to abo isn't exactly the best."
PublicFreakout,ffafl7m,t1_ff93kwa,1579734589.0,"In Australia it can be compared to ppl saying ""queer"". Some ppl feel offended by it and some use it specifically to offend. While plenty use it to self-describe and use it casually. Mainly a word that depends largely on intent."
PublicFreakout,ffadt1f,t1_ffabe80,1579733215.0,"Since we're close to Asia. We get a lot of southern and eastern Asian especially Indian. So you do get a fair bit against those groups. My parents are a bit like that too. We also have a fair amount of Lebanese which also get quite a few comments. Black people here though aren't very common so you don't hear much to do with them.

unpopularopinion,ff3vgb7,t1_ff2zmso,1579549723.0,"Except no? My career choice is social work which is literally based around helping strangers. But your very basic view of people is honestly quite disturbing. Especially on the fact you seem to treat it that we can get replaced so easily. 
Emotionally it's understandable someone would save their pet first before a stranger, I'm sure many would including myself. But logically speaking, it's pretty selfish and damn dumb especially your incredibly simplified view on it. Because on probability, the person would most likely live longer, they'll be able to benefit the community which in turn would benefit you, if the person would to die, fat more people would be negatively affected by it especially compared to an animal.

If I was a firefighter and your house was burning, I'd choose you over your cat because that's what normal genuine people do.

Sometimes they're wrong and it is oversimplified of course. Nobody is perfect. But most of the time when I personally looked into it, they are right to a degree"
todayilearned,ffd5qiv,t1_ffd55af,1579813943.0,"Yeah it was different. But it was already pretty damn clear by this point in time sexualizing teens is pretty pedophilic (or if you want to be more specific ""hebephilic""/""ephebophilic"") and just something you shouldn't do."
todayilearned,ffd4ay7,t1_ffd2em7,1579813146.0,"Really? At most they're like 15 years old. It's not that long ago, and it's not hard to think that sexualizing teens, is a big no no. Boku no hero academia started in 2014 but has plenty of sexual shit. Food wars started in 2012 and that has a ton, yeah a good amount of it is comedy oriented but still doesn't shy away from sexualizing them pointlessly over the top.

Although, I will agree looking into it, as you said in recent years by their creation of conception. It does appear to be decreasing slightly over time. Most seem to be around 2000-2010."
todayilearned,ffd2at6,t1_ffcx1x0,1579812013.0,"Yeah, most anime doesn't have it but it's still incredibly normalised in it. Like in gurren laggan with Yoko, she pretty much has the body of a young adult wearing practically nothing with the other male characters constantly being interested in her and she's shown to kinda like the attention. But she's 14 years old. And this stuff is done in other relatively popular, mainstream anime like with Lucy in fairy tail who's 17, Elizabeth in 7 deadly sins who's 16. Even has a bit with asuna in sao who deals with sexual stuff ranging from ages 15-17."

PublicFreakout,ffagboj,t1_ffa8wv3,1579735085.0,"Well it's kinda partly better if there's no harm behind it. But that's different because there's more agressive history behind the word ""abo"" specifically. Like queer and ""fa***t"" are somewhat in the same field. But the f word has far more to it than queer does. So obviously it wouldn't be used as much in a neutral/friendly context. So comparing wog to abo isn't exactly the best."
PublicFreakout,ffafl7m,t1_ff93kwa,1579734589.0,"In Australia it can be compared to ppl saying ""queer"". Some ppl feel offended by it and some use it specifically to offend. While plenty use it to self-describe and use it casually. Mainly a word that depends largely on intent."

Emotionally it's understandable someone would save their pet first before a stranger, I'm sure many would including myself.

Because on probability, the person would most likely live longer, they'll be able to benefit the community which in turn would benefit you, if the person would to die, fat more people would be negatively affected by it especially compared to an animal.

If I was a firefighter and your house was burning, I'd choose you over your cat because that's what normal genuine people do.

I can't tell if you're trolling or you're just outright brainwashed by this point. Mind you, black Saturday happened towards the end of fire season. Yet everything we've had so far has mostly been pre fire season and it has started all the way back in September.
