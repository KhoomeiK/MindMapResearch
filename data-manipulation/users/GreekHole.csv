> Don't all shows do these in some form or another?

Lots of show has the themed episodes yes, cause they're all the same type of show. 22ish episodes stretched out over a year, ending and starting the same each season.

It depends on the network for one. And basically every CW shows is like it i guess. The themed episodes are not inherently bad, but it's mostly just a gimmicky filler episode, and they all end up feeling the same each year. 

My problem with keeping the shows happening mostly in real time, is that it doesn't really make sense. Each season on each show, something bad happens at the end of summer. and they save the city or whatever right before the next summer starts. 

most episodes actually happens on the day they air. and they even mention this on the shows. often by making a joke about ""why is it always Tuesdays?"" or an exposition line about ""x bad guy hasn't made a move in a week"". 

some episodes take place over multiple days, and some episodes do happen right after one another. But there are still all these gaps during the year where *nothing* happens."

This is pretty much the case. Pretty much all CW shows have these holiday themed episodes. (becasue all the shows happen in real time, which is stupid, but another topic)
