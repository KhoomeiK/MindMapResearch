All jokes aside? Don't do this. Go to bed. If you don't fall asleep within 20 minutes, get up out of bed and go somewhere else till you feel drowsy. Then go to bed. Repeat.

If you lie in bed freaking out, you're training your body to think of bed as 'that place where I freak out'. Freak out somewhere else.
