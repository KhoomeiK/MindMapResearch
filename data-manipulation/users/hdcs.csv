FWIW, my husband also sticks to higher end accomodations that cater to western business people and he only gets his bottled water from those hotels. It helps that his company is paying! He's taken other co-workers who were first time international travelers who have followed the same guidelines with similar results of staying healthy.

Fried, bolied, well baked foods and bottled water are your friends. Watch out for items topped with raw chopped onions, cilantro, or nuts. My other half goes to India 3-4 times a year and this has served him well. He got wicked nasty DelhiBelly three or four years ago on a BLR trip after falling to guilt on eating home cooked, home grown veg from a well meaning co-worker.
