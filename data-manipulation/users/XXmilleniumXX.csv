I’m autistic. I’m super open here, but it’s a secret from a lot of people in my life because they start treating me really weirdly. Also, I sound much more articulate and have far less, if any, tells via text. 

I’m transgender. None of you can say “but you look like a girl, imma call you a girl” because when I say I’m a man, you picture me as a vague stick figure man and it never occurs to you to act as though I’m female.

I’m depressed. Keeping up relationships and finding the energy to converse with real people is kind of hard, but I’ve always felt welcome here, and I can jump onto whatever subreddit I want whenever I want. Sometimes I get support from complete strangers, and if I’m lounging around in pajamas all day, not only do you not care, but most of you are probably doing it too. 

When I crack a joke, I love seeing the upvotes creep up and knowing that I made hundreds of people who could be anyone, anywhere, laugh or smile today. Maybe the guy next to me on the bus heard what I had to say about the everlasting guinea pig cycle, or a man in Madagascar read about all the snow we have here and can’t wait to see it.

It doesn't directly relate to the road widening in general. The parts from S 7th through Washtenaw run pretty smoothly, and you're not seeing a lot of traffic around where you live because that's the beginning of the residential area as opposed to downtown, where 4/5ths of Huron St. (and the congested part) is.
