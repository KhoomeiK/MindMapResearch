US has a D rating in public infrastructure. And the quality of healthcare might be good,but what’s it matter if you’re going to chafe under debt for the rest of your life to access it. Functionally,there’s little difference between healthcare being shit and an individual being barred from accessing due to finances. In both cases,the individual doesn’t receive the care they need.

You have a lot of assumptions that are just counter-factual. You have an idealized version of the United States in your head that contradicts your idea of a 3rd world country.

It’s about reorganizing society along utilitarian lines so that the class of leaches,exploiters,and capitalists simply does not exist. It’s about minimizing what you believe is human nature. You’re literally taking the middle school teacher argument of “Marx didn’t think of human nature.” But tidying it up with nicer vocabulary. Have you ever bothered to wonder,if human nature is so greedy,toxic,and unchanging,why do we operate under a system that feeds off of it? Wouldn’t it be smarter to create a system that isn’t entirely based off of the shittiest parts of human nature? You know,socialism."

1. Probably getting a fat check towards his re-election campaign + some promise of “more jobs” from the school food suppliers.
2. Making parents more financially desperate since school food expenditures now have to be accounted for. Yeah,it’s like $2.50 a day,but that adds up very quickly for people who make minimum wage and already have to pay other bills. This in itself is an example of capital distracting the worker so they can’t possibly organize,or sometimes even vote. You can’t make it to the polls because you’re working 60+ hours a week to feed your kid at school. You can’t possibly unionize because if you lose your job you and your child will starve.

It’s a “I can be critical of their theocratic system but still not want a massive imperialist war for profit that will inevitably revolve into an asymmetrical guerilla war with no foreseeable end.” Political views are on a spectrum,they’re not polar.

Anyway, some bourgeoisie Tex-Mex place moves in nearby and starts complaining incessantly that the homeless are driving away customers,killing their business,etc. They get the city involved and cops come out to force homeless people away and enforce these shitty regulations on the soup kitchen.
