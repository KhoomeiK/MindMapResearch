It’s a hard pill to swallow for the US given how things work, but I shit you not, if other countries start to do this, with new contracts and legit prints, DoD will need to reactively adapt, in other words, US needs military/civilian regulations for 3D print ASAP, imho, in 2024 all armies are gonna have 3D printers installed in drones and autonomous vehicles to provide maintenance support, like drones printing drone parts and all that shit, so I expect to see the US being a first mover here, because late bloomers are gonna just pay licenses, same way as today."

The army should have the option to do these, contractors should swallow it."
