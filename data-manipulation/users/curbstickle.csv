Here's what you're going to see - and it's all based on reasonable expectation of privacy.

Some states say you can put a camera in places of you explicitly and visibly denote that a camera is present - which removes the reasonable expectation of privacy as it is clear you will have none.

In absolutely zero cases, in any state, can you record in a place where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.

Perhaps you misunderstood the states where they can post a sign.  That's ok.  But you aren't correct.
