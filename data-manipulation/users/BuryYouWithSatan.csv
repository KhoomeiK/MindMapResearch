Better is relevant to the instrument / measure. Which in this case is carbon emissions. If I have a lower carbon and ecological footprint than somebody else, I am better in this regard. If those people insist I must stop eating meat to lower my footprint, nothing has changed, I am still better and they are still worse according to the measure.
