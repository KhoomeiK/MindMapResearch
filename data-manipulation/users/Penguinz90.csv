Coronavirus,ffm5l8i,t1_ffm36rm,1580048824.0,"There is absolutely no way anyone on here can answer that for you, especially since the symptoms are just like that if a cold/flu.  If you are worried talk to your parents, tell them what you told us and let them decide if you should be seen or not."

Coronavirus,ffkq50g,t1_ffkp76s,1580026937.0,Where did you see that this was confirmed?  Such scary shit!
Coronavirus,ffkpfey,t3_eu41nf,1580026597.0,"But a 2nd mutation does not necessarily mean it is more deadly...just that it has a component in it that has changed.  

I would be careful about just telling people it is now  deadly, I mean obviously the first mutation was/is deadly just like the flu is.  Yes, the elderly, sick and very young are at higher risk or it being deadly, but saying the 2nd mutation is deadly makes it sound as if you are afflicted with this new mutation you will die, which will lead to panic for sure.  I just pray that isn't exactly what he meant by it.

Scary shit regardless."

Botchedsurgeries,ff4yp9q,t3_ern86r,1579575649.0,"WHY????  Like seriously....WHY????  Do men truly find this hot?  My husband has commented that for him one of the things he likes about breasts is feeing the soft curves.  He looked at this photo and said it would be like caressing watermelons...no appeal.  

They look terrible, her skin is tight and stretched thin, and she will probably have to have some sort of corrective surgery every few years as I can only imagine scar tissue will encapsulate around the implants making them look even worse, or they may get leaks in them or flat out burst."
