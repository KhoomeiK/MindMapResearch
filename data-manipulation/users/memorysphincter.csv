aww,ffkhzmi,t1_ffk5ykq,1580023072.0,It stands for 'Today Diddly I Learned'. A classic Ned Flanderism.
CrappyDesign,ffip32f,t1_ffintnq,1579979195.0,Oh no I've spoiled your lunch. Haven't fridged enough.
TrollXChromosomes,ffgbqdz,t1_fffukqv,1579902728.0,"Say whaaaaat???! That's some olympic level mental gymnastics ya gotta do there! Fuck, i loved Sansa's and Arya's story arcs the most out of the series. Disliked both in the beginning - Sansa cause she was pretty spoiled and princess obsessed - but as soon as Ned Stark got executed, they both changed dramatically and their story lines ramped up so well. Sansa basically went from being a pawn to a mother fuckin queen on that big ole chess board we call westeros.

I could also just watch an entire spin off series that's just Arya going off on that ship of hers, a bad ass pirate queen, exploring, looting, getting into big ole monster of the week type episodes, like Jason and the Argonauts kinda epic adventures. And maybe have some cameos from other characters who didn't die in the last season (is Brianne still alive? I forget)."

TrollXChromosomes,ff9imrb,t1_ff9dh38,1579713811.0,"Ha ha! I thought the same thing! Maybe this carbon copy esthetic is some new filter the kids are into? Sepia makes things look 'old timey', but now this new photocopy style is the new retro style, I'm assuming. God this makes me feel old."
TrollXChromosomes,ff9id1i,t3_esd1gt,1579713650.0,"I like that this tweet looks like someone printed it out, then brought it into the office to photocopy it, then took a pic of it to upload onto the internets. Feels like something my mom would do :)"
TrollXChromosomes,ff6084i,t1_ff5qys0,1579615754.0,"Huh. Til I have this. I do absolutely nothing though. Just kinda leave it as is, but now thanks to you, I not only have a new sub, but hopefully I'll find some helpful advice! Thanks internet stranger!"
Wellthatsucks,feptu0v,t1_feowirr,1579331067.0,"Doesn't even have to relate to sexuality. You literally have access to a dick, 24/7. As do all biological men. :)"
aww,fepkela,t3_eqbxy9,1579322795.0,The fuck??
Perfectfit,feo27xd,t1_feo1jfm,1579294142.0,Exactly!

TrollXChromosomes,feng00e,t1_fenfrge,1579283878.0,Correct. Memorysphincter is my family name. My full Christian name is 'Whorevius Memorysphincter'
TrollXChromosomes,fenb67s,t1_fen8xh0,1579280929.0,"I have to blame the parents on this one. Grima Wormtongue? Grima Wormtongue??! This is the name you go with? Basically his while life he was told how creepy his name is, it's no wonder he became such a slithering sleazebag as an adult. Now, if they'd called him Chad Wormtongue, I dare say he would have turned out much different."
TrollXChromosomes,fekn1dj,t1_fek0qge,1579203452.0,"Sweet! Love your art style! Keep them jems coming, pretty please!"
television,feklmcn,t1_fekj3dw,1579202603.0,"I like to think of it as part of an alternate reality trek, same with the j.j. abrams movies. I adore the earlier era stuff that i grew up with (tng, ds9, voy) but appreciate this new series as its own thing. Still related to trek, but existing in its own space time continuum.

Also: if John De Lancie doesn't make AT LEAST a cameo in the new Picard series, I'ma flip a table right over!"
television,fekiox7,t1_feki2sh,1579200861.0,The second season of Discovery has Captain Pike and Spock in it.
