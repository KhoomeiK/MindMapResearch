As somebody who attends an university with a handful of “electronic free zone” courses, I strongly disagree. If there’s a paper version of the book, it’s not an unreasonable request. Depending on the class, they may teach off powerpoints and that is all you need; there is no need to be reading the book during class. 

Escalating this to the department head is a waste of OP and the heads time. This is a decision made by the professor for their classroom, which the department head would most likely agree with."

Life after high school is depressing.

Yea, i’ll be honest. this has more to do with your lack of time management skills and less about life in general. Work is 40hrs a week or school. Learn how to study effectively, manage your time, and you’ll suddenly have more time to do all the fun things you want to."
AmItheAsshole,fdldu9y,t1_fdld491,1578521900.0,"The thermostat is in the common hallway for anyone to adjust and I’m quite positive we all have adjusted it +/- depending on our own needs or who’s home at the time. The only time it was an issue is when the roommate who lives downstairs next to the furnace room said it was “hot as fuck” downstairs when we had it up on 80. Other than that, we have had no issues with being too hot, too cold. We all acknowledge we are more liberal with electricity and heat since we’re not billed for it. 

Other than that, we all usually keep our doors closed so the only way I’m causing issues to my roommates is by possibly triggering the heat on and off more than usual."

When you turned 18 and went to the DMV to get your new license, you already signed up to possibly be drafted. This is nothing new."
college,fcvddis,t1_fcuy8iv,1577999746.0,Whether it’s actually necessary to understand to program or not doesn’t change the fact that OP’s school requires a passing C and he failed with a D. This is an irrelevant argument to be having in this thread.

You haven’t even attended a single lecture yet, so I’m not sure what this type of email would accomplish. Show up on the first day, sit up front, and introduce yourself after class or in his office hours and have a polite conversation about the class and what type of goals you have set out for their course. As much as it’s nice to become buddy-buddy with your professors, sending a shorthand email before the class even starts accomplishes nothing, honestly. Just wait until you actually attend one lecture."
