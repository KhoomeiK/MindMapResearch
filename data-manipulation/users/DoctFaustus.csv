news,fgti3o3,t1_fgtgs51,1581104788.0,The guy had a BAC of over 0.4.  You don't reach that unless you're a hardcore alcoholic.  I've worked with a few guys in that territory.  Everyone in the department knew he was a drunk before they found him passed out on the job.  A guy like that is drunk every day.  They knew exactly what they were doing when they swept this under the rug.  My bet is it was one of the firefighters that tipped off the press to the incident.  There is no reason the chief should skate on this.

skiing,fgqyy5t,t1_fgqxyxx,1581034484.0,"Both safety and function.  You're not worried about them breaking.  They simply won't even attach to your boots unless they are properly adjusted.  And if they just happen to fit without adjustment, it wouldn't be safe to ski them without adjustment.  So yes, it is 100% needed."
skiing,fgqylmg,t1_fgqxum2,1581034265.0,"The bindings will need to be adjusted to fit your boots.  Rental skis have special bindings that have a wider range of adjustment.  But they can still be moved.  But unless you're buying the skis, bindings, and boots as a used set you'll need to take them to a shop to adjust them to fit your boots.  If that isn't done, you probably won't even be able to step in to the bindings.  And you certainly can't trust them to be adjusted to come free at the right setting.  
  
This is a good thread to find out if they are still on the list.  If you call a local shop, tell them the model of binding and they can check it against the list.  Just ask if they are still indemnified, they'll know what that means.  Once a binding gets too old, the manufacturers will drop it from their indemnification list.  Because springs and plastic degrade and they can no longer certify them as safe.  The shop will have a current list."
skiing,fgqxb5a,t1_fgqkah2,1581033450.0,"You're right, it'd be fine for a beginner.  The only question is whether or not the bindings are still indemnified.  If they have dropped off the supported list, you could have trouble finding a shop to work on them.  They look like they're from around 2008, so it's borderline.  Someone on here may have a current list and can check.  Otherwise, give a local shop a call and ask them to check their list."

Denver,fgq9hb0,t1_fgq93qp,1581020360.0,Exactly.  We can't blame the DA here.  The police knew what they were doing when they simply failed to collect any evidence of the crime.  That's where the problem lies.
Denver,fgq7e89,t1_fgq14w1,1581019252.0,"The officers at the scene knew what they were doing when they neglected to follow standard process for gathering evidence for a DUI.  They were sweeping it under the rug, and they did it with the full knowledge of the top brass of the department.  Every single officer at the scene, and every commanding officer in the chain that knew about it, are complicit in covering up this fellow officer's crimes.  But, that doesn't mean it's the DA's fault.  It's not.  This rests squarely of the department itself."

I made frequent two to three day business trips, so it made sense for me.  The only one I had that I thought was worth its salt was the PetSafe Simply Clean.  There are a few reasons for this.  First, you can use plastic grocery bags for the used litter receptacle.  Many require you to buy expensive proprietary plastic trays.  Second, it rotates continuously.   Rather than make a huge racket sweeping after it detected the cat.  It only rotates once an hour, so it slow enough the cat won't notice.  I found the mechanism to be pretty reliable.  Not something I could say for the typical style like the LitterMaid that sweeps through with a comb.  I did find the applying a little spray oil like PAM made sure litter didn't get stuck to the container.  It's also very finicky about maintaining the correct level of litter in the container.  But you have about half an inch of wiggle room, so it's not hard to hit the mark."
