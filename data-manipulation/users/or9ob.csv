personalfinance,fdqu8k4,t1_fdqozxg,1578674981.0,"Pet insurance will pay nothing for anything other than big emergencies, you are right. 

So we basically pay about $35-$50/month. If nothing happens, it’s all going to the company. 

However, if there is an emergency that’s when it makes it possible to not have to put down your buddy (think ACL, Cancer etc). 

I have personally tried Healthy Paws and TruPanion and loved the care that they provide."
