iamverysmart,fgn2wwa,t3_ez19o4,1580936668.0,Really depends on the context whether or not this is r/iamverysmart worthy. If it was in response to someone insulting/accusing him then this seems perfectly reasonable.

justlegbeardthings,fgh3e7h,t1_fggi1vo,1580775747.0,"They literally use ""black kids get less time to study because they get expelled from school more, therefore time is racist"" as an argument. My dude, you don't get expelled from school *just* for being black.... This has nothing to do with racism.

I'm fully aware that black people are at a disadvantage in the West because of historical reasons, and we should definitely try to fix that. But that doesn't mean you magically don't have any personal responsibility whatsoever, and that anything that ever happens to you is because of 'racism'."
