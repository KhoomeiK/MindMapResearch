I recognize that Harry was a 12 year old kid when the wand broke, and that Hogwarts as a whole should probably have done something to see about getting Ron a wand that wasn't a danger to himself and others. I think that's rather my point. They could literally have had a teacher take Ron to Diagon Alley to get a new wand during second year. Especially after the incident with the slugs. Schools generally have a fund for things like that, which begs the question of how Hogwarts makes money. 

Is it a private Wizarding Institution, where students parents pay for them to go, or is it a public school funded by Wizard Taxes through the MoM? 

Hell, you're telling me the school provided brooms for flying lessons, but couldn't be bothered to provide a wand for a student who was shooting off awry spells left right and center?"

technology,ff6gff3,t1_ff65sar,1579626647.0,"Yeah but what you earn in game is entirely aesthetic and means basically nothing. There are no boosts to make your character better or make you a better player. It's not a pay to win scenario. And you don't ever have to spend money on the loot boxes involved. Playing the game always drops them (pretty much) and after that it's up to you whether you even open them or not. 

The only problem with them in my opinion is that they're available to be bought with real money (or that currency for them in the game can be bought with real money). 

That being said I would agree that though they are valueless, they may unfortunately appeal to a sense of competition between younger players to get certain skins etc.

And the thing about that is, parents really should be finding out about the games their kids play and in general curbing that behavior and making things like paid loot boxes unavailable. We've got 3 switches and 2 PS4's in our home and my kid is 11. He isn't allowed to play certain games, and has no access to buy anything from any games. On the rare occasion that he wants something (say the SSBU Pirahna Plant) he has to ask and I or my husband have to approve it. I've never bought a loot box but my father is a gambler."

I agree that they have changed the settings around quite a bit which is a boon to new users maybe but detrimentally effects older users. 

They definitely broke some of the functionality of casting music when they made it device specific so that you could no longer specify which devices you wanted it to use by default, and instead used the device you used to trigger the action by default.

todayilearned,ff3762c,t1_ff36xhn,1579535304.0,"Lol. And then you went and tried to make my argument look ridiculous by deliberately skewing percentages in your favor and completely ignoring far reaching extenuating circumstances that can be both extrapolated from what I said and further researched because you have a narrative and a world view that you want to hang onto.


Edit: So your argument is that by the 1980's 70% of households (not black households just all households in the US) were single parent, and that the crack epidemic had nothing to do with that. 

But not because, in fact, the crack epidemic didn't start until the 80's. Which actually would have been a good point, but also would have required you to clarify that you meant there was an increase in single parent households from the 1960's to the 1980's which culminated (in the 80's) in a rate of single parent households for all races being 70% which wouldn't have helped your narrative about black people taking advantage of expanded welfare.

Edit:  Focusing on just the crack epidemic, or even the war on drugs doesn't account for those two decades and what was happening during them that did infact lead to such a rate of both disadvantaged black people, and the increase in single parent households in the black community.

In today's numbers, 68% of families with children under the age of 18 are married couples.

You didn't take into account things like the rise in divorces during this time frame, nor did you even try to tackle the whole teen pregnancy epidemic, the AIDS crisis (1980's) and sexual education during the time (1960-1990), and how those things changed the landscape."

There were many things that happened between those two events that influenced the black community and it's ability to have and maintain two parent households. 

The first welfare system was enacted by Roosevelt in the 1930's. Welfare was then expanded in the 1960's in order to make it available to blacks. 30 years later. 

So by your narrative there should be a whole subset of the white population (who got welfare first) who are single parent households. Which is bogus and sounds ridiculous because it is. 

The other things that happened played a role and ignoring them to further the narrative that the ""welfare state"" is the cause of the rise of single parent households in the black community is cheap and doesn't make any sense when you know the history and further when you know the statistics of white people who take illegal advantage of social programs vs black people who do the same."

todayilearned,ff341ix,t1_ff1v4wj,1579533132.0,"Which is a direct result of, the incarceration rate, the crack epidemic and the subsequent war on drugs, and things like Soul City. 

Basically, the rate of marriage in the black community in say the 1950's was pretty much the same as that of marriage in the white community. And then the black family unit was ravaged by the institutionalized racism of the crack epidemic and the war on drugs which followed in the 1980's and 1990's. 

Before that black people still suffering under Jim Crow and the Reconstruction wanted to leave the city and create black communities because they couldn't move into white communities. The dream of the black community came to fruition under Nixon in the form of Soul City and it died under Nixon without ever being fully realized, basically taxes out of existence after all the funding promised was pulled in the 1970's.

The crack epidemic happened (and was taken advantage of by the federal government in order to criminalize crack in a way that other drugs (used by the white subset of the populace) weren't which lead to significantly increased incarceration rates in the black subset of the populace.

""Nacho Notch, a third-party app on the Google Play Store, was specifically built to make notches a little more bearable for those who can’t stand them. It hides the notch, but it also makes sure the display real estate around the notch doesn’t go to waste. Unlike the built-in Android method, Nacho Notch leaves the status bar on the sides of the notch. That means your notification icons and system tray information stay around the notch at the top, but you still get black bars that mask the look. It’s an elegant solution.

Nacho Notch allows you to quickly toggle the feature on and off because it’s a quick settings tile in the notification drawer. You can even set the app to round the corners on the display, making it look a lot more natural on a device like the Google Pixel 3 XL. There is one downside here — the feature doesn’t work on the lock screen, so you won’t be able to hide the notch there."" - Digital Tends"

And that non unionized employees are lacking in those protections and therefore get paid less and have less in benefits. 

I had the choice between a union job and a non union job not too long ago. I chose the non union job and am kicking myself over it because while the benefits package and pay were similar and I'd have to pay union dues, if I had taken that job I'd have had better holiday pay, more time off, better overtime pay, better weekend pay. Because the union advocated for small things over time that have big impact. I learned quickly that it's not just about pay. It's about perks. 

I'm capped out for what I can make in my position at my work. I can't move up to a higher level position unless someone else leaves or dies. Which means no pay increases. But with the other job I'd get pay increase every year. Things like that are. Important."
