AskReddit,ffd1jw7,t1_ffclc9t,1579811595.0,"The hypocrisy was absolutely amazing. Did I say amazing? I mean fucking horrifying. So my boss had hired his brother to be our office manager/initial HR manager and we all just thought he was fucking blitzed and hungover the whole time because he liked to play poker online all the time. One day he just stopped showing up and ""C"" said he had a medical emergency and had to step away. It later turned out that ""J"" had been doing H for awhile and stole one of his brother's cars from the underground garage and tried selling it for gambling/drug money. ""C"" lied for months about it to the rest of us but it finally came out one night when ""C"" was trashed and venting to a couple of us. Nepotism and hypocrisy at work in tandem."
Music,ffccdvv,t3_eshpmo,1579796414.0,"I really liked Danny, I grew up watching that 70's show and kind of idolized Hyde, and was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on one but 8 different women coming forward sets a clear pattern and it's really disappointing. Scientologists are just fucking crazy nutbags, When I first heard of them I thought they were a bunch of science focused people who organized under a religious banner to mock religion and then I found about Xenu and the batshit crazy bullshit they believe and the founders sex parties on boats with boys."

-Finish the product and get it working
-Don't make promises we can't keep just to get them to sign
-Don't fire the Dev Team
-Don't outsource work to your shitty friends
-Don't be a dick"

AskReddit,ffc8bkg,t1_ffbzipl,1579793846.0,"I was one of the first 13 hires and was promised more than other employees and I made sure to get it in writing. Boss would be our CEO, I was our IT department and helped manage the work between our on/off shore teams and worked with our vendors, I worked 12 hour days more often than not and put my heart and soul into the company which netted me the business operations manager title which was highly unusual for my field but I wasn't going to look a gift horse/raise in the mouth. As unusual as it was, I was able to leverage it at my new company to get significantly more money than I would have so some good things did come from that."
AskReddit,ffb6y3g,t1_ffafmxm,1579753448.0,"Reduction of Force. You basically state that you no longer need those roles so you're not firing them, you just don't need them. legally(in california at least) when you do that you can't rehire for those specific roles within a set amount of time. So if you do that to an entire department, you fuck yourself."

AskReddit,ffb6fkh,t1_ffau3wp,1579753045.0,"We offered a multi CDN solution in and out of china because one of our owners was a chinese national so we could do business across the great wall and not get kicked out. The chinese branch is still open last I checked, my boss just lied his ass off to our partners and completely blew our budget on the dumbest fucking shit and stupid pointless trips and got nothing done. He got into it with our dev team because they knew more than him and he had to be the smartest person in the room so he RoF'd the department and prevented us from being able to rehire for those roles for a year so we had to contract out the work to his friends who completely dicked us around and got fucking nothing done."
AskReddit,ffacfwu,t3_esi1iu,1579732263.0,"My startup went under, but here were the signs:  
\-The only work was busy body work assigned by bosses and not coming in from the queue  
\-We missed payroll one week. We asked when we were getting shut down, they said everything was fine.  
\-Bosses had locked door meetings for two weeks and were cunts to everyone during that time  
\-RoF(Reduction of Force) started two months after the first payroll miss.  
\-The company is now completely shuttered.

My bosses(CEO, CTO, HR Manager) were fucking idiots and had this wild ass plan of selling the company with no product or revenue. We tried pitching alternatives and driving revenue so that the company would succeed and we were talked down to at every opportunity and told we know nothing about sales or running a successful company."

I've never lost respect for someone so quick.

 I broke up with her that weekend, kept visiting Frank while he was in recovery and still see him once or twice a year."

In this case, I'm an IT Support Specialist with 15 years of experience. I wasn't fired, but I was refused raises and forced to find a new job. They would not fire anyone in the IT department because they didn't want to pay the benefits which resulted in a lot of shitty team members. After I secured a new job and left, I found out they had to hire three people to cover the scope of what I did across multiple sites in our region. I've kept in touch with people from that job, all 3 of the people who replaced my role at each site have also left and the roles are currently open. I'm now happy, with more money and better benefits at a new company. They never reached out or tried to rehire me at any point, despite multiple executives asking the company to try and re-approach me."

AskReddit,fcnwb4e,t3_ei21zo,1577819732.0,"Oh jesus christ. I was seeing this girl who's dad had gotten into a motorcycle accident. I had met him before the accident so I had a point of reference for his mental state and while having a lot of motor issues after the accident and requiring care, his sense of self was still there and he could communicate effectively if given the time, and he was steady on his way to recovery. I'm talking to her one day and she's going off about how much it impacts HER life and what a hassle it was and lord help me, the audacity of this girl, she says she wishes her dad had just died in the accident. To my knowledge, they had a perfect relationship before the accident, no signs of abuse, he always had her back and helped her through all of her bullshit with her mom and looking back, they were both crazy and this poor man had to go through life navigating the batshit crazy river stix of the two women in his life. But this blew my mind, My family has always had each others backs and always been there to help no matter what so to hear that come out of her mouth immediately destroyed my opinion of her and the fallout of the argument that followed ended the relationship."
