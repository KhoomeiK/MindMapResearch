What might help is to learn how real architecture works. You don't have to become an architect, just know what things like buttresses and vaults are, what they look like, and how they're used. Look up reference if you need it. You're basically just grabbing elements you like and putting them together. As long as you don't take too many from the same place, or put them together exactly the same way, you're fine. If you've ever tried kitbashing, it's like that.

The great thing is, you can apply this to almost anything creative.  Find phrases or analogies you like from countless different sources, and build up a library in your head. Tweak them to fit whatever you're writing. The important thing here is to keep some distance between wherever you found a certain element and your actual *sources*. If you're writing a research paper on Chernobyl, it's better to take a few words you read in an obscure novel 3 years ago, a simile you found in a tech forum last week, half of a sentence you heard in a space documentary, than it is to just paraphrase whole sections of a news article about the disaster.

 You don't have to create *everything* ex nihilo. The dirty little secret about plagiarism is how easy it is to get away with, once you've chopped tons and tons of source material into tiny, bite-size pieces, arranged them in a form that's completely unrecognizable, and glued them together with your own original content. At that point, it's not really even plagiarism anymore."
