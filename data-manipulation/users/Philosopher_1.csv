Even if they had 6 times the number of children, that’d still only represent like 12% of the population.  Still less births than white people.

unpopularopinion,fggber5,t1_fgg48df,1580758301.0,"Because part of American history relied heavily on blacks people but we never gave them credit then.  Slavery was used in almost every aspect of the southern economy, and our biggest cash crop for a century or two was cotton, farmed almost exclusively by slaves.  American history is basically white history so celebrating the others who helped us become such a prosperous nation is only right isn’t it?"
unpopularopinion,fggavwf,t1_fgg3scc,1580757983.0,Where in history class do you not learn about white people? All of American history dealt with white people except for the civil war and the civil rights movement.  And how are you being “forced” into anything? Literally you sound super racist.

personalfinance,fg6xx8w,t3_ewyyn8,1580579442.0,"Well from my experience, my parents have been secretive about their wealth.  They are super wealthy but at least when me and my siblings were younger they’d try to hide it by saying they were more upper middle class, we’d go to public school etc.  I am 23 now and still don’t know how much money exactly is in my trust fund, and all I know about my parents income is from working for my moms company as an intern in accounts payables.  I’ll also say that if your kids know your rich they may come to insane ideas of how rich (one of my siblings for example still probly thinks my parents are worth half a billion dollars when they’re likely worth less than a quarter that) so I’d try and keep them grounded in reality."
