cscareerquestions,ffvegta,t1_ffux8xg,1580262213.0,Thank you so much for sharing this. It has been an unexpectedly emotional trip reading through all of these comment. There are frankly a lot of more nuanced perspectives like what you've laid out the I just haven't thought about. Perhaps burnout has affected my meta-cognition and ability to meaningfully reflect. Thank you for providing some points to grab onto as I start dissecting this problem

cscareerquestions,ffuq06p,t1_ffuhd33,1580247105.0,"This is how I feel except I work at a startup, so that's not a really popular attitude to have as everyone vies for center-stage with their ideas. I love the energy but I really just love following a solid plan. Which is why I realize now more than ever how important good management is. I hate having to coordinate deployment windows, schedule demos, and do big-picture planning; but when told ""we need to design a continuous deployment pipeline to this env"" I'm all over it."

cscareerquestions,ffuplrx,t1_ffuo9hw,1580246878.0,"> My brain spins down when I'm bored and I end up feeling mentally fried afterwards.

Oh my gosh I'm so glad to hear someone else say this. That's exactly how I feel.

On days where I'm super invigorated (lots of team-play, reasonably complex assignment that I can do from beginning to end, i.e., no legacy nonsense, and being able to ask for help without being made a fool) I feel like a million bucks. But on days like today I just want to fucking go to sleep"

dogswithjobs,ffti6jy,t1_fftcqu7,1580221202.0,"I never even implied that, your logical deductions are lacking. The dog leaving him on the ground has nothing to do with the value of their respective lives, unless the dog learns to reason. The real implication is that the dog has no sense of ""preferences"" and it is trained to grasp the object one way or another; therefore if a particular method can present a threat to it's quality of life, why not remediate that?

I'm actually asking you (or anyone): why not train the dog to do it in a way that isn't harmful to it's life? It just seems like a shocking oversight"

It’s just a piece of property to fetch you shit. If you were invested in its life and health your response to such a story would be mitigating measures, not “spreading awareness” for fucks sake. Hope he leaves your ass on the ground gasping for air just to fuck with you someday and show you he isn’t just your slave. He’s a living animal /rant"

They probably feel bad for me lol The one way I do feel very blessed is that I ended up getting really big hips and pelvic tilt, from the shoulders down I look feminine, which is somewhat offsets my shoulder width but I think I would need another 2-3 inches on my hips to get a proper ratio.

 I'm considering getting the shoulder surgery maybe? do you think it's worth it? Or just getting fat transfer to my hips. I've seen some girls do that with good effects."

you guys are so annoying"
pointlesslygendered,ffrbeqd,t1_ffraen6,1580154549.0,"Mm thanks for asking! It's really hard for me to talk about which is why I'm getting therapy this year. But I feel like I'm just not a real woman, which is fine with me tbh bc I don't see how that even matters, but it makes it hard to feel like I belong in women's spaces. I also can't do voice training because I feel like I'm ""mocking"" women's voices (which is why I'm getting VFS soon). And when I talk to women I feel this need to act kind of standoffish so they don't think I'm like trying to force my way into their spaces/relationships. Just a bunch of really fucked up and incredibly damaging beliefs. It sucks because I know without a shadow of a doubt --in my own mind/soul -- that I'm a girl. It just makes sense to me. I also have broad shoulders, even for a males body, and even though my face passes my body never will so that basically discourages me from even trying. And I can never ever ever ever fix that. I've learned to ""live"" with it but I can't wear anything cute because I'll look disgusting in it. and I always get gendered based on my body bc it's so masculine. So fucking embarrassing.When ppl can't see my body I get gendered properly.

&#x200B;

 I just push away every single ""transy"" thing with contempt and disgust. 90% is because of how my body looks and knowing that I'll probably always have a males body which is just fucking gross and makes me feel like a sick twisted monster of an animal"

pointlesslygendered,ffqt8fo,t1_ffqstp4,1580143109.0,"tbf most guys have zero interest in wearing dresses or playing with dolls and wearing hair bows. it's more along the lines of things that are developmentally important: being able to show your emotions, being able to trust that your mother is emotionally available and won't ignore you because you're ""just a boy"", having the \*freedom\* to know that if you ever did want to come out, or even cross-dress or whatever that you wont be kicked out, even if that isn't in the cards for that child in particular. imo there's a lot more to gender than an aesthetic. and for men especially having healthy discussions around their place in the modern world is more important than ever."

FemaleHairLoss,ffqm4u3,t3_eunjhk,1580138272.0,"You can shave it and look at that as ""starting over"" ad then begin a regiment to repair it, it can help a lot psychologically to not have to stare at it in its current state every day. I had [IMMENSE hairloss](https://imgur.com/a/imyD37h) \-- and that before picture is even after 6 months of my treatment plan. I'm also a trans woman so my original loss was in part due to testosterone/DHT, and as you can tell by the pattern alopecia/TE-like hair loss. After 2 years of transitioning my body is more or less biologically driven by estrogen so my treatment is in the same way any other woman would address these. With that being said, shortly after the before picture, I shaved it all of and did the following treatment every day.

&#x200B;

Medication: 200mg Spironolactone daily, 2.5mg Finasteride daily, 0.5mg dutatseride weekly, HRT (4mg estradiol daily) FWIW, I ordered all of these online because they're very safe and haven't had any issues. Rogaine 5% applied in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night for 6 months, then applied in the morning and night for 12 months, and now I apply only at night.

&#x200B;

Stimulation: 1.5-2.5 microderm needling weekly while using [https://amzn.to/2t2OFrF](https://amzn.to/2t2OFrF) hair oil to massage into wounds, after microneedling: 5-10 minute massage until entire scalp tingles (due to peppermint in solution) this will also let you know if there are any areas you missed because you won't feel the tingle there. Daily 10 minute massages with hair oil (the type of oil probably doesnt matter, it the stimulation) 5 minutes in the morning and 5 minutes at night. 

&#x200B;

Throughout this process if my hair was growing in patchy I would just shave it down to maybe an inch or two and keep the process going. Eventually it started growing out such that it was impossible to see any hairloss, although it is still thin enough to were it is noticeable when wet during sheds, which I experience once every winter.

&#x200B;

It's a long proccess but it has given me a new quality of life that I didn't think was possible. And when it's shaved, it helps so so so so so much to not ""see"" the hair in your hands every day. It will just fall out and you'll never notice, but this allows the process to work. I also noticed that even after my yearly sheds sit grows back in thicket, so while they still make me depressed, with this routine there is a very high chance that your hair will continue to improve for years to come.
