 OP (US Citizen) and husband live in Russia. They want to go to the US and briefly get married and then go back to Russia. Later get a US green card. 

But everyone here is saying to go with a tourist visa. That isnt going to work. 

You to have documentation of the relationship spanning at least a ~year or more to prove to USCIS that the relationship is real. (Photos together, calls, text, etc)

OP is going to have to go the US and file for a K1 visa. Once the documentation goes through and the K1 visa gets approved you have to get married in 90 days. But your going to run into another problem. 

The green card. 

Once the husband gets the green card. The husband is REQUIRED to stay in the US. Meaning the husband can only stay in russia for 6 months max. Other wise your going to run into issues with immigration when traveling to the US. There is form that can be tacked onto the green card paperwork that will grant traveling outside the US. BUT regardless USCIS looks at all of this and sees how long the husband has been out of the US. 

Good luck.

EDIT: CR1 would work if you get married in russia first. It would be a simpler process based on the other replies. I'm just not familiar with the CR1. but the K1 visa is another alternative."
