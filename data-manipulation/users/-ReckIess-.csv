Damnthatsinteresting,feenpl3,t1_feemaou,1579037452.0,"Definitely agree. My employer is a small family owned business, but they treat me well as I’m their store manager. Insurance is only expensive because they let pharma companies name their price on everything. If that was regulated costs would go down tremendously"

Damnthatsinteresting,feel1h5,t1_feejj6c,1579035906.0,"The insurance companies charge based on a variety of factors, like smoking/drinking, occupation, age. Then you pay that monthly. When signing up you’re also told your copays, which are what your portion of a given service, will cost you. Then you have a deductible that you must meet before they start to pay more of a percentage. For instance, a lot of insurances say you must pay $1500 out of pocket before they start to cover everything 100%. Luckily for me my insurance through work is fully paid as a benefit, but if not it would cost me $280 a month ($560 but employer would normally cover 50%) as a non smoking male in the early 20’s. My insurance plan has no deductible though, so I only pay a copay, since we have a really good plan at my job. So if I go to the doctor I pay the $15 copay, and then my medication is covered mostly by insurance."

Within each lineup there are some that are the same, with a specific feature locked or unlocked (for example, K series are unlocked and can be overclocked)"
facepalm,fdcy75z,t1_fdcy2x0,1578287829.0,Yikes. Trying to start fights with people who have nothing to do with you makes you seem like a basement dwelling neckbeard
