astrology,fela79l,t3_epooxs,1579217445.0,"The conjunction occurred in my 6th house. The past few months I have been changing my daily routines after dealing with a ton of mental health + physical health issues (NN transiting 12H ain‚Äôt helping either). I‚Äôm now sober and have been eating better and working out more. My mental health is slowly getting better, although I‚Äôm still recovering from a ton of trauma from 2019. Last year was the worst year of my life"
astrology,feex005,t1_feevo8r,1579043042.0,Thank you. You said it perfectly. People need the freedom to use whatever system/methods they want!!
astrology,feewpcj,t1_feevmkk,1579042853.0,Dude there‚Äôs no reason to be passive aggressive here. Everyone has their own method of learning astrology. Don‚Äôt be bitter! We‚Äôre all learning in our own ways.
astrology,feewimr,t1_feew27j,1579042734.0,Right !! It‚Äôs helped so many of my friends to get into astrology who were nonbelievers before.
astrology,feeweyw,t1_feevzcd,1579042668.0,"I agree that people need to learn their placements and understand WHY they are a certain way. But like I said, it‚Äôs an introduction into the world of astrology. It can be scary for newbies to even get into it because there‚Äôs so much information. The Pattern is a way to get people started. Should it be taken super seriously? Probably not. But it‚Äôs a great way to get introduced to astrology. 

That‚Äôs just my take on it. I have been using astrology for so long now that I don‚Äôt even read the pattern much anymore, but when I first got into astrology it helped me out so much."
ENFP,feev6kg,t1_feeu5w3,1579041910.0,Omg couldn‚Äôt agree more. I always check out and have to re read. I‚Äôm better at watching videos about things or reading short things as well
astrology,feeuzr7,t1_feesyzx,1579041793.0,"I know that the pattern doesn‚Äôt necessarily explain astrology, but they have never even claimed to be an astrology app. On the App Store all it says is it‚Äôs a social networking app to better understand yourself and others. Not once do they even mention astrology. I admit it isn‚Äôt a good app for someone trying to learn astrology, however I think it‚Äôs a great way for non astrology users to get into astrology without even knowing it.

The whole point of astrology for me is to better understand myself and my patterns, as well as my friends‚Äô patterns. When my best friends thought I was stupid for loving astrology, I told them to download the pattern and all of a sudden they became amazed by how accurate it was and suddenly wanted to learn more. I think it‚Äôs a good INTRO to astrology app.

I just don‚Äôt think the pattern should be discredited completely. It‚Äôs almost like a sneaky way of getting normies into astrology without them even realizing it! I love the idea behind it. Again, that‚Äôs just my opinion. I know not everyone will agree with me."
Skincare_Addiction,feepvnh,t3_eonhyg,1579038707.0,"Yes, I would... but I would definitely shorten it. Like I would just cleanse, tone, and moisturize."
astrology,feeplq1,t1_feeov4b,1579038551.0,"Well American beauty is my favorite movie of all time. So there‚Äôs already a lot of sentimental value I have for it. I highly recommend rewatching it and paying attention to these scenes-

The scene where Ricky is showing the daughter Jane the video of the plastic bag saying that there‚Äôs so much beauty in the world, he can‚Äôt take it. And that there‚Äôs a benevolent force telling him everything would be okay. 

And of course the final scene where Lester dies and his final monologue about his life. My favorite quote of that was ‚ÄúI guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me, but it‚Äôs hard to stay mad when there‚Äôs so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like it‚Äôs too much, and my heart fills like a balloon that‚Äôs about to burst. But then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold onto it. And then it flows through me like rain and I can‚Äôt feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life.‚Äù I can recite it line for line without even looking it up!! It‚Äôs so good! Amazing scene if you understand the deeper meaning of the movie"
ENFP,feeh6jp,t3_eom0ji,1579033674.0,This is the story of my life. I‚Äôm always too much for people and give way too much of my heart and energy into others who don‚Äôt deserve it and I end up forgetting myself in the end.
astrology,feegwhe,t1_fee42c0,1579033512.0,"What we need is more earth in our charts!! To stay grounded! I‚Äôm a Leo sun, rising, & mercury and trust me the fire just makes my water energy way more dramatic and emotional. My chart is lacking a lot of air as well."
astrology,fee45vx,t1_fee0ca5,1579026023.0,"That‚Äôs a good one. My personal favorites to cry to are American Beauty, Inside Out, interstellar, now that I‚Äôm thinking about it probably every single Disney Pixar movie. Any movie that has some relation to my childhood"
astrology,fee3463,t1_fedrnu8,1579025402.0,"That‚Äôs because aquarius is an air sign! It‚Äôs not as emotional as water signs. You relate more to logic and rational thoughts rather than feelings and deep emotions. Not to say you don‚Äôt have emotions, because you do, you just don‚Äôt react as much to them"

astrology,fecl80d,t1_feckigr,1578976661.0,YES me too I always have to find old songs or a movie that related to my childhood or some memory to me and I cry. Also your big 3 are very intense and watery and I just wish I could give you a hug
astrology,fecl4n7,t1_fecjxvy,1578976590.0,Its satisfying for me to cry and then I feel so much relief after

Herpes,fdxh2vq,t3_ekwoe0,1578768643.0,I have gHSV1 and yes. I‚Äôve only had 2 outbreaks and I had that weird tender feeling in my thighs and legs. It‚Äôs super weird
Herpes,fdtz552,t1_fdlcku6,1578724640.0,Hey so update. I emailed my doctor asking for my results and she still hasn‚Äôt emailed me back. It seems really sketchy to me. If she assumes you can‚Äôt get HSV1 genitally maybe she just assumes I have HSV2 and thinks my lab results pick it up so she‚Äôs lying about it??? Maybe I‚Äôm going too far but it‚Äôs super sketch
Skincare_Addiction,fdsddoo,t1_fdowmj1,1578700079.0,Yes it is. I only use it twice a week and I haven‚Äôt experienced any dryness or irritation

HPPD,fdjc35v,t1_fdjblx5,1578464849.0,"? No offense but it‚Äôs probably a very small number of people who have lost their minds on zoloft. Most antidepressants exacerbate symptoms during the adjustment period so maybe he was already depressed and the meds just worsened it. Overall zoloft has helped me a lot, I‚Äôve been on it since September and definitely haven‚Äôt gone crazy. I think it‚Äôs just a few isolated incidents of people who have bad experiences on it, but that‚Äôs the same as every medication. certain SSRIs work better for certain people"
HPPD,fdiqqdq,t1_fdilg43,1578448920.0,"Yeah it‚Äôs really hard to change your mindset, it takes a lot of practice. Taking baby steps is key. Don‚Äôt try to tackle it all at once. Setbacks will happen of course, healing is never linear! I always convince myself I‚Äôm brain damaged too, but think about it.. there are so many worse things that could happen to your brain. It‚Äôs not a concussion or anything to that extent. I‚Äôm just grateful I‚Äôm alive right now and at least I have my vision. Some people are blind and still are so content with their lives, all because of their mindset. We will come to peace with this in time"
HPPD,fdiqhmi,t1_fdicr9v,1578448761.0,"Aw I‚Äôm happy for you!! I know in time I will come to terms with it. For now I‚Äôm trying to just accept it. I‚Äôm on 50 mg of Zoloft, I was on 75mg but it made me feel weird so I just decreased about a week and a half ago. Hopefully I start to feel normal soon"
HPPD,fdi2en0,t1_fdi0ev9,1578434520.0,"For me the biggest issue is that I‚Äôve had anxiety my entire life. I have control issues, like I just want to hold on to everything I possibly can and not change them out of fear. I mostly have health anxiety and fear illness because it‚Äôs out of my control. So I‚Äôll take a bunch of supplements and do all of these healthy things to prevent illness. It‚Äôs honestly an unhealthy thing to do because I‚Äôm reality of course we can‚Äôt control anything.

But we can change our perspective. That‚Äôs the one thing I‚Äôm trying to do, it‚Äôs just hard sometimes when my thoughts start spinning and I‚Äôm already down. I have mild ocd so it‚Äôs hard because I ruminate over negative thoughts and then I constantly need reassurance so I google everything. So really the derealization isn‚Äôt the underlying issue, the anxiety is. It‚Äôs my reaction to the derealization that stresses me out.

That‚Äôs an interesting perspective you have on drugs to help you out and face the HPPD. I got mine from excess molly use. It was my favorite drug, it does make me kinda sad I can‚Äôt do molly again. The main issue for me was the comedowns and how shitty my mental health would be after rolling. I‚Äôm trying to not do molly for at least a year to give my brain a break"
HPPD,fdhzrt4,t1_fdhzpic,1578433149.0,Like a week and a half
HPPD,fdhzl02,t1_fdhzdcv,1578433052.0,The thing is that when I started out on 50mg of Zoloft I felt much better. I could think more rationally and wasn‚Äôt having any anxiety. I increased my dose bc I felt like there was room for improvement. But now I‚Äôm back down to 50 because clearly the increase was too much for me. 50 is considered a low dose so I think I‚Äôm just gonna stay on it and see how I do. I went on it for anxiety and mild OCD
HPPD,fdhz7m2,t1_fdhyras,1578432850.0,"I mean I did see some improvement a couple months ago but recently I upped my medication dosage and felt more anxious and that‚Äôs when the derealization started, so I just went back down to my normal dosage and I‚Äôm still having anxiety & derealization. I‚Äôm sure the anxiety is causing the worsening of symptoms. I think I‚Äôm just going through a rough patch right now so everything is flaring up"
HPPD,fdhz1az,t1_fdhyjob,1578432753.0,"This was actually a really great comment and made me feel a lot better. You‚Äôre right. I‚Äôve been so focused on the future and thinking when ___ happens, then I‚Äôll be happy! When really I need to accept the present moment. I‚Äôve been trying really hard to accept my HPPD and just let it be, it‚Äôs just hard some days when I‚Äôm already down then I just spiral and ruminate over every negative thing. I have very obsessive thinking along with anxiety. I know that in time I will come to terms with this and it will become easier. I got it in August of last year so it‚Äôs still fairly new for me"
