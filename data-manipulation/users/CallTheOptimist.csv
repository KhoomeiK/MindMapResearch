news,fffv6yt,t1_fffsw0y,1579892503.0,"I've just heard this as a rumor from someone who worked as a chef on the Wexner property before. They had to clear an extensive background check to be allowed on the property in the first place, and were notified in polite words that Mr. Wexner uses security that were formerly members of MOSSAD and they were under no circumstances to be approached. The friend I knew was ex military and said these cats walking around loaded for bear* and looked very much the part."

Nestled among a handful of other extremely nice, prestigious properties is a plot of land at least 5 times the size of the others. Rows of vineyards, a gigantic stables complete with dressage arena, multiple baseball diamonds, multiple out buildings and parking areas for staff. When I first moved around here I heard the tales of an honest-to-God billionaire in what amounted to my backyard, and drove around that area trying to be a looky loo. There's one entrance that faces one public road, this entrance has a guard shack with a local police department cruiser stationed, there's privacy hills that obscure all but the absolute tippy top of the many chimneys, and all along the white fence that stretches around the property are little signs. I slowed way down to read one, it said, paraphrasing slightly 'CAUTION: AREA PATROLLED BY GUARD DOGS. GUARDS ARE ARMED WITH FIREARMS. ZERO TRESPASSING ALLOWED'"

Beats the heck out of the GOD DAMN GUBMIT handling this! How can you profit from the human suffering that way, is what i want to know."
