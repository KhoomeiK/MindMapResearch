Welding,ffp9emq,t1_ffjiw3t,1580089456.0,"By the way, you can create a query on eBay using their app. When an item shows up that matches your key words, it notifies you. If you craft a few queries using likely words, you can then sit back and wait. Someone is bound to put one on after a while. Things I've used: name brand, part number, etc.

Good luck!"

If you guys didn't get it on, he found someone else from the sound of it.  You're absolutely right that he has the same amount of time. Something else changed. Sorry."

* Don't give it up right away if you're wanting to be serious"

dating,fcw8uib,t3_ej63od,1578019802.0,"You don't want to commit and this sounds like she's looking for dad #2. If, on top of the vibes you get, your families may know each other, you should also take that into consideration. Broken hearted people can say/do all kinds of things (assuming you're right about her falling in love after sex).

It doesn't sound like you've got problems finding women, so I'll vote no on this one. Go play with other girls. When you feel like commitment, it'll come. Tell her 100% how you feel and what you sense from her, and let it be."

enfj,fcmdmzb,t3_ehtle0,1577771520.0,"I do it very commonly but don't consider it anything purely enfj. The ability to read someone comes from many visual and verbal queues. A significant amount of them are unconscious, which is where your gut comes in, but there are lots of things to learn to enhance it. 

An easy example is trust-gaining phrases. Pay close attention to these phrases:

* Trust me (or believe me)...

* You'll never believe this...

* The truth is...

There are many more, but I'm tired. The point is, when someone uses such a phrase, be *extremely* careful with what comes next. It may not be an outright lie, but there's a reason they are qualifying the statement."
