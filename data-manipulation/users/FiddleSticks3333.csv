Botchedsurgeries,ffesmyh,t1_fckmog5,1579863601.0,"I have this irrational fear of hitting my face on something and breaking my nose. It happens especially when I'm driving for some reason.

THIS though. Can you imagine? One punch in the face, or one awkward fall. Hell one child family member accidentally kicks her or hits her with a ball and her face is basically destroyed. It looks like if she sneezes wrong her face might bust and she'd need reconstruction involving her ribs or something."
Botchedsurgeries,fferz9r,t1_ffddr0l,1579862658.0,I am fucking astounded. I sort of want to know if she has more pictures? Like wtf this is nuts. It may be the worst one I've seen aside from that lady shoving her fingers in her sausage lips.
Botchedsurgeries,ffersmj,t1_ffd8lpl,1579862383.0,No come back to the thread someone posted a picture of her in just shorts in one of the top comments.
Botchedsurgeries,fferp3i,t1_ffeepxb,1579862239.0,"Part of the dysmorphia about female body image comes from objectifying women. Have you ever thought about what that *really* means? Women will get giant lips, tits, ass and eyes because the internalized misogyny tells them *that's all they are* and the men who appreciate it? That's all they see on a woman anyway. The bigger the better. It's not a person it's an ass to fuck.

Basically it's sexual signaling to an extreme."
Botchedsurgeries,fferc6j,t1_ffdv3h5,1579861697.0,I think if people can afford surgeries like this the odds are pretty good that they can also afford some custom or altered clothing. Like in ye olde times.
AskReddit,ffeoriw,t1_ffdpr2l,1579857827.0,I think you should probably clean the bathroom more for your wife.
BlackPeopleTwitter,ffdiy8n,t1_ffbztq6,1579821852.0,"Yes what you're describing what is known in economics as a liquidity trap. It can happen for a number of reasons, but one is by printing too much money, or by people spending less money because of a lack of faith in the economy. Basically money loses value."
MurderedByWords,ffdi9ll,t1_ffcc99v,1579821439.0,This is horrible. Please delete.
Botchedsurgeries,ffdfxhv,t1_fb7lbiq,1579820045.0,"I think thin lips can be very cute and beautiful. See Kylie Kardashian before surgery, Anna Kendrick, Emma Watson, Reese Witherspoon, Kiera Knightley.... Google the phrase ""actresses with thin lips."" I think you'll find it's beautiful, especially so in comparison with the filler people get. I think people look better the majority of the time when they don't alter their natural architecture. It's best to highlight what makes you unique. By way of example, Lady Gaga had hairstyles that showed off her big nose when she was first famous and that's when she was most beautiful."

AskReddit,ffcnmbn,t1_ffc57pk,1579803288.0,"I'm American and have been homeless. I am very scared of it happening again. It's very possible. My parents are shitty as well. I think it happens often here for a few reasons.

1. Poor mental/physical healthcare

2. ""Pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" individualistic mentality. 

3. Failing middle class. A lot of people couldn't help you if they wanted to so they find a reason why they shouldn't. 

It doesn't happen to everyone but I think you've made a pretty good observation."

On this sub for complex post traumatic stress disorder we often talk about this feeling. I'll be having a panic attack at home while desperately yearning for home. 

Basically it's not literal. You're longing for a feeling you either never had, or had and lost; a lack of belonging, acceptance and comfort.

I'm sorry you know this feeling. I hope you get to feel like you're at home someday."
