My company is a *Fantastic* example of growth: We obtained a very lucrative external investment opportunity  in the early 2000's. Then, our market share was <15%. In 15 years we've tripled our headcount at our HQ office alone and increased our marketshare to over 50%.

So you'd rather divert all the billions of dollars that funnel through the DJIA and SPX into employees pockets? Let's say that ALL trading on the spx stops. No buying or selling.

Company operations that depend on cash flow from the return on large investment projects stop too. The largest cash flow item is Salaries and Wages.

Edit: Soldiers are generally perceived as heroic or upstanding in nature due to our culture. Volunteers from around the country enlisted and helped gain our independence in the late 1700's. Enlisting in the Military is still considered a ""sacrifice"" in a general sense, since there are other career paths one could have chosen instead, and doing such is perceived as Patriotic since these guys and gals are choosing a career path that can ultimately ensure the safety of our country.

I do understand that most people that enlist in the military choose an MOS that's not combat oriented, like machinery mechanic, logistics staff, etc etc, roles that support the function of our military. But then you have to ask yourself, why did these guys and gals enlist in the Military to be a Humvee mechanic instead of going to Technician school? Well probably because the military provides that Training and is more accessible, and most of those in the military chose the option SO they can support and serve our country."
