The only way to tell if it’s a full tear is an MRI correct?"
dogs,fgfvdzi,t1_fgfpfk2,1580748446.0,"Thanks, I pinned that to a Pinterest board for future reference. We had that blue donut first, and she shredding that. Then the double cones. The vets had to search YouTube for a solution and that’s what they came up with. This was a few years ago."
AppleWatch,fgfq2jn,t3_ey7zl5,1580745043.0,Thanks for the great recommendations. I bookmarked each one. I think I’ll try the Barton option first. Even their non-leather straps look great.
dogs,fgfp181,t1_fgfnppu,1580744363.0,"Thanks for your helpful info. Our vet said blowing the other knee is likely as well. Half of the people I’ve talked to had repair surgery and the other half haven’t (family members, friends, my pharmacist…).  My husband in particular wants to try the non-surgical route first because she is able to contort herself to rip out stitches, etc. The last time she had surgery on her tail, the vet had to double cone her (1 up 1 down) to ensure she left it alone. I had to take her there every day because I couldn’t keep her in the crate at home with the cones on without supervision while we went to work."

dogs,fgfm6pc,t1_fgfljya,1580742423.0,"How long did you wait from the injury to surgery? You must live in an area where these services are common? Was the surgery around $4500 where you live? Looking back we now realize Piper favored the left leg but didn’t really injure the right leg until December. Unless they do an MRI, they can’t tell exactly what she did. Our vet took xrays but they don’t have the other equipment."
dogs,fgflnaj,t1_fgfl0qx,1580742038.0,"When I went back to the vet to discuss why they recommended TPLO, they said “based on her weight”. She’s 65lbs. They based this off X-rays and feeling her leg. They gave us a referral to a surgeon if she wasn’t better. From my research, it seems like vets immediately recommend surgery with no other options. There’s the $4500 TPLO option or the $1000 older method which doesn’t cut the bone. This brace might help her leg heal. If not and we have to go the surgery route, then it would help with her surgical recovery as well. The site [www.tiggerpoz.com](https://www.tiggerpoz.com) had a lot of useful info."

Virginia,fg3usi1,t1_fg2u1di,1580490122.0," I think comedians make great reporters too but if you’re going to share statistics, back them up. As a woman, reproductive rights are important, and as a Virginian, I voted accordingly. I also happen to think we need to have common sense gun laws."
Virginia,fg3uagq,t1_fg3qd88,1580489814.0,"They pair SB733 to HB980 (The Reproductive Health Protection Act passed two days ago), reconcile them, and then I assume they go to Governor Northam for his signature to become law."
Virginia,fg0n4s7,t1_fg0m4h4,1580411145.0,I’m glad they’re moving swiftly on gun legislation and LGBTQ issues too.  I hope marijuana is next.

I said Ireland was moving forward, not regressing like so many southern states.  No comment on birth control or sex Ed?"
Virginia,ffyjvnw,t1_ffyhdmb,1580348170.0,"Ultimately, it’s a woman’s decision and shouldn’t be up to old white men at all. Abortion is legal and all of these bullshit roadblocks are going to be removed. While other states race to the have the toughest laws, at least Virginia is swimming to the surface for a breath of air. Want to lower how many women seek abortions? Start by expanding access to birth control and better sex education. Even Ireland has moved forward."

macbook,ffs8iua,t3_eupmui,1580175753.0,The keyboard was a key factor for me getting the new 16” & I had a hard time seeing the screen. I found with Macs you should buy the computer you’ll use for the next 5 years. With that in mind I bought the 1 TB hard drive.

Gomorrah,ffqvdnw,t3_eudvv2,1580144500.0,"I recently watched the documentary “Maradona” on HBO and highly recommend it. When he arrived in Naples, the head of the Camorra protected him, gave him drugs, showed him off, etc. until Argentina vs. Italy. I found it really interesting with all of the footage they had.

aww,ffqrtc8,t3_eunt6m,1580142171.0,We adopted Sissy and her brother Macklin in 2008 as kittens and Piper in 2015 as a puppy. We think Piper is part Belgian Malinois and part Lab or something.

macbook,ffo88x5,t1_ffo6zoj,1580075090.0,I think the specs said it weighs 4.3 lbs. I bought the Fjallraven 201 backpack and it made it a lot easier. I don’t carry the power cord with me since I have an extra one at work.
macbook,ffo60at,t3_eud9eg,1580074460.0,"I had the 13” MacBook Pro and my company recently replaced it with the 16”. I had a hard time seeing the 13” screen and hated the butterfly keyboard. The new 16” is a lot more to lug around, but it’s worth it. I bought a certain backpack that makes it easier. I take it back and forth to work every day. I’m not in a college setting, so I don’t know the size of the desk you would be using it on. I love mine, and the new keyboard is such an improvement. Good luck!"

Due to bone loss and low sinuses, my oral surgeon and I  reviewed Nobel Biocare. He did my upper for $22,500 including 5 implants. With the Noble, they can put the implants in at any angle. The permanent was installed in December 2018. I just had the one year service done, and it’s been a lifesaver. I borrowed against my 401k to pay for it."

Exiting the agreement with Iran is just one of the many terrible decisions trump has made. The most shocking political truth is that the GOP won’t check his behavior.
