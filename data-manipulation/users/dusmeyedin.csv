rpg,ffilwfd,t3_etpk3m,1579977012.0,"My last RPG group disbanded about five years ago, because two of the players moved away.

Two of the remaining players have expressed interest in picking up solo games again. It would be one-on-one, GM with PC, and run parallel to each other. They might cross paths a bit, but I don't see it happening regularly.

Also, I was taking a trip through memory lane in Oglaf (an otherwise NSFW comic) and found this funny (and work-safe) cartoon:

AskReddit,ffif8xw,t3_etohsu,1579972457.0,"A lot of the movies about relationships tend towards the triumph of unlikely pairings. That's why they're storytelling material, I guess. Stalking somebody, dealing with unreasonable obstacles, and the solid belief that there's only one proper match for you in all the world, generally work better in movies than they do in real life.

Then you get movies that are pretty matter of fact about relationships. It's a brief scene in Office Space, but Peter Gibbon asks out a pretty server by just telling her he's going to have a table at a nearby restaurant for the next hour and a half, and she's welcome to join, and no problem if she'd rather not."

First off, there are sections of the book where the plot isn't particularly mobile, but the description is fantastic. My favorite chapters are the ones near the end where they're attending a horror-show of a funeral of a friend. Nothing huge happens plotwise, but the wry sardonic humor and the true-to-life portrayal of all walks of people during bereavement was spot on.

Also, there are parts of the plot that rely on previously hidden information with foreshadowing or clues, and they were fantastic in retrospect. Some parts were kind of lazy ""pull from thin air"" bits, but the biggest plot developments were generally well-seeded ahead of time and the lead-up was very enjoyable with additional knowledge.

Serious tangential question here (and not intending to be ""what-aboutism""): do the arms sales by the liberal-democratic permanent members of the UN Sec Council (UK, France, USA) contribute to destabilization of human rights globally as well?

Or are there organizational and ethical practices in such arms sales that minimize or eliminate such risks? I know the EU in 2010 (ish) wanted to move to normalize arms sales to China, but the US opposed it."
ravenloft,feypmbi,t1_feyni81,1579448818.0,"> HL, being a wolfwere and having some rough history with werewolves, hates all werewolves with a passion.

Ah, right, that was the deal - I'd forgotten a fair bit of lore from the setting!

Wordplay seems like something HL would do, so a look at the riddles from the Norse *Poetic Edda*, Grimm's Fairy Tales, or Odyssey could all help out.

I'm struck by a moment in *No Country For Old Men* when Sheriff Bell reassures Carla Jean Moss that she can safely tell him about her husband on the run:

> I promise you, Carla Jean, no harm will come to him from me.

His demeanor is so honest, and also so guarded (""I'm trying to protect him from others, and I can't promise they might not get him"") that she does confide in him. There's the voice of a man you can trust... but of course, by the time he gets out there, it's too late for him.

HL could be similar, depending on how you've played him.

In China, everybody's Chinese. Maybe less than 0.1% of any given city is going to be a non-Chinese person. So ""political correctness"" and ""cultural sensitivity"" just isn't really a thing over there. People will use stereotypes and terms that a non-Chinese could find very offensive... but there really are so few of them around that even the basic dialogue has not taken off yet.

And it goes both ways too. The Chinese will quite happily trot out stereotypes that are hostile or adverse to themselves, too. Recall in 2004 that a Chinese Olympian won the men's 110m hurdles - Chinese media trumpeted this win, along with completely unselfconscious discussion of how ""the yellow race tends to be less athletic than the black or white races so this is quite significant"".

Whereas in the USA and many other multi-ethnic countries, especially those with many new immigrants and a commitment to human rights and democracy, there's a much greater concern with how language can harm or demean a segment of society. One issue with being a minority in the first place, is that (even in a democracy, and almost certainly in a non-democracy) your numbers are too small to be mainstream. So an issue that affects your minority segment, may not attract the support or the understanding of the majority of voters. It can be very difficult to make legislative changes due to this - and from what I've seen over the past few decades, the most effective way of succeeding in this is actually to spread awareness and education. (Consider same-sex marriage rights. LGBT account for approx 10% of the population, and for most of history they have not been able to form legislative majority power. But starting from 2010 onward in the US at least, the growing education and awareness of LGBT issues, especially same-sex marriage, has now resulted in a majority of legislators and voters accepting same-sex marriage. This is a recent example of how a numerical minority managed to reach out, educate, and secure majority support for their issues.)

Not to make assumptions about the OP's screenshot - but I could definitely see if a Chinese-American was discussing sensitivity, and if a Chinese-Chinese was looking into the discussion from outside of the U.S., the two people would have very different viewpoints about what is acceptable and what steps should be taken (or need not be taken) to foster inclusiveness.

Again, I don't have any real context for the initial screenie, but just thought I'd share the above as a possible other factor to consider."

StarWars,feogu8n,t1_fefqmtd,1579299964.0,"> We'll just be getting a bunch of TV series for now.

Honestly, I think this may be *artistically* for the better. (Not commenting on commercial concerns - I guess some movies do better than TV series and vice versa from dollars and cents.)

Star Wars has gotten complex and sophisticated in its worldbuilding - the plots and twists now quite feasibly require more exposition time than a 2-hour movie can provide (even three movies merely clock in at 6 hours or so, barely one season of a TV series).

If Disney could bring additional plot lines to a TV series, it would help flesh out the universe with more development, and also allow enough time for truly cerebral, realized complex plots to be shown.

For example, Palpatine's political machinations in the PT are compressed by time... but in a TV series, you could introduce much more detail and screen time for developing many other plots, and then resolve them. The political/espionage complexity of *Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy* needed a 7-part TV series to fully explore back in the 1970s, and the 2011 2-hour movie couldn't really do it full justice.

Imagine the complex plots of a Thrawn story, which relies on setting up many inter-related elements towards a final gradual resolution. This doesn't lend itself well to a movie, unlike action- and magic-focused screenplays.

You need more time and space to fully explore cerebral (and social) based plots. If SW wants to move in that direction, it may want to move away from the ""cinema blockbuster"" and more to ""slow burn TV plot""."

gurps,feodo43,t1_feo5ara,1579298725.0,"WW2 is also pretty straightforward for OP, in the sense that it's grounded in reality, which makes it pretty reasonable to run with a very basic character.

OP: you can grab the (free) GURPS Lite handbook in PDF from the www.sjgames.com site, and then build your character with modest tweaking for their stats, maybe a few skills, and some equipment. 

The character building part is quite different from DnD, in that you have much more profound control over exactly what they can and can't do (want a guy who can soak up lots of hits and still keep going, but can't hit the broad side of a barn? You can build that! Or, want a guy who's great with gadgets and fast-talking in multiple languages,, but has no real field physical expertise? Not a problem!) but I'd recommend that you start off simple.

Running a game can be very abstract and rules-light if you prefer to learn that way. Just remember that you roll 3d6 whenever you're seeing whether something works and you're trying to roll UNDER the relevant skill (whether it's trying to punch a guy, trying to sweet-talk a guy, or trying to tie the guard's shoelaces together while he's sleeping and steal his jail cell key ring). The GM can assign penalties or bonuses as suits the situation.

If you're making an attack and you roll a success, you then usually roll a certain number of dice to determine damage. BEAR IN MIND THAT IN GURPS, COMBAT IS USUALLY PRETTY BRUTAL. If you were running a fantasy hero game, then GURPS has special rules to help you balance that out. But if you're looking at WW2 style ""high danger, keep your head down in the foxhole"" type play, this risky combat can be a much more faithful feel than DnD or other systems.

It's totally believable to have a WW2 era US new recruit sent off to the front lines with all attributes at 10 (or normal) and maybe 1-point training in half a dozen skills that the US armed forces thinks he may need to use urgently in the field. The GM can help guide the players by setting them as private soldiers under a sergeant. (And low-level soldiers would also genuinely learn quickly under pressure, with realistic gaining of points and spending them in skills.)

If you prefer a few more ""second chances"" in GURPS combat, one common houserule is that a player can spend 1 reserved Character Point to convert any successful attack into a 1-hp damage instead of its usual damage. Given that a WW2 style rifle may do 10+ HP of damage on average per hit (putting a normal 10-HP human at serious risk of unconsciousness and death) this could help beginner players survive their first adventure."

ravenloft,fekk3bw,t3_epjqsf,1579201702.0,"TL;DR - Azalin decides to crowdsource his metaphysical research using a drug and a Falkovnian invasion. PCs learn of this in layers of plot.

*""Azalin's plots are like the skins of an onion - by defeating one plot, you merely discover that you were working to realize a deeper objective of his all along.""* (Paraphrased from Black Box.)

Layer 1 plot: Darkonian PCs help a spy company investigate a leak of intel from Darkon to Falkovnian.

You've lost your memory and your employers are sending you on missions where you remember key things at important junctures. One small mission concerns a new drug ""*abfalduz*"" that spawns a small cult - the drug combines the consciousnesses of consuming partners so they experience the same hallucinations. The later missions gel together to suggest that your employers are investigating a traitor in your country's government who is feeding intel to the militaristic neighboring country. (Darkonian spy networks are investigating a leak from Darkon to Falkovnia.)

Layer 2 plot: Falkovnians complete their military preparations and launch a surprise attack, supported by good logistics and psy ops. They begin to convince the Darkonians that their own social institutions (and maybe their own rulership) are the true controllers of the Creeping Death undead scourge.

The Falkovnians, with tight coordination from their traitor within Darkon, have launched another massive military campaign. This time, their planning is efficient and their logistics are sound - they move from city to city in overwhelming numbers to keep the Creeping Death at bay (Darkon's undead currently only rise at night to prevent a general panic). Their psy ops play a slick game with public denunciations from monster hunters, noblemen, and sages to prove publicly that the Darkonian leadership and its Eternal Order church are frauds and are themselves directly in control of the dreaded Creeping Death. The Falkovnians show chilling military discipline and logistical coordination when they overrun Nartok by internal betrayal and grind through Viaki in attrition during daylight crossings from fort to fort, eventually threatening the capital of Il Aluk, and surrounding much of the royal forest containing the hidden Castle Avernus where a long ago ruler once ruled the nation.

Layer 3: The Falkovnian spymaster triumphs in a family feud against the Darkonian head, who dies. The PCs discover a way of leverage over the Falkovnian spymaster and force a defection, giving them insight to the Falkovnian war machine.

Your employer's top director is personally invested in the espionage conflict between the two nations. The director believes they have secreted their family safely in a third nation, and then wiped their own memory for safety in order to focus on fighting the enemy. However, the opposing forces have already located and eliminated the friendly leader's family, and used their deep cover to secrete their own. (Darkon's intel contractor dies during the conflict, and it comes to light that the organization has been taking steps to protect their forgotten family in the neighboring domain for many decades now. As it turns out, the Falkovnian intel director has discovered this some time ago, and secreted his own family in the same hideaway. Thus, the Darkonian efforts have unwittingly protected the Falkovnian secret... now that the Darkonian spy leader is dead, the PCs have nothing left to lose, and can exert pressure on this nerve in the opposite direction, against the Falkovnian leadership.)

Layer 4: The PCs learn that maybe the Darkonian king isn't dead after all, and one of his highest ranked officials is the traitor who gave intel to the Falkovnians.

After discovering this double subterfuge, the PCs can force defection of the Falkovnian spymaster, who then reveals key points about the Falkovnian invasion and the Darkonian high traitor who has been providing information. The Darkonian traitor is one of the top leaders in the cabinet - higher even than the Barons, and likely one of the conclave of rulers that stands in for the long-absent king, Darkonus Rex. The PCs investigate the Royal Apartments at Il Aluk, finding them long abandoned and no sign of the supposed king - as well as a passage to the Black Vault, a fortified dungeon of terrible artifacts and prisoners, that gives way to a truly surreal interlinked network of small teleportal cells scattered throughout Darkon.

Layer 5: Azalin himself is the traitor within Darkon, who has fed the Falkovnian leadership the vital information of Darkonian political and military weaknesses needed to goad them to a new invasion. Azalin's plan is to enslave all sentient life in Darkon as part of a massive drug-fueled neural net - and if he can trap a few million Falkovnians in it, so much the better.

Azalin Rex, once and reluctant king of Darkon, is still very much active out of the public eye, but has been focusing all of his attentions on research to leave the Demiplane. Oblivious to the passage of mortal time, he has been spending the past five or so decades in a laboratory over the Shadow Rift, studying the protomatter nature of its mists and the possibility of mounting an escape from there. Azalin's initial idea was to cultivate a cadre of concentrated expertise in several elite experts, and then collaborating them together to reach a research breakthrough. However, this is slow, time-consuming work (much of which is thwarted by unreliability of candidates at selection, as well as the contradictory nature of training them up to expertise, while expecting them to innovate). 

Accordingly, starting a decade or so ago, he has hedged his bets with a second approach - a sort of medieval fantasy ""crowdsourcing"" of research to harness the mental power of the entire nation's peons... and those of the invading nation to boot.

What if millions of laymen could be harnessed in tandem to provide even greater computational results than a cadre of geniuses? What if you could persuade your populous next door neighbor to commit millions of soldiers, police, recruits, civil servants, and laborers to cross the border into your realm in the name of liberation or conquest? What if all you had to do was to taint the water supply with *abfalduz* across their path of conquest, thus preparing the way to combine all their minds together in a shared hallucination? And what if you dictated their hallucination to be a problem-solving distraction, aimed at speeding the research that had stymied the minds of a small number of elite experts? Zombies - the dead kind - don't make for helpful survey respondents... but what about slaved human minds all linked as one giant processer?

What if ""all of us are truly smarter than some of us""?

If the threat of mindless drug-addled mental slavery isn't bad enough, it's also implied that the eventual scientific solution to Azalin's magical project will require the conversion of large amounts of mass into raw energy to allow him to escape. The order of magnitude is around the mass of the Northern Core and everything on it. This is a sacrifice Azalin is willing to make, but it bodes poorly for everybody else in the area."

Gaiman avoids this with his deeply sympathetic viewpoint of an Old-Worlder left adrift in the New. A sorrow of loss and rootlessness pervades the mortal characters (including the protagonist and his stricken wife) as well as the divine or demigod supporting characters. Their struggles and goals seem feasible, rather than capricious ""But legend demands it"" style railroading.

One final thing that won my admiration was a (deft) final mechanic where Gaiman absolves his story of any sentiment of cultural appropriation - throughout the entire novel there's an undercurrent that Old World people brought their beliefs with them, and their faith in the New World created these gods anew. Gaiman gracefully clarifies at the end of the book that the deities running loose in the New World are pale reflections of the Old World gods, and not the actual gods themselves. The Odin who plots and schemes in America was a copy of the noble Norse god still watching the fjords back in Scandinavia. It's a poetic way of saying ""America was the graveyard of these gods... but only of their American selves - the originals are still safe in the Old World"".

StarWars,fedpipv,t1_fe4l7ef,1579017087.0,"Seconded. Thrawn legends was the first big EU novel and it was written at a time when information warfare was becoming more important in the real world. The Evil Empire of the USSR had just collapsed, leaving rogue terror orgs and loose nukes as the next big threat, and Zahn worked that whole zeitgeist beautifully into his work.

He also avoided the reuse of ""next big superweapons"" that other SW media hasn't always been able to do."
