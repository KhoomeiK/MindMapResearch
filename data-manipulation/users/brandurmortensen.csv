You do that when your mom yells at you dont you? Or do you start beating her because you werent abused by her in your childhood?

There are plenty of great e-books/audio books online, i used Dean Sluyters â€œMeditationâ€ e-book. Other than that, i would recommend a higher dose of mushrooms, as in 1-2g, but you need to go into the trip (do not worry, it will be mild, considering you dont have a top10 potent strain), these doses will not pull you into another universe, but they are still extremely powerful therapeutically. Go into the trip with the mindset of â€œfixingâ€ yourself, this will be you confronting your feelings, even those that lay dormant within you. It sounds like hocus pocus, but it will make total sense when you are in-trip.

You are going to have to confront these traumatic feelings, it might be a bit uncomfortable (or it might not be, as it was in my case), but the end product is absolutely blissful, and i have no doubt that you will be able to do exactly what you think is right when it comes to your family, be it confrontation, silent acceptance or just isolating you from them.

Do not take these feelings of yours lightly, you have had some traumatic experiences that couldve completely broken you and made you turn to suicide. People have killed themselves for less, so please Please PLEASE give yourself some recognition for being amazingly strong and willing to make your life right.

One last thing; you are awesome. I havent had any traumatic experiences even close to yours, but i still felt like absolute shit, bordering on suicidal thoughts as in they came, but went away quickly because i was quick to remind myself that my mother would be absolutely devastated if i offed myself.

wholesomememes,fer45hf,t3_eqdlzl,1579349547.0,"Yup, its becoming legal now because of the absolutely insane positive effects and exactly 0 (!!). found side effects so far, but sadly propaganda will make you think im either a crazy drug addict (when the substance is actually anti-addictive, meaning you have an incredibly easy time flushing all your addictions and gaining more control of those thought patterns) or trying to poison you. Im talking about psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (and its research alternatives like 1P-LSD and LSD-25) and mescaline. I am of course talking about microdosing, which means you take such a small amount of a chosen psychedelic that you wont feel any high in your body or your mind, its sub-perceptual. 

Iâ€™d highly recommend reading some of the incredible stories on r/microdosing, and studies have confirmed the substance is completely safe to consume. Of course we need many more studies and trials, but it doesnt hurt to try, like literally doesnt hurt in any way according to the studies we have so far. Most dangerous parts of these substances are if you get caught by the police (funny isnt it) and if you take a massive dose that overwhelms you and you dont have someone as a â€œtrip-sitterâ€ beside you. This is whats called a â€œtripâ€, and depending on the intensity, it can do real damage, but its also an incredibly therapeutic experience that lots of people use 

This shit changed my life. I have gained a lot of contol of my feelings, i feel connected with my sub-concious and for the first time in my life it feels like my brain is working properly. I am happy, empathetic and compassionate, i feel fulfilled and content with my life, I am creative, productive and much more intelligent in a number of ways. I could FEEL my depression and anxiety just melting away after the 3rd or 4th dose. Its the most powerful self-healer in the world, but its not a magic pill, its a fantastic and ultra easy tool you can use to fix all your minor and major flaws by re-wiring your brain. The amount of people this would benifit totals to every single normal and healthy person on the earth (NOT people who suffer from kind of psychosis though!), and im not exxagerating here, everyone could use a boost of empathy and compassion and i fully believe the world would become a much better place to live in a bunch of different ways. 

Do your research and listen to the mycologist Paul Stamets, iâ€™d recommend his appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast, this man is incredibly knowledgeable when it comes to fungi, both psychedelic and non-psychedelic.

Edit: I also have a theory that this will eliminate the sexual urges of pedophiles (and help their victims), and help people who are confused about their gender. I was trying to not oversell it here, but it really is an incredible substance which grows naturally. It WILL replace most of the SSRIâ€™s and MAOIâ€™s out there that happen to have a humongous amount of side effects and will become the ultimate â€œcureâ€ for PTSD. Homeless people need this, downright mean and selfish people need this, politicians REALLY need this etc etc. The thing is, it doesnt just have therapeutic effects, its a performance enhancer aswell (again, without side effects) as in it makes you more focused and creative. The world is going to drastically change for the better when these substances are being prescribed. 

I could write so much more to be honest"

It is the same as a bear rushing towards the dogs owner, the dog would attack with no hesitation and with no regards to his own life to protect the owner. They also have a hundred times better reaction times than humans do."

Well those amazing experts of yours also classified shrooms as a highly addictive and dangerous drug, it wasnt until recent years when studies came out that psilocybin is completely safe to consume if you do not suffer from some kind of mental psychosis, has incredibly therapeutic effects that are far more prominent than the SSRIâ€™s people take for depression, having exactly 0 side effects (!!) compared to the hundreds of potential ones in said SSRIâ€™s, while also being an anti-addictive drug meaning you not only cant get addicted to them, they help you permanently quit any other addiction you might have. Your â€œexpertsâ€ have deliberately held back the wonders of psilocybin from the world for financial reasons, so i would say to not trust everything they say. Dont diss the shrooms man, they saved my life, literally."

reddevils,fd0rfb8,t1_fd0654b,1578122749.0,"I feel like its the complete other way around, we have been rushing like crazy to get the signings, paying top dollar for below average talent that doesnt fit any of the plans any of the managers of the last decade have had.

You are 100% correct with us being in a desperate situation, but i choose to believe that Ole and his coaching staff managed to talk the owners into giving a full season to not only work out tactics and create a playing style, but to give our players a chance, especially the young guns, i just dont get why they wont play Garner and Gomes. Garner is injured now, but he has been fit and playing well all season for the reserves, and he has been hungry for first team action. Other than that, i believe in Ole and co. having a plan in mind, and im ok with them squndering this season for the sake of said plan. I also love how he has treated our young first team players, they have been at their individual best this season, DJ has also been great, and i credit Ole for that. But yes Glazer out.

No offense taken my friend, i completely understand haha"

reddevils,fczlkjh,t1_fczkstf,1578103878.0,"Dude, youre saying we should hurry up and buy players that the manager doesnt want, that wont fit in or be of any use to us this season and will take a lot of time to coach into good players, instead of waiting until summer so we can get some much better and more fitting signings. I do not understand your logic, because this is exactly what we have been doing since Moyes was appointed, this leads to an incredibly unbalanced team that cant play together.

Edit: i realise i may come off as being rude with this comment, it isnt my intention at all."

Iâ€™d rather we concede this season than fill our team with useless players with huge wages like Moyes and LVG did. We dont just need any players, we need the right players."
EverythingScience,fcxyiaq,t1_fcxxv9u,1578072249.0,"You overestimate the difficulty, its so incredibly easy. 

What? You know exactly what ingredients there are, psilocin and psilocybin, nothing else.

Well that just shows you havent tried it yourself and you have no idea what youre talking about. Maybe scratch the â€œfullâ€, but you do gain control. 

Maybe read a little about psilocybin and its effects man."
EverythingScience,fcxur9y,t1_fcxt3xb,1578070700.0,"If people figure out that you can grow 5 years worth of microdosing in 1 month at home, then i highly doubt they will want to go out and buy expensive synthetic (also a good argument to grow your own, fully natural with nothing added).

Thats true, but psilocybin is capable of replacing a lot more than just SSRIâ€™s, i just used it as an example. 

I could also use the tobacco industry as an example, they are going to fight tooth and nail against legalization, because psilocybin grants you full control of the part of the brain and body that make you addicted in the first place. There are plenty of people who will loose big money if this substance is legalized.

Edit: growing psilocybin isnt like growing marijuana, its a much simpler, faster and easier growing process."
reddevils,fcxljas,t1_fcwyqut,1578065846.0,"So even if none of the players Ole wants are available, we should buy 2 players just to use them for half a season and HOPE they turn it around, before finally getting the real transfers in the summer?"
