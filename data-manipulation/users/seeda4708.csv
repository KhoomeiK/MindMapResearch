Pussy is a great character and they gave him such a great character arch. I’m personally a huge fan of Sil."
SuicideWatch,fg18owj,t1_fg181yc,1580422810.0,"Loved Breaking Bad. It could be time for a rewatch. Sopranos is easily
My favorite show. Might be the best ever. Curious, who’s your favorite character?

Haven’t tried Better Call Saul. I know it’s not Breaking Bad but does it come close to being as good?"
SuicideWatch,fg17we8,t3_ewd7oa,1580422447.0,We’re all messy. You’re not alone! I need a good show to watch.  Recommend something for me?

He’s gotten me out, moving and refocused. I have anxiety, fatigue and was depressed. I’m not saying a dog is a cure-all but having him has been life changing.

Puppies come with their own set of challenges, be assured. They take time, patience and plenty of energy but the benefits, the bond and the live are all worth it. They’ll make you move and you’ll also want to."
