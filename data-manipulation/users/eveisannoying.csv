Second- in some women's prisons, you have to BUY tampons, pads, etc, and prisoners who can't afford them often live in disgusting conditions because they bleed all over themselves. Some have even died of toxic shock syndrome because they rationed tampons and left them in for too long.

Third- in a LOT of countries, feminine hygiene products simply aren't available.

Fourth- in certain countries, women are exiled to ""menstruation huts"" during their period because they are considered ""unclean"". Due to bad conditions in said huts, many die.
