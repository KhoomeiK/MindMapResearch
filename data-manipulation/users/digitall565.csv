You can find some special places with good deals but honestly you have to arrive early and be diligent about looking.

SpainAuxiliares,ffac03u,t3_esfpt6,1579731964.0,"So, a couple of things. First, yes, people in Spain are loud, even people in northern Spain can be loud if less so than the south (personally I think overall there is not that big of a difference, I lived in Bilbao and it was pretty loud).

There is a ton to do in Spain although a lot of it revolves around drinking. In my experience though people don't really seem to judge others who don't drink. 0% beer is sold everywhere, it is fine to get a soda or even a cafe con leche at a bar at any time, so you don't really have to drink, but people will be drinking. Not just at bars but in public (depending where you live), at cultural events, I mean I even got to have cider and wine at the school that I worked. So it is present but you don't have to drink. It also pretty easy to meet more people once you know a few, and you will definitely meet a few online and in person when you arrive at your city.

But finally I will reiterate that yes, Spain is loud. Spanish classrooms are almost unanimously rowdy and loud so that is likely something you will have to do every day. And regardless of where you go north or south, if you choose to live in a major city, keep in mind these places are densely populated, there is urban noise at night whether you live in Bilbao, Oviedo, or Santiago. I straight up called the police one time because I lived across from a park, and these construction guys decided to do some work at... 1 am. Not a very typical experience, but the point is that if you go live in any moderately sized city or larger you will have to deal with some level of noise, really like living in any major city anywhere.

edit: Just saw that you mentioned not knowing much Spanish. That will be a problem in most places. You can rely on most young people knowing from a few to a lot of words in English, but that's not really reliable, and outside of that your mundane interactions (bank, grocers, most of your teacher coworkers, etc) will usually be in Spanish. However, I did know people who got by not knowing a lot of Spanish at all, so if you're open minded about learning quickly (or just toughing it out) there are certainly others that do that."

It sounds like your experience is different, but I've never worked somewhere it was seen as appropriate to show up late often and leave 1-2 hours early on a Friday. Some higher ups could, but this was never a regular thing in the corporate offices I've worked in. People worked to their schedules.

And yeah, the schedule might be 40 hours or slightly less on paper.

Many people are also expected to be ""on call"" either by email, text or phone, and if I have to work during my leisure time, that counts as work.

AskAnAmerican,fesu9hd,t1_fesalz0,1579369046.0,"Yeah, and it was. It was inextricably linked to what America was doing throughout its history and to insist otherwise is BS. People can take issue with 1619's interpretation of history (no surprise though, they tell you up front they are looking at US history through the lens of slavery) but the historicity is not really in question by any significant historian. 

Note that there is a difference between someone not liking their interpretation and the historicity of the events they describe."
AMCsAList,fes092s,t1_fergolt,1579360155.0,"Yeah I would hope it's kind of an open choice but I can see them keeping it to families only somehow. I'm not married and don't have kids but I don't use all my movie slots, and I'd be happy to use them every now and then to take friends to see movies with me."
AMCsAList,ferzxog,t1_fepquiy,1579360047.0,"I think that's a huge simplification of their business. Kids are huge drivers of consumption and many parents just want to make them happy. Notice they put all the candy at kids eye level. Plus your A-List is covering the tickets, so it's the same incentive regardless, ""your ticket is 'paid for' so go ahead and spend some money on food"""
AMCsAList,ferzlyk,t1_fepl3rz,1579359928.0,"> only 2 per week. If you’re going to see more

If you have a family of three, I can't imagine you're going to the movies more than 2 times a week anyway. And definitely not *more* than that by yourself. I can see this working for families."
Entomology,ferwzz7,t1_fervdof,1579359200.0,"That sounds good, thanks again. We do have mango and avocado trees which it sounds are (hopefully) not threatened by them."
Entomology,feruhyp,t1_fertsxb,1579358498.0,Thank you for the very quick answer. So no real worries having found this in my house?
Miami,fepk3p3,t1_fepczeo,1579322560.0,"It's funny that you mention Whole Foods, that's pretty much the closest I've found to a ""normal"" butcher here. I bet if you asked for that stuff they could probably get it for you quick. Organs and stuff like that I tend to see in small Latin markets too."
Miami,fep0dn6,t3_eq7vcs,1579309327.0,I tried the duck and it was pretty good. The quality of everything looks decent to great but I'm still on the search for a good not upscale butcher in Miami. Wish we just had some old school butchers where you could get good stuff how you want.
IAmA,feozr6b,t1_femu80h,1579308935.0,"I don't know their exact methods but I'm sure they have a collaborative process for researching prices on different routes and there's quite a few people in different time zones around the world working for them. 

So I doubt they've got anyone on a 12 hour work day, I think he just meant that kind of round the clock effort is what it takes to find the deals."
AskAnAmerican,feogfkm,t3_eq765x,1579299801.0,"Miami and greater South Florida have got to be pretty up there. It's a nightmare driving here. Personally I think it's much more noticeable than cities that have similar reputations like Boston. Some people here really don't deserve to have a license to drive.

It's actually kinda funny, when you drive along I-75 or I-95 through Florida down to Miami, the traffic and driving become noticeably worse as you cross over into Broward and Miami."
AskAnAmerican,feof2qe,t1_fenmkns,1579299231.0,"My high school in South Florida had many, many parents dropping off their teenage kids at school. Despite there being lots of buses. I would say this is true for pretty much every school down here. And our elementary and middle schools do start later, but not that late either. They are actually trying to make the start times later than 7:20 and the parents and students are the ones pushing back."
IAmA,feo0aq9,t1_fenvqxd,1579293411.0,"Eh, the opposite can also be true, which is why it's so important to shop around. Sometimes booking sites include breakfast that is otherwise charged separately at the hotel. One time I got screwed because a hotel reservation I had was not prepaid and they were overbooked - and the third party reservations that were prepaid were getting priority for rooms there and nearby. 

I've also called hotels to try to beat a rate and they've straight up told me that I was looking at a better rate than they could offer me."
television,fenyrax,t1_fenmlpw,1579292757.0,How is it not? It's meant to provide all sorts of content as evidenced by... that's what they do.
AskEurope,fengowz,t1_fen421s,1579284301.0,"People are just generally unaware of the cost of living in other places. I think this goes for everyone. I'm American and when I lived in Spain I would get so many questions from my American friends back home about how I survived on what I was making as a teacher. And the truth is that small sum went farther for my quality of life in Spain (affording rent and transportation, going out for beer and wine, pintxos) than it would've at home."
AskHistorians,fen3v1c,t1_fen22sm,1579276382.0,">Do you really think an occasional false positive is bigger problem than the false signal we get from posts with nothing but deleted content? 

Do you really think a huge change to the subreddit entailing what the mods described above is better than just hitting the back button on those threads? It could hardly be a smaller inconvenience."
Miami,fen1ecu,t1_fe6n170,1579274807.0,"Near NMB, Vegas Burger Bar is a pretty chill place. Good burgers, great mac and chili (combine them if you're feeling particularly unhealthy) and I've met some interesting people passing through there before."
solotravel,felk9v0,t1_fek0yp2,1579224201.0,Honestly I think a lot of places are like this. I have even been on buses with electronic signs that are not turned on or that only display the general route you're on.
AMCsAList,feladw1,t3_epks46,1579217563.0,Huh? I got advance tickets at Pines for Endgame and TROS. In fact I can't recall having had an issue with advance tickets for any major release in SFL.
