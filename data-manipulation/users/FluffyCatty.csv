Is this a meme? Not only do you eat eggs every day but 8-10 a day? 32-60 a week???? 

I know entire families that have 3 pet chickens and have so many eggs they give them away, if you had your own you'd need 5-9 just to feed your self.

There are so many jobs I haven't applied to because they don't tell you anything about the schedule or pay, they just say vaguely threatening shit like ""looking for a passionate team player who understands the busy world of retail never sleeps!""."
WhitePeopleTwitter,ffyupe8,t1_ffynhag,1580355608.0,That sounds more like a you problem. If all you see in real life is toxicity you need to surround yourself with better people.

I've never understood why people think rewarding based on genetics and upbringing is any better of a system than judging on other things we can't choose like race and sex.
