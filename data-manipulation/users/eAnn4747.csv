retirement,fcgphsg,t1_fcewqh3,1577642714.0,"My plan is to put in $6,000 this year and then skipping a year and doing it again and then just feeling out the rest of my future years and deciding then on whether to invest or not. When i turn 18 I am inheriting a trust fund with $50,000 if i go to college, which i plan on doing. Also, due to some circumstances i do not have to pay for any of my college tuition and will be living at home while attending. I also have a job which I've been saving money from in order to pay for books and what not. 
I do understand your point though. Life is unpredictable. So I will be putting most of my money to the side so that hopefully i can easily conquer anything that happens. I was thinking maybe putting $20,000 aside but im still not sure just yet"

Gifts,fa9fdvt,t3_e85soe,1575871587.0,"My boyfriend is similar, he started cooking his own meals though and so i bought him a rice cooker last year, and he loved it. You could also get him a nice computer chair, speakers, head phones/wireless ear buds, or a good mic. Or maybe those car lights that bounce to the music that are becoming popular."
