science,fdawi3s,t1_fd9uj9t,1578251171.0,"> This isn’t 100% true. It takes time for the virus to build up in your system. If you were to get tested for HIV in the weeks/months after exposure, you would likely test negative. That’s why they want you to get tested 3 and 6 months after at least. People can actually live years with untreated HIV and feel completely healthy. 

You're confusing unrelated things. The tests that take 3+ months to detect HIV are antibody tests. They're testing for the antibodies that your body produces in response to an infection. It takes time for your body to learn to produce those. But it does not take that long for the virus to replicate to infectious levels - in fact, by the time antibodies develop, the peak infectious period has already passed (because the antibodies are doing their job). 



> The people who transmit HIV the most are usually not aware that they have HIV.  Those on medications can reach an undetectable amount of the virus in their blood. It’s been proven that if you have a low enough amount of the virus in your body, you can’t transmit HIV to another person through sexual contact.

This is all true. However, for someone who is not on medication (for example, someone who doesn't know they're HIV+), the first few weeks are the most infectious period, followed by months or years of being infectious but much less infectious, followed by a marked increase as the infection progresses to an advanced stage (AIDS)."
