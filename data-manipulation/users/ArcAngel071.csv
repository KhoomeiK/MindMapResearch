it's been done!

Honestly the best way to get the unhindered by laptop thermals is to use an external dock with a regular off the shelf GPU.  Laptops are always a compromise against thermals in favor of form factor and portability. Though as cards get more power efficient it's getting easier to cram them in. Hence the 2070 laptops. I have an Asus ROG Strix scar 2."
pcmasterrace,ffh3xlk,t1_ffg51f0,1579922442.0,"I mean I have a laptop with a ""full"" 2070 in it right now.  Same Cuda core count.  All 8gb vram and if the load isn't to heavy it will boost to over 2000mhz occasionally. 

It's limitation is thermals while in the laptop form factor of course. Harder games and it'll sit in the 1700's mhz range when the fans are set to fill performance.  

If I'm playing in a warm environment it can get down to 14-1500mhz which definitely sees a performance impact but it's so overkill already that even that can run Battlefront 2 at 1080p high/ultra at 144fps"
