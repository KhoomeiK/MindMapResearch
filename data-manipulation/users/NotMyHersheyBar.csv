AskAnAmerican,ffd1abx,t3_esix2c,1579811445.0,"Irish people are pretty dispersed, but you can still find Irish pubs in East Coast northern cities. Phiadelphia and the surrounding suburbs has a significant Irish presence and a lot of pubs. St Patty's day is a big deal, there's a parade and everyone is Irish for a day.

There's a lot of Irish pubs in San Francisco, too, mostly downtown close to the business district."

AskAnthropology,ffcugvn,t1_ffci9mz,1579807501.0,"""Brown people couldnt have built this, it must have been aliens"" is the source of a lot of white people claiming that humans couldn't have built stuff despite archaeological and experimental evidence showing that they could and they did"
Cooking,ffctpg6,t3_esklbe,1579807059.0,"I buy store brand everything unless the name brand is on sale cheaper. Only a few things are better:

Spaghetti sauce in jars, tuna in cans, dry coffee, yogurt, chocolate

Pretty much anything where water or substandard ingredients will really make a difference in taste or cooking chemistry. Compare the labels, if you see water or high fructose corn syrup in the first three ingredients, or a lot of chemicals, or hydrogenated oils, or a lot more sodium in the store brand, get the better one. But sometimes the store brand may  be better, like juice. You just have to read the labels."
gadgets,ffcqvwb,t1_ffc3vu2,1579805375.0,"I just replaced my 5s and it wasn't like that at all.

No excessive updates. Updates as usual.

Very few apps just wouldnt run. Sometimes I couldn't do the apps full function or I had to be on good wifi. Like I couldnt listen to internet radio and browse social media underground (subway) at the same time. But that's also bc of sprint. I guess apps opened a little slower? Like 5 seconds instead of instant. Games sometimes took a while to load if it was downloading new levels. 

The camera wasn't great and I couldnt play like, super heavy duty games, but I dont use my phone for heavy media.

Some things were better. Since the phone was old, a lot of ads were blocked. There was a beneficial bug in my internet radio app that let me skip ads if I pressed play/pause fast. I didnt get a lot of the updates people complained about bc my phone couldn't support apple's stupidest new ideas."
