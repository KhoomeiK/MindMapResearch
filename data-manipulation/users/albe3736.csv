suggestmeabook,fcwxspm,t3_ejad07,1578042205.0,"I don’t know how old you are, but I have a top 3 of very good Young Adults books:

• I’ll give you the sun - definitely the best book I’ve ever read. Lots of good quotes as well.

• Anna and the french kiss - Trilogy (I read this half a year ago, and it made me get into reading, I’ve read non stop ever since)

• Our Chemical hearts - it’s a very beautiful and non cliche story. It’s beatiful and tragic and sets focus on lost of subjects.


Now remember that when reading a book, you have to go at least 100 pages in to stop reading. T seems very thick, boring and endless in the beginning but it’s worth it."
