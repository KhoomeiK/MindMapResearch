SuicideWatch,fe5rmpq,t3_enscwk,1578873601.0,Right on!
SuicideWatch,fe5rgms,t3_enqks5,1578873547.0,Life can be cruel. I know. It can also be beautiful. You just can't see that now. That's ok. Find someone that can help you to see the light again. Sending you lots of love....
therapy,fdh14jn,t3_elc866,1578413105.0,You don't have to write anything down. Just think of one goal you want to reach after a few sessions. If the therapist makes you feel uncomfortable just tell that. Therapy only works when there's trust. The therapist is the one that should make you feel totally comfortable.
CPTSD,fa0e3gg,t3_e7fqn8,1575753625.0,Totally agree with you. The problem with mental issues is that it's not visible from the outside. If you feel like you need help with your mental issues don't rely on bystanders but search for a professional.
