AskReddit,ffrjkbd,t3_euft5h,1580159326.0,"Back in college, I was in statistics class and there was a chick who was super smart and ahead of the class, so she would spend the entire class talking to her boyfriend. Three classes before the final exam, I could tell the instructor was distracted by her as she was bring particularly loud and obnoxious, so I politely raised my hand and, when the instructor called on me, I asked the chick to please stop talking so the rest of us could concentrate. She gave me a dirty look but stopped talking, and the rest of the class thanked me at break. Just because you're smart doesn't mean you can be rude."
