dreamcatcher,ff7udx7,t1_ff7bhhc,1579658592.0,"It's probably safer for her to be in a dance group to start. She is a good vocalist, but if you put her in a group with people who can sing like Siyeon and Yeonjung (WJSN) she'd get overshadowed. IDK how it works with the Chinese shows, but on the Produce shows, the dancers tend to be picked to be center. If she shines in dance she will get more center spots later."

DecidingToBeBetter,fdzqy4x,t3_enej6o,1578793767.0,"So I had a similar problem in college. What I found helpful was listing everything I had to do in a month. HS isn't as structured so you'd probably be better off doing it weekly. I don't mean just big stuff I mean literally everything. It can be as small as sending an email or as big as finishing a project.

Once you write everything down work on the small easy things first. For me motivation has always been a game of momentum. Not to go full nerd but the law of inertia can be applied mentally. If you check off a bunch of small tasks you will feel more mentally prepared to do bigger tasks. Its like a warm up you do before exercising.

Let yourself be proud of anything you get done even if it's not everything you wanted to do. Focusing on the negatives breaks the momentum. Restructure your plan and try again tomorrow."

dreamcatcher,fdw4jge,t3_en1aez,1578754960.0,I really think we should appreciate Happy Face/Dreamcatcher Company in moments like these. They are constantly investing in the girls instead of throwing them in the basement because they haven't won. They got Siyeon two very big tv show appearances which hugely improved her profile and the King's Raid collab brought in a ton of new fans. I'm constantly grateful for their dedication to our girls.
