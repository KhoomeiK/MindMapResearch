bestof,ffsvjgj,t1_ffsj116,1580194157.0,"Careful. Facts upset the circlejerk. Every pilot that I have talked to including myself believe they know what happened because many of us have made the same mistake and just been lucky enough to not have a hillside rush up underneath us. These aren’t shots in the dark. These are this guy’s peers gathering all the public evidence and telling you what happened because it’s obvious to professionals who live this shit.

Special VFR clearance (you’re a slow helo so we expect you to be able to avoid traffic and clouds) with a VIP who wanted to get somewhere. You don't disappoint VIPs at this stage in your career unless you absolutely have to. That's why you're making the big bucks you worked 20 years for, because you can get the job done when others wouldn't dare try. Did everything he could to avoid the fog (as seen on the radar) and just made a fatal error. Accidentally made his way into IMC (radio got quiet means the guy was flying instruments for his life and didn’t have time to talk) and CFIT (controlled flight into terrain) occurred because he was lost and a hillside jumped up. It’s sad, but this was no mechanical error. It’s unfortunate but it was definitely over soon. An upside down helo cooks off magnesium instantly (the bangs onlookers heard) like a hit battle tank so at least no one suffered.

Listen to pilots, not emotional redditors. We have been studying accident investigations and mishaps and this kind of flying since most of you were learning to walk. Many of us have post-undergrad degrees in these subjects along with thousands and thousands of hours of training and flying and debriefing. We spent the last few days talking to our friends who are aviation maintenance technicians and getting their opinion given the history of this aircraft and its components. At this point, the investigation is a technicality. The outcome is certain to everyone who has any idea what they are talking about and we mean no disrespect to anyone. If you start jabbering about markets, economics and price points I’m not gonna argue with you or say your full of shit. That’s childish and means you have no idea the amount of training and schooling true professionals go through just to get their FIRST job. I’m gonna listen to what you have to say because you are gonna catch evidence I didn’t even know meant anything. If I disagree, I disagree but I don’t pretend that means I’m right.

If this was mechanical error he would have said so on comms even at 1000 feet and landed. If it was severe, he would have attempted an autorotation but at that AGL (height above the actual ground) had no chance. There is no evidence YET that this was the case. At this moment, all evidence points to a great pilot who flew into fog, got lost and hit a mountain. But don’t take my word for it. Just wait 3 weeks and the NTSB will have it all in writing and I very well may be wrong, but this is what the facts point to at the moment.

Pilots are not in the habit of blaming one of our own before the investigation is concluded. That would be horrifyingly disrespectful but this one is cut and dry. Sorry if that offends you, but student pilots can outfly mechanical error with ease. This guy was a certified instrument flight instructor. He knew his aircraft well enough to teach already commercial pilots how to fly it blind. But mountainsides in a whiteout don’t care how good you are, which is why CFIT is so prominent even today. I personally lost a lifelong and military  pilot friend to CFiT before I had even got my bachelors and first paid gig and he had an instructor in the backseat. It’s sadly much more prominent in non commercial flights than many believe. 

He did not change his transponder. He did not send out a mayday. That’s what you do when you are vfr and you find yourself unable to see. This man was 'scudrunning' as we call it (flying low down the freeway to get through the mountains in shit vis) and ended up ""in the goo"" so quickly that he had no time to react. He most likely instinctively started a climbing turn, which in a white out will absolutely disorient you if you aren't 100% on instruments. He arrested the ascent and began a turn to the left to get out of the blindness and head for lower ground features because he had such a busy LA center above him. It was his only option. Being shore fog, it probably only got worse so he looked down at his instruments to fly out of there, but ran out of time. Helicopters have a much smaller flight envelope than fixed wing aircraft. His ears told him he was in a climbing right turn so he lowered collective and pulled left on the cyclic and the chopper was on it's left side and plummeting downward before he could blink. He was a pro who had multiple chances to land at Van Nuys and call it a day and he made the wrong move. Sorry but there it all is."

worldnews,ffslv29,t1_ffqvt0i,1580184967.0,It’s almost like your state having obscene taxes makes for better schools where they have no taxes and shit schools. You can talk all the smack you want about them being dumb because of it but your state is falling apart financially and theirs is prospering so I wouldn't pad your ego for too long. You don’t need a bachelors in history and a masters in finance to fix a tractor and invest in a new grain silo.
