GenderCritical,ffcdzy0,t3_esm08f,1579797421.0,They've really ruined this poor child. Legal mutilation is what it is.
college,feiab09,t3_ep1or8,1579133827.0,"Most dining halls have a buffet style set-up. Watch your portions and eat healthy foods. Salad, veggies, fruits, an occasional desert. You can always have snacks in your room also!"
serialkillers,fehfi1n,t1_fed0e5n,1579115468.0,"I'd agree simply because their spree occurred during the age of technology. The internet helped create mass hysteria. I feel like in the 20th century, it was hard to create wide-spread news with any type of social media/internet."
GenderCritical,fdlp7q2,t3_eljr36,1578529207.0,"The definition of lesbian is a biological female that is sexually and romantically attracted to other biological females. Anything else is someone who is bisexual or pansexual. I will never be attracted to males, penis, or the male body period. Even if a male has had gender affirming surgery, there will always be something ""off"" about them that will not match an authentic female. The cotton ceiling is what peaked me with trans rights."
GenderCritical,fdfqfxr,t3_el308u,1578367728.0,I'm disturbed at the number of therapists that don't stay neutral when meeting with their clients.
college,fcy4j35,t1_fcy3oof,1578074648.0,"If it were me in this situation, I think I would try that route. If you end up matriculating to U of I, I would recommend scheduling a meeting with an academic advisor if possible. I know that school is huge, but there has to be someone who can give you advice on how to move forward and hopefully get into the business school at some point. Good luck!"
college,fcy3iho,t3_ejeuio,1578074284.0,"Is it possible to start with the different major at U of I, have a couple stellar semesters, then apply for the business school again as a Sophomore?"
intermittentfasting,fcy0a8j,t3_ejfz7x,1578072885.0,Good luck! You can do it!
childfree,fcqnsxl,t3_eih2fd,1577889243.0,"To be fair, my mom didn't get on welfare until I was 11. She had a good paying middle-class job, but was laid off. Took years to bounce back. I know some people purposely abuse the system, but most don't and were just down on their luck."
AskReddit,fcp731u,t3_eic8yl,1577852642.0,"I don't take it. It's corny, but everything happens for a reason. If I went back and changed the trajectory of my life, I would be somewhere totally different and wouldn't have my current friends, degrees, car, and job.  I don't know if things would be better or worse, but they would be different in an overwhelming way."
ApplyingToCollege,fcp0b5d,t3_eia9a3,1577846578.0,"Hopefully in the future, these ""old money"" ivy institutions will become less popular and not put on a pedestal. There are so many better institutions that get overlooked due to not being ""big name"" in the collegiate world. Sorry you had this experience, but I'm not surprised unfortunately."
college,fcowvlv,t3_ei5vdu,1577843789.0,"It's not good to get a bachelor's degree in just anything, rack up student loan debt, and then find yourself in a position where you won't have a lucrative career. Take some time to work and find out what your passions are. Take aptitude tests. Build up some work history. Please do not aimlessly get a degree just to have it."
college,fcowkvc,t3_eiaewf,1577843551.0,"I was a transfer student twice and went to three different colleges. It took 6 years to finish my bachelor's while people I graduated HS with finished in 4. I felt like a failure for sure. Everyone's life does not move at the same pace, remember that. You are young enough still where you won't stick out like a sore thumb. Imagine how non-traditional students in their 40s or 50s feel. Trust the process."
demisexuality,fcow75n,t3_eibha4,1577843252.0,"As a demisexual, I do have sexual desire when I'm not attracted to someone, but it's in general and not aimed at a particular person. Like an itch that needs to be scratched, hence masturbation. When I become sexually attracted to someone, then the sexual desire is aimed at that person. I hope that made sense. But no two demisexuals are the same. I only speak for myself."
socialskills,fcotlb9,t3_ei8i4s,1577841195.0,I'm fine with being in the house sober and safe to bring in the new decade.
TwoXChromosomes,fcoq2le,t3_ei9axq,1577838547.0,"So sorry to hear you went through this. 2019 was probably the best year of this decade for me. One good year out of nine. If I discussed all the adversity I faced this decade, I'd have a whole essay. Sending you positive vibes and hoping the new year and decade treats you and your child well and brings healing."
firstimpression,fcok38h,t1_fcojr6k,1577834220.0,"Well, I got the college part right lol! Good luck to you!"
childfree,fcojrdy,t1_fcoabp0,1577833980.0,Not true. My mom was able to claim me while I was in college and I did live on-campus.
firstimpression,fcoj998,t3_ei8onu,1577833601.0,In college as a social work major. 4/20 friendly and does occasional pub crawls.

GenderCritical,fcnyo9d,t3_ei4v9v,1577820990.0,Standing there looking like Taye Diggs
unpopularopinion,fcko1bo,t3_ehlfpr,1577729489.0,"""Say, what's in this drink?"" - I interpreted that as meaning she thought the drink tasted strong and probably wondered what type of alcohol was in it. I did not think of roofies, which probably didn't even exist back then."
GenderCritical,fckcmy3,t3_ehgt71,1577722329.0,"It's crazy because during my grad program, we learned about IRB (Institutional Review Board), research involving human subjects, etc. They clearly state that children, pregnant women, and prisoners have diminished autonomy. It's very difficult to get research approved involving people from those particular groups. The fact that children are allowed to transition is so bizarre to me and goes against everything the medical and research world stands for."
AskReddit,fcik72r,t1_fcgs3hf,1577663930.0,"I've driven high on weed and almost crashed. Took me about an hour to get home (15 minute drive typically). I've driven drunk also unfortunately, and both were bad!"
southpark,fcfigmi,t3_eguyb0,1577630328.0,"Out of the first 3 seasons, season 2 is the worst for me. Still watchable though. I think Tom's Rhinoplasty has to be my favorite old school episode."
southpark,fcfi3nl,t1_fcc8vmi,1577630203.0,"Yes, it's annoying when I'm re-watching episodes and realize I have to watch the whole season, otherwise it doesn't make sense."
agedlikemilk,fc9xhuj,t3_egt9fe,1577559667.0,Oof.
childfree,fc9v434,t3_egr1tv,1577558657.0, I'm disgusted a parent would even do this!
agedlikemilk,fc4p6pw,t1_fc08dq6,1577423511.0,"I agree. I think this is one tragedy I'll never find funny ever. Mind you, I have an extremely dark sense of humor."
