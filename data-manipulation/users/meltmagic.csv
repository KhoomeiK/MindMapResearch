I don't think you should ever back down on your dreams of marriage and having a family. It's obvious you had talked about this in the past with your partner and they have now changed their minds on this. It's heartbreaking that he would accuse you of some form of trickery into getting pregnant the second time - all contraception is not full proof and he should read about it like a normal person...

I was with my ex for 9 years, and like you, we spoke of marriage and children, but it got to a point where it was literally going nowhere and my dreams were not going to be fulfilled. I ended up starting the conversation that led to us breaking up. I took the risk that it may take years to find someone else, though I felt that I couldn't remain trapped in a relationship, where everything we had spoken about prior, just wasn't going to happen. I am now in a better relationship with a new partner.

It's always a hard decision thinking about breaking up. You need to weigh up love and if you can see a good future with that person. Don't compromise your own happiness just because you've had years with this person. Make sure they add to your happiness and you want them there for your journey."

On one hand, this married woman had an affair on her own accord, so is that any of your business? They made that choice and that's on them for any consequences.

On the other hand, it looks like your fiancé would question your belief in marriage and the sanctity of it. If you could do that with a married woman, is this something that could happen in your own marriage?

Probably just a decision made in the moment for fun, though it's made your fiancé question the morals and values you hold."
