AskReddit,fdv1ixr,t1_fdtu2jy,1578742059.0,I was just thinking about watching this movie and then I saw this comment. Taking that as a sign from the universe that I should watch it. :)
aww,fdu9zdc,t1_fdsslln,1578730147.0,Don't understand this reference...
aww,fdu9w1n,t1_fdshcg7,1578730100.0, I mean it's 'cracker' but I thought I should spell it with the aussie accent in mind.
aww,fdu9hii,t1_fdsorha,1578729896.0,I'm an Australian and I say that all the time just because it's fun to say. I know most aussies don't talk that way I was just having a bit of fun. Didn't mean to offend.

unpopularopinion,fdqojp6,t1_fdqo6x6,1578671481.0,Yes absolutely.
unpopularopinion,fdqoi1a,t1_fdqnzl4,1578671451.0,"No but also, spiritually has become a much bigger thing so a lot of people who aren't religious still believe in a bigger meaning."

FindTheSniper,fdqnjo7,t3_emqr7b,1578670854.0,Somehow that spider doesn't look real. It looks like it's printed on the box.
unpopularopinion,fdqn436,t1_fdqmsd6,1578670580.0,"But I mean it's nothing beyond that. We just ended up here and so we can exist here for a while but there was no divine plan behind life and existence, nor is there one after it."
AskReddit,fdqme54,t3_ems8jp,1578670110.0,"The bliss of being able to live their lives without so much information being shoved at them from all directions and without constantly being made to feel inadequate by what they see in the media.
We already experience that now but it's only gonna get worse."
AskReddit,fdqltu6,t3_ems9lj,1578669743.0,"I like going to my favourite cafe and sit there while I journal or draw or do something creative and drink a good cuppa coffee. Or, for a different approach I put on emotional songs and cry my eyes out until I'm out of tears and drained of emotions. It sounds silly but anytime I do this, I get to a point where I become numb and then after that point I start to feel better. It weirdly works."
AskReddit,fdqlc0u,t3_emjpvj,1578669423.0,"What's green and has wheels?

Grass.

I lied about the wheels."
AmItheAsshole,fdqj411,t3_emimf3,1578667925.0,NTA - that's honestly such a sweet and thoughtful thing and I'd be really grateful if my husband did that. But everyone's different and maybe she's just not comfortable with that for some reason? Maybe just talk to her and ask her to explain why it's a problem for her.

AskReddit,fdkh4o3,t1_fdjxtbc,1578503762.0,I always thought it was the actual belly too. I feel like most kids probably think this because that's what adults tell you anyway.
aww,fdkgoat,t1_fdk9wtc,1578503485.0,Agreed!
Discussion,fdkfq55,t3_elui1b,1578502906.0,Surprisingly only once.
unpopularopinion,fdjxunz,t3_elnciv,1578490911.0,"Totally agree. I honestly don't know much about politics and world issues in general. It's not even that I don't care but there is just so much going on and I don't know what to think or believe or do... I don't know it's just a lot to comprehend sometimes. So I don't talk about this stuff. But sometimes if I don't know about political issues in my country, people seem to look down on me for that. I used to feel ashamed of not knowing but now I realise it's fine. I don't need to know everything."
FindTheSniper,fdek2ht,t1_fdedeaj,1578340691.0,I did the same.
AskReddit,fdeaofg,t1_fde7qq9,1578334883.0,OK give me Hamm on 5 and hold the Mayo.
AskReddit,fd0djt6,t3_ejogd0,1578117293.0,"Not going out and being social on weekends or staying home during vacations instead of going on a holiday. It's not exactly 'socially unacceptable' but people always seem almost personally attacked over it. I'm someone who just loves being home. I'm not a people person and I don't like traveling so when I have work vacations I stay home and chill. Its what makes me happy but every single time when people ask, 'where are you going in the time off?' and I say nowhere, I get shit for it. People tell me it's so sad or that I have to go somewhere, I can't just stay home. It just bugs me that people try to tell you what to do. Just because it's something that makes you happy doesn't mean I have to do it."
AskReddit,fd0brfc,t1_fczi6na,1578116578.0,"I think because no one actually cares. It annoys me that people even ask sometimes because they don't actually care about the answer they're just asking because they think they're supposed to. And the worst is the ones who answer for you, 'how are you? Good? Good.' well why ask if you're gonna fill in the answer yourself?"
