SuicideWatch,fesiemv,t1_fes8dsn,1579365495.0,I’m so sorry
SuicideWatch,femoe3v,t1_femeqhm,1579264645.0,You are right.
SuicideWatch,femocbl,t1_feludkk,1579264594.0,"I’m sorry that your life is like that. I don’t believe that anyone could just get over it, especially within a couple of years. People show their care after you die and experience many emotions."
SuicideWatch,femoa3w,t1_felsbi1,1579264532.0,Completely
SuicideWatch,femo9r4,t1_felnig4,1579264521.0,"Exactly, I always wished I could run away or get out into a coma so I wasn’t truly “gone,” and people wouldn’t feel so guilty or even take their own lives because of me."
SuicideWatch,femo8ba,t1_feln9gw,1579264479.0,I’m so sorry. I’m glad you have parents that care but stating it that way is a horrible thing to think about.
SuicideWatch,femo76q,t1_felmv8b,1579264447.0,"Exactly. I feel the same way too, I am my mother’s only son and she’s told me she wanted a boy."
SuicideWatch,femo699,t1_fellge9,1579264421.0,"I understand. I don’t know how most people would think. I understand the spire thing, though; sometimes I feel like “maybe I should push through despite not wanting to.”"
SuicideWatch,femo4vv,t1_felux0y,1579264380.0,I agree with you.
SuicideWatch,femo41e,t1_fem0e8n,1579264354.0,"I’m sorry your family is like that towards you. I’m glad you feel that way though, wherein no one feels a certain way about you, you feel it about you."
SuicideWatch,femo295,t1_fem0wxs,1579264301.0,I understand completely.
SuicideWatch,femo1ue,t1_fem2yyb,1579264289.0,That’s right. I’m glad you have that.
SuicideWatch,femo1e9,t1_fem95mx,1579264277.0,"Although there is nothing there, it is a new sub. Hopefully you will recruit people for a good sub."
SuicideWatch,femo00i,t1_femi3ql,1579264237.0,Me too.
SuicideWatch,femnzsv,t1_femj7xy,1579264231.0,Thank you for your insightful words.
SuicideWatch,feljrtc,t1_feld3x6,1579223861.0,I’m so sorry you feel this way.
SuicideWatch,feljr6b,t1_felevlu,1579223848.0,"I am so sorry. It does suck because many people don’t understand. I confine in many friends and they don’t attempt to console me or comfort me. But some do. 

I’m glad you have your son, although I’m sorry it makes you feel more depressed. I hope he helps keep you alive."
SuicideWatch,feljni0,t1_felfdgc,1579223777.0,"I’m glad you have something keeping you alive. I understand how you feel, but I can assure you that people probably don’t feel that way."
SuicideWatch,felj0s0,t1_felhqja,1579223341.0,Sorry to hear that.
SuicideWatch,fel64vw,t1_fel4v9i,1579214878.0,Me too.
SuicideWatch,fel647l,t1_fel45r5,1579214867.0,I understand.
SuicideWatch,fel63hy,t1_fel44gl,1579214854.0,"I understand only caring about a specific person or people. I know certain people I’m around, like my peers, for example, would be effected, but fuck them because most of them either don’t talk to me or treat me like shit. 

I act happy too, or at least, towards my friends. They know how sad I am but I still manage to make them laugh."
SuicideWatch,fel5vrr,t1_fel1enp,1579214725.0,Maybe. I’m sorry you feel that way. I wish I could help you.
SuicideWatch,fel28aq,t1_fel25qh,1579212474.0,Wow... I am so sorry for your loss.
SuicideWatch,fel13sf,t1_fel100o,1579211792.0,"I think about that quite a bit, and how that would be the deciding factor if I took my life or not"
SuicideWatch,fel0vro,t1_fel0rdo,1579211660.0,"Don’t be sorry. I can’t say I feel the same way, but it’s not the first time I’ve heard it, and I understand where you’re coming from. 
Who knows? People would know. It would probably be on the news, mentioned that you wrote this comment before your death. I hope you don’t, though."
SuicideWatch,fel0n8v,t1_fekx5no,1579211521.0,"I understand, but some people wouldn’t."
SuicideWatch,fel0mfg,t1_fekot2a,1579211508.0,"I know you don’t want pity or sympathy, and I’m not giving you that. But I’m sorry your parents had to be like that. I know they may not care but many others probably would, like people on this sub. 
Anyways, I wish you had the life you seemingly deserve, one that’s better than this."
SuicideWatch,fel0hk8,t1_fekqyx1,1579211428.0,"Yep, I understand completely. If I had no one care it would make things 100% more easy."
SuicideWatch,fel0f43,t1_fekzz7l,1579211388.0,"I’m sorry that you don’t have any loved ones. And I must say, people in the sub care whether they show it or not. None of us want fellow members to die."
SuicideWatch,fekcta0,t1_fekcfbh,1579197360.0,I understand completely.
