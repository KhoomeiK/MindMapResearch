However! The math still works. If you wanted to get the Napier to hit 200, you'd have to give it 90*(200/100)^3 = 720 Hp. Conversely, the F40 only needs 471*(100/200)^3 = 59 Hp to hit 100 mph."

So in this really crude example, you need an extra 33 Hp to get from 100 to 110 mph, but you need an extra 126 Hp to get from 200 to 210 and that's AFTER the 700 Hp increase just to get to 200 mph."

In college, an average game has 72 plays and a 3 hour 24 minute run time. Despite the lack of a two minute warning, they stop the clock on every first down, hence the additional plays and run time.

atheism,fdxa76b,t3_ena9nb,1578766850.0,"""Before the big bang"" is not really a concept that can be defined. The big bang was the rapid expansion of spacetime, not just space. Since physics in a nutshell is just a description of how energy evolves within our universe, we have literally no tools for describing what is or isn't outside (or before) our universe.


That doesn't mean there isn't an extra-universal concept of time, but it means any idea we have of time before our universe is based on the assumption that it behaves the same as within our universe. But is that a good assumption? We already know that time is local and varies greatly depending on perspective (i.e. saying two events occurred simultaneously means less and less the further apart those events occur). Plus, we don't really have any idea why, unlike the three space dimensions, we can only travel through time in one direction. We also don't know why there is only one time dimension (or three space dimensions for that matter). It's possible that these facts are true within our universe, but not outside of it.


So I don't know and anyone that claims to know is basing their opinion on A LOT of unverifiable assumptions. That doesn't mean it's not worth thinking about; there are entire fields of physics based around it.

1) You're probably going to end up having to taxi your siblings around sometimes anyways so why not take a free car for it? 


2) A car is a major hassle when you're in college because you'd have to hold a job down to pay for it, plus parking is INSANE (it was $350/semester at my school 6 years ago), plus it'll get ruined by door dings and people just straight up hitting it while parked in the college lot (again, speaking from experience here).

I currently own a car from 2000 and a car from 1996 and I'm basically doing SOMETHING every weekend to keep then driving. 


Why not negotiate their terms here. Tell them you'll pay for your own gas, but that you should receive some amount of gas money for driving your siblings around. Then ask if you can have the car for realzies when you graduate college.

They literally fought us to redesign our product to survive a failure condition that, if present, will have already resulted in a catastrophic flight failure (imagine a requirement that your car's blinkers must work in the event your car explodes).

They have enough product leftover from shuttle for a few flights and have been fighting us tooth and nail to just make more of that design, but like you said, we can't even get parts to make that design anymore.

I too have started working on commercial and non-NASA space programs and it does get a lot better. In the time it's taken us to not agree on requirements with NASA, we've completed dev, qual, and a test fire with a similar product with a different customer. I have no doubt we'll get there with NASA, but there's a reason SLS is going to be 5-10X more expensive than a Falcon Heavy and it's not because the materials cost more."

I worked some of that stuff earlier in my career, but other things now and there's a definite coolness factor to working with NASA even if it isn't exactly as cutting edge as I would have imagined when I was younger. Although that program specifically is VERY risk averse (for good reason)."

WhitePeopleTwitter,fdesy7x,t3_ekvuw3,1578345950.0,"Fun fact! As of March 2019, the Trump administration had already exceeded the number of drone strikes conducted under Obama by 365 (2,243 by Trump vs. 1,878 by Obama). He also did this after revoking the order to keep track of and report the number of civilian casualties caused by those attacks. [Source.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47480207)

And despite majority support for targeted drone killings under Obama and still to this day, people were very much [concerned](https://www.npr.org/2016/02/23/467670436/report-obama-administration-makes-no-progress-on-drone-program-transparency) [with](https://www.npr.org/2016/07/01/484381660/white-house-documents-number-of-civilians-killed-in-u-s-drone-strikes) [Obama's](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/03/15/us-drones-pakistan/1990825/) [egregious](https://www.salon.com/2011/08/12/pakistan_drones_children/) [use](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/02/10/274707917/u-s-citizen-may-be-targeted-with-drone-strike-reports) of [drone](https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/rights-groups-demand-more-details-on-us-global-drone-strikes/3358998.html) [strikes](https://bakersfieldnow.com/news/nation-world/obama-4-americans-killed-since-2009-in-us-drone-strikes-11-17-2015), which would be obvious to anyone not engrossed exclusively in right wing media, but they're even more upset at the 4X increase in the rate of drone strikes under Trump.

technology,fda3jg9,t1_fd9eicn,1578241250.0,"The problem isn't even necessarily that things are outdated. It's that every business group gets to decide what software systems they prefer and nothing is integrated. 
The quality group wants this program to track MRB. CM wants their own system for data management plus a separate system specifically for software management. Manufacturing prefers a different system for creating shop instructions and logging test results, but a separate incompatible system for data collection, and fuck it, calibration will be its own thing too. Program office wants some specific system for managing budgets and, surprise!, this completely incompatible system for managing schedules. But don't worry, neither is compatible with project engineering's system for managing tasks nor are they compatible with the system contract managers use for making payments. Systems engineering prefers one system for managing models and a different incompatible system for managing requirements. 
PLUS there's job specific systems for things like CMM programming, CNC programming, parallel computing servers, various different types of analysis tools.
And that doesn't even scratch the surface on the overhead stuff like collaboration tools (i.e. sharepoint, one note, etc), time keeping, HR, training, payroll, IT, legal, etc.

None of these systems are outdated on their own; many are state of the art. They're just highly customized to perform a specific function with absolutely no thought put into integration with other systems that businesses will inevitably use along side them. And no, adding an ""export to [insert file type]"" function is not integration!"
