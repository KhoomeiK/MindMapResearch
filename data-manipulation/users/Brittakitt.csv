AskReddit,ff94gk9,t1_ff8y5pt,1579704614.0,This one works for me! I really am interested in everything everyone has to say. I see other people as open books with stories I've never heard. It makes it really easy to converse.
pics,ff2ra46,t1_ff2r3s5,1579520561.0,Not if the abusive partner is sitting right there with them while they talk to the doctor. Most abusive partners would not let their partners go to appointments alone.
puppy101,fetrz2y,t1_fetrci9,1579379280.0,"So far their only interaction is the wrestling. Sometimes the puppy will yelp, or the kitten will let out a... Angery meow? When one of them makes an upset sound, the other generally backs off, but it just seems so intense! If I put the puppy in the kennel and close the door so the cat cant go in there, he gets mad at ME and tries to tackle me. He is otherwise a really sweet cat and only acts out that way when I stop him from getting to the puppy. I am so confused! 

Like it is full on nipping, claws out fighting, but it seems like they're having fun?"
classicwow,fephrc6,t3_eq3jsc,1579320820.0,Mind controlling people in there is great.
Incendius,feof3tr,t1_fenuu48,1579299250.0,"I mean pvp is fine and all, but having rotating groups that camp every 50+zone while they wait on their queues is pretty annoying. Most of the alliance there are low and dont even stand a chance fighting back."
classicwow,fedt25f,t1_feccu4t,1579019288.0,A lot of horde on my server are like this too. I roam the world constantly and had to leave the server discord because they kept tagging me to shit talk if I died OR if I killed them. I cant understand why people dont pvp and just leave it at that.
wholesomememes,fed2tig,t1_fed2ppk,1578995952.0,"As I said in my other comment, it isnt a question that has a proper answer. There isnt some magical solution to it. It's an impossible scenario."
wholesomememes,fed2jiq,t1_fec6yew,1578995535.0,"Since you deleted your other comment, here was my response. 

There isnt answer to it and you know that. You need to deal with whatever makes you so worried about that happening. The equivalent would be if I stopped talking to all men because I was scared of being raped and murdered. I dont do that though, because even though statistically plenty of women will be assaulted in their lives (I'm one of them), I'm not going to live in fear of something that probably wont happen again. You're creating ridiculous scenarios that have no answers and that's why you arent getting answers."
wholesomememes,fec7iuh,t1_fec6yew,1578967999.0,Literally nobody I know has ever had that happen. Has anybody you know ever had that happen?... Seems more like you're crippling yourself over a fear of something that .001% of the population will ever experience.
wholesomememes,febmp2e,t1_febh77k,1578960488.0,"Then who cares what they think? Limit contact with them and save yourself the mental hassle of worrying about them. If they're assholes, THEY are the problem, not you. Don't give them more thought than they deserve."
TwoXChromosomes,fdq5r2m,t1_fdpsqfa,1578656072.0,Saving this for later
tippytaps,fdp43p2,t3_emadkv,1578619534.0,My old man dog used to do this. We called it the cha-cha!
puppy101,fdha7xm,t1_fdha419,1578418725.0,Greedy for flavors 😂😂 I've never heard anything more accurate in relation to a puppy.
puppy101,fdfrxfa,t1_fdfrrhl,1578368715.0,"She will definitely grow out of it! Mine was a little faster because I have an older dog she adores, so she takes a lot of cues from him. Your pup will grow out of it in time."
puppy101,fdfrnoq,t1_fdfr7mw,1578368534.0,"How old is your baby? Mine was like that too, and I know the whining and barking was out of love, but it was still annoying. She is around 16 weeks now and has mostly grown out of that neurotic need to be near me. Just remember that for them, in nature, being alone means that they could die. They arent trying to be brats, they just gotta learn that being away from us is okay!"
puppy101,fcyy5sx,t1_fcyx4xm,1578089672.0,They seriously are. I live in exhausted fear that she'll be this bratty at 100 lbs.
puppy101,fcyrj8h,t1_fcyr4z2,1578085567.0,"She just hit 16 weeks old. Sometimes she can be so snuggly and sweet, but sometimes she is a straight up brat. It isnt for a lack of training either. We have a ton of tiny training sessions throughout the day, but apparently nothing is good enough to override the sweet allure of trying not to let her brother drink..."
puppy101,fcyr5vd,t1_fcyo5z0,1578085364.0,"She gets lots of naps, so I dont think shes overtired. I dont have anyone who can watch her for me, but I think next week she is going to go stay at daycare for a few days so I can destress some."
puppy101,fcyr0um,t1_fcyqnzu,1578085289.0,"My older boy is the nicest dog ever, unfortunately so in this situation. She wont listen to no yet. If I see her going to bother him, I go get in the way or remove her from the situation. If I just block her, she has a full on theatrics filled tantrum because he is drinking without her intervention. This includes nibbling at my toes and screaming like someone is hurting her."
puppy101,fcs0rhn,t3_eildpx,1577909602.0,"My normally amazingly polite boy is also struggling to adapt to the puppy. In his defense though, she is unintentionally a bitch to him with her puppy ways. I dont have any advice, I just wanted to let you know you're not alone in this."
classicwow,fcnabsk,t3_ehy7up,1577807277.0,"Idk what server you're on, but if you're by some miracle on Incendius as alliance, I'd love to help teach you stuff."
classicwow,fcn902l,t1_fcjmnpe,1577806359.0,"If you ever feel like transferring, I'd love some new friends on Incendius! The people I started with bailed too, so I know those feels."
puppy101,fclpyii,t3_ehsyfu,1577753633.0,"I'm positive I've just been lucky so far, but every animal I've ever owned has been free fed and I've never had an overweight animal. The other people in this thread have amazing advice and reasons not to free feed, but it also isnt the end of the world if it seems to be working for you. Just measure the food and it doesn't matter how long they take to eat it."
puppy101,fcljcmo,t1_fclj9z6,1577749140.0,They're just as nasty as they sound too! But man they are like puppy crack. Good luck!! :)
puppy101,fclcmjx,t3_ehsorz,1577744722.0,"Mine really likes cow ears, duck feet, and beef trachea. All sorts of nasty chews like that."
nottheonion,fcez8ax,t1_fccuxr6,1577625105.0,"Maybe it doesn't matter in the grand scheme, sure! None of us have ever truly mattered in the grand scheme though. The universe is big and we are very small, that isnt new. What does matter is the effect you have on the people and animals around you. As long as you strive to make the creatures you encounter happy and healthy, that DOES matter. There are billions of people living with that mindset. There is good out there. Look for the helpers. Be the helper. You are doing alright. 

If you are serious about the counselor, I hope you find one. If you just need someone to listen sometimes when life has you down, my DMs are always open."
dogswithjobs,fc9h0az,t1_fc9ejpj,1577552546.0,"Thank you so much for replying and letting us know. It means a LOT. Ive thought about you sporadically for the past few days and was desperately hoping you're still here. 

I'm so happy that you told them what you were feeling and that you had your best friend with you Sunday. I know it had to be very relieving for him to know that you trust him enough to confide  that in him. I'm sure it wasnt an easy conversation for you to have. 

You're right that there could be another storm, but for now, celebrate that you're riding this one out. You're kicking this storm's ass! I know I'm just an internet stranger, but I am so, so proud of you. 

Please do message me in the future, I will always love to hear from you. Whether it's things to celebrate like today, or if you're feeling bad, I will always love to hear from you."
puppy101,fc6skzx,t1_fc6s3ea,1577488417.0,"I have around 10 bags of different kinds of chews to keep mine occupied. Since there are so many different kinds, she never gets bored and always goes for those. We have cow ears, pig noses, chicken feet, duck feet, cow trachea, dried pumpkin chews, sweet potato sticks, puppy chew rings, some little alligator chews that I freeze peanut butter in, and a bunch of different textured bones and toys. You should also be training the ""leave it"" command. Every time you see your puppy going for something, you tell them to leave it, and reward when they look away from it. It will take a while and some serious persistence, but your puppy will get it as long as you stick with it."
puppy101,fc6rg8g,t3_egi13e,1577487590.0,"You said you let him nibble on your hand? I think that could be confusing him. It might be easier if you dont let him do that and yelp every time he puts his mouth on you. You need to yelp and become very boring for around 20 seconds, and eventually it will stop being fun for him. He should realize that using his mouth means the fun ends."
puppy101,fc6o5z2,t3_eg5z2s,1577485256.0,"When puppies that young growl and bark, it is just them trying to play or to communicate. It is the only way the know to get their point across! Much in the same way a human baby cries when they dont know how to communicate. A 9 week old puppy isnt being aggressive."
puppy101,fc42mwg,t1_fc42j7d,1577405009.0,"Lmao, it's like one of those cat toys with a string tied to a stick, but way bigger. Now that my girl is afraid of walks, it's the only way I can get her tired out. At least until this fear phase is worked through."
puppy101,fc3xd3h,t1_fc3x3x9,1577401062.0,"Hahah, that sounds very much like my boy when he was a baby. I'd highly recommend the flirt pole if you havent ever tried one. I wish I had known about them when he was a crazy baby. 15 minutes using it with my girl puppy and then giving her breakfast in a snuffle mat tires her out for a few hours. Rinse and repeat for a snack at lunch, and then again at bedtime. She spends most of her day asleep now."
puppy101,fc3wmtm,t1_fc3u70k,1577400522.0,"She is generally a surprisingly calm puppy! She is a little dumb, but calm. My boy dog was really smart and crazy as a puppy, but easy to train. I think she's definitely an easier puppy, but we'll see if I still share that sentiment when she is a big, dumb, rebellious teenager."
puppy101,fc3wfu9,t1_fc3va73,1577400379.0,You know those cat toys that are tied to a stick? It's like that but much larger. It seems my puppy will do anything to play with hers.
puppy101,fc30spq,t1_fc30nkh,1577378854.0,😂😂 That'd be just my luck.
puppy101,fc2ty2u,t3_efu0qy,1577373954.0,I'd invest in a good enzyme cleaner if I were you. I imagine thatd help more than bleach and be safer.
toastme,fc0auqi,t1_fbzmc66,1577285335.0,My dogs and cats got their presents too! They've had a really good morning thanks to folks like you ❤
puppy101,fbvwu6y,t3_edy2e9,1577137238.0,"I had to start crating my girl to finally house train her. We'd go out, and if she didnt potty before we went in, I'd put her in her crate for 15 minutes. Rinse and repeat. When she did go, I'd give her treats and praise. They dont want to potty in their crate, so her only potty option will be outside. The more they go inside, the more it reinforces that it's okay to go inside. This breaks that cycle."
