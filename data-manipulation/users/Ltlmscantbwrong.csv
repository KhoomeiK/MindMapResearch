TwoXChromosomes,fepgo02,t3_eq6f9b,1579320020.0,She needs to be reported to the medical board! Period! What if someone went in with cancer? Are they just supposed to pray it away? WTF.
medical,fefi0tk,t3_eovxc7,1579056737.0,Looks like nail fungus. There’s over-the-counter treatment available.
aww,fef664q,t3_eospjf,1579049111.0,So cute I can’t stand it!
medical,fef61qi,t3_eosijk,1579049028.0,It is indeed a plantar wart.

TwoXChromosomes,fe5wh9v,t3_emzm0n,1578876494.0,"It seriously blows my mind how many guys try to get out of wearing a condom and it blows my mind how many women will let them.  Chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV etc.  doesn’t give a shit if you’re on the pill. STDs are going to make themselves at home... inside anyone who lets them in. I can’t believe how many people get diagnosed with an STD and wonder how it could’ve happened to them.  And the scarier part is how many people have an STD and don’t even know it."
TwoXChromosomes,fe5usvz,t3_en1euo,1578875431.0,You rock! We need more people like you.  There’s been a few times where I would’ve appreciated someone helping me out.
TwoXChromosomes,fe4k452,t3_enp686,1578860193.0,Does your place of work have a no soliciting policy. Most places do.  Because this is soliciting and it’s also illegal any way you slice it.  Tell the police then have him trespassed from the area.
TwoXChromosomes,fe4jhk0,t3_enruzo,1578859951.0,You could ask her what he was wearing and compare it to something he packed to wear.
medical,fe328o9,t3_enixp6,1578845227.0,I agree. Post in r/AskDocs!!
