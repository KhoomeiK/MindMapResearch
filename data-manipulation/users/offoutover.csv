brooklynninenine,fg8a2mr,t1_fg7cdma,1580613597.0,My mom bought a Zip drive and discs (if that’s what they were called) but they never got used. Something about formatting so they just collected dust.
DesignPorn,fg2hqw8,t1_fg1rehj,1580445243.0,"This wasn’t kitsch at the time though. Baskets were a very functional everyday thing when the company started, got trendy in the 80’s and were a billion dollar company by 2000. Their baskets are incredibly well built but trends changed and no one wants baskets anymore. Their two main issues as a company was not branching out and diversifying and using the MML style of Avon to sell their products. I feel if they played things right they could’ve been an online type place that sells trendy/functional houseware but they’d still be in business."
army,fg1z5zu,t1_fg1dluv,1580435421.0,Most people don’t get deployed that much if at all. My last unit hadn’t deployed since 2007 and my current unit is ineligible to deploy for another 2 years or so. Of course there are always exceptions. What I’ve found really hard for people is disaster relief. A deployment can be planned for but natural disasters can’t so being out of school for 3-6 weeks or trying to figure out whose going to be picking your kid up from daycare while you’re out at the last second can be really challenging. The 2017 hurricane season really wore a lot of people thin.

cringepics,ffnarhl,t1_ffmtwwd,1580063802.0,The band is about to release a new album so maybe it's part of an Interscope marketing push.  It's been almost five years since that album was released so the record company would definitely be wanting to get people talking about Tame Impala  again.
WeWantPlates,ffmcuyr,t1_ffm5l0y,1580052566.0,It looks like a flower pot without the functionality of an actual flower pot. If this were an actual flower pot soup would be running out of the whole(s) in the bottom. Therefore it may be a bowl purposely meant for soup (since it’s also glazed) that just looks like a flower pot?

vinyl,fflhye9,t1_ffkf7bf,1580039929.0,I’m guessing reel to reel since it’s in the picture and it sounds like op chose it over the cassette deck. OP’s sentences are missing whole words and context.

todayilearned,ff7kw94,t1_ff6n7lt,1579651977.0,Isn’t there a difference in how it’s carried out?  As in being dropped to break the neck is one term and being strung up to suffocate is another?  I really don’t know but I feel like I heard that at some point in the past and have never known if that was bs or not.

vinyl,fef0vyg,t1_feedl1b,1579045562.0,They used to be quite common as free songs/promotional material inserted into magazines or they came in musical instrument instructional books to let you hear how the songs are supposed to be played.  I have a few from instrument books and then a promotional one from the 50's saying why you should replace all your 78's with 33's because of the improved sound quality.
