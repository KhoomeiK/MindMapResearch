Might have been Iranian trolls doing it, but badmouthing Iran after the assassination got you attacked on here that day."
worldnews,feb0fcn,t1_feaed07,1578954179.0,"It's a matter of perspective; Soleimani was basically the ""Mad Dog Mattis"" of Iran.  Very popular among their political right wingers.  I mean, how would the Taliban describe our top generals?  People from over there call Trump a terrorist all the time, as they have many of our presidents in the past.  Generals kill people and rain down terror upon populations for a living; it's in the job description."

worldnews,feasqr2,t1_feaiqp8,1578951891.0,"He might have just fallen backwards into a win, but the Iranians are pretty good at stomping down their own people when they get too uppity, so I'm not terribly optimistic."
worldnews,feaqfpb,t1_feahic7,1578951351.0,"It wasn't the assassination that got them fired up; quite the contrary.  Soleimani was viewed by many Iranians as a hero to the revolution, fighting Isis and trying to work out a deal with the Saudis.  No, what pissed them off was the downing of that airliner and then lying about it.  They've been using the fact that the US shot down that airliner years ago as fodder to discredit the USA as a menace, and now they've demonstrated the same menacing behavior.  They've exposed themselves as hypocrites, and their own people - the moderates at least - who may have supported the regime just got handed a dose of reality, which looks pretty ugly to them.  The regime lost a ton of credibility from among the elements that they need to stay in power.  That is where the renewed hope lies.  Trump may just fall backwards into a win here, but by no action of his own, other than the coincidence of creating circumstances that led Iran to make an horrible mistake in the fog of war, and then try to cover it up."
worldnews,feanrgn,t1_feah4sg,1578950661.0,I believe this analysis is spot-on.
worldnews,fean5hc,t1_feajp21,1578950474.0,"Yep.  they'll use the horses for big public events and stuff where crowd control may be necessary, but they're not expecting a riot or anything.  Carnivals, the county fair, street festivals and whatnot, they're pretty common to see during those kinds of things."
