seduction,ffgpjhy,t1_fffikcx,1579911800.0,"I think you should put an effort into the other parts of your life. That does not mean that you have to have a very important and time consuming side hobby but yes that you should be a versatile person with lots of experience and the ability to relate and bond with others.

You are trapped like many other humans on the 9-5 cycle and many men not only have to maintain their job and bodies but also perform and become interesting attractive persons.

Its difficult girl, it is. To make time to grow as a person and not only to survive/maintain.

> Maybe that’s a big downside. Not doing much during the work week other than just work and sleep ha

Would you settle for a man who only did that? Eventually you will find Somebody who likes you for who you are and settle with him... But interesting, intelligent, attractive men look to settle with interesting, intelligent, attractive women.

Work - gym - sleep life is good enough for some but not all.

You are at the right subreddit. You need to learn some inner game."
seduction,ffff9al,t1_ffcz007,1579882684.0,"For me it depends a lot on the conversation we are having at the dates and what do you bring to the table.

Are you an interesting person? Do you live a fun interesting life? What do you bring to the table (Besides sex)? Many hot girls are boring as fuck! 

When you dont bring anything else to the table but sex, men wont stay around for long."

On the start of my bachelor's we were all friends and the friend groups were very big and inclusive. By the start of the third year, more than half the people had dropped out (many due to economic problems) and the rest of us devolved into many many very small cliques. I saw colleagues trying to sabotage other classmates feeding them false answers or misleading tips in order to make them fail."

We have learnt to hussle and be ambitious and work very hard and yeah, compared to us the germans feel a bit infantile. But this hassle survival culture came out of fear and desperation. I am jealous of the germans. I wish I had the chance to enjoy my youth without the worries and sadness of my studying years. I always tell them that in university I did not feel like I had classmates but rivals and enemies."

>1) Germans are very hardworking:- I felt that this wasn't true especially among young people! 

That has been my experience as well. German are not long hour workers but sometimes (not always) can be efficient workers. 

I have found what you comment about young people specially true. I dont think they are lazy but I do think they are not very ambitious and that they are very content."

After so much change and challenge my perception of myself and who I am has changed so much I dont even know anymore. I am a blank canvas, for me to do what I want with it, and that is both reassuring and very scary.

You seem to know what you are talking about. One question. Are you pro mistery method or pro honesty (models) method?"
SubredditDrama,fejd4au,t1_feim3mx,1579168094.0,"The Imperium of Man as a faction is supposed to be a super over the top parody of fascism. They are scientificaly backwards and stuck in their ways, incredibly xenophobic, militaristic and religious fanatics. The life of the average Imperium Citizen is short, brutal and miserable.

It kinda misses the point when your lore and fiction is constantly trying to frame the Imperium as ""going super fascist is the only way mankind would have survived""."
askseddit,fei6sbu,t1_fei4iqb,1579131548.0,"I see this is the route of chosing challenge and disconfort.

I have a question to ask you then:


Dont you ever feel burned out or tired of the constant challenging and the constant setting up of new milestones?

I find myself sometimes daydreaming about chosing the easy route, the route that avoids introspection and evolution. And sometimes I choose it. I sometimes just want to settle for the warm feeling of the known path and the unchallenging task. How do you deal with what is essentialy burnout from being ""on"" all day every day?


Hopefully I make sense here"
