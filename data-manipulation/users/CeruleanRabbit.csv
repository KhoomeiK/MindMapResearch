Post in sex work reddits, they know better than we do."
RealEstate,ffnz8ng,t1_ffnwp2b,1580072546.0,"Google the pros and cons of DR. He’s got some very good advice for people who are terrible controlling their spending and some very bad advice on investing and money management. 

Debt is like alcohol. Some people can’t touch one drop. If you’re a debtaholic, DR is a godsend."

BDSMAdvice,ffnoid8,t1_ffm99zo,1580068573.0,I was rough on you but I don’t think you’re a bad person. You’re clearly trying to learn and improve. You take constructive criticism very well and that’s a wonderful and rare trait.
BDSMAdvice,ffnnw8j,t3_eu8s5z,1580068322.0,"Communicate with her.

BDSMAdvice,ffnmvgj,t3_eu9zeq,1580068030.0,"Don’t go to his place, go on a vanilla date first. Or better yet, several vanilla dates. Meet his friends and his momma. Then hanky spanky. 

But at least meet in public first."
BDSMAdvice,ffnmi5d,t3_euaece,1580067872.0,"You don’t need to become a sadist, you just need to assert yourself and demand respect as a gentledom."

BDSMAdvice,ffnlaso,t3_eua7pu,1580067514.0,"That’s a hard limit for me. My relationship is too precious to risk and I refuse to open the door to drama and disease. I’m definitely a monogamist who only thinks sharing is sexy as a fantasy we will never do in real life. I protect US first.

You have to decide for yourself if this is something you want or something that you’re being talked into. It’s ok for you to say no, and it’s not ok for him to wear you down or keep bringing it up if you’ve said no. It’s ok for you to think it’s interesting but to not want to do it. 

It’s ok if others do it, lots of people do. But a lot of people also don’t do it and for very good reasons."
