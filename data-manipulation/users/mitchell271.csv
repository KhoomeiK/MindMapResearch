Total prep time was ~45min total. I seared the sausages (so they didn't disintegrate while slicing them) while slicing and cleaning the leek. Then I cooked the leek in some butter while prepping the potatoes and sausage. Finally, laying the whole thing out, which doesn't take long once you get into a rhythm, 10min tops.

Definitely recommend doing it if you're cooking with someone, or with kids."
