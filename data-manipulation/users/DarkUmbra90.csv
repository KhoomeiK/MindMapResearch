Insurance,fgk7qu0,t1_fgk6z48,1580859300.0,I would keep both vehicles on the policy and ask for a temp plate. It covers all your bases and there's no question of coverage or legality.
Insurance,fgk4933,t1_fgk2me4,1580857156.0,"Yeah you don't just switch plates because then the police will see the plates are for another vehicle and that's even worse.

Why not just ask for a temp plate for the new car OP also the premium for both vehicles on the same day shouldn't be that much. I would also call your DMV to ask if you can remove the insurance from the vehicle if you don't turn in the plates. Here in NC doing that will get you a fine for having a lapse in coverage."

news,fggp95v,t3_eyd0mb,1580766581.0,Well this is great news.
Insurance,fgceyx9,t3_exsd34,1580671981.0,They won't sue you for paying out for an accident during a covered time. Unless you somehow are commiting fraud or misrepresenting they won't come after you for something like this. This is what insurance exists for. Now if you do want to nonrenew and look for another policy after this one you can. I would just recommend you open it before your current one expires so you don't have a laps in coverage. Also you might get points because of the accident that will follow and affect your insurance prices for 3-5 years depending on the company.

I mean I guess in some sense the whole Trump trade ""war"" thing added to it but it seems like some people from the US view China as backwards, stupid, cruel, and I guess uncivilized. They are not American so they are bad type of exclusionary thinking. You'll get people who say that this is because they eat dog, or cat, or different types of meat in a derogatory way. This thinking has always been here and it's just been exasperated by this issue. Then they lump as people of eastern descent as Chinese because of thier ignorance and fear of the situation. It's fucked up."
AskReddit,fg3yfml,t3_ewmszg,1580492332.0,"Dark Souls Remastered, I have played all Souls Borne type games and am pretty good at them. I bough DSR on release day and I played a stupid Deprived build. I just ran through everything with the Drake Sword and kept a massive hoard of souls so that I could make my character how I wanted later on the game. I had $150k in Souls and then when I got to New London Ruins I died in a room like a lot of ghosts. I thought no biggie just run to it get souls and continue on my way....

Then I got to the same room and 5 ft away from my souls I fucking died. I tried to scum it and turn off my PS4 right when I died so it don't ""notice"" but then we I started it back up I'm right there watching my death animation play with souls in sight. I got to pissed off I haven't gone back even though I love Dark Souls."
Insurance,fg3mm4i,t3_ewpilu,1580485076.0,"Let's start with #4 because it's the biggest question. You need an insurance agent/broker that is familiar with Commercial risks. Google Insurance Agents near me and start calling them. Begin the conversation with everything you just typed in the OP. They'll guide you and you will be thier baby through this.

As for actual coverage there's always what the Insurance Agent will recommend and offer vs what you will purchase. 

If who ever is building or renovating the building needs to have a Commercial General Liability Policy, Workers Comp Policy, and Builders Risk. The first two is so that if something happens it doesn't fall on you and is covered by some policy. The last one is so that if something happens to the building, I.E it burns down while work is being done but is not the builders fault, the building can still be finished and no one is left without a building a big pile of burnt materials. If you are not the owner of the building don't worry about this.

Then you as a company need a BOP (Business Owners Policy) which is a Commercial General Liability Policy and a Commercial Property Policy mixed together. The CGL will cover damages caused by your company by your work or negligence. The CPP will cover your company's property inside the building you are leasing if something happens to it as defined in the policy. You can also get a Commercial Contents Flood Policy if you want to cover the items in the event of a Flood. Then you need Workers Comp to cover if anything were to happen to your workers during the course of thier job that is related to thier job. 

That's where I would start: A BOP (Commercial General Liability Policy + Commercial Property Policy) & Workers Compensation Policy. There are many other coverages and policies that can be purchased but speak to an agent about that.

Cyber Liability, Identify Theft/Recovery on the GL, Employeers Practices Liability, Data Retrieval, etc.

Edit: Also do not skimp on the limits raise those to the max limits available because the price difference is usually negligible. 

I also forgot to mention an Umbrella Policy. That goes over your other policies and acts as Excess Coverage when the limits on the other policies are used up. This is in the millions of dollars of coverage area.

Edit 2: Also forgot to mention Commercial Auto Policy. If you are using any vehicles for the company i.e anything that is not going to the business office, running occasional errands, or your personal vehicle that is in no way used for the company. You didn't say what kind of business you will have but if you do delivery then that vehicle needs to be on a commercial Auto policy unless your personal auto policy allows it under it's business usage guidelines. Ask your agent about this."

As for recommendations what is your price range on  acceptable monthly rent?

For an okay house it's going to be hard to find anything below $900 - $1000 a month."
RealEstate,ffkctot,t3_eu1ch8,1580020665.0,"Here in NC lying that badly on a the sq footing will get you in really big fucking trouble. Getting sued and license suspended type of trouble. It's so bad that on our MLS we don't have exact numbers anymore you mainly see ranges. You're allowed a 5% square footing discrepancy but even then you don't want to get sued.

Here we cannot go by public records, the last listings sq ft, the tax record, or anything that is not your drawing if how you got that sq ft because the NCREC can ask for your drawing of the house. 

If I were you I would ask your Sellers Agent to see what they recommend and talk to a Real Estate Lawyer. If you went under contract for a 1300 Sq Ft house and now find out it's only 900 ft you could have some legal repercussions. 

Here in NC you can only include area that is connected to the HVAC system, easily accessible, and finished as SQ feet. Then in slopped rooms you can only count the ""area"" where the hight is atleast 5 ft as SQ feet."

Insurance,ffga19s,t1_ffg9e5a,1579901689.0,It might but it's hard to say because you didn't come in contact with thier vehicle. I would just wait to hear from your insurance company and have them investigate if a claim is opened. If you receive anything about being sued or the insurance company of the other person reaching out to your for payment contact your insurance company about it. If the other person's insurance company calls you just tell them what happened.
Insurance,ffg8ovz,t1_ffg7xvq,1579900859.0,"Then you didn't cause any damage. They swerved to avoid a collision and if they damaged thier vehicle they should put a claim against thier Collision coverage. If they don't have this Coverage they can put a claim on your policy but because there was no contact it's just he said/ she said and your company will err on your side. If thier claim against your policy is denied then I guess they can sue you. 

My advice would be to wait on your insurance company to call you and give your side of the statement. Tell the truth: You momentarily crossed into thier Lane and they swerved to avoid collision but there was no contact between the two vehicles."

AskReddit,fek68is,t3_epfjje,1579193468.0,"When I was a kid, around 10 years old, I was riding my bike with some friends in a line down a stone path. The stones were not directly next to each other and had gaps; this is important to remember. As I'm riding by bike I hear something so I turn my head to see what's behind me that I heard. It was just my friend saying something but in that moment I lost control and my wheel hit the edge of a stone. This caused me to fly through the air and land on the side of the path ahead of me. When I landed my forearm landed flat over the gap between two stones. Right when I landed my friend who was riding behind me didn't have enough time to slow down and ran over my arm. This pushing my bone down into the gap and bent the arm into an ""S"" shape. I immediately felt so much pain I don't remember being taken to my parents. I just remember screaming. I was taken to the Emergency Room where the doctors were surprised that the arm hadn't broken. They decided the best nonsurgical way to fix my arm would be to put it into a hydraulic press and slowly over hours press my arm back into a straight line while I was put under. I had a cast for a couple of months and then it went back to normal.


Other than that I had a bad degree burn on the same arm some years later after playing hide & week when I decided to hide under a recently parked car. I burned my forearm on a muffler then walk home crying to see what I can do to stop the pain. I decided to use tweezers to pick off the dead skin on top, clean it with water, pour alcohol on it which hurt bad, then I just put Neosporin and wrapped it up. My mother walked into the living room as I was finishing up and freaked out. 


One time when I was long boarding with with a friend we decided to go down a very steep hill. I wasn't too experienced in longboarding so I lost control when the speed got to be to fast for me. I hit a rock in the rock and flew. As I was in the air I remember thinking that I could either land on my face or use my hands to soften the impact. I had new expensive glasses so I wasn't going to break those so I landed on my hands. I closed my eyes then I felt my hands touch the asphalt and slide. I opened my eyes and didn't feel any pain but when I stood up my hand felt white hot. I looked behind me to see two small streaks of red where my hands were. I then looked at hands and saw the skin on my palms gone. It was red and bloody. There was skin hanging off the sides but I wasn't soft and wet, it was hard and crunchy. I then showed my friend who took me to his friends house near by where I knocked on the door and asked to use the bathroom. This guy didn't know me but let me in when he saw my hands. I tried to wash my hands but the moment water touched my exposed palms I almost passed out form the pain. I then mustered up all the courage I had and held them under the faucet for as long as I could. Then I tried to remove my hanging skin. I couldn't up snap or peel it off so I removed opening the door and asking the guy for some scissors so that I could cut the skin off. I said it so nonchalantly now that I think back on it but he must've been freaked out. Then when I cleaned myself a bit we went to another of my friends house who had a but more medical supplies. They told me I should put hydrogen peroxide on my hands and i had never heard of it at that point so I said okay. They emptied a bottle of the stuff into a bowl in the skin of thier bathroom. I remember it smelling terrible but decided they knew best. I dunked my hands fully into the bowl and immediate passed out. My friend caught me as I feel and then I immediately came back. I screamed. It was the single most painful thing I have ever experienced but atleast my hands stopped bleeding. I wrapped my hands up gauze and nonstick pads and continued with my day. I still have photos of my hands and bring it up from time to time to my wife who hates the story."

Insurance,fegv4zr,t1_fegli14,1579103229.0,"Also this accident will show up probably as a claim on the policy and a savy or caring Insurance agent will bring it up with your parents, as the policy holders, to ask how everything went.

For example: When I'm taking a payment or someone calls with a question I review the whole policy so verify everything is correct. This is when I would see an accident happened on X date with Y vehicle with Z driver. 

My advice is to come clean to your parents and face the punishment for driving when you weren't supposed to. If your parents policy pays for anything thier price may certainly go up and that's when they'll really notice.

Insurance,fegtj70,t3_ep1iao,1579102196.0,That's a Comprehensive Claim subject to your deductible. File police report and tell everyone who asked what happened. Might get and eyebrow raised and some questions but you should be fine if that's all that happened.

If you don't want repairs then just don't call the insurance company about this. Ask for new ID Cards if you can't print them yourself. Call the DMV and see how you can obtain a duplicate registration. 

As for ID theft call the 3 credit bureaus and ask for them to freeze your credit or see if they have offer credit monitoring services so that you can check if anything happens regarding your credit in the future."

caraccidents,fedl8gu,t3_eok59v,1579014296.0,"You can't open a policy in the future to cover an accident in the past. Don't try to because it's insurance fraud. 

Since you don't have collision coverage your options are very limited. 

1.You can wait for the insurance company contacts and divys out payment for everyone. The proportionality they are mentioning is that everyone won't get 100% of thier damage repaired/ repaid because the drunk driver has a set property damage limit on thier auto insurance policy and this accident will surely max it out. Everyone will get a % of this guy's Property Damage limit. The insurance company won't pay for more then this person's coverage. 

2. Pay for everything out of pocket and hope to get some money back. 

3. Research how to sue this person in Small claims court in your area. It's usually pretty simple. Just Google your county city and state small claims court requirements and see what it says. Then sue them and hope they have money because even if you win and get a judgement they could still have nothing to give. 

That's pretty much all you can do.
