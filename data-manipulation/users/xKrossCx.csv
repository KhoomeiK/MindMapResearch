flexibility,ffeacsz,t3_et50l1,1579841147.0,Yeah. Continue stretching. Flexibility is a long process. I actively stretched two sometimes 3 times 5 days a week and I could put my hands on the ground after About a year and a half. I’m not saying that’s the goal or that it will take you that long. Just my experience.

It’s being directed towards corporations. I’m not saying corporations are all bad.... but let’s be real! A vast majority of them seem are at the moment, bad. Low wages and no health care options (or options that are just outright stupid). It’s crazy... at some point our congressmen/women,representatives, and other lawmakers will be forced to recognize the terror that is gripping the bottom of our hierarchy, but for now? They’re content..."
xbox,fe2imva,t1_fdyr3mb,1578838757.0,"I remember when my dad got our Xbox modded. Not any aesthetic mods but it had every damn game known to man on it. This was back when blockbuster was out and we’d go rent one of the new games and download it to our Xbox. Rinse and repeat! It also had every emulator which amounted to like 10,000 old school games. It was sick as fuck! And when you wanted to swap to a new game you just hit both triggers and the two center buttons and you’d be at the main menu. I think my dad spent like 400 dollars to have some guy do the mods. I spent a lot of my childhood on that thing. Good memories."

You like the mechanics of league but understand you’re not going to go pro. All these other people don’t see it that way and just want to scream at you for whatever just happened. It’s not worth even having chat up. I’m not saying run it down mid as yummi but play the game your way and just play ranked."

tech,fcfx6bb,t1_fcffaw4,1577634556.0,"One of the most successful rocket companies also has billions in revenue. I think these posts are made to help get people clicking on SpaceX articles and websites to generate interest. The reason I think this way is because all of the hurdles we’d have to get over to utilize mars for all these things people think we can use mars for. 

Going to mars is different than colonizing mars. Of course we can make it to mars. 
Can we colonize Mars? I dont think so. 

Mars wobbles. Earth has a wobble as well but not near as drastic as mars’. Mars has an atmosphere that’s extremely thin. What is our plan for an atmosphere that is actually conducive to life? How do we plan on keeping those gases in Mars’ atmosphere when it’s gravitational pull is even less than earths (and earths gravity already isn’t enough to contain some gases). Mars has dust storms that shroud the entire planet; I think about the implications that has for solar farms. Not to mention radiation that routinely “sterilizes”. 

Also the largest active volcano in our solar system is on mars if I’m not mistaken. Oh and the average temperature on mars is -80 degrees Fahrenheit. Which decreases to -195 in winter apparently. For reference our South Pole hits that -80 mark in the winter months. This is so cold explorers have to warm the air before they can safely breath it without causing damage to there lungs. 

When I think about technological progression yes we have come a very long way in terms of understanding technology when I think back 20 years, but colonizing another planet? Thats beyond r/nextfuckinglevel"
