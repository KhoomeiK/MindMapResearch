depression,ffhtqpk,t3_etkvgj,1579953450.0,"Hey, just chiming in to say the whole ""dressed too masculine for people to like"" is absolutely fucking wrong. I personally adore girls who dress masculine, also don't take any notice to what this dude says, you're most likely incredibly pretty, what he was saying is you wasn't his type, which you shouldn't give any shits about! I use to think I looked gross, but since I started transitioning I've found myself to look so much prettier and feeling much more comfortable with my looks. The same transition stuff won't apply to you but the moral of the story is you will naturally change over time and I guarantee you'll learn to love yourself :)

Stay strong! \^\_\^"
