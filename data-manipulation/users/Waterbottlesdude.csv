AskReddit,fego56u,t1_fefucxt,1579098494.0,"Woah similar thing with me. It’s really hard to know what went wrong though. My parents are really kind and I know they love me extremely, but something threw me off. I’ve realized that they do laugh at everything I say, almost as if “aw, little baby that’s so cute of you” (I’m in my 20s) so I avoid telling them things. I also don’t like how they talk about me behind my back. Like, I can hear you, I’m in the next room. Or talk to my grandmother about me. It’s not negative stuff usually, but just stuff I’ve told them. It really bugs me. Maybe it’s because they should be involving me if they have concerns about me. I’m very closed off when it comes to expressing who I am. When I’m around them, I’m blank. I also have never been in a relationship and I attribute the bulk of that to a fear that I will be made fun of and talked about. I fear intimacy as well for a fear of them finding out. Which idk shouldn’t matter anymore? I believe moving out will be the best thing for me."
AskReddit,fegmq39,t3_ep1654,1579097425.0,Idk man. I’m sitting here crying because I feel so ugly. Maybe for someone other than my mom to call me attractive and genuinely mean it. It’s so fucking stupid but that’s where I’m at right now.
