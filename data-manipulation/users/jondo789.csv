For the last few years, Iran has heavily infiltrated Iraq, both through militant proxies and clandestine backing of pro-Iranian puppets within the Iraqi government (most notably, the PM, Adil Abdul-Mahdi). There have been widespread anti-government protests in Iraq in which hundreds have been killed, and as a result, said pro-Iran PM Mahdi has promised to resign his post. In other words, this PM is far from popular, and by no means representative of the sentiments of the Iraqi people. Not to mention, he is backed by Iran.

Let's face it, anyone with a high school diploma can get into some sort of 4 year college (ahem, ASU...). If American society were able to embrace a system akin the German one - in which a certain percentage of top performing students go to college at an extremely low cost, and the rest get practical training and experience in vocational fields - many of the problems American university grads face, like high unemployment rates and enormous student debt, would be largely mitigated.
