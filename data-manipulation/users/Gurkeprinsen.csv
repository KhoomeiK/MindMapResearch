AskReddit,fft0u9u,t3_euv96i,1580201051.0,"My earliest memory of my ADHD in action: I remember being so obsessed with my surroundings whenever I walked to school(about 7 years old). Every morning I would spend time studying every shiny rock or interesting object found on the way to school, study every building and window I came across- touch the surfaces to feel the textures. So many interesting things going on all at once. I really had no concept of time back then. A walk that would take a normal 7 year old about 15 minutes - I spent about 90(+/-) minutes on. And I never understood why I was always late and got yelled at by my teacher. It never felt that long at all. I also often forgot about time during recess. Often a teacher would stay outside a little longer to make sure I got to class."

ADHD,ffmdu9c,t3_eu45yu,1580053124.0,"Well, we are different and that is a fact. The problem with ADHD is that we appear as normal people while we aren't and that might explain why people treat us as if we were neurotypical. The best way we can combat this is to try and educate them about adhd and hope that they will understand the condition enough to be able to respect our differences. I believe that people rarely does it on purpose- it is just that they don't understand it enough to take it seriously, or that they simply sometimes forget about it..

ICanDrawThat,fenbwo8,t3_ep3cwm,1579281382.0,"Hi. If anyone is interested: I have a **firbolg druid** **female** named **Floria**.

**Request:**

**New Outfit/clothing design/redesign.**

\---

The thing is that I really am terrible at designing outfits, so I only made her a very basic outfit.

Here are some drawings I made of her (also she has a pet cockroach) :

[Her current ref image](https://i.imgur.com/dsFROPl.jpg)

[My first doodle of her](https://i.imgur.com/KkCdC8M.jpg)

[Another doodle of her as a child](https://i.imgur.com/flrDsh6.jpg)

So I was hoping someone out there would like to design her a better outfit? I did think about giving her a fur cape or something but I felt it didn't fit her current outfit.

**She is proficient in light armor. She has leather armor and common clothes in her inventory.**

**Her personality**: She is chaotic good. She sees the beauty in everything and is generally a happy character. She likes putting flowers in her hair, and she is a feminine character. She has a very child-like personality, and is very curious about stuff. She does not mind getting her hands dirty^((like handling slimy, smelly or soily stuff or playing with bugs)). She always give others the benefit of the doubt, and she loves animals. But also she will not hesitate to kill. And she does become scary when she is angry.

**Additional info:** She is a young adult who grew up in the forest, and is used to survive on her own. She knows how to hunt, and she knows how to use the surrounding area around her. She only spent her life with one other individua, so she is not used to be around people. She also has a quartestaff she frequently uses. I am also thinking of something like a summer-ish color palette would fit her. ^(Also her pet roach lives in her hair.)

\-----

Additional info about the request itself:

I am open to anything, really, as long as it isn't lewd or stray too far away from her personality. I don't expect any very detailed stuff. Just a sketch would make me happy. I just really need help with her outfit. Please note that I am basically looking for suggestions and ideas to her new outfit, just so that you are aware that I might change some of it in my later drawings (I will ask you before doing any changes, to make sure you are cool with it). And feel free to use her old reference image as a base if you need do in this request. I am only interested in the clothing part. And I will, ofcourse, give you credit where it's due."
