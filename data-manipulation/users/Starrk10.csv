politics,ffdtwgi,t1_ffdo908,1579828818.0,I never understand why people say things like this. As if Fox is somehow exonerated just because CNN and MSNBC are also completely biased.

There are hordes of misinformed people that will dismiss you as a sexist Bernie bro if you have a problem with her paid Wall Street speeches or point out any problems you have with her record. They’re convinced that she lost because of spiteful Bernie supporters, and not because she wasn’t energetic in any meaningful way."

politics,fewuyvo,t1_fevvwkv,1579419895.0,"A lot of Biden’s base doesn’t care either, or else we’d see a lot more shunning of this type of rhetoric instead of pushing for “voting blue no matter who” whenever anyone calls out major red flags. 

Why not focus more on weeding out the bad candidates so we don’t wind up having to choose someone like him just because we’ve collectively decided to overlook this type of behavior for so long?"

I get tired way before he does when we go on hikes, but if I try to get him to play in the obstacle course in our nearby dog park, there’s a noticeable mental exhaustion after a while.

My parents take him out every evening around the block and my older sister takes him when she walks her dog. I’m just talking about how I’ve personally benefited mentally and physically from taking him out myself since he’s always happy to go for a walk."
getdisciplined,fc55ak5,t3_eg8yba,1577443905.0,"My dog always barks in the morning. I used to think it was his way of asking for food and water, but he barked even though his bowls are full. I recently noticed that it’s his way of asking to go on a walk, so I’ve been getting into the habit of walking him way more often, even daily if possible, and I’ve noticed it’s made him way less vocal throughout the day as well. 

I may be depressed and may not always have the energy to get out of bed, but he’s not, and I don’t think it’s fair to him to have him cooped up when I could easily (physically, anyway) make his day by washing my face and getting dressed to walk him around the neighborhood. 

In my head, it comes down to whether I wanna be in bed all day and have him constantly barking or throwing in a bit of effort to get comfortable enough to go out for a bit and fill my boy with joy. I feel guilty for all the time I spent not considering how stressed he must get not being able to take him out as often as he wants, but he doesn’t seem to hold it against me.

The combination of the satisfaction I get from seeing him happy and the bit of exercise for me seems to be improving my mood and energy levels, so it feels like way less of a chore to go outside."
