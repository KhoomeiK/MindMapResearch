tech,ffjws2r,t1_ffjwbmu,1580009087.0,"I probably wouldn’t ever buy that anyway. I’m not sure I can justify that much for a car before I have paid for literally everything I desire (including financing my business ideas) even if I could afford it, which I potentially will be able to. It just depreciates and you eventually have to replace it. As far as the X goes, or any Tesla, I haven’t decided if I am ready to rely on electric. I like driving kind of far sometimes and while there are charging stations I don’t know that I want to have to plan around that, also I would probably have to limit my housing options. I haven’t bought a house yet and have lately been in the habit of moving cities every few years. Electric cars give you less housing freedom and I don’t want to rely on charging a car at the store. Also my current car is a 2013 and works just fine. I don’t really want to buy a new car if I don’t need one.

I have to admit though, over the last year or so I have considered Tesla a lot more than I would have before. Also I was looking at other cars as well such as Volvo. I was mostly making the luxury SUV rounds."
tech,ffjnd7o,t1_ffiubr4,1580002251.0,When I point that out people just downvote and imply i like fossil fuel. This is a huge concern and the ramifications if we get it wrong are really bad. We also have ancient infrastructure and a lot of companies who are not going to foot the bill to fix it.
tech,ffjmrdb,t1_ffji8y1,1580001843.0,"I was specifically looking for nice Tesla competitors for SUVs and looked at a Range Rover and just laughed and closed it.

I have bought several new cars and you know what dealership I have never been to? A Nissan dealership. I’ve even visited Mitsubishi. New cars should last at least 10 years, and that is even sad in my opinion."

I just don’t recall that being instructed when I was learning to deadlift. Is it because she needs a modification to make the Lyft so she does it sumo style sort of?

It’s really a personal decision though. Would you be happy living there and would it meet your needs to do so.

It can be the most economical decision but if you wouldn’t be happy living there then it would not be a good one."
