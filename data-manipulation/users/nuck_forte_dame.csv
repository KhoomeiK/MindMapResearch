Countries will film this sort of thing and put it up on the news and say ""look our police are the best in the world."" Then go back to being one of the most corrupt police in the world. 
  
This is such a specific situation that there's no use training for it because so many random things have to align.  
  
1. Suspect has to take a hostage and instead of pointing gun at hostage point at the cops. Right there you just use a sniper to shoot them in most western countries. 
  
2. Then they have to have their back to a vehicle of that height.  
  
3. Then they have to not hear men running full sprint behind them. 
  
4. Then the cop has to pull off the vault otherwise if he fails the hostage died. 
  
5. He then has to tackle the suspect which might not happen. The suspect could dodge it or the cop might miss him. In the video he almost went over him entirely. 
  
6. Then if all those things work he's still wresting on the ground with an armed suspect and the hostage is also on the ground near or under them possibly injured and in danger of being shot."

Everyone is irrationally afraid of plane travel even though millions of people traveled by plane today alone and none of them died. Plane travel has the least deaths per unit of travel making it the safest form of travel we have. Car on the other hand kill millions annually but because it's a trickle of deaths no one notices or reports it. Then when 1 plane crashes in a year you get international news coverage. 
  
Same with nuclear. 3 accidents in over 60 years of producing power and less than 1000 total deaths. It's got the least deaths per unit of energy produced than all forms of power production. In fact because nuclear has been producing for so long and so much power it has offset enough fossil fuel emissions to account for saving 1.8 million lives from dying of respiratory illnesses. 
  
Meanwhile like cars fossil fuels and even the green energies like hydro, wind, and solar kill people every day but it's a steady trickle so it's not reported on the news. 
  
For example solar, everyones favorite, is rooftop installed often. Rooftop work is on the top 10 deadliest occupations in the US.  
  
So workers fall and die each day but it doesn't make the news because it's a trickle."

todayilearned,ffgpe2k,t3_etgk8a,1579911693.0,"Hydro electric is also the most deadly and environmentally harmful of the green energies. 
  
Hydro has the most human deaths per unit of energy produced of green energies. This is due to dam breaks killing people. In China alone a dam break in the 1970s killed 230k people.  
  
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banqiao_Dam 
  
They rebuilt the dam. 
  
Now on the other hand nuclear power has the least deaths per unit of energy and is also a green energy.   
  
https://www.statista.com/statistics/494425/death-rate-worldwide-by-energy-source/ 
  
In fact it's estimated that nuclear saves lives through it's long history of offsetting fossil fuels. It's estimated that nuclear has saved 1.8 million people from premature death due to respiratory illness. So nuclear has actually a number far below zero net deaths per unit of energy produced.

I mean wtf. A dam break kills 230k people and you rebuild it but nuclear kills 1 and you shut it down nationwide. 
  
The facts speak for themselves.  
  
If Germany invested the same amount of money they have into wind and solar into nuclear instead they would have completely green energy right now and met their goals.

Fact is that people who claim they want to fight climate change are turning their backs on nuclear, the best and safest tool to fight it.  
  
This is because nuclear power is a victim of the airplane fear perception. This is when something very rarely results in a deadly event but when it does it makes international news and theres lots of deaths.  
  
But like nuclear power airplanes are the safest form of travel. In all of 2017 not a single commercial plane crash occurred. Meanwhile millions of people died in car related events in 2017 and every other year as well. It's basically a trickle versus a very rare surge.

They see this happen to Flint and are like ""Well it's not my problem."" Meanwhile their own pipe infrastructure is on its way there as well and in the future it is them.  
  
To republicans everyone but themselves deserves what happens to them and they don't have to help anyone if they don't want to. 
  
The best example is public transportation. 
  
Many republicans oppose it and say ""Why should my tax dollars go to funding a system I never use. I have a car.""  
  
They can't think 2 steps ahead and realize that the already bad traffic would be even worse without public transport. Parking would be worse too. They aren't paying for someone else's benefit. They are paying to get those people off the road and out of parking lots so they have it easier."

They teach no empathy to their children because the children don't even perceive what they are doing is wrong because their parents never blame them for anything. 
  
For example alot of bullies have parents that when told about their child's behavior immediately blame the school and even the victim saying the victim must have antagonized their kid into beating him up. 
  
Then they go buy the kid ice cream and tell them they are in the right.

 Even without an HOA the town and local ordinances will protect property values.  
  
Basically the HOA is an extra layer of rules that are particular to its area of influence but the HOA rules are typically overkill. The basic rules like not having broken down cars in your front yard, zoned uses, and building ordinances are already there and enforced by the town.  
  
In fact lots of towns even have rules like an HOA would like where and when you can place your trashcan at the curb. 
  
It's just that the town typically doesn't get Nazi about it like an HOA. They will only enforce it if it becomes a problem or gets reported.

I mean lots of women are completely fine with playing that role and are not being forced into it.  
  
At some point the blame has to go onto the wife as well. If she marries an ambitious guy who talks about how one day he wants to be a CEO then she doesn't have the right to complain in 20 years when he does it and needs her to pick up slack at home. Unless he told her she wouldn't have to do that then he's a liar.
  
I say this as a guy who even before marriage has been delegated as the stay at home parent because my work is relatively flexible while my girlfriends isn't. Also she makes more. 
  
When she's CEO I won't complain because I can see it coming and so I have chosen to stay and deal with it.

The issue with college is there is limited space. So you can't include everyone across all races. But when you open a spot for black students with affirmative action you close a spot for a non black student who had better attributes.  
  
Basically a person who wasn't black and was more qualified was passed over for someone who was black and isn't as qualified.   
  
Now if you go back 100 years the situation was reversed and it was deemed wrong/racist. So how can you reverse it today and say it's right?  That's why people call it reverse racism or just plain racism. It's the same practices that used to be used to keep black people out being used now to prefer them."

Personally I enjoy all his stuff too. It's just light hearted comedy and the stories I find to be relatively original.  
  
I think the originality of the stories he does is often overlooked. 
  
A hockey player that becomes a golf star.  
  
A rich kid that has to repeat school to inherit the fortune. 
  
A do gooder who inherits a bunch of wealth and turns bad and has a redemption.

It's basically projecting. They see themselves as a failure so they crave these moments when someone else is the failure and they must point it out. 
  
Same thing happens at work. You probably have that coworker who constantly points out when you or other make mistakes. Even if it's not a big deal they will bring it up in front of everyone when they could just shoot you a private email or come talk to you.
