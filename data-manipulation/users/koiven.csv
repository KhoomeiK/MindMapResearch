Throughout the conversation and via my research, my access to information has changed. Here's my current stance:  
Current law allows CFO to report to a judge to revoke a license for a variety of reasons that are not wholly defined.  
Proposed law will allow anyone to go report to a judge to revoke a license for a specific set of Red Flag reasons.

Therefore, this is new legislation."
CanadaPolitics,fgkmt6b,t1_fggzgfz,1580869142.0,"So the existing legislation says that the CFO can go to a provincial judge to revoke a license.

The new legislation will allow people who are not CFO to go to a provincial judge. That's the difference.

Currently: concerned citizen reports to CFO who reports to judge.  
New system: concerned citizen reports to judge.

Do you see the difference? Do you see how this would be a new set of laws that allow different people to go directly to a judge?

(Now is a good time to reiterate that I'm not arguing on whether this is a good thing or not. That's not what this is about. I'm arguing that the new legislation is distinct from existing ones)"

CanadaPolitics,fggvqnz,t1_fggmnwa,1580770639.0,"You must be trolling as I've spent many many words providing sources and explaining my reasons. Here's one more go at it.

Ok so, [Firearms Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-11.6/) states thus: 
""A person is not eligible to hold a licence if it is desirable, in the interests of the safety of that or any other person, that the person not possess a firearm"" and that a Chief Firearm Officer can refuse to issue a license if they have ""a history of behaviour that includes violence or threatened or attempted violence on the part of the person against any person."" 
It also says that a CFO ""shall refuse to issue a licence if the applicant is not eligible"" for any ""good and sufficient reason."" 
They CFO can also revoke a license ""for any good and sufficient reason including"" where the holder of the license is ""no longer or never was eligible to hold the licence or authorization"" or ""contravenes any condition attached to the licence or authorization"".

I can't find any other relevant sections of the Firearms Act.

To me, who is neither a lawyer nor a policy-maker, this spells out the conditions under which a CFO can refuse to issue or revoke a license. The Act makes reference to being a threat to self or others, but gives a lot of leeway to the CFO and allows them to cite reasons not specifically detailed in the document.


Now onto the CCC. I found where you cited it; seems like you edited a previous comment. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaPolitics/comments/ey673w/comment/fgfu38x) is the permalink for reference.

Key takeaways here are the phrases ""A peace officer, firearms officer or chief firearms officer"" and ""not desirable in the interests of the safety of the person against whom the order is sought or of any other person that the person against whom the order is sought should possess any such thing"".

So my interpretation of this is that certain law enforcement, government or bureaucratic officials can, on a basis of safety of the self or others, seek out an order preventing someone from posessing a firearm.

Now, the Commissioner's Report, which you quoted in that same comment above, says that CFOs are ""authorized to revoke a firearms licence based on their assessment of the licence holder's risk to public safety"". The table below does break down the exact citations, and there were around 650 for Threat to Self and 680 or Threat to Others (or vice versa. That's not a huge distinction but I am working off of memory and the numbers may be switched.)

So, my conclusions are that the existing legislations specifically allows Law Enforcement and certain Government or Bureaucratic officials to, under certain conditions, either refuse to issue a license, revoke an existing one or apply for a court order preventing someone from posessing a firearm. The exact criteria, as well as who can perform the action, vary. 
The general takeaway is that a very specific subset of people can take action, and the reasons for action are vague and ill-defined.

Now, the G&M article that started all of this is behind a paywall so [this](https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2020/02/03/ottawa-to-adopt-red-flag-laws-to-allow-courts-to-confiscate-guns-away-from-people-who-pose-a-threat/#.Xjho5lOIadM) is the best I got.

In it, Bill Blair says ""we want to empower not just the police, but doctors, victims, communities and families"". It also paraphrases him as saying ""New gun-control legislation will include “red flag” laws to remove guns from people deemed by the courts to be at risk of hurting themselves or someone else"".

So, my takeaway from this is that the new legislation will allow non law enforcement or government officials to report, and will clarify the existing language that is overly broad which means....that this is new legislation not covered by the existing framework. 

That was the entire point of this-whether or not its the same legislation or not. I hope you can now see that it isn't. If you disagree, please show me where i went wrong."
CanadaPolitics,fggm0vs,t1_fggijlf,1580764669.0,"Ok here we go again.

>>Do you know that or have a source on the wording?

>No, do you? you also claimed it solve this issue.

I claimed that, based on what quote i could find from Bill Blair as the original article is behind a paywall, that the new legislation seems to be aimed at clarifying vague language in the existing laws and enabling non governmental, bureaucratic or law enforcement officials to report Red Flags.  
Those are my claims. My sources for the existing legislation are the Firearms Act and the Comissioner Report. My source for the intent of the new proposals is based on this quote from Bill Blair, which unfortunately is all I could find on the matter due to the paywall:  
""“There are dangerous situations where the firearm presence becomes deadly. And so we want to empower not just the police, but doctors, victims, communities and families to be able to take steps to render a dangerous situation safe,”

So again, my conclusion: the existing laws have gaps or vague wording in them regarding who can report and for what reason. The proposed new legislation will patch those holes and clarify the language.

>I've already posted them, your free to disagree with the law, but your wrong.

All you posted is a Commissioner's Report, which notably is not the same thing as law or legislation or the Firearms Act.

Someone else posted the Firearms Act and it says the CFO can revoke a license if they feel it is needed. Again, the language was actually very vague and unclear and it seems like ""if it is needed"" is a very broad category.

Please, show me specifically where I am wrong because clearly just telling me I am isn't getting through to my stupid little brain. Show me the law that I am wrong about, I beg you.

>Admen the current law, hap[pends all the time.

CanadaPolitics,fggfni4,t1_fggezdt,1580760874.0,"Man this entire thing has been about whether the new legislation being introduced is new or covered an existing framework already.

I looked at the Firearms Act, I looked at the Commissioner's Report and I looked at (what i could find of) the original article and Bill Blair's statements.

I came to the conclusion that the new proposals are not previously covered by the existing laws, or are codifying language that was vague and prone to overreach and abuse.

That's all relevant to the discussion at hand.

CanadaPolitics,fgg723h,t1_fgg3bgn,1580755643.0,"Ok so first of all the Globe and Mail article this thread is all about is paywalled and i can't find any other articles specifically about the ""Red Flag"" and confiscation parts, so i have to work off the single paragraph that we can see. 

However, in reading through the Commissioner Report you linked as well as the Firearms Act linked above: here's what I've come to.

The current Firearms Act allows the CFO to refuse to issue a license if the individual has a ""history of behaviour that includes violence or threatened or attempted violence on the part of the person against any person.""  
They may revoke a license for ""any good and sufficient reason including""  if the owner ""contravenes any condition attached to the licence or authorization""

This provides a framework for the CFO and other officials to revoke licenses based on the above reasoning. However, the reasons listed are broad and cover a wide area and amount to giving the CFO a lot of jurisdiction in deciding.

The new legislations seems to do two things: a) clarify and codify the reasons for such revocations as they pertain to public safety, self-harm and domestic violence, and b) provide a framework for non governmental officials and agencies to report the ""Red Flags""

After reviewing the Firearms Act, the Commissioners Report and what i could glean from the news article and Mr. Blair's statements, I've come to the conclusion that the new proposed legislation is, in fact, new legislation and is not previously covered by existing laws."

CanadaPolitics,fgfuwya,t1_fgfu38x,1580748151.0,"Hey so either you didnt read the article or your unclear about what words mean

>Under the Firearms Act, CFOs are authorized to revoke a firearms licence based on their assessment of the licence holder's risk to **public safety**

The key words here are 'Public Safety', as in the society at large. 'Public Safety' would cover things like murder sprees, mass murders or other acts of terrorism.

>New gun-control legislation will include “red flag” laws to remove guns from people deemed by the courts to be at risk of **hurting themselves or someone else**, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair says.

That's from the article. Key words are 'Hurting Themselves or Someone Else'. If they self-harm, commit suicide or engage in domestic violence, that does not constitute a public threat. Public is society, Themselves or Someone Else is an individual. An individual does not count as society.

So, the existing laws cover threats to society but not to individuals. This law covers threats to individuals. A threat to an individual is different from a threat to society, as an individual is different from a society. Therefore, this new law covers something not previously covered by existing laws.

So, now that we've looked at the article and gone over some definitions, we can consider this settled right?"

I will also say that while TFA's reliance on nostalgia is acceptable and maybe even needed, but TROS goes too deep on that.

There are some similarities and echoes (because its like poetry; it rhymes) but it is distinct where it matters.

Lets go down your list. Maul, Dooku and Grievous are visually cool and take part to cool scenes and deliver memorable lines, but there isn't much character to them. In fact, you could merge all three into a single villain and not a whole lot would need to be changed or lost. They're all just generic bad guys. I challenge you to name three unique character traits for each, or to break down what arc they go through. If they don't go through an arc, explain how that serves the character, narrative or themes. You can do that for Kylo Ren. All of that stuff is what makes a good character, not how cool they look or how badass their theme song is.

I disagree about Anakin's journey as well. I don't think it was particularly well executed for two reasons: first we never really get to see Anakin in his prime as a Jedi, and second his actual motivation and how it plays out is kinda shaky. Let me explain: In I, Anakin is a kid. In II, he's a padawan but he spends the entire movie disrespecting his masters, being creepy and committing war crimes. In III, it's more of the same and then suddenly he's killing children. We never see Anakin standing tall in the light really, so it doesn't land as well when he falls to the dark. I think that could have been executed much better in the movies. And his motivation is kinda meh. I get what they were going for, but it could have been shown and expressed much stronger.

I'll give you the Alien Races point. The PT felt like a much bigger universe than the ST does, and I agree that we can hold that against the latter movies.

And the lightsaber fights are very subjective, but Im not a huge huge fan of the big over the top style of the PT. Duel of the Fates I like, but I always thought Yoda or 80 yr old mean flipping around was silly, and the Mustafar battle was too over the top and missed the mark. I think it should have played more to the emotional conflict between the two than towards the spectacle. Generally, I think the PT lightsaber fights sacrifice emotions for spectacle.

DnD,ffs9kgm,t3_euxmgi,1580176468.0,"The story of Goblin War Cry:

Party is fighting some goblins and tracked them to their cave hideout. They dispatch the sentries out front pretty easily and start to make their way in.  
Quick note: the layout of this cave us basically a single corridor with chambers branching off, but the corridor twists and turns into an S shape so there are plenty of blind corners.

Anyway, party breaks open the door and makes their way down the first section and come across the first side door. They crack it open and see a room that serves as the kennels for the goblins' wolf pets. There are some cages with 2 or 3 wolves in each, and a goblin tending to them. One cage is opened and he is feeding the wolves within, his back turned to the door. 

So this is actually a pretty good position for the party. None of the wolves noticed them peeking through the door and the goblin has his back turned. One cage is opened, but not a big deal its just 2 wolves. As long as they take care of the goblin quickly and stop him from opening more cages, this should be a pretty easy encounter.

Here's the conversation that followed:  
Ranger (whose favored enemy is actually goblin and thus speaks their language): i want to kick down the door-

Me, the DM: classic move

Ranger: -and let out a goblin war cry as i do

Me: a goblin war cry?

Ranger: yeah, so they know i mean business

Me: ok, so you're plan is to attack this goblin with a goblin war cry. A war cry in goblin. 

Ranger: that's right

Me: right. A goblin war cry-a call to arms-in the middle of a goblin cave?

Ranger: yes, i see no flaws with this plan

At this point, both of the other players have caught on to what's about to happen. To their credit, they both kept quiet for which i am eternally grateful.

So, ranger kicks down the door and shouts out a goblin war cry that echoed down the hall. They did manage to kill the goblin in the room before he could open more cages, and the wolves also weren't too big of an issue.

What became an issue was, two rounds later, when the rest of the goblins in the cave started to show up, having heard the goblin war cry coming from the entrance. 

To the ranger's credit, he did eventually realize what drew the reinforcements and he did eventually realize what a moron he was.

What ensued was an epic battle against a a dozen goblins that were supposed to be fought in 2s and 3s. It often involved one side or the other feigning retreat only to ready their actions against whoever followed. Goblins being goblins, they are naturally better at that sort of maneuver.

Miraculously, no one actually died in that fight although every character went unconscious at least once, some two or three times and when it ended the four players probably had a dozen HP between them.

All of that story isn't really the stupidest thing though. That was several sessions later, when the Ranger did basically the exact same thing by attacking a cultist who was clearly concentrating very hard on controlling a trapped demon. Once again, I tried to walk him through the chain of thought and once again the rest of the party clearly knew what was about to happen: Ranger attacks the cultist who loses her concentration and the fiend is let loose and goes on a rampage. Once again, no one died but many came close."

You're assuming that the asian guy was not qualified for the role, that he somehow stole the job from a more qualified white person.
