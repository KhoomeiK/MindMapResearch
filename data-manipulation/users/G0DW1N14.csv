ClashOfClans,fecfkmt,t1_feaxdl4,1578972724.0,Yeah it's all majestic/magical themed because the warden is the hero and they have to introduce him by giving him a home and th11 is his home. My personal favourite things about th11 is the artillery. The golden chains are just the best things for decorating the beast. Any other artillery is not that cool. Also this chain decoration theme is on inferno towers too. Wish they had introduced it to others too. It's looks so cool to me. And yes the animation is sick too but the corners are plain to me. You know i have an idea to make everything looks 100 times more better. Someone earlier posted that we should get themed background for the villages like spell valley or pekka's playhouse. It would be sick if every townhall had its signature background. Like after th9 give every th its seperate place in the universe. Like th9 at a graveyard or spooky forest. Th10 in a volcanic soil like the war background. Th11 on a majestic floating island with clouds surrounding it like something from tv shows (idk I don't watch much shows) or themes like from LOL etc. For th12 i have no idea cause I don't like it. Th13 can be in winter evil land like a place filled with storm and snow. Blizzards and avalanche every where. And the villages are the only place of shelter. It would just make the visuals go 10 better for villages. Sometimes it's just weird to see a fully lava pool in normal grass lol.
ClashOfClans,fe9kafx,t1_fe9jmcs,1578938630.0,I know mate. My brother did this with his account. But I've maxed out the th 100% since th7 and idk it's tempting to upgrade cause everything else is upgraded to max except heroes and a couple dark elixr troops. But idk i won't get that satisfaction i get while taking screenshots of my maxed out base. Like my th8 base grind was almost a year in itself and then i upgraded and maxed out all my defences and left the game for 2 years and now I'm back and seeing everything so cheap lol. But still that satisfaction of getting everything with grinding is something to me especially im a hardcore f2p lol. I find my happiness in those screenshots of my bases.
TokyoGhoul,fe9e6up,t3_eo52ta,1578936761.0,"Watch anime then read the manga. This way you'll appreciate the manga even more lol. Atleast that's what i did. I didn't watch re anime cause i was already so ahead in manga that i didn't want to watch the anime for the same things, i just found the osts on internet and heard them while reading the manga for re. For the first series i liked both the shows as the story was really different from the manga, and i liked variety even if it was bad(as many say it), but it has it's own moments. Definitely would say to read the manga (it is a must, you must read it to see the masterpiece created by the author), it's just a masterpiece looking at characters (not to spoil) but there are many things behind the characters faces than you see in the beginning it's just a masterpiece of character design and the best part if manga is not that you live kaneki but you will love every single character in the story, even the villains have their sad parts where you'll feel bad for them and I'm sure you're in for a hell of a ride, but if you don't mind watching something which is very different than the original story and can accept some major changes and like some shitty variety like me then watch the show. I'm already being hated by many for suggesting anime before manga and saying it's not that bad but i guess it's my opinion and since you asked for opinions here's mine."

ClashOfClans,fe8n98r,t1_fe8hlep,1578928207.0,"Imo the defence design are good on th11 but the overall view is kinda lame. It maybe because I took a break from the game when th11 had only 150 or something maxed walls and have never seen th11s in their full prime. But honestly th10s feel so much better, even after they are destroyed they leave a mesh behind showing lava beneath the th. It's not available on any other townhall. And since level 11 walls no walls had a good animation, look at those 11 walls with skulls with lava. Anything close to it is the new ice walls but they missed the special animation for corners like in walls of lvl 9/10/11. I know the th11 theme was a castle kind of look with more gold and white colours on the pallet but to me lava and ice looks more cool signifying more mystical things in the game. Th9 with skulls and graveyard theme, th10 literally built above a lava pool and then we have th12 looking like some electricians workshop who messed everything up. Also the mortar thing you mentioned was a good design but its sad they discontinued it in the same th. I liked it too."

wholesomememes,fe6ks13,t3_enuacc,1578894174.0,I never had a pet myself but all my cousin's had dogs in their house and all and them were a year older than me. I used to fear every single of them while growing up. I turned 14-15 and didn't fear dogs anymore and when i went to their house after a long time i asked them where were their dog? They said they passed away. That moment i felt so sad. It hit me that i used to fear from them and now they are gone and no one's gonna come running to gate to sniff me and run crazy with happiness and getting me to pet them and i would try to be stiff as a pole. I miss the dogs even after 3 years of all this. All the dogs loved me since i was the youngest kid in the family and it hit me that they loved me as their younger sibling and all of them would always come and lick me and i could never appreciate them. I miss those wonderful dogs.

Why are they spending huge sums of money for this and yet no YouTube or streaming to get fame. What's the motive? One stupid thing that comes to my mind is that this can be someone trying to get the black money into white, idk how and sounds kinda stupid but i just don't get the point of it. Like i see youtubers spending thousands but they get it back from views and the fame. But this guy is just openly trying to tell the world he loves Stephanie and he wants to Netflix and chill with her. Imagine if someone investigates and something creepy comes out like this person can be millionaire or a drug overlord or something and making the money white and there exists no Stephanie and it's just his imagination or crush or something who thinks this guy's a weirdo and he's try'na prove to her lol."
ClashOfClans,fe3w41d,t1_fe3tz86,1578853413.0,"I think as higher up you go you see bases at level with you, idk much about legend league and the new system and am basing my theory of what i understand from previous system and other games with global leaderboards, these accounts go so high up that the eight attacks they see are mostly their alt accounts. And there's not 4-5 accounts but 4-5 clans full of these accounts all on higher trophies making it harder to match anyone else.i feel this is highly coordinated and how they do. I saw some videos which analysed yhese accounts actions and they all tend to attack very early in day, maybe because their are in asia and they can attack earlier than people in europe or NA, but these things are seriously well coordinated. Idk maybe the new system can match 6k player to 8k, but this surely is well coordinated and give them that."
ClashOfClans,fe32jiu,t1_fe2usmb,1578845275.0,What i feel is happening is that both the things you mentioned are happening at the same time. Two months earlier every account named was dr mujtaba and that's it and a seperate account was named Stephanie heart Dr.M. As some others have said it too that this guy paid everyone to change names and they all boosted the Stephanie account. And since many accounts have same name no one will ever suspect that it's only one guy getting boosted but many noticed it. That's why now there are three Stephanie accounts on leaderboard right now. I feel naming the accounts is just to avoid suspicion from supercell but there surely is win trading going on (if not then i apologise for calling out) and SC needs to investigate for this. And i really feel that pushing to 8k isn't that simple and dr.m has been pulling it for past few months.

I have few friends and they didn't play at that time and used to say so. Just takes of tension of my mind of being on a team like where to drop, loot goblins and kill stealers etc cause there are always people who never wanna work with team and when they die they keep shouting like crazy like help me i dies cause of you all or some other shit. Also i never like the game that much cause of the way Tencent started taking it by just copying Fortnite with their royale pass and everything. Also i always faced people saying eww you play mobile games you noob or something, and look who's Playing these games with a emulator on pc and on their 50k phones those same guys cause they don't have money to afford ""real games"", without this game i have more time to do what i want and i am away from such toxic people and players who play unfairly and spending my time happily. Even if i wanted to play on vacation i would never cause I haven't played any fps for a year and i will suck and if i ask my friends to play they will just mock me rather than having fun with me.

Don't want to have problems with anyone cause of a game.

Edit: also I'm a really agressive player on fps, not suitable for these types of game. I feel like doing something everytime so that i can finish faster. This game is just not my play-style.

I know i should shoot bushes but sometimes you forget. As i remember my very last match was on vikendi. The dude was hidden for 3 last circles, i was at 16 kills (my personal best) and was continuously searching for him but this dude wasn't in a bush just prone between two rocks in the snow with a tree up front.

I don't have time to play whole half hour match get to top 2 and get railed by a snake. Doesn't matter almost every map has terrain features that can allow people to hide irrespective of their outfit. Also if Tencent really cared about it's player base it would've never introduced them at first place. Look at epic they introduced some skins that blended too well in tress and bushes, players complained everywhere and what happened epic changed the skins, also allowed refunds for those who wanted refunds. Giants like Tencent never care especially Chinese giants, they are here just for quick bucks and sometimes your data too (i can't confirm this but you never know cause it's China), that's why so much chest systems even though the world hates it and what caused giants like EA's sales fall because of these chest systems.
