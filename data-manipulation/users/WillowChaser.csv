I know he'll be happy to have me around and feed him and clean his cage and let him play around. It's not much, but it's a reason for me to get up in the morning."

brussels,fdmpii5,t3_em2rxs,1578559427.0,"There are no seat assignments for national trains, and there's no limit to the amount of people that can book a train ticket, so don't worry about your trains selling out. 

You just book a ticket from start place - destination (or a return ticket) for specific dates, and you can take the train on any time for your chosen day.

You can book your tickets in advance if you don't want to go through the hassle of buying a ticket in the moment, just make sure to have your tickets on hand! In all stations there should be ticket machines and/or ticket booths where you can get what you need. You'll get the option between second class (cheaper) and first class (more empty seats) tickets, and one way or return tickets.

If you're under 26, you can get a go-pass which is cheaper than a regular ticket, and sometimes there's cheaper weekend tickets too.

There's 3 main train stations in Brussels: Brussels North, Brussels Central and Brussels South. You'll likely be arriving in Brussels South from London. The names for the stations are slightly different in Dutch and French, which can be confusing, so make sure you're in the station you need!

North = Brussel-Noord / Bruxelles-Nord

Central = Brussel Centraal / Bruxelles Central

South = Brussel-Zuid / Bruxelles Midi

There's also an app for our national railway if you want it: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.sncbnmbs&hl=en)

Within Brussels itself there's easy public transport through tram, metro or bus which you can get separate tickets for:  [https://www.stib-mivb.be/abon\_tickets.html?l=en](https://www.stib-mivb.be/abon_tickets.html?l=en)  this is a separate company from the railway. 

Have fun on your trip!"

belgium,fdac1uq,t1_fd9up7s,1578244382.0,"I agree with u/Proto_bear, not once was I informed in advance of any big test we were going to do. Suddenly it was just 'we're doing the beep test/coopertest today' and I'd never ran 5k in my life, but was suddenly being graded on it. Or we were told 'today we're doing somersaults' and never properly explained how to do it. So I failed a bunch of these tests. 

As for staying after hours, either i'd have a class after LO, so no time to stay to practice, or the day was over and the teachers had gone home, so no option here either. LO felt very much like our teacher just telling us ""do xyz"", letting us struggle on our own, and very rarely offering extra help. Like, climbing ropes was often part of some exercises we did, but I was expected to know how to do it and never explained.

Sure, there were some parts I enjoyed more, not all of it was useless, but it definitely wasn't handled well."

I've had an EKG and an echo done several years ago, blood pressure and everything checked by doctors and cardiologists, and everything is completely healthy and fine.

I've been trying to get into work a little earlier to get in some work when it's quiet, but my boss seems to have been getting into the same habit, so that's not really working out. Maybe I'll try working later as well.
