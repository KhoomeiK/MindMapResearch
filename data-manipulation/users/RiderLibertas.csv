bi·ome - noun: biome; plural noun: biomes
a large naturally occurring community of flora and fauna occupying a major habitat

Again, no way Nova Scotia and Florida are the same biome.  Not the same flora or fauna, not even close."

halifax,ff428ha,t1_ff3vh5z,1579553952.0,All animals need from us is for us to leave them alone and stop taking their habitats.  This is unused land right now.  Once it's a wilderness park for people it's no longer habitats for animals.  5% doesn't seem like much but a here and a bit there there - it adds up and that is exactly we got to where we are now.

They told me I was adopted with a special storybook when I was very young.  So young that I don't even remember them telling me, I just remember them reading this beautiful story about how they got me.  I never had to have the big surprise - you're adopted trauma.  I never once felt the need to find any ""real"" parents.  I never thought of them as anything but my parents."

PlanetZoo,fdxvi7m,t3_enarn4,1578773362.0,I can confirm that it is not possible.  I only play in Sandbox and found this out recently when a 100% size polar bear I nabbed while building my African zoo wasn't available in my new Arctic zoo.  I understand this does work in Franchise mode but definitely not in Sandbox.

PlanetZoo,fd3vghk,t1_fd25xyz,1578161987.0,Just go crazy with trees everywhere you can.  I haven't found any performance hit from doing that.  It really helps make a zoo look great and you won't get the complaints from the guests.  I've still got a lot of work to do on my zoo but last night I jacked up the ride price to $20 and got no complaints.  All 7 stations too :)
TrueReddit,fcyuz5u,t3_ej4qov,1578087652.0,"Actually it shows that everything is working according to plan.  What you have to realize is the name of the game is capitalism and money is the only thing that matters.  Given that why blame the winners for being better at the game?  The problem is the game itself.  Unfettered capitalism seems good for a while, but just like the game of monopoly, eventually, all the money goes to the winner and it's no fun for anyone else.  It undermines democracy because your government can't help you anymore - they sold you out long ago.  The corporations are calling the shots now so buckle up buttercup, it's going to get a lot worse than this!  They are surely amused to see you all dividing yourselves left and right as if that had any impact on them.  What a joke!"

PlanetZoo,fckrdnz,t3_ehpsa8,1577731544.0,"I played with this a bit.  I think the letters are all the same size but they are using a bunch of them to make that ""highlight"".  Put down one letter and leave it white.  Then copy it 4 times, make the copies all the same contrast color, then move each copy a tiny bit - up, down, left, right.  Make the original white one stick out just a bit more than the rest.  It worked for me."

PlanetZoo,fcex2gk,t3_egwbah,1577624542.0,I wonder if it actually affects them just being there or if it would be more of an issue in a walk-in habitat?
PlanetZoo,fcewsou,t3_eh034t,1577624466.0,I did the first 3 scenarios in beta and absolutely hated it.  I just didn't like fixing broken zoos I didn't make.  It was annoying.  I haven't left sandbox mode since release and doubt I ever will.
PlanetZoo,fcew7p7,t3_eh4u0p,1577624280.0,Beautiful and natural.  Great pics too!
PlanetZoo,fc9soi6,t3_egtjix,1577557631.0,"I think this happens when an animal gets ""stuck"".  I've seen it before.  It's a bug.  If you have unlimited water and you get a message that an animal is dehydrated you can pick him up and move him to get him unstuck.  Sometimes.  Other times it won't work.  It's a very annoying bug that has been around since beta but it doesn't happen as often now."
PlanetZoo,fc98zpj,t3_egcyni,1577548954.0,I don't find it slow but I really wish the brush size could be made much bigger for doing larger areas.

PlanetZoo,fc34qth,t3_efstcg,1577381392.0,"Career Mode - part tutorial, part fix broken zoos you didn't build.  It's good to do the first 3 at least as you will learn a lot about how the game mechanics work.

Franchise Mode - micromanagement with a steep learning curve.  Some love it, I hate it :)  This game still has some bugs that are going to be more obvious in this mode.

Sandbox - full creativity.  This is my mode.  It's a great sandbox because there are so many features you can turn off and on so you can still challenge yourself but you can cut out the parts you don't like.  So you can have full-on creativity only or management-light.  Less bugs in this mode than the others."
PlanetZoo,fc343fg,t3_efoe2x,1577380963.0,"Be aware there are still quite a few bugs in the game that affect different people differently.  For some they can be game breaking - as in losing a zoo game breaking.  For others it's just little annoyances.  What bugs you get seems to be completely random - those with powerful computers are hit as well.  Also, you might not have any bugs now but after the next patch you might.

Overall, I think it's an amazing game, but it was definitely released too early and they are scrambling to get it finished.  That said, Frontier is good at listening to their players and does release regular patches.  Sometimes that's a good thing :)  

The learning curve is pretty steep but there are tons of YouTubers with tutorials for everything so if you like that kind of learning it's not a problem.  The potential of this game is through the roof and there are many different ways to play.  I'd recommend watching some YouTube videos before you decide but keep in mind the YouTubers aren't going to talk much about the bugs, some do but it's rare."
