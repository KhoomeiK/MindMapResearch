ToolBand,fexdksg,t3_eqt23d,1579429216.0,"Late '90s, TOOL in OKC with the Melvins opening. 

My buddy and I show up early to catch Buzzo and the boys. Obviously, they were amazing, but the Okie audience was full of meatheads who didn't agree. Que whistles, boos, ""Put TOOL on"", and eventually shoes being thrown (which I have never understood). Eventually,  Buzz gives up and walks off-stage in disgust. 

Between sets MJK walks on stage while the setting is being changed, wearing a bath robe, and says something along the lines of ""I feel bad for all you assholes who just booed that wonderful band, you are probably pretty closed minded and have really shitty lives.""

Few minutes later, TOOL comes on, MJK is still wearing the bathrobe, but now he has a wig on. After a couple of songs, he takes the robe off and is wearing a dress with some HUGE fake tits under it. For the next several songs Maynard proceeds to do a slow strip tease until he is wearing nothing but a jockstrap and the bustier. 

Halfway into the show he leans into the mic, stares at the mosh pit,  and says ""Some of you might be wondering why I chose do dress this way tonight. Well, I figure there are a lot of redneck homophobes in the audience right now. I hope this makes you feel really uncomfortable while you rub your sweaty bodies against each other. Oh yeah, this next song is about anal sex. Enjoy.""
