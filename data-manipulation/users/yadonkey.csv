 The problem is that politicians arent held accountable when they vote against public opinion.

Alternately they stand to loose a lot of money (or have a lot of money spent against them) if they vote against the special interest groups.... consequently Sanders could spend every waking hour gathering 100% public support for M4A and it still wouldn't make any difference when it comes time to vote for the bill."

.... so being able to pick your insurance  from a pool of private companies isnt open market?? You think its bureaucrats that are ruining the healthcare? Seriously?? 

 Thanks to ""free markets"" hospitals are made to be for profit. So [hospitals consolidate](https://www.ncci.com/Articles/Pages/II_Insights_QEB_Impact-of-Hospital-Consolidation-on-Medical-Costs.aspx), and this is great because it lowers operating cost by 15%-30% ... but do you think that translates to cheaper prices?? Nope instead the average price for service goes up 6%-18%... and they buy up the private practices which then gives them the monopoly in the area.

>The fact is that tax payers shouldn't pick up the burden of people who want to go to college.

Why not? We pick up the burden when people dont make enough to live on. We pick up the burden when people cant get a job or ever get ahead so they turn to crime... and all of that is a hell of a lot cheaper than the burden we get to pick up everytime somebody wants to go to war.

>There are different choices they can make, it isnt fair.

Being ""fair"" isnt the best metric for success. It isnt fair to give inmates job skills they can use when they get out, but it greatly benefits us all when they instead of coming back to jail get out and get a job and start contributing to the system.

Conservatives tend to want to go after the symptoms of a problem. They see a high crime area as a moral failing by the people there. So comservatives want to fix the problem by causing the people to feel like crime isnt worth it because of the punishments doled out for committing them.

 As a liberal, my biggest issue with the conservative view to problems is that it rarely ever coincides with what we know about human behavior and what study after study has shown us.

>1. Non-Muslims make up the majority of terrorists in the United States: According to the FBI, 94% of terrorist attacks carried out in the United States from 1980 to 2005 have been by non-Muslims. This means that an American terrorist suspect is over nine times more likely to be a non-Muslim than a Muslim. According to this same report, there were more Jewish acts of terrorism in the United States than Islamic, yet when was the last time we heard about the threat of Jewish terrorism in the media? For the same exact reasons that we cannot blame the entire religion of Judaism or Christianity for the violent actions of those carrying out crimes under the names of these religions, we have absolutely no justifiable grounds to blame Muslims for terrorism. 

>2. Non-Muslims make up the majority of terrorists in Europe: There have been over one thousand terrorist attacks in Europe in the past five years. Take a guess at what percent of those terrorists were Muslim. Wrong, now guess again. Its less than 2%. 

>3. Even if all terrorist attacks were carried out by Muslims, you still could not associate terrorism with Islam: There have been 140,000 terror attacks committed worldwide since 1970. Even if Muslims carried out all of these attacks (which is an absurd assumption given the fact mentioned in my first point), those terrorists would represent less than 0.00009 percent of all Muslims. To put things into perspective, this means that you are more likely to be struck by lightening in your lifetime than a Muslim is likely to commit a terrorist attack during that same timespan.

>4. If all Muslims are terrorists, then all Muslims are peacemakers: The same statistical assumptions being used to falsely portray Muslims as violent people can be used more accurately to portray Muslims as peaceful people. If all Muslims are terrorists because a single digit percentage of terrorists happen to be Muslim, then all Muslims are peacemakers because 5 out of the past 12 Nobel Peace Prize winners (42 percent) have been Muslims. 

>5. If you are scared of Muslims then you should also be scared of household furniture and toddlers: A study carried out by the University of North Carolina showed that less than 0.0002% of Americans killed since 9/11 were killed by Muslims. (Ironically, this study was done in Chapel Hill: the same place where a Caucasian non-Muslim killed three innocent Muslims as the mainstream media brushed this terrorist attack off as a parking dispute). Based on these numbers, and those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the average American is more likely to be crushed to death by their couch or television than they are to be killed by a Muslim. As a matter of fact, Americans were more likely to be killed by a toddler in 2013 than they were by a so-called Muslim terrorist."
sociology,fgbslw4,t1_fg8dy67,1580665710.0,">We often see hosts that sit up front and field seating positions at the tables.

Yeah but they arent hiring those host just to have them as a standby incase somebody doesnt show up. Like you said ""it's more efficient"". Sure a waitress could take that over which would have the effect of:

* Downgrading a establishment thats selling itself as classier than a cafe in the eyes of the patrons.

* Pulling waitresses away from waiting tables which would effect customer satisfaction. 

>We also see bus people that clean up the tables after a customer is done. They are minimum wage folks in many cases. The server could do that themselves, but its less efficient.

That's just not realistic. The people cleaning tables are also the ones doing the dishes which theres a constant stream of. There's no way a waitress could do both unless if the restaurant is even remotely successful.

>Efficiency is what allows a surplus to the restaurant owner.

Which speaks directly to my point, nobody hires more people than they need. Restaurants have the exact number of people they need to be able to efficiently make the restaurant money. If they hired less they'd lose more money than they would from a raised minimum wage. If the wages go up the restaurant always has the option to slightly raise prices to cover the added cost. If the restaurant doesnt have enough workers it'll cause them to have fewer customers and less tips which just snowballs until they go out of business.

>Paying a kid, to bus tables, $15/hr isnt efficient

If you're comparing it to paying $7 an hr, sure it's way worse for the restaurant. If you're comparing it to paying them $20 an hr it's way better for them...... and in this case you'd be comparing paying somebody $15 an hr vs losing a lot of business because customers aren't being adequately served."
