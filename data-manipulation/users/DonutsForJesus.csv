assholedesign,fghnozi,t3_eyddj1,1580789050.0,"It wasnt boots for me, but I saw an ad on Facebook about a lightsaber, that was supposed to be made out of metal and ""durable and perfect for lightsaber battles"". The hilt looked great. It had a purple LED option too. I waited 2 months for it to show up only for it to be a plastic hilt, with a 'maybe' 12"" phony blade, that was in a plastic bag labeled 'TOYS' on the little cardboard piece at the top. It wasn't even a purple LED either. Just a cruddy RGB light. I tried to find the website, and they took it down soooo yeah. I should've know better. Now I shop Ultrasabers for my nerdy, Star Wars geek self."

BlackPeopleTwitter,ffnkicj,t1_ffnk3ix,1580067198.0,My point is both should be accountable. No President needs to be playing golf when there are more important things that need to be done or dealt with.

I understand that there are people who date rocks, but it just seems inaccurate and contains a bunch of guess work. I read a article about a geologist who tested recent, 50 year old lava composites, and they had so much Argon-40 that they read the composites to be 350,000 years old. I don't know, but I personally don't trust it. I'm also not saying that earth is only 2020 years old lol. But I don't believe it is 4+ billion years old."
