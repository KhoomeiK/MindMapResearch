Amd,ffqnr0i,t1_ffq7gfa,1580139410.0,So - you wrote a lot of nothing trying to... argue?  Can you share what you would do as AMD so that I understand what you are saying.

conspiracy,ffpt14z,t1_ffpnb5e,1580104631.0,Yup. Gotta use the bots to drive down the stock market and then pump it back up. If you use leverage you can win 3x on the way down and 3x on the way up.
Amd,ffpl5io,t1_ffpjnym,1580097737.0,I do believe I referenced that above. No card from different vendors is ever the same spec. In this case some did better than others. Just like the aib 5700xt launch. Some super suck. Some are great.
Amd,ffpi0gs,t3_eugkkt,1580095527.0,"I mean, I get it, but I also don't understand the freak out (fully). 

Here were the options AMD had:

* Do nothing.
   * Reviews will show it doing well vs the 2060 when overclocked (this was in the notes prior to launch, AMD knew they left headroom).
   * Newbs will buy it or not, either way they won't overclock.
* Lower the cost.
   * AMD loses $, people still buy Nvidia.
* Release a pre-overclocked bios to rule out the potential overclock issues in 'do nothing' stage.
   * Newbs get a boost if they buy later in the cycle, pros can buy early in the cycle and flash their own, Newbs who don't know any better get the exact same card as above (do nothing).
   * This does expose variability in the cards a bit more, but brings up the overall performance per $ across the entire line of 5600xts.

So the end result for newbs (which everyone seems to be worried about) is that boosting the clocks with the bios will likely help them the most.  Yeah, a few early buyers might be confused if they watch some of these tech videos, but damn, they can just overclock it then to get better performance (yeah, some cards are better, some are worse, but holy shit this is a constant no matter the cards and releases)."
AMD_Stock,ffpgxm8,t1_ffpacwt,1580094775.0,Well - the \~4 days after ER were brutal.  And then smart money started reviewing the books and realized the potential.  And the jump to $50 came in the weeks following.
Economics,ffpgqx8,t1_ffpa8fy,1580094646.0,"Well, true capitalism isn't what most people think.  Most people think of 'consumerism' or 'out of control corporations.'   Capitalism is more akin to lending.  Why work when you can lend your money, make money on your money, so you don't have to work for money!

Basically - USA is not capitalism.  It is of course, a confusing strange blend of many things and capitalism is somehow the definition.  And yes, it involves rabid hippos that have pretty weak chains on them."

RealEstate,ffnpmgo,t3_eub2th,1580069027.0,"Ok. So real answer (my opinion) is that if you can get 1800 I think it’s worth it to keep.  Rentals are not just about profit, they are also for tax benefits. You will be able to write off a ton of the expenses and reduce your taxable liability. Also the income will allow you to get additional loans and purchase more properties.  They are also a good hedge against inflation.

So yeah - long term play. Which most people shy away from, but please not that most people blow their money and live paycheck to paycheck rather than thinking for the future."
