honesttransgender,ffqbsx3,t1_ffp7g4j,1580129604.0,"except that there kinda is, and I do agree with you in many of your other thoughts. There are gnc cis people, NB people both trans and not, questioning people, and probably a few trans women although as previously mentioned a femboy space wouldn’t really be for them. 

some of the people in that space are trans, some are questioning, and some are not. just because they’re all in the same space and may on the surface look similar doesn’t mean that they are the same or should be treated as such. They aren’t really our concern until they take up “trans” as a description for themselves. 

trans communities as they are don’t cater to questioning people (which is fine) but then a lot of trans meds take issue with the subs that are specifically for trans questioning people that spread misinformation about what “trans” is and tell people if they are or not (and no one should do that to anyone, ever, either to confirm or deny). 

And on that point I don’t really agree with you either. While sometimes yes people aren’t aware of or acknowledging what gender dysphoria is or how it looks in their lives, some people straight up don’t have that “strong desire” in the DSM that is the basis for the entire requirement. 

We should have a collection of dysphoric experiences that questioning people can read and see examples of, since it can be hard to apply dry bullet points to your own life experiences. It seems sometimes that every other post on r/asktransgender and ftm/mtf spaces are “am I trans?”. there’s clearly a need for the trans community to put out something that can guide questioning people or even help cis people understand our experiences more."
