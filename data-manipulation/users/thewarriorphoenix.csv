PlanetFitnessMembers,ffk2aab,t3_etrp1f,1580013604.0,Basically a duplicate class was added. A PF employee accidentally clicked on the schedule and added a weekend class. With the software that they use it’s not surprising.  The trainer didn’t catch it in enough time to delete it. I’m sorry this happened to you. Depending on the trainer don’t give up just yet on classes. PF TRAINER here

PlanetFitnessMembers,fehttp7,t3_ep5gb7,1579123738.0,"Depending on the location and franchise PF tends to milk and drain their trainers and even then they want more from them. These trainers are the lowest paid in the industry BUT if you’re the full time trainer you get benefits, don’t have to work weekends and the work hours/schedule is sometimes really nice late mornings and/or early afternoons. It’s a great place to start out as a trainer but not a place to stay. I’ve been a trainer at 2 locations. My first location paid me 14 an hour and I had to teach 11 classes on top of designing workouts for multiple people.
My second location only 12 an hour and teaching 8 classes. Let me know if you have any questions. Happy to answer and good luck with everything!"
