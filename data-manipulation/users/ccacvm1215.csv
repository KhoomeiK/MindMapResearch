interesting,ffbe8sw,t3_esownk,1579761555.0,This makes me uneasy
Paranormal,ff56d6x,t3_erl4p9,1579581508.0,Woah. Just woah. Never thought garden gnomes could be real. I'm a little freaked out right now
CodingandBilling,ff2p45w,t3_eqlf8j,1579517361.0,Following! I looked into this as well but I've heard nothing but horrible things about Penn Foster.
Parenting,ff2o9b2,t3_er8jvl,1579516040.0,That's just crazy. I would feel horrible as a parent if my kids were so busy they didnt have time to just relax at home. 10:30pm is way too late to be going to bed. They probably feel so overwhelmed. I hope you can sort things out with your wife. Extra curricular activities are always great but this is a little extreme.
Anxiety,fem0zyo,t3_epnec0,1579236266.0,"Dont worry, you're not alone! I'm gonna be 27 this year and have been driving for about 2 years now. But still, I feel so late because a lot of my friends have been driving for years already..But it gives me such bad anxiety that I literally only drive for maybe 5-10 mintues a day. Thank goodness I live close to everything. I also am too terrified to take my test. I know its dumb to drive without a license but I am terrified and just thinking about it makes my heart race. My state ID expired a while back and I know I have to go take this dang test and just get it over with but ANXIETY"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fe6jvqk,t3_enpqte,1578893284.0,"It might just be me, but I find this wedding picture so awkward. Cate looks sorta cute but this pic isnt their best."
mentalillness,fe6jpte,t3_entsq0,1578893125.0,"I understand. I NEED to get a job. It would be better for my family if I got a job but the thought of it scares me and I dont know why. I would like to work, but the thought of it is overwhelming"
Parenting,fe6jmvt,t3_enwdpg,1578893047.0,So sweet. Congrats!!! Enjoy those babies. They will be your strength during this hard time you are facing.
driving,fdr7i82,t3_emsdph,1578680607.0,"People are super impatient these days. I still remember when I was learning to drive the light turned green and I didnt go right away and this guy started honking at me all crazy. I was really upset cuz it had just turned green like 3 seconds before.  Some people are just horrible impatient, aggressive drivers! Dont let it get to you."
SuicideWatch,fdd28sa,t3_ekhjqm,1578291875.0,You can message me! The world is a fucked up place but it also has a lot of nice things about it too. Look how many of us strangers care about you. If you are still there I hope you see all these comments and I hope you at least message some of us. I'm willing to listen if you want to talk.
Anxiety,fd12b9n,t3_ejqtj4,1578126807.0,"Same here. Anxiety is terrible and I am really getting fucking tired of it!!! 26 years old and I havent done shit with my life except drop out of college and have two kids. I get you. We can do it, even if it the hardest thing we have to do in our lives"
driving,fcww80n,t3_ej7wv3,1578040227.0,Do you live in a big city? If you do maybe try going to a DMV located in a smaller nearby town. They might not be as busy and maybe the driving instructors wont be so hard on you.
Anxiety,fcvq9pz,t3_eit1wh,1578007667.0,Yes. Unfortunately anxiety has ruined my marriage.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fcvq77o,t3_eiyl02,1578007622.0,Unpopular opinion but I dont think shes pretty. Certainly not ugly but not that pretty either. She needs to tone down the dark eyeshadow. Also why is her hair always in her face like that. I would love to see her do a cute bun or something. It would be refreshing to see. Her hair always looks like a tangled greasy mess.
SuicideWatch,fcvppbv,t3_ej5q0o,1578007302.0,"I've been feeling like this too lately! As sad as it sounds I am so tired of life. Nothing in my life has ever gone right. I'm So tired of having crippling anxiety while also trying to be a full time parent. I wish I could give up, but we have to keep going."
SuicideWatch,fcvpkqd,t3_eis7xd,1578007220.0,Meh. I feel like that right now. I kinda want to go to sleep forever but not really die.. ya know ?
Anxiety,fcvpfe3,t3_ej29di,1578007125.0,I dont even work yet (been a stay at home mom for years) but I know within the next few months I have to start working. And it gives me anxiety because even without working I hardly have time to do things I want to do. I feel like I'm always cleaning up after my little ones or running errands. How do people do it? Idk how I will do it! I feel like I wont have time to really do anything. I'm scared. Theres people who work a full time job and also go to school and i wonder how do they have time for anything?
TooAfraidToAsk,fctmdz5,t3_eisqt8,1577948810.0,I'm 26 and still feel this exact same way! I think I am more scared and worried of adulthood than when I was 18. I hate being an adult.
driving,fcjkmo2,t3_ehho7q,1577691443.0,Honestly with me parking didnt come naturally! I've been driving for a while and I still am not great at it. Reverse parking is still so hard for me but I've only tried it once. Maybe look up some videos on YouTube to help you out. Some people get it quickly and some take a little more time its ok
sanantonio,fc7pmto,t3_egiwrj,1577515319.0,I thought he had a cigarette in his mouth
mentalillness,fb4m0uo,t3_ebf6rn,1576511455.0,"I drive because I have to. Not because I want to. If I could avoid driving for the rest of my life, I would! When I first started driving I had a small wreck. Which took almost a year to get back into the drivers seat. I have gotten a lot more comfortable with it but I still have so much anxiety. I will probably never drive on the highway. And I hardly ever drive on really busy roads. My anxiety goes thru the roof. If I need to go somewhere far I usually try to avoid it as much as possible and have my husband or my mom take me. It sucks. Most people in my family started driving at 16 and were never scared so I feel like no one understands. I dont have any advice all I can say is if you really want to start driving again just be careful, maybe put on some music to calm you down (that always helps me) I would start in an empty parking lot. Just stay in that parking lot until you feel a little comfortable then try to drive down regular roads. Practice and get the feel of the car all over again just like if you were just learning how to drive"
