BipolarReddit,ffi5vf5,t3_etox7y,1579965904.0,"I was prescribed 25mg Seroquel while in hospital and had a complete temper tantrum over it. My anxiety over meds is out of control and yes, I figured it would kill me in my sleep. 

I had the best sleep if my life. In the morning I was getting my breakfast and felt like I was going to pass out. Nurses caught my blood pressure dropping. This terrified me and I vowed never to touch the stuff again. 

Fast forward a few months and I’m in such a horrible mixed state I text my pdoc BEGGING for it. I took half this time (12.5mg-instant release) and was completely fine. I only take as needed now but it’s literally saved my life numerous times. 

I did a lot of research about the dying part and the strongest correlation I could find was it being over prescribed in hospitals for sleep when patients were already on a cocktail of dangerous meds prone to bad interactions with Seroquel. Your pharmacist will be about to check to make sure everything you’re taking interacts safely together. In fact, they probably wouldn’t have filled your prescription if their was a high chance of bad interactions. (Not sure where you are-this is my experience in Canada). 


TL;DR - I literally have panic attacks over meds and take Seroquel as needed. Dying (rare) seems to be connected to bad med combinations."
bipolar2,ffbfvd6,t3_esp27h,1579763470.0,"When I first started lamictal I developed a rash once I hit 100mg. Everyone freaked out. My psychiatrist didn’t think it looked like “the rash” but still took me off of it cold turkey. 

I tried several different meds over the next 6 months and eventually begged my psychiatrist to let me try it again because I felt like it had the most potential with the least side effects. 

I started taking it again in October, this like much slower and again, developed another rash at 100mg. This time I was sent to the ER where a dermatologist confirmed it wasn’t “the rash”. Turns out there’s just something about it that makes me a little itchy and I tend to get a small rash. 

The dermatologist explained a lot about Stevens Johnson’s Syndrome and really put me at ease. I live in a major city, and this was at the top rated hospital. This dermatologist had never seen anyone with SJS from lamictal in her 25 years of working there. 

So yes, the bad rash is EXTREMELY rare. And just because you get a rash while taking lamictal doesn’t mean it’s one you need to worry about (but obviously check to be sure). You need to watch out for blisters and they typically start in your mouth or groin area. They’re very distinct (google pictures to know what to watch for). And if this does happen to you .. you get medical treatment and stop taking it ASAP before it has a chance to get bad. 

I’m still taking lamictal, I’m finally at 150mg and am not nervous about the rash whatsoever. For me the benefits of this drug far outweigh the very small possibility of actually getting the rash. I know what to look out for and to act fast. I’d give it a try, it could be a great med for you :)"
bipolar,ffarma9,t3_escxjq,1579742869.0,"This is amazing! I’ve just gone back to school and am really struggling, not academically, more like it’s sent me into a mixed episode. 

I’m amazed at the accommodations! I really need to talk to my school. 

Awesome job advocating for yourself and all the best luck with your studies :)"
