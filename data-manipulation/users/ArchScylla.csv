AskReddit,fdrgvjf,t1_fdqrw7q,1578684370.0,"I just automatically know who my serial laters are, and I give them different times for things. Movie starts at 7? No, i tell them it starts at 6. Not only are they late, they're too lazy to check. 
Dinner starting at 7? I tell them 5. Because not only do they think they're not late, dinners and parties mean you should be ""fashionably late"" adding another hour. (Which is the stupidest ""rule"" I have ever heard of).

There are a few people who I just stopped inviting to things though and gave them three chances to be on time or I was done. The few I have the above method for are people who come through when I genuinely need them, so the adjustment is worth it. Everyone else can sod off, by an alarm and learn to use it to stop wasting literally everyone else's time."

I can highly recommend Pratchett, and I love Neil Gaiman as a story teller. I'm a sucker for classics like Lord of the flies, 1984, animal farm, brave new world.

People who say reading is boring or pointless just haven't read the right book. A few friends of mine weren't readers and i gottem with Pratchett. some with comic books or graphic novels. But sometimes it's easier to just not associate with them. Stick to the cool cats who like reading."

""If you haven't read it yet, please don't freak out because it's huge or considered by some people as boring...first of all, now you are the right age to read it. This book is about life. It's about everything that happens in life: love, family, friendship, death...and because it has so many characters I think it shows the best how unpredictable and multifaceted that life can be. I loved how it doesn't divide actions in to right or wrong. It just shows how different people are, what they feel, their real thoughts... But the main reason I love this book: it is about love."""

There's a bit of fall out from the pan, but that doesn't bother me too much. The colour saturation and pigmentation is actually ok in this pallet! Blending takes a while, and because I'm pale the colours are a bit deeper on the skin than in the pan. But it's ok!"

AskReddit,fact7ft,t3_e8kgy3,1575946458.0,"I use to work for a ""charity"" who would ""adopt a kid"" or ""provide for a family"". Part of our marketing tactic was to shit talk the dollar value of other ""charities"" and explain how much of their dollar would go to the CEO instead of the family. We then had a completely bullshit set of ""statistics and facts"" for the company we worked for that made us sound better. ""Well, instead of every 76c to the dollar going to the CEO, we've flipped that number! For the first five years of your donating, 76c to the dollar goes to the child or family! How great is that!"" 

We were paid commission only, always paid late if at all, and I ended up on top of that pyramid scheme of lies for about 6 months with a team of 6 people under me. Because I was a team leader I'd be paid a comission from my teams sales too. I was paid to travel around my country touting this rubbish and convincing people to sign up and claim it back on tax. 

Usually these types of charities absolutely do take a large portion of each dollar to pay the workers and management, but after a while the dollars move to the family the longer people stay. The issue is most people don't stay long enough for it to have been worth it, despite most Aussies claiming their donation back on tax."
