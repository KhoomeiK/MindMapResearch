There is no dodging the question when the question doesn’t even have a real answer to begin with. Because I could sit here all day saying I am the most fantastic and least boring person there is, but are you ever going to believe me? 

Quit with the “witty” rebuttals because they add nothing to the ultimate question of this piece, and you’re even ignoring my original response. You are trying to change the goal post without even making an argument of your own. That is why youre arguing in bad faith.

I will also add that because you’re arguing in bad faith, what purpose is there to even having a discussion with you? You’ve made your mind, you can fucking keep it."

TwoXChromosomes,fef2chz,t1_feey23m,1579046529.0,"This is a common theme I’ve been seeing in some of these controversial comments. I don’t think it’s about how men hear women speaking, I don’t think it’s because women use to many words to say one thing, I think it’s because these men just don’t care about what their partners are saying. That’s it. They’re making excuses, but if they cared I’m sure they would make a bigger effort to actually hear them."
