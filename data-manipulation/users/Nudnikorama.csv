Whatcouldgowrong,fei6ewf,t1_fei4lq8,1579131308.0,Nope not currently. I'm living in a big city and it's far from optimal conditions. I would love to though. My father had dogs and I was raised surrounded by them. I know it's heartbreaking to have tu out down a dog but it's also important to consider people outside of your private circle. Could have been a kid instead of an Instagram teenager.

I read someone was comparing dogs to wolves, faire enough. But they also could be compared to guns. If the dog (especially smart and powerful dogs like German shepards) is not very carefully educated, it can very easily turn into a lethal weapon. A dog doesn't bite the face of a friend of mine in my house. Or my backyard."
Whatcouldgowrong,fei0mv4,t3_ep47t7,1579127708.0,Yeah... They should have put it down though. I love dogs but they absolutely can't hurt humans especially in a non hostile context.
