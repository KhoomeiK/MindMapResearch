AskReddit,ffvsvmc,t1_ffv288z,1580272289.0,"There are laws on the books to regulate the *wattage* of headlights, but not the actual lumens emitted. Modern LED headlights demand fewer watts than incandescent bulbs from the 1970s, but obviously modern LEDs emit more light. Hopefully state lawmakers will catch up and lay down regulations on lumens because this can only become more ridiculous."
ElderScrolls,ffvmpo0,t1_ffu3atf,1580267764.0,"That kinda sounds like the premise of [The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_Adventures%3A_Redguard?wprov=sfla1). It's still chronologically the earliest game in the series.

There's also [Battlespire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Elder_Scrolls_Legend%3A_Battlespire?wprov=sfla1). Apparently they were working on Reguard, Battlespire, and Morrowind *simultaneously.*"
ElderScrolls,ffvledq,t1_ffulr8h,1580266863.0,"I think Fallout compares well to Star Wars.

The original Fallout is A New Hope. The main attraction is the impressive amount of world-building. Looking back, perhaps it was not the best or most complex, but **-boom!-** a new, exciting world was born!

Fallout 2 is Robot Chicken: Star Wars. It's particularly clever, raunchy, and dark. It incorporates everything from the original source material and does unexpected things.

Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel is Attack of the Clones. Instead of a meaningful story you have a surplus of action in the form of super soldiers going around and shooting things.

Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel is the Star Wars Holiday Special. It's *just wrong* and *you shouldn't like it.* Its very existence is unknown to many.

Fallout 3 is The Phantom Menace. It's a new and exciting chapter with a fresh style! It's fun and the kids love it, but the older fans are embarrassed or pissed off.

Fallout: New Vegas is The Empire Strikes Back. It moves forward with a dark story and the dialogue is particularly memorable. Many people say it's the best one.

Fallout 4 is The Force Awakens. The hype is incredible, but then many complain that it's uninspired and about as deep as a paper plate. Nonetheless, it does try out some new things.

Fallout 76 is The Last Jedi. It's a bungled mess with a stupid name. The shameless plummet in quality made many fans skeptical of the future."
ElderScrolls,ffvbmm5,t1_ffug2j4,1580260299.0,"To the west, there is the New California Republic: the stumbling democratic state fighting to expand its influence and tame the Mojave. To the east, there is the cunning Caesar and his Legion: countless footsoldiers and slaves stolen from the 86 broken tribes of the canyons and plains beyond.

In the narrowing distance between these two forces there are three things. First: there is the Hoover Dam and the coveted water of the Colorado River. Second: there is New Vegas- the old, heathen city controlled and protected by the enigmatic Mr. House. Third: there is you with a bullet in your brain.

**+** Fallout: New Vegas boasts approximately 65,000 lines of dialogue, and many of these are delivered by its [star-studded cast](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706601/).

**+** The writing is top-notch. Though arguably it contains a *minor* spoiler for some of the background lore in the Honest Hearts DLC, [Randall Clark's diary](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Randall_Clark_terminal_entries) of survival provides a great example of the caliber of storytelling present in the game."

The *team* at Mojang evolved Minecraft from its humble beginnings as an Infiniminer clone, but both Mojang and Microsoft have since cut him off from his baby. He's been uninvited from official events like Minecon. Money can make good games, but developing great games takes some amount of playful spirit and camaraderie. Notch's game brought so much joy to the world and brought him much of its money, and yet he seems to be a miserable, hateful ass. I wish that were not the case."

Notch does have an [unfortunate history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Persson#Controversies) of being an idiot though. If he were a kind, decent person he could be working with a big, talented studio designing whatever crazy vision he might have... but in reality he's a jerk, and the best concepts in Minecraft were lifted from Dwarf Fortress anyway."
