selfimprovement,ffbdjn9,t3_es9623,1579760767.0,"I applaud you on your journey and I hope you succeed in your goals, but I worry about your daily goals. Don't set yourself up for failure, work up to these goals gradually. If you were even 1% better than who you were yesterday, that's still an improvement. If you fail to do these goals per day, it's **not** an excuse to stop and wallow. Just do it the next day."

unpopularopinion,ff7o3se,t3_es45pl,1579654209.0,"Catholicism isn't a blanket term for Christianity. The Old Testament is also Jewish, not Christian. This is low tier reddit atheism, can you come up with some original insults?"
4chan,ff0xkhg,t1_ff0evpq,1579473294.0,Looking at specifically and only race in terms of determining birth rate is intellectually dishonest. Rich blacks have fewer kids. Rich whites have fewer kids. Not every issue is so black and white lmao

The whitest states have the highest fertility rate. Sorry to burst your bubble pal"
4chan,fezts63,t1_fewm1ku,1579461561.0,"Oh yes focus on ethnic makeup when poverty and population is incredibly low :O 

Only race matters LOL"
selfimprovement,fepix6f,t1_fepdcr1,1579321676.0,If all you're looking for is reasons to not try or lost opportunities that's all you'll ever find. Stop your pity party.
selfimprovement,feoh6e1,t1_feoe2p9,1579300042.0,"I struggle very badly with depression. I tried to kill myself in 2017 and spent a month in an inpatient facility. I was NOT lucky. I accepted the fact that nobody could save me from depression and I had to save myself. So I tried, and failed, but I kept trying. Nothing about it was easy. You're making excuses and are holding yourself back. Have some accountability."
selfimprovement,feo9oa8,t1_feo440k,1579297050.0,"Woe is you, pal. Throw yourself a pity party or make an effort."
selfimprovement,fenm6kr,t1_fenlcfx,1579287660.0,But you can. The only thing stopping you is yourself. Why not try to try?
selfimprovement,fenec2i,t1_fen40gl,1579282863.0,"Exactly. I even sometimes work up to it, like I'll do the dishes or clean my room or do my laundry, and it'll get me in an active mindset where I won't want to stop."
selfimprovement,fendqv9,t1_femze31,1579282501.0,Stop thinking and force yourself to do the first 5%. Get out of your own head and neuroticism and you'll be surprised.
4chan,fe5w6h6,t3_enlfer,1578876306.0,"If only this ebic doomzoomer would realize that it's a good thing that he's able to hold a conversation and have friends. Most aspies don't have the courage to even message their crush but if you're able to hold a convo and keep em coming back that means you can do it to others in the future. Literally a positive thing. Ebic ""doomers"" just gotta be angry tho right"
eu4,fdvip3p,t1_fduui92,1578747829.0,"You are going to want to focus on religious groups first to balance AE. This isn't my advice, this is from Florryworry who is known for bullshit crazy strats. If you eat all the Muslims first, Christians and Easterners won't care. You don't want a world-size coalition."
AskReddit,fdh327j,t3_eldq7m,1578414315.0,Sobriety has some good highs.
AntiSemitismInReddit,fdegbam,t1_fdefuwj,1578338402.0,I don't see how that's relevant. More Muslim countries have expelled Jews than Christian ones. Protestants expelled more Jews but Catholics slaughtered many more.
AntiSemitismInReddit,fdefjsq,t1_fdef3fq,1578337927.0,"Radhanite traders and money-lenders were prime candidates to seize their assets and expel them from your country. Christians would literally set up Jews in positions where they could commit usury purely for Christians to profit.

What other reason would you suggest?"
KGATLW,fde2bi6,t3_ekvxf2,1578329592.0,"Looking for posters. Polygondwanaland variants or Nonagon.

AntiSemitismInReddit,fddfds7,t1_fdd24bq,1578309781.0,"109 countries, with like roughly 70% of them being small german cities in the Holy Roman Empire during it's wake. It's a dogwhistle, protestants have been kicked out significantly more."
selfimprovement,fda64nk,t3_ekc0wk,1578242224.0,"The best thing for me is to generate momentum. Have a huge work report or essay you need to do? Start small, I'll tidy my desk or clean my room or do a simple chore. Generally you will want to continue to keep active and continue being productive, since it feels so good. You work your way up to it. 


The typical cycle of (inspiration -> motivation -> action) is not linear. Action can inspire motivation which leads to more action."

KGATLW,fcwlckt,t1_fcw3bv8,1578028839.0,They're so underground I can't even find the lyrics to a ton of their songs online. I can see why they're not mainstream but they're still rad as hell.
KGATLW,fcw13yp,t1_fct66jb,1578014716.0,Wand is so good. This seems like s pipe dream sadly :(
fasting,fctjmzz,t1_fcs2v3c,1577945605.0,"I would say cleanse with water instead of juice. It can be healthy to consume fruits rich in antioxidants but it's not by much. Your body has kidneys and the liver to ""detox"" and cleanse your body."

4chan,fclld1c,t1_fcin3f6,1577750487.0,"It's a holocaust denial joke. Jokes on them though, the metal doors on the actual chambers are still there and the chambers with ""wooden doors"" placed were used by the Red Army as bombshelters."
AskReddit,fc3mhvt,t3_eg0qli,1577393234.0,There is still good in the world.
