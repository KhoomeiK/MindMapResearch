TheWestEnd,feo73of,t1_fenwpkf,1579295976.0,"Yes, it's & Juliet. I held off going for so long, because I guess I'm a little snobbish about ""jukebox musicals"", but all the praise finally wore me down and I went last week.

From the opening, where the dancers walk on stage in dribs and drabs, warming up, stretching, chatting to the first row, to the fantastic story and characters.

What's amazing is how well they used the songs at their disposal. You just have to hear the musical lead in to a song and the audience cracks up, because they know the song, they get why it's appropriate to the scene and they lose their minds.

Just wait until you see how they use ""Oops! I did it again"" -- It's pure comedy gold.

Miriam-Teak Lee as Juliet is a force of nature. She has an amazing voice, she's a terrific dancer and, let's be honest, her actual physical presence is something to behold.

Cassidy Janson as Anne Hathaway is the comic heart of the show. You simply cannot not love her.

On the plus side for audience members on a budget, there seemed to be a lot of free ticket upgrades happening on the night.

Go see it."

TheWestEnd,fcv57b0,t3_ej0z3b,1577994888.0,"Seems to be a bit of a dark theme in your list of shows. I haven't seen DEH yet, they're not discounting.  Phantom won't be cheap. Jamie seems to always have rush seats available (limit of 2) so you might consider leaving off pre-booking there. Six is fun and very cheap. 

If you want something a bit lighter for your family, consider Mary Poppins. You may have seen the movie 10 times, but the show is so much better and Zizi Strallen might be the most delightful musical star on the West End today."
TheWestEnd,fcq8ak0,t3_eih2fa,1577880852.0,"Well I liked it a lot more than she did. I went in knowing very little. It sounded like Noises Off plus a few songs. In fact, it was a full on musical. The cast was universally great, there were lots of songs, more than you might have imagined in a plot-driven story and the dancing was top tier. I hadn't been expecting much since it was really a fill-in for the the very early closing Man in the White Suit, but I came out of it a huge fan. It's amazing to me that this show is so obscure."

TheWestEnd,fcnqcqw,t3_ei5ga0,1577816442.0,"Re: Cyrano -- That's at the Playhouse Theatre, which is very near Embankment station. Imagine you're looking at the front entrance. Turn left and walk down the side street which runs beside the theatre. You actually walk past the end of the theatre and there's a kind of wrought iron gate with stairs leading downwards. It's just before a driveway that leads down into what I think is a garage under the next building. 

Pretty sure there's a Stage Door sign too."

He’d condemned a brave man to death. A little girl to grow up without the father she adored. But Doctor Strange could still save Tony Stark. Endgame Fix-It.

### Notes:

>Avengers: Endgame broke me. It really did. So I needed to fix it because Morgan deserves to grow up with her daddy. Tony deserves his rest, at home, with his family.
