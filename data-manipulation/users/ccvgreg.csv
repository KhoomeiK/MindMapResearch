worldnews,fgubm2a,t1_fgua4ho,1581116887.0,"I don't understand this line of reasoning. If we impeach again, it only serves to further the public knowledge of the scope and severity of his actions in office. It will also further implicate the GOP shine a glaring light on their complicity before elections. I guarantee anyone who truly understands what's happening and wants it to stop won't just not show up to the ballot box because they tried to impeach again and got burnt out on the news. The goal would be to get more of those people who may not understand what's happening, but would want it to stop, to understand what's happening.

Roadcam,fgraads,t1_fgqzqn6,1581041951.0,"I get what you're saying but if you spent a few weeks traveling my commute you would understand. The former example isn't really a zipper lane so much as it is a right turn only lane (the latter example being a clearly marked right turn only lane) with no markings anywhere. So imagine some nutjob trying to bum rush past you and all the open space behind you after the dotted line goes away at 15+ over the speed limit, meanwhile someone is slowing down to turn right up ahead, so the idiot dodges a slow turning vehicle to barely squeak an inch in front of your bumper.

Roadcam,fgqy2ki,t1_fgqrklu,1581033929.0,That's all fun and games until some nutjob tries passing you from a football field away in the merge lane. I swear like every other commute there's someone so impatient they will fly up like the devil in the zipper merge area and try to overtake all the cars. Doesn't matter if it's backed up traffic they will ignore all openings that aren't at the front of the line. Then they honk at you like *you're* the asshole. There's also a left turn only lane that people do this in by my job. It's infuriating to deal with on a daily basis.

The book you're reading is just getting good, and your pal is curled up by your side as the sun gets low in the sky. As it dips below the trees, the light that filters through the leaves splays up the hill, and puts on the most spectacular show; as if for you personally, to bid you goodnight.

But guess what, we can still curtail our emissions while retaining a capitalist economy. Who knows if Greta understands this but that doesn't make her wrong to advocate for two things.
