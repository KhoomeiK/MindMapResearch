I guess in that regard I was lucky to find a pretty good church with a lot of great people. But I’m sorry to hear you’ve had bad experiences with Christians that made you feel worthless. There are a lot of shitty people out there, whatever they’re beliefs.

Great reply, I appreciate so much of what you say and can see your viewpoint. Especially what you said above, as a lot of my fellowship in the church was based on the fact that these people generally cared about me and wanted the best for me. So I felt I should give them the same amount of respect back. But in my experience, I realized these people were indoctrinated in the church since an early age, and it didn't matter what I said, it wouldn't get through to them. Everything was always bought back to how you should trust in God and pray and believe in the bible. That's why I had to cut off all contact with them. It was like speaking to a brick wall. I'm sure many here can relate to the ""christian bubble"" and how it's almost impossible trying to have a reasonable conversation with them, but it's just like they have their fingers in their ears.

I just feel you can be respectful while setting boundaries. What worked for me would, might not work for others, as we're all in different situations. I was just blunt and told my church friends I was no longer a believer and was uncomfortable talking about it further and asked to them to please respect my decision. I told them I respect their beliefs, so please respect mine. It wasn't an easy process, but as you say, the worst that comes out of it, is that they pray for you. Again, I just think that meeting with pastors and church officials shows you're still ""open to it"" and willing to be ""reconverted"". They'll keep on clinging onto you and try to save you as much as they can (even with good intentions) and I find it best just not to engage with them. Hope it doesn't sound too cold, but I think when it comes to religion you just have to put your foot down."

I was the same. Smoked to curb my anxiety, smoked so I could get through life. But eventually you reach a point in life where you realize you just can't do it anymore. Relying on a crutch to fill your void only makes the void deeper and so you just keep smoking to fill that void. It's a never ending cycle. I don't what its like to have an addict spouse, but I am also an alcoholic. Since I've quit weed I've been dealing with my alcoholism. My mom is also an alcoholic so I kinda understand how you feel. Are you able to see a therapist? If you see a good one, they can make a world of difference. I wish I had more advice for you, but I just wanted you to know I sympathize with you. Addiction is a bitch, and it takes not only great willpower but great great resistance is necessary. I think if you get help for your husband it will help take the load off of you and the feeling of needing to take the edge off.

That was something that I wanted to highlight in the replies. Although my former pastor is against homosexuality, I don't seem him as a bad person, just very conflicted. He was against homosexuality, yet can still love and support his daughter, who is gay. That just shows me that he is human and is better than the god he preaches. If he is a true man of God, that believes the scriptures he preaches, then shouldn't his daughter be stoned to death?

What's more likely, that the Christian God exists and is as evil as he is in the Book of Job, or that this was a story made up by ancient humans?

I think there's a lot of truth to this, but Christianity is such a large religion that it's hard to pin people down. All I know is that with my church, the people I met there were very nice and accommodating. I suffer from mental illness and in my struggle I decided to confide in some about what I was going through. These people took the time out of their day to listen to me and offer their support. Although, it was the support that was the problem - it was all pray to God and read your Bible and he will give you the answers  (at one bible study there was an argument because some older guy said the answer to drug addiction is Jesus, while another who volunteered at addiction centres, argued that what they needed is treatment and understanding).

So I don't believe that the majority of Christians that I met only had superficial kindness. They genuinely cared about me and people and wanted to help - but unfortunately, it was all in the name of God. So looking back at my time with the church, I'm conflicted, I agree with what you say, yet in many ways, following the ways of Jesus is what led them to be nicer, more compassionate people.

This is what started my weed addiction. There were so many less side effects to weed compared with alcohol that I'd smoke myself stupid. I'm an alcoholic and weed was just a bandaid - substituting one drug for another. If you're having the same problems with weed as you did with alcohol, I'd say you have the brain of an addict. It fucking sucks man, we have that part of our brain that always wants to use, always telling us to use more. I'd suggest you see a therapist and get to the root of your problems, but as much as I hate to say it, once an addict, always an addict. There's no such thing as moderation for us. It's nothing to be ashamed of, it's just the way our brains are wired.

I don't work in fast food but totally relate with this. Recently our biggest slacker got Employee of the Month. SMH the managers are a bunch of dimwits."

Find different things you're interested in whether it be reading, listening to music, playing an instrument, going for a walk. Being 6 months sober, I read my first novel in years a few weeks ago. I consider it a huge accomplishment. I also love to go for long walks around my town for hours, it just gets me out of my head. Even if it's binge watching some show on Netflix, it's all about re-training your brain to find other avenues of pleasure besides smoking weed."

I'm 6 months sober and find the same thing. My cravings are kicking in bad, so I come here everyday and at least post as much as I come. This is my therapy, nothing else helps me like this sub does. When I feel the craving, I focus my mind on all the negatives weed bought to my life and it keeps me from relapsing."
