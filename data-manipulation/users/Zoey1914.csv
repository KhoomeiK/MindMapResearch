A loving and rational deity would not create imperfect humans and then throw them in a fucking oven forever for being imperfect. And killing his son(who is also himself) is supposed to make up for us being 'sinful'? Wut?


Please. The only reason anyone believes any of this complete and total lunacy is because they've been throughly brainwashed."
rant,ffj53wt,t3_etwwfq,1579990626.0,Well I mean it's no different from any other major religion. Majority of humans lack critical thinking skills..nothing new.
atheism,ffiqkmj,t1_ffi3g7a,1579980239.0,"There are plenty of orphans (without parents) who've suffered and died as well. There are young children who've been tortured/murdered by their psychopath parents who didn't give a single shit about them too. Who is learning some fucked lesson here? 
You ignored my point about animals. The entire system is cruel. You have all these sentient creatures(that experience pain) on this planet living short, brutal lives and eating/ tearing each other apart in order to survive. Omnipotent deity wouldn't have had to make it this way. So he's either not all powerful or gets off on suffering. 

The simplest answer here is that humans could not accept that life is chaotic and finite. There is no reward for suffering so they invented one."
atheism,ffhj4t2,t1_ffhaspw,1579937600.0,">I know it doesn't go with everyone's belief but God isn't anti science, science is part of the creation and mathematical occurrences of things. Its not easy to hear and I am sorry for what you are facing and I fully understand lashing out at God because if God exists in your time of trouble he has to be targeting you like that jerk kid with a magnifying glass.

The issue is that there is no scientific evidence for the existence of your god. You are mistaken to think I am lashing out at something that doesn't exist. I do not believe in your god for the exact same reason you do not believe in Zeus, Thor, Mithra or Allah. 
I'm at peace with there being no god and having a finite life. I give credit to and thank the doctors and scientists for giving my father a chance at more life. He likely would not have had this chance 50 years ago. 

I'm not at peace with people in my life assuming that I share their beliefs and/or pushing their beliefs on me. I never stated that I ""hated"" people for saying they are praying for us. I said I appreciated their good intentions, but it was a bit bothersome. And the praying doesn't bother me anywhere near as much as the blatantly religious cards and believers saying things like, ""god will heal him"" or ""there's a plan/everything happens for a reason"" That is not comforting to me or my family. I only want my (and my family's) lack of belief respected."
atheism,ffhi077,t1_ffhftat,1579936117.0,"Everyone vents on the internet, get off your high horse lol.
Today my boss told me that ""god loves"" me ""even though it may not seem like it"" Does this sound very professional to you? People can comfort my family without pushing their beliefs, it's not difficult. And believe me, these same people would be uber pissed if a Muslim told them that Allah would cure their loved ones of an illness. 

Atheism and agnosticism are not mutually exclusive. Agnostic/gnostic pertains to knowledge (I know/don't know) and theism/atheism pertains to belief/nonbelief (I believe/don't believe) Therefore, one can either identify as agnostic atheist/theist or gnostic atheist/theist.

I'm agnostic atheist. It's pretty simple. I dont know with 100 percent certainty of course, but there's no reason to believe. Believing in a god or gods is equivalent to believing in fairies or unicorns."

Why create freewill at all? What's the point? According to your beliefs, you spend eternity in paradise without sin anyways.

 A measly 80yrs(give or take) is nothing compared to forever. So god could've just skipped this whole earth experiment."
atheism,ffhfyi9,t1_ffhc4bd,1579933599.0,"This does not explain why very young children (who are incapable of understanding god) or animals are inflicted with pain/suffering. Also, don't you think this is rather messed up? God creates the conditions which cause you suffering because he wants you to rely on him more? It sounds like an unhealthy and abusive relationship."
atheism,ffhfo14,t1_ffhchkp,1579933262.0,"Exactly! I don't understand how people find this comforting at all. It's downright disturbing. I'll take a mortal, finite life over being a slave to this dictator deity. 

Living forever doesn't sound appealing either. I'd like us to have longer lifespans with less suffering sure, but eternity would be maddening."

atheism,ffgjq8m,t1_ffgitlj,1579907817.0,"That's a weak comparison. If my brand new car broke down unexpectedly, I'd probably blame the manufacturers/car company for making a faulty car. If a god exists, it should get the blame for creating humans with severely flawed biological systems."

atheism,fffds5d,t1_fffavmz,1579881742.0,That's super fucked up. It just reaffirms my opinion that many believers just believe and 'love' their god out of fear. God is basically a celestial dictator that can hear everyone's thoughts. And they're deathly afraid of offending him.

They're already chalking up his progress to their prayers. No one ever gives credit where credit is due either. Ironically, my boss's (who gave us the religious cards) dad had the exact same cancer decades ago and his prognosis was very grim from the get go(he didn't survive) It is only because of advancements in medicine/science that my father has a good prognosis.

Celiac,fep0lff,t3_eq98vk,1579309465.0,"Welcome:)
I've been gluten free for nearly 4 years and it was very difficult at first, but you will adapt. It does get easier overtime. Eating out still sucks since it's so risky, but I've learned to cook. Pretty much anything you want to eat, can be modified to be gf. 

I was extremely ill before and it took me months to start feeling completely healthy. I made a lot of mistakes starting out too. It's very important that you are strictly gluten free if you have celiac. This means no cross contamination. You can get easily glutened if you share a kitchen with others and don't take precautions/clean surfaces. It's hidden in many foods as well. Since it is not really an allergy but an autoimmune illness, even a crumb can cause a reaction. If I'm accidentally 'glutened' now, I feel terrible for at least 3 days. 

Also, you may want to avoid dairy for awhile until your gut heals.  Celiacs can be lactose intolerant after the villi in their intestine become damaged (this will grow back after gluten is removed for a period of time)

I was angry in the beginning and I felt like I was betrayed by my body too. But just remember there are far worse things. The diet is all worth it to not feel sick."
