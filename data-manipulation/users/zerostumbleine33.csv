dogs,fdx576w,t1_fdu3q1v,1578765479.0,Thank you! Omg I would have loved to see that! I have two jack russells and they certainly do not listen that well hahaha.

I feel the same way about my dog Kora. My husband and I are always talking about how photogenic she is and how she's a rescue but literally who would ever give up such a perfect beautiful dog?! She will be standing and looking at something inquisitively, with one paw up, and we're like ""how is she so majestic?!"" seriously, we're always looking at her just thinking how pretty she is and perfect lol. We had our dog in our engagement photos and she was in our wedding, so we got so many special photos with her and us.
