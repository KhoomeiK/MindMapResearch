mudfossils,ffa7vdc,t1_ffa6pgd,1579729592.0,"For a lot of it, yes, I freely admit that I am taking it on faith. Difference is I've looked at some of the key studies & bits of evidence for ice core samples from millions of years ago having contained enough oxygen to suggest that the atmosphere of the paleozoic era contained enough oxygen to support large flora & fauna. I've then looked at the vast other amounts of peer-reviewing & other studies into the same field of study which propose to confirm this theory, and since that's simply more data than I can possibly look at all by myself I take it on faith that at least most of it is accurate, because in the scientific community results are rarely published in journals without multiple people having already looked at the evidence and concluding that it's of sound logic & reasoning.  
I don't need to show you this, because that's not the argument here. That's *already* the current scientific concensus. Look it up yourself.

We can't experience the past but we can look at ice core samples to measure the oxygen content of the air millions of years ago.

That's a fish the size of France you're proposing. The Earth is simply nowhere near large enough to have ever been able to support life that huge at any point in its history.  
What you're looking at, in my personal opinion, is an ancient seabed. There's plenty of geological evidence to suggest that there was an inland sea in the north of Africa 12,000+ years ago and that following the YD period it drained out to the west with the shifting of the Earth's crust."
