I have it on good authority that dwarven ""beer"" is just straight vodka, hence its reputation among the lesser races. Wine? From carrots? Ridiculous. Potatoes are a much better crop for a hard working peoples like the dwarves. High caloric return per acreage, grow well at altitude, and you can make vodka out of them. Your first mistake was assuming that hearty dwarves would ever drink anything less than 80 proof. YOU FOOL! These are dwarves we're talking about. Pints of potato vodka, straight up. Trust me, I'm a walrus."
unpopularopinion,fetiw8s,t1_fet04gh,1579375903.0,"Dude you completely missed the point. Kids AREN'T necessarily killing themselves at a higher rate, it's just being accurately recorded for the first time. As example, 30 years ago a kid committs suicide and the officials label it as ""accidental"" death to avoid bringing ""shame"" or whatever on the family. Today it gets accurately recorded as a suicide. Behavior is the same, recording is different. Centuries ago mental illness wasn't widespread because IT DIDN'T EXIST YET. That's like saying the ancient Roman's never got sick because there are no confirmed bacterial or virus cases. That's not because Rome was mad healthy, it's because they didn't have germ theory. Where did all these black holes in space come from? We didn't see them in the historical record, so there must be some sort of phenomenon going on right? Yeah, the invention of better telescopes. If you can read between the lines it is readily apparent that the historical record is absolutely chock full of mental illness being played out in various forms. The map is not the territory and all that."

Showerthoughts,fe31nfd,t1_fe2v4pu,1578845086.0,"Dude you've completely missed all context. Think of the title. The hypothetical person condoning suffering has already suffered, encouraging the continued suffering of others.  This at least implies the seniority of the origional sufferer. Now who is a senior in a relationship that has a say on what the juniors experiences are? OP's showerthought isn't even origional, it's a pretty common sentiment these days. And nobody is talking about general life hardships, they're talking about abuse. It doesn't have to be parental, but that's the most common form people experience so it becomes the ""default"" reference. We live in a society. Try and keep up."
Showerthoughts,fe2y39m,t1_fe2sv32,1578844113.0,"Ok, if you don't assume without evidence that OP is a dumb little shit then it's pretty obvious what they're refering to; the same kind of abuse that people are always referencing when they quote the overdone line in OP's title. But please, if that's to complicated then make yourself feel better by painting an unflattering strawman of OP. Clearly, using context and argueing in good faith are beyond your abilities."
Showerthoughts,fe2wggq,t1_fe2s8ij,1578843634.0,"So do you REALLY think OP's point is that people who chop wood with an ax and shit like that are somehow maladjusted? OR maybe other people hear the phrase ""it's good for them"" in the context of emotionally disturbed motherfuckers perpetrating the cycle of abuse, and it's pretty obvious OP is referring to this phenomenon and not the practice of using a manual toothbrush. Then again maybe I am overestimating your intelligence, my bad."
Showerthoughts,fe2ubvd,t1_fe2rgl8,1578842959.0,"Oh you sweet summer child. There ARE people suggesting that suffering makes a stronger person. Lots of them. I'm pretty sure it's you who is crafting a strawman to avoid facing the reality that so many children are abused and grow up to be abusers. And do you know what a lot of them end up saying? I'll give you a hint, it's in OPs title. So maybe shut the fuck up about things you know nothing about, yah?"
Showerthoughts,fe2tbnr,t1_fe2rnrx,1578842634.0,"No, words literally mean different things depending on context. Remember kids, if you don't have a valid arguement you can always blindly appeal to authority, but this is a DICK MOVE."

The idea is, roughly, first you declare war on distant land. Then you spend a bunch of money on the military industrial sector. Since the rich have the resources to minimize their tax payments and have some very lenient laws written on their behalf they pay less than their share, which they enjoy. This makes the industry leaders happy and they are more likely to donate money for your reelection. Lather, rinse, repeat. This also serves to destabilize neighboring regions which gives our military industrial complex more customers for their goods. Meanwhile the American people are too overworked, too complacent to educate themselves, and too wrapped up in the fantasy of our big strong government protecting us from the scary foreigners to do anything about the systemic problems that have been building up because fixing problems isnt as profitable as making guns, bombs, tanks, and planes.
