fatlogic,ffawox2,t3_esd9hw,1579746239.0,I’m officially thinner then I was in high school and a normal BMI. For the first time in a while I’m actually excited for summer and looking forward to what I can wear.
PresidentialRaceMemes,ffaom66,t1_ffadqdr,1579740855.0,That reporter's face though
AskWomen,ffao4kp,t3_esg436,1579740522.0,"This whole thing really made me reconsider my support for Warren; she was my second choice after Bernie. She's too smart of a politician to leak something like this and not understand what the fallout of it would be. Her motives are transparent considering the timing and how her team framed the whole thing. 

My support for him has only gone up after this and I recently registered as a democrat just so I could vote for him in the primaries."
PresidentialRaceMemes,ff861es,t3_es60n3,1579666982.0,This was a dumb shitty thing to say but I honestly would have more respect for her if she stood her ground. There's not a genuine thing about her.

AskWomen,ff0i0bg,t3_er1rio,1579469063.0,The thing that bothers me the most is the pet names so when my coworkers call me 'sweetheart' or 'honey' I reply 'You're welcome toots' in my best 1920's mobster voice. It makes them laugh and they've stopped doing it for the most part so win win.
unpopularopinion,ff0fwd8,t1_ff0dbfp,1579468526.0,Happy belated bday Gizmo
unpopularopinion,ff0fpwp,t1_ff0ckce,1579468460.0,Are you aware of who the president is?
unpopularopinion,ff030v8,t1_fezty2s,1579464655.0,"Which was my original point. I don't understand why then would it not be okay to create statue of the 9/11 terrorists? Because according to you a statue of a historical figure is just a statue and them being murders should be irrelevant to you. 


Unless maybe you're wrong and statues depicting historical figures are inherently celebratory and maybe we should also take into consideration the context in which they were erected in the first place."
unpopularopinion,fezonw8,t1_fezmidz,1579459741.0,I would argue the second also completely changed American history just as much if not more then the Civil War considering the impact it had on the rest of the world.

unpopularopinion,fezigbm,t1_fezhvje,1579457684.0,Should we put up statues of the terrorists that were involved in 9/11? It's American history right?

unpopularopinion,feobsyq,t3_eq71fe,1579297845.0,If I like the artist I want them to make enough money to keep making art. Most people don't realize artists need to make a living too.

cringe,felr3fl,t1_felqh8c,1579228880.0,A Trump / Biden debate would be fucking wild though. Just incoherent word salad and buzz words.
PresidentialRaceMemes,felh51a,t3_epofes,1579222049.0,I believe this whole thing could have been a huge misunderstanding. But to sit on this for years only to release it right before the last debate is disingenuous as hell. Warren is a very intelligent politician and she would not be so naive about the implications of leaking this information framed in this particular way.
PresidentialRaceMemes,felfwgd,t3_epscnm,1579221223.0,Lol what
AskWomen,feiqm30,t1_feinc1a,1579144753.0,Currently trying to work myself up to do the same thing.

Uveitis,fegzg4z,t1_fegxq2p,1579105936.0, That's great. Good luck with everything!
Uveitis,fegxd25,t1_fegmotp,1579104643.0,"Definitely go make an appointment with the specialist. You don't have to experience redness and pain to have inflammation in your eye. 

If you've been on drops for this long and your vision isn't back to normal that most likely means it isn't enough and an injection or steroid pack is probably needed (obviously not a doctor just speaking from experience). 

Seriously do not put this off. In a span of two years I went from 20/20 vision to legally blind in my left eye because of this disease. Even if the specialist wants to keep you on the same treatment plan as the ophthalmologist it's worth it to go to at least get a second opinion."
reddeadredemption,febwm1z,t1_feagfui,1578963549.0,"That's because Arthur has zero confidence in himself. 

He thinks he's dumb, ugly, and just a all around terrible person. We know that isn't true at all but that's the way he perceives himself."

AskReddit,fdpbka9,t1_fdpaje4,1578624531.0,"I doubt it because in context it's an innocuous comment that was completely taken out of context and stripped on its original meaning. 

I'm not saying I'm the biggest fan of her but I am saying that is insanely harmful and complete propaganda. Just like the how the 'both sides' phrase was parroted over and over again and should be called out."
AskReddit,fdp9qug,t1_fdp97g4,1578623303.0,"No? I don't obsess over her. Did you see her full speech where she infamously says, ""some people did some things""?"
AskReddit,fdp8jbz,t1_fdp6zjm,1578622505.0,How is that relevant to people taking what politicians say out of context?
AskReddit,fdp6mfp,t1_fdp3imq,1578621221.0,"Like ""some people did some things"". She was literally in the middle of a sentence."
videos,fdlrvgx,t1_fdlpop6,1578531017.0,"You're completely wrong. Nirvana released its first album in 1989 and it only sold 40,000 copies. Hole's Pretty on the Inside sold over 200,000 in 1991. 

Kurt had only met Courtney twice before Pretty on the Inside came out; so no he didn't write her first album. 

Nirvana didn't get big until Nevermind which came out after Hole's first album."
