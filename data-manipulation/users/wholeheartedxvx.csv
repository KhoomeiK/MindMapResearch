In all seriouness: this is so well-organized and thorough, it must have taken a lot of time to create. Props to putting all that tireless work into this very necessary piece!!"

bernie,ffxif4n,t3_etbjod,1580325775.0,Do you know of some evidence that Bernie is illegally funneling campaign contributions for personal use?
bernie,ffxi6d6,t3_evmgql,1580325635.0,"True.

It is maddening to hear Biden claim that he ""led the effort"" to pull troops out of Afghanistan and Iraq, and ***more*** maddening that the public doesn't even notice the lie. He pushed for war as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

CNN fact-checked his remarks about opposing the war to be ""at least misleading"" and the Washington Post gave him two ""Pinocchios"" for it."

books,ffv5m8z,t3_euvd4r,1580256232.0,"Reading takes me too long when I do one book at a time.

I find that having a book at work, a book in my bag, and a book at home at all times works better for me.

I can choose one that is best for each setting (my densest book is usually at home) and it keeps me from getting bored with one author. I make steady progress and remember what I read much more easily because the setting remains the same for each book."
books,ffv4o6e,t3_evdb3u,1580255593.0,"It can be really challenging to read for leisure when your brain is probably used to concentrating on a book in smaller chunks to complete worksheets, homework, etc.

In high school I used to stay up late every night on homework, so when I tried to read for pleasure, I would fall asleep every time purely out of habit.

Could you try browsing through the library until you find a book of essays or short stories or something with small chapters? And yes, it really has to be a book that you connect with."

Please talk to your family about your mental and physical health ASAP so you can set yourself up for success on whatever your next project is. As other commenters have pointed out, your brain cannot retain info and improve while your body is unwell.

Delaware,ffr89c1,t3_efy10l,1580152605.0,"Don't sweat it. Crime in Wilmington is rarely random. Like in every city, poverty and despair breeds localized violence, but mostly within very segregated networks of marginalized people.

If you are still afraid, simply avoid buying a home downtown. Elsmere is an affordable and quiet suburb.

I LOVE living in Wilmington. Don't let the internet stats keep you from the opportunity!"
Delaware,ffr7r8p,t1_fc3k81z,1580152293.0,"Weird take. I agree with the crime thing but vehemently disagree about the rest. DE has a really clean DoT building in New Castle with suspiciously quick service. I have literally never seen cleaner buses with more professional drivers.

Public services run very smoothly compared to everywhere else I've lived. Also idk if you have been paying attention but we're in the middle of a nationwide affordable housing crisis and a public education crisis, so it's not specific to DE.

I am a Midwestern transplant who thought I'd never settle down permanently, but Wilmington is such a good place to live that my heart has softened. I think OP will be happy here.

...And weather exists everywhere, ya weirdo."

VeganChill,ffr39bi,t3_ejk644,1580149501.0,"I wish there was an easy solution for this. It just takes finesse and a lot of practice to cook without a non-stick coating. The temperature of the burner and density of the food make it different each time.

When you first start cooking and throw your food in, I recommend gently shaking your pan from side to side regularly.

I also generally cook with broth instead of oil-- give that a shot and see if it helps."
