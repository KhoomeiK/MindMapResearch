depression,ff5dgrc,t3_erb1v7,1579588298.0,"Here in the same position. 20, turning 21, just now leaving unemployment because I'm too scared to commit to a job I might get burnt out in, I guess we'll see if Starbucks is enough to make me feel productive. My only real goals are getting my own place, getting my medical marijuana card and trying to stay afloat. Sometimes I think about the really cool comic book scenes and characters and stories I used to obsess over but I can't commit to bringing them to life in a way that will let others enjoy them as well. Same thing with music, I have ideas but I just don't have the patience. Sucks man. Feels like all I do is sleep, watch anime, and play Tekken. God forbid I lose a few ranked matches, I'll start questioning if I'm good at anything at all. Sometimes I just wish I could see the future, see if this is gonna work out or if I should quit while I'm ahead. It feels like I'm only fuelled by curiosity and boredom. You're not alone. Life's gotta be going somewhere interesting, I guess"

depression,fd74vrx,t3_ejw74l,1578199466.0,"Its weird. The structure in our tutorial phase of life is over, and its like nothing is going anywhere anymore. But that's only one side of the coin. The other side? You're free. I don't know how much you moved around during school or what all you got to see, but we're adults now, we just got here. There's a whole world out there to see. People we don't get to meet in school, amazing sights we didn't have the agency to find at our young age, beautiful relationships we wouldn't have been mature enough to handle in our youth. Things are just getting started. Practice is over, but I promise you friend, your life is not. What we have now is adventure, and that will last as long as we do"
Tekken,fd72x6t,t1_fd454c3,1578198765.0,Its awesome to hear that you and your husband can enjoy the game together. My parents went on their first dates to the arcade to play street fighter. Its a wonderful way for people to come together

depression,fcul6f6,t1_fcukh2y,1577983432.0,"Thanks for sharing more, I understand how you feel. Its really cliche but the right person will latch on to you when you're being your truest self and you won't feel the pressure to stay funny or interesting. I know it isn't the most reassuring thing in the world right now but she also has a responsibility for her own happiness, I'm sure she doesn't have bad intentions for you or want to hurt you personally. We all know how hard and confusing the road to personal happiness is. Also, on the bright side, you found someone who likes you for you! It happened, it will ABSOLUTELY happen again, and it'll keep happening until you're surrounded with people who love and care about you. Be more patient with yourself my man, I know it sucks right now but its a process, and I'm proud of you for coming to a place where people can listen and help instead of suffering in silence. Things will get better for you, they'll get better for all of us"
depression,fcuj5s1,t3_eilyoo,1577982192.0,"Its hard sometimes. My girlfriend ghosted me really hard for a few months when we were just close friend before we started dating and I didn't know why. It was during a time when I really needed her too, but she was confused and sad and didn't feel like she was good enough to be forgiven after she took a few weeks to focus on herself. I had a hard time thinking it wasn't because she didn't like me but it was quite the contrary. The post-depressive-episode apology tour is a bitch but I think that you can prevent it by just trying to be candid about yourself to your loved ones. Even if you're just confused and don't know why you want to be alone, you're allowed to say so. I'm sure someone will be there for you to word vomit to, and with enough reassurance that you shouldn't feel guilty for how you feel I'm sure the times you want to dissociate won't be so crippling :)"
depression,fcuib7o,t3_eixoet,1577981631.0,"Dreams can really kick your ass sometimes man I feel you there. A lot of times we can look back and be glad we didn't get what we thought we wanted, there's a good chance this is one of those times. You might meet another girl who's nothing like what you thought was your type but she'll turn out to be perfectly complimentary to you. You might make a really good friend who makes you feel like you can do anything and be the best person you can be. Don't give up hope on the waking world just yet"
depression,fcuhw30,t1_fctoy48,1577981345.0,"My answer; If it does, it does. I always try to think about Spike from Cowboy Bebop when he says ""Oh well, whatever happens, happens"" I'm gonna try to make the most out of my story, even if it is headed off a cliff"
depression,fcuhphw,t3_eit53m,1577981223.0,"Sometimes I have similar thoughts, where my good days only feel like good days if I think they can be a new beginning in life. I don't know if thats good or bad, but I understand. You don't need to start over or be somebody else, you can keep pressing on from where you're at and hopefully it won't take long to realize you already have everything you need :)"
Tekken,fcufpnk,t1_fcud65x,1577979857.0,"Believe it or not man not everyone only wants to get laid. In fact I will check r/depression and try to be there for some people because I think its the right thing to do since the topic is so heavy on my mind. I invite everyone who feels they have a bit of spare time and kind words to say to do so. I only learned about Aika after hearing about her surgery. However I was a fan of Etika before his passing and am really upset the world couldn't do better for him. It shouldn't be so impossible to you guys to think that somebody might actually feel sympathy for people in these dark places and want to help them for them, and not for some kind of reward. Obviously she has a hefty amount of orbiters and social rejects trying to rescue her just for her attention because she is a woman and has a cute anime pfp but that doesn't mean she doesn't deserve real emotional support, or that people should be discouraging others from trying to help. The last thing somebody with suicide on their mind wants to read is somebody implying that other people are more deserving of the support and effort that they also need. I don't know why you guys are so shocked by the idea of people doing things for reasons that don't involve being rewarded with sex but it makes you look just like the obnoxious white Knights everyone is so sick of, the only difference being that you're on strike.

Edit: Its asinine that you see people trying to help someone, and in response you feel the desire to virtue signal at everybody you can to guilt trip them into putting their attention on things YOU think they should focus on instead. You're creating a weird false dichotomy that calls out people that want to help Aika for not also helping every other person on earth with depression at the same time. Its childish and you need a snickers"
Tekken,fcu7ylr,t1_fcu3byb,1577974701.0,"This isn't always true. We're her community, we can't just sit and watch her fade away whether she can ever even play the game again or not. I'm an attempt survivor myself and when you get this desperate, sometimes the tear filled pleas of your closest loved ones won't penetrate but a cute dog on your walk home might be enough to make you realize your world isn't ending yet. We can tell her our favorite videos of hers, reach out with our stories of recovery to give her hope, suggest she try therapy or treatment, anything can help. Her world is crashing down and she feels like she can't hold it up any more, nobody deserves to feel that way ever. Whether what we do is of any consequence or not is up to fate but I'll be damned if I let desperate times scare me out of desperate measures"
