OkCupid,ferkr72,t1_feo56eu,1579355168.0,Funny thing that you do well on dates. Looks like you'll have better luck next time. Or the next next time. Meanwhile dudes like me don't need to stick their dicks in crazy so I wouldn't settle for less. In the end I thank white knights like you for catching all the crazy cunts like they were pokemons. You actually made the difference. Well done my friend.
OkCupid,femu4rl,t3_epw4yi,1579269656.0,"Had 4 dates. The first one turned in a fwb situation. It was OK. Sex was great but it fizzled out in the end.
The second one was a complete failure from the beginning. A fat jew girl with daddy issues. There was no second date with this chick. The third one was magical at first. We moved in together, sex was awesome, met her parents, she met mine. I also ignored a lot of redflags. She turned out to be a hardcore feminist and I was not OK with that nonsense so it ended badly for both of us. The fourth was a fat black chick that was whatever-sexual. Pan or bi or some other form of made up bullshit. Obviously there was no second date with that one either. So I gave up on online dating a while back because of too much crazies. I didn't want that so I improved my social skills and I have a normal girl that is not extreme in any way. I like that."
