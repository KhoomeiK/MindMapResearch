 I know that back in the beginning I would ignore it from him too. I was wrong to do that. Now I am the one who want to talk and he ignores. It's all fucked. 
I just wanted to get back to the days where him and I could be completely happy again and leave all that past shit in the past. But I was really hurt by a few things and I needed him to support me while trying to leave it in the past. But why couldn't he do that for me. Maybe he just didn't want too, or didn't know how. I would have done it for him and I have at times. I feel bad for the hurtful things I have said to him. I do. I never want to hurt him. But he would say sorry and then do the same stuff and then the next sorry had no substance to it. Because their was no effort of trying to be better and mindful of the issue before. Ugh I can't talk about this anymore. 

I thank you very very much for listening and being so nice."

I wish I could hug u right now. I would let you cry it out with no hesitation. I have done it over and over and I have no one ...and now he is gone and I really have no one.

Stay strong. You will be okay. Days will pass and as much as it hurts, it doesn't hurt as much when they are around and u feel like they don't even like u anymore. 

Try to doing things that make you smile. I paint. Or garden. I have focused on lots of things. I am so heartbroken that I feel I will never really let it go. But I am going to try my very best. He is fine living his wonderful life. He is a jerk. 

We deserve better and it took me a long long long time to see it. But the words he said to me .....mmm...no...not right to say to someone you love so much. He could ruthless and cold and flat out asshole. Right then I thought what the fuck am I doing to myself. Why would I keep letting him treat me like this and then him say that he does nothing wrong and I'm nuts. Lmao or excuse me...his word.... pathetic. 

Fuck that! Fuck him! Stay strong!!!"
AskReddit,ffpydn2,t1_ffpy5rh,1580110833.0,Yeah get really annoying and makes u feel like they don't care enough for you to start a conversation or even the thought of u so they pick up the phone. I know the feel well
BreakUps,ffpxl8g,t3_euebgz,1580109812.0,"I wouldn't. Just let it go. Don't try if your feelings are already gone. 

Been there done that and he feelings were gone and it fucked me up and he stung me along. I know he didn't care as much and didn't put any real effort to make the relationship strong again. He did some fucked up things that he doesn't even see because he chooses not too. Which made me on edge and sad and I cry all the time because I can't believe this person that I love and says they love me is acting like this towards me. 

We just ended hrs ago. He called me pathetic. I was blow away on how you said that to me. Right there was it. I couldn't take it anymore and I do not deserve to be treated like that after all my efforts on try to become a better couple, better me and better communicator. He resisted everything. I was the fool but no longer. I do not like who he is now. I don't understand and now I just don't care. I'm done hurting and I am done trying for someone who doesn't even talk to me, like me. Anything and everything. Yeah sex was good but it has been different for awhile. 

In the end ....don't go back. Stay true to yourself. Make sure u feel happy ."

BreakUps,ffpdav5,t3_euh8dg,1580092181.0,"Everything I do now is better after we broke up. 

I have one less person to make me feel like shit. I will miss him but I'll miss when he was nice to me not who he is now. The person he is now I do not like. He is cocky and rude and has no empathy for someone else or at least not for me. He acts fake. He talks about himself a lot. He has no feelings he is cold as fuck. He has no feelings for me. Strung me along. I will not be the fool any longer. I deserve someone who will be kind to me and be there when I am asking him to be there for me. He ignored me constantly. Fucking rude. He thinks he has done nothing wrong so then never practiced anything to make us stronger which then just told me he didn't give a shit. So why should I. I want someone who wants me and likes me for me. He didn't even like me lol. Fuck him."

And I do know he does love me but I just don't know what happened to where I know nothing about him anymore. And why is it that he seems to not really care that I am sad or wants to help me feel better about us. He ignores everything about us. Ugh...I'm so sick of thinking about it and talking about it.

love,ffit6ea,t3_e266vk,1579982093.0,"Lmao omg this I am sure of that the people closest to me would say...yep that you. Lmao shoot. 

I am a good person with a huge loving heart. The people closest to me have made some huge scares on me and yes I am angry. Damn right I am. But I don't want to be. So I am doing things to calm that part now. I wish that didn't know I was angry and hurt, so they wouldn't do things that they know I will get upset at and push me to get there just so they can turn around and tell me that I am crazy and awful so they can feel better about about themselves and not have to be accountable for how they actually treat me. If I have to learn to be better then I think it's only fair that maybe they should look within and see that they maybe could work on things themselves. 

If I was to get rid of every toxic person in my life.. .I wouldn't have anyone. I really don't have anyone persay now but meaning if I didn't talk to them anymore and never say them again. Then I would not a one single person left. Now that is fucking shitty. I love them all but they do not know the damage they have done to me over time and I just stay quiet and try not to breath when I am taking up their space lol"

Playing in the dirt in the backyard lol. I love to garden. I love plants so it always makes me happy to take care of my garden in spring and summer. 

I paint. Now I don't think I am amazing at it and I know other who think my stuff isn't all wonderful but I don't paint for them. I paint for myself. Makes me happy and helps me with my anger issues and helps me stay centered.

Cleaning the house lmao.
I love to clean. It makes me happy to see everything nice and neat and everything smells good and things are shiny and dust free. Lol I sit on the couch after and enjoy the being in my clean surroundings lol I'm a freak I know.
