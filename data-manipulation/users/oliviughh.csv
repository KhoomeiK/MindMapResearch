birthcontrol,ffubosj,t3_ev7zo8,1580238600.0,I experienced worsened periods whenever I took a pill that had any estrogen in it (because estrogen causes endometriosis to flare up and worsen). Google the name of your pill + side effects if you want to see what’s considered a normal side effect.

If you do have endometriosis, taking birth control that does NOT contain estrogen is your best bet. Estrogen leads to the endometrium growing."
