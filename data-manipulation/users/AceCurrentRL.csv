My bad, testosterone does play a role in repairing muscle tissue.

The10thDentist,fe9rd6y,t3_eo6l9y,1578940840.0,"Death from being strangled by a nerd's thighs is hot as fuck.

Okay, allow me to explain myself. I've always found stereotypical nerdy men hot. Horn rimmed glasses, bowties, suspenders just make me feel plain giddy. The Warden of Superjail is my husbando and I don't care, I LOVE that nerdy fucker. 

Anywho, allow me to get to my point. When I was younger I came across a forum for people who shared weird ways people have died. One of them was a woman who shared a story about how she heard about a nerd who strangled a guy who was harassing him to death with his thighs.

I became fixated. I had to find more cases and I did. I found 4 more in total including one on my Discord (he confessed to accidentally killing his boyfriend this way) that happened in 2017. My personal favorite is one that happened in 2014 in a small Oregon town. An 18 year old was found strangled in his car, and he was last seen alive with three stereotypical looking nerdy guys. The bruising on his neck made the coroner conclude that he'd been strangled between ''a set of thighs''. 

I don't know 100% why but ever since I get turned on whenever I look at a nerdy man's pale inexplicably bald feta cheese looking thighs. I imagine them tightening around my neck and slowly cutting off my air supply like a boa constrictor. I want to be submissive to a nerd and I am jealous of people who have been strangled by nerd thighs."
