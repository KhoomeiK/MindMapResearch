People like Bernie because he isn't a Neolib. Like I said he is a democratic socialist. He is the only candidate that is for MFA. It's not gatekeeping, it's a sold argument because Bernie is the most progressive candidate in the race. 

It makes me crack up laughing when you say warren and Harris are more progressive when none of them are for MFA. Warren back-stepped away from supporting MFA.

Warren definitely isn't a strait up centrist but she continues to show that she is nowhere near as progressive as Bernie Sanders. 

Here are some articles about how her plan isn't actually Medicare for all (it's Medicare for all who want it). Her plan will just make Dems look bad like Obama care did. It's a step in the right direction, but with Sanders in the race it's a step backwards at this point.

When she plans to enact M4A it will actually be M4A for those who want it. That will kill the possibility of M4A being a successful change. By making it optional you make it so those who are high risk individuals will gravitate twords M4A(who want it) and those who arn't will stay with what they already have.

worldpolitics,fdw6hne,t1_fdvz5x3,1578755542.0,"Yes, in a better country ran by people who actually represent the country as a whole, unions would not be necessary. You're right. 
Union members are not lazy though, they are forced to unionize to protect their livelyhood. Because our system is so dependant on profits for a company to be deemed accessable they are always trying to increase profits. How do they do that? By lowering wages, overworking their laborers and decreasing the overall value of the job. That's why companies move overseas, because it's cheaper labor therefore larger profit margins. 
I agree that things need to be changed so we dont need to unionize to be treated properly by our employers. 
We don't use a pure capitalist system in America and we need to be moving away from that model, not imaging closer as we are now. The age of automation and AI is coming and when most jobs can be filled by robots we are in for a rude awakening, we need to be thinking ahead.

They as a group then discuss this issue with their employer and the two sides find a way to come to an agreement. Obviously it's a lil more complicated than that but that's the simple version.

Employers have all the power. By creating unions, workers balance out the scales a bit more.

More often than not it's employers that use shady (& illegal) tactics to discourage unions. Some companies will lay off large groups of people the second they hear whispers of unionizing because they know that means better pay for the people which hurts their precious profits. That is illegal but some companies will still do it.

So capitalism does only one thing: encourage profits.
So this ensures that every business is constantly chasing higher profits. Companies in our time own the means of production, given them full control of the capitalist system.

Mean of production are as follows: Land, Labor, Capital, Entrepreneurship.
The easiest for companies to control is labor and capital. As they set these prices on their own. If they cant increase their prices (capital) then guess what they do? They decrease the value of the labor required to create their capital, aka they lower wages for workers. 

In a pure capitalistic society companies would be allowed to sell goods for whatever they want and pay their workers whatever they want. And their only goal would be to increase profits. That leads to capitalism encouraging the abuse workers to increase profits. 

Unions give some control to the labor force, thus preventing companies from bleeding their labor force dry to maximize profits. So unless you want an even greater rift of inequality than there is already in this country, it's in everyone's best interests to keep unions alive and strong. 

The rich want you to think unions are bad so you can help them fight for higher profits (which the labor force will get none of)."
