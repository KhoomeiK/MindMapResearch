Any time our band was on a bus the back of the bus was a big NSFW area. Alcohol, sex, BJs, titties, pot brownies.

I played several instruments for the concert, marching, and jazz bands so I was there for a good bit of it. The exact opposite situation occurred with the school choir folks. I played bass guitar for the jazz and show choirs as well. I don't know what the deal with the choir parents were but they were super over protective. We'd get to a competition and the choir parents would make them get into their outfits and go sit in a quiet room, usually on the floor, two hours before a performance. This included high school seniors. I guess either I'm fortunate or they were that the choir directors treated the band kids differently. For the jazz choir it was just me and then older adults that were hired in for the drums and piano. Those two guys were typical professional musicians. They were basically perverts. So I hung out with them smoking cigarettes and listening to their nasty stories. For the show choir, which had a full jazz ensemble backing it up, the choir director would just look at us and say ""Be on stage ready at 2:00."" And then we'd go do band kid stuff like drinking, smoking, and sex, until it was time to play."

I've known of some of these people since the 90's or maybe even the 80's. One lady was on local tv forever before moving to radio. Two of the ladies who are in the news department and have a two hour show each day have been doing radio news in the market since the 90's. And the mid day guy used to be the classic rock station morning guy. I met him when I was in high school about 1994 or so.

They do talk politics. But they talk about all sorts of other stuff. The mid day guy is always talking about barbeque and smoking meats and things like that he does. He's always talking about his recipes. He's happy to take up an hour with people calling in talking about barbeque recipes. He also has something called The Big Stupid Question of the Day. He asks it at the beginning of the show and you can call in with answers all through his show. Sometimes people will be calling into the next guy's show talking about it if it's a hot topic. It might be like ""What's the best movie you've seen?"" Or ""Worst?"" Or best band, best rock song. It could be anything and it's just entertaining and people call in about it.

It appears as though McDonald's only limited his public appearances in 2016 when everyone was running around in clown costumes trying to scare people.

I find this website and its sister YouTube channels to be well researched. They have a write up on Ronald from 2018 that says he's very much still active.

There's almost 22,000 comments in this thread. I can't fact check them all. But plenty of people are fact checking you. I'm sure you're arguing with them as well. Instead, spend time googling your ""facts"" and see for yourself where you are wrong. You might learn something."

But not just in regards to this post. So much of what we read on the internet is inaccurate or flat out false. It is so important to fact check everything you read and not believe it on it's face value. This is especially true with political quotes and memes that get passed around. They are usually, at best, half truths. That's not picking on one side or the other, it's everyone that does it. So doing your own independent research is so important you so you can be informed."
