Maybe your body is saying a job that requires sitting almost all day is not the best job for you.

Although maybe stretching multiple times a day rather than just in the morning, like when you start feeling it stop and get up and walk around and stretch it out. Hopefully it gets better in time!

For example my company wants the truck back at the main terminal and lays out a cost list for if you leave it at one of the other terminals and a formula to figure cost if you leave the truck somewhere else. A previous company's policy was so long as it was on company property then it wasn't truck abandonment.

Take some hometime, clean out your truck and only leave the bare essentials, then get back to home terminal (or another company approved location to leave the truck) and hand in your keys.

Companies have been known to get petty and fire you almost instantly upon receiving your notice so beware that if you do give notice you may suddenly find yourself god knows how far from home with a truck full of stuff to get home."
Truckers,fctljte,t1_fctexdd,1577947792.0,I agree with what he said and yes I am speaking from personal experience. I had multiple gaps in my work history and I simply said I was unemployed. I also know that if a company doesn't confirm past employment with them that you can use pay stubs/W2 to prove employment.

Truckers,fctdzlg,t1_fctb0n0,1577940245.0,Yup! From personal experience I wouldn't say it's as bad as having a van behind you but you definitely still get pushed around if the wind is bad enough.

Truckers,fcsxllw,t1_fcsrcrt,1577927664.0,"I'm not misunderstanding anything. How the rule is stated is a big factor. ""No tolerance to cell phone use while driving"" is a BIG difference to ""no tolerance to cell phone in hand while driving"". OP wasn't using the phone, just moving it therefore should not fall under the use rule but would fall under the in hand rule.

You of course also have the umbrella rule of simply no phone which could apply to to even using a headset to talk on the phone while driving. Without specifications you don't know what falls under that rule.

My scenario is not saying there should be tolerance but stating that sometimes things get stuck under the umbrella of a rule despite not belonging under that umbrella. Moving a phone is NOT the same thing as using a phone."

On the flip side, I injured my wrist about a year ago and never had any bruising but there tenderness when touched that would come a go, sharp pain when using it that would come and to, and a deep ache that would come and go. Finally got it looked at and an MRI done and turns out I tore the tendon sheath. Could take up to 2 years to fully heal.

Definitely go to a doctor if you think there is something serious going on."
Truckers,fcsuf7b,t1_fcr64qn,1577925377.0,Also look at cost of living for the area you are thinking of moving too. Making more money does you no good if that extra you make now has to go to your cost of living.

Truckers,fcsmma9,t1_fcrjkl4,1577919788.0,Guess I've never ran across a no tolerance rule I've disagreed with or found silly. I've seen several situations that shouldn't have fallen under some of those no tolerance rules (like the one OP stated) but the no tolerance rule itself comes from an understandable place.
