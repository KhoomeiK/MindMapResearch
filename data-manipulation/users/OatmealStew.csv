news,fdnbfmt,t1_fdn85dp,1578582153.0,There was actually a front page headline yesterday explaining how they actually do control that much digital advertising. The number 20% wasn't used. But check out the thing about college humor laying off all of its staff except for 10 people. The second top comment breaks it down there.
news,fdm0pcy,t1_fdl5mf8,1578537037.0,So this is the how the road to an actual orwellian big brother is paved in detail. And its all just kind of naturally happening. All of this follows suit with America's economic model mixed with a new industry (the internet) and it's peculiarities.
todayilearned,fdjtqxr,t3_ellgp2,1578487188.0,The ole control of any semblance of self autonomy tactic. When are schools going to stop feeling like they need to produce worker bees?
LifeProTips,fdjslgo,t1_fdjquza,1578486000.0,That's right on par with every story I've heard about the guy well before the disappearences. It's amazing someone can manage to be an incessant colossal piece of shit for decades. At least he got what he deserves at some point rather than getting away with it his whole life.
LifeProTips,fdjqp5q,t1_fdjax0v,1578483814.0,Before both of those things. People genuinely did not like him before all the events.

worldnews,fdiy0mi,t3_eljp1u,1578453630.0,"So...
1) US embassy is ""attacked"". (Aka giant compund full of Marines). No casualties. 
2) In response, US drone strikes most important Iranian military figure at a PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.
3) Iran, with a competent and capable military, attacks a base in Iraq essentially so they don't look weak on the world stage, but with no US casualties. (Which seems extremely intentional). 
4) Iran claims it will level Dubai if the US retaliates. 

Trump immensely over reacted in step 2. Why wouldn't he after step 3? This seriously smells like WW3. What would HAVE to happen after something like Dubai being destroyed?"

OldSchoolCool,fczfawn,t3_ejmsb7,1578099980.0,I'm a radio tech in the military. I sometimes think about what my job would be like during WW2 and it seems like a made-up movie that anything even remotely associated to my life could be anything similar to manning an HF radio in a trench.

AskReddit,fcxmm6u,t1_fcx22p3,1578066565.0,"I've never read the book, so I'm just playing devil's advocate here. Is it possible that you identify with the narrator and you're have a lack in scope of perspective leads you to believe everyone must identify with them as well? Or is it possible that you don't like the ways in which you identify with them and it makes you wish or hope everyone else does too?"
