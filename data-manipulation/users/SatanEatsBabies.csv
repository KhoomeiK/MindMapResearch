NoStupidQuestions,ffanr6c,t1_ffan4kd,1579740271.0,This is a good explanation. I have a mark on my face. Parents are always horrified when the kids ask but I just matter of fact say it’s a birth mark. Some kids are ok with just that and some want more explanation so I like this puppy spot idea. Most don’t even say anything.

labrador,ffa7ukv,t1_ff9nzmv,1579729580.0,Mine hates water. Baths are the worst. Took her to the lake and tried to get her in. It was so hot and she’s black she had to be so hot but she wouldn’t go in past her ankles. Even then it was only for a few minutes. I’ve always thought something bad must have happened to her before we adopted her.

changemyview,ff2wjlt,t3_ercjll,1579526828.0,Have you ever noticed how when something bad happens to him he does something even dumber and then everyone forgets about the first thing? I think he does that on purpose. He’s good at changing the narrative and the media falls for it every time. I don’t think he’s completely dumb as many on the left do because he was smart enough to get elected. I however don’t think he has a grand plan. I think he’s just flying by the seat of his pants. He knows how to manipulate people and the media but when it comes to actual policy he just goes with whatever the person in front of him says.

NoStupidQuestions,fcyodgt,t3_ejkxzk,1578083833.0,"I lived in an apartment and when it would rain a lot it got a weird smell. Not like mold but in this case cat lee. You couldn’t smell anything any other times. Has it been raining a lot there? But mold could indicate moisture. When you wipe down the walls i would use a diluted bleach solution. You could also try something like this.

offmychest,fcyo12p,t3_ejky0j,1578083645.0,Hormones can do this to people. Sounds like you’ve let it become a bad habit though. Try focusing your attention other places. Not easy but try one step at a time. Force yourself to go to the gym and tire yourself out. I would think that would would help. Make yourself go places so you can’t masturbate. I’m assuming you don’t do it in public. Allow yourself to still do it at certain times cause going cold turkey can be too hard.
unpopularopinion,fcynng7,t3_ejky0s,1578083433.0,What about characters that are actually good. Not like Disney princesses but like someone who does positive things that you would want your kids to look up to. For example a character that goes through a rough time but turns things around and makes a better life? Like what about Pinocchio? He gets in all sorts of trouble and turns his shit around.

AmItheAsshole,fcxh7oe,t3_ej8u10,1578062851.0,My MIL had cancer and didn’t tell anyone. So when she died it cane as a total shock. The family had just been to visit her two weeks earlier and she said nothing about it. So when she died it was extremely traumatic. My partner had a really hard time dealing with it. Ended up in antidepressants. Seeing how it affected others I think it was a terrible selfish thing for her to do to her family.
PsychWardChronicles,fcx801t,t3_ej7f59,1578054892.0,The last one I was in still gives me nightmares. And it’s been 8 years I think. It was a shit hospital though. It was like being in prison. Then they over loaded the unit. So one toilet for about 30 people. They never came and cleaned anything on the unit the whole time I was there. It just got grosser and grosser by the day. The tv was on the news constantly. Very stressful. Then ( I was there for attempted suicide) all of the group sessions started to be about addiction and how great 12 step programs are. Didn’t help me at all.

That’s what family does they take care of each other. That’s pretty selfish of you to expect to be paid especially a crazy amount. I would never charge my family to babysit for a few days.
