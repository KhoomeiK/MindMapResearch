Showerthoughts,ffje0r9,t1_ffj9cva,1579996284.0,"We also probably shouldn’t be teaching children that violence is non-existent. There’s virtually no  evidence that learning about or watching violence at a young age actually illicits any abnormal reaction then or later. Also, people can experience/watch violence without it being “a good thing”."

A clean cut to the neck makes them feel no pain at all, because you’re literally severing the nerves that let them feel pain. And it does that instantaneously."
FiftyFifty,ffhfn39,t1_ffhfcke,1579933232.0,"Where I come from, numerous volts of electricity coursing though your body for a few seconds is far more painful and prolonged than instant severance of the spinal cord. But what do I know."
PublicFreakout,ffhf9nf,t3_etmivg,1579932796.0,"Not in public. Not a freak out.

Fuck off, OP.

rva,ffdbic9,t1_ffdal82,1579817323.0,"Agree, but I think more tired of hearing about how the purported and spun skinhead, Neo-Nazi, far-right, KKK, Confederate sympathizer rally that never really became a skinhead, Neo-Nazi, far-right, KKK, Confederate sympathizer rally is now somehow still a skinhead, Neo-Nazi, far-right, KKK, Confederate sympathizer rally. The assessment was wrong and still is. Let's move on."
