My e30 on the New England mountain roads is unparalleled in driving experience. It’s so nimble and can turn on a dime :)

I absolutely love the older 5 series; does yours have a tape deck hidden behind faux wood trim? That shit is absolutely hilarious to me."
BMW,fdrjnh2,t1_fdrhy5o,1578685460.0,Aw I love it! I appreciate newer BMWs but the older ones just have that lil extra something about them that wins me over every time.
BMW,fdrfpe7,t3_emtpde,1578683889.0,"I have an e30 and an e90 and you get one guess which one I’m being buried in because I’m not selling it, ever."
todayilearned,fdraivi,t1_fdr9c6e,1578681694.0,"Yes exactly! Interestingly enough, in my profession we sometimes use isopropyl alcohol flushed through a lumen to facilitate a faster dry time. It’s fascinating to me that it’s used to achieve two different goals in both scenarios."
todayilearned,fdr4ijy,t1_fdqzdcp,1578679347.0,"An open flame would definitely be enough to kill most bad stuff, but even combined with alcohol you’re achieving the same amount of disinfection. 

If the dwell time (how long the alcohol has to be “wet” on the surface) is met, your level of disinfection would be more or less the same as using alcohol first then burning. To boot, depending on the flame source...you could actually be contaminating it more than if you just used alcohol. 

Thank you for engaging my brain, this was fun :)"
todayilearned,fdqxan9,t1_fdqqj54,1578676100.0,"Neither 70% nor 91% alcohol will sterilize anything. It is a disinfectant, meaning it can remove the bulk of infectious material.

A sterilant is something that would render an item sterile, meaning that ALL bacterial/infectious agents are rendered inactive (except CJD, shitty prion). You will never achieve sterilization from drinking any amount of alcohol, just organ failure.

Seems pedantic but I’m a sterile processing technician and the distinction is critically important for patient safety."
todayilearned,fdqw6fz,t1_fdqpgpj,1578675664.0,"Thank you for noting that alcohol (cognac or isopropyl!) is not a sterilant! I’m a sterile processing technician and it seems pedantic but disinfection and sterility are not the same and it’s kind of important to know the difference. 

That said, I absolutely understand this was an emergency but even the article uses the wrong words :("
notliketheothergirls,fdoyj71,t1_fdosxun,1578615802.0,"you’re absolutely right! Over a decade later, it’s clear that their shift in branding was a success."
