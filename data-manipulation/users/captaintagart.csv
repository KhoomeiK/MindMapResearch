Diablo3DemonHunters,ffj9401,t1_ffh6mih,1579993352.0,"Oh shiz, the season journey looks like a lot. Not sure I’ll have time to get my seasonal dh ready for some of those quests in time. She just hit 40. I think the season is over tomorrow?"
Diablo3DemonHunters,ffj8qyw,t1_ffihow2,1579993126.0,"Thank you for your thorough answer. I made a seasonal character a few weeks ago just to get butcher pet and the red soul gem, so I picked her back up today and just finished act 1 of story. When does this season end? Any day now, yeah?"

diablo3,ffcuh1l,t1_ffbu1y3,1579807504.0,"I started playing early this month and my main character is a demon hunter (hit paragon 93 last night). I keep inching up difficulty but she seems to shred through everything. I want to try higher gr but I ran out of keys and the key bosses drop these machine parts. I have all 3 and don’t know where to use them.

But is DH supposed to be OP, or am I just not used to the difficulty scales in this game? I usually play games on normal and never find myself clamoring for more challenge"
diablo3,ffctx3m,t3_esw22m,1579807182.0,"I always hear that element stats don’t really mean anything, but I presume Magefist boosts the skills that do fire damage, like twin chakrams. I have it in the cube and one on me in case I wanna swap em out. Am I on the right track? Or should I ignore element skill boosts too?"
