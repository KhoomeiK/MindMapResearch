I thought it was very clever actually - she was 18 months not 18 years after all - and because it was such an accurate imitation it meant that she could communicate very clearly no matter which language was being spoken. 

I’m glad that speech therapists agree that these are words. She was definitely using them to communicate and it was a clever solution to a complex linguistic situation. 

Even as a teenager she will sometimes use a very accurate sound affect along with gestures if she has forgotten the word for something - like yesterday when her brain was reaching for the word “Soda stream machine”"
