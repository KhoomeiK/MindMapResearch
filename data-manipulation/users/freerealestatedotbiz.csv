television,fff5ycl,t1_fff1fb1,1579876554.0,"Solo flopped because (1) Lucasfilm bended to early negative press and tried to bury it with minimal promotion and the strange decision to move the release from the typical holiday slot, which signaled to most people they thought it was bad (and it put it in competition with much bigger, more anticipated movies); (2) people are tired of seeing stuff that'$ just a montage of call-backs and shamelessly trying to capitalize on nostalgia; and (3) Harrison Ford is so intrinsic and indelible to the Han Solo character, asking audiences to care about anyone else in the role is really difficult.

With that said, it was still pretty good and imo WOM could have salvaged it  if Lucasfilm didn't treat it like their unwanted stepchild."
television,ffcpdfd,t1_ffboalj,1579804370.0,"If they're not going to allow testimony or the presentation of other evidence, why would I watch? It's going to be a sham trial with a vote exactly down the aisle. In other words, it's a foregone conclusion of no consequence. Without evidence, it's just an act of political theater (on both sides) that most people will probably have forgotten about by the time the general election rolls around.

Do I think the evidence would show that he should be impeached? Yes. But watching this won't give me or anyone else any information to think otherwise than I or they do right now."

Overwatch,ff45zp5,t1_ff3j9v8,1579556291.0,"Also is it just me or is the community just better in mystery heroes? And not just from a toxicity standpoint. I feel like for the most part people in those games are much more focused on the objective because they're not so caught up in getting POG with their mains or trying to 1v1 each other to show off. Like because it's all random, the only thing for you to really do is play the point. Obviously, not always true, but I am having much more fun in this mode than I did in old QP or role queue."

LateStageCapitalism,fewele4,t1_feuyohl,1579409298.0,"It also says encourages people to invest resources into making the exaxt same thing and then competing on brand image. Like there is no difference in the QOL between the flagship smartphones. Imagine if the top people from Apple, Google, and Samsung were all working together to make the best, most useful phone. Instead we pay a premium on the phones to subsidize ad campaigns and create the illusion of ""competition"" between three companies  hawking the same product"

Plus you don't have to follow every step. I personally had never thought to try French onion pasta, but it sounds pretty good. I would probably change a couple things, but imo the point of the sub is to find out about easy, quick recipes or at least inspiration for something similar."

StarWars,fe4rc0w,t1_fe4ftb3,1578862058.0,"From what I understand, for George that means examining the microbes that he says are responsible for the force. I don't really see how three movies putting force-wielding bacteria under a microscope would be engaging at all. For me, I don't really need a scientific explanation of what the force is because I find the interesting things about are its spiritual aspects and the philosophical ideas that different force-users have come up with after tapping into it"

StarWars,fe4b277,t1_fe3zzlj,1578857445.0,"It was honestly set up perfectly to have Rey break bad in the third movie  (even without shoehorning Palpatine lineage in there), and then have Kylo/Ben ""rise"" back to the light and either redeem her or defeat her. I don't think they needed a ""big bad"" because the dynamic between those two characters was so compelling. It would have worked as the central conflict supporting the story without the need for a galaxy-ending threat.

It's weird that Disney of all companies didn't get this because they've built an empire off of more focused, character-driven stories."
