Luigi will message you, saying that he needs help in battlerock galaxy (fountain). To save him, get to the end of the first star and blow up the cage he's in. He's on the bottom of the planet with the regular star. (Medium)

In dusty dunes (bedroom), feed the hungry Luna to reveal a new planet. Inside that planet, find the five silver stars to spawn the green star. (Easy, but can be time consuming.)
