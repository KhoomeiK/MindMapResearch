AskMen,ff3l1um,t3_ergqrn,1579543317.0,"People pass judgement and categorize others for shallow, stereotypical reasons. I'd avoid taking it to heart. Instead, focus on being a good person and proving them wrong.


That being said, the typical fuck boy that comes to most people's minds is a frat bro. They dress like they're either going to the gym OR they're about to spend the afternoon on their uncle's boat. The paisley shorts, the polos, the Sperry's top-siders, maybe a snapback hat."

dankmemes,ff1s03e,t1_ff0oqhk,1579484880.0,"Well it's actually more than that. The amount of blood, gore, violence, nudity, sex, narcotics use, etc are all key factors that determine a film's MPAA rating. You can find videos on YouTube that break down scenes in a movie's rating for the theatrical release vs the original unrated director's cut. The lines that separate PG-13 and R are so stupid and arbitrary. It's absurd how tame the pivotal factors can be. I'm not even talking about how explicit the dialogue is.


But yeah, nowadays our real world is obsessed with language and the use of certain words. ""Bad language"" has ended careers and ruined lives. If some people so much as *hear* obscenities or politically incorrect language then they come apart at the seams, have to run to therapy, make mountains out of molehills, and destroy that person's life."
Showerthoughts,fewb6v0,t1_fevr2tk,1579407843.0,"One of the toughest, but also weirdly liberating, things I've learned since leaving high school is how superficial and impermanent friendship can be. I do long for those bygone days but I also know how to let people go. I will always be their friend at heart but we're not going to talk or text or see each other or any of that. Friends come and go. It's bittersweet every time. But I value what we brought to each other's lives."
Jokes,fetwut1,t1_fet5r48,1579380865.0,"Here's the thing: we're so obsessed with being strong, secure, and away from any kind of harm (especially if it's a foreign threat) that we'll *allow* this kind of reactionary overreach. No politician has been voted out of office for supporting the Patriot Act. It may not be very popular or even constitutional, but the general public has made it abundantly clear that it's willing to tolerate those policies as a sort of means to an end. They barely see it, it doesn't tangibly effect them, and most people don't have anything to hide. It's a gross violation of American rights and it guts the Constitution... but unfortunately people just don't care. Never underestimate human paranoia and our primal desire for (perceived) safety. It's part of why the 2nd amendment is so fiercely defended: everyone wants to feel as though they're safe and protected against potential threats. The police state is just a large scale version of that concept.

If the only ones fighting against the Patriot Act are young people, hippies, conspiracy theorists, rednecks (at least when a *Democrat* is in office), and liberal political idealists then things won't change.

If any measures were removed from the Patriot Act, and some sort of terrorist attack happened afterwards, it'd only ensure the Patriot Act's survival."

AskMen,felrdbj,t1_feln1sj,1579229065.0,Yeah it's *really* hard to sustain a religious-atheist relationship because that kind of stuff is often deeply rooted. People who are religious (and it's important to them) generally won't stick around for someone who's a non-believer. The same goes for outspoken atheists. Both sides of the spectrum like to try to convert each other.

television,fekfj0s,t1_fejziu6,1579198974.0,"It's subjective, but for the most part yeah there's almost always serious damage in the wake of trauma. Trauma can harden people and it can break people. The hardened people are stronger and can handle themselves, but they've been emotionally and psychologically damaged. Trauma, not ""evil"" or sadism, is what turns normal people into bad people. And it can continue the cycle of one person spreading their trauma to the next person."
rimjob_steve,fekaydx,t1_fejnm41,1579196261.0,"I've thought about something like this recently. It'd be an interesting superpower to have. You could take away, and return, all of the memories a person has of you. Basically what Prof X did at the end of X-Men First Class. Everything in a person's memory is the same except you've been edited out.

I've screwed up, left bad/lackluster impressions, burned bridges, and broken hearts over the years. If I could snap my fingers and reset everything everyone, except my family, knows about me I'd be very tempted to do it. Wipe it clean and start over. I'd do/say the right things. But I could also return those old memories if I wanted to."
BlackPeopleTwitter,feiwev6,t1_feiqwao,1579149053.0,"Well yes and no. I'm from the south and I've certainly run into my share of good ol boys. Recruitment is easy when the sociocultural narrative began pushing concepts like ""white privilege"" and people kept saying ""straight white men are the cause of all problems!"" (I'm a liberal and white privilege is definitely real, but I'm just giving the overview of the situation from a more nuanced perspective). Actively shaming people who are white, and proud of where they came from, wasn't/isn't gonna win them over.

Here's the thing we have to remember: Charlottesville was a nationwide gathering of the alt right and associated groups. The call went out over a bunch of different platforms. It may not be a grand total, but it certainly puts the proportional numbers of radical white supremacists into perspective: there were ~250 people there that day.

Klan rallies and demonstrations in public have always existed. In a documentary I saw about the KKK about 15 years ago had unmasked interviews them. No shame or attempt to hide their identities. Then they went to a demonstration at one of the big city courthouses(?) and most all of them had their faces exposed. This was a joint rally with an Aryan brotherhood group as well.

Here's the thing: people think there are all of these neo-nazis everywhere, but the truth is the numbers of registered members of white supremacist organizations in the US are some of the lowest numbers on record. It's not getting bigger, nor are rallies all that different from what they were a few decades ago. People are pissed off and the media frenzy nowadays caters to the right and left side narratives of ""immigrants/neo-nazis are coming in droves (and you should be terrified)!"""
pics,fei4yvt,t1_fei1jqi,1579130392.0,"Yeah idk why the religious right uses *homosexuality* as it's punching bag. I'm forgetting the exact quote, but I believe the Bible says that if an unwed woman is raped then the rapist must pay/offer the father of the raped woman silver and some livestock (I'm forgetting the specifics) as compensation. The rapist is supposed to then marry her.


You know more about the Bible than me so you can probably clarify this.


There's some seriously fucked up shit that's just casually thrown in there. It's flabbergasting that the right still holds on to their *homophobia.*"
