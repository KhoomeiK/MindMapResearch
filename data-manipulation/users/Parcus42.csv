Mr Beast, it's ok,"

Trump shedding light on democrats profiting from office is an not an impeachable crime."

When the city people ignore the country people, the country people get pissed off and come and chop their heads off. It happened regularly throughout history."

 And if you don't believe it, who wants to abolish the electoral college?"

Maybe he doesn't feel particularly sorry for ""people of color"" because life sucks for white people too. Too much affirmative action just deepens the divisions. You can't cure racism with more racism. If your kids getting picked on, regardless of ethnicity, teach him to box."

worldnews,fgojx8v,t1_fgntwjp,1580972785.0,"Yes. And Bernie will struggle more with cognative dissonance of justifying his shallow morality compared to Trump's actual accomplishments and competence to really make people's lives better.

It's important for Trump to be challenged, and maybe he's achieved enough in one term to leave it here. I want to hear what he plans to do in his second term. And perhaps Bernie could compromise his socialism enough to do a good job. Either way, I trust the system. The people are rejecting the corrupt, weak and cynical grifters with no integrity."

They're much smarter than governments. 

Governments always make really bad decisions. About what technology will solve problems, how to manage people. 
It's not so much that billionaires deserve their money, it's that they'll use it better to get people the things they need. Like Bezos is such a bad guy, but Amazon is a great service!"
