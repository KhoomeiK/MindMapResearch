Everything is free when you're a kid since your parent buys everything. I figure the kid fixated on the name thing because she wanted to feel special for a day and that's why the mom wants E names to get chosen. Makes sense for a child to make a big deal out of it, not so much for a full grown adult."
AskReddit,ffseuj6,t3_eutai7,1580179993.0,"I got off too easy, still got A's even with losing or forgetting most of my homework, never learned solid work ethic, and dropped out of college after 1 semester (giving up some really nice a scholarships in the process). Fast forward to now, I'm age 27, spent a long time drifting rudderless, about to go back to school to learn a trade and get my life back on track. Also I still stick papers everywhere without a folder or binder soooo"

exjw,ffbwcol,t1_ffaz5zr,1579784940.0,It's even worse than a young adult woman having to answer these questions: she was an actual child. Sickening that the organization allows this kind of behavior.

exjw,ff3bilj,t1_ff2r526,1579537927.0,"This was my exact thought. When you encourage people to come write for you instead of getting an education, you end up with uneducated writers."
monkeyspaw,ff2yput,t1_ff2wp8t,1579528864.0,"You're just describing doing easy stuff quickly, I'm not trying to start a big reddit fight here, was just pointing out that you don't have to be ignorant of what food service is like to think it's an easy job."
monkeyspaw,ff2r373,t1_ff0fv8d,1579520284.0,"Lol I have and it is easy af... of course there are shitty customers sometimes but get real, there is nothing hard about pushing buttons on a screen and counting back change or assembling orders based on what another screen tells you"

Lore_Olympus,fey6zk0,t1_fevtx5e,1579441566.0,I don't understand why you keep reading this comic when you clearly don't enjoy it; every single comment I've seen of yours is negative and critical.

KingkillerChronicle,femvqdn,t1_femkwi6,1579270876.0,I like the translation explanation. Works perfectly without being a stretch.
menwritingwomen,fel0ll8,t1_feizgoi,1579211494.0,"I haven't read them since I was a young teen, but I would have sworn there was a whole sequence where she learned his language. I distinctly remember her having trouble with generalizations (the word ""rock"" referring to all rocks rather than each type having a different name) and blowing his mind with her perfect recollection. Then they go find the nearby settlement and it turns out he taught her his native language instead of the local language and she got pissed at him. I cannot be making up these memories? Unless I'm going insane lol"
