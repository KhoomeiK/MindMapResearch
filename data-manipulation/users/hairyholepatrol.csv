therewasanattempt,ffard18,t1_ffaq39x,1579742701.0,Lol at yelling at a Filipino for having an Hispanic name. Read a fucking book sometime you dolt!
television,ff9wak5,t1_ff9dcb3,1579722906.0,I imagine it’s tough to pull off. Don’t think many people could do that. I guess it helps that they knew each other so well. Graham probably would’ve found it hilarious if he could’ve seen it. And if it had been Cleese who died I’m sure Graham would’ve done something similar. It’s so funny and so touching at the same time. It’s just beautiful.

wholesomememes,ff4uc05,t1_ff4k8a5,1579572636.0,"I remember seeing him in Gladiator (awesome) and I think Signs. And then I don’t think I saw any of his movies for like a decade and then boom...The Master -blown away. Her - floored. Inherent Vice...etc etc. 

And I was like whoa I forgot the guy existed for a while (my own fault) and then thought holy shit every movie I’ve seen him in the past several years he’s just astounding."

wholesomememes,ff4s9gp,t1_ff4nqvu,1579571213.0,"Tom Hardy is great. 

You know, it’s funny to look at big name actors and then reflect on where you first saw them. I remember seeing Joaquin in Gladiator and Signs (he wasn’t really obscure then though). I remember vaguely seeing Hardy in Layer Cake. And then he exploded. Makes me wonder what other future great actors are lurking in bit parts."

freefolk,ff096x3,t1_feyzxh7,1579466559.0,I don’t even want to reread the books anymore. Actually I reread the first 3 late last year but I really had no desire to read feast or dance and probably will never read the new one if it ever comes out.
WTF,fez018b,t1_fexjpm9,1579452589.0,After the fact it’s a funny story but in the moment it can be kind of scary and tense. So I don’t really blame that reaction anymore than I blame someone for being mentally ill.
WTF,feyzoz4,t1_fexwgtt,1579452465.0,...courteously? That’s...an interesting interpretation.

trippinthroughtime,fenijak,t1_femzhqg,1579285438.0,"My point was just that that was a theory articulated independently of the bicameral mind theory. I mean, Jaynes didn’t invent the idea of hearing voices, or interior monologues, or intrusive thoughts or anything like that, he was theorizing on the development of consciousness. So my point was just that the idea that Abraham was hearing voices or had an intrusive thought is not really unique to Jaynes and doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with bicameralism. 

I’m not sure I’m phrasing this the way I want to."
television,femw91i,t1_fekxj89,1579271255.0,"I was sort of the opposite. Maybe it’s because I’ve been relistening to a lot of his work, but I feel like his sound is sort of unmistakeable. When I was watching the show I was like “hmm this kinda sounds like nine inch nails.”"
television,femvlyy,t1_fekrnf8,1579270785.0,"Didn’t want to end up with another Lost. I liked that show but man did it go on too long. Good on him for having a specific vision, executing it, and walking away. 

I’m not really blaming him for Lost dragging on though - I don’t think he and Cuse were given as much control over how long it went. Sure they could have mapped out the story better but the network really wanted to milk it. 

And honestly it’s gotta be hard. Not every show becomes a pop culture phenomenon! Can’t be easy to walk away. But at the same time, he probably remembers the pressure he was under for what, 6 seasons, doing Lost."
trippinthroughtime,femtcnr,t1_femq6dx,1579269038.0,I don’t think that view requires accepting Jayne’s theory. Could’ve had an intrusive thought or heard voices or had some kind of psychotic break - that does not require you to adopt a position on how consciousness developed. That’s not a view unique to Jaynes.
trippinthroughtime,femt0ed,t1_femk27p,1579268763.0,It’s like your 7th grade girlfriend fake breaking up with you to see if you’re sad enough and if you’re not then it means you really didn’t care about her...
HistoryMemes,fegfvei,t1_fegbyb5,1579091374.0,"Yes I know that she is the queen of many other places as well, I am quite well aware of Scotland and Northern Ireland and the concept of commonwealth countries. I was just talking about Great Britain. 

Now looking it up, clearly I was wrong about what Great Britain actually means. For some reason I thought it was just England and Wales and the United Kingdom was everything else. Wikipedia told me Great Britain includes Scotland as well. Whatever, happy to be wrong."

The only thing that helps me with this really is meditation. I have also been trying positive self affirmations or whatever you call them."

therewasanattempt,fdk90y1,t1_fdjwjbt,1578498819.0,That’s the thing. I have no issue with gender neutral bathrooms. But...if you expect an opposite gender person to wait until you leave before coming into the bathroom then...you might as well just keep gender specific bathrooms.

Still dwarfed in size and capability by the US military, but an all out war between the US and Iran? A goddamned buzzsaw. Especially if we were somehow stupid enough to actually try to invade Iran. Never mind military capability, its terrain alone makes that insanity."

marvelstudios,fdfjnmy,t1_fdfiavv,1578363268.0,I remember really liking The Dark Knight in theaters but for reasons I’m still working on articulating I feel like it doesn’t hold up nearly as well for me as 1 and 3. Maybe because I still remember TDK being absurdly overhyped to a greater extent than the other two. It almost felt like Nolan trying to make a Michael Mann movie with Batman shoehorned in instead of a Batman movie. I really am not sure how to express this thought...

worldnews,fcwduii,t1_fcwb3nw,1578023130.0,"Yes, much larger, better trained, better disciplined, better equipped military. Completely different terrain too. They also don’t have to run supply lines across the planet on top of all that. The U.S. has also now been bogged down in wars in the Middle East for nearly twenty years. We have the manpower and equipment to throw at Iran but it would stretch the military to the breaking point. Such a bad idea. And. If Iran *really* wanted to go nuclear they could choke off the strait of Hormuz but they would have to be pushed really far. I honestly think Trump could be easily sold on nuking Tehran if they did that."
weezer,fcvhegi,t3_eiva1o,1578002138.0,"I think their slump post-dates Beverly Hills by at least a few years. They did get a lot of hate for Make Believe, but then a few years later I remember Pork and Beans getting a shitload of play back in 2008, and had a very popular music video-and that came a few years after Beverly Hills. I still hear that one every now and then. Heard I Can’t Stop Partying a bunch back in the day too although overall Raditude and Hurley were pretty bad (much worse than Make Believe I think). I also think the White Album was pretty well reviewed. 

I’ve heard them pretty regularly on Sirius the past several years too. The usual suspects like Hash Pipe and whatnot. But anyway, I think their recent resurgence goes back at least several years and is bolstered by a string of pretty solid albums."

Here you are thinking that Draper is finally turning a corner at this whatever hippie meditation retreat, finding himself, repenting for all his sins. And then...he closes his eyes on the grass and you see the smirk and the closing credits with the I’d like to buy the world a coke. He doesn’t learn anything on a personal level- he goes back to McCann and he uses his experience to sell more shit. Because he’s gained some insight into how to market to the growing demographic that’s into that kind of stuff. It’s just feigned authenticity all the way down. As someone who rooted for some Draper redemption (against my better judgment) I thought that was a brilliantly bold ending. Just beautiful."

gatekeeping,fc9hvx9,t1_fc8gsof,1577552911.0,"Hm. I have ADHD so (among other things) I get overstimulated and overwhelmed easily. But...I also get bored easily and crave novelty and stimuli and that dopamine rush. With the help of medication I realized I was actually more extroverted than I realized (interacting with people was a stimulus that I actually enjoyed and felt energized by once I was able to manage the ADHD with medication and skill building and whatnot). 

Either way, human psychology is so complex it seems silly that so many people define their entire personality around loose categories like “introverted” or “extroverted”."

CreditCards,fbmdx1s,t1_fblp4a4,1576982316.0,"Yeah, the “Miles” Card isn’t *bad*-that’s a decent cash back rate. Its just that “Miles” is a bit of a misnomer as it’s rather mediocre as a travel card. But decent cashback. It’s basically the same as the Chase Freedom Unlimited or Capital One Quicksilver except issued through Discover. 

I don’t mind having a Discover Card even though they seem to have axed many of their good benefits. The free SSN and Account Alerts are cool, as is the FICO credit scorecard. No monthly fee. It was my first CC 10 years ago. The rotating categories aren’t much use for me but I just keep it for recurring charges like Netflix so it doesn’t get closed."
