AskMen,fflxdq5,t3_eu5dia,1580045380.0,"When I was in high school, a couple friends and I decided to go coyote hunting at night, in the middle of January. No flashlights, and only one ancient Marlin .22 between us. I had my predator call which sounds like an injured rabbit. 

After calling for a few minutes, I suddenly felt something was wrong. We retreated to the inside of an old school bus that was nearby. We stayed the night in there, since there were several boxes of moving blankets inside. 

The next morning, we noticed tracks in the snow. Wolf tracks, not coyote. It was obvious that we’d been stalked. The tracks circled the spot we were calling from, and followed us to the bus."

Everything was in good shape, and all bolts were tight. Some had jerry-rigged a K&N filter onto it though, and I’m guessing they also drilled out the muffler without richening the fuel mix. 

It has the Tillotson carb, which I’m rebuilding too. The carb has a plastic 90 degree fuel line adapter which has some hairline cracks. I’ll see if I can eliminate that adapter altogether."

Since only headshots will do the job, might as well go with .22LR. Quiet, accurate, lightweight, reliable, and you can easily carry 500 rounds in your pockets. 

Also, since zombies can’t shoot, you might as well wear armor. No zombie would be able to bite through Carhartt pants and a hickory logging shirt. Hell, you could even wear chainmail. You’re defending against small, blunt human teeth, it’s not hard."
