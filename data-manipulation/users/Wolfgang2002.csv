anime_irl,ffa3bkb,t1_ffa0y6b,1579727046.0,Yes.
TombRaiderKing,ff9v4w9,t3_es21cn,1579722148.0,"Hi u/TriggerHappy_Yt ! 
Please mark anything beyond the Jaimini's Box translations (currently chapter 36) as spoiler next time. I marked them for you, but do so yourself next time."
OnePiece,fennoxt,t1_fenfne7,1579288329.0,"Some of One Piece reminds of Shaman King, which does have a similar premise of becoming a king of some kind."
OnePunchMan,fel0l7h,t1_fel0i3b,1579211488.0,The funny thing is ONE designed Saitama to be bald so he could draw him easier in the webcomic.
OnePunchMan,fel04oe,t1_fekzzml,1579211215.0,He looks likes about he is to kiss someone.
OnePunchMan,fel01hf,t3_epi1b1,1579211162.0,"I don’t really like the dub that much, but man is Garou’s voice perfect."
OnePunchMan,fekztxh,t3_epocuy,1579211038.0,Everything is perfect except for Saitama’s nose.
TombRaiderKing,fekik4q,t1_fekifpd,1579200782.0,"I don’t know. Also, side note: light novel spoilers are banned unless they are spoiler-tagged."
TombRaiderKing,fekidsb,t1_fekfd4h,1579200674.0,"Yeah. Sorry to tell you this, but it’s going to be a loooong wait to the next chapter with the release rate that JB does. The light novel is being translated though by Wuxia World."
TombRaiderKing,fekd5wr,t1_fekcywe,1579197567.0,Because they’re illegal and they’re claimed by the owners of the Korean page (mostly like the author and/or Kakaopage).
TombRaiderKing,fekct5o,t3_enlfyc,1579197358.0,There is currently no official release. Only group doing it (other than a few small sniping groups that don’t usually do good translations) is Jaimini’s Box.
TombRaiderKing,fekanhp,t1_fe19g4p,1579196082.0,"Those are aggregators (using translations from other groups that they didn't make without permission). Plus, those aren't official translations."
manga,fecurd2,t1_fe6uz1b,1578985416.0,I got about 500 individual volumes (about 454 if you don’t want to count omnibuses as multiple books) and my collection is starting to slowly build. Plus some of the stuff I have isn’t digital at all (even in scanlations) or is out of print. Plus I don’t usually get to enjoy the volume extras if I read digital a lot of the time.
animenocontext,fecuaxv,t1_fe7p4if,1578984900.0,I would remove the post in this case. People won’t want learn unless something’s done.
manga,fe2l0fh,t1_fdzx64e,1578839721.0,Definitely. I love pre-ordering books before they come out and that fresh hot off the press smell when they arrive. It’s an awesome smell.
manga,fdzwi6l,t1_fdzwer2,1578797487.0,Different people have different preferences. (I do read digital sometimes though).
animenocontext,fdl895b,t1_fdl7vul,1578518721.0,"I haven't read Flowers yet, but no. Flowers is done. It's followed up by Shaman King Superstar which I also think is complete.  Only thing I can find ongoing for Shaman King is the spinoff Red Crimson."
TombRaiderKing,fdkqxei,t3_ei695k,1578509296.0,"Remember Rule 2.2:  Do not discuss anything past the point of the JaiminisBox translation without spoiler tags.

Just a reminder."
manga,fdeb6xr,t3_ekw25o,1578335203.0,"Do you want your chapters to look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/bOom9.jpg) or [this](http://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire2/874ad4ff4f4b805b803d1fb607c0b1dd1413876866_full.jpg)? It's what happens if manga artists don't take their time. Plus, when monthly is serialized, depending on where it's serialized can mean how long the chapters are (monthly magazines tend to have longer chapters than weekly ones)."
manga,fd3eqpw,t3_ejwlhw,1578157634.0,Mmm... good choices. Hope you’ll some day be able to have shelves of manga.
OnePiece,fcvul85,t1_fclolbj,1578010449.0,"Wrong. The translations we got have made up stuff and are translated from Japanese to Korean to English, which messes stuff up. One of our spoiler providers [tweeted](https://twitter.com/newworldartur/status/1212056725202898958?s=21) about many things wrong with the current translation."
todayilearned,fcshtn9,t1_fcshjup,1577916790.0,"True. Goku is based off the Monkey King in The Journey to the West. Seems like everything is either inspired (directly or indirectly), based on, or plagiarized from something."
blunderyears,fcse7dg,t3_eh9ay0,1577915281.0,You look like L from Death Note.
todayilearned,fcrwdjt,t1_fcr9ppy,1577907532.0,Dio’s British though.
todayilearned,fcrvyle,t3_eijlap,1577907361.0,I’m more excited that Luffy from One Piece will be there.
OnePiece,fcosty5,t3_ehrsiu,1577840598.0,Woah. I thought I was looking at a screenshot from the anime for a second. This is really good. (Though I know the animation has been crap until Wano recently).
TombRaiderKing,fcnbquj,t3_ei0tzj,1577808242.0,JB hasn't fully ceased their work. It's only their WSJ series.
gifs,fcn9yhv,t1_fcn2zes,1577807021.0,It’s really just like it’s one joke that has been said thousands of barely different ways.
scanlationdrama,fbv6l99,t3_edoput,1577126365.0,"> It seems that JB were only scanlating WSJ because mangostrim were.

You ignore the fact JB was the original and first team to scanlate Black Clover. They only did One Piece after MangaStream sniped Black Clover from them."
