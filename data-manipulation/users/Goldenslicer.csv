NuclearPower,fgj7e2a,t1_fgj0ete,1580838406.0,"> Many studies have shown that PR campaigns do not work in nuclear as they come of as disingenious.

I’d be interested in reading the source on that.

Forgive me for saying this, but your comment exudes an aura of jaded defeatism.

If the most common reasons why average people oppose nuclear power stem from misleading half-truths, misinformation, and baseless fearmongering, then I believe it absolutely can be remedied with education on the topic.

What if we have another tchernobyl?  
Well, let me tell you how the tchernobyl reactor suffered from poor safety design and incompetently trained personel and how we would never in a million years have another tchernobyl.

But nuclear waste is super dangerous!  
Well, for every tonne of waste produced by a nuclear power plant. A coal-fired power plant produces tens of thousands of tonnes of CO2 as well as many other pollutants.

You just swat them away because they’re so easily swattable."
facepalm,fggpurj,t1_fggn7ss,1580766935.0,"I guess some people are just so thick that they cannot comprehend you can disbelieve in a god but maintain that innocent lives shouldn’t be snuffed out for bad reasons.  
Oh well."
facepalm,fggehbk,t1_fggc4gj,1580760173.0,"I do believe you should do whatever you want with your body. That’s why I’m against abortion. It’s not your body, it’s the baby’s body. Hands off."
facepalm,fgg9ena,t1_fgg84eo,1580757082.0,"This is hilarious. It truly is.

I really hope I didn’t start a discussion with an 11 year old myself, inadvertently. Because that’s what you look like.

Why don’t you put on your big girl pants, stop being a little bitch, and engage the actual argument?"
facepalm,fgg8xcm,t1_fgg846x,1580756789.0,"If you’re just going to be flippant, I’m not interested in continuing this discussion. Make an argument for abortion or don’t."
facepalm,fgg7t4s,t1_fgg7kyi,1580756106.0,I don’t see how we can have a productive discourse if you’re just going to hurl insults half of the time.
facepalm,fgg7nmo,t1_fgg4ncl,1580756012.0,"I reread our comments just to make sure, but no, you haven’t actually said who you think should take care of the baby. You only heavily implied who you think should *not* be taking care of the baby; namely, the 11 year old girl.

So, neither of us answered that question thus far. Allow me to do that then.  
Put it up for adoption."
facepalm,fgg6ris,t1_fgg4lll,1580755463.0,"Not wanting innocent children to be killed off is batshit crazy, apparently."

facepalm,fgg4h6v,t1_fgg3upn,1580754056.0,"Please google the definition of atheism and then do so again for pro-life or anti-abortion. And then please point out exactly where they contradict.

The fact that there is significant overlap between the set of atheists and the set of  people who are pro-choice, and that there’s significant overlap between christians and people who are pro-life doesn’t mean anything."
facepalm,fgg43fn,t1_fgg3nud,1580753820.0,"Yes, you are right.  
And if there is any justice, the law will be changed one day."
facepalm,fgg3kz8,t1_fgg2pgc,1580753504.0,I would be happy to defend my beliefs. Would you like us to discuss how they are allegedly contradictory?
facepalm,fgg3bkk,t1_fgg2nzk,1580753347.0,I’m not just implying it. I’m saying they are murderers. And whether I’m being judgemental or detached and dispassionate doesn’t change the facts.
facepalm,fgg2zlu,t1_fgg1hl4,1580753144.0,"The the GOP disagrees with me. Whoop-de-doo.  
I don’t care if you call me pro-life or not. What I want is to limit the number of murdered children. But life isn’t all black and white, and in cases of rape I think abortion should be legal.

We both reject the ruling on the 11 year old so I don’t understand why you’re asking me who should take care of the baby. It’s as irrelevant as if I were to ask you the same thing."
facepalm,fgg25j3,t1_fgg1p7y,1580752613.0,"You are free to do so.  
There’s nothing I can say to change your mind on that."
facepalm,fgg0pdk,t1_fgfz74i,1580751721.0,"It’s obviously not her fault in the case of rape.

I was arguing about the macro picture. The vast majority of abortions do involve a pregnancy caused by rape.

But of course you’d immediately go to a micro-example and imply it’s the general case.

If you want to know my stance on abortion in cases of rape, I’m actually more lenient on that. I wouldn’t make abortion illegal under those circumstances."
facepalm,fgfylrh,t1_fgfxpte,1580750433.0,I’m an atheist btw
facepalm,fgfx6pg,t1_fgfoisk,1580749560.0,"So because the parents fucked up and had a kid they didn’t want, it is now the responsibility of people who want to prevent the murder of children to raise?  
What a flip flop of accountability and responsibility."
facepalm,fgfwsxy,t1_fgf7ub2,1580749323.0,You’re right. Better to kill them off.

If you ask me the confusion lies in the fact that people tend to equate “renewable” with “clean”. Nuclear is definitely much more clean than any fossil fuel.

And I was an *asshole*. There were evil choices with no clear gain or benefit to me. Like you can be evil for the sake of being evil. But I’d choose them no matter what, because they were the most evil.  
It got to a point where even Canderous was like “Woah, dude, chill with that. You have to be smart about being evil. Don’t just go blindly blowing shit up.”  
And that made me think I was doing my evil playthrough wrong."

So you have a rich white male running for office. So he checks all the boxes and according to your reasoning, he won't vote in the interest of society.

No, you have to look at each person's record. White and male have absolutely nothing to do with it. Rich, I admit, has a correlation with how you are going to vote, but again, you can't go off based on just whether a candidate is rich."
