aliens,fegoxht,t1_feghs7f,1579099059.0,"This exactly.  We can only perceive 3 dimensional space, and we can comprehend that there are more spacial dimensions, but we're incapable of seeing them.  There's a Carl Sagan video about him talking about how 2 dimensional beings would see 3 dimensional beings, just as slices suddenly appearing then disappearing.  4D beings or higher would be similar.  We'd just see 3D ""slices"" and it would suddenly disappear.

Also, alien intelligences would be so alien to us that we wouldn't even comprehend it.  Even if they were 3D beings.  Take, for example, when Columbus first arrived at the Caribbean.  The Caribs couldn't comprehend Columbus's ships.  They had no frame of reference that humans could exist on such massive structures.  To them, the ships simply didn't ""exist""...that is, they didn't regard them as something man-made.

We could stare an alien artifact right in the face and think, ""Well....that's a strange looking rock.""  Simply because we have no frame of reference on how something like that, developed with a completely different understanding of physics, in a completely isolated culture from ours utilizing alien understanding of the universe.  We are currently relying on the fact that aliens would be at least somewhat similar to us in someway.  That they would find the ""water hole"" of radio waves interesting, that they even understand and can manipulate radio waves in the same frequency that we can.  Maybe there are other water holes in the cosmos that we just haven't learned about yet.  Maybe while it's easy for us to transmit data in the hydrogen-helium bandwidth, it's easier for another species to transmit in the lithium-neon frequencies."
GhostsofSaltmarsh,fef5am1,t3_eolgxg,1579048514.0,"This is what the players rolled up for the next session:

 

Traditionalist Event (this is a repeat, so the storyline on this will advance...perhaps at this point people are starting to mutter to themselves that Gellan is dipping too deeply into the town coffers for this)

Gellan Primewater imports a variety of exotic flowers that he uses to decorate the town, while also distributing fresh tropical fruit free of charge to the townsfolk

Loyalist Event:

The dwarves make a spectacular find in the mine, sparking plans to expand their presence and the docks.

Scarlet Brotherhood Event: (this is an interesting one...perhaps the PCs will even fall under scrutiny since they are new comers who came under suspicious circumstances)

A small band of escaped slaves arrives in town.  They claim that several sailors at the docks once worked as slave traders, prompting outraged calls for justice from Anders.

Dock Rumors: (interesting tie-in to the Loyalist event)

It's only a matter time before the dwarves dig too deep and unleash something horrible

Saltmarsh Mood: (town is now brimming with fish, need to figure a way to ""advance"" this track as well)

Overall, the fishers are content with their recent results. Here and there, crews boast of good pickings or bemoan their poor haul.

Tasks they rolled up:

 Wicker Goat Job: (duplicate from the last one...so this will advance.  They didn't catch the thief last time, so more equipment gets stolen, and the bounty gets increased)

Track down a thief who stole a shipment of expensive mining gear in Saltmarsh.

Hoolwatch Tower:

Rescue a captive from bandits in the Drowned Forest

Carpenters' Guildhall:

Deck planks stolen from a pirate ship"

aliens,fcyglcw,t1_fcye7ag,1578079771.0,"A matrix for what?  The concept put out in the movie: to make us batteries is horribly flawed.  We consume a lot more energy than we could possibly produce.  You can get more energy out of a potato than a human being.

We just need to look at our own technological advancements to know that pretty much any idea of why they would be here would be flawed.  We would make terrible slave labour.  You know what makes much better slaves?  Robots.  That's precisely what we're working on, and we don't even have interstellar travel capabilities.  Robots don't get tired.  They don't complain when they're sore.  They don't have families to worry about.  You can just keep building them and replacing them as they break down.

Resources of our planet?  There's countless other planets out there that have far more resources than we do.  We really are just an insignificant speck in the armpit of the galaxy with nothing really interesting around us.  And with fission technology, what resources you don't have, you can quickly create.

Entertainment?  Again, I don't see to what end.  We're happily creating all our own virtual entertainment around here as it is.

Biological study?  Why not just send a probe down to collect data remotely and transmit the results back to the home planet?  Again, that's what we do.  Why risk the perils of space travel to go visit some naked apes that like smashing things together?

What really surprises me is the apparent lack of megastructures in space.  We've found stars that are made of diamonds, nebulae that are alcohols, and exotic gasses, planets that are mostly water.  But, where are the industries harvesting these resources?  Where are the Dyson Spheres or Dyson Swarms?  The Von Neumann Probes?

It may be, like this article says, that we're barking up the wrong tree.  Maybe carbon-based life that has the inherent need to smash things together is extremely rare in the universe.  Maybe true intelligence is a super intelligent shade of blue?  There are no megastuctures out there because real intelligence doesn't create megastructures, at least in the way that we understand them.  They could be there, but we wouldn't grasp them.  Maybe pulsars are megastructures created by some intelligence like we initially thought then brushed off as just part of the natural order of the universe."
