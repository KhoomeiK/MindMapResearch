Dogs can do this to show that their alpha. Also is Sam neutered? If not recommend it to his owners. And maybe try informing his owners of what he’s doing, because they may be having the same problem."

BanPitBulls,fdrxbm2,t3_emscuj,1578691149.0,The dog at the end was a pit bull? It looked more of a husky and white German Shepard mix.(Or just a white German Shepard)And it was actually really adorable. Was it actually a pit bull? It really didn’t look like it. Also what did they do with the dogs?

fat,fdlhr9j,t1_fck4sjw,1578524288.0,"True. I have depression, and I’m normal in weight. I’m closer to underweight than overweight (my BMI is 21.1). And I don’t gain weight because of depression. I just blame depression for my feelings not my weight. In fact I eat less because of depression. 

OP should try losing weight, it’s a lot more healthy. I hope she does. I know she’s capable of doing it, she just has to have the confident mindset and work her way to it."

Anxiety,fdisggb,t1_fdigvwf,1578450025.0,"Yea, fear is the worst thing ever. This type of anxiety is the worst ever possible. I try to self talk myself out of it. Sometimes it works, other times it doesn’t. I wish everyone with it the best of luck. I wish you and me can both heal from the wounds anxiety caused."
dogs,fdicx6v,t3_ele34n,1578440059.0,"Video tape what she does to the dog. And maybe try sending an email to them asking if it’s against animal abuse? Even though it doesn’t violate the rules try anyway. 

Also try sending it to a non kill shelter, back to its shelter is a good idea. Talking to her doesn’t seem to work, but maybe try again. Maybe whenever she abuses the dog try distracting her.

Since the dog is on bookshelf’s, she can hold its legs etc, I’m guessing it’s a smallish or medium dog. If it is this can really hurt it. 

You can also ask her if she wants to give the dog away, and give it to friend or family member. 

 Also try to get information for the other pound. She seems like she wouldn’t answer, so say you know a friend who wants a dog, and wants to know where your dog is from(what pound). Something like that. 

I don’t know if this will work, but I’m trying my best. I’m trying to give advice. 

Good luck to you and the dog! I wish the best!

And just remember, although the dog doesn’t feel it, it’s still considered animal cruelty."

Anxiety,fdb7zqz,t1_fdb7b23,1578254798.0,"The worst part about the situation is I don’t have any card to pay it with. I don’t know why but I thought there was some way to buy something without a card on eBay. I don’t really buy there, but my mom does. And I checked her purchases and it’s not there.

I told my mom about the situation, and she said it sounds dumb. She said it’s anxiety, but I’m positive I bought it, even without a card."
