badwomensanatomy,ffzjz6q,t1_ffzjr3c,1580382891.0,"I think I worded it weird but that's what I meant by depending how bad the kidney stones or births were so I agree absolutely that that could be part of the reason. 

My mum once said her second birth was over so quickly and relatively easily that she was glad that our dad insisted they go to the hospital straight away when the contractions started because she would've had a nap beforehand if it had been up to her. Then you hear these birth horror stories where people are in agony for two days straight so I can see how these people would come to different conclusions when putting their pain into relation to something else"
badwomensanatomy,ffzht4b,t1_ffzg3oc,1580379845.0,I commented something similar on another comment thread but MamaDoctorJones (an OB GYN who makes youtube videos) recently made a youtube video discussing someone who didn't know she was pregnant up to the point where she was giving birth. Apparently from her symptoms the first responders initially thought that she had kidney stones and the doctor said that she could see why they would think that. Apparently they are pretty similar pains according to her patients who had both and said patients seem to be split up into two groups one of which says that giving birth is worse and the other one says it's the kidney stones that are worse.
badwomensanatomy,ffzhkbe,t1_ffzfd3i,1580379481.0,I recently watched a video by an OB GYN who said her patients who had kidney stones are pretty much split up in the middle with some of them saying giving birth is worse or kidney stones are worse. I keep wondering whether that is dependent on how bad the kidney stones and births are of whether it's a similar amount of pain that people evaluate differently depending on their criteria.

TFABLinePorn,ffouuiu,t1_ffosc5i,1580082028.0,"To me the middle one definitely looks positive. I'd guess that the lines on the other ones are more faint because you didn't use your first morning urine on them. Hormones are much more concentrated in the morning urine because there isn't as much liquid to dilute them in. That's why the lines are stronger before you have your first drink in the morning and weaker throughout the day when you drank already.(though you probably know that already). Also if the purple one is not an early detection test I'd think that chances are high that you are just not far enough along yet for it to pick it up- after all that's precisely what the early detection ones are for. I'd say it's pretty likely that you are pregnant,that the lines will keep getting stronger over the next few days and that there is nothing to worry about. Definitely get an OB appointment,I'd say.
Edit: though to be super safe you could of course always take more tests in the next few days, that should make it clearer"

I think they are, in that sense, science deniers because they are not only misjudging that risk,they are actually pointing at risks that are unrelated to justify their view-point and often actively refusing to believe data that proves them wrong.

So I wasn't allowed to have breakfast or playtime or lunch until I was picked up. I think she thought I was just taking the piss constantly or something.
MadeMeSmile,fdjtwj2,t1_fdjbvmh,1578487342.0,"So, I study to become a teacher for visually impaired students and idk about the blind population elsewhere but at least in Germany statistics say that only 10% of the blind know how to read braille at this point in time. Maybe she only lost her sight later in life or went blind due to diabetes which often coincides with nerve damage to the fingers that may make reading braille tedious. It also becomes a harder skill to acquire the older you are and these days technology like screen readers make it possible for blind folks to get by even without braille fairy well (even if it's not ideal)"
AreTheStraightsOK,fdjoqb6,t1_fdjonwk,1578481227.0,"I mean it's really sad though it also makes me wonder how they went into this relationship. Like,was it always like this?"
tumblr,fdjl3it,t1_fdjkyem,1578476008.0,"Fun fact: in the German version of LOTR Gollum says ""my treasure"" (mein Schatz) in all the places where he would say my precious in the original. The other day when I rolled around in bed to tenderly stroke my boyfriend's face and I said ""mein Schatz"" I immediately had a flashback to LOTR followed by this weird visceral reaction and now I'm looking for a different affectionate term."
tumblr,fdjkrl3,t1_fdjknu0,1578475529.0,I think the mum called her husband bunny and he called her his treasure (these are actually among the most common pet names couples use for each other in Germany)
tumblr,fdjkcne,t1_fdjg4m9,1578474925.0,Had that exact same situation with a young child who insisted her parents are called treasure and bunny for that reason
tumblr,fdjkaly,t3_elmt2c,1578474845.0,"I remember when we were asked what the  names of our parents are back in kindergarten the teacher ridiculed me in front of everyone because she wouldn't believe that my parents are named Peter and Petra. When I was picked up that day she told them that they should teach me their proper names and was very surprised when they just went like ""why? She knows them already""."
TooAfraidToAsk,fdjcg59,t3_elg1a9,1578465213.0,I am 22 and still sleep with my favourite bear my parents got me as a first gift when I was a baby. It soothes me when I'm unwell or can't sleep.
wholesomememes,fdihn2r,t1_fdhcz0b,1578443123.0,That was my first thought as well and tbh I think I can never eat avocado again
wholesomememes,fdic9jy,t1_fdhltfe,1578439657.0,"Nah. I'm wearing my bf's t-shirt as I'm typing this and it's very nice, too. Key is that it smells like bae and is kinda oversized."
wholesomememes,fdic21s,t1_fdhznqz,1578439531.0,"Actually I tell my boyfriend that he smells nice like three times on average each time we see each other and we live in the same city. Even so, I purposefully curl up on the place in bed that smells most like him when I sleep alone these days."
riskyclick,fdi8uc1,t3_ele36a,1578437814.0,This is the first time in months that I casually eat a can of baked beans and now is the time I see this. Coincidence? I think not
AreTheStraightsOK,fdi1za4,t3_elexm2,1578434302.0,"Are these people multiplying? Because I feel like this is the 'daddy's sticker sheet' post from the other day but less obnoxious. This seems like the kind of relationship dynamic where nobody is the winner,least of all the children being reared by two people where one doesn't do shit on their own accord and the other's solution is trying to train them like a dog."
AreTheStraightsOK,fdewybu,t1_fdewmzy,1578348338.0,"Yeah. Makes one wonder what they usually do (actually no,I don't want to picture strangers having sex but also wtf). The ""naked Hula dance"" is also something else though. Weird."
AreTheStraightsOK,fddq5ma,t3_ekr2bq,1578320992.0,"Apart from all the obvious problems with this I would also like to question why the actual fuck they posted this? Like who just randomly tells the internet that your partner just earned a BJ? (I mean I guess it depends on the website but I am just picturing scrolling through Facebook and seeing this in my neighbours story like wtf)

Edit: Also just wondered whether they display this in their house because of the format? Like do they stick that next to the refrigerator or??"
menwritingwomen,fddm0xy,t1_fddi44o,1578317331.0,Actually thanks for this. I will look for it in my local bookstore. I had seen this referenced in another post before but kept forgetting what the book is called
