The system is also picking different amounts of games for each region which isnt exactly balanced. Only 300 EUW games yet there are 900 LAS games. This is at plat+.

Is he strong yes, but how much of that is from people still not fully understanding how to play against him."

We are also talking about bugged autofills not regular autofills. The bugged fills are increasing your chances of losing because it fills at least 2 people to off roles. Even if it was somehow 50/50 you are losing games you might have otherwise won."

I dont why you bothered listing all those teams, he spent big at all of then except Inter where he had an incredible team. He even sold loads of young talents over the years to get players in to win now, literally the opposite of a project manager.

If Mourinho is a project manager then so is Ancelotti, cant wait to see Everton v spurs champions league final in the next 3 years.

ApheliosMains,fdlr179,t1_fdjzqke,1578530442.0,"All you can gather from that data is a) he is popular (picked and banned alot) b) he only wins 47% of the time. The data doesnt say he is too strong (he is too strong) but all you can tell from that data is people just dont want to see the champ you cant determine why. 

Akalis data proves their are issues because she has a high winrate and high pick rate.

Cherry picking stats and inflating them to fit a narrative is just bollocks. If I made a post and only included a champs win rate you could make any champ look really good or really bad.

An mr grevious wounds item would be too op, how do you make it work? AP champs just wont auto you of you code it to autos. If you code it to abilities you are applying it way too easily to everyone on the other team. They would also have to make it so you could only have 1 grevious wounds item or rammus will buy both, be unkillable as he slaps grevious wounds on everyone."

How can a champion be banned more than 2 times a game and still be picked 15% of the time.

Also doesnt that say he has a 47% win rate so he isnt getting banned because he is OP.

The numbers are inflated to make it look like a bigger problem than it actually is. That's not to say he isnt strong but this is bad stats."
ApheliosMains,fdi8dpu,t1_fdi7221,1578437570.0,"And as I just said it's not possible to have a ban rate of 200% let alone 223% with a pick rate of 15%. Its Impossible. He is either banned or picked he cant be banned by both teams every game and still get played 15% of the time.

Also that says he has a 47% win rate. They arent banning him because he is strong they are banning him because they dont want a new champ on their team."
leagueoflegends,fdi6nyk,t1_fdi5nif,1578436686.0,"These numbers are bollocks, they make no sense. 

Why are they counting remade games as a ban.

Find it hard to believe blue side is banning it every game if they are banning because its op.

And if that column before the build is winrate then he isnt getting banned because he is op he is getting banned because they dont want a new champ on their team"
ApheliosMains,fdi61p9,t1_fdi4vj6,1578436361.0,"So it's not 223% because counting remade games as a ban is just stupid. It also cant be 200% ban rate because he has a 15% pick rate so he isnt getting banned every game.

Not saying he isnt really strong but these numbers are inflated."
