television,fezpjj2,t3_eqsv19,1579460048.0,"Personally I was a bigger fan of the Ocean dub where Goku punches Vegeta and his fist makes the sound of a puma roaring.

But seriously my favorite moment of the show is the triple Kayoken Kamehameha vs Vegeta's Gallet Gun. That whole fight is awesome."
television,fezov9s,t1_fex0eky,1579459811.0,Yeah it's nothing compared to foes later in the series but at this point 9000 is a genuine threat to Vegeta and Nappa and it's also like 10 times what they were expecting.
television,fezogvw,t1_feys5y8,1579459678.0,"Goku was a ""nobody with a low power level"" a year ago. He lost against Raditz who only had a power level of 1200. Just before this scene, Vegeta picks up Goku in the distance on his scouter and clocks him at 5,000. Goku powers up to 9000 before engaging Nappa at all, and 9000 is definitely on par with if not stronger than Nappa.

They were expecting some chump that couldn't even beat Raditz and Goku shows up stronger than Nappa. They have an unexpected threat on their hands. Nappa is done whether Goku is hiding more power or not, and this is obvious when they fight: Nappa never lays a scratch on Goku. In fact Goku only uses the Kayoken once against Nappa and it's only to intercept Nappa before he can harm Gohan and Krillin - otherwise Goku could have easily handled Nappa without it.

As for Vegeta, you're partially right. Part of Vegeta's frustration is because Goku is a real threat to Nappa, but part of it is that unknown. This is the final straw of his scouter proving to be misleading - it has failed to accurately guauge every one of Earth's fighters.  Vegeta knows his own power level is higher than 9000. I think later in the series Freeza's goons believe Vegeta's power should be somewhere around 15 thousand at best (and he of course proves them wrong when he shows how much he has improved). But like you said, if the scouters fail to pick up the Earth fighters' true power, just how high is Goku's power really?

So TL;DR: it's both. Goku is a genuine and unexpexted threat, and their scouters have proven useless, which means he may even outclass Vegeta."

6 years of development and no alpha yet. We've only seen the same, what, 3 or 4 zones for the last 3 years? Bazgrim showed a video of Amberfaet between 2016 and 2019 - that's *3 years* and we're still previewing the same zone. They updated the character models, animations, UI, and lighting in that time, but that's *3 years*. Assuming they only have 1 character modeler, 1 animator, 1 UI dev, and 1 lighting / optimization lead, that's like 2 or 3 months of work, TOPS. 

People will say they're doing other stuff we haven't seen yet, but it's been 3 years and we haven't seen it! Where is Faerthal? They said a year ago that all the core systems were solid and they're going to be rapidly building the world, or at least a whole continent, right? So far we've seen a 10 second teaser of silhouettes cresting a hill.

Where is the summoner? Where is the crafting system? Where did colored mana go? Remember colored mana? Where are the new zones? Can we see any quest mechanics? Can we see new gear or new weapons? Can we see an example of how the stats system works? Can we see the character creation screen? Trading? Money? An economy? A starting city?

Every stream so far has been a group crawling through one of 2 or 3 dungeons. I get that's the core gameplay, but all the elements I listed above: cities, character creation, gear progression, the economy, tradeskills, quests, and dozens of zones - these aren't trivial development efforts.
