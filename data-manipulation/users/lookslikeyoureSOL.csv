3) You aren't a music person i.e. somebody who would generally enjoy music anyway (these people actually do exist)

I am acutely aware of the difference between objective and subjective experience, and this isn't just subjective bullshit. Subjectively *good* music objectively *just sounds better* when you are on the right dose. There is very clearly a powerful enhancement effect, its consistent and its unmistakable.

I often compare it to the enhancement cannabis provides: If cannabis makes music sound ""wider"", then phenibut makes it sound more ""vibrant"". 

The beat, the rhythm, the melody and the individual notes simply hit you way harder.
