Harry and Meghan picked a great country in Canada, I am a happy enough American (excluding the current orange unpleasantness) however Canada is a pretty good country and maybe the best hope for them to have a private life.

We individually looked across the country at different places and many places of course are nice but too expensive for us. The development in Chattanooga was very reasonable and other costs as well.

We have tried a lot of things, sending them “upstate to live on a farm”.

â€œWell thereâ€™s a spiral staircase, thatâ€™s a little done and in wood a generational project.â€

â€œOr one of those home retrofit elevators, most seem a little flimsy and all of them potentially a lead item in your obituary.â€

â€œThere is teleportation, pluses are the distances are small so the power requirements can be met with a micropile reactor or two, they are stackable and you can sell power back to the grid when not going up or down. The minuses would be permitting, frankly with those jerks downtown it would be a nightmare. Having to have a licensed nuclear power plant operator on hand 24/7 and the cost of the crash basic scientific research to develop the technology might get too pricey as well, you might get a why? instead of a wow!, but you know the people you are wanting to impress better than we do.â€

â€œWe do have a hidden staircase option, think of a pull down attic staircase on steroids during a three day coke binge. Powerful to the edge of danger and flipping your jaguar thru the wall of a historic building with an underage cheerleader at the wheel expensive to get right. The downside will include it only working completely correct the day we pick up our last payment and after that if it works at all it will sound like you have a car crusher in your kitchen. You will be sued by the other condo owners and owners of nearby dogs and will have to figure in a give back to the new owner when selling so you can flee the country. We can provide a tight quote for that work by the way and will install it with the idea that it will all have to get removed in the near future.â€

â€œWe suggest the hidden staircase option , itâ€™s all based on existing technology (unlike the teleportation option) and we donâ€™t foresee any issues that your money canâ€™t address fully. We pride ourselves on figuring out things eventually and frankly the whole crew thinks it would be pretty neat! Our price excludes any electrical work as well as any painting and patching. We also do not provide the hydraulic supply equipment.
