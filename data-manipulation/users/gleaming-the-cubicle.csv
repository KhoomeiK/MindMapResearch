Your answers here kinda don't bare that out. You are seemingly more concerned with *prescriptive* medical terms vs *descriptive* cultural terms than with anything. 

First, NO ONE DISAGREES that chromosomes stay the same. Why are you so caught up on that? And do you ask for DNA tests from everyone you meet? ""Sorry Jim, I'd love to call you 'he' but first we have to wait on the lab work""?

Second, you aren't ""defending the English language"" or some such. You are helping no one and actively hurting others. 

Third, you seem to think that it is so inconceivable that more than one person would disagree with you that you accused people of using sockpuppets. Sorry dude, plenty of people realize you're wrong.

Finally, that analogy is for shit. I think I can do better. 

I'm going to assume you, like most people, are right handed. Now imagine if in school they had forced you to use your left hand. 

You can get the job done with practice but it will never feel natural and your handwriting will always be messy. You will always have to put in an effort the kids who are really lefties never will.

 In fact, when you bring up that it's uncomfortable for you they say ""No. It isn't. The left hand feels very comfortable for me so obviously it is the proper method."" When you say that you just don't feel that way, they say you are just lying for attention. 

You finally work up the courage to say you've been secretly practicing with your right and your handwriting has never looked better and it just feels right. You declare you are going to use your right hand no matter what. You hope you don't get thrown out of school but even if you do, at least you will be able to write the way that you were born to.

Then some petty jackass starts in with ""Actually, since you've written 10 thousand words with your left and only 600 words with your right, statistically you are left handed. That's just how math works."" He smirks with the satisfaction that can only come from not having a dog in the fight and considers putting the incident on his ""Libtards REKT with FACTS and LOGIC vol. 6"" reel."
