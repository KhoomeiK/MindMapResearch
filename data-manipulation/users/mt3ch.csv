synthesizers,fcjvlh7,t1_fcj8jao,1577706888.0,"It's interesting for me to hear other people's perspectives too and to hear that many people have fond memories of this keyboard. As I said in another comment, I'll probably appreciate this keyboard more by MIDI'ing it up to my new full-size digital piano as I start learning to play again."
synthesizers,fcjvd2w,t1_fcjlflu,1577706566.0,"As a 16 year old i was a big fan of the likes of Thomas Dolby, Howard Jones, Herbie Hancock, etc. I wanted to emulate such greats. It's great that your friend did this but he was probably already an accomplished musician. I wasn't at all and I wanted to learn. It was too difficult to do so on small keys. I was also interested in sound synthesis and played around with the PSS680 for a bit but it was too limited to hold my interest. I remember Art of Noise had a track on which they played a section entirely on a PSS-680. It was instantly recognisable to me. It sounded terrible next to everything else. Out of the 200 built-in voices only 3 or 4 sounded good to me. I'm just saying it was a life lesson for me not to be dazzled by quantity over quality. I think if I got it as a younger kid i would have loved it and have fonder memories of it now, but at 16 I was ready for something more serious whereas this felt more like a toy. I just regretted buying it instead of something else. That's not to say it wasn't good for what it was and for the price but it was more quantity of features over quality in my view.

Did your friend upload the album anywhere? I'm curious to hear it. I recently got back into keyboards and got an Alesis digital piano with 88 full-size, hammer weighted keys. Perhaps I will appreciate the sounds of the PSS-680 more when it's MIDI'd up to a proper full-size, velocity sensitive keyboard?"
synthesizers,fcit11c,t3_ehchee,1577669112.0,"I still have one but I never much used it. To be honest, it does not sound good. The voices are limited. I was 16 when I got it and was sold on the ""200 voices"" claim but they sound 90% similar (many are variations of fart noises). You can't really make any decent music with it. I regretted not getting something with full-size keys, and fewer but better sounding voices. We were poor and I was not able to buy another keyboard and  by the time I could I had moved on to other interests. I think if I had bought a decent sounding one with full-size keys I might have continued to play and I'd be a proper musician by now. The drum machine is quite good though.

Sorry to moan about it here. I just felt like expressing my honest thoughts and feelings.

I've often wondered what i should to do with it now it seems to have become somewhat of a collector's item. Any ideas?"
IAmA,fcaw2df,t1_fc9guq1,1577577744.0,"The solution would be to allow users to report false reports. It's likely that there would be more legit users than malicious and the false report reports would outweigh the false reports reversing the hiding process.

Or at least flag for moderator attention."
