StarTrekTimelines,feesj2a,t3_eoog3h,1579040281.0,"I picked up extra stars for COP Founder Picard, Data V, Cult Leader Dukat, Assimilated Hawk. Lt. Comm La Forge, and Soar Sails Sisko.  I also picked up EV Burnham, Klingon Bride Jadzia, Interfaced Barclay, and Juliana Tainer.  Plus I picked up Bones. I'm about 1000 gauntlet rounds from Locutus, so I'm saving some cites for him.  I'll have to figure out how to use the rest."

BSG,fcm72a9,t1_fcl1bji,1577765921.0,"It's bittersweet.  Yes, they've escaped but they aren't free.  They just get to return to being on the run with no end in sight.  They've lost so many people - they don't even know how many.  The Pegasus is gone and the Galactica is shot to hell.  People are suffering from PTSD and survivor's guilt, and they know they have collaborators and traitors in their midst.  Saul and Kara understand this is not a victory."
