Video doesn’t get deleted on its own. Especially key evidence video. You can distrust the pathologist because he was hired by the family, but the fact remains the hyoid bone was broken, and that suggests murder as well.

Even if he did commit suicide, prison staff were paid to let it happen. **Both** guards decided to nap at the **same** time? If they were lazy fucks who took turns, maybe I’d believe it. How did Epstein know that both guards watching to make sure he didn’t kill himself were asleep, so why did he try at **just** the right time?

So much doesn’t add up, its obvious what happened, even to the strongest skeptics.
