I used to have two coworkers who sorta took turns being bald.  Their skin tone was pretty close so I kept mixing them up.  It got to be something of an office joke.

Which did not save me when I accidentally mixed up my supervisor and the department head.  But that's a story for another day."
Showerthoughts,ff2munv,t3_er5mf7,1579513861.0,"Best example of this I can think of this that I can think of: Anna Nicole Smith.  She was a Playboy Bunny who made a career out of being an over-the-top blonde bimbo model/personality.  When she was in her 20s she married an octogenarian who died a year later.  Although she was not mentioned in his will, she claimed that she had been promised half the estate.

Naturally this did not go over well with the kids from the husband's first marriage.  Cue the court battle...which made it all the way to the US Supreme Court.

Anna Nicole had always loved the camera and never turned own the opportunity to be photographed...until the day that her case was heard by the Supreme Court.  On that day, the world saw a different Anna Nicole.  One that looked and sounded like an adult.  One that told the swarming paparazzi, ""Please. Not today."" 

When she died a few years later, the pictures that were taken of her as she entered the court room were the ones that the media used to cover her death and its aftermath."

I know I need to speak to the daughter.  Unfortunately the daughter didn't give me her phone number.  Or her email address.  She probably gave me her last name but I don't remember it.  Therefore the only way I know to get her contact information is through the caretaker.  :-)

And yes, I know the daughter isn't obligated to give me anything.  However, I am hoping her better nature will prevail and we can come to some sort of short term agreement.  She didn't strike me as a bad person.  She just isn't interested in being responsible for her mother's properties.  That is fair enough.  

If the daughter isn't willing to parlay that's fine.  I will start looking for a new home immediately and I won't worry about having the place professionally cleaned before I go."
legaladvice,fdpec9u,t1_fdpb90w,1578626454.0,"I'll give the caretaker a call tomorrow.  I don't think the daughter has PoA but I'm also not sure the landlady is able to enter into contracts any longer.   Ideally, what I would like, is an agreement that I will have 90 days after the landlady's death to find a new place to live.  This is a college town and the rents jackrabbit with the seasons.  Having 90 days to find a new home will give me greater flexibility about where I live and how much I pay."
