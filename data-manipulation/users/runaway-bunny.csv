fatlogic,ffkncd8,t1_ffkdl1v,1580025597.0,He didn’t even use the word “communism” once. And if you think opt-in government health programs equate to “communism”... I don’t know what to tell you

fatlogic,ffjwyri,t1_ffjvw9v,1580009234.0,I’m so sorry I made the mistake of looking that woman up. Imagine having a personality so centered around consumption that you have “donut queen” on your professional website home page.
fatlogic,ffjwnhb,t3_etyw1k,1580008981.0,"“Over 95% will fail at this” yeah, keep telling yourself that to make you feel better about letting yourself go. How would you even statistically define “fail”? Where is the source? I must know a bunch of outliers, because everyone I know who balanced their diets and added regular exercise both lost weight and kept it off. Maybe the ones who do Nutrisystem/Flat Tummy tea type shit or restrict/binge are the 95% referenced, because that’s the only way this makes sense."

You could flip her mouth upside down and it’d look the same (try it!). Even in people with naturally plump lips, there is a slight size/shape discrepancy between the top and bottom."

rabbitsofreddit,ffgtoxv,t3_etj4z1,1579914797.0,"I would say no. 4 out of the top 5 ingredients are wheat and soy, which are just fillers and low in nutritional value. Basically the bunny equivalent of a bag of chips. I got a 20 lb bag of Simple Harvest at Tractor Supply though for $27, and that’d last me two months if I only had the one bunny (I have two!) I usually get Garden Select, but that’s even more expensive lol."

ladyladyboners,ffg9epx,t1_ffg8x3f,1579901301.0,"I do not take the woman’s side no matter what. I am far from a man hater. So, strawman argument there. Who is “people like me”?! Please, tell me! But I loosely followed the reports while this was going down, and she was not only an activist for people coming forward even when they would be disbelieved, even when their partners were more powerful, but the media and public put her through the ringer because Johnny is so beloved to many. She was called a gold digger, and much worse. Said she was “doing it for attention”, which so many women are told as a way to dismiss even legitimate claims. I don’t know enough about her or her history to make a full character assessment, but I remember she was hardly given a chance."
ladyladyboners,ffg74ka,t1_fff5s0u,1579899891.0,"No, Johnny sued her because of an op-ed she wrote in the Washington Post describing her experience living with him. He wanted to keep it hush hush and protect his reputation, so he sued her for defamation. She has not ever said she was “lying under oath”. The court case you refer to was actually settled in court. Amazing what information was “right at my fingertips :) But canceling people is fun and makes us feel so big, so let’s do that, right?"
AmItheAsshole,ffew6vl,t3_eszvls,1579868085.0,"YTA. Tonight for dinner, I want you to eat a plate of UNDRESSED lettuce, arugula, and mixed berries while watching a Food Network show of people enjoying delicious, full meals in front of you, including cake for dessert. See how you feel after, emotionally and in terms of fullness."
