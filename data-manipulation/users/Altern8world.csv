I am absolutely in no way saying that I'm some sort of psychic, but I haven't been wrong when it comes to this particular feeling.

OP or anyone else who knows this person IRL, you need to speak to someone and do it now. If you don't, I have a feeling that you will, under no doubts, become yet another statistic. If you have mental health issues, are medicated or are seeing a specialist, please make an appointment as soon as possible. From what I can make out, your mental health has been deteriorating for the last few months and it looks to be in the form of OCD, depression and anxiety. I don't think you are very well buddy and you need to speak to someone.

If you read this OP, you are welcome to PM me. I'd like to help you if I can or help arrange something which will."

ChoosingBeggars,fdis3i0,t3_el5446,1578449795.0,"Try looking at it from a different angle. This highlights the fact that people are in such an awful situation financially, that they have to resort to asking strangers every month to help pay their bills or buy food. 

So millions of people live below the poverty line, even in the most developed countries like America and the UK. The worst part is most of them are actually children. Parents often go without eating to ensure they can feed their children.

Now don't get me wrong, of course there are people who take advantage of kind hearted people. But believe me, those kind hearted people have saved many lives.

Just another way of looking at things. Perhaps help ease your annoyance :)

Edited = a word"
