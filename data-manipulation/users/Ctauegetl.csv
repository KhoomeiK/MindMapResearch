whowouldwin,fcztkf9,t1_fcyzb3e,1578108374.0,"Monsters take damage based on how much the attacker hates them. It's why a pacifist deals next to no damage while a genocidal maniac gibs everybody instantly. The humans hated the monsters, which is why they stomped so hard, but monsters can definitely kill a human (as seen whenever you get killed in Undertale).

Going back to Jojo, a monster could definitely beat someone like Holly Kujo. Maybe Josuke without his stand, if the monster doesn't insult his hair."

Also, I'm noticing that the character keeps slipping off corners, which I personally think is annoying because it's like the game acknowledges that you landed on the platform, but didn't land well enough for it to count."
