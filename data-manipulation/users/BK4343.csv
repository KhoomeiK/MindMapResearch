dogs,ffgmufn,t3_etf2nf,1579909909.0,I've seen shelters flat out lie about a dog's breed when said dog is clearly a pit or pit mix.
dogs,ffgml15,t1_ffghsfl,1579909734.0,There's one several posts up who defended it.
BanPitBulls,ffglxl6,t3_etgcsv,1579909294.0,"I went to the original sub and they are roasting the OP. Not just for taking in a stray pit, but for his guncentric re-telling of the event."
Dogfree,ffgkj1r,t3_etgj2m,1579908343.0,The worst offenders are the ones who post pics of their pit bulls in stories about pit bull attacks.
Dogfree,fffp9kt,t3_et1uug,1579888834.0,"Most of these issues could be resolved with training and setting boundaries. Oh, but that will kill the poor doggie's spirit, and we can't have that!"
BanPitBulls,fff8llk,t3_et9ktu,1579878420.0,Why would anyone choose to own a dog that has to be managed so closely???
Dogfree,ffdyfkq,t1_ffdwpbt,1579832040.0,"The one I posted earlier was a prime example. Broad said that a one year old child ""charged, at her pit. Um, what????"
Dogfree,ffdr9o2,t1_ffdqpac,1579826989.0,How much of an assdouche do you have to be to do this?
Dogfree,ffdr7s9,t1_ffdqgzc,1579826957.0,This is 100% true. Most of them assume that I hate dogs. Some have even threatened to snitch on me in this sub and let people know I have a dog. I have to let them know that me being a dog owner is not a secret.
Dogfree,ffdpcs2,t3_et21bo,1579825784.0,Don't forget how they must post pictures of their meat grinders so that they can tell us how they wouldn't hurt a fly.

Dogfree,ffdcvfz,t3_esy9e5,1579818201.0,"The reasons I hear from people who say they trust dogs over people:

Dogs don't judge you, talk about you behind your back, or abandon you. They always listen to you, and are loyal in a way people could never be.

News flash: dogs don't do any of that stuff because.......they.are.not.capable. They are not humans. Their brains don't work like ours. They simply can't. Here's a few other things dogs can't do:

Hold an actual conversation about any topic. Call you out on your bullshit when you're wrong. Share the same level of intimacy like a human. I could go on, but those of us with sense get the point."
Dogfree,ffcy9mt,t1_ffcxhrq,1579809756.0,"A few people brought up my post history here and another sub, so they assumed I was trolling. A few others talked about how certain behaviors didn't bother them and other stuff. No one really answered the question though."
Dogfree,ffcsp29,t3_esui2k,1579806470.0,"I asked a similar question on a dog related sub a while back. It didn't go over well with the nutters there, as I expected. Lol"

Dogfree,ffbuig7,t1_ffb5aoh,1579783200.0,"I really hate it when they go after children who get mauled. No matter how young the child is, there will always be a chorus of idiots who will be like ""what did the child do to provoke the dog?"""
Dogfree,ffa712o,t1_ff9vo47,1579729122.0,"This right here. They have elevated dogs to the status of humans, so they feel that dogs should be able to go wherever humans go, off leash, and do whatever they want. Oh, but you're the bad guy for telling them to follow the rules."

Dogfree,ff66h71,t3_erroa5,1579620290.0,"What gets me is how the nutters say ""if you don't like dogs, then don't eat at dog friendly spots."" The problem is that people are bringing them to spots that have not been designated as dog friendly."
Dogfree,ff64y4c,t1_ff5zqfe,1579619234.0,The circle jerk of insanity. These people just make it up as they go.
Dogfree,ff64soo,t1_ff63q9q,1579619128.0,I had to read that shit several times to make sure I hadn't had a stroke first.
Dogfree,ff634ov,t3_erroa5,1579617943.0,"I was also surprised at the amount of sanity in the comments. Of course, you had the obligatory ""keep your kids at home"" crowd show up. Then you had this little gem right here:

This is kinda messed up.....some people have pets as kids.........i have kids but also consider my golden retriever my son too.........he behaves VERY well in a restaurant setting and does not bother anyone.........if they have an allergy go somewhere else to eat imo! it is like saying someone is allergic to children! a pet is a CHILD! anyone who thinks differently should go to a fast food or take out place! we have a right to take our CHILDREN to dinner as parents! it does not matter if our children have 2 legs or 4! get over yourselves! kids are kids! fur or not!"
BanPitBulls,ff4ux1c,t1_ff4l15i,1579573032.0,I've had my dog for almost 11 years. Exactly 0 bites. This broad is nuts.

Dogfree,ff3ol1m,t3_erbywk,1579545502.0,"The insanity I've read against rehoming is downright mind boggling:

Moving: If you're moving and find out your new digs don't allow dogs, then find a new place to live. You should be willing to sleep in your car or under a bridge before giving up your dog. 

Allergies: Whoever is allergic just needs to take medication and deal with it. Also, allergies are not a real thing.

Aggression: Use baby gates to keep the dog sectioned off, spend thousands on trainers, medication, etc. Poor doggo just doesn't know its own strength.

Pregnancy: You should have considered your dogs feelings before deciding to bring a child into the world. So what if the demands of a new baby are overwhelming? Your dog is your first child and deserves better. 

This is just a small sample."
Dogfree,ff3lrvq,t1_ff30vke,1579543760.0,I asked that same question on another sub and got downvoted to hell. They really can't see their own ignorance.

Dogfree,fetju2e,t1_feteris,1579376128.0,The comment section is one big nutter circle jerk. Look at how many of them think that he's an asshole for not worshipping at the altar of dog.
Dogfree,feth6s3,t3_eqb5ri,1579375427.0,"I went to read the Facebook version of this. The nutters were out in full force.

dogs,fesqijv,t3_eqf0ej,1579367965.0,Do not bring this dog home with the assumption that there will be a fairy tale ending where your dad grows to love it. The exact opposite may happen. Get out on your own and then get a dog.

Dogfree,ferstv4,t3_eqcped,1579357990.0,The fact that he thinks his dog has a capacity to understand revenge says quite a lot. You dodged a bullet.
Dogfree,ferse21,t3_eqf6z3,1579357826.0,"Yea, this is not cute in any way. Dog people seem to think that begging is ""dogs doing what dogs do"", so they don't bother to correct it. It's even worse when they reinforce the behavior by feeding the dog from the table.

They will use all kinds of excuses as to why their dog should be allowed in restaurants, grocery stores, etc. My favorite is the one about their dogs being cleaner or better behaved that most children.

They hate it when you tell them that a dog is indeed replaceable. If your dog dies, you could go to any number of places the very next day and get another one. Sure, the new dog will have a different personality, but in the grand scheme of things, it will behave just like every other dog. You may even end up with one that looks just like your old dog."
