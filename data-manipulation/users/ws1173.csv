TheSilphRoad,ff5qhxd,t1_ff4kclo,1579606127.0,They don't want this game turning into people just sitting at home battling with people they don't know. Their focus has always been on community interaction and exploring the world/getting exercise. It makes sense.

todayilearned,femybsu,t1_femxk8z,1579272747.0,"Yes, but when the phrase gets butchered, and then repeated and carried on incorrectly, it's easy for people to no longer understand what the contextual meaning of the idiom is. As you can see by how many people in this thread have expressed that they didn't understand what that idiom was supposed to mean until just now when they saw it reversed (how it was originally)."
todayilearned,femx2qp,t1_femwvlm,1579271862.0,"The way people typically say it ""you can't have your cake and eat it too"" makes it easier to misunderstand because of the timeline. You CAN have your cake, and THEN also eat it later, so you can have your cake and eat it too. But you can't eat your cake and THEN still have it."
todayilearned,femue6n,t1_femub9b,1579269864.0,"Once you eat your cake, it is gone and you don't have it anymore. So you can't eat your cake AND have it too."

TheSilphRoad,fdojqsi,t3_em7p5b,1578606545.0,"If I know I'm going to be walking a lot for an extended period, I'll put some effort into it, but usually not. For example, Saturday morning/early afternoon I usually spend 3-4 hours walking around town playing while my girlfriend is at work. If I focus on it, I can get my buddy excited after about 2-2.5 hours, which means the last 1.5-2 hours I'm earning double candy from my buddy. Other than that it's not worth it."
