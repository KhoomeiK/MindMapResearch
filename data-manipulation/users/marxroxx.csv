That’s been well over a decade and now both parents are long gone.

In the early 90s I happened to be on a business trip across country but located about four hours from relatives in the very rural coal mountain areas of Virginia.
I decided to pay a quick overnight visit and headed out in the early evening after the conference had ended. Within three hours and as darkness set in I found myself having to turn off the interstate onto divided highways onto state route roads onto very narrow mountainous roads. I hadn't driven those roads in a number of years and while much remained the same, at night it was a bit difficult remembering which country roads to turn on and this was well before cell phone and GPS being an everyday convenience, so slow driving was a must. I knew I had to follow a winding river road in the gap of the mountains covered with weeping willows blocking out any bit of moonlight and only the lights from the headlights of the rental car lit the path.
At some point off in the distant, I notice someone traverse the road from left to right and stuck his thumb out in a hitchhiking manner. As the road was very narrow, he was actually standing in the right side of the lane. I certainly wasn't picking up any hitchhikers and as I slowed down even more, I looked at him and he looked/ stared at me with a blank/ expressionless face. I passed him by and looked in my rear view mirror, I noticed he was still standing on the road with his thumb out and facing my direction, still glaring. A bit too spooky. About 30 minutes later I made it to my relatives house and after the initial greetings proceeded to tell them about the man hitchhiking.
They asked what was he wearing and it was at that time I remembered that was what was so odd... he was dressed in a very old fashioned hobo sorta way and as I repeated that information to my relatives, they told me there was others who had spotted a random hitchhiker dressed in period 1920s /30s type hobo clothes and attributed to a ghost of one of the many hobos that used to ride the rails back when the coal mines were still operating and the rails were full of trains.
All these years later and I can still picture his blank face in my mind and his old clothes and while I rarely if ever get back to that region, that night still gives me a bit of a chill whenever I retell the story."
