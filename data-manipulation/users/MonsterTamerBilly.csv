facepalm,ffc6bq2,t3_esslhd,1579792554.0,Is... That a hitlist? Is he describing your targets' clothes so you know who to snipe?
Fallout,ffc5gws,t1_ffbavih,1579791976.0,"\- Well yes. I know a way to make a beeline from Goodsprings to New Vegas with two guaranteed-spawn items: the Stealth Boys inside Goodsprings School, so you can sneak you way through Quarry |Junction's swarms of Deathclaws, plus the dead NCR Soldier in a small coyote den a tone's throw to the entrance of the Divide, which you can loot the armor from to enter Camp McCarran's tram to get a free pass to The Strip. And I'm cool with this being a hidden speedrun strat, but my points remains all the same. Cazadores to the north of the starter town, Deathclaws to the northwest, and in case you want to save the Nipton encounter for Boone, the only way to do so is to still sneak around a deathclaw through Primm Pass. A *BLIND* deathclaw, which is immune to Stealth Boys and can detect you all the same no matter what stealth skills you use. Unless you can outrun it to Ranger Station Charlie and hope for every other NPC in there to gun it down, you're dead. The game goes out of its way with enemy placements and overpowering levels to make sure you do not leave the railroaded route.

\- Boone, yes, as I pointed above, but the other one is Raul. Veronica's points, thankfully, aren't depletable by talking with a named NPC for the first time in the gameplay. Unfortunately, Boone's, Raul's, and even ED-E's, are. And the latter even suffers from an five-day cooldown between his points, which isn't explained or revealed anywhere on the game, which makes it very damn possible to rapid-fire through all his points for no result, due to the NPCs related to these being on close proximity. I really wanna hear the rationale for such a decision, to lock the players out of a companion's quest for simply interacting with NPCs that aren't at first sight related to them until it's too late for you to realize...!

\- Granted, the perks I've mentioned aren't exactly game-changers, but the fact that medium armors still got nothing to either carry their weight better like Heavies do or avoid criticals like Lighties have still smarts on an minmax viewpoint, which is kind of what you have to play with if you wanna deal with the endgame enemies. Medium armor jsut won't carry you through the whole game like a suit of Gecko-Backed Reinforced Leather Armor or even any of the Powers Armors would. Doing some number-crunching, however, shows that the only Medium Armor worth the trouble would be the Elite Riot Gear from Lonesome Road, but... If you can reach it, then you've already gone through the hardest the game can throw at you. So you don't a have a reason to use it anymore...

Well I guess that's all I can defend myself from. Granted, I don't really like having a library worth of savepoints to reload from, so that is definitely my own problem not playing like I should. It is, however, still hard to enjoy a game such as NV when you have the possibility to get route-locked like I did at every step, especially when there's little to no warning about it.

...Also, yeah, it is my own jaded experience with the game after getting through so many New Games and never reaching a playthrough script I was satisfied with aftert so many years. Mods, Bethesda's panacea, can fix a lot of these, but that's to the credit of the fans, not the developers, so it doesn't excuse the many flaws that the game have.

I guess what I'm saying here, after all the huff and puff I did, is not that FNV isn't a good game, in the end. But it's far from deserving the praise that everyone lavishes it with, as well."
Fallout,ffb3b2s,t3_esejsa,1579750706.0,"Funny enough, but I suppose it's because the nostalgia glasses fell out of my face when I tried to play FNV recently at 2019's tail end, and I ragequitted because I couldn't stand the game's glaring faults anymore. Up to the point that, now, I actually consider Fallout 3 a superior game. *I'm well aware I'll be crucified for saying this,* ***but damn did I felt bad for ragequitting the game just as much!*** So here's why I hate New Vegas now:  


\- You can't explore the game. There's ""beefgates"", purposefully overpowered enemies placed on specific locations to discourage exploring that route, placed everywhere around the starting town. You're supposed to go follow the blinking arrow pointing you towards the next quest or you will be dead. This is made much more worse by...  


\- There's a staggering amount of missable quests *for following the damn quest marker* ***like the game is forcing you to do******!*** You're supposed to make an U-turn at the bottom south of the world map then follow the highway back northwest. Said route takes you through, among other things, a raided town, a settlement with a measure of peace, then up to where the quest wants you at. Except that by doing this route, you've already missed two to three ""approval points"" regarding a follower you can recruit at said peaceful settlement, meaning, *before you even get the chance to meet him, let alone recruit him* ***or be aware that his quest needs you to kill enemies you've been killing days before!*** Attempting to talk to the locals at the same settlement will also make you miss another approval point from a follower that's on another settlement too dangerous for you to go at this time, so that's two endings you've already locked yourself out of without knowing... *YES, ENDINGS, THIS EARLY IN THE GAME,* ***AND YOU'VE ALREADY LOCKED YOURSELF OUT OF GODDAMN ENDINGS******...!***  


\- After you find yourself inside the eluvise New Vegas, the narrative takes one hell of a nosedive. Your connections were made plain, and everyone wants to be your pal so that their side comes out on top of everyone else. So hey, awesome, you've got one hell of a bargaining chip to use! And to show you how important it is, Caesar's Legion, the group more likely to be your enemy in everyone's opinion, will bend over backwards and forgive you for killing key personnel from them just to bank on that one advantage you have! Let the negotiations begin, gentl... Wh-what you mean? No, I'm not here to be bossed around like I WANT to join your side all of a sudden, Edward! I'm here to barga... OK WAIT WHY IS THE WHOLE MAP OUT FOR MY HEAD NOW?! I didn't signed up for this! I wasn't given time to prepare to slaughter a whole faction that early in the game, let alone one of the end-bosses! This isn't some starter-level party of bandits, mind you, *this is a major faction that the game ropes you into snuffing out, without giving you time or opportunities to prepare fighting against!* And why? ***Because you didn't felt like suddenly be an evil-aligned character and join them right then and there!*** People complain that Fallout 4 had an excuse for a plot behind the Minutemen, the Railroad, the Brotherhood of Steel and the Institute. People forgot this same flimsy plot was there since New Vegas... I dunno, might be because Chandler Bing and his smiley robot buddy weren't chaffing everyone's perceptions on the fourth game...  


\- You know how the cover of a Fallout game always comes up with someone showcasing the ultimate armor there, right? The T-51 Power Armor in the first game, the X-1 APA in the second, the Midwestern BPA in Tactics... And in New Vegas we have the glorious NCR Ranger Veteran set, with a leather duster covering a ballistic chestplate, a pair of rough jeans, and a gasmask complemented by an infantry helmet. It's no power armor like the other examples, but it imposes respect. *EXCEPT...!* This set is considered Medium Armor, which, I'm sorry to say, the game offers no advantages for using. At all. There are skills that make your Light Armor much more useful for survival. There are skills that made you tank even more than you could before with Heavy Armor. But Medium Armor? ***HAH***! No skills, no advantages, just a go-between the mobility of Light and some of the defensive power of Heavy, but that's it. No critical-reducing chances, no extra defense synergies, nothing at all. It comes to the point that wearing the set in the cover will actively drag your character down because of the lack of skills to cover for these kinds of set. A Leather Armor from back on the beginning of the game would, after a few level-ups, offer you more protection than the set touted as the ultimate for this game.  


\- Oh, and the main counterargument against my points above. Mods. Bethesda's panacea, mods. Let the fans fix what the producers couldn't even be bothered with because they were too busy making Skyrim a better game, amirit... *OH WAIT,* ***SKYRIM HAS THIS SAME ISSUE...!*** Despise FNV being made by the original team that spearheaded Fallout since their humble beginnings tolerating Interplay's abrasive contracts, Bethesda itself only offered a fingerpoke worth of help developing FNV in favor of Skyrim, who'd be launched less than a year later. And then they shut down any financial backing for Obsidian exactly to not deviate sales numbers from Skyrim. And for what? *SO THAT THEY CAN SELL* ***TWO*** *GAMES HURRIED OUT OF THE R&D WITHOUT THE POLISH THAT THEY NEEDED SO BADLY* ***HAD THE PUBLISHING COMPANY CARED A LITTLE BIT MORE!***  


But hey, FNV is bae, innit? With [a warehouse worth of axed content](https://tcrf.net/Fallout:_New_Vegas), incomplete plots, overlapping quests cancelling each other by just following the only route the game allows you to take, underdeveloped landmarks that are rich in hearsay stories but nothing to show for when you go there personally (I'm very disappointed at you, Bitter Springs), nonsensical routes that are covered up by NPC-imposed Fast Travel (when you attend the conference called by Caesar's Legion, you're supposed to go from Cottonwood Cove to Fortification Hill, by canoe might I add... *THROUGH HOOVER DAM?!* I thought that the plot hinged on the fact that nobody by the higher echelon of the NCR could even set foot there, let alone the enemy faction!), numerous people that demand you to kiss their feet without any prior interaction or motive before (Caesar, forgivable. Carcino? Yeah, no thanks, fuck that guy.), and many other points that make FNV feel less of a base game, and more like a hackish fanmade mod held together by ""ooooohhh but it was made by the original team!""  


The DLCs feel like a more satisfactory game than the game itself, honestly. And it took me nine years to come to terms with this."

Basically the prototype for both Pokémon Go and the play-coin walker function from 3DS, but done in a way that you can capture pokémon not from the game's region and farm items to use in the game while you're busy with your actual life. It was even more entrancing than it sounds, especially for what amounts to an 8-bit keychain with only three buttons.

When it was the last time that we've got such an awesome extra mode like this from this franchise? Dream Worlds became a close second but faltered in three years due to the online servers from the Phat DS being shut down. Pokémon Amie was great was very good for what it could amount to, but you were stopping your gameplay's flow in order to use it, not to mention there was no way to acquire new pokémon foreign to the region in there. There have been alternatives but none quite peaked as much as the Pokéwalker did ten years ago.

People expect you to be some kind of super soldier just because you actually were a post-apocalyptic survivor with an actual military background... Or the goofy option, a military wife. Nope, people still expect you to be THE shit anyways! Fuck you and your quest for your probably-dead son, YOU GON HELP US YOU DANDY TIME-TRAVELLER! Now go play SimCity with scrap metal!

For me, the seams of the plot undone themselves when I gone after Nick Valentine. Now don't get me wrong, he is admittedly a gold nugget as a character, but... The place he's at, the quest where it happens, UGH...! Are we just not gonna address the fact that there's an open, unpopulated, reasonably-functional vault that nobody is looking forward to populate and live a better life than in Diamond City? Or any of the settlements I'm building form broken ceiling panes and chipped wood scraps? The gangsters in there are outmanned and outgunned compared to the security detail from there! And they're reasonably skilled fighters anyway, seeing how there's three Raider and four Super Mutant spawn points always pinning them down, and they still come up on top! Why aren't you people taking over that palace of a shelter?!

And speaking of super-mutants, also a counterpoint to my whole argument, why is this vault being used for anything at all when its entrance is basically rubbing cheeks with Swann's Pond? As in, that Super Mutant Behemoth that everyone fears? WHY IS THERE A RAIDER PUB RIGHT NEXT TO HIS LAWN?! WHY IS THERE A SCAM RELIGION AT EARSHOT FROM HIS POND?! WHY IS THERE ANYTHING AT ALL CLOSE TO HIM?! The placement of some points of interest make no damn sense whatsoever when it comes to enemies inhabiting the vicinity! There's way too many settlements flourishing right next to SM camps (FUCKING GOODNEIGHBOR) when four mainline games before it was pretty established that SMs, the norm-faire kill-em-all berserkers anyway, will squash any lifeform that's not themselves within a radius of 2km from where they settle! How come they're suddenly not?!

And to finish, Nuka World. You all already know why. Would be an amazing add-on if there were any plot-related motive for Nate/Nora to do so, but there isn't, not an immersive reason to. The only justifiable reason you'd play it would be ""for shits and giggles"", literally, since the raisón d'etre clashes with the rest of the goddamn game.  


I'm sorry I've gone on a walltext tirade against the topic's question, but... Well, that's why I haven't even tried Far Harbour. Because the rest of the game infuriates me. It may be an awesome, self-contained story that would probably give F4 some salvation, but it's such a migraine-raising slog to even get to the point where it would make sense for Nate/Nora to get to this island. I couldn't do it.  


I really want to love F4. The mechanics are awesome, the weapon customization is everything i wish I had with the mods that did the same back in F3 and FNV. The settlement mechanics are bad, but they served as as basis for the much-superior SimSettlements, and yet there's barely an immersive reason for the protagonist to dedicate themselves to build anything else other than their own old home. Having a skilltree that can max you out in the long-run, Skyrim-style, with a huge amount of effort to even get to this point, is something that I love. *But the goddamn plot...!*"

Financially speaking, when a new iteration of a product doesn't surpass the previous one by a sizeable lucre margin, especially considering the amount of capital invested to develop this new version, then it's considered a failure.

Or, in plain english, if this gen doesn't outsell the late one, then the company gets this close to bankrupcy. Which is what happened. It may have been the best-selling Switch game, but the expectancy for ""the first Pokémon game on this Nintendo console"" is not only to be the best-seller, but to also *make people buy a Switch in order to* ***also*** *buy a Pokémon game.* So there's a lot of pressure for it to sell even more than it already did.

Remember that the majority of the sales for SwSh is composed by people who already owned a Switch due to other games pulling them in (Zelda BotW, Mario Odyssey, FE:TH, etc.), not this one. So the consumer base was already big, but like I pointed above, it's expected to be even bigger than this.

Warframe,fddlqn8,t3_ekelri,1578317055.0,"The only thing I miss from those days was that you could use one Void Key, the back-then thing we had in lieu of Relics, and that one single one-time-use item was good for four people. If used in either Defense or Survival, it was also as good for as many prime parts and mods your patience could muster. Four-hour Survival was the norm back then.

But anyways... Here on my end, the coin is also named ""Death's Emperor"", not ""Cursed Septim"". So try to use ""player.additem XX032228 1"" to get the coin itself.  


Also, instead of trying to remove a perk via the console, you could just use the Scroll of Legends from the mod itself, you know? Enai has long since added this as a means to respec your skills.  You can either cook five Daedra Hearts for it, or you can just get it from the console via ""player.additem XX0422FC"".  


As always, the ""XX"" in both those commands are from which slot in your mod order is your Ordinator at, seemingly slot 53, so blah blah blah same old recommendations you know what to do."

Also, no this ""different scaling"" excuse doesn't stick. Bring them down to the level they should be in comparison to other soldiers. Take away the damage dampening from Index or whatever is that.

And please, can we actually have more care dedicated to the archwings? As in, more Primed mods other than just Primed Morphic Transformer? Odonata Prime is going to forever be the only archwing available? When we'll get some actual game-changing mods that'll make us use gravimagged archguns outside of Profit-Taker? Having a Corvas, a Larkspur, an Imperator Vandal on foot, means nothing when a chintzy Vaykor Hek / Amprex / **regular Karak** outdamages them!
