It was kind of incredible. It was like a slap in the face of ""Is this really what I act like??"" And she relaxed by measurable degrees afterward haha. 

Maybe she needs a kitten."
cats,fguxhlo,t1_fguwz2u,1581131653.0,"She taught me how smart she was that day. 

She is a complete cuddly doll but she really hates other cats. She was a stray before adoption and there were tons of neighborhood fights. She doesn't trust any of them. Even tried with my neighbors super sweet cats.

And I work from home except when I'm traveling so she's my sidekick all the time :)  
She doesn't mind dogs though so have been considering a puppy."
cats,fguvht3,t1_fguv6ny,1581130348.0,"(gender nonspecific) DUDE- she shit bombed my bed and remade it, when she was mad I was away for a few days. She's vindictive. 

But no. Animals are definitely able to be bored. Look at the behaviors in any caged animal. She's not, but she's also probably smarter than a dolphin, and me."

""I have more support than YOU do""

""We need to end prisons!""

I agree. But HOW. How is this happening. 

I'm not listening to the debates for an ego pep talk. I want process."
politics,fguue2w,t1_fguu9bq,1581129644.0,"Like all of them at this point? Everyone is generalizing. Or just saying ""No you"""
politics,fguuai8,t1_fgutyxl,1581129582.0,"I have yet to hear much more than that from anymore. 

I'm not set on any of them at this point. Warren, Pete, Sanders- but I'm not hearing anyone speak beyond political bullshit and negging and digging jnto each other for political bullshit."
politics,fguu3na,t1_fgutu9k,1581129471.0," Dial me in then. 

Cause Biden sounds like a train wreck. 

Maybe point it out?"
politics,fguts9g,t3_f0kxzz,1581129267.0,"Jesus. Biden is a chucklefuck. 

And I have yet to hear Mayor Pete being wrong.

""We need to help people!""

""Maybe people go to rehab instead of jail! ""

""Capitalism values diverse neighborhoods less! ""

""give more money to 6 year olds! ""

"" Encourage black men to be teachers""

How many of those have answers or a path forward. 

Presidents dont forge laws on their own. This is a massive gotcha debate. And the visceral divisiveness between the members is disgusting and damaging.


Warren calling Sanders a Billionaire!! Hahahahah what a manipulator"
