patientgamers,ffimpwd,t1_ffil7ai,1579977574.0,"you can expand your house twice, giving you a kitchen and living room the first time and a spare bedroom, a spare room, and a basement for putting casks in to age wine the second time. the spare bedroom will become a children’s bedroom if you decide to have kids with your spouse. you can buy decorations to put inside your house, but you can also get a lot through collecting artifacts and gemstones to donate to the museum. after certain amount milestones are met, or occasionally after donating a specific item, you’ll get furniture for your house or seeds for your farm. you can also upgrade chicken coops, livestock barns, and farm sheds to make them bigger and give them cosmetic changes

i think you can also get furniture from rebuilding the community center? and pierre sells a furniture catalog and robin the carpenter sells a wallpaper and flooring catalog where you can select any furniture and walls/floors you want

building relationships with the members of pelicantown is also rewarding for the patient. you can give each person two gifts per week i believe? and how much they like you will rise or fall depending on how much they like the gift. it varies by person, but there are universal likes and dislikes if you’re unsure, or you can always check the wiki. after you reach different levels of friendship with someone, you’ll get a time and location sensitive cutscene that fleshes out their character more. there are several for each person, and spouses get one extra after you marry them i believe? i know i got one extra for shane because i married him, but i havent married any others yet

sdv is a good game to exercise your patience with because theres so much you can do while you wait for something else, and the things you can do to pass the time expand as you gain experience on your farm. waiting for your blueberries to grow in because they take forever? plant wheat, it takes 4 days but its cheap so you can plant big fields of it. tended all your plants and its only 10 am so you dont want to just sleep and waste the day? go mining, or go fishing, or go collect wood, or go foraging, or go give gifts to your favorite neighbor. the beginning of stardew can be slow and tedious but it picks up as you get a stronger footing on your farm. and if you make it past your first year on the farm, pierre starts stocking even more kinds of seeds in his shop"

tumblr,fdo3m1r,t1_fdo0hmv,1578598272.0,"according to [time magazine](https://time.com/103826/anton-purisima-lawsuit-nyc/), “Anton Purisima filed his two undecillion dollar lawsuit (that’s $2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) last month, after his middle finger was supposedly bitten and infected by a “rabies-infected” dog on a city bus. A “Chinese couple” took photos of him without asking, Gothamist reports, and he’s routinely overcharged for coffee at LaGuardia Airport. (This is apparently related to the dog bite.)

Purisima has previously sued the People’s Republic of China and several major banks including Wells Fargo, JP Morgan and Wachovia.”

and according to [usa today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/05/19/newser-man-sues-for-every-penny-on-earth/9275225/), “This appears to be at least his 20th suit since 2004, according to Justia.com. Purisima has sued casinos, banks, and the People's Republic of China, among others.”

which generation do you mean, by the way? according to the year of birth of the oldest person alive, which was in 1903, she would be of the G.I. generation, born between 1900 and 1924. that means there are 7 living generational groups that are alive today. generation alpha, the youngest, started being born around 2011 and will continue into roughly 2025, so they couldnt have existed when this guy started his suing tirades. gen z is out, they’re from the late 90s to the 2010s, they were all children as well. *maybe* he could be a millennial, from 1980 to the late 90s, but i highly doubt it. this guy sounds like the most potent combination of boomer and new yorker"
