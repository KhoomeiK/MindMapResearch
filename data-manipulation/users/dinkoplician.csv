Under the principles of free trade, which the EU is strongly in favor of, the best suited nation should produce goods and sell them to others.  This leverages the principle of competitive advantage and results in more wealth for all.  Protectionism is bad because it gives an unfair advantage to one country under the guise of nativism.  Everyone loses with protectionism - the EU consumers pay higher prices.

This is why I believe it is out of character for the EU to engage in protectionism.  For them to advocate one thing in public and then do another in private is contrary to the principles the EU was founded upon."

Dear Kup: 

I appreciated most highly your column of July 30th, a copy of which you sent me. 

I have been rather careful not to comment on the articles that have been written on the dropping of the bomb for the simple reason that the dropping of the bomb was completely and thoroughly explained in my Memoirs, and it was done to save 125,000 youngsters on the American side and 125,000 on the Japanese side from getting killed and that is what it did. It probably also saved a half million youngsters on both sides from being maimed for life. 

You must always remember that people forget, as you said in your column, that the bombing of Pearl Harbor was done while we were at peace with Japan and trying our best to negotiate a treaty with them. 

All you have to do is to go out and stand on the keel of the Battleship in Pearl Harbor with the 3,000 youngsters underneath it who had no chance whatever of saving their lives. That is true of two or three other battleships that were sunk in Pearl Harbor. Altogether, there were between 3,000 and 6,000 youngsters killed at that time without any declaration of war. It was plain 

I knew what I was doing when I stopped the war that would have killed a half a million youngsters on both sides if those bombs had not been dropped. I have no regrets and, under the same circumstances, I would do it again -- and this letter is not confidential.

todayilearned,ffcn2yv,t1_ffckmy2,1579802955.0,Kamikazes weren't common.  They only arrived at the end of the war when Japan was desperate.  Lots of them were bullied or threatened into compliance.
todayilearned,ffcmxl1,t1_ffci3tq,1579802863.0,"
As late as surrender time-even after the A-bombs had been dropped-a staff lieutenant colonel, related to the War Minister himself, was fervently convinced that even if the whole Japanese race were all but wiped out, its determination to preserve the National Polity would be forever recorded in the annals of man; whereas a people who sacrificed their will upon the altar of physical existence could never deserve resurrection. It would be useless for the people to survive the war, anyhow, if the structure of the State itself were destroyed. It was better to die than to seek ignominious ""safety"".

At a climactic last Imperial Conference, War Minister Anami was still talking about going on with the war, of meting out a terrible blow to the enemy and achieving a good opportunity to end the war. Japan must press forward courageously, seeking Life in Death: certain victory was not assured, but neither was utter defeat. The terrain was working in favor of the defenders, and so was the inflexible national unity. But just in case a massive blow against the enemy proved not possible, it seemed appropriate for the name of Nippon to be inscribed forever in history by the annihilation of her 100 million loyal subjects, etc., etc. And tears welled into the eyes of the earnest War Minister.

When the Emperor, by a thrilling act of personal courage, opted for peace-and surrender-he too was weeping. He reminded his stunned auditors that ever since the outbreak of the war there had been frequent cases when Army and Navy actions differed from plans. Now the armed forces were preparing for decisive battle in the homeland and were claiming that the prospects of victory were satisfactory. 

He was profoundly troubled, continued the Emperor. What would happen if Japan plunged into decisive battle under such circumstances? The entire race would be obliterated, and this would be a betrayal of the trust of ancestors and the duty toward posterity, lest Japan never again rise. Continuation of the war, then, could only serve to cripple Japan, extinguish civilization, and bring misfortune to mankind. 

The Japanese Emperor's decision to end the war, under enormous external and internal pressure, obviated the American landings and the hemorrhage that was bound to occur soon on the beaches of Miyazaki, Satsuma, and Ariake. Not only would five US ground divisions, etc., be saved from the destruction at sea which the Japanese resolutely promised them, but untold thousands of Japanese would not die either-such as squadrons of kamikaze pilots and sailors with one way tickets to the shrine of heroes at Yasukuni; or the women and children clutching pitiful staves and bamboo spears.

Once a source of great pride in this country, taken as a given even after a hotly contested election, it's the bedrock of our system's stability. But now it is being recklessly endangered, by the very fools likely to be most badly burned by the resultant conflagration.

I think the change to the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) code of ethics 22 years ago figures importantly. It removed objectivity and unleashed advocacy journalism. (I think most laypeople still think journalists have an ethical responsibility to be objective.) Though it's not my argument journalists can be truly objective, the ethical requirement had them explore ideas that challenged their biases. They learned things. Expanding their knowledge made them more competent, and it even improved their allies' arguments because they had to answer questions.

100 years ago journalism schools used to teach objective journalism (5 W's) while the largest most powerful newspapers practiced [what was called then] Yellow Journalism. Today journalism schools teach advocacy journalism (taking an advocacy position to argue a selected side) while the largest most powerful TV, cable, and newspapers practice [what is now called] fake news. Advocacy journalism, yellow journalism, and fake news are all the same thing ... and objective journalism is considered obsolete from within the profession."
youseeingthisshit,fddhwd5,t1_fdd6i0i,1578312968.0,Hollywood is pathetic. Amy Berg directed a sex-abuse scandal about a catholic priest who molested children and Hollywood praised it to the point of an Oscar nomination. Then she turns around and makes another documentary about a sex-abuse scandal except this time it's actually happening in Hollywood. And what happens to it? It's blacklisted to the point where it has to be leaked on YouTube. That level of power and hypocrisy is gross and enraging.

Blackface.](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2015/10/95646/halloween-cultural-appropriation) Not if you are dressing up as a Black celebrity, or even as Rachel Dolezal, the woman who literally wore blackface in real life. Leave that one alone. It’s like putting a sign on your chest that says, “I’m racist and proud of it!”

This was obviously written before Trudeau got caught in blackface.  Then we all learned that blackface not only isn't offensive, but was never offensive in the first place.  We have always been allied with Eurasia, we have always been at war with Eastasia.
