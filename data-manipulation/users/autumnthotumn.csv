Psychonaut,feu9sdn,t1_feu9erl,1579384558.0,"i c i c. i know everyone says this but the sober alternatives for me have been fruit flavored gum (cause that’s what i would vape) and just endless amounts of hard candys and stuff. Depending on your area there might even be a program in place (or your doctor) to get free nicotine replacements. I have a pre-existing medical condition that qualified me for free nic toning gum, patches, etc but i didn’t really have a problem with the nicotine withdrawal. at least not yet lmfao"
Psychonaut,feu4vh6,t1_fesl96y,1579383112.0,do you usually vape while tripping? most of the time the flavor would like stick around in my mouth for the rest of the trip making me hate it and eventually just ran out of enjoyable flavors
PsychedelicMemes,feqgra6,t1_fb8vhxi,1579341682.0,my first trip was at 17 and i’m only 19 now having an even better time than i was before.
Psychonaut,feqevff,t1_femplyk,1579341061.0,"this is REALLY hard for me to explain but the first time i did shrooms i fucked up and had a really bad time bc i mixed it with way too many edibles and a bad friend. since then i’ve had this feeling of like impending doom while on shrooms even though i wasn’t taking enough to really “trip”. recently i decided to full send with 1.5g of penis envy and when i was alone in my bed i felt the anxiety of the impending doom. i let the anxiety wash over my like a wave, teared up a little. and then it passed. i had felt relieved but i still don’t know what was causing it, maybe being scared of getting scared?"
offmychest,fdrhvfz,t1_fdrhtmd,1578684676.0,what if i do mind
legaladvice,fdr5ji5,t1_fdr51tn,1578679732.0,safe just shipped. i’m honestly more surprised they didn’t do anything about it at edc because there were 7 of us confirming that he shouldn’t have had those keys.
offmychest,fdr4h6d,t1_fdpyyde,1578679324.0,"i’m so glad you put this out there. this kinda sums up what i remember being my first spouts of depression. from classmates being killed in my neighborhood to having to spend the weekend at my grandmas where none of my school supplies are, i had no control over the bad in my life and to be told it was only going to get worse TERRIFIED my feeble 11yo mind.n"
offmychest,fdkls5t,t1_fdjpm5u,1578506192.0,For sweet juice-like flavors a good mango peach with honey is DELICIOUS
