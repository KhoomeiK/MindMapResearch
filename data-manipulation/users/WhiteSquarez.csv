Saying that minorities are less able to accomplish something because of a characteristic assigned to them is bigotry.

Plus, that whole, ""minorities can't get IDs because it's harder for them"" has been used as a defense for years. It's not true. If it were true, we'd see hundreds of stories about thousands of minorities living up to those low expectations you've assigned to them. And we haven't seen that on any kind of scale. Maybe a few here or there might experience such a problem, but for basically every other case, it's just been bigotry and scaremongering.
