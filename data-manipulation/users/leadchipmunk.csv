todayilearned,ffgwelw,t3_eth9g2,1579916771.0,"You are using a specific medical phrase to define one word that is part of said phrase. This doesn't work.

Antisocial has two meanings: ""contrary to the laws and customs of society; devoid of or antagonistic to sociable instincts or practices"" and ""not sociable; not wanting the company of others."" The first definition could be similar to psychopath like you claim, but it is much closer to sociopath. The second definition completely defeats your first claim by saying that it definitely IS the same as asocial. These definitions, by the way, come from the OED."

As for teaware, I haven't had any real issues. A lot of people sell the same exact stuff, so shop around in there a little to find a better price. And I have had one gaiwan arrive broken, but a quick message to the seller and it was replaced. Customer service is everything to them and any ratings less than 5 stars is considered bad, so they do what they can to get it.

The only problem is it takes forever for it to arrive because it comes by boat under the cheapest possible shipping."
todayilearned,fendl9w,t1_fena460,1579282407.0,"> anyone like to tell me why I'm being downvoted for providing further information?

You're being downvoted because it isn't correct. The first modern police force wasn't in America in 1838, [it was in London in 1829](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police#Metropolitan_police_force). It was not created by corporations to keep an orderly workforce, it was created for the protection of people and to be a visible deterrent to crime.

And that is just what's considered the *modern* police force. Prior to that, you had the Paris police force created in 1667. And there was the Holy Brotherhood that was adapted to be the national police force in Aragon (a kingdom in modern day Spain) in 1479. Hell, police forces have been around since ancient China with their prefects enforcing laws."
