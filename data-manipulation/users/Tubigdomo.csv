relationship_advice,ffeh0rz,t3_et6k27,1579847670.0,"The best you can do is to respect his personal space. If anything, bring this up with him how concerned you are still. And work from there"
relationship_advice,ffbhy32,t3_espyou,1579766120.0,Love can make us do illogical actions and only when are you seeing it from the outside in that it was a big mistake. Don’t be too hard on yourself as this wasn’t something you clearly wasn’t emotionally prepared for. Use this experience as what spurs you to be more protective of your own body moving forward
relationship_advice,ffbhj9y,t3_espvld,1579765575.0,Sounds like something to discuss in a couples therapy so your boyfriend figures out what is really going on with his sexual behaviour around you.
relationship_advice,ffbhcyw,t3_espvaa,1579765350.0,"You need to place trust that he will do what he says, which he will not do it when you tell him you aren’t comfortable with it."
relationship_advice,ffbh2u0,t3_esps31,1579764984.0,The betrayal of trust can be very debilitating. You’ll want to step back and re-evaluate his out of character action and if you should forgive him for benefit of the doubt that it was spurred to his grief or keep him at arms length till you feel like you can trust him again.
relationship_advice,ffbgcxa,t3_espozg,1579764076.0,Sorry to hear you have been lead on
relationship_advice,ffbg7gy,t3_espmgb,1579763889.0,"If there is any reason for a potential break up due to you rejecting hid potential proposal, it’s him knowingly told by you that you aren’t ready. It’s disrespectful for him to clearly ignore this. But if you want to stop the horse before it bolts, tell him you are on to his surprise proposal and settle things by reminding him you are not ready. It’s a really sweet gesture but not at this moment of time in the relationship."
relationship_advice,ffbfyov,t3_espkau,1579763588.0,"If you were to end the relationship it wouldn’t be because of what happened between you, your friend and bf. It sounds like you haven’t fully recovered from your previous relationship, preventing you from loving him fully as you can when investing emotionally in a bf. Because if you really are 100% present in the relationship, you wouldn’t let your mutual friend get to you. Because you really should be listening to your heart more than an outsider who thinks they know more than they really do. And your bf’s lack of communication when it comes to outlining his attraction to you is compounded by your hesitation to trust him fully based on your past relationship. A good “we need to talk” is in order to get his feelings about you straight because it’s keeping you from fully emotionally trust him."
relationship_advice,ff8e9mw,t3_es7xzp,1579674813.0,"Its best to approach him by explaining that you caught him texting his close friend in a sneaky-looking way and it raised alarm bells for you. If he was texting normally in front of you it would have been fine. 

Or you can simply ask him when you see him text her what you both are talking about and suss more about them. Because it seems he is close with her. 

The more you know about her the more at ease you will be. Simple asking ""how is Jordyn"" can lead to understanding their relationship more."
relationship_advice,ff8du6p,t3_es80k1,1579674342.0,You need to acknowledge the fact there is someone out there that isn't married that will offer the same support and more than your married co-worker. You just haven't found them yet.
relationship_advice,ff8dr2n,t3_es80q3,1579674247.0,"Agreed. If she isn't ready to move on, then she needs to do that if she can rightfully offer the love you deserve in a even relationship."
relationship_advice,ff1sy4d,t3_er64zn,1579485478.0,There is no fast way to recover. A way to deal with the overwhelming thoughts is to open up about it. Either in public like here or in your own personal diary. Like all forms of relieving anxiety or stress just being able to let it out is a step forward.
listenandvent,ff022hu,t1_fezyd26,1579464398.0,You don’t have to hope. You are!
relationship_advice,fex8u04,t3_equ8hh,1579426983.0,"You have to reconcile that she needs to be fully independent from you. The bond of love has turned into shackles that seemingly turned into resent from how she acted to you prior to the split. 

Give her financial freedom to pay for her own accomodations. I feel you are a good partner so offer her the tree of friendship whenever she feels she is struggling. 

Afterall it’s going to be hard to adapt to the world after it’s only been you two and your child for 10 years. Independence is understandably foreign. 

Also if you haven’t already. Look at or create your bucket list you want to achieve to give yourself a goal to attain moving forward"
relationship_advice,fex7v8n,t3_equ8su,1579426452.0,We don’t know enough of how you and your boyfriend were previously to make informed advice
relationship_advice,fex7sko,t3_equ95q,1579426391.0,Sounds like she is afraid to stand up to your dad’s infidelities so she projects it to you for seemingly not wanting to fight back. You see through it and she should be not wasting her energy at you but at the route problem.
relationship_advice,few9ore,t3_eqr1vw,1579407238.0,That’s weird you didn’t get his text. You may want to test that your texts would get through with him next time you are together
relationship_advice,few65dh,t3_eqr1vw,1579405850.0,Yeah I would wait if I trust him. Or you can message again saying you missed him and hope he is ok because you aren’t used to such long replies back. Out of curiosity how long since you messaged him?
relationship_advice,few48yp,t3_eqr1vw,1579405145.0,Good reasons like he isn’t at his phone because he is genuinely busy or with others and didn’t want to be rude to look at his phone.
relationship_advice,few2xha,t3_eqr1vw,1579404715.0,It sounds like your past with him is keeping you from fully trusting him. I feel you’ll need to resolve this distrust by allowing yourself to accept and forgive him that he isn’t the same person as he is in the past. And the long replies from him is for good reason.
relationship_advice,few1zs5,t3_eqr1np,1579404365.0,"If you are really concerned, it’s best to tell them you want to split the bill before you go to dinner. It’s like a housekeeping rules when it comes to you on dates so the night goes smoothly in the end. You can mention is a sweet gesture to do for you but you aren’t that type of person."
relationship_advice,few1clv,t3_eqr1vw,1579404069.0,What makes it hard for you to trust him?
listenandvent,feuhygt,t3_eqjicn,1579386698.0,"We are all needy to some degree.

The thing is as human beings we always chase what we need to give us meaning and comfort in us. It doesn’t even need to be about a person, it could be like being needy to be recognised at work. Feeling needy is quite common in all of us.

Fortunately you aren’t going to feel needy alone. It makes you relatable and companionship takes many forms, including friendship. Friendship can be as important as partnership.

And also Moon, just because you were rejected doesn’t mean you don’t have everything in you to be loved. Every single individual person has different wants and needs. For example if you were a circle object they may only have a square hole that they will accept for a relationship.

Be proud of being a circle, because the people that we want to love us are the ones that accept all sizes.

You and everyone here has all they need to offer and give love that any person is lucky to have. 

Continue loving and searching and needing because the way life works is it doesn’t hand out to people who sit around, but give to people who constantly seek and try."
relationship_advice,ferix68,t3_eqgboo,1579354473.0,I don’t want to do this anymore is more than enough because it sounds like you need to first take care of yourself before you can fully give justice to the love you want to give. Sometimes we aren’t ready for a full blown relationship at this point in our lives and that’s fine. If the spark isn’t there it’s less about him and more about the needs you want. And what you want in a relationship is something you can’t give at this time for him. It’s always hard to be the first to break up so it’s normal to find it difficult to do. Just reassure him it’s not him. But it’s that you feel there is a girl out there who can love him more than you can at this time.
relationship_advice,feo8mvz,t3_eq6a1m,1579296637.0,"It sounds like you’ve evolved from a partner relationship to dorm mates. It’s clear he hasn’t prioritised you as he should be, which is putting you as no1 priority. You’ve been together for two years so I would give him the benefit of the doubt he is merely comfortable in this relationship and is taking you for granted. Which is not ok but you’ll want to break that vail of comfortability around him before it makes you more sad and concerned. Especially when time is so important for you two. It sucks the limited time you have together between work 

And the thing is.. you are in nursing school.

Once you are finished and you become a nurse time is more limited to when you have now. If anything this time you have with him is the best time to be together the most before jobs make things worse. 

This isn’t being dramatic, this has been a slow burn that culminated from you being so used to each other for 2 years and it’s time his reminded that your time together like this is temporary like all things in life and it’s all going to get harder to find quality time later.

You are a couple, not room mates."
relationship_advice,femlu0o,t3_epz32o,1579261818.0," I don’t think this is a small deal as you claim. You too have a right to want the intimacy you want in a partner. If he doesn’t offer it because of his insecurities, it will only lead to the relationship ending eventually, like a snowball getting bigger and bigger the slope of your relationship gets steeper. Raise it to him you want that intimacy from him because it’s what you need to feel loved. If he can’t compromise that is his problem. You’ve already compromised enough by being so tolerate with him talking about his intimacy with his ex’s without thinking for one second how it affects you. Infact, telling him you want this intimacy is more reason that you aren’t like any of his ex’s, since he said he doesn’t want to be hurt like before... infact he shouldn’t have implied you are like them. If he can’t see the girl that loves him like you do, it’s really he isn’t ready for the relationship you deserve."
aww,fdt4ibw,t3_emymww,1578711813.0,“Did you just boop me?” Look was priceless
relationship_advice,fdjqc34,t1_fdjpkcv,1578483355.0,"The reason I didn’t pick up that you broken up over the friend bit is because she didn’t clearly break up with you by saying she just needed “space”.

The fact you miss her meant you are still not emotionally available for the other girls in your life.

As you know when you are emotionally involved with someone you expect them to put you first above everyone else. You haven’t done that with your two side girls as your primary focus is still on your main: your ex. You owe it to the other girls that you can’t continue this way because you still have unresolved feelings. 

A step forward to resolving your feelings for your ex is to realise the girl you fell in love with 2 years ago isn’t the same girl now."
relationship_advice,fdjpifk,t1_fdjp1f3,1578482285.0,I assume she is the one who broke up with you. What was her reason?
relationship_advice,fdjopka,t3_elr5ki,1578481199.0,"You’ve been busy within the last 3 months! It’s clear you haven’t reconciled your feelings for your ex and getting over an ex within 3 months after dating for 2 years is not something that can be resolved so quickly. 

What’s interesting is you mentioned that it ended badly, resolving the conflict that caused the break up is a step forward in reconciling the lingering feelings severed by it. How did it end badly?"
depression,fczrdaa,t3_ejn057,1578107317.0,"Where ever you look you see people get sucked and spit out by the world in unique ways. It’s like you are telling me life is unforgiving and everything around you shows little to no hope. And even when hope exists it’s tainted by the sins in which they got there with.

You are afraid to be another version of the people around you.

Fortunately the fact you feel afraid means you want to be a person excluding corruption, and to be happy without compromising.

Fortunately there are people who live the way you want to. You aren’t alone, there is no strings attached, we just need to put our head up and keep searching till we find people who we can be comfortable being ourselves with. And that in a world of sin we can live as pure and passionate as we want to be. 

Of course you need to first forgive yourself and the sins in the past, like what’s on your sisters bathroom, in order to move forward without the sins pulling you down and defining your every decision. 

It’s ok to be afraid and it’s ok to take a chance at falling over because the beauty of life is failure isn’t the end, it’s what we experience to get up and steer our direction to the life we truely want."
relationship_advice,fcz0a9i,t1_fcybiat,1578091041.0,"The thing is we keep the people in our lives we think we deserve. And you deserve better than this Sara. The fact you forgiven him for cheating shows how much you are willing to hang onto love. Which is love is something any guy would be lucky to have. It’s something to hold and protect. This is love that needs to be earned and never be compromised with. 

No one who treats you second like your ex deserves your love.

There is only so much time in lives to give it and its to be given to someone who will always treat you first 

Because the love you given to you ex makes you a strong partner, not weak.

So please no longer settle in being weak. And have respect in yourself that you are actually strong."

depression,fc2bljg,t3_e9lh6w,1577350533.0,"You aren’t a psychopath when you emotionally “pump and dump” before you go out into irl. It’s called venting to yourself and it’s good that you do. The only problem with that is you don’t get any feedback on resolving your emotional trauma I am really interested in understanding because once we understand your emotional buttons it’s one step closer in controlling them... and that’s what we want. We want control of ourselves when 99% in the world we can’t control.

Control can be given back to you Super and the more we known about your plight the closer we can be able to.

You mentioned your ex and I’m interested to know how you broken up. 

Thank you for opening up here."
depression,fc2be0w,t3_e6zvri,1577350187.0,"The people who love you irl are there ones who accept you for who you are. They are rare but it’s what makes them precious and make the hard parts of life bareable.

And you are right to feel like you want to plunk yourself in a world you can control because 99% of life is uncontrollable... which is why it’s so important for us to make the best decisions we make in our control. And we won’t get the right answer every time. Which is good because it means we can make a better decision when it really counts. 

You opening up here is a step towards the right direction because you deserve to be happy. A good listener like yourself is valuable and precious in a world where most people care to only listen to themselves and not to others. Let’s make a world for you in your utopia and in IRL because life is twice as fun if you can have the best of both worlds."
