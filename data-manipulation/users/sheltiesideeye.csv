AdvancedRunning,ff6cujo,t1_ff3rswx,1579624418.0,I'm thinking doing the half too and aiming for a PR. It would definitely be a soft PR (currently my Half PR is 1:39:27) so I'd probably be within a minute and a half of that. As much as I want to do the full (even slowly) the half would probably be a wiser option.
AdvancedRunning,ff6co6n,t1_ff3ny3j,1579624307.0,"Still trying to decide, as much as I want to do the full here I think going for a half PR may be my best option. I am injury free but don't want to risk too hard a workout (whether time on my feet or pace-wise) and having the full impacting my training the weeks afterwards."
AdvancedRunning,ff6b9s5,t1_ff3tx6b,1579623414.0,I'm between this and going for a half PR!
AdvancedRunning,ff6b618,t1_ff48qm1,1579623348.0,Decided against option 1 for sure and am highly considering aiming for a half PR. I don't want to risk forcing too hard of a workout and not being able to train well the weeks afterwards or injuring myself.
AdvancedRunning,ff6a6wi,t1_ff3po9f,1579622724.0,Thanks! Enough of y'all have talked me out of Option 1 so I'm not going to do that. Yeah I'm highly considering doing the half as a tune up race at this point. A PR is feasible and I'd still be able to continue with my full volume of training for the remaining 7 weeks.
AdvancedRunning,ff3e3g2,t3_erdxly,1579539230.0,"13 weeks out from Boston, and I'm feeling good! My training went well last week. Got my short and mid-length runs in and did a good hill workout Saturday (that I will definitely use throughout the next several weeks) followed by a 17 mile long run yesterday.  Today I'm off and this is a drop down week so I may try to hit the gym and do some arms/core work on a couple of my low mileage days."
AdvancedRunning,feyzicy,t3_eqogmy,1579452407.0,"I have a couple huge scars on my knees from falling over the past couple years (nothing too deep, mainly superficial but they cover a lot of my kneecap) due to not picking my feet up or not paying attention as well as I should. I think trying to make yourself more self aware especially when you're running on an uneven surface would help, though easier said than done. Maybe try setting an alarm on your phone to buzz every few minutes to focus back, or try running without music (if you run with it). I don't have much else in the way of advice but I feel you on the clumsiness."
fatlogic,feyxc7x,t3_eqvdn9,1579451577.0,"You know what, BMI is inaccurate. In fact, it [underestimates body fat and obesity prevalence](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/bmi-underestimates-prevalence-obesity/story?id=10521712). We should go by body fat % instead."
fatlogic,feywa2n,t1_feyaghs,1579451258.0,I run marathons and average 30-50mpw during my training periods. I still have to watch what I eat. It really only ups my TDEE on average about 200-400 cal/day.
fatlogic,feyvte2,t1_fey0ea8,1579451045.0,"I'd get if it was ~200-300 cal, on a similar level to overreporting their TDEE. Small bites and undercounted things add up. Its mind blowing that you can be counting and underreporting by 1000kcal though. Like do they not know how to read nutrition labels? Or is it just rough estimates?"
AdvancedRunning,fengyx0,t3_eq3qa5,1579284472.0,"My 10k PR is within 45 seconds of yours, and I've run three marathons between 3:24 and 3:31. Your training paces are pretty consistent with what I do (and with what training calculators suggest). How many MPW are you planning on averaging and peaking at?"
AdvancedRunning,fen99l1,t3_eq1v91,1579279750.0,"Fruit snacks/gummies depending on the brand are mainly just carbs. If you want a more ""natural"" option Id say fruit juices and fruits are the best way to go."
AdvancedRunning,fen8gw3,t3_eq144p,1579279265.0,"I live in the southeast US and have been spoiled with nice winter weather and running conditions (low-moderate humidity, temps in the 50s- 60s, partly cloudy) for a significant part of the past couple months. But I'm running Boston in April and know I need to get my ass outside and train in some less than ideal conditions. For the next two weeks theres going to be a lot of temps that drop down to the mid 20s, or rainy conditions in the 40s and 50s. I have access to a gym with an indoor track so it gets tough to run outside in crappy weather when I can choose indoor but I need to commit and force myself to get uncomfortable."
