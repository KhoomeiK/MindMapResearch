Just got 8lbs of N110 that I'll be working up for accurate loads on 110 and 125gr supers.  It's generates lower FPS than H110/296, but is accurate and consistent.

Also, do you handload?  This is an amazing caliber if you handload.

A 16 inch barrel is not useless if you want to hunt deer-sized game to 250 yards.  If you want to hunt less than 200 yards and maybe get into suppressed subsonics, get a 10 to 12 inch barrel.  If you want a PDW for 100 yards and in that will always wear a suppressor, get a 7 to 9 inch fast twist barrel.

If I were starting today vs 2011 (I jumped in head first in 2011) and wanted to give yourself options down the road, I'd get a pistol brace lower with a decent trigger, 10 to 12 inch barrel (carbine gas if you handload, pistol gas if you don't), a quality BCG, and free float handguard.

worldnews,fdej0jd,t3_ekvgta,1578340055.0,"Trump is a moron, but why are people buying the ""Iran as the victim here"" card?

Iran's General responsible for their foreign paramilitary endeavours was with an Iran-financed militia operating in Iraq - Kataib Hezbollah.  The same group that stormed the US Embassy in Baghdad a few day earlier.  And the same militia that is a recognized combatant in Iraq.  This is clearly proof to any Iran-deniers of Iran's direct involvement with recent events in Iraq.

However, Trump my be such an inept orator that what actually may have happened is the US was targeting al-Muhandis, the leader of Kataib Hezbollah, and Soleimani may have been with them coincidentally - which green-lit the strike.  But in any case, Trump is acting like that was the plan all along to sound like a bad ass and it's very antagonistic to an emotionally charged regime.

Trump's play is high risk and potential high reward.  The risk is greater if we buy into the ""Iran as the victim"" narrative.

""Iran only did (what they do next, if they do it) because Trump killed a general!""  Let's not forget who that general was with and when he was with them."

I shipped the rifle and heard back from AAC 4 days later with a diagnosis. I had the fixed rifle back in my hands 4 days after that.  Never an issue since.  Excellent customer service.  The only better CS I've ever had in any experience is with St Croix fishing rods.

Fast forward to Q.  I own two Q pistols and suppressor.  I've never had an issue with any of their products.  I have emailed a few questions to the service/sales dept and response have been quick.
