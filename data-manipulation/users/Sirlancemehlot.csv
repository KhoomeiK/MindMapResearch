He also was an anti-mob lawyer (how he made his fame).  He swept the mafia out of the Fulton Fish Market, got rid of the porn, hookers and squeegee people on 42nd st. and instituted the ""Broken Windows"" policy which helped turn some of the grimiest, most dangerous areas of NYC into centers of tourism.  5th ave and the Theater district are like grand shopping malls, now.

I take her by the hand and tell her to pick out a CD (the prizes were CD's obviously).  She played along and picked out a Jane's Addiction CD and I put my money down on a 1/100 game of chance and boom.  Winner.  ""Jane's Addiction, please.""  Coolest fucking moment of my dating life.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fehtp2t,t1_fefjkts,1579123666.0,"I'm sorry my friend but your response is dishonest.  I never said the ones who turn away are not at fault.  I said an officer that lives three states away shouldn't be judged by this bad egg.  That's what I said.  No mention of cover-up whatsoever.  Don't make up arguments to argue against.  Reply to what I said, nothing more."
iamatotalpieceofshit,feexrc1,t1_fe6828w,1579043526.0,Hmmm. So you believe in judging entire groups by the acts of a few individuals. Seems a bit dangerous when applied to other groups. No?

iamatotalpieceofshit,fe68f7l,t1_fe67utf,1578884057.0,It wasn't even the union. It was a BS technicality. His lawyer got him off because they couldn't pin down the exact date and there's a 180 day window to charge him. Hes suspended again though. And his coworkers obviously don't like or trust him.

AskReddit,fdiftay,t1_fdia38e,1578441934.0,You obviously haven't read my other posts but cherry picked one that suited your agenda. I've said it ad nauseam. Reddit hates nuance and middle gray.
AskReddit,fdi8w22,t1_fdf9oq0,1578437838.0,No not good vs bad. Sometimes the cop is the asshole. Sometimes the driver is. Sometimes they're both decent people. That's the point. You want cops to stop a drunk driving the wrong way down a highway. And that cop probably wants to know why that idiot is driving the wrong way and putting lives in danger. Sometimes a person isn't doing anything wrong on purpose. So they may have a legit reason for the mistake. It's not that complicated

Cops want to get through their 10 to 12 hour shifts with as little hassle as possible.

Cops want to write a few tickets a shift to keep the supervisors off their backs.

Cops can't wait for their shift meal.  Something decent but not overly expensive. 

Cops like coffee.

Cops would prefer to get through their shifts without seeing any dead people or people mourning dead people.

Cops don't like it when bullshit them. But everyone pretty much takes a crack it.

Cops don't love you or hate you. You're just another part of the job they'd like to get through with as little hassle as possible. 

All the rest is overblown nonsense."

AskReddit,fdhu1xr,t1_fdf06ji,1578430150.0,Cops. As if they aren't people. If you have any common sense whatsoever you'll know what type of person you're dealing with in the first ten seconds.

I can't tell you how many times I've nearly been run over on a traffic post with signage, cones, flashing lights, etc.  Or how many dead or dying people I've witnessed in horrible accidents. It's just human nature on those outrageous incidents to ask, ""do you know what you just did?""

AskReddit,fdf8mk9,t1_fdf5kvh,1578355852.0,So dangerous drivers nearly causing accidents and completely unaware of their offenses are the GOOD guys.

I think I know what I'm talking about.  I've pulled over literally thousands of cars.  Maybe 1 in 3 stops resulted in a ticket and not once did an admission of guilt play any part in that decision.  The things that really count?  Lying, bad driving record, dangerous operation, repeat offender, school zone infractions...these are more likely to get you written.  ""I think I might have been speeding, officer"" is not getting you a ticket.  You've been pulled over because he KNOWS you were speeding and clocked you on radar.  Or he has you on dashcam (they go back 30 seconds once lights are activated) committing an offense.  You're so much better off talking your way out of a ticket than stonewalling and lying.  The officers I work with will often say, ""yeah he wrote himself that ticket"" meaning they weren't planning on a summons, but the driver was such an asshole that they relinquished any right to courtesy."
AskReddit,fdf7cqx,t1_fdea1q8,1578355000.0,"FFS this is like the tenth time I've read this drivel.  If you were speeding they CLOCKED YOU SPEEDING.  If you ran a red, they put on their lights to pull you over and the dashcam immediately goes back 30 seconds and records the infraction.  Police are trained and paid to know and enforce traffic laws and they've heard every excuse, seen every scenario and already have probable cause for a summons if they pulled you over.  period.  End of story.  What you say or don't say about it means nothing.  Admit you fucked up and say sorry--you might get a little sympathy and a warning.

AskReddit,fdf6l0s,t1_fdec0ls,1578354482.0,"lol.  If they pulled you over they already have probable cause.  Police do traffic enforcement for a living.  If you got pulled over, they caught you doing something contrary to traffic laws.  Whether you admit it, don't admit it, or sing a Neil Diamond medley, it makes no difference.  Be honest and respectful, just like you would with any other stranger you happen across, and chances are good you'll be more likely to have a positive outcome."

Generally I wouldn't ask such a question and never would I lecture and give ticket...it was either/or.  But on occasion you'd see someone blow a stop sign or fail to signal during a merge and you honestly would like to know if they were aware of what they did.  An honest answer like, ""I'm not from around here and didn't see the sign until it was too late.""  No ticket.  Just be careful next time.  ""There was a merge?""  yes, and you didn't signal causing another car to swerve onto the shoulder.  Ticket for nearly causing an accident by not paying attention.  See, there are actually reasons for determining if someone was aware of their offense."
