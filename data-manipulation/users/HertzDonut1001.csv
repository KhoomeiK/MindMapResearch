Political_Revolution,ffhk3dw,t1_ffgg04d,1579938909.0,"Medicare for all and other universal health plans will cost you less. Remember, it's the fact that health prices are jacked up by insurance companies and all out of pocket costs in addition to the price to have a plan in the first place if your employer does not provide one. Make private insurance obsolete and costs will go down for everyone. Many first World countries do this, the data is all there to back it up. Look at Canada or the NHS in the UK, or the Scandinavian model for democratic socialism."

unpopularopinion,ffhh0m3,t1_ffhckn4,1579934864.0,"Actually i drive for a living and use Google maps because speed is important and it takes slightly longer to pull out my physical map. It will tell you the shortest route, not the fastest. It also gives bad directions sometimes. A map doesn't lie and you can see all the different ways from start to destination and choose the fastest.


Edit: point being, if I had to choose one, definitely physical. I trust city hall more than Google when it comes to a map of the city, especially because they're quickly updated. Yes, Google is fast, but not as fast. With both, I'd definitely prefer using a GPS system for ease but if you dont have backup map-reading skills and a map you'll eventually be led astray. Hell, sometimes I'll use Google as a quick physical map and always used to instead of the GPS directions. ""Oh, wrong part of the grid? Must be the next 100th Ave across the lake"" or whatever."
