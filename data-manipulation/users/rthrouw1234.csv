Go online and look for a free pdf of a book called *Why Does He Do That?* - that book will absolutely tell you what red flags to look for. Also, a book called *The Gift of Fear* by Gavin de Becker."

relationships,ffpigkg,t3_eui0de,1580095822.0,"I'm not sure i would describe all this as abusive just yet, but he's absolutely a completely oblivious dumbass, selfish, and kind of a coward. You've handled all these situations really well, particularly in the last conversation. That incident in particular shows a sense of entitlement in him.

 So i guess I would come down on the side of him being stupid? But that doesn't mean his behavior is any less damaging.  I think you should seriously weigh the pros and cons of continuing to date him.

A final point: if someone does something really shitty and abusive, it absolutely *does not matter* if they did it on purpose or because they were stupid/naive. Either way, that's a person you should avoid."

Your mother may not be capable of understanding why she behaved like that, or giving you any kind of answer or closure to the entire situation (in fact, she probably won't be able to explain her decisions - much like my enabling mother wasn't able to explain why she stayed with my abusive, alcoholic father).
