bipolar,fcc0sl5,t3_djgrcj,1577593124.0,I am living in MI with my LMSW which is clinical but I plan to move to AZ hopefully to start over. A lot of my worries include whether or no AZ will take my bipolar disorder and decide that enough time has not passed for me to be considered stable. I have had a lot of struggles and hurdles to get this far in my education and career. Right now I am on a mental health break and receiving disability for my bipolar. I would like to return to work which is why I want to have my license in AZ too. We could stay in MI and just move to another location but I want away from the snow.... and my parents.
bipolar,fcbywad,t1_f4572zg,1577592510.0,"I am not currently practicing but I have my LMSW (clinical) for MI. I am contemplating a move to AZ. Filling out the application, I have to state why I resigned my position in lieu of being terminated as I was manic and having a breakdown. Then I had to explain my mental health for the past five years. I had the breakdown 3 years ago. I have been on disability since August 2018. I plan to go back to work of we move to AZ."
