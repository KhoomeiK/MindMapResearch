This was during Siamese Dream or right before MCIS.

Then there is concept album Machina that one could do a video essay about explaining it because Billy had been using character's name throughout other albums and threw them in that album to connect pieces together. It was gonna be a double album but the record company stopped that. The story is about as subtle as a brick to the face but the album is good.

The final show at the Metro won't be released anytime soon either despite clips of it coming out. Apparently, there is bad blood between the venue owner and Billy."
