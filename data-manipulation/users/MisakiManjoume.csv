ask,ffeq112,t3_et84jn,1579859743.0,"I am from Poland. Here, the word ""make"" is used in the context of literally making something, like ""I made dinner"" or ""I""m making a salad"". In the term of tests, we never use any of the vatiations English language like take etc. We pretty much only say ""I wrote a test"", ""I'm writing a test tommorow"". I hope that's the answer. Not sure about other countries."

offmychest,fenuwgk,t1_fenug7z,1579291202.0,"I hope so. It makes human interactions only more difficult. I want to say something and suddenly bam, I can't spit a single word out of my mouth, like something paralised me. I hate it."
offmychest,fenuqm3,t1_femzwq4,1579291115.0,"Thank you, that means a lot. I appreciate your advice. I mostly want to focus on the diet thing, because I either eat junk or not eat at all. I also have a problem with dehydrating myself, although I don't know if it's related. Probably. I just don't even have the energy to drink. It's like my urge to do that turned off. If I drink, it's mostly juice or cola. And I think rather then iron, it can be the fact that I tend to have magnesium deficiency (I've experienced symptoms many times, but never really get that checked out)."
offmychest,fenu21k,t1_fen5gcg,1579290707.0,"Maybe? I mean, he told me many times that this therapy is for me and there's nothing I should be afraid of, but I just have this natural block when it comes to certain topics, even if so many people explain me I can talk with them about anything. It's really annoying."
offmychest,femzj2s,t1_femx5gp,1579273571.0,"Thank you. And don't worry, my therapist is really great. I guess I just put it into wrong words. I can talk freely about pretty much everything, I just can't actually harm myself or try to take my own life. He really helps me, that's why I don't know how to explained I lied. I am always scared of people's reaction, even though my therapist explained that he will never say nor do anything that would make me uncomfortable and his therapy room should feel like a safe space for me."

offmychest,fe8p1lh,t3_enrwa2,1578928763.0,"Kind of? I mean, I treasure all friends and family members, I just don't give a shit about myself and I think I'm a waste of time, lol."
