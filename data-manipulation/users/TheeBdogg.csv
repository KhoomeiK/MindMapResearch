WritingPrompts,feiraie,t3_epc8y5,1579145227.0,"""Who are you?"" He asks desperately struggling against my power. The man they call hope hangs helplessly in midair as I hold him still. A crowd begins to gather as cars are stopped forming a circle around me and the man who ruined my life. That should have stung but I knew he didn't remember me. Why would he remember someone whom he almost killed, someone who's life he destroyed. For if he did he wouldn't be The Marvelous Maroo. The man who can run faster than that of a racehorse, soar to the highest of heights imaginable, and bend steel with his bare hands. My moment has come for me to show the world exactly who he is. A heartless, selfish, fraud. I squeeze upon his body with fifteen years of anger welling up inside of me. He screams. I release him from the squeeze. He stares at me with the most desperate look in his eyes, realizing his fate is in my hands. ""Why would you know me?"" I say. I don't care if he knows who am because vengeance is mine. 

I steady my mind to make him explode. ""Henry"" a sweet voice whispers in my head. My focus starts to slip but I still maintain enough to keep him in the air. ""Sweety, It's okay."" I lose focus and he drops to the ground. My mind becomes consumed with a memory. ""But Mom..."" I say. ""Son, We do not respond with Vengeance."" My Dad commands appearing in the image. ""Cowards and fools harm those who know not what they do."" My mom grabs my hand. She smiles at me and my heart flutters. ""Baby, be strong, don't be like the boy who wronged you."" My Dad looks at me with a smile too. ""It's okay, let it go."" and the scene whisks away to the New York street at which moments ago I held The Marvelous Maroo in the air. 

He now sits on the street in the middle of a crater in the pavement, with a look of fear in his eyes I've never seen before. The crowd looks on in silence as I regain control of him once more. I bring up close to me. I hold him there for a moment to absorb his fear. ""You killed my parents and took my arms when you crashed into the Brooklyn bridge 15 years ago."" biting my lip in anger as I struggle to  control my urge to kill him. His face turns to shock as the memory returns to him. ""I do not want an apology""I say as his lips attempt to form words. Although, i would not accept his apology, I more so do not wish to hear him speak. ""I want you to remember me. I want to you to remember how close I came to killing you."" I squeeze him just enough to make him wince in pain. ""I want you to remember how close you came to death."" I squeeze him once more, receiving another wince in response. ""Never try to be the hero you and I know both know you are not."" I squeeze him one last time. ""This is the end of The Marvelous Maroo because if another person dies because of you, next time I will not spare you."" I slam him to the ground, and turn, walking away. I motion to the crowd to part as I begin my ascent into the sky away from the man who ruined my life."

AdvancedRunning,fe02lmj,t3_enelz4,1578801503.0,"I've been dealing with almost the exacts same thing. I've spent the last 4 years emotionally damaging myself because I didn't reach my goals. My senior year of high school I lost my varsity spot right before sectionals to a freshman by 3 seconds. It destroyed me and I don't think I've fully recovered because of it. I might be getting better though. I ran probably the best race of my life, an 800 which I don't normally train for, in which I went out faster than I planned and just held on until I ran a time I couldn't even fathom. I kept my goal simple so I wouldn't overthink it.
Runnings hard. Running competively will beat the piss out of you because you'll always have people next you and in front of you to make you think you're not good enough. You got to find a way to run for something more than that. I don't know if it's going to work yet because its my first time legitimately trying this but I run because my team needs me. People leave and quit and leave coaches hanging. I don't want to be that guy. One quote I use was from cool runnings "" a gold medal is a wonderful thing. But if you're not good enough without it, you'll never be enough with it."" Your goals will move. And you'll fail, time and again. If you hang the reason why you run on your goals, you'll never be a happy runner. You need to find your why."
