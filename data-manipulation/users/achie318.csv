WeightLossAdvice,fftko4y,t1_fftk8j8,1580223030.0,Thank you! I’ve since dropped the weight and am fairly healthy (emotionally and physically) but will never forget his impact on my life.
WeightLossAdvice,fftcovu,t3_euruso,1580216573.0,"I went to a therapist about 9-10 years ago for my first appointment. I was depressed after the suicide of my brother which led me to overeat and gain about 80 lbs. I was reaching out for help. He almost berated me for my weight and told me it was contributing to my depression. He asked if I used sugar and creamer in my coffee and told me how it was a bunch of empty calories, blah blah blah. He made me feel worthless and weak. It’s still stuck with me all these years later. I never went to see him again and still think of him every time I walk by creamer in a grocery store, or hear someone order a mocha frappe or the like, and I still drink my coffee black because of him. Words hurt. A lot. 


So drink all the creamer and sugar you want, and do it for me, as well as yourself."

confessions,ffcvqxx,t3_esu0g4,1579808271.0,"I really enjoyed reading your words. I HATE racism. I’m white, and growing up my stepdad was Pacific Islander and so was my half sister. I saw her as my baby sister and nothing else. He constantly brought up race as an issue. If we got into fights as kids it was cause she was “different” and I was punished. There are more instances than I can even mention that are ingrained in me. It’s made me almost over-sensitive to racial differences. I’m almost obsessed with not offending others or treating them any “differently” if they aren’t the same skin color as me. My point is - we all bleed red, feel pain, shed tears, and need love and compassion. We are all human and a product of how we’re raised, not what color we are, and I wish more people saw it that way. I’m sorry for your experiences growing up but I’m glad you didn’t let it harden your heart against those different than you. Hugs, OP. Life is hard! No matter the skin color you’re born with."
confessions,ffbu0ue,t3_eskb8v,1579782707.0,"You really should feel proud and good about yourself, as others have said, because you offered this man peace and comfort when he had no one and nothing else. It doesn’t matter that you don’t believe. You didn’t betray anyone, not even yourself. Huugs OP. I cannot imagine what you go through and see on the daily. Take comfort and peace in the small things. And thank you for all you do!"

So happy her family fought for her and won! and this sicko is now sitting in a cell, hopefully with people he helped put there. This world turns my head at times!"
