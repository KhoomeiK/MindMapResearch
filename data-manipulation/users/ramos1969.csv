guitarlessons,femtaf1,t3_epuyut,1579268988.0,"Your fingerboard has a slight arch, called the neck radius.  Look up the specs of your guitar and find out what you’re neck radius is.  10” is pretty common.  Your bridge saddles should match that same neck radius.  

There are gauges that help measure it, but generally the two strings in the middle (D and G) should sit ever-so-slightly higher than the first and second strings and the fifth and sixth strings, such that they form a slight arch at the bridge saddles.

You can eyeball it without the gauges.  Use a small Allen wrench to raise the two middle strings just a hair above the rest.

Fret buzz can be an indication that a saddle could be too low.   If your saddles looks proper and you still have fret buzz, check your truss rod.

Fret buzz could also be a wonky fret or an improperly cut nut slot."

UnresolvedMysteries,fcnqrs1,t1_fcnhoh4,1577816669.0,"I thought the same as you until I was falsely accused of something serious.  I had as part of my resource group my girlfriend (attorney), brother (police officer), good friend (deputy) who all said “NO, DO NOT TALK TO THEM”.  I called a local defense attorney and he agreed wholeheartedly.  He spent an hour on the phone with me, followed up with a letter, all for free, making sure I don’t speak with anyone.

I was under the naive assumption that since I was innocent I had nothing to hide, but I was convinced that’s not the case.  The police aren’t trying to ‘solve’ the case.  They’re trying to put together a case that can be taken to court by a prosecutor with a reasonable chance of winning.  Therefore, anything I could say to them (even if I think I’m clearing my name) is ammunition for them to build a case.  For example, if I say “I didn’t do it.  That’s not the kind of behavior I engage in.”   The officer could write down “suspect became very defensive and argumentative”.   You’re better off getting an attorney immediately and having all questions routed through them.

Also, the defense attorney said that speaking with LE only makes the attorneys job harder if charges are brought.  Harder for the defense, and more expensive for me.  Nothing good comes from speaking with them or consenting to a search.

There’s a chance that an officer may take your answers and decide it’s not worth pursuing, but I’m not willing to take that chance."
