I don’t have a problem with QBs getting paid because of how important there position is on the team. However the more they make seriously impacts who the can sign or resign. He could take 5 million a year and between that and endorsements he’d be set for life. But he is greedy like we all are. If I was in his position I’d want to get paid as much as possible as well."

Maher,ffijq00,t1_ffhoktd,1579975506.0,"Well said. It raises an interesting question about politics in general regarding politicians and their stances on things and if they’ve revised their opinion for whatever reason. Thinking about past or present issues like drug legality, abortion, healthcare, civil rights, gay marriage etc.

I think by and large we want people who stick to their convictions who are consistent. However, it’s also not good for someone to stubbornly adhere to their beliefs when theirs a culture shift or research that tells you otherwise.

When is flip flopping good vs bad? The most recent ones I can think of is Hillary being ok with gay marriage fairly recently, I believe 2012.

The other one is Biden being anti weed despite mounting evidence it’s not a gateway drug, as well as a clear culture shift.
