SuicideWatch,ffo372y,t1_ffo273u,1580073608.0,"No. I honestly don't care if people believe me or not or if they take what I'm saying seriously. If it's not a true ""problem"" people tend to just drop it. It's the future, not present. So it doesn't matter."
SuicideWatch,ffo1lhr,t1_ffo0hqh,1580073216.0,"Because right now I don't want to live. I want get to 18 and end it. Alot of people say that too. They say they aren't going make it or they can't see themselves getting passed a certain age but they end up being ok. I don't want that to be me aswell. I see no enjoyment in being alive and hearing stories like that make me upset because I hate knowing I have a chance of being ""ok"" when I don't want to be. I want to be dead."
SuicideWatch,ffnxeha,t3_euci6s,1580071984.0,"No I trust my therapist, she just has to tell my parents if I plan on hurting myself. And I don't want them to know about it."
SuicideWatch,fcqr6nb,t1_fcqq8lg,1577890922.0,"Yeah, being able to relate to someone is comforting."
