Do it yourself with Vanguard, Fidelity or Schwab. You've already done the ""managing"" by deciding which funds you want (excellent choices!). Once a year you can check it. 

Learn to manage your own money now. It will payoff in the next 70 years when you know what is happening with investments, income, dividends, etc. and you aren't taking advice from someone who wants a piece of you."

Put your money in an index fund and leave it alone. Keep it in the Roth, otherwise you will pay a 10% penalty and be taxed on the gains (in the year you take it out). Even with a ""crash"" you are better off keeping our money invested in the total stock market because you have 50 years to recover."

Do not apologize. He's a jerk."

You will need to save up at least $1000 and buy a beater. Any car with a loan will require full coverage for insurance and that could easily be more than $200 a month for someone your age."
personalfinance,fejddpf,t3_epgek3,1579168498.0,"The only point of having money in the bank is if some emergency comes up you have extra $$ to cover it. If you have paid everything towards your loan and an emergency comes up you can't take money out of your loan to cover the emergency.

Savings accounts aren't there to increase your wealth, they are collection buckets.

Emergencies could include dental or medical expenses, you break a leg and can't work for awhile, car need repairs, laptop needs replacing, etc."
