To calculate this number you, and various media outlets, are taking the number of fatalities and dividing it by the number of total cases.  Makes sense, until you remember that people don't get diagnosed and then immediately keel over dead. Most of them probably don't die for a week or more which means there's a significant time lag between the number of cases and the number of fatalities.  It would probably be more accurate to divide current fatalities by last week's number of infections but honestly we can't know for sure.  

Once the spreading of the virus over, you can wait a few weeks to see how many more deaths happen with those still infected to get an actual number. However at present, people are estimating that that final number will likely be around 5-10%. 

To put this more succinctly: How many of those 8k are still in the hospital?  How of those will die rather than recover?  That number needs to be added into the current fatality count before you can get a real fatality rate."

I don't just mean the two free ""audible originals"" you can choose per month (many of which are legit books) without using a credit--but rather all the free books they give promotionally.  

Audible has frequent deals to sign up and get 1-3 free credits before you pay for your first month.  You can cancel and take advantage of such deals once per year.  Over the years I have received at least 20 Audiobooks either for free or at a substantially discounted rate (first 3 months for $1.95 a month).  These sorts of promotions drive up the cost but are probably necessary to draw in new users.


Also worth noting is that Netflix prices have spiked since Netflix started producing content.  Audible has been producing content since the start.  A huge portion of their catalog, especially in sci-fi and fantasy, are books that would not otherwise have has an audiobook version made.  


To that end, Audible has made it possible to enjoy many audiobooks that would not otherwise exist.  But the flip side of that is they would not have existed because they only have niche appeal.  If you want a niche product, you have to expect to pay higher prices. 

So if you are only using audible to obtain bestsellers, then you're right, the price is probably inflated from what you should be paying.  But I honestly think most people are going to audible because of their extensive catalog of titles that only exist because they produce them in the first place.  There's a staggering amount of audible titles they're actually self-published authors who have been successful in the Kindle market but otherwise have no book deal with any publisher.   That's pretty cool, if you ask me.

That would be true if we were talking about the flu.  People who don't go to the hospital are never really counted.   SARS was very different, however.  Because it was novel and high-profile, some full scale epidemiology was done. You can bet every single one of those 8k people were interviewed.  Everyone they came in contact with was similarly checked out by a doctor and possibly every subjected to quarantine procedures just in case.  

In this particular situation, we can expect that those 8k people represent a vast majority of the actual cases. 

> The flu is also airborne and so far, it looks like the Wuhan virus is far less contagious and require close contacts

So ""far less contagious"" is a very premature statement. However, I think the most concerning aspect of this virus is it's two week incubation period coupled with the fact that if appears that you become contagious during that incubation period wherein you are asymptomatic.  That's something in particular that makes this more worrisome. 


Also, all these comparisons to the flu are not  favorable to your argument.  The flu is serious business, but at least we have vaccines for it **and** most of the most vulnerable populations recieve that vaccine (the very young and very old).   Not to mention that because the flu is not novel, any given version of it is likely to be similar enough to an older version such that at least some people will have some immunity. 

Panic is bad, but we should definitely take this seriously.  If we do, odds are we can contain it or slow it down long enough to have a vaccine.  The worst case scenarios are not the most likely by any means, but we should not be casually dismissing this by saying ""it's no worse than the flu"".  That sort of thinking leads to inaction and even the flu requires constant action on our part to keep a pandemic like the Spanish flu from happening again."

> In the EU, over 91,000 salmonellosis cases are **reported** each year

See?  You're looking at two totally different metrics. One is trying to include unreported cases and one is not.    

It's hard to get comparable data but per Wikipedia, up to 80% of cases go unreported so if we take the CDC's number and divide by 4 that number might correspond better to the European number but it's hard to say (again, the CDC tends to bias towards ""worst case scenario"" when selecting numbers for public consumption).  

Beyond that, there's another huge factor: **Americans eat six times as much chicken than Europeans(20Kg vs 120kg).  That means if all cases of Salmonella came from chicken, we would expect Americans to get it six times more often even if American chicken was just as safe as European chicken.**

Now of course, they're also cases from eggs and also the pet trade (turtles).  So to be more accurate would be quite difficult. Although, I suspect there's a lot fewer pet turtles in Europe than in the US.

At any rate, when you look at the whole picture, I don't actually think there's any strong evidence that suggests that European chicken is at all safer than American chicken. That said, American chicken is super cheap. If Europe starts importing chicken from the United States, their chicken consumption will almost certainly go up.  Higher consumption will lead to increased risk exposure to salmonella and almost certainly mean more cases.

changemyview,ffcnavr,t1_ffchkqq,1579803090.0,"You seem to be dismissing out of hand hard proof simply because it only applies to a handful of families.  So let's some quick napkin math.  I'm gonna round some numbers to make this simple.  There's about 850 million acres worth of family farms in the United States.   Obviously that's probably more land that was in Use prior to the civil war (particularly anything on the west coast) so let's conservatively estimate that about a quarter of that has been in family hands since the Civil War era.  That's about 1 acre of farm land per white person in the US. I'm gonna low-ball that and call it 3,000 dollars worth of wealth per white person or about 2% of the current wealth gap. 


That's how much of the wealth gap comes  from farm land passed down from generation to generation.  It says nothing about other wealth.   The fact is, money begets money.  All the white wealth at the end of the civil war didn't just evaporate.  It becomes harder to track when it's not a single thing like a farm that's stayed in the family for 200 years, but if you sold the farm 100 years ago because someone wanted to build houses on it and used the money to start a business or whatever that's still the same wealth and in most cases it's passed on.   Sure, there may be cases where someone dies penniless because of bad investments or spends every cent before they die, but most families can look back at their previous five generations and see that all of them left something behind to the next generation when they died.  

The farm land wealth 2% is just a fraction of the full percent of the gap **directly** attributable to slavery.

> The vast majority of white familes POST-Civil War were as dirt poor as the newly freed slaves.

Hardly.   First of all, this only applies in the south--and in fact, white poverty is far more common in the south than elsewhere.  Secondly,  they lost a lot of wealth in the form of slaves--the slaves themselves were wealth.  There was also a decent amount of property destruction.  But even for those who's houses were burned by Sherman and who lost all their slaves, they still had significant assets in the form of land.   So even though the generational impact of the was still affects plenty of white people in the south, it's not anywhere close to fair to say that whites in the south were just as poorly off. 

> Why are so few white families living in poverty compared to black families today? (There's a SUPER simple answer and it's not racism...)

Racism is a huge factor.  There was a huge lack of opportunity for black people for most of the last 150 years.  In the south, slavery was effectively re-instituted almost immediately in the form of prison labor.  Because the 13th ammendment explicitly allows forced labor in the case of prisoners, prisons quickly began rent prisoners out to fill the labor gap left by slaves.  This created demand for new prisoners and that's partly how Jim Crow emerged.  

Vagrancy, not having a job, was made illegal in many places and black people not already working as share croppers would be arrested as ""vagrants"", put in prison, then forced into farm labor as prisoners.  This shit went on for another 40 years after slavery officially ended before anyone put a stop to it.   When the alternative to working is to be arrested for not working and forced to work, you don't have to pay fair wages.  Accordingly, black people stayed poor. 

Segregation ensured that black students went to lower quality schools.  It's hard to get a good job without a proper education.  For those who wanted to start their own businesses, there was nobody willing to lend to black people.  And then there was redlining, which prevented black people from obtaining mortgages to live in white neighborhoods and ensured they would never see an increase in their property values the way white families have enjoyed for decades. The list goes on and on. 

White people had huge advantages in the form of education, assets, and access to capital.  There are numerous ways in which black people were clearly disadvantaged until as recently as the 1980's.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying racism ended 40 years ago, but from that point on its impact becomes less overt and harder to prove.    But up until that point', we're talking about racism enshrined in law on the public record that simply and clearly gave black people a disadvantage. 

**All of that aside**, I do believe there is a component that is not directly about racism or slavery.  There are cultural problems in the black community.  BLack immigrants and their children earn more money and generally do better in life than the black families who trace their ancestry to slavery.  Even black Caribbean immigrants *can* trace their ancestry to slaves (in the Caribbean) do better and earn more money. 

So clearly the problem isn't intrinsic to blackness, but something that has happened to slaves and their ancestors in the United States that has been passed down from generation to generation. 


The problem is, these cultural problems are often held up by some people (i'm guessing you are one of them from your tone) as evidence that black people need to ""do better"" and are failing to take advantage of the opportunities they do have.  They pretend that this somehow means racism and slavery aren't the problem when its clear that racism and slavery are the underlying cause of these problems too.  Slavery and racism have been corrosive to black culture.  We learn values from our parents.  Slaves were torn from their parents.  When they have kids of their own, even if they aren't separated, how can they teach what they don't know?  Who can model smart financial sense if they've never had a dollar in their life? 

Its unreasonable to pretend that slavery and racism aren't directly at the root of this too. These sorts of cultural wounds aren't going to heal themselves in a single generation."
changemyview,ffc7fwy,t3_eskh9c,1579793281.0,"Let me turn this around on you.  Are there any white people alive currently who owe any part of their current wealth to family money over 250 years old?

There's basically no taxes on inheritances and estates less than 11 million dollars.  Is there even one family out there living on land they inherited from their parents who inherited it from their grand parents and so fourth for another 2-3 generations?

Let's narrow this down for simplicity.  Think farmers.  **Is there a single farmer in the US making money by farming the same land their great, great, great grandparents did?**

Let's imagine a modest 200 acre family farm that has been in the family for at least 5 generations.  That farm is worth at least $1 million dollars (possibly double that, depending on how desirable the land itself is).  That's just the value of the land, not the structures which may have been added more recently.  That's an example of white wealth carried over from the slavery era (possibly before).




I submit to you this very simple argument.  The fact that at least some white family's clearly have some wealth from prior to the civil war, while no black families have any is *prima facie* proof that at least **some** of the wealth gap is attributable to slavery and the fact that white families were able to build wealth during the slavery era while black families could not.   I'm not even sure how it's even a little bit possible to deny that at some measurable fraction, at the very least, of the gap exists directly from slavery. 

To believe otherwise you would have to believe that no single example like the one I described exists and I simply don't see how you possibly can. 


Now, some white families obviously are more recent immigrants and do not have the benefit of ancestral wealth, but we are speaking in averages here and some **clearly do.**.   To go beyond this we could talk about how wealth multiplies itself (keep in mind this farm we described has provided a living income for over 150 years while simultaneously going up in value.  The total wealth of has provided far exceeds its current value.  Or we can talk about financial and employment discrimination post slavery that provably still existed well into the 20th century (redlining, as a for instance, wasn't ended until 1977) as a matter of public record and many would argue still exist today in less overt forms.  That's a separate conversation, however."

https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming

CMIP5 is specifically addressed. It's off by a bit, by if you'll look at CMIP2 and CMIP3, the models created for that report both under-predicted climate change.  That's why some of the changes were made to the 4th and 5th generations that resulted in higher numbers. What you see is that the shape of the lines match, demonstrating correlation--that alone shows predictive value even if we aren't able to give exact numbers and each generation gets better and better with data from previous generations closing the gap even further. 

When used for policy-making, these models are run with different values to give a range. We don't see temperatures will increase by half a degree, we say .25-.75 degrees. This is just like **every other statistical model used in science** with the same limitations and drawbacks.  Nevertheless, nobody is predicting raises only to see drops.   We are clearly seeing the expected impact even if the precise extent is hard to quantify via prediction.  And again, no better alternative exists.

We are 100% right that as carbon goes up, so does the world temperature.  No data disputes that.  At this point we can only quibble about the extent of that effect.  


But regardless, here's how we solve your conundrum: pot odds. 

If the chance a thing will happen * cost of it happening > cost of stopping it from happening, then you pay that cost.  If it takes 5$ to prevent a 50/50 chance of losing $20, you take that bet every time. That holds true if it's $1 billion dollars to prevent an 11% chance of something that will cost $1 trillion dollars from happening.

Here's why I use that caveat.

1. We have a hypothesis and several models based on that hypothesis. 

2. These models not only fit the existing data better than any model not relying on human sources, they also have more predictive value than any alternative. 

3. Many of these models are now decades-old and continue to show high predictive value correlating amtospheric c02 with average temperature increases. They continue to be validated again and again year after year. To the extent that they occasionally are wrong it is almost always that they are too conservative and underestimate how much change can be expected.

4. This data aligns perfectly with what we know of Earth's Carboniferous era.

Imagine how it might fuck you up if your ""First love"", the first person you say ""I love you"" to, cuts you off the day after you had sex for the first time because you were never anything more than a means to an end for them--a lubricated hole that happened to be attached to a 14 year old body,    That's probably not a fun feeling. 18 year old guys pull this shit all the time.  They're old enough to see how easy it is to get what they want from a younger girl but not always old enough to understand the kind of pain their inflicting.   If its easy for an 18 year old, you better believe it would be a cakewalk for anyone older.  **If someone is so much more sophisticated than you that, no matter what, they're going to be able to talk you into saying ""yes"", then were  you ever really able to say ""no"" in the first place?**  And if a girl (or boy) that age really can't say ""no"", then legally we shouldn't let them say ""yes"" either.  It's the only sensible way to handle it.

But lets imagine that a relationship between a 30 year old  and a 13 year old didn't have to be inherently predatory.  Perhaps the 30 year old is super immature and the 13  year is very mature and they really do make a good couple and nobody is trying to take advantage of anybody.    It's still a terrible idea for two reasons:

1) The risks a 13 year old is taking are far higher (teenage parenthood has an outsized impact on your future life prospects). 

2) We'd be allowing countless predatory relationships where kids are simply being taken advantage of just for the sake of this one unicorn relationship. 

 If I hide a $20 bill somewhere in a literal ton (2000  pounds) of dogshit, would you let me dump that dogshit in you living room?  I mean, it has a net value of $20, right?  THe fact, is, the law can't deal with this shit on a case by case basis.  That's not how laws are written (not good laws anyways).  We need clear and simple rules and it's either draw the line at a certain age or suffer the societal consequences.  Society doesn't want that pile of dogshit and nobody wants to sift through it to try to find the value that might be in there."
changemyview,ff5ti67,t3_erqdgq,1579609658.0,"This is often the case, but is not necessarily always the case.  It's perfectly possible to provide a rich, healthy environment for beasts of burden (or food animals).  No cruelty is necessary.  You don't have to whip a horse to train it.

I would also point out that you are romanticizing the alternative.   The fact is, nature is a far crueler mistress than humanity and treats animals far worse every day.  Virtually all animals born into the wild will die horrible, painful deaths.  Only a tiny handful will see old age. 

The quality of life wild animals will enjoy is highly variable--but many will experience famine and disease.  Farm animals get care when sick.  Farm animals get fed when they are hungry.   Some farm animals, particularly the working ones (dogs and horses) may be treated like members of the family.

I'm not saying that any of that justifies human cruelty towards animals, but it should at least put it into perspective.

It also should be pointed out how increasingly rare this is as mechanical replacements become more and more affordable."
changemyview,ff5t6ik,t1_ff5dei8,1579609311.0,"The only problem with this response is that the things the OP was talking about calling socialized don't match that description.  The police are fully owned and controlled by the government.  We don't have a mixed system.  It's fully-socialized. Same with fire departments.  The only small difference is that its not under a single-centralized government authority and rather created by a patchwork of smaller jurisdictions. 

Police and Fire fighters are not operating private practices.  While OP did use healthcare  as an example of something other people want to call socialized, the things OP wants to call socialized really are."
changemyview,ff4j9za,t3_erm4z2,1579564952.0,"> Now listen I have nothing against trans people, Im all for it. I really couldnt give a shit if you wanted to change gender, its not my problem nor business. But to act like youre another completely different sex because you got a wig, chopped off your penis, had some plastic surgery and took some pills just doesnt do it for me. Im not saying there still men but they just arent ""real"" women.

I mean, even if you think this, does it functionally change how you should treat them in any way? Whether you personally think they are women or not, do you have any good reason to not treat them as though they were women, knowing that's how they want to be treated.

If so, let's talk about that   If not, then you're saying you will treat transwomen the same as you treat women so what does the distinction matter?  Doesn't this become entirely academic?

> Now listen(2) I dont wanna here any of that ""gEnDEr iS a SoCIaL cONstRucT"" bs. Give me a proper argument.

I mean, this is sort silly since it's provably true that gender is a social construct. You're basically saying, **don't use the argument that disproves what I'm saying to disprove what I'm saying**.  Seems a silly way to stack the deck in a dispute."
changemyview,ff366wg,t3_er7f9m,1579534635.0,"Here's the reason why it comes off as transphobic: if you went to a public venue or, even worse a Muslim, and announced ""Allah is not the one true God"" then suddenly you've gone beyond holding that belief and into an area where it certainly seems islamophobic.

changemyview,ff08boj,t3_er1ogs,1579466223.0,"If you're willing to settle for a moderately attractive man, you too can find an easy sex partner.  So technically, I think only heterosexual men can claim to have an issue here--not all men. 

But anyways we assume the gap you describe exists, it almost certainly has to represent a difference in average male sex drive vs average female sex drive.  A gap between supply and demand when the number of potential partners is the same, really can't be explained any other way. What a woman has to offer is, realistically, more in demand than what you have to offer. Her ""You should feel lucky"" view is objectively correct. She's giving you something that a free market would dictate has a higher value than what you can offer in return simply because of the gap in demand.  

So do you imagine there's a realistic solution?  Seems like your point is, at best, largely academic because we all just have to accept ""That's the way it is."""

She was an expensive baby--but still just $100 for us.  Hospital also sent us home with a ton of blankets, books, nipples and diapers.

changemyview,fek5lsc,t1_feizxg1,1579193094.0,"Oddly, I've heard people complaining of exactly the opposite problem.  Most women don't sit to pee, they hover.  Any women who doesn't hover risks sitting in pee from the last woman who did.  If no one women hovered, no women would **need** to hover.  But as a classic real world prisoners dilemma scenario, the optimal solution, unless women collude, is for each woman to hover because any woman who hovers never sits in pee. 

I've heard cleaning staff say that women get **more** pee on the toilet seats as a result of this phenemonon.  It seems likely that this would ultimately translate to men if they felt obliged to sit and pee but didn't trust the seat."
