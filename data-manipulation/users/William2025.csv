WarCollege,ffgcys8,t1_ffgc8ov,1579903481.0,"Thank you for taking the time to answer my question. I did not know that the Fighting Falcon initially did not have any radar guided missiles. I agree that the introduction of off boresight missiles like the AIM 9X and HMDs contributed to the change of dogfighting from a marathon to a ""sprint to an acceptable firing position"". Back in the day of simpler, rear aspect, low kill probability missiles, fighters had to get into a perfect position to fire. Now you have missiles that can turn 180 degrees."

hoggit,fe076zw,t1_fdz6zfm,1578804858.0,It would suck after a long mission in the F-14/18 to die by not realizing you’re landing on the wrong carrier and crashing into water.

FitToFat,fdp1usb,t1_fdp1qta,1578618004.0,There’s always hope but in my opinion people tend to stay fat.
moderatepolitics,fdp1jlx,t1_fdp0o70,1578617794.0,"Thanks for the information. Now that you mentioned it, in past elections after the primary, I almost never see political ads. Probably because neither parties have any reason to keep running ads."
moderatepolitics,fdow457,t1_fdoouig,1578614218.0,"I’m in Oklahoma, a solid red state, and I often see Bloomberg ads. Like Mike, you’re wasting your money try to flip Oklahoma blue. It’s a better use of money to buy ads in a state that flips between blue and red."
unpopularopinion,fdlyra1,t1_fdlwjro,1578535705.0,A problem with your argument is that pirated material is of similar quality to the paid product most of the time unlike food in the trash.

unpopularopinion,fd4z0gx,t1_fd4v464,1578172572.0,"If those 3rd world countries were full of white people in the same conditions, I would still call them shitholes. It's not racist to call those countries shitholes."

MGTOW,fc7nqrc,t1_fc7mkll,1577513634.0,"If you think of the 2016 election as votes for Trump being upvotes and votes for Clinton being downvotes, Donald still won with millions of negative votes."
fatlogic,fbxdjcw,t1_fbxc8ol,1577181648.0,It's pretty much the same as a poor person claiming that a price on a menu is judging them. Both calories and price on a menu cannot judge someone and is purely to prevent overeating/overspending.
