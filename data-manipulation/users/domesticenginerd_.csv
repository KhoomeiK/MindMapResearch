I am sorry to hear that you are wrestling with  negative feelings right now.

About the reset button, it sounds like you want to change paths. I hope that if there are things that you want to change and they’re in your control to change, that you are able to take many baby steps to be the person you want to be!

I hope that with time, you’re able to grow to accept yourself as you are (warts and all, as we all have things we can work on)! I also hope that you are given people around you that lift you up and remind you of your strengths."

I know you’re not OP, but thank you for sharing the bacon story. (I really appreciated your insights on this comment in general!)

For the pork thing, if you want to stop (or even reduce) your bacon consumption, then I think it’s admirable that you’re trying!

Sometimes I set goals and fall short. When they’re important to me, I try to keep getting up. Your post reminded me of the value of continuing to get up and work towards my goals!"
SuicideWatch,ffb71nk,t3_esiho1,1579753524.0,"Hi there, it sounds like things have been though. I am sorry to hear that! I am not sure if this is what you are feeling, but I know that I sometimes feel discouraged when something doesn’t go my way (or when I have a series of small and medium sized things that don’t go my way.)

Are there things in particular that you hope get better by the date? 

And were there any things that went well (or even OK) today for you?"
