bipolar2,ffjiit6,t1_ffji121,1579998983.0,"That’s an understatement. And we certainly fucking don’t, do we haha. I work in the ED and it’s definitely been a trigger to my moods. Need to find something less chaotic."
bipolar2,ffjcuhc,t1_ffjcma4,1579995604.0,"That’s where I was at (with help from family). Also, off-topic, but I’m a nurse, too. I encourage you to look into it further once you get insurance coverage as some insurance companies *will* help cover the infusions while others don’t seem to."
bipolar2,ffjbjpz,t1_ffijk40,1579994845.0,"I just started ketamine treatments Friday after severe treatment-resistant depressive episodes. It’s definitely starting to help, maybe even life-changing, but they are pricey just to warn you. But in my experience so far, worth the money."
bipolar,ffh1k7z,t1_ffgpcre,1579920638.0,"The vast majority of antipsychotics gave me panic attacks or severe racing thoughts too. You’re not alone. Seroquel doesn’t do this in low doses for me, but I can’t tolerate higher ones. I am grateful for it."
bipolar2,ffd3y58,t3_esx5mm,1579812949.0,I’m noticing some of the same things you described regarding agitation and irritability along with anxiety. This is day 8 of my titration.
cowboyboots,ffck7hx,t3_esmwzm,1579801214.0,"I’m hopefully transitioning from working in a hospital setting to working in a more corporate setting. Which means boots are officially acceptable footwear. I’ll need to stock up on these on a couple colors, they’re handsome as hell."
cowboyboots,ffck0i1,t3_esvzhm,1579801097.0,"Solid boots, bro. I dig the toe"
cowboyboots,ff70e0q,t3_erz7ik,1579638606.0,Ariat has always been a brand I appreciate. Solid pair.
bipolar2,ff44az7,t1_ff41gim,1579555228.0,I should clarify she’s more apt to put me on bupropion than an SSRI. Mainly I’ve just been asking her for an antidepresssnt.
bipolar2,ff387ss,t3_erb2pr,1579536001.0,It has helped me significantly in the past. I’d like to go back on it but my doctor isn’t on board because of my bipolar diagnosis.
cowboyboots,fezopb4,t1_fezogiu,1579459754.0,"I’ve seen two docs do it with Ariat Ramblers, a little more low-key. I was jealous."
