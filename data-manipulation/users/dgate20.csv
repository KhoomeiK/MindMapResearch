One of my favorite things to do though is play video games and board games with my kids.  They love games and play every day, but we can enjoy them together on the weekend.  

I don't think you should give up on games if you still have fun with them.  My biggest turn off from games, is all of the microtransactions and DLC content for the games.  Let me pay $60 for a game and that be it, don't give me $10 updates every 3 months. There are quite a few game players that make a living just playing video games in competitions."

I had a girl crush that told me she didn't have a boyfriend.  I ended up kissing her (nothing more) and it turned out she did have a boyfriend.  I felt like an ass, but I technically didn't do anything wrong.

You can't control who you get feelings for, but if there's someone that's not directly in your circle of friends and you want to pull them in and you think you have a crush on them, I think on some level you have other intentions."

I think it also depends on if you have boobs and how big they are.  A female at the same height of a male with roughly the same build, if the female has large breasts, they are bound to weigh more.

I'm about 200 lbs and I have a little bit of a belly, but I wouldn't consider myself fat.  I think you are fine at that weight."

I think if you are physically attracted to a specific body part/have a type that you would go after a person of that body type to begin with.

I find that a lot of men and some women are very stupid when it comes to relationships.  I'm nowhere near perfect, but to me a woman's race/color/size isn't as important as the emotional connection made.

I'm sorry about the way things ended.  To me, it sounds a lot like you were a lot more invested in him, than he was in you.  You sound like quite the catch, I'm sure you'll find someone that is worthy of you.

I used to hear people say things like ""Oh, that's so gay."" meaning that something is horrible/sucks/is shitty.  I never understood why that was ever used in that context.  It's like saying ""YES!

I know someone who was planning to go to school forever so that they would never have to pay them off.  I frowned at them.  

As far as the other debt, you will have to talk to some people that have experience in this area as I do not know if filing bankruptcy will screw you for future student loans.  Last I checked, bankruptcy didn't include student loans so those still needed to be paid, but if you can prolong it because you are going back to school, that will help that.

On the flip side, I had another ex who took a long time and after doing it once, couldn't even be touched after.  Everyone is different."

TooAfraidToAsk,fdjlxkv,t3_eljwtb,1578477218.0,"People get sleep paralysis so that they don't act out their dreams and hurt themselves (everyone has this happen).  When you wake up, your body is supposed to wake up too.  Sometimes your nightmares wake your mind up, but not your body and it can take a minute or two for your body to catch up.  I've noticed that if an alarm or some external stimuli wakes me up, I don't have the problem of waking up while being paralyzed.  It's usually when I force myself awake from a bad dream that I'm stuck and unable to move.  It can be quite unsettling and I don't really have any advice for how to stop it as it still happens to me on occasion.

I've had nightmares that look like a normal dream, there's nothing to be scared of or frightening in the dream, but I feel terrified, it's just the fear itself.   I think it's something in your real life that your subconscious is trying to make sense of.  I'm not sure why it comes out the way it does. 

If this is a regular occurrence, you might go to a sleep clinic and see if you have sleep apnea or some other disorder.  I think the lack of oxygen and struggling to breathe can cause some pretty messed up dreams to happen."

TooAfraidToAsk,fdjjlxr,t3_elg1a9,1578473865.0,"There are always going to be stupid people that judge others for things.  My son got made fun of for wearing super hero emblems, like spiderman shirts or batman shoes.  I went to his school a few times and I wore my spiderman sneakers and my superman shirt (I even wore a my little pony shirt once).  I tried to show him that it's okay to like things and you shouldn't let others opinion affect you like that, but it is what it is.

When I was in my early 20s my gf was 19 and she slept with a Winnie the Pooh that I bought her.  She explained to her friends that asked her about it that it reminded her of me and it was a good substitution for when I wasn't there.  I know it's not the same as your situation but I believe that you should do what makes you happy.  Don't conform with what others think is ""acceptable"" and make yourself feel bad."
self,fcqglb8,t3_eii8jn,1577885610.0,"Time heals all.  It will get better you just have to be patient.  I was in love with someone for a year or two, and to be honest I still think of her fondly, but that hurt of not being near her is gone and there was months which eventually turned into years where I didn't once think about her.  We're still friends and we talk from time to time, but that, just got your heart stomped on feeling disappeared a long time ago as I'm sure yours will too.  Hang in there!"
TooAfraidToAsk,fcqey87,t1_fcpplp0,1577884675.0,"I agree with Kirsi.  I don't have anything else to add, I just wanted you (zshinyg) to know that someone is sending good thoughts your way."
college,fcqe59o,t3_eii44m,1577884196.0,"Different subjects/skills come easy to different people.  Some people can add a bunch of numbers and do complex algebra in their heads, while others need to write things down.  Some people can look at an object and paint a masterpiece and while it may look easy when they do it, they've probably been painting their whole lives.

I wouldn't choose or not choose a major because of the difficulty.  Do something because you like it and have a genuine interest in it.  As you practice/study it can / will get easier.  You don't want to choose something easy and then hate getting up in the morning and hate going to class or work."
TooAfraidToAsk,fcqdh1q,t3_ei5sew,1577883830.0,"I'm not 100% sure because I was never like that.  I know how to and always did speak to females, no differently than males.  Well, scratch that I was more polite when speaking to females and sometimes a little flirty.  By that, I mean that I complimented them and helped boost their self esteem.  I didn't go around telling guys they looked ""nice"" or anything, but I would to females.  Now when I meet new people, male or female, I don't immediately cuss/curse/swear without seeing how comfortable the other person is with that sort of language.

I did have several guy friends and a few did have problems talking to girls.  Some were just shy around girls in general because they were intimidated by pretty girls regardless of having any real romantic interest in them.  If any of them have girlfriends, I know there are a lot of crazy jealous girls that freaked out about their boyfriend speaking to any other girls.  (I knew plenty of guys that behaved the same way.)  

You said, without going into details so if you are on dating sites or hookup sites, they may not be interested in talking.  If they are school/classmates, they could just be shy/nervous.  You can try to break people out of their shell, but it takes time, be patient."

self,fadmlgy,t3_e8jw1n,1575979145.0,"I've been going through randomly on reddit from time to time trying to talk people out of doing stupid shit like that, especially teens.  I don't believe that anybody should have to go out like that, and I feel horrible for the poor souls who find the aftermath.  I have a few female friends in Colorado, I should really check to make sure it's not one of them."
