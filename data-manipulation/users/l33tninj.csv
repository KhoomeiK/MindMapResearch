projectmanagement,fdr4kjb,t3_emtzzb,1578679381.0,Ha. I immediately thought Smartsheet before reading your second paragraph. PM me if you want a tour of how it works and how to set it up.
getdisciplined,fdmedzg,t1_fdkg8js,1578547170.0,"I'm better at working through this than I used to be. Things that helped: 

* Brain dump on paper at the first hint of 'future planning vs. present doing'. Anything about how I'm going to change process or habits goes on a list to review on Sunday. Anything I can just execute now goes on the to do list in order. 
* Doing one thing at a time until it's done. The book 'One Thing' by G. Keller helped with this.
* Picking the right things and sticking to them regardless of emotional thrashing and anxiety. The book 'Turning Pro' by S. Pressfield helped with this. (War of Art, also great.)"

getdisciplined,fd7nuv1,t3_ek701g,1578207353.0,I do this kinda thing in Lucidchart.  [https://www.lucidchart.com/](https://www.lucidchart.com/)
projectmanagement,fcji0ze,t1_fcjgo1r,1577688363.0,Clinical Research Associate. It's like a project associate for clinical studies. I'm sure an MBA is always good to have but my personal opinion is I'd rather get paid to do real work and gain industry knowledge & connections than pay (or go into debt) for the kind of general knowledge offered in an MBA or similar degree.
projectmanagement,fcjgg1p,t3_eh8mmo,1577686682.0,You're describing my career path pretty closely. Biochem degree > research coordinator for biotech company > CRA > PMP/ Research Program Manager > Self Employed Consultant. I think PMP is a great move for many industries.
