Thanks"
mlb,fehpjoj,t1_fehoq9s,1579121306.0,"From NBC Sports, “They don’t seem to be following up on those seven or eight teams Verducci mentions.”

I don’t believe anyone outside of The Astros and Boston have been mentioned."
mlb,feh37qm,t1_fefh73b,1579108212.0,Not sure why they downvoted you.  It’s clearly spelled out in the news.   There were 7 (I think) other teams named after Houston and Boston.  You’re not saying they are guilty of anything.
iphone,fegjxma,t3_eozze6,1579095031.0,I don’t understand why they haven’t gone to USB-C.  My iPad Pro and MBP are both USB.  It’s almost inconvenient for my iPhone to not be USB-C.
macbook,fedcx69,t3_eokk8m,1579007947.0,"I went in store and compared the size.  I didn’t realize how freaking big the 16 is.  

Make sure you’re ready to jump up in size that’s the only thing I can say.  I stayed with my 2017 MBP 13 due to the size difference."
MacOS,fed8cxw,t3_eod69i,1579003488.0,"I use safari.  No problems at all... which might be because I haven’t utilized the others as much as I should. 

I have Firefox and Chrome for when I want to change things up, but I feel like I get so much more battery life with Safari. I’m on the go a lot and need the extra battery life."
macbook,fe7o8sc,t3_eo2bk1,1578917371.0,"My recommendation is to always buy a new cable first.  You can always return a cable and normally you can get one within a day or two. 

If it’s not the cable I’d try connecting a different device and if that device doesn’t work try connecting your MBP to another monitor if you can. 

A lot of guess and check work with this kind of scenario sadly.

Edit: Is your MBP idle, or active when it goes dark?"

StopGaming,fe4us2l,t1_fe4u3dr,1578862995.0,"I streamed for awhile, nothing that amazing. Made some money here and there, but the majority of my money came from winning Starcraft 2 Tournaments, selling LoL  accounts and selling WOW items. 

Also, made a few thousand dollars from selling Runescape gold."

college,fe3ceyq,t3_enis2c,1578848019.0,"I took Calc 1 over the summer.  Depending on which summer sessions are available determines how doable it is. 

If it’s your first ever short semester class I recommend taking a longer session if possible.  

I believe my class was 12 weeks.  So 4 weeks shorter than the regular semester.  

I did homework on the days I didn’t have class and relaxed on the days I had class.  

My main tip would be to pre-plan study time.  Math mid terms and finals in the summer hit you quick!"
college,fe3br0t,t3_enjsw7,1578847859.0,Snack Pack Pudding.
college,fe3bmap,t3_en9a8e,1578847817.0,For some reason Snack Pack Pudding was my guilty pleasure.   Didn’t have to refrigerate it and it kept me going through studying.
ClashRoyale,fe06cpx,t3_enfpof,1578804184.0,"Depending on the deck you’re playing. 12 log is good enough.  

If you aren’t playing xbow or a deck that needs the extra log chip damage I’d buy the bandit first to 13.  Then get the log after that."
ipad,fdzxajz,t1_fdzwwz5,1578798049.0,"Just read what you’ll be doing.  I’d recommend downsizing to the 13. 

If you need a bigger screen for editing pictures just get a really good external monitor.  That’s what I did."
ipad,fdzw60d,t3_enhhgz,1578797245.0,"I am currently running: MBP 13, iPad Pro

I love how they compliment each other.  If you need the bigger screen/power from the 16 I don’t think you should switch.  However, I can use my iPad on the go for anything. Come home and pick up where I left off with my MBP and multiple screens.  

I don’t think the iPad can replace my MBP due to the crazy amount of files I keep on my MBP and some of the premium programs I use.  

However, the iPad Pro is my go to device on the day to day.  It’s an awesome compliment if you can afford it.

Edit: What do you do and what will you use these for?  I work full time in finance and I am a student.  So I use both."
college,fdwal7d,t1_fdw0hpl,1578756736.0,"Way to write it down!  So many people make these goals and don’t have anything to keep themselves accountable.  

Hopefully you stick to your goals.  Good luck this semester!"
college,fdhhpft,t3_elcmhp,1578422876.0,"What I have learned is that you have to give some stuff up if you’re going to be working a lot.  

I work 40 hours a week and am taking 14 hours this semester.  

I plan out everything from the day I get my syllabus.  I plan off days, I plan study days, I refuse to have a social life the majority of the semester except for the occasional happy hour and Sunday Brunch.  

The best piece of advice I can give is time management and prioritize work and school over everything.   If you are in a relationship plan date nights ahead of time and if you have children plan time with them throughout the week. 

Once you get into a good schedule/routine it becomes less stressful and more manageable.  However, finals can be a major bitch if you don’t start studying earlier than the average student."
mac,fcvs13i,t1_fcvhjbu,1578008800.0,"Smart idea.  I got the 13 due to thinking the other was too big.  Now I carry an iPad Pro to classes for notes and have my MBP at home,  but I see people on campus with larger laptops all the time.  100% personal preference.   No matter what you decide as long as you go mid level MBP 13 with touch bar you should be happy.  

Without Touch Bar base model doesn’t have enough ports in my opinion."
mac,fcvck91,t3_ej3ntr,1577999257.0,"I’m a student, but I’m in grad school and only really use my MBP for papers/YouTube/Netflix and photo editing.  

I have a 2018 MBP 13in 8gb RAM and 512gb storage.  This mode meets all the standard needs of a major that does not require heavy computer use (computer science/engineering majors tend to have higher spec devices when I was in undergrad). 

With your budget and how long you want to keep it I’d go for a mid level build MBP 16in.  They’re not obnoxiously large and you could tote it around campus easy.  

If you’re stuck on the 13 with your budget I’d just go top of the line with 16gb of RAM.  You have the money and it will for sure last."
StopGaming,fcgf27o,t3_eh3y3h,1577639309.0,"I had to sell my gaming PC.  If you think you need to do something DO IT!  Your gut feeling is extremely underrated. 

I wish you the best!"
StopGaming,fcgelii,t3_eh87gc,1577639200.0,"I would set up some basic guidelines if I was you.  

For example: 

M-F school work is done and nothing else planned hop on and play. 

Sat-Sun do I have any projects/papers for school that need done?   Do I have any friend/family events to go to?   Do I have any passions/hobbies I want to pursue?  No to all of that then play.  

The point when video games are a problem is when you’re not passing school, playing them at work, skipping class, skipping family time, skipping friend time, or not having a hobby to better yourself (reading, musical instrument, working out, etc).  

It sounds like you don’t want to fall in an area of bad habits.   I think that as long as you can moderate yourself you’ll be fine.  If you don’t think you can moderate yourself then that’s a different story.  

Personally, I played video games too much.  Sold my gaming PC and now all I play is hearthstone and random iOS games.  I only play them on my iPad after I’ve done all my other activities.  

Some people can handle moderation, others cannot.  You have to find out if you have the discipline to moderate your life."

StopGaming,fbtck3x,t3_ee01mh,1577074513.0,"The only thing I can really suggest based on what you said is this: 

1) You have health issues.  This is something you shouldn’t ignore, at all. 

2) You have friends that live far from you so you want to stay in touch via games.  This is 100% understandable and totally fine. 

3) You want more time for other things. 


Here’s the suggestion: Only play games with friends, or if you’re going to do a little solo play to calm down/take a break from life.  However, only play the amount of hours you work out.  2 hours of working out 6 days a week = 12 hours of game play.  1 hour a day 6 days a week = 6 hours of gameplay.  

Personally, if I was ever told my health needed to be addressed that’s what I would work on ASAP.  Friends, games, girls, drugs, sex, whatever it is people crave is worth nothing if you’re dead. 

I think you have a great starting point, but please do yourself a favor and take care of yourself.  You sound like you want to and I hope you find a system that works well for you.  I know you’ll do great if you stick around here, or somewhere else for accountability.  

Good luck! :)

Edit: I started the same way as you.  Cutting back a little bit.  Now I’m at the point where as of 2020 I’m going 100% game free!  DM me if you ever have any questions."
