If they had a non functioning brain and couldn’t experience suffering, would you feel any worse using them for food than you currently do using plants, which also don’t have a functioning brain and also can’t experience suffering?

So what you’re saying is that the ability to keep, store, and record memories is what’s important, not necessarily the physiological idea of a brain?"
vegancirclejerk,fffybzn,t1_fffxt05,1579894473.0,"Okay. So this is the premise of your argument:

>	You can’t make an accurate statement about what X creature experiences, because you have not ANY experience of being that creature.

I agree and it is one of the hardest remaining questions I have about consciousness. What is it like to be a bat, for example? Or, how do you know that other humans, like me, aren’t just biological robots, zombies in a sense, able to respond to real world stimuli but with no experience or consciousness involved?

What about plants? What do you think about plants in this argument? Just a hypothetical, I’m interested. I personally don’t know how to reconcile the fact that I don’t know for *sure* that plants aren’t conscious with the fact that I need to eat.

Rocks? You don’t know what it’s like to be a rock - is there a simple way to exclude rocks from moral consideration under your rule? Again this is an entirely genuine question. I’m not sure how to fit the rest of the world under your rule, which is why utilitarianism seems to fit better in my mind. If something cannot suffer, under utilitarianism, we don’t need to consider how our decisions impact it."

vegancirclejerk,fffwzpp,t1_fffwqzn,1579893639.0,"First off, I have barely any clue what your first or third paragraphs mean in context here. Could you clarify?

Did you read the page I linked? I think you’re misinterpreting my words. **Utilitarianism is the philosophy that states we should strive to minimize bad feelings (read: suffering) and maximize good feelings (read: happiness)**. A prerequisite to being morally considered is obviously that *you need to be able to experience* feelings, and that is the crux of it. 

>""What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog, is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?"""

vegancirclejerk,fffwia8,t1_fffulsw,1579893335.0,"Also, if there are caveats to your moral rule, it’s a good sign that your rule is slightly off the mark. You can attempt to refine it further so that it works in 100% of scenarios."
vegancirclejerk,fffwart,t1_fffulsw,1579893205.0,"Simmer down.  I bet we ultimately hold the same beliefs, vegan anticonsumerist antinatalist environmentalist abolitionist etc, the only difference is that my beliefs are based on utilitarian philosophy - [here’s a good intro](https://utilitarianism.fandom.com/wiki/Vegetarianism_and_veganism) - striving to minimize the amount of bad feelings and maximize the amount of good feelings, whereas you seem to base your beliefs on the physiology of the lifeform itself, which as we know in modern science is not necessarily indicative of that lifeform’s abilities, especially not the ability to experience life in a certain way."
vegancirclejerk,fffvz8a,t1_fffusey,1579893000.0,"Yes, if someone’s braindead and never coming back, and cannot suffer or feel anything or experience anything at all, then I don’t see much moral weight to continuing their existence. Of course, we shouldn’t kill them for no reason, but except in the most unlikely situations I would choose a conscious human over them in a trolley problem scenario. 

They’re alive, but not conscious and not capable of ever becoming conscious again. Of course, there are many real world nuances, like the possibility of medicine advancing far enough to revive the person, but my point stands."
vegancirclejerk,fffubs1,t1_ffftd94,1579891965.0,"Also, having a brain doesn’t necessitate awareness of suffering, example: person in a coma."
vegancirclejerk,ffftvlm,t1_ffftd94,1579891687.0,"So you agree the suffering is the truly important part here, not the existence of a brain. Correct?
