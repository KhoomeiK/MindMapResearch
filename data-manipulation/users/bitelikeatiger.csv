dogs,ff9oqud,t3_esfjna,1579717480.0,"Wow, I thought we had a tough decision when our Dane tore both hers at the same time. Our choice then was surgery or euthanasia—waiting and seeing what happens, especially when multiple legs are compromised just doesn’t seem like much of an option for me."
dogs,ff7c6v3,t1_ff7bsx8,1579646133.0,"Sounds like a more solid plan. I’ve loved every ridgeback that I’ve dealt with professionally. And some of the females have been what I would consider large, not extra large. 

We have three Danes, but they typically aren’t our road trip companions or the ones that go out to dinner with us. 160 lbs does not lay comfortably under a patio table."
dogs,ff76o5g,t3_erni1k,1579642176.0,"Great Danes slobber like machines. And shed more than most people think. 

The other thing is, you mention that you’d lean more towards the dog doing its own thing if it’s on a scale. Danes are the worlds largest lap dogs, and are constantly going to be in your face, on your lap, etc.  not sure of a breed suggestion, but I don’t think this would be the one for you."
dogs,ff73k06,t3_ervc5u,1579640414.0,"My five girls get along better than my three boys any day of the week. In my experience, just keeping an eye out for resource guarding or potential spats or playing too rough is the best help. Also work individually on training so that having the dogs together doesn’t just turn into a free for all where they only pay attention to each other and not you."
dogs,feniuxa,t3_epzhmb,1579285635.0,"Entirely dependent on the person/couple. Right now we have 8 and a temporary foster. As long as no one is going without medical care, attention, etc. the limit is just dependent on what you’re comfortable with. Unfortunately, I think a lot of people don’t know how many is too many until they’ve crossed a line and realized they’re overwhelmed. 

My SO and I are still young (23 and 27), but we want our numbers to go down from here, not up. I would not be in my 50’s and have this many dogs. But, because we do have so many dogs we are child free right now. I think mixing multiple dogs and young children is just asking for trouble and although it could be done, I wouldn’t want the stress of it."
dogs,fefsycd,t3_eovqo8,1579064254.0,"It was a rough year this year, but for Christmas my husband had a friend draw a portrait of my grandmother holding the two cats and a dog who passed this year. Best gift ever and I love coming home to it."
dogs,fec8yfw,t1_fec0uuc,1578968746.0,Thankfully our Pyrenees is much more of a gentleman than the Danes are! He keeps that tail tucked lol
dogs,feb2163,t1_feai7zh,1578954725.0,The coffee table was the first thing we sold when we added the Danes. And we only have drinks with lids now. Those tails are a weapon of a mass destruction.
dogs,fe9uhzl,t1_fe9oqct,1578941565.0,Best dogs ever— I can’t recommend them enough! But it’s certainly an acquired taste hah.
dogs,fe9alku,t1_fe988mk,1578935892.0,"Lol that and just standing over when you sit in the recliner, staring into your very soul b/c how dare you not share your tiny spot. Or following you to the bathroom and opening the door with your mouth because you have a head the size of a watermelon and know how to open all doors and baby gates (thanks Willie!!)"
dogs,fe95ffz,t3_eo5tdp,1578934401.0,"As a Dane owner, Great Danes and “big dog that can do their own thing.” AHAHAHAGAHAHAHAHAHA."
dogs,fe6h2t7,t3_enx104,1578890688.0,"Same!! Except the trainer we contacted wanted our nervous dog to stop all vet behaviorist meds and immediately begin “detoxing” with a home cooked diet overseen by yet another trainer who would advise us via video recordings of him eating?? Because his gut was the route of all his behaviors, and the Purina food caused his separation anxiety. 

Like, my dog doesn’t need a juice cleanse, but thanks."
dogs,fdto9h6,t3_en2iy2,1578719659.0,"Copying from another dog comment I made last week “ (dog tore) Both legs at the same time last summer—2 months of super restrictive crate rest, 2 months of being in a playpen on less restrictive rest. lots of frozen Kongs and puzzle feedings, and helping a big ass Great Dane get around. The worst time was the three days between her injury and surgery. Post surgery she could walk, whereas for those three days before we had to carry a 125 lbs around. 

100% worth it. I have my dog back. Fetches and runs like a puppy again. It was surgery or euthanasia for us—we made the right choice.” 

You don’t even need a fancy sling, you can just use a towel to put under the belly, hold both ends like a u and that will help support them. Also, theyll go when they have to go as bad as it sounds. We kept a lot of pee pads directly under her on top of all her bedding and  just changed them when walking was too exhausting for her."

crafts,fbilmyh,t3_edl4ql,1576904829.0,"So so sorry for your loss. 

I do this several times a week in my vet clinic. In order to get a better print you may need to use more pressure than you think you are if that makes sense. We also generally trim the nails and clip the hair from between the paw pads as these will obscure the print. A kit from a craft store would be your best bet—we buy ours from the crematory. 

You can also do ink on a card or paint on a canvas. With ink or paint—less is more. If you over saturate the paw you will get less definition and less of what makes your pups paw print their own. I generally apply paint or ink with a cotton ball. You can also get some really cute nose prints this way too."
