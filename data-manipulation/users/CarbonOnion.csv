chaoticgood,fdxxmmz,t1_fdxmnyi,1578773929.0,"Yes. Communist and socialist countries (wonderful on paper always terrible in execution) have crime too. But its motivated by a similar reason. Pure capitalism is absolutely a motivator for crime, and the system needs to be incredibly reworked. 

Its not just capitalism = bad because reddit economics. Capitalism = bad because the capitalist incentive is to gain money and power. It can be good, but often times gives lower membera of society little or very difficult opportunities to rise or achieve financial stability. 

Capitalism is bad because it encourages pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers to work based on profit and not effectiveness or to help others. Capitalism isnt always bad. But perhaps we should keep it out of basic human needs, or put restrictions on it.

Again I'm not saying we need to go full communist. That wont work either. I'm just saying the capitalist mindset doesnt always work. Without resteiction those with more money are free to secure their power, gain more money, and make sure their progeny benefit. The poor are forced to struggle and make immense sacrifices to get by

We dont need to ditch capitalism, but we need to do some heavy playing field leveling. Theres plenty of literature on this, and I'd be more than happy to discuss it with you if you DM me ^^"

Definitely NOT something to be lobbed in with lgbt people. Definitely NOT something thats just ""another sexual preference""

Buuut.

I think to say that all pedophiles are terrible people that should rot in hell isnt a good sentiment either. Instead people should be encouraged to seek help from non-judgemental sources before their issues affect real children!

Again if you act on these urges or otherwise abuse a child? Sympathy ends there. ""Love is love"" is no defense for abusing children who have no concept of consent."

me_irl,fch5wbg,t1_fch3khn,1577647582.0,"I agree the way we teach just about everything is flawed. And theres definitely better things to be teaching than things like precalc or other higher level classes in highschool.

However my real point was that basic algebra is fairly fundamental maths that provides a useful way to think about the world. Slope formulas, while not being very useful on their own, provide a useful way to teach and learn algebra. 

Yes taxes and loans and adulting stuff are important, but a basic understanding of the world is inctedibly useful! Not only just for you but the others you live with in a democratic society.

I agree that the way we teach now is extremely flawed and not truly focused on actually teaching. But I dont think at all that we should do away with teaching fundamental classes like algebra, chemistry, or literature/english."
