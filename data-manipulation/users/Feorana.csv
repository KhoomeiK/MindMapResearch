It was a looonng drive and I was going with friends who were also picking up her sister. We didn't get back until about midnight. So they met with a lot of supervision in our kitchen. Nanaki (the Akita) growled a bit at first, but when Aerith was climbing on top of him moments later and he just let her, I knew it was fine. We did baby gates in the house to separate the two of them so Nanaki could have time to get used to her. They are best friends. Just go slow and it'll be okay. http://imgur.com/gallery/tczDV0p"

Dogtraining,fghe7ha,t3_eycuj6,1580782862.0,"My akita did this when he was younger.  It happened when he got over aroused by something.  It used to HURT.  I would suggest getting in contact with a behaviorist so you can nip it in the bud. Biting is never fun.  What she suggested for us was very specific to our case so I won't share it here, but it really helped us.  I have no other advice except that impulse control training worked wonders for us with other things, so maybe that might help you with this."
FinalFantasy,fggcpcf,t1_fgg4ywu,1580759095.0,Agreed
FinalFantasy,fgg0sp1,t1_fgfxv9s,1580751777.0,Took the words right out of my mouth. The facial expression is a little over sexualized as well.
akita,fgfds1r,t3_ey6sjv,1580735669.0,"Nanaki used to do that when he was little. I would just pick him up, walk a little ways, then put him down again. When he got too big for that, I would just stand my ground until he moved. 3 months is very little though, he shouldn't be walking more than 10-15 minutes at a time at that age."
dogs,fgfdkxc,t3_ey6ne4,1580735478.0,"Shibas are a mouthy breed by nature, and biting/nipping is not uncommon for them. Mine used to mouth me when she wanted pets. My friends' Shiba is temperamental too, and does bite on occasion. For example, if they wake her up from a nap by accident, her response is to nip. She never breaks skin though. What scares me here, is that your girlfriend had to get 10 stitches from just hugging you. That's not normal behavior and almost seems like he's resource guarding you. I think you might need professional help for this. I would recommend finding a veterinary behaviorist in your area if they exist where you are, or even another trainer that specializes in behavior."
FinalFantasy,fg3u06e,t1_fg3gnu7,1580489642.0,I always pick the non human characters. Red xiii is my favorite in all of the series. I named my dog Nanaki after him. :)
FinalFantasy,fg3mta5,t1_fg38u6w,1580485201.0,Lol I'm going to take time off too!

Dogtraining,ffxt9be,t3_evsxeu,1580331972.0,"There is a Facebook group- pyramid dog treats. They have hundreds of recipes for treats. If you don't have a pyramid pan, you should get one. They're technically for draining grease, but if you flip them upside down, you can fill the pyramid shapes with batter and bake in them. They pop right out if you cook the treats enough. My favorite type to make is with canned salmon, oat flour, and egg. I'm also a fan of the old mother hubbard treats. Way healthier than milkbone and they make small ones that are perfect for me."
Dogtraining,ffxsmg6,t3_evplpn,1580331611.0,"That's totally normal for a shiba. I have an Akita and a Samoyed. They BOTH play that way. It makes me a little nervous too sometimes, but they seem to enjoy it. I think that's just a northern breed play style. Don't punish him. If it gets too much for you, you can separate them and give puppy a nice chill out treat. (A kong, a bully stick, or I use freeze dried sweet potato treats) that's what I do for my guys when their play gets too rough for me. It Seems to calm them down so they're not as insane when they go back to playing."
FinalFantasy,ffj2e3a,t3_etusb6,1579988666.0,"Erutan has a good version of this on YouTube with lyrics. https://youtu.be/qmbgCBZ86z4 it's also one of my favorite songs of the series. As much as I love FFVII, the soundtrack isn't as good IMO. I love all the Celtic style themes in IX's soundtrack. It is by far my favorite of the series."
Dogtraining,fffzww0,t3_etaskq,1579895451.0,"Our Samoyed HATED her crate. She pretty much did the same things you're describing. We just had to be consistent. I also put some of the clothes I wore that day in there with her. Then we got her a stuffed dog that has a fake heartbeat and both of those things seemed to really help her calm down enough in there that we could begin crate training for real. She still doesn't love the crate, but she will go in voluntarily for a frozen Kong, and I'm able to crate her at trials without too much carrying on. She still goes insane though if I have both of them at a trial and I bring out the older dog first instead of her. :/ Baby steps."
dogs,fds8foo,t3_emnqy7,1578696718.0,"Nanaki gets called Shmee or shmee-boop on occasion. Aerith gets called Aer, Aeri, or Noodle, or sometimes Noodly Dude. I don't even know anymore. Lol"
FinalFantasy,fcymgiu,t1_fcye960,1578082740.0,"I know, me too. I hated battles in that game because of that.  Now if I'm feeling nostalgic for crisis core, I just watch it on YouTube."
