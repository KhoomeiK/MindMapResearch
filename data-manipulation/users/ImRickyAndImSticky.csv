Hunting,ffg265n,t1_fffw8w5,1579896838.0,What's your reasoning behind being opposed to it? Genuinely curious. What do you hunt and why is it less important than a lion? Population is strictly controlled on all game species in the United States so it can't be that you think the lion population is in danger. Is it just that you have an emotional attachment/love for lions more than whatever animals you kill?
Hunting,ffg1tqq,t1_fffnb90,1579896627.0,I think people are reading your comment wrong. I think they're reading it as you bitching about hunting lions.
Hunting,ffg19gt,t1_fffs1lo,1579896276.0,"Exactly. People tend to think we're not the same as a chimp who figured out to break and sgaroen twigs to poke termite hills or an assembly line of rocks to crack nuts open. Or a beaver building a dam to manipulate water ways or a huge lodge for it's family to live in. We're just far more intelligent in the technology sense and have learned how to manipulate the environment in some pretty impressive ways compared to other animals.

Everything humans have ever made, including life support systems, vaccines, firearms, motor vehicles, methamphetamine etc... it's nature at work. All natural."
AskReddit,ffflbqr,t3_et6wi3,1579886435.0,"There is this fucking cave that has been closed down and barred up for the last 20+ years due to a viral disease in the bat populations that is spread through their shit, since before I was born. Only accessible to authorized biologists/higher level authority figures with a key. I've walked through the woods my entire life wondering what it looks like inside, so that's where I'd go, faster than a heartbeat."
AskReddit,ffccn8c,t1_ffccagu,1579796576.0,"Same here. I wouldn't say I'm religious either but I've sort of come up with justifications on why there could possibly be an afterlife at least. It does make me feel better too, and if that's all it ever does, I'm okay with it lol."
AskReddit,ffcbxqv,t3_esps5n,1579796134.0,"The possibility that there isn't an afterlife and we really are just hunks of meat and water tripping out on chemical reactions.

On one hand it seems great. All the suffering, pain and sadness you feel is gone immediately upon death. It's like it never happened. But that also means that all the happiness, joy, excitement and love you felt is all for nothing as well. I'm not necessarily scared to die, I'm just scared that this life is all there is."
KitchenConfidential,ffcbi1t,t1_ffc7217,1579795861.0,"Exactly lmao. The owner of the restaurant I work for got upset because he overheard me saying ""Of course I only work here for a paycheck"". Like what the fuck do you expect homie? I'm not burning half of my life away here because I like the place or any of the people here. Apparently there is a large chunk of the population who thinks it's wrong to only work somewhere for a paycheck."
AskReddit,ffcb3z9,t1_ffbv1k1,1579795613.0,"Sort of the same for me, I'm a cook. Grew up learning how to cook from multiple people including some professional chefs and then went to culinary school. I regret the fuck out of that. I hate doing it for a living and now I feel stuck in the industry."
trashy,ffbl33y,t1_ffb1w2o,1579770546.0,"I drive a Toyota Yaris. Basically a smaller and even bitchier version of the prius. It's got a hole in the exhaust system somewhere right now and I can literally hear my car while semis pass me on the highway. It's fucking ridiculous lol.

Thankfully only quoted $300 to repair it, but better than having to fully replace it."
Cringetopia,ffbkq65,t1_ffb6ruq,1579769993.0,Sometimes time spent doing nothing is better than time spent doing something monotonous that require attention.
Cringetopia,ffbkoad,t1_ffaiepp,1579769914.0,"I mean it takes less than five seconds per survey. Basically asking what day you went to a certain store) location. I normally don't bother sending pictures of my receipt which they ask for and get random amounts each time, isn't based off of the information you provided. So a total of maybe 2 minutes per week and I make like $3 per week. I'm sure if you do a lot more traveling or shopping you'd get more from it."
NatureIsFuckingLit,ffbk9p5,t3_eshgpa,1579769322.0,I was once called racist because I thought these animals were beautiful. Same thing when I said a pair of white lions were pretty.
creepyasterisks,ffbk144,t1_ffbjx63,1579768983.0,You want some too bitch?
DumpsterDiving,ffbk0b4,t3_esheti,1579768951.0,WHAT. This and finding an entire case of beef jerky has been my life long dumpster diving dream lmao
creepyasterisks,ffbjmx1,t1_ffbfnz0,1579768426.0,I swear to God I'd suck you off for hours for making me laugh at thatt
natureismetal,ffbixu6,t1_ffb6f9k,1579767456.0,"Yeah, like not bathing for a year and then racking your teeth across your entire arm and swallowing the coop that comes off. If you said ""No"" to me asking if you had a big boner right now, you'd not only be a man, but also a liar."
natureismetal,ffbiuy2,t1_ffahlv6,1579767347.0,Someone tell Joe Rogan. I can't wait to hear him snarl and pant about how terrifying Moose are.
Hunting,ffb8p5w,t1_ffaqy3a,1579755243.0,"Yeah, I live in Ohio. Lake Erie and a few other bodies of Easter are heavily regulated. Most everything else in a majority of water is based off of size and bag limit though, doesn't matter what time of year you harvest them."
PETA,ffb8j36,t1_faca3a6,1579755038.0,"Probably feeding their obligate carnivorous cat or dog, like a typical hypocritical vegan."
PETA,ffb8gkt,t3_e8ezjl,1579754953.0,"Do your best to eat meat that is local and from a farm that is transparent on the treatment of your animals, or hunt them yourself. That's what I do. I eat meat but don't support horrid factory farming"
PETA,ffb8e83,t3_e8l5vu,1579754878.0,"I hope you don't have pets in general. Your cats and dogs eat hundreds of thousands of animals per year. Not only that, but a majority of cheap fish are fished for by what basically amounts to slaves from third world countries."
