SarahSnark,ffa2pqb,t3_eres8x,1579726696.0,"I’ve been super busy and not keeping up with Sarah snark lately because she got really boring after getting the dog. Well, catching up on fridgegate today was like Christmas. 

She will never care about her plastic use. She belongs to a political party that thinks climate change is a hoax. Reusable water bottles are for dirty hippie communists and feminists. She doesn’t give a shit."

blogsnark,ff98rnn,t1_ff8x4ir,1579707463.0,Nice subtle passive-aggressively blaming Thomas for buying sweets.
blogsnark,ff989xh,t1_ff95bk5,1579707144.0,I vividly remember when my mom threw my blankie out because I was “too old” for it! Thanks Mom.
blogsnark,ff779h3,t1_ff6xn06,1579642514.0,The J Crew one has bracelet sleeves so it’s supposed to be that short. I like the style myself because I have T-Rex arms.
blogsnark,ff773k2,t3_erz8w8,1579642419.0,"And naturally instead of looking for a classic blazer for work, ie the kind of blazer I’m sure many of her readers wear, she wanted a casual one to wear with jeans and ended up with what is basically a structured cardigan."

SarahSnark,fepivbg,t1_feoq0kt,1579321639.0,Agreed that Gladiator was way better. The Netflix series didn’t really seem to have a cohesive story to tell other than he may have been gay.
UpliftingNews,felu8x7,t3_epr8p8,1579231074.0,I’ve been wondering if Ken might donate some of his $1 million from the GOAT tournament to cancer in honour of Alex.
blogsnark,fegmdna,t1_fefvkiw,1579097154.0,She’s definitely been talked about before. I’m dying to know what she’s like IRL.

AskReddit,fecl96g,t1_fechq32,1578976686.0,"One time a guy didn’t say anything to me until we were getting naked, and then he said “I probably should warn you...” as he pulled off his underwear. My eyes fell out of my head. It was huge. It was as big around as a Coke can. It was a frightening prospect. I wish I had been prepared."

blogsnark,fe5ongw,t3_ensqh1,1578872282.0,Is anyone else watching Servant? I have no idea wtf is going on but I’m loving it.

ottawa,fe506np,t3_enqwev,1578864461.0,"I wear them on icy days after having a bad fall on a slippery sidewalk a couple years ago and busting my knee. It’s actually really difficult and slippery to walk on them indoors, so take them off."

ottawa,fe24kej,t1_fe1x5mi,1578834392.0,I always joked that if there was a nuclear disaster I would ignore the alert and go back to sleep because it has the same sound as a missing child alert... and this morning I did.
SarahSnark,fdtgnk2,t1_fdsrre8,1578716489.0,This burn was brought to you by the letter S as in snap
servant,fdt02py,t1_fdrlh7j,1578710180.0,"They may not be able to roll over at that age but is VERY common advice in every baby book, etc, to never leave a baby unattended on a changing table. Dorothy would have known that."
servant,fdsxu0v,t1_fdsa7tf,1578709353.0,"I can’t believe that article is 10 years old, it has really stuck with me all these years. As soon as I saw Dorothy carrying in all the groceries I knew she would leave him in the car."
blogsnark,fdod70v,t1_fdobep6,1578603001.0,"I was at Sephora recently and the Bite section was basically empty and there was a sign saying they’re getting ready for new stuff, did they discontinue a bunch of products??"
blogsnark,fdocnwg,t3_emcxjv,1578602747.0,"The one product I’ve used the longest is Clinique cream eyeliner. I think I’ve been using it since I was 13. I’ve tried tons of other kinds but keep coming back to it. And for my sensitive dry skin, Aveeno lotion. I go through buckets of it. Oh and Burt’s Bees lip balm. I have one in every bag, at my desk, bedside table, etc. Another one of those products I come back to over and over. 

Other than that, my makeup and skincare are constantly evolving but I use a lot of Ordinary, Cerave, Urban Decay and Nars."
blogsnark,fdnj59s,t1_fdnhmpt,1578586899.0,It sounds like they will continue to do work on behalf of HM so I assume the patronages will remain. Many members of the royal family have patronages and aren’t full time royals.
blogsnark,fdnhdak,t1_fdng55p,1578585836.0,I don’t know how she came to be considered a reliable source on anything. She’s not a reporter.
blogsnark,fdnf5tk,t3_elx4w9,1578584493.0,The absolutely vicious press coverage this morning (including that piece of garbage Piers Morgan) pretty much proves Meghan and Harry’s point.
blogsnark,fdnf0js,t1_fdnema2,1578584406.0,The royal family owns land. They get their money from their estates. Charles’ duchy alone is worth a billion or so.
arresteddevelopment,fdmhh1t,t3_em3t15,1578550056.0,It’s not the pronunciation that bothered me.
AskReddit,fdm4nbl,t1_fdldhpf,1578539691.0,"And people litter all winter and it gets covered up by snow, so when it melts in the spring there is garbage, cigarettes and dog poop everywhere."
30ROCK,fdm3vko,t1_fdlpasc,1578539175.0,"It was originally the catchphrase of Jack’s hero, Reagan."
blogsnark,fdllnm4,t1_fdlkcvw,1578526823.0,"Yup. I think people always saw William & Harry as a package deal and expected that Harry would follow in his brother’s footsteps. Marry a nice dutiful white British girl and spend the rest of his life shaking hands, kissing babies and toeing the line. But he’s always been different and I think he may have chosen to step back even without Meghan. William unfortunately doesn’t have that option. 

I don’t think much will actually change with Meghan and Harry other than being less visible in the UK and probably skipping big royal events. They certainly aren’t giving up their titles or living as private citizens."
blogsnark,fdkmdrb,t1_fdjwf9q,1578506556.0,"Holy hell, what a sad situation. That poor family. I wonder what it’s like to be so deeply religious you  genuinely believe dead people can come back to life."

AskReddit,fdj9ti2,t1_fdj0vob,1578462648.0,"As a woman I insist on paying my half if the date sucked. I guess that sounds counterintuitive (like, why not at least get a free drink out of it) but I don’t want to feel like I owe someone something if I know I will never see him again. But if the date went well, then I’m faux surprised and thankful."
blogsnark,fdj6qqq,t1_fdj5oe2,1578460011.0,They’ve really been pushing content from the “team’s” personal lives HARD and I don’t get it. Emily is the face of the brand. Who cares about some assistant’s proposal or where their copywriter gets her brows waxed.
