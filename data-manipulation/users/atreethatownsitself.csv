tortoise,fff77dl,t1_ffenk9r,1579877455.0,Just a wall! We let them dig out a burrow every year every year. The rain was becoming an issue so we blocked the entrance. This one was trying to find another way in and it didn’t quite work out.
AmItheAsshole,ffe2pep,t1_ffe25zn,1579835146.0,I never said it’d be a good insult.
AmItheAsshole,ffe053o,t1_ffdzlgs,1579833278.0,"Hell, why stop there? Get creative! String like four or five of them together if you’re feeling daring."
NatureIsFuckingLit,ffanc32,t1_ffacxrw,1579739987.0,I’ve always wanted to try but trying to explain that to someone at a desk where you don’t know the lingo or what TF you’d even say to sign up. I probably wouldn’t even make it half the drive to the place before backing out. I think this is badass as hell.
Caudex,ff7pcj7,t3_es4bh5,1579655081.0,That looks so cool! What a great gift.

dice,feut91h,t1_feukmco,1579389675.0,"Damn, I was worried about that. Never been an overall fan of speckles but there’s a few sets I’m in love with. Your whole collection is gorgeous, you have a good eye! Thank you for the answer."
dice,feuhqse,t3_eqk3xw,1579386624.0,"Love the layout, keeps them visible. What is the white/blue speckle set under the wisteria? 4th column from left, 3rd down."

IndoorGarden,feov12h,t1_feosb4f,1579306023.0,"I came very very close to nuking this one to orbit the first couple of weeks. The only thing I can recommend is well draining soil, soak every 2-3 days and find a spot that is ‘sunkissed’ and bright but not directly in light. Hope you can find something that works for you!"
pens,feoq3vl,t1_feooqjb,1579303829.0,Obvious winner. You chose well.
HumansBeingBros,feomojo,t3_eq6fcn,1579302280.0,"My dad did this for my cousin when they went out to dinner. Not mild wheezing, but legit life ending choking. They recognized what had happened after but continued with dinner like normal and everything was okay. Hours later, my dad gets a call from this brother and my aunt crying and thanking him for saving my cousins life. It didn’t really register to anyone in the moment how bad it could have been."

aww,feof8ro,t1_feo6000,1579299336.0,Thanks! I thought the same. Love that the city recognizes the “Son of the Tree That Owned Itself” as an equal in its place.

IndoorGarden,feo3vfo,t1_fenxk2j,1579294749.0,I’m PM you after work today if that’s okay. Always down to trade plants.
IndoorGarden,feo3rm0,t1_feo23fc,1579294685.0,"The lack of green means no chlorophyll, which is essential for photosynthesis. Like albino avocado seedlings (first example I could think of) only last until the seed source runs out, they can’t produce what they need to survive on their own.


This is super fragile to burning and yours probably will be too. It sits in a kitchen window that only sees direct sunlight for like 30min-1 hr a day, if that. Basically a lot of indirect light, but it and the sun are brief acquaintances."
aww,fenyl6e,t1_fenxl3o,1579292658.0,This is why u/shittymorph is such a goddamn success. You want to be mad when you fall for it again but he still gets you every damn time.
IndoorGarden,fenwqk6,t1_fenkw4c,1579292025.0,Might be able to make that happen. The variegation has been pretty consistent.
IndoorGarden,fenkjgk,t1_fendcfi,1579286658.0,Thank you! Almost killed it the first time around but it seems to be much happier now.
IndoorGarden,fenk0za,t1_fenhthp,1579286351.0,"It rarely gets direct sun. It lives in a kitchen window, only took it outside for the picture."

DicePorn,fe6eadj,t1_fe5czh0,1578888350.0,You nailed it. Especially since OP only has that same d20. Very cool looking dice.
HumansBeingBros,fdw5n4l,t1_fdw2iix,1578755341.0,"Don’t give up. You’ll find one. I randomly hit this guy up in WoW after 6 months of playing alone because his guild ad in trade chat was something like “hearing voices, think you’re going crazy? Join the Insane Asylum today!”  I had never wanted to make friends in an mmo but I needed help and he was funny. 6 years later, I rely heavily on that guy and a couple others in the core group. We’ve met up in person and we all couldn’t be more different, but I love them. I really do.


You’ll find your people and you’ll know it when you do. Don’t give up!"
estoration,fdttreo,t1_fdthmtd,1578722069.0,I think you helped restore a more natural looking mouth shape than the other picture. Really well done!

ww3memes,fdj4lur,t1_fdj1z57,1578458301.0,"There are actually four sequels to Ender’s Game. They go more into the world he left behind after the war. Ender’s Shadow is a stand-alone and it’s Ender’s Game from Bean’s perspective. I love and hate it for different reasons, but its a close favorite to the original."
ww3memes,fdj1vet,t1_fdj1s25,1578456289.0,"Nah, I was too . Love the book, not a huge fan of the movie. Think Ender’s Shadow might be my favorite between the two books though, haven’t read any of the others."
ww3memes,fdj1pwy,t1_fdhxdky,1578456182.0,"Seriously, it’s only been 35 years. Could have waited a bit longer before spoiling the ending. I was just getting around to reading it!"
DicePorn,fdj1c7c,t3_elhklp,1578455919.0,"Very, very cool. I’m all for unique dice and stepping away from the typical framed metal set style is even better. Can’t wait for the Kickstarter!"
