While Murdoch is definitely skewing our elections, people who permit the LNP to get away with this by blaming their figurehead/scapegoat are complicit as well.

In Australia, we do not vote for the person, we vote for the party. This has always been the way our elections are run. To then turn around and blame just the person, instead of the party we voted for, essentially gives them a get out of jail free card whenever they need it. Much in the same way companies elect CEOs to absorb controversy and then fire them to appease stakeholders, the LNP rotates its leaders in order to dodge controversy. If we continue down this road, ScoMo will be out before the next election and the uninformed voting public will not even associate his wrongdoings with the LNP. We already saw the exact same thing happen when the public at-large celebrated Abbott's removal, despite nothing changing as his party stayed in power."
