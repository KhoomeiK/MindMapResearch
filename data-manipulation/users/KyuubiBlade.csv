DestinyTheGame,ffqu8b1,t1_ffqu55e,1580143757.0,Doesn’t change the fact that he’s my favorite Titan and I love him and believe he should have more.
DestinyTheGame,ffqo0hh,t3_eugpc8,1580139592.0,I personally don't mind it. I feel a little special when I am there for certain events and I love hearing stories about the things I wasn't there for. But I can definitely see why players are opposed to this philosophy.

destiny2,ffqjdu7,t3_euodui,1580136223.0,Just pull Symmetry out of you collections. Ark Seeker mode does wonders. Your dynamic charge doesn't even have to be that high.

DestinyTheGame,ffjjhtq,t1_ffjio83,1579999630.0,Apparently I meant both.
DestinyTheGame,ffjil3c,t1_ffjiikp,1579999025.0,Wait they aren’t? Are all gauntlets like this? I don’t actually know since I pretty much play on warlock exclusively.

destiny2,fffood0,t1_fffoly6,1579888472.0,"Either way, it’s a strong ability that comes at a price for its full potential."
destiny2,fffoeeo,t1_fffo8wv,1579888302.0,"The thing with HHSN Contraverse Hold is that in exchange for a really bad super, the neutral game is so so good. I honestly think that it’s a pretty fair trade."
destiny2,fffnth8,t1_fffnkts,1579887952.0,"I suppose, HHSN actually sorta gives it a level playing field. Hunters have their one hit throwing knives and every single Titan melee is a OHKO move. Hunters and Warlocks are just able to OHKO with some range."
destiny2,fffb1nl,t1_fff762k,1579880012.0,I saw it one shot 3 people at the same time yesterday in Crucible. Never before have I glided away so fast.
destiny2,fffay2q,t1_fff6xej,1579879948.0,Really? That’s actually really impressive. But maybe it was effective this time only because that warlock happened to have a high resilience and/or recovery stat. I don’t and I typically rely on just being aggressive and being faster than my opponents. I tried the overshield and it was basically useless even tho I had tier 5 resilience.
destiny2,fff6lnc,t1_fff63ou,1579877024.0,"Neither does HHSN. It only does that when you combine Contraverse with the Oppressive Darkness perk from last season. Otherwise it just does a lot of damage. This, along with a high discipline stat is the only way you can constantly spam the ability. You just need the helmet to spam your melee."
destiny2,fff62v4,t1_fff57w6,1579876644.0,"Contraverse does provide a small shield, but it’s basically useless. The main perk is that it gives back a random amount of grenade energy on a supercharged grenade kill. The shotgun thing is quite easy to work around since most shoulder charging Titans are holding W while they play.  Besides it’s very easy to work around with middle-tree’s “death from above” melee."
destiny2,fff4cn9,t3_et9z4r,1579875367.0,"Gonna get hate for this but when are we gonna stop talking about Contraverse Hold when An Insurmountable Skullfort does the same thing for a Striker Titan’s shoulder charge, but it regenerates the melee fully every single time?"

wholesomememes,fff10z8,t1_ffef1qr,1579872718.0,Except they’ll eventually learn how to use the bathroom so they don’t shit themselves in public places like Frat Parties.
Nicegirls,fff0y40,t3_et9haf,1579872650.0,I had an aneurism trying to read this.
DestinyTheGame,ffcg22m,t1_ffcfu3e,1579798685.0,Usage of OEM is still insane. Now I’m not saying I have any problems with Eye of Another World as it is. This idea is just to level the playing field a bit since Warlocks are the only class without good wallhacks.
destiny2,ffc1ict,t3_esosi4,1579789164.0,WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT MY H(AIR)UNTERS?!

DestinyTheGame,ff6nung,t1_ff6njry,1579631177.0,Did that. Maybe I’ll stop getting hate.
DestinyTheGame,ff6nsgs,t1_ff6n802,1579631141.0,How would it make things easier? Have you done the Acrius and Divinity quests?

It was the first exotic quest I ever completed, it actually takes some skill to use, and it just looks so sick with the Panama Ravine Ornament.

destiny2,fend9xs,t3_epxzso,1579282217.0,"I understand why people hate HHSN, but come on. It is one (1) OHKO ability on one tree of one subclass. Not to mention that the super that the ability is attached to is so bad that you’re actually more vulnerable in super than you are out of it. When are we gonna talk about his Titans have a one hit melee in every single subclass, and if a striker Titan is wearing Skullfort, he can go forever. Contraverse only gives a random amount of energy back on a kill. If you kill something with skullfort, you get your melee back immediately. As long as you are killing things with your melee, you go forever."
