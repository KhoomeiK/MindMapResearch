AskReddit,ffywh9c,t3_evqtcc,1580356882.0,"I’ll just say, for me at least, I used to be regarded as very outgoing and upbeat. Yesterday my coworker told me that I’m very calm and quiet. I moved to a new place not too long ago so these are people I’ve only know about 3 months.

These people don’t even know the real me, they just have only know the depressed me."

migraine,ffpsz22,t3_euj5nz,1580104571.0,I have had it happen several times! On the rare occasion it does happen to me I get it before/while it goes from headache to full migraine. Never gotten it checked out or anything but it doesn’t happen very often for me.
AskReddit,ffpsc02,t1_ffpay18,1580103923.0,"How did you manage to cut of those who weren’t so obviously toxic. My significant other has gone through a lot of the same thing and cut of the major toxic people from childhood but I know they don’t get treated by some people the way one should be treated. My S/O just lets those toxic people make excuses constantly and even though it hurts, they push it to the side and just accept it.

I’m trying to help them get the courage up to see how they shouldn’t be treated such ways without just telling how shitty those people are. I want there to be the confidence to know how they should be treated and they don’t deserve bullshit, they’re really worth so much more than they think.

I’m not sure if I’m even being remotely helpful at all but it’s not my place to tell those toxic people off. I just hate my s/o feeling such a way and they push it to the side because they’ve been treated that way their whole life."

JustBootThings,ffpbpk4,t1_ffmqw2x,1580091061.0,"Same with my BCT, about 90% 88M all of them took it for the bonus and after people talking about it there a bunch of them were crying to our DS they wanted to switch. The DS was an 88M and just told them to quit their bitching, they can’t change it.

I was one of the few that wasn’t an 88M."

I feel like since it is up to the residents after they’ve spent what has been a life/afterlife of fulfillment, it’s their choice to go peacefully. Just like in some religions you want to reach “Nirvana” this is what I would compare that to. Once you reach Nirvana you may go peacefully and part from existence."

quotes,ffe8kqu,t1_ffe83l5,1579839652.0,"Here’s the thing. She is calling out these world leaders who have yet to do much about the climate change issue.

I’m not a world leader, I’d say I’m just an average person. So if a person like myself, sees this young kid and feels compelled to do what they can to help (recycling, less meat intake, etc.), many others may as well. It’s just like this plastic straw trend, people are eliminating plastic straws (which is, to be fair, a small portion of plastic waste) but sparks into larger things like getting rid of plastic bags at store and so on and so forth.

She knows she’s not a world leader, but calling out those people in power that haven’t taken action, inspires others to stand behind that issue. Makes more people take action, whether it is what they can do themselves or by informing their representatives that it is an issue they care about (which would ideally matter but doesn’t seem to work that why).

One person can’t change it and she’s not going to save the world, but that message reaches SO MANY people and maybe all of those people actually can make a difference."

TooAfraidToAsk,fe6m95u,t3_eml40c,1578895701.0,"My wife doesn’t get it either. She’s always asking why certain pairs are so expensive and such. How I told her is, depending on the shoe there is limited released when they are for sale, if you don’t get the shoe at the point of release, if you ever want it you’ll pay double or more of the original cost.

I personally like to collect different pairs, things I like and aren’t “valuable” and also shoes that are harder to come by and I could sell.

Everyone had their hobbies, some music, some video games and some shoes etc. We’re all into different things, so even though my wife doesn’t get it, she knows I like it.

Edit: I might add that I even have two pair I have yet to ever wear because I may resell them due to their value going up after they sold out!"
