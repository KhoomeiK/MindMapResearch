Since youve made them aware of it and theyve allowed you to go on medical treatment, theyre supposed to hold the job for you for a reasonable amount of time or make accomodations as such.

the reason why they are asking you for your termination is to show its not linked to any medical issue and so that you cant come back and say they terminated you based on your medical status- if they did, this would open them up to a lawsuit.

its the same as if a woman was pregnant, goes on leave, and then gets terminated. however, if the woman decides to resign, theres no re-course.

However, for anything medical you do have to let them know of a time line, the reason is a business still needs to operate and in canada, must provide a reasonable amount of notice if they do intend to terminate."
