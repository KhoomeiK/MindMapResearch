LateStageCapitalism,fgjwhxr,t1_fgjehwe,1580852748.0,"We have private insurance as well. Private insurance gets you better prices in private hospitals. (0 waiting time if you pay up for private)

If you don't have insurance you can go to a public hospital and you don't pay (clinics and hospitals are free, waiting times for casual consultations can be a few months)

Either way you don't die. Money buys you another option, not the solution.


Emergencies are instant in public hospitals as well. You fall and break bones/have an heart attack etc are all free and you get attended to immediately.

So while London gets richer, those cities get poorer. People have the need to migrate while they really don't want because tier 1 cities have longer comutes, worse housing.
