I'm a white (non republican) gun owner, who stands behind all persona owning guns. I'm not a fan of open carry in general, but don't act like every white guy who owns a gun is bad and doesn't care about you. The police are a corrupt organizations founded on a flawed basis, and they need reform. Delete this cuz I'm white now."

Libertarian,fet74pt,t1_feswwt8,1579372400.0,"I’d be okay with an investigation into every fatal shooting, and non-fatal shootings that are questionable. For the fatal shootings, it should be very clear when it was a justified shooting. So that doesn’t take up much time. 

Sometimes they should be lower charges, yes. But the instances where someone is literally standing hands up, or the case if the counselor laying in the ground with his hands in the air, that’s murder."

Libertarian,fesruz3,t1_fesowtz,1579368365.0,"Cops absolutely go into dangerous situations which sometimes do require deadly force. But I don’t think every situation does, and could be handled by non-lethals. 

Then you come to the situations where people literally have their hands up, there could be no threat of danger at all, yet they still shoot. Modern police have a “warrior mindset”. They think everyone is out to kill them and that’s simply not true. Because if this, many are way to willing to use extensive force, and justify it by saying that they felt scared. If I felt afraid of a cop and used force against the cop, I will be punished more harshly than if it were anyone else. But many people have a legitimate reason to be afraid of a cop. 

Looking at the article I cited in police deaths, the three states with highest police deaths are California, New York, and Texas. Don’t know what the causation of this is, or what the breakdown of urban/rural is."
Libertarian,fesqiay,t1_fesoiio,1579367963.0,"I’m not saying at all that police shouldn’t have the ability to use deadly force. It’s a fact of the job. But, I want outside investigations into every shooting. And if a shooting happens of someone with their hands up, like we see in so many videos, there needs to be swift punishment and pursuit of a murder conviction. I don’t think that would harm the police in any way. 

And as much as it may seem, I’m not anti-cop. I just see there are a lot of problems with the modern system of policing."
Libertarian,fesn2e8,t1_fesjcaw,1579366978.0,"No, their job is not to kill citizens. That’s simply wrong and if you’re okay with that then you’re wrong to. Government sanctioned killings are wrong. 

Sometimes, deadly force is the appropriate response, but not nearly as much as it’s used by the police in the US. I don’t support police killing gang members. People pulling out knives is a risk, but unless there’s a hostage, or the person is right on them, there’s still no reason to go to deadly force yet. The fbi keeps track of “justifies police homicides” but not unjustified, and even so many Pd don’t report this stuff anyway. And it may be a small percentage, but the fact is that I can be killed by a cop tomorrow for doing nothing at all wrong and that cop can walk away with no charges at all. That’s a fact."
Libertarian,feryg7s,t1_feplatr,1579359610.0,"I asked this very question to someone on r/protectandserve the other day, and they got real pissed about it. 

One officer had said “always be kind and polite, and have a plan to kill everyone you meet”. I asked if that meant I should have a plan to kill them, or if that idea only applied to cops. Another officer responded saying “you can kill a cop, but good luck with life in prison”. 

If they kill us without reasonable justification they get paid leave and MAYBE terminated from their job if it’s bad enough. If I killed one of them at all, I’d be in prison the rest of my life"

They kill 10 times more people than die in their profession, and they all have a twisted idea that everyone is trying to kill them, so they’ve got to kill them first.

[In 2019 1,310 civilians were killed by cops. ](http://copcrisis.com)  10 times as many citizens were killed by cops than cops died at all in the line of duty in 2019. 

Their job is NOT to kill citizens. They shouldn’t feel confident in killing anyone, lest they have a gun visible. There are many other ways to deal with situations. ESPECIALLY situations where people have their hands up."
