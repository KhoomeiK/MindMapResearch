Coffee,ffbt4mo,t3_ess1of,1579781784.0,"1: Wet the filter. This prevents that you will taste the paper in your coffee.
2: let the boiled water cool down a bit, otherwise you will burn the powder which will cause a bitter taste.
3: weigh around 6 grams of coffee for 100ml of water (you can change this depending on your taste, but this is a nice basic weight to volume ratio to start experimenting with)
4: don't grind the beans too big or too small. The water should take approximately 3 minutes to go through the ground coffee. Too fast and the coffee will taste just watery. 5oo slow, and the coffee will be too strong.

This is all personal, how i do it. These aren't rules. Pour over gives you pretty much all control you want over making coffee, in my opinion."
