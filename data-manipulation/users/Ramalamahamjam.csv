aww,ffc0gqz,t1_ffbfwjk,1579788367.0,We used to have feral cats I tamed them with mayo on my fingers they had to come up to me to lick it off. Finally my dad got tired of all the cats around and took them to a farm... no he didn’t kill them I went with him when we released them at a barn. The owner said it was infested with rodents and needed some “mousers” around.

Braves,ff7q5q9,t1_ff7ldgq,1579655656.0,And if we want to free up the spots for Waters and Pache we will most likely want to trade Ender and he has no value sitting on the bench.
Reformed,ff62vsn,t1_ff5yhgi,1579617760.0,"I don't think he just think it's unimportant for unbelievers he genuinely thinks that parts of the Old Testament may not be true. He said that if you believe that all of the OT must necessarily be true then your faith is a house of cards that may come tumbling down if you discover that the walls of Jericho didn't. He can say he believes that the entire Bible is infallible, but that former statement betrays that."

aww,femturk,t3_epyj0v,1579269437.0,I would never touch a wild animal because if it bites you and then runs away you have to get the rabies vaccination. Even if it wasn't showing any symptoms you just never know. I got bit by a stray dog as a child. It wasn't showing any symptoms and it was an accidental bite as I fed it. Luckily it didn't run away. We took it to a vet for observation and it died quickly after being there. They sent the head off to check and it didn't have rabies thankfully but that whole thing makes me much more cautious.
books,fejucod,t1_fejnp5r,1579186045.0,"I read Cat’s Cradle and didn’t really like it, then tried Breakfast of Champions and really really hated it and realized Vonnegut just wasn’t for me. I can see why people like him but his writing style is like nails on a chalkboard for me."

Reformed,fehqo0q,t1_fehko8u,1579121950.0,I heard him say that believing in the Old Testament as being necessarily infallible is making the Christian faith into a house of cards that will fall if we find out Jericho's walls didn't.
television,fegc44c,t1_fegblz9,1579087128.0,"When I got to the season 3 premier and saw the Flash battling another speedster I was so done. Reverse Flash was good, but Zoom was an absolute bore, not going to keep watching the same stuff over and over"

Braves,fecg6z9,t1_fec8zw2,1578973141.0,But didn’t we also lose the ability to recruit from some areas? If I read correctly the areas we no longer have access to produces about 1/3-1/4 of the total new recruits.

Braves,fdlridx,t1_fdlom55,1578530770.0,"Ah, that makes sense then. But for the other seasons I remember seeing we open away like 75% of the time or something crazy like that."
Braves,fdlohvx,t3_elwqdl,1578528715.0,Why do Braves always open the season away? We even did when we had a brand new stadium.
